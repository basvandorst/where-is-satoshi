This is the same terrorist group implicated in a [suspiciously vague late-June report](
My comments then were that there were better ways to show evidence, such as a transaction id.  This time the [source article]( does include some probably unique transaction details, though not with a handy link.  Author Fanusie speculates that the transaction could be an operational test rather than an actual donation.


Immediately we see another call to taint coins and destroy financial privacy, without any hint of due process or recourse.  At least Mike Hearn's conversations kept those considerations in mind, LOL.  Fanusie is apparently trying to offer Bitcoin transactions which get denied as often as credit card transactions, except there's no customer service to call.

**TL;DR:** With these improvements to privacy, it's possible to hand pre-signed transactions to an online service, while you relax on the beach.  If your LN channels stay honest, nobody learns anything from what you gave away.  If a LN channel tries to cheat then you get your payout and all that is revealed to the online third party is the single exit transaction.

Bingo on the beauty of the dream, and the criticality of decentralization, but ass-backwards on whether ASIC-resistant or botnets are the lesser evil.  ASIC centralization is **a phase, that will dissipate** as the hardware technology matures, and suppliers look for a broader base.  Botnets are not looking so vulnerable.  Massive caches of bitcoins will have been won during this ASIC-centralization phase, but control of current rules will pour like sand through a sieve.
POW is better than the politics of provable decentralization, because although its meritocracy can be disrupted, even then it is not corralled.  The modern state can [arrest more than 1000 people]( far easier than D'Angelo admits.  If POW's "dynamic multiparty" aspect of participation (see the Sidechains paper for discussion of DMMS) was weakened to a political selection process of 1000 people - that required a backup team to select the next 1000 people after a mass-arrest attack - then the system could easily be thrown into chaos.

* If you need to trust other people absolutely, to run your node, then you don't own your bitcoins.  (Segregated witness creates new ways for lite nodes to aggregate their work, and blurs the distinction about what nodes are doing safe leves of valiation.)
* If miners all want to be in large pools, to help their blocks win the race, then only large pool operators will choose the rules.  Larger blocks increase this risk, with the software we're running now.  There are improvements designed to lessen this risk, and the Core Dev roadmap involves implementing them before planning any hard-fork blocksize increase.

It's not simpler, because miners who choose not to upgrade persist the fork (for themselves as well as non-upgraded wallets), rather than continually trying to merge with the one valid longer chain, yet seeing their blocks dropped.

[separate reply for your post-edit additions]


One important technical fact, that you may not be aware of, is the extreme sensitivity of miner profitability to orphan risk.  In the post-SegWit world, devs are no longer protecting full nodes (because they have given users the option of better-than-SPV "lite nodes"), and their blocksize-shielding attention is used to respond to miner orphan risk.  SegWit really changed the game, and the roadmap really looks much clearer.  
Remember also, [there is no veto](
It's interesting to me (and probably to you, too) that they knew about witness segregation earlier, but were literally afraid to deploy it as a hard fork.  There is something real there, that is hard to get past.  I hope it is merely a fear we can totally overcome, with the practice of a few non-contentious hard fork rollouts. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 13:32:01
[Greg's response to segwit as a hard fork is scattered through this thread, but most succintly here](  In short, there's more to do so let's roll this out relying on miners for safety, and schedule the hard fork for when we know more.  
Hard forks have different dangers.  They rely on wallets updating their code *to be ready on the same day*.  And, of course, they are much easier to disrupt if there is contention...  The soft fork can roll out without breaking anyone's transactions if their wallet provider is negligent.

Right.  This means (many) Coffee transactions are not going to confirm on Settlement, assuming that backlogged Unified transactions are sorted by transaction fee on Settlement.
Non-Unified Coffee transactions will not be resellable at the same price that Unified Coffee outputs are.
Coffee users will lose money at exchange rate rather than paying fees to the Lighning Network, so they will switch to the Lighning network so that they can afford to pay Unification fees.
It's the same result as if the whole ecosystem made conservative choices, but more people get scammed along the way (for instance, by accepting non-Unified Coffee outputs) for not understanding all the complicated machinery in operation.

Rather than calling that "psychological baggage", we can call it "deployed infrastructure" in valuing, assaying, recycling, and (yes) communicating.  If you start to think about the costs involved in upgrading this infrastructure to deal with rhodium's different physical properties from gold (such as the difficulty of reaching that doubled melting point when purifying, and increased reliance on chemistry for testing), you can see that there is a logical explanation to staying with gold, even if everybody agrees that rhodium is rarer.

Complaints about the writing:
  * Miners could conceivably doublespend in a very visible attack, but never outright steal from cold storage.  There is a difference!
  * The report does not explain who is affected negatively by bigger blocks.  (Hint: block orphan rate.)
  * Segregated Witness need not be a hard fork.  A larger blocksize hard fork may come later, when more safety features (including IBLT) are implemented.
  * The people arguing for a formal governance structure were the ones who weren't at the conference.
  * Nobody's asking for guidance from Satoshi.

By adding time pressure **before** the second conference, he was suggesting that the devs were not planning to discuss real issues that matter for Bitcoin's lasting independence.  
Further, he certainly implied knowledge of the matter and a preference for BIP101.  By linking to the letter, he associated with its logic and conclusions.  
None of that is just wanting a solution.  At face value it's hurtful Brinksmanship, from a non-technical basis, under the guise of leadership.  If you're saying it was instead mere horrible communication, then there's a way to fix that: with good communication.
Coinbase has done a lot of work to get people on-board, working through difficulties in the banking system.  There is some credit to be given, but Brian burned through a lot of goodwill with this pushing.
Two useful suggestions: 
  * There is a widespread belief among devs that the transaction rate is not legitimately rising as fast as it appears to be.  They are chalking it up to "spam", and figure half of it will disappear with a little fee pressure, without visibly affecting userbase.  They don't know how many on-chain transactions Coinbase is creating every day.  Or they do know but don't consider them necessary.  If you want your free (to customers) transactions to not break your bank, then your team should communicate its recent transaction growth with all of the devs, publicly and in writing.
  * Coinbase needs long-term cheap transactions to remain trustworthy (with Vault, etc.) and that means putting a lot of work into payment channels.  There are a lot of UX issues to solve, and it wouldn't hurt to be part of that conversation from day one.  If Coinbase made (and budgeted for) a public commitment to being ready for payment channels when they arrive, everybody would benefit.
@_date: 2015-12-28 13:01:31
Useful.  You probably understand everything I'm about to explain.
Core devs aren't opposed to block size increases, but they refuse to entertain decisions driven by the threat of contentious forks.  
What, then, is their proposal?  To keep developing safer features for a later raise of the transaction limit (maybe blocksize, maybe not), while allowing maximum fee pressure to keep miners happy.  So far, they are steering the economics like a committee, but many voices are against this, and they are actively entertaining BIPs that use dynamic transaction rate adjustments (as your infographic seems fond of).  
Along these lines, we've seen Pieter's brilliant Segregated Witness technical solution that makes larger blocks safer by introducing "lite nodes" (more than SPV, but without the full blockchain); and everyone is behind it (even Gavin, when he's not busy sowing dissent by enabling XT's continued existence).  However, there is still much work to do on making larger blocks safer from the mining centralization perspective; where centralization pressure is based on orphan rate.
Behind all of this, the Lightning Network team (not just Rusty) is busting their collective ass to deliver ahead of expectations, which I think a lot of core devs want to give a little time to bear fruit, before committing to a more conservative roadmap.  Nobody's allowed to pressure them on that, because it's so damn important.  It's the genuine solution that allows Bitcoin to handle more transactions with better software, rather than requiring linearly better hardware infrastructure per node (and exponentially more network traffic in aggregate).
It's important to realize that these technical improvements (like segregated witness, Lightning Network, and the possibility for later dynamic blocksize adjustment BIPs with less effect on orphan rate) is what the XT crowd's ultimate leadership is afraid of, and working against, when they advocate hurried choices that happen to be irreversible.  It's too bad that it's easy for them to actively promote people making allegiance choices as rebellion against unfortunate (but logically consistent, based on altcoin promotion) censorship decisions.  I don't have a better recommendation for but I do advocate readers here use patience and additional subscriptions to and so that each case can be made at its best.

@_date: 2015-12-19 04:19:52
Four categories:
  * big blocks change which miners are at a disadvantage, due to bad connections causing blocks to arrive too slow and losing the block discovery race.  It makes them want to all centralize in big pools, which in turn means that very few people are effectively in charge of what rules the network uses.
  * resource attacks (scripts that are expensive to validate, but judged acceptable by the rules)
  * it cheapens destruction of the commons (UTXO exhaustion, blockchain growth)
  * increased node resources means a nudge towards trusting others for services that you could run yourself using p2p protocols.  Maybe you have to use some centralized block explorer API to find out if your transaction is confirmed.  This is an intangible security threat, because you'll feel fine until someone finds a way to act as your middleman, to steal your money.  
The "segregated witness" proposal tries to address these in combination, and if it's implemented then there are new ways to run lite nodes that make some of the dangers less drastic, but there are still significant effects that there is no working solution for.

@_date: 2015-12-24 04:25:08
Segwit helps the network be more secure even if not everybody is using the resources to run a full node.  It bridges the gap between full nodes and SPV nodes with a new class called "lite" nodes.  
This helps you be more secure at less cost (like using the resources of your cell phone instead of a VPS), and it therefore reduces the number of people who will get goxed.
This means that more network traffic can be pushed onto miners, **slightly later in the roadmap**, once a few other features are ready.  It's a huge step for scaling safely!
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:54:54


Let's not agree too violently.  :)  The point was that once mining hardware becomes obsolete less quickly, due to the end of Moore's 
Law, then it will become more sensible to investigate saving money with a new water heater that pays you back in bitcoins.


Again, we're agreeing that Chinese electrical infrastructure is less costly than elsewhere, which is not a statement about ASICs and is sufficient to explain the centralization.
I chose hydropower for a vivid image, because apart from your mention of the Chinese, it's also the factor giving an advantage to BitFury in Georgia and KnC in Sweden.
 


Oh I see, so you're saying their large operations could see additional benefits of scale.  I think their commerical focus is pretty tight.  BitFury is already down to a PUE of 1.02.  






I think the ASIC capital cost will get low enough that millions of hot water heaters will use it, kind of as a fun feature.  People aren't wholly rational about electricity usage.   
If water heater mining means you can subsidize running a local node for free, even if it means no profit, I think people will want it.  


Agree.  But since we're finding a "free" use for electrical waste heat, we can deal with some pretty bad margins.
Also, the countering effect is that if maintaining a mining node is no more difficult than raising a flag outside (which has a small cost in personal effort), perhaps as many people will do it - and for similar reasons.

Yes: 
  * the end of Moore's Law in ASIC design, 
  * [Moore's Law's levelling effect on the price of solar power]( (and thus all electrical power), and 
  * lots of room for improving mining pool software.


But it obviously means people could if they cared, which is what decentralization needs...  It needs a software problem, with hardware solved, so programmers can simplify the mining user experience and cross an adoption chasm.


Look at your own reasoning: it's not about access to ASICs, it's a statement about hydropower.  Five years from now you would make a statement about solar.  30 years later, nuclear or fusion.


Again, look at your own words: "haven't matured enough".  You implicitly agree that future phases will occur.  So not toasters (due to operating temperature), but hot water radiant heating.  There's an obvious opportunity for it, it cooperates well with solar energy, and it doesn't have any dumb fit problems other than hardware obsolescence - but see the end of Moore's Law for a counterargument to that last problem.

No, OP is not so wrong.  There will be additional correlation, and it will be due to a different kind of investor buying in.  
Right now we have mainly HODLers.  It's insanely difficult to get in (sign over your most revealing personal information to use a NYDFS-regulated exchange, banks refusing to wire to the most reputable exchanges and shutting down accounts, hand over cash in small personal transfers, etc.), and the computer security risks of getting coins safely to cold storage are still significant.  Who goes to the trouble to succeed?  Mostly those who know they won't need to sell their coins, but someday spend them.  Us.  The new kind of investor will park their coins in these ETFs and trust their (insure) broker.  Easy peasy.  They're going to be more fickle, and more keen to get to get the money back into another security if the price is right.
In 2008, when there was blood in the streets, GLD declined as well.  There was no question GLD was the safe haven of the moment, so what was the cause for that?  Did people want the risks of money market funds instead of the risks of paper gold?  Do the central banks have such powerful "stabilization" funds, that they can steer the global market even when stocks are hurting?  No and no.  Investors wanted cheap stocks, but they had to give something else up.  The whole reason they left their money in paper gold was so that they could sign into their brokerage and switch the money from GLD to a bargain equity in under a minute.  Smart money (hedge funds) moved safe haven assets earliest.  
Now, the 2008 dump on gold wasn't that bad, and GLD next had an amazing rise for several years, because once some gains are made then smart money wants to get back to its safe haven!  But the point is that *the safe-haven asset moved because equities did something*.  [That's correlation](
You might think we already have plenty of fickle day traders, so not much will change.  But there is currently a certain settlement friction.  The difficulty of managing frequent wire transfers between exchanges and brokerages prevents the kind of liquidity that will exist once the money can move from one ETF to another within the same (insured!) brokerage account.  The die-hards over in are special.  They give up liquidity opportunities to hold exchange-USD and exchange-BTC, and as a result probably exert a net dampening effect (despite the constant stream of players who are about to learn from the burn of high margin, when the stop-hunters next cut loose).   New buyers in the ETFs will be less special.  It is this different trader that changes the correlation.
There will be new dangers as well.  There will be [illegal naked shorting]( which can be prevented by teaching people to converting their ETF ownership into truly-owned bitcoins, where they HODL the private keys themselves.  
In order for the ETFs to be a net stabilizing influence, certain things need to occur:
  * large institutions need to buy in and think like HODLers;
  * HODLers need to accept that when the market is bubbly, smart money will be itching at the trigger to rotate out of safe haven assets and into cheap equities, until the stop-hunting ends in equities and the smart money comes back to its nice safe haven;
  * Bitcoin needs to attract many new investors, taking advantage of the benefits of brokerage liquity to grow out of small-time volatility faster than it is dragged down by correlation; and
  * we need to keep training people (and hedge funds) to HODL, aiming to secure their own private keys off the exchanges.
**TL;DR:**   There will be additional correlation, and it will be due to a different kind of investor buying in.

First, in your own words above, you are sure that "anything but Core" is the right answer.  That's not undecided.  It's blaming developers (trying to reach a technical consensus) for Theymos' moderation policy.  
Second, the moderation policy *consistently applies against contentious hard forks*, which you were implicitly supporting in your above statement (despite your present clarificaiton that it's not an endorsement).  If supporting a contentious hardfork is not your intention, and you want to propose a more selective consensus rule, to have useful discussions about blocksize hardforks while ruling out altcoins, then narrow your statements.
This community has weathered a lot of brigading, which you will remember made the escalation to agressive moderation more necessary.  It's not easy to support everyone's input, and does require better software.
I too think an eventual blocksize increase is an acceptable compromise (and Core's roadmap acknowledges that the discussion there is not over), but there remain plenty of ways of saying that without any fear of moderation!  
Really Erik, you claim nontechnical exemption, but you can clearly tell the difference between demanding a contentious fork and making competent technical proposals that aim for consensus.  There is plenty of room onboard.

A word is not enough, and your word is mostly incorrect.

However, the roadmap does explicitly discuss the eventual necessity of blocksize increases, once they are safe.

This is well written news (with good citations) about Bitcoin's primary weakness: demonization in the public eye, and regulations that scare the normals away from available onramps.
Why was this downvoted to zero (31% upvoted)?  Does reddit hivemind not want to know?  Do the vote manipulators not want us to know?  Is CCN getting residual downvotes for prior objectionable articles?
I think, perhaps, the child-level readership here cannot separate the news from the title.  The hivemind cannot upvote a declarative statement it does not agree with, e.g. "Attacks Revive Terrorism-Crypto Connection", even though that example is *already a statement about other people's propaganda*, and actually not a declarative statement indicating there should be such a connection.  Is that distinction too much to ask of readers here?  Possibly!  Restating the title to more simply say "European politicians think this is a chance to reguate Bitcoin" may get upvotes.
I hope it's that simple.  If the downvote manipulation was concerted enough to hide the primary attack on the primary weakness, then I should be much more worried about the forces of evil slithering around in their chosen darkness.

Yes.  To an old client, the value appears to come from a UTXO with a very lax signature script, one that anyone can spend, but the movement of the value is still tallied correctly.  Due to the soft fork, miners will only reassign the value according to the segwit signature rules, so it's not actually anyone can spend.
Meanwhile, the old client's signatures are still valid.


This isn't quite right, as you might already see from the above description.  Old clients can understand how values are moving, but have an incomplete understanding of segwit signatures which were actually accepted.

Eloquent but wrong.  If the transactions in question are still Bitcoin transactions (which is not a given, but is implied in the lingo), then they must be anchored via mining.  If Blocks are full (a safe bet that everyone can finally see instead of theorize about) and valuable off-chain transactions must be anchored, then block space customers will be willing to pay more.
Miners raise their fees to take the profit out of off-chain payments.  They already own the off-chain fee industry!  Since off-chain scaling will be peer-to-peer open source software, there will be no regulation or infrastructure to sap miner fees.  It will be a race to the bottom - an almost free service - and all the value in aggregate fees will go straight back to miners.
Miners are not competing with Bitcoin's off-chain payment solutions.  They own them and should nurture them for that reason.

**No.**  Not all miners will go dark into private contracts.  The rest will set the fee market, and a sensible wallet will know the fees.
If you have a "super urgent" transaction, then either you are using a payment channel like Lighning Network already, to make your zero-confirm transaction safe, or you are deluded.  Blocks can take an hour to find, in normal circumstances.  This has nothing to do with a spam attack.


Look, if you're coming up with crap like this on the fly, it's just obvious that **you don't understand how Bitcoin works**.  Wallets can sense fees in the mempool *as well as mined blocks*.  No such timing coordination problem as a "fee off" need ever exist.  Furthermore, if your wallet noticed its estimates sucked even during attempted fee bumps, it can model second derivative effects.  There's just **no reason to screw up the protocol** to protect people when we already know they need to choose competent wallets.

This is totally rational, because in my view the unholy fork will eventually fail (due to its code offering lesser resistance to the usual attacks, as detailed in the history books), *causing a swing in value back to the fork I help maintain*.  Money does rely on Metcalfe's Law, but for those who are evaluating the technical merits correctly, they can bet on others eventually joining their network.  
The specifics of threat, backed by the economic weight of those who agree, allow the fork to persist, rather than "resolve itself very quickly".  With proof-of-work split, one can fire up CPU-mining and abide.

I am not interested in Coinbase in any way.  I am only interested in the protocol, and the health of Bitcoin.  I keep my explanations technically sound.  I point out arguments which are unsound.
It's by Brian's own whining statments that we know segwit and LN are undue burdens to his development team.  Other teams are embracing the technical improvements.
I've thanked Coinbase for bringing users in the past, but don't want the help at the cost of harm to the protocol, especially in ways that affect p2p decentralization (such as who can validate transactions on home connections).
LN is off-chain transfer of strange-but-valid Bitcoin transactions.  Sidechains are like pegged altcoins in that sidechain transactions are not valid on the Bitcoin blockchain, except for the special un-peg operation to move value back to the Bitcoin blockchain.

When there is no better evidence to make a decision, it is normal to operate on the level of motives, reputations, and social wrongs.  
There is a better way to decide in Bitcoin, which is based on mathematical rules implemented in code.  We can understand each technical proposal and make a decision based on what its consequences will be.
The current moderation policy allows for this technical discussion, up to the point where a group decides to splinter off to achieve their goal.
I say this not because I support censoring XT or Classic.  I read their subreddits (which includes r/btc).  I think it's tragic that there's no way for those groups to have their say here, but I recognize that it's somewhat consistent, given that they're breakaway proposals.

In a world with competent RBF-wallets:

* initial estimates don't matter very much, because you get a second chance;

* **a spammer has no chance** of creating such expensive spam that they can exclude anyone with "TXs that people are desperate to include", because people buying anything more than coffee are going to have an average transaction size pretty near what the current average transaction size is for credit cards (about $150), and will be willing to pay up to credit card fees ($3), to make those transactions happen, which means a real attack would cost **over $100,000 per hour**;

In that it Adam recommends some action on your part to be safer, it's not different.

Segwit may not take a year.  You don't know.  Segwit does not put us back where we started, because it makes later developments safer.

Since UASF causes a chain split (until miners react to the clear economic signal), the hashrate will initially fall drastically.  Blocks are assumed to arrive every ten minutes, but with reduced hashrate they will be slower.

When dealing with urgent emergencies, one must keep in mind the USA PATRIOT Act, the Reichstag Fire Decree, and Problem-Reaction-Solution in general.
Regarding why not 2MB now, there is a known validation DDoS attack (chewing CPU), that must be addressed first.  It could delay blocks by more than 10 minutes if the blocksize were 2MB.  Core devs will never allow it, until they've rolled out the fix, as planned in their roadmap.

Separate reply for 100x:
We had a semantic difference in whether "on chain scaling" includes LN.  I see you're allowing it.  
Most definitions of "on chain scaling" mean big blocks that don't require "off-chain scaling", like LN.  
Be aware that with 200 million users making a couple 500-byte on-chain transactions per day (whether segwit or not), but also planning for a 2x capacity factor, then if you are running p2p, slowly synchronizing old blocks (so as not to be forever left SPV), and doubling your bandwidth usage to assist peers, then you will want to have over 100mbps allocated to Bitcoin alone.  If most American homes are on FCC-regulated radio and cable-channel-copper, they would be charged dearly for such access.  They will be driven to web services and SPV-fallback security levels.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:44:01


UASF would be likely to start with most of the 27% miner support that segwit currently has.
A miner boycott slows down transaction confirmations, which would raise fees and discourage transactions, but these are all somewhat intangible costs.  Sha256 miners striking from mining Bitcoin have much higher marginal losses from inactive capital and sunk cost in electricity agreements.  UASF users should quickly win this war of attrition.

No, they haven't.  And if you think this, then you haven't read the roadmap.  They have **plainly stated the opposite**.
From [Greg's statement of the roadmap](


incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls based on **allowing miners
to produce larger blocks** at some cost. These proposals help preserve
the alignment of incentives between miners and general node operators,
and *prevent defection between the miners from undermining the fee
market behavior that will eventually fund security*. I think that right
now capacity is high enough and the needed capacity is low enough that
**we don't immediately need these proposals, but they will be critically
important long term**. I'm planning to help out and drive towards a more
concrete direction out of these proposals in the following months.




    not be enough.  [...]  In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
    ready to implement ["moderate block size increase proposals (such
    as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase)"] as the need and
    the will arises, to keep the basic software engineering from being
    the limiting factor.

Information isn't uniformly distributed.  Sometimes convictions matter.
Profitable stakeholders extract value that could be left to others: by way of lower fees (leaving disintermediated bankers) or better privacy (leaving frustrated spies).  These two examples can be hard partners to win-win with!
Should we be happy with the paper-shuffling high-fee stakeholders we have in the existing fiat-based financial system; as well as its now-deep integration with the taxpayer-bailout and spying establishments?  Of course not: the human condition demands improvement.
Ultimately, Bitcoin holds the potential to support some business models better than others.  What will those successful business models be?  This is the information that is not uniformly distributed.  Because of the way that capitalism works, stakeholders fight for positions (i.e. their time and money investments) *that they have already committed to based on prior notions of defensibility*.  In this broad sense, we have not found any escape from speculation in one's life.  But some of them were wrong!  They literally have to have the capital allocation beat out of them, or they will steer us down their indefensible path.

First, there were several proposals.  We ended up with "opt-in" RBF.
RBF is not a *great* solution, because a great solution prevents double spending entirely while it allows instantaneous replaceable transactions, like Lightning Network does (but unfortunately, great solutions also have more simplicity than LN - we will probably merely call LN good enough, once we see it working).
RBF is a mini-payment-channel solution already allowed by current Bitcoin protocol, *and nobody knows how to outlaw or prevent it (or even conclusively determine when it was intentionally invoked by miners)* so adapting to it in a way that makes this clear, yet doesn't encourage vandalism, is good for everyone.

Sure, I support minimizing "economic change events", as long as we're on a plan that addresses the fee ecosystem in the long term (XT proponents believed they covered this last time around, although I found their reasoning lacking).
However, notice that we're now talking about what Jonathan &amp; Gavin have blessed as development methodology.  That's the change in power.  Why is that better than the discussion Bitcoin Core devs are having?


There was a more comprehensive presentation on the issue at Hong Kong.  Why is Gavin's commit better than the forthcoming work from that?


My earlier question here was whether this influences people towards validation as a centralized service.  One little tidbit of this discussion is that Bitcoin Classic actually is using code that expands to 8MB over time.  That's clearly going to have storage and bandwidth costs, and nudge people (those on the margin) **away from home validation, and into corporate services**.
More importantly, the scaling attitude here is basically that of XT, just truncated for the moment.  It's a safe assumption that this team will favor a return to that schedule, and disfavor work involving the Lightning Network, as they did when working under the XT brand.


Okay, when?  This gets back to what Gavin and Jonathan think is a priority.  This is the power grab that I'm continually highlighting in this thread.
@_date: 2016-01-19 03:59:05


Source repository has been made public.  ETA might take a while for the whole ecosystem to implement, but segwit and roadmap allow time and allow a blocksize hardfork in the meantime, if necessary.  LN team has been delivering well.  Cost of established channel operations should be extrememly low, since it's an open protocol and anyone can be a node.


People against RBF don't understand that it literally cannot be prevented by the protocol tools available in Bitcoin.  There is literally no reliable method to determine which transaction arrived first when two miners are sent different versions.  Blocks are what order transactions, not your mempool.  It's like special relativity that way.  The RBF code in Core both allows simple payment channels (not like LN's features, but they can reduce fees) and makes explicit to merchants existing limitations of the transaction ordering logic.  It does this as gently as possible, using an explicitly tagged feature identifier that merchants can detect and negotiate acceptance of.


The Core devs are capable of making the change in a safe manner.  As a group, they have made good judgements for years.

I didn't mean you'd lose privacy in LN, although there are some tradeoffs there, since your channel knows how much your pseudonymous identity spends.
In your initial scenario, you asked why not buy more bitcoins from an exchange to get them into the channel.  This requires verification.
If you already have access to bitcoins outside of an exchange, and you want to get them into some LN channel, then your other main alternative is to pick one and initiate an on-chain transaction.

Reasons to settle your LN channel, or create some other on-chain transaction:

* some other smart contract is required (which is ironic since mining advocates on 8btc have written against the smart contracts segwit would allow);
* an itermediate LN node went down, or your counterparty did not complete their side of the transaction;
* you don't want to trade personally-identifying information for access to your freely-held bitcoins;
* you are spending a coinbase transaction;
* you should only have a few LN channels open so that you can settle even if there's a massive spam flood; and

Segwit will work great on 2MB+ blocks, so it's more a matter of getting "lite node" features out into the ecosystem (by convincing wallet devs to rework their software) in a way that doesn't leave users locked into walled gardens of mere-SPV nodes.
Pooling centralization is already here, but that doesn't mean we've given up.  Again, focusing work on reducing unnecessary orphan blocks and experimenting with [weak blocks]( are both in the cards, to lessen the continued pressure for more pooling.  The area is one of active experimentation, and the approach is to be conservative until we understand it better.

We agree that anyone should be able to submit a transaction for a low fee, and that it should have good privacy features.  This is encouraging because it means we have technical differences, and - with sufficient evidence - should be able to converge on a least-risk plan that improves the system.


You should similarly hold your tongue for all other forseeable technical conequences then!  (/s - Of course I don't want you to do that.  I want you to be consistent about evaluating technical plans on their merits, and put in the energy to evaluate LN.)
Much of my anti-big-block argument rests on LN, so that's an unfortunate choice for you to ignore.
Some of my anti-big-block argument posits that **it's not about blocksize, but rather presenting enough convincing complications to excuse a power grab.  i.e. who controls the features that get merged**.  I like to keep this aspect front and center, in the current environment.
*edit:* explain convincing-enough complications

If you want to have the sliver of responsible discussion possible after all your name-calling, then tell us:
  * why you don't submit a BIP that convinces the developers - at a techical level - who are working so hard to get this right, and works within Core's roadmap (which, remember, actually mentions a hard fork explicitly, once features are in that make it safer to fork);
  * why you think 2MB blocks are safe before segwit helps take away a known validation DDoS attack (chewing CPU);
  * why you want to influence the ecosystem further away from personal validation (using the p2p protocol), and towards validation as a corporate service ...that the State can get its hands on;
  * why the same team that brought us the centralization risks of XT is the right team to offer "Classic";
  * whether this "Classic" team has agreed to **merge the Confidential Transactions feature, which is right now on the cusp of possibility (with segregated witness) and essential for our financial privacy**.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:24:10
I think we are both partly mistaken.  You're right that segwit nodes don't ask non-segwit nodes for blocks, and I'm wrong to say it's not a special setting to bridge non-segwit blocks.  However, segwit nodes do accept connections from non-segwit nodes and they do send non-segwit viewpoints of the blocks as well as non-segwit transactions, so that segwit nodes help non-segwit nodes not fork off.

The non-segwit fork would see that miners had mined blocks unlocking (oddly) the segwit output and assigning it to the P2PKH lockscript.  Although a nonstandard transaction, that won't be communicated between non-segwit peers, it's valid once mined.  That this old view of the blockchain is still valid, when viewed without the witness data, is what makes BIP9-activated segwit a soft fork, where you can upgrade or not at your leisure.
What this means to your question is that in the unlikely event of a feature reversion from segwit to non-segwit, only value sitting in segwit addresses would be at risk.  Value that had moved through segwit addresses and is currently sitting in P2PKH lockscripts would remain safely buried under proof of work.  If you never upgrade the addresses your wallet creates (or if you do upgrade but later downgrade your wallet and sweep all funds), then you are completely protected from the risk of miners downgrading.
*edit:* I didn't answer your question well (instead I answered your original claim about breaking fungibility), because you were asking about copying a transaction from one chain to another.  This depends on whether either sending address has been mixed with coinbase outputs since the fork.  Although nothing I wrote was wrong, shorter reply is more on point.

Here is the same thing (as far as taxation is concerned) happening with [Agilent in 2000](
**(IANAL) TL;DR:** Look at the percentage of your holdings allocated to the fork at the moment it is born, and allocate your original basis proportionally.  The birth of the spinoff does not constitute a change of ownership and is not an income event (which would be immediately taxable); instead you figure this capital gains stuff out when you sell and record the gain (or loss).
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:06:12


Wow, that phrase is sooo confused.
If you don't want segwit, then you don't upgrade your wallet and *you don't give the other party a segwit address*.  It's true you can't control how they sign their lockscript, but you do control whether you accept the proof of work that burys the transfer on whatever blockchain you're watching.

No, it's a massive centralization multiplier.  Anyone that doesn't have fiber to their house is out of the game.


That claim ignores the perfectly functional plans of you running a payment channel, which route transactions around the way we sustainably route Internet packets, rather than flooding them to everyone.  Core's acceptance of LN is based on the technical merits.


"democratization of transaction"... this is vague nonsense.  The whole point of the fight is to keep the network open for anyone to use.

Why do you buy the idea that valuation is a valid "divide and conquer" splitting point?  That is, why wouldn't proponents for the Bitcoin Core roadmap also want "future positive expectation", in the long run?  I believe everyone wants bitcoins to have immense value.
The XT/Classic argument was actually weaker than the one you're building support against (ahem; by ignoring historical in-bubble transaction rate and store payments in bitcoins, IMO).  The XT/Classic argument is that price needs to go up *while looking steady*.  The extra clause comes from fixating on a mistaken (fiat-centric) idea that money is [**only** a medium of exchange]( and nobody wants to use a medium of exchange that has speculative risks.  Money *is* a medium of exchange, but they're wrong because it is *also* a store of value.
Consider Gresham's Law.  Good money disappearing from circulation does not diminish its value; it's a sign that good money's store of value is intact.  Good money will rise as a medium of exchange once the legal regime loses its grip on forcing people to interact with the bad money - the debased currency.  Furthermore, the better the money, the less timing matters.  Good money has built-in protection from the corrosive chemistry (or is it politics) of time.
So how do we HODL to the moon?  How does that work?  It works a lot like bitcoins playing the same role gold does, in our society today.  You can't easily buy lunch with gold, but you know it's money.  Many other people believe that gold is money, and keep some.  There is a network that can connect these people with traders when they want fiat.  The exchange network functions well enough for traders.  More people buy in, and HODL.  The good money is *ready to circulate*, but people still prefer to spend what bad money comes their way.
Gradually, with wide adoption driving down volatility, and with homes reaching comfortable savings levels, it is natural that circulation will increase.  Here, Bitcoin's story about why it is better money does diverge from gold's.  Bitcoin, then, even during the period where its useful function is mostly store of value, must continue making progress on its story as a superior medium of exchange.  Fortunately, Bitcoin has the Lightning Network, poised to offer cheap and fast transactions rivalling credit cards, for everybody.  It doesn't have to survive on its use as a medium of exchange now, but it has to have good enough potential for peer-to-peer transactions so that its functions-of-money can balance out.   The specific failure event to avoid is confirmation illiquidity.  The way to avoid it is to enable segwit, in order to remove malleability, in order to allow LN.

Agree on all facts, but disinclined to support making it cheaper to expand the UTXO set until UTXO-pruning gets more support and code.  
[UTXO growth]( is still exponential.  (click "zoom out" 10 times, for a multi-year view.)
Custom miner fee policy would be interesting (in a kind of scary way), but miners have repeatedly said they don't want to own those decisions.  As a race to the bottom, we would also expect mining economics to subvert such policy.
Complicating Peter's idea, legacy use of nLocktime directly conflicts with rewriting transactions to include a proof.  I would support never pruning the legacy (current) UTXO set, and this makes my recommendation to keep it smaller, until new ideas are ready, more urgent.

Why wouldn't UTXO set growth respond to economic pressures, as fees rise?
In absolute terms, the cost of adding an extra UTXO is limited by (non-discounted) blocksize.  If (as a 2MB HF proposes) we double (non-discounted) blocksize, we cut in half this absolute cost of inclusion, relative to (SegWit-discounted) signature matter.
If (as SegWit currently implements) we do not halve the cost of including extra UTXOs, then their cost relative to the rest of the required (discounted) transaction data will increase.

I don't recall arguments that lower transaction fees are bad for usability and demand.  Instead, the specific XT/Classic proposals were problematic for starting on a slippery slope towards subverting mining fees, and reducing the security of the network by (marginally) forcing users into the hands of larger services capable of running nodes to validate their balance.
They can be right about growth in the short term, and still be wrong about the independence that makes Bitcoin valuable in the long term.


It happens gradually, whenever households using bitcoins for savings feel their savings are sufficient, and want to spend.  Some will simply rebalance their portfolio on an exchange, but this will reduce volatility, and will assist the transition as well.


They don't speak like that.  They want a better medium of exchange now (with associated new customer growth and merchant sign-up), and damn the consequences.  
It's not so difficult to see why XT/Classic proponents choose not to entertain the two-phase (first store of value, later medium of exchange) model that I've given you a story about.  I've certainly noticed how some of them profit from medium of exchange aspects, which pits them against HODLers.  It is a deep schism.

It is but one driver of several, and Bitcoin more urgently needs to keep proving its store of value, in this current phase.  That is another way of saying Bitcoin must remain independent, and bugfixes for maximum decentralization and security should come first.  We know that the story for Visa-scale transaction speed is there (LN), but operating on that part of the plan is less important than dealing with takeover threats.

Um.  Technically, what inflation and deflation are doing is shifting the point people are planning for.  
Inflation puts you in the here and now (forcing you to give up on any hope of savings), and deflation encourages a relatively higher savings rate (*but still bounded and achievable* - as anyone who has bought a depreciating tool like a computer knows).
So if you are taking a measurement *in this moment*, then you can steal from future available capital by stealing from the savings rate.  The cost is not measurable *in this moment*, because the cost is less capital available for investment in the future.  Remember, all savings is eventually spent.   Savings is spent as investments, when the returns look good enough.  It's not like savings - or proudly call it hoarding (HODLing) - is lost to the economy.  That's money working hard visibly sitting on the sidelines, asking for better investments!
Over the long term, shifting the portions of the pie that everyone gets does not increase available worthwhile capital.  We periodically relearn this when we share the pain of malinvestment made during the skewed wisdom of inflationary times.

If you click on "report", under any comment, you'll see a few things about how the system works: 






So when u/nullc was banned, it was because *in the judgement of r/btc users and moderators* he was doxxing someone.  After that, it escalated to reddit admins, who probably had a few moments to review it based on what they knew at the time.  At some point the user page said "temporarily suspended" (if I recall correctly), but that later settled to "account suspended" (which is what I was checking earlier), either by a timeout default or by action on the part of reddit admins.  Reddit admins now appear to have revised their stance, upon taking a closer look.  
Why is this significant?  I think it helps prove that r/btc is out to villainize and willing to apply the rules against him in a biased way.  This is no surprise to anyone paying the slightest bit of attention, but it helps to have clear events that can be explained without trying to get into the whole blocksize debate at once.  It's an ironic victory because r/btc is supposedly anti-censorship, and just lost a case about incorrectly censoring someone.

I think we're getting somewhere with this.  I can accept your caution regarding LN, if I believe that the path you're advocating does not interfere with LN's eventual success, or harm Bitcoin in the meantime.  


Well, do you care about crippling its security tradeoffs?  That is what people who advocate conservative blocksize care about.
I think you might care too (although in a way I disagree with) because you next say:


I am fairly certain this is wrong.  It's clear you mean user growth.  It's clear you mean several large institutions that maintain Bitcoin full nodes in datacenters, along with the miners.  Presumably you would hope that regulators look favorably upon these easily-regulated institutions.
Maybe you think that fiber is easy to get where you live, and is thus easy to get in enough parts of the world to solve Bitcoin's blocksize problems.  I disagree.  High bandwidth is not easy to get in a way that is not censorable, especially in the places where fiber doesn't reach.  Although other countries have more fiber, only the major metropolitan areas of the US are currently served with fiber.  We want Bitcoin to work for back-country areas, too.  We want people with money trapped under capital controls to have first-class access to their coins, not to need to trust an intermediary.  Bitcoin has to get through the firewalls, great and small.
We have been arguing about this growth path since the XT days, when my username was as fresh as a spring breeze.  In the time since, regulation has not been clearly favorable anywhere other than Switzerland (and arguably Japan).  Instead, the US IRS considers Coinbase.com's centralized resource as low-hanging fruit for finding people who haplessly use bitcoins like a currency, rather than as a capital gains investment.  Lawsky left NYDFS a minefield for NY Bitcoin startups.  The SEC forced the COIN ETF off to another exchange (BATS).  China is currently hands-off but everyone remembers the period of time when the major exchanges all stopped taking deposits.  None of these regulators are reliable allies.  Political allegiances are not sufficiently robust to depend on for a protocol change, no matter how many users are clamoring for relief from their governments.


If we are talking about sustainability, and voicing our understanding of the economic effects upon miners, then this becomes a very important point.  I'm glad it's the kind of thing you think about.  I disagree with your conclusion, and hope you'll hear my reasons.
It's fair to say that the basis of the LN-growth model is as follows: that miners will sustainably charge higher fees when an LN-aggregated Bitcoin transaction hits the chain, because it will aggregate thousands of Bitcoin transactions.  
There is some uncertainty in what the actual fees will be, but I am willing to let the market play that out, because this is the only solution that I can see that maintains decentralization where it matters on the underlying blockchain: at the ease of running a full node.
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:23:33


First, due to changes in the competitive landscape, there are always miners falling off.  We can only usefully interest ourselves in the net hashrate metric.
Miners have good subsidy for several more years, during the period in which we'll begin to measure *empirically* whether the added economic value going into each on-chain LN transaction allows miners to raise fees.  As the recent gigantic hashrate jump above 2PH/s shows, the most recent halving has certainly not slowed anything down.
As subsidy dwindles, it may be *the miners* who want a conservative block size, in order to get the most from LN's on-chain settlement transactions.  As fees again become crowded, miners can expect fees to keep their most efficient peers in operation.
@_date: 2016-11-28 19:54:42


Yes.  The Internet uses routed packets.  It seems to work okay.  That's what makes it decentralized.  Do you have a specific problem with routing proposals so far, to justify a belief that the problem cannot be solved similarly?


Do you have a technical reason to not want the experiment to continue as a layer-2 technology?  All you've said against it is that it's not finished.  We know it's not finished, but we think it is made out of robust pieces that can be arranged into the best possible solution.  Do you have any technical reason to disagree?


Bitcoin is currently in a conservative protocol-update mode making sure that full nodes don't get too expensive to run, which would be the primary force of centralization.  Do you think that the cost of maintaining full nodes matters?

This is a long conversation with Rodger Ver and credible experts (one each from coding, mining, and exchange) who are not Theymos and have not taken Blockstream money.  This is very encouraging because these are people who Rodger will still listen to, and they have a chance to invite Rodger to change his mind.
In the discussion, one of the things the group tries to explain to Rodger is that technical experts are still rejecting - as unsafe - every upgrade path they have yet seen that involves a hard fork, which of course includes the Bitcoin Unlimited plans.  There may be non-contentious hard forks in Bitcoin's future, once further groundwork is laid, but the SegWit soft fork plan is safer, has won the developer mindset required to code and test it, and is ready to go.

From a consequence-explanation basis, rather than tutorial experience, this is one of the best introductions to Bitcoin! Andreas covers a wide range of topics with complete grace and ease, and host Brian Rose has the financial background to ask excellent questions.  It's also nearly flawless production quality.
My only sigh of hearing misinformation was that I think he got the Ethereum story wrong.  Splitting the chain unintentionally (creating ETC) after the unforgiveable move to rollback transactions for political reasons is indeed a problem with *the ecosystem's* fundamentals.  Something about the Ethereum protocol, its reliance on an incomplete spec, the necessity of using fast-changing scripting languages, and the meetoo meaning behind its genesis block, were indeed involved in shitting the floor, there.   Who cares, if the chain is just a sandbox for devs; but for many people Ethereum was sold as a valuable commodity, and the (predictable) loss of value is creating bagholders.  Of course, it's understandable why he'd search for a shorter answer than the explanation required to explain all the details there to a TV audience, but that does not make his shorter answer more correct.  
I have long disagreed with Andreas about whether *bagholders create a zero-sum problem*!  So much so that I have to point out that (for an author) even the incentive of propping up one's book will cloud one's judgement.  I'm certain Andreas is speaking genuinely, but I hope his coming Ethereum book doesn't keep him from re-evaluating that position, in the fullness of time.

ValueShuffle is pretty awesome.  Section 2 on related work does a great job of explaining its relation to the other efforts in the space.  It looks highly complementary, and will make mix partners easier to find since the values involved don't need a common denominator.
We will still need TumbleBit's efforts, until CT activates and makes this possible.  CoinJoin is currently more deployed than TumbleBit, but it has a nagging problem with information asymmetry between makers and takers (i.e. it leaks), and TumbleBit's deployment readiness is fast changing.
One important aspect of CT, and a benefit to building upon it with this direction of work, is that everything is compatible with pruning.  This is good for a sustainable full node population!  
The technical difference of decent pruning will result in Bitcoin destroying Monero, in the long run.  It does mean, however, that the conversation about when we are ready to activate CT will get noisy, as there's currently well over $100M in Monero that will be fighting bagholding obsolescence.  
Zcash is also not prunable, so this will help Bitcoin crush that schism as well (at the price of yet more bagholder-investor noise in the CT activation discussion).
There's a lot to chew on here, and it's too early for me to be confident that there won't be other leaks of information while looking for mix partners (like is happening in CoinJoin right now), but I'm optimistic.

It does seem to be our exact difference.  I do want a money that
is "too good"!










Bitcoin has perfectly co-opted this attack.  Bitcoin opens its door to
all who wish a safe store of value.








You see here the reason this is a problem for government issued money
is that Nash sees no way to favor the issuer's goals.  He is not
saying that it is a problem for people who wish to preserve their
savings.  
Bitcoin has dissolved that problem by primarily aligning with the
goals of the hodler, yet unfailingly capturing transaction fees for
its security.  
Nash goes as far as to suggest that savings is not helpful to the
proper functioning of an economy.  This is a matter on which I and the
Austrians object wholeheartedly.  Savings is the source of all
sustainable investment, and the primary signal that interest rates
must move (higher) to incentivize further investment.












Here I believe we do agree; that in Bitcoin's deflationary economy eventually
lacking any inflation, there must be other per-transaction fee pressure to
secure the blockchain.  In this, Nash is quite prescient.






I think this fear assumes that price stability is a centralized
function.  In Bitcoin, we instead see that everyone is equally
exposed to the "hot money", and it burns many newcomers.
Eventually, however, the wisdom of hodling becomes clear, and
people realize that planning for volatility is their own
Bitcoin, by not trying to solve the problem, offers decentralized
price stability.
I do see now, however, what a sidechain-based price stability
group would look like.  It would be a bit like a Costco.com
membership, with store credit.  I can see how this is desirable,
even for a potato buyer like me.  I can see that many of these
offerings will blossom, each like a store concentrating on
different products.












This goal of helping borrowing in the currency's unit of account
has been abandoned by Bitcoin.  I think this is a good move, so
far, because we see along with it zero incentive for seriously
proposing the horrors of fractional reserve lending.  (That's not
to say there isn't any occurring now, but that exchange clients
would be appropriately outraged to hear of it.)  The Chicago Plan,
in the Great Depression, was the most serious attempt to put
American banking on a more sound footing, and it appears to have
been little more than a circulated letter.
Lending and borrowing in bitcoins will rely on derivatives and
smart contracts, built into the contract terms, to reduce exposure
to volatility.  This seems acceptable, as once the mechanisms are
well understood the market will put its own price on price

Miners are highly invested in complete hardware systems.  They are basically in the supercomputer-designing business.  They have to redesign their proof of work architecture if it needs to include ECDSA signatures.  The inefficiency of even a local round trip to a server to ask for the signatures would be intolerable (although it would be a penalty fairly applied to everyone at once, at first).  There would be an immediate race to redesign the ASICs, and the inevitable democratization of hashpower would be delayed.  In the short term, this would actually concentrate hashpower *more*.
However, the key distribution requirements *would* eventually be effective in changing the incentive to pool or not, and this *would* result in a more independent-thinking mining community.
*edit*: I didn't read your edit carefully.  In order for this to work, the signature has to be part of the hashed Merkle tree - changing the definition of the Proof of Work.  Otherwise mining pools just sign at the pool server, and there is no additional decentralization.

You asumed miners drop off in a way that affects hashrate, not I.  If you want to say that hashrate will suffer, you have to argue for it properly, not by attempting to put words in my mouth!
You're also trying to confuse the issue with LN, by falsely claiming that miners don't get any fees from it.  At some point channels open and close, and miners get those fees.  Thus, lightning will pay miner fees.  There are more aggregate transactions made per miner fee received; but arguably growth will be sufficient so that the extra value transferred in aggregate will be able to fund miners even better than they are funded now, using the fraction of LN transactions that do hit the blockchain.

Bitcoin is still primarily a store of value, though it has the technical potential (after improvements) to overtake several popular mediums of exchange (and that's important, too).  
Money is both a store of value and a medium of exchange.  Economists working for incentive-captured Academia have, over the past half century, downplayed the store of value [function of money]( Coincidentally, fiat does not provide it well, especially after the [Nixon shock](  Their thinking adapts with the political times: they [know which side their bread is buttered on](  But the signals from earlier times are clear.
As long as our hodling does not *interfere* with the potential to overtake Visa as a medium of exchange, then it's okay for us to think long term.  Although in countries with hyperinflation the need for merchants is more urgent, we do not need to artifically change our own behavior.  We need only a few marketplaces that accept bitcoins in altruistic demonstration of what will come (and we can be honest that the merchant story involves substantial trust until zero-confirm payments are solved by the Lightning Network).  We need only enjoy spending bitcoins after we have driven out excess fiat from our savings (which is us acting out [Gresham's Law](  In fact, by brave hodling (i.e. speculating, hoarding, saving), we actively show others the true worth of bitcoins, by keeping available supply low.  (As a side note, we also actively signal to investments in the economy that interest rates are not compelling to us in exchange for the potential of hodling, though the job to hear that signal is held by only a few old people sitting in boardrooms, and they dgaf because there are not enough of us, yet.)  It is natural for us to seek Bitcoin's superior value, and *our natural actions end up sending strong signals* to the market.  
If we needed only a medium of exchange, we would not care how many times Chancellor bailed out the banks.  As only an unregulated medium of exchange, sending to Wikileaks would leave the problem of which asset Wikileaks should register with a government (or, LOL, lug around) to hold the value.  Bitcoin is more, and it is good for us to act naturally to show this.

This topic of "upgrade pressure" is one of the major confusing claims by anti-segwit people (which do not include Mr. Sztorc), so the above consequences should be more fully explained.  
First off, Alice can get money from Carol without upgrading, whether or not Carol chooses to sign her balance over via segwit.  Alice hands Carol an old address, and Carol sends the money.  No problem. 
Second, Alice will know she has received the transaction once it is mined into a block.  Her software will tally it up correctly.
That means that Alice will only have the "loudness" of her software's incomplete assessment of Carol's segwit-signed offering during the zero-confirmation window.
Ideally, Carol would ask Alice whether the zero-confirm window is an issue, and whether Alice would like to see her input amount reduced by the mining fee Carol would have to pay to sign without segwit.  It's Alice's moral choice which of the following is the "noisier" externality: negotiating a higher mining fee with Carol, uncertainty during zero-confirm window, or working to upgrade.

Yes, I would agree.  But I haven't yet seen these points addressed, from my position as a hodler.  Maybe you have a page number to point me at?
Last I heard, inflation targetting was one of the routes to asymptotically ideal money.  The wikipedia page also mentions social welfare, without explaining how one decides which social welfare (so we can conclude politics).  I'm certain the goals of Ideal Money are not my goals if either of those features are included.

Petty to the economy pilots, but real to those of us with a stomach.
Gresham's Law doesn't hurt the people.  When they take a good out of circulation, they're adapting to pain inflicted by debased government money.  The people's hoarding saves their value.
Money has to circulate to know its value, but Bitcoin compensates for seldom being used in local payment (as long as one still has fiat money to spend) by trading internationally, so we do get constant reports of its price.  Bitcoin already survives every day as the deflationary currency, and its use is growing, proving this fear misguided.

The way the question is worded, Nick is answering, "*What do you hire Bitcoin to do for you, first and foremost?*"
Trace takes a couple minutes to set up the question, which is a bit longer than necessary, but in that context it's revealed that Nick is answering exactly your question as well.  
He is saying that *globally seamless and decentralized-by-design security* are the things that people come to Bitcoin for *first*.  I would call this a description of what makes property *truly yours*.   
In your wording, these are the things otherwise unsolved in society.  Nick is explaining that these will continue to be the features most important for Bitcoin to solve, to maintain relevance.  
I think BitcoinCore understands these priorities.  When the developers put work into a soft fork rather than a hard fork, and design SegWit's UTXO incentives to slow the growth of resource requirements for full nodes, it's because they believe their true customers are not trying to recreate PayPal or Venmo in the hopes of starting a political grassroots campaign for tolerance.  Political surprises that flip the other way are too easy to engineer...  Instead, the technology has always been stronger than any political mindset, and it needs to grow in a way that does not lose this.  After gaining a stronger (non-political) technical foothold, we'll grow by layering on protocols that can out-innovate the existing services; just like the Internet does.  But first, we all feel an incredible untapped need for the security of something that is truly yours.  I think Bitcoin and BitcoinCore have always been intending to work towards that honey badger relevance.

Smaller share... of profit!  ...When measured against the marginal cost of producing the extra watts.
The losers here are the less efficient miners, at home, paying retail for electricity (if they're not already using it to heat their home in winter).
The world gets globally efficient use of baseload power, and Bitcoin gets globally efficient hashrate security.  Good deal!
Also, higher hashrate means the price goes up as long as there are baseload power producers who are yet to discover their new business model arbitrage.  (Because all investment into Bitcoin mining eventually affects the price, by forcing latecomers to buy instead of cheaply mine.)  That dynamic could play out as a strong driver for several decades.

So you outlaw indentured servitude yet the scheme allows p2pool cooperation.  The costs: hardfork, mining hardware must include ECDSA signing, key distribution logic is required in mining software, endpoint security becomes an issue, and 137 extra bytes (public key plus signature) are required to verify the block.
P2pool could handle this in principle, but would need much more attention to the codebase in practice.  I think you can also imagine the politics involved.

I admit to overstating how node count would reduce.  It is indeed
possible that node count could increase if enough users were coming
onboard.  If I want to challenge that part of your argument, then I
should require you to explain how many users can use Bitcoin (as you
think it needs to be used), before the blocksize would need to be
doubled again.
It is also true that heavier node resource requirements would push
more people away from running their own nodes, controlling their own
private keys, and connecting using robust peer-to-peer clients.  We
would see more of the risky SPV clients, and users would be more likely to
use web wallets, and see their power as the economic majority handed
to the person running their website.  This is a definite security
risk.  It is more important to me than the absolute node count.














You have some good points here, and I do think this is the key point.
But I don't think we agree.  I don't want to engineer for the hope of
winning an argument based on the unfavorable political image of
persecuting Bitcoiners.
I don't want to rely on political feelings at all.  If a political
fight comes, and Bitcoin is outlawed, I want to win it the way the
resistance always wins: inevitability.  Bitcoin is inevitable because
it cannot be killed.  It cannot be killed because there is no way to
find and shut down all the nodes.  I do not want to make Bitcoin nodes
easier to control, in the hopes of entering a political argument with more users on my side.  I would rather have more independent full nodes than have more users.  


I think this is a variant of the "*government will shut down Bitcoin,
so we must work with government*" argument.  It is an important thing
to make a decision on.  I have made the decision that working with
government does not help Bitcoin.
Let's analyze whether it would succeed, for someone to pay to incentivize Know Your Miner (KYM)...  
* The first thing
miners could do is lie about the identity of the block winner.  If
they get away with it, they get your extra reward.  If they are
caught, then they still get the normal block reward.  It looks like
they should try to lie every time.  If they are worried about getting
caught, then you are actually claiming that they do not care about the
reward, because they will comply out of the fear of getting caught.
* The second thing miners would do is allow anonymous pooling, where the
pool miners can actually choose the transactions.  A pool developer
would say, "Yes, take my identity, I want the extra reward."  But then
they would have thousands of home miners connect to them.  Mining
pools are capable of allowing miners to pick the transactions for the
block they solve: p2pool [already allows
* The third thing that would happen is there would be a different
hashrate for KYM transaction rules and uncensored transactions.  This
would be a disaster and so the developers would change the block
verification algorithm so that transactions must be committed into a
block either before they are validated, or selected from coordinated
versions of the mempool in a deterministic way.  In short, the
developers would route around the censorship.
* The fourth thing that could happen is Bitcoin could starve for a year
with low hashrate, while the developers fixed up a MimbleWimble
sidechain and bet everything on it.  Whether or not KYM was still in
effect (for miners that could be found), transactions would then
* The fifth thing that would happen is miners would learn to hide.  They
are already [hiding in








Growth is important in the long run, but the security of independent
nodes and independently-verified wallets is more reliable to engineer
than political favors.

I understand this interest, but it seems closely tied to the economist's dream of flying the economic airplane.  My intuition says that I, as a hodler, am better off focusing on store-of-value (with a reasonably capable medium-of-exchange that can be improved over time), and letting stability emerge in the distant future.  In other words, I'm better off with fixed issuance and taking the volatility as it comes.
You see, whenever the money has to change to balance some aggregate thing, then what the money issuers are saying is that - due to some change in the average supply/demand for wheat, coal, steel, widgets, and whatnots - my previously paid hour of labor's value has changed, and is now valued at Y instead of X.  If I had been working to buy potatoes, and my money is being diluted to compensate for the extra "value" in "my economy" from a bumper crop of wheat, then I do not feel better off.  That doesn't help me buy my potatoes.  
So the maximization in this economic setting is some utilitarian average, but I know that if I want what is commonly measured I will do better, and if I want what is not commonly measured I will do worse.
The point is that all economists are pushing the bubble of subjective value out to some edge or another, but if that's the edge I'm on, then I'm going to face it anyway.
I think the counterpoint *for price stability and against any single measure attempting independence* is that market participants try to corner the market.  This must be why Nash ruled out gold (although I could use a more historically accurate answer regarding his thoughts on gold).  Nash's thesis then is that the more industrially-determined the commodities are, the less of this form of manipulation we'll see.   Nash, AFAICT, is saying that Yes nobody uses the products of the economy in an average way, and Yes they can't be measured correctly, but this industrial use idea gets us as close as possible to minimal disturbances.
Understanding all that, a volatile deflationary store-of-value still seems better for me, the hodler.


I'm not convinced on this point, which I think I captured in the "some edge or another" discussion, above.
Expanding on that a bit, it's not such a big deal that the price of copper is corrupted when Chinese pig farmers start hoarding it (a story from 2009).  Instead, the issue is that I pay for society's ever-growing interest in copper whether or not I think digging it up is a mortal sin against the Earth.  If we think of oil instead, this leads us right back to the petrodollar that we're trying to get rid of.


I do accept the wisdom of the market, here.  I accept that whether I use an industrial basket or a single digital commodity, I must communicate with others to know their prices.  I see that as a fairly weighty responsibility, and I expect to have to do the work to translate prices accordingly.


If I understand correctly, you're saying that Ideal Money would be the best measure of the relative prices of all existing currencies, whether fiat or cryptocurrency.  This does sound like a valuable service, but I wouldn't want to sell my bitcoins to hold ideal money during Bitcoin's growth phase (which should last until global adoption is maxed out).
Can the Ideal Money index be back-calculated from existing commodity prices?  If it can, is having the index enough, without having the actual currency to trade?  As I recall, one of the functions of Ideal Money (as Hayek conceived it) was as a vote of no-confidence for fiat currencies.  We already have Bitcoin as that vote of no-confidence.  What more do we need from Ideal Money now, other than a relative measure (one more accurate than Bitcoin) for the moneys of the world?

This is brilliant.  I'm forced to completely rewrite my RES tag for you.  :)  I hope you tackle the routing details with similar vigor, as I think you'll see it's essentially adapting well-known Internet routing ideas.
  * You actually could use a Trezor/Ledger to sign your LN node's hot-wallet requests, if you set up a way to delay while prompting your mobile device.  That takes away even more risk.  One consequence would be that your node is less desirable for routing other people's transactions.  Whether this matters to you depends on your personal risk/reward ratio, and whether you are connected enough to possiby earn substantial LN fees if you can sign transactions quickly.  Another consequence could occur when you're unexpectedly offline, for a few days at a time, while at the same time someone tries to close your channel with a prior balance.  But, since you probably know when you're going to be offline for a while, you can spin up a regular (no Trezor/Ledger) hot wallet to cover for you during that time.
  * As you explain near the end, false signing, after an online hack, is one kind of stealing. Since online wallet hacks that allow it are a significant threat in our online world (although they can also be mitigated if LN nodes use hardware signing, as above), you may want to find some way to work that distinction in higher up, where you explain that stealing based on knowledge of the receipts is not possible.
  * The forfeiture of channel funds scenario would be more compelling if it occured when only $50 of the channel was assigned to the store owner, because then there is an actual $50 loss for the cheater.

The fees go down if space is plentiful.  It's in their self interest to get more **users** into Bitcoin, and paying fees on transactions.
The only way to get fees with huge blocks after subsidy goes down is to cosy up to exchanges and ask for handouts, or shut off your hashrate.

One reason reviews seem lacking is that the kind of review that BIP 148 needs is new.  The code is trivial (or almost-trivial, since there was indeed a bug).  The more dangerous element than the existing code is the process of the economic majority picking it up.
That's complicated, but there is no guidance available for economic-majority-UASF anywhere.  The idea, and the approach to implementing it, can still have merit while not meeting your prior pattern for good deployment.  Do not let the unreviewable part block the code that is there to review.  If specific ideas about how deployment could be improved come forward, they will be heard.
One thing that Greg did not explain in his post is exactly which other deployment idea seemed better, and how using another BIP9 bit is any different.  If another BIP9 bit is used, then why does he think that old clients will recognize it as a valid segwit deployment?  In fact, if the installed base using BIP9's-bit-1 is ignored, then there will be a **larger** problem with legacy users, not a smaller one.

No, there isn't a significant opportunity cost.  Devs are fixing the protocol so that the transaction doesn't need to be resent in the block, to communicate what the block is.  Which is indeed why I assume the fees will go to zero with huge blocks.
Nobody is asking people to pay thousands of dollars to transact on-chain.  Miners will get reasonable fees for a blocksize that isn't so big that it crowds nodes out, and people will use... Lightning!  They will *want* to use Lightning because it reduces their fees.

Okay, maybe you think financial independence is not the "far out, ridiculous, and ignorant" part.  It's really hard to tell, at this level of hyperbole.
If financial independence is not the part that sets you off, then what's wrong with concluding some protocol rules support it more than others?


The rules for my government were created by people who believed that governments turn on their people.  My government is currently working to create a legal and technological precedent for demanding that no digital thoughts or communication can ever be fully private.  It seems pretty clear that concluding that governments turn on their people is a very defensible stance earned from an informed reading of history and current events.
You don't need to use hyperbole and anger to try to be different from people who you fear will be persecuted at some later time.  You can want good technical features, and say what they are.

Issues  and  are both the same, summarized as "Hard forks set a higher bar for changing bitcoin’s economic policies ", it's a weak reason, given that the segwit plan achieves known objectives and doesn't preclude more automatic settings once the landscape is better known.

This question is important because the multi-exchange agreement written to deal with BU's threat of forking was clear that forks should have replay protection.  
I think UASF will not, and here's why: it's not a hard fork, so the other chain will cease to exist once the UASF chain is longer.  Replay protection that preserved the fork would prevent the UASF goal of activating segwit for one and all.
I also think this means there will be zero non-speculative transactions occuring on the chain, until it is the longer chain.  
I realize this is not a completely compelling answer.  This answer is the best I know how to do right now.  It's yet more reasoning that depends on knowing that the chain will succeed in the end.  That is the continual task that falls to the exchanges who will make or break this idea.

Does decentralization add value to bitcoins in your eyes, beyond its necessity in enforcing the 21M coins limit?
@_date: 2016-02-01 23:16:26
Because expensive nodes attached to expensive mining rigs isn't a solution to the decentralization problems in either mining or verification.  The mining decentralization problem is well known: p2pool has disadvantages so the other pools get bigger and bigger.  The verification decentralization problem is whether you, as a user, find it cheap and simple enough to use p2p protocols to verify your own bitcoin ownership, rather than handing your economic power to a centralizing business service.
Segregated Witness already introduces a "lite node" that allows the class of lite nodes to rely on each other.  It's not a full node but it's better than the total trust in full nodes that SPV requires.  Segwit largely shifted the problem from whether full nodes were easy to maintain, to how the mutually-supportive "lite node" infrastructure will develop.  We'll see that over time.  In a segwit-deployed world, the next critical infrastructure fix is to resolve the reasons that rational miners join the largest pools, such as minimizing their orphan rate.

I would ask them about what property they're willing to honor, find out what laws they'd support to reduce economic rent, and get a sense of whether they're in support of anything coercive.

The things you're saying about shifting effort aren't wrong (although see Greg's recent response about defeating this scheme), it's just that I don't regard the (very poorly named) "SPV mining" as one of the important problems connected to node decentralization.  
How many nodes do you need on the network?  The best answer is: *one* - the one *you* use.  
It takes a shift in understanding to get to that point, after hearing the long fight about how blocksize affects the "health" of the network in terms of number of validating nodes.  That conversation wasn't wrong; it was just a roundabout way of measuring who was taking the effort to secure themselves, and rightly worrying that the costs to do so were increasing.

If the economic majority won't eventually win, then it will be bad.  But if the economic majority causes the miner to earn more for supporting segwit, then their non-signalling fork will be temporary.  Since non-UASF full nodes will follow the longest chain with compatible rules, they will not be stuck on a dead chain (as they would be on a true hard fork).  
Temporary contention from a UASF is not the same problem as an unsafe hard fork.
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:04:30

Yes in the practical aggregate, but No not by necessity.
First, to the degree that bitcoins are used to avoid sending fees into the financial sector, or used to minimize the harm that governments can do, everybody can win.
Second, if you look at how fiat money is issued and used, there is a lot of control involved.  That has significant negative value to some people.  These costs are [never labeled in aggregate metrics]( but individuals avoiding them find another source of net value gain.
Third, it is also possible to gain real value from a hedge, even if the hedge position costs money and is not activated.
While these are possible factors, there is a lot of speculative trading going on, so we can expect that most capital losses are viewed plainly as such.  
Finally, each exposure of a price preference, via a trade providing liquidity, is another "unseen" gain to all future participants.

I found his statement about dictators myopic, because dictators already have access to national banking systems, so they do not need bitcoins.  Dictators also do not have anywhere near as much wealth as the collective millions of people in free countries who want to truly own their savings.

It's a difficult question to understand, due to the counterfactual assumptions required.
* if I couldn't understand abstract proposals, and could only think ahead when I saw running code
* if the future risk from BIP101 infrastructure effects looked less scary than the present risk of fees inconveniencing users during full block scenarios
* if I made the political judgement that customers demanding an easing of regulator interference would be more effective than retaining the technical capacity to resist censorship of regulators in the first place; and thus accepted the idea of sacrificing some technical independence for the easiest growth possible
* if I sensed that cheap and plentiful transactions were more critical to Bitcoin's long term value proposition than its role as an unassailable store of value 
* if all possible payment channel solutions (including Lightning Network) were going to ruin decentralization and privacy, so that the only way to get cheap and plentiful transactions would be via much larger blocks
* if the untapped charity instincts of most households could easily cover the cost of maintaining bandwidth and computation for nodes required to receive and process every transaction on the network
* if datacenters were not easily regulated entities, and were capable of standing up for censorship resistance without risking their entire business getting shut down; and I thus didn't care at all how many households ran full validating nodes
* if I agreed with the statements of BIP101's benevolent dictator that gradual innovation through sidechains sounded like an unnecessary methodology, offering more unnecessary innovations, and that Satoshi's understanding couldn't be improved on
...then I too would support BIP101.

The question in its entirety is worth a listen, as Trace explains what he thinks is important, and what he's asking about priorities.  Nick's answer is short and direct:


its decentralized security (its integrity, its censorship
resistance), and that makes it independent of financial institutions -
which the rest of the financial payments world is not - and it makes
it globally seamless (crossing borders seamlessly), so I would say
those would be your highest priority; because those are the
distinguishing factors that distinguish Bitcoin from Visa and the
other traditional systems.  Those would be your highest priority

This is absolutely wrong.  That is not how soft forks operate.  This is a question of basic SegWit mechanics that we have been correcting each other on for over a year. 
Non-upgraded nodes will not need to "accept" SegWit transactions, because their wallets will not generate SegWit addresses.

You didn't invent Bitcoin because you would have asked for permission first, and they would have said no (as they did, many times).
Now that somebody(s) wiser than you saw the historical need and studied enough to take the power into their own hands to make Bitcoin exist, you've already forgotten the work they went though.  You'll be on the big-blocks side of the scaling argument, becuase you think centralization in datacenters isn't much of a worry.  You can't imagine what a (local) Internet takeover-by-selective-censorship would entail, so you feel safe that it will never happen.

[I argue here](that these are implicit assumptions for current vocal supporters of the idea of BIP 148.  These people may also eventually morph into actual BIP 148 consensus enforcers, dropping blocks that do not comply.  
If overwhelming community support is possible, then there must be a way to get there.  It means that the "rules" are not real at first, otherwise nobody could reach the consensus point for the exact reasons you state.

It's wrong to overfocus on mining nodes.  Only the economic majority of validating nodes can limit miners' arbitrary changes of consensus rules (i.e. unwanted hard forks).

Bitcoin can be the base layer for everybody, whether or not some people access it via layer-2.  
At the $500 savings level, there may be different education risks, and someone may trust the smart kid in town to help them set up a node with fixed disk and bandwith costs (a really smart kid might run a neighborhod WIFI network).  
At the $50 savings level, one may point to a local Electrum-SPV node and open a channel on the Lighning Network, both run by someone who they have some recourse with, should network partitioning or technical misunderstanding lead to problems.  These risks are decentralized personal choices, and different from protocol changes that march towards centralization.
"Everybody" might not seem to answer your question (because technology gets better over time, so targeting questions have to be located in a specific time and place), but it points the way for another question you should ask: *is there some path of customer aquisition that dead-ends*, before everybody has the option to use bitcoins?
The answer to this is that settling for German-tech-level node costs will, with normal storage and bandwidth growth predictions, definitely leave Turkey and Mozambique out, but we can still improve things for German-tech-level users at a rapid pace, with the list of innovations that do not make the eventual story worse for Turkey and Mozambique.
The base layer should be simple and universal.  This is obvious to technical users, but not everybody.

You can definitely select your first node, and quite likely several others along the way.
Intermediate nodes only know that a certain value was transferred from-and-to their direct connections using the hashed secret "R".
However, an attacker with two nodes on the network trivially knows when the same microtransaction is transitting across attacker nodes, because both use the same "R".

    continue to use it illegally:

    and stopping cybercrime, the IOCTA advised that **laws will not be

      industry to cooperate with law enforcement, there is **greater
      benefit in establishing and building working relationships** in

All I would add is that complying and "being at a disadvantage" means putting up with the financial sector fees that we experience today.

This has to be reworded to be correct.  If the UASF chain is eventually the longest chain, then the old node will have followed an orphan branch for as long as it exists, despite switching over to the longest chain once it destroys the orphan branch.  It is during this time when the UASF might be the shorter chain that the old node could see transactions that will later be erased (especially if the split has lasted more than 100 blocks).

No, their alliance is explained by the expectation that they will have more control of mining on the old chain, because they get ASICBOOST distributions from BitMain.
Their plan is to strangle Bitcoin's features so that their ASICBOOST trick keeps working, and get as many bitcoins as possible, while pumping altcoins, then let Bitcoin move on to SegWit and ride its rising market, too.

Though [no collisions have ever been found]( seeing a SHA256 hash of one thing doesn't tell you that the same value "CANNOT" be a hash of another thing.  In fact, the infinite set of all documents requiring storage larger than 256 bits is guaranteed to have infinite collisions.

Yes, my statement was poorly worded.  It's better to highlight that flooding all transactions to all nodes has ridiculously poor scaling characteristics.


The topology of LN can be as bad as hub-and-spoke, but it can be as good as a decentralized mesh.  There's work to be done to give it the right topology.


KYC threats assume centralization, and can be prevented with decentralization.  Payment history can be avoided with anonymous aggregation of payments between LN nodes, so that you only need to trust that one node in your chain is honest.  Also, you can use a LN node run by the seller you're buying from, so that you leak information to a party that already has that information.
As for the others, if the technology layer exists, people will work on it.




You've helped me see that regulatory pressure against LN will be of a different sort than pressure against miners.  Miners will get all the pressure to censor, while LN nodes will get pressure to keep logs.  If LN turns into a Tor network, with lots of onion routing, this should be solvable at a technical level.
IOW, the risk of censorship has a worse mitigation outlook than the risk of LN node logging.


Okay, I'd need you to show me what assumptions you're using to see that LN nodes can only be big nodes, because I'm not getting that.  I assume profitability will follow usefulness.  If you're worried that small operators will not join the fray, then we can make LN node participation easy to run alongside any full node, drawing on the collective desire for privacy and decentralization.

Nobody is blaming the hardworking American interns who keep the show going, or even the true believers who end up in its priesthood.  We are all questioning belief in the institution itself, and its faith driven formulas for making our lives better.  It's true: we never seem to remember why handouts to other people make our lives better than handouts to us.  Why doesn't the reeducation work on us?
Our vision is not myopically set on what to do with laws the way they are now.  Our timeline is broad.  We haven't picked this viewpoint, but are forced into it by our personal horror stories -- which you see every day here -- about people forced to look for alternatives after injustices trying to use the legacy fiat banking system, even in its newer "fintech" incarnations.  This matters because these events change who we are in a way that isn't temporary.
What is the viewpoint?  Inflationary paper money is not a new idea, the founders were not stupid about what they wrote in the US Constitution about coinage, and the US is on its *third* central bank for a reason.  
We are noticing that IOER is a multi-decade handout.  We don't think the emergency bailouts are going to strengthen a system that improves our lives, but have rather encouraged more regulatory capture.  
We don't want to save the world with formulaic interest rate manipulation, we want our savings to survive and we want freedom when we spend.  We are dropping out so that the formulas don't marshall us to the commands of some *Economist Generalissimo*.  
Some of us are trading to make a lot of "money" (measured in fiat), but most of us just save, which we call hodling.  The real opportunity here is paid for in attention; a viewpoint we're sharing: incorporating this economic blasphemy.
**TL;DR:** You don't need any priesthood. 
P.S.  Basic income will be great for a while.  Since consumption will change drastically, it will drive asset bubbles.   This will create further inequality, which will require more redistribution -- a feedback loop -- which will be cured with high taxes.  Higher taxes mean a larger percentage of the economy under government rules.  When the US government controls the economy it becomes more totalitarian, because nobody trusts the US government and the US government does not trust its citizens.  This is all fundamentally central planning, but basic income tries to short-circuit the stupidity of planning by funnelling all of it into redistribution politics.  That will get quite hot.  In case you haven't noticed, the free variable even under a successful totalitarian redistribution system that destroys the inherent inequality of asset ownership is the value of USD.  Work it out, and you have another reason to buy bitcoins.

Well, back to UASF (BIP 148) for simple SegWit!  
This proposal changed the activation bit (SegWit uses bit  which means that all nodes have to upgrade to make use of it.  Currently deployed software will never believe that SegWit has activated, even if something does activate on this other bit.
Before running software supporting this proposal, users will have to face the issue about whether the attachment of a rushed hard fork is a good idea.  Devs repeat over and over again that if they did feel a hard fork to increase blocksize was necessary, they would want to see the empirical data from SegWit's adjustments to block size, work more with both activation logic and the new SegWit scripting improvements to reduce risk, and give any hard fork code about a year to filter into the ecosystem.  Every reasonable technical person will be against this, and see it as more [horse trading](  
The exchanges will not pick it up, for the same reason they didn't pick up BU: it's easy to explain how it's shit, to anyone who will listen.  It probably won't get merged into core.
Think about that last part: nobody wants to merge this into Bitcoin Core, even as an option.  A reckless hard fork is quite dangerous.  But yesterday there was discussion about merging BIP 148 as a user option.  This proposal will try to demand equal mindshare with that one to get merged as a user option.  What is the purpose here?  It is to put a poison pill into merging BIP 148 into Bitcoin Core as a user option.  
The market has this completely backwards.  Get excited about BIP 148 instead.

* No soft fork will allow more than 21M bitcoins.  
* Soft forks rely on a sustained 51% agreement by miners.  Even a momentary slip below 50% of mining would allow the old rules into the blockchain, if most full validating nodes supported old rules.
* The greatest danger in a soft fork is that the rule change might advantage incumbant miners in order to make recovery difficult.  Fortunately, it's a hard fork to make a feature change to block size, which could (taken to its extreme) advantage miners with datacenter-level bandwith connections.
I don't know that there aren't soft forks that could advantage incumbant miners, but I'm thankful that the possible skews to who wins at the mining game - that I currently know about - do require a hard fork.

Two years into this planned AT&amp;T rollout, I expect everybody will be rebuilding blocks mostly from prior-seen transactions, similar to how the miner relay network works now.
Node bandwith still requires enough download speed to receive the transactions, and enough upload speed to retransmit them to a respectable number of peers.  But it's an obvious mission of the protocol team to make block discovery a non-event (unless miners find incentives to include lots of their own transactions).

It's not the first time BTCUSD appreciation has exceeded its long-term exponential trend.  
I see the price as a few months ahead of itself.  Not a big deal yet, but yes there is some air in the water.
One scenario from here would be if we were to go sideways for the summer, instead of up too fast and then a plunge that would scare the newbies.

Another attack is much simpler.  If Satoshi is this guy, and if he has his keys (and could have them stolen or get extorted), then there may be another 1M bitcoins released at any moment.  That is more coins than will be released in the 52 weeks following the halving.  Satoshi's coins could be Bitcoin's kill switch, if they still exist.
One consequence of a successful price attack at halving is that some of the dire miner fallout predictions could actually happen.  Get ready for a weird summer.

I would say it's the simplist, but it's not the only way.  We have a decentralized Internet passing packets back and forth with many imperfections, but with enough software on top to get our communications through.  Cryptography is our main tool for neutrality.
Understanding alternatives to flooding, that rely on what are essentially routing protocols, can get complicated.  Imagine if you're trying to sell someone a bitcoin and you have to explain to them that it's real money becuase something akin to [BGP]( will get their payment through, on the day they want to sell it on.
*Eek!*  But that's exactly the conversation we're in, with onion routing code up there at the top of the thread.
Fortunately, once the code is running, you don't have to explain to a potential bitcoin buyer yourself, for the same reason that I can't assume you know BGP: it just works.  
Routing seems like a bad complexity cost, but it's an absolutely necessary cost that the system **will** have to pay, someday (due to scaling limits of flooding).  I'm really surprised that you'd be willing to forgo growth at the upper limits of Bitcoin's potential.


I agree there could be another point of regulatory attack, if LN nodes (note that I'm never calling them hubs, which i think is a horrible name) are not decentralized.  However, if LN nodes are as common as full validation nodes, then the attack is as difficult as trying to regulate passing on a p2p message, just like full nodes do with every transaction they receive now.


I think that's correct, if you use LN the wrong way.  Don't send everything through one channel.  Pick routes that are encrypted, obsfucated, and onionized.  Prefer channels that already know your payment history, because a merchant is shipping to your address and that can't be prevented.
My accepting the risk you're focusing on, and my expectation of enganging all these mitigations, seem worthwhile to me only because **there is no mitigation whatsoever to 51% miner censorship**.  It's not that I'm denying the importance of LN privacy issues; it's that centralized mining is the worst possible case for Bitcoin.
Now, typically when this point comes up people point fingers at the Chinese miners and laugh about how centralized mining already is, as if I shouldn't care.  I do care about that, and I do want to have an opportunity to fix it; as people discover Bitcoin, and hardware manufacturers help get simple set-top boxes into people's homes.
So my viewpoint requires both a careful sorting of risks, and optimism that *as long as the network rules promote some decentralization* we will be able to advance the software and hardware ecosystem along to achieve it.


Well, I think with the right layer at the bottom, much can be achieved in upper protocol layers.

That's a good question!  
Perhaps thinks peace with miners has real benefit, such as reducing their desire to pump altcoins, and is worth the attrition from doubling the network cost of peer-to-peer operations (pushing people further out of running their own nodes, and further into web services like Coinbase.com, which pegged its rising star on Ethereum).  
Perhaps he is more comfortable with technical solutions on the horizon for SegWit-enabled "lite nodes": sharding the work of verifying transactions in blocks, [by accepting "fraud proofs"](
Perhaps he sees exponential UTXO set growth as a problem that we will find some [other technical solution](for.

The problem with Mycelium is that they ripped everybody off in a crowsale and their platform leaks information to the network.  There's a good one-paragraph bash on them in [this article](Also it's SPV, so safety totally depends on what version of Bitcoin the remote server is running.
If you don't transact until you're sure that other people using SPV wallets like Mycelium are safe, then you'll be fine.  You do hold the seed words, after all.
@_date: 2016-07-05 22:52:02


We'll need an opcode for that, so LN smart contracts can implement it.

It was specifically talking about the interest, at 5:30.  It's an often repeated story, based on a simple formula, but incorrect.  When the banker buys *your* services, their profit can be reused to pay interest.

Does the SEC need specific cause to deny the self-regulatory rulemaking body their self-regulated rule change?
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:39:11
It's locale-specific.  
You would do well to select Canadian counterparties and use Interac.  In Europe, it would be SEPA.  Some US banks have instant transfers within the same bank, and some allow cash deposits to personal accounts.  Elsewhere, OKPay might be best.
*edit*: I don't know if the system filters arbitrators intelligently, but you'll want to select an arbitrator that understands the limitations of your payment system, as well.

You're listening carefully and have excellent arguments.
In the realm of persuasion with a captive audience, where you have time for a one-two logical punch and where body language can keep you from losing touch, mirror their absurd beliefs with a hyperbolic twist, until they instinctively step back for balance, and offer the problem you want to solve.  
This is a slightly narrowed version of psychology's mirroring empathy tactic, and it creates room for a change in perspective.  If you are sarcastic or unconvincing, they will sense an attack and keep backing into their default ideological corner (losing any chance of a change in perspective), or accuse your intuition pumps of straw man heritage.
Your goal in every conversation should not be to change anyone, but to find out where your argument (or our product) was insufficient enough to leave them stuck.  ...stuck on a path that they will set aside for now, but surely progress further down some other day in the future.
Often I leave Bitcoin out for a long time, preferring to talk through the fundamentals using gold.  People may not understand its use as money any better, but at least it doesn't threaten their competence with its depth of technical innovation.
The "inflation good" argument only works its confusions in the abstract.  You can offer to sell an imaginary hedge of some sort, to get things back down to the concrete, where people can think about prices in their lives, rather than symbols in a formula.

Neither CTLV nor CSV can extend the reach of an expiring contract (only) during a fee pressure attack, although every contract writer would agree that the contract should extend.  
The proper opcode should either allow awareness of median fee per kilobyte, over prescribed time intervals, or define some "abrupt congestion metric".  The former is the more flexible solution, but requires some foreknowlege of how reasonable fees might vary at the time the contract expires, and any math formula will cost bytes in the contract.  The latter would be an arbitrary knob in the code, that people would fight over, but would be terse.
CTLV and CSV *do allow* one to specify long-enough expiry periods that it would be impossily expensive to sustain an attack through an entire LN dispute period (i.e. once R is revealed), so you are right that they affect the issue, however this tradeoff directly affects (worst case) settlement times.

What a liar.  He's omitting that he later sold out.
The whole piece was designed to instill authority so that he would sound better as he takes a shot at Blockstream (in another lie about who controls Bitcoin) for technical decisions which Falkvinge is totally incompetent at judging.  That stupid attempt at authority would sound even stupider if Falkvinge was telling you the full story about how weak his trust is, in his own predictions.
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:06:31
You're right, I was in a different context.  
I do think an opcode allowing fee pressure introspection is better, because it doesn't try to change time.
