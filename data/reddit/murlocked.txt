Thank you very much for your interest in my game!  
Since there are quite a few people wanting to check the game, here is the link:
 [Table Dragon AR - Google Play](   
But to be honest the game is not that great. It was more like a tech demo (ar with gif "meme" generator).  Bitcoin integration is not even there anymore (it was against Google Play policies).

I have much more joy from the fact that someone was willing to donate relatively big amount of money for something I created, than from the money itself.

Yeah, that was the idea. Unfortunately, it is against Google Play policies so I had to remove it today :-/

The implementation is actually really simple. There is just an address with a copy button + the game uses [BlockCypher.com]( API to get the total amount of BTC ever received by that address. I then use that value to lower the chance to show ad.

It is against their policy to ask for donations of any kind if you are not a registered non profit. All "donations" should be done via google billing, especially if it unlocks additional feature in the game - which removing ads is.
