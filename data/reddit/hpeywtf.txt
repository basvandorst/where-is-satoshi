Well arguing mainstream findings doesnt man you are anti intellectual. It may just mean that you dont believe in research that is bought. And I am not suggesting that all cell phone radiation or all GMO or whatever research is bought. I just want to make clear, that there are often actual reasons, such as industry financing or certain philosophies (think differing schools of thought in economics), that make research questionable.
Eventually, science may prove what really happened (see for example the case of cigarettes or climate change, both denied for decades), but for now, all I can say, that I also do not believe all that mainstream science says. If you look closely, there are always some well-done studies out of major universities (such as MIT) that suggest different findings from what the mainstream narrative is. One example:

Well in my opinion it just (rightfully) ridicules the idea that anybody can be whatever gender they want. I dont hate on anyone and there are certainly people who were born in the wrong body, and such, bu these are like 1% of the population. Most people have a clear gender identity based on their physical sex and thusly cant choose their gender freely.

Another German here: Start up scene in Berlin is pretty vivid, mostly tech and b2b startups, always among the top3/top4 European Start-Up capitals, funding wise. We even have a vivid Blockchain scene, think of IOTA (located in Berlin), besides others. Most of what you list is true, but it doesnt keep Germany from being at the forefront of some things. I also think starting and running a company is pretty easy in Germany. I run two, and it's really not hard...

I think all you say makes sense. The US however is a global super power with a lot of soft power over dozens of countries, especially in Western Europe (where major economies are located) and some Eastern European countries. Similarly, China has a lot of soft power over many African countries (google "stadium diplomacy"). If CH + US governments were strongly pushed by their financial elite to ban all cryptos... well, I could see that happening in the 2 largest economies of the world with a huge push for all their respective allies and "friends" to do the same. If like 50 major economies banned cryptos, things would look dark. Russia and Brazil alone wouldnt be a sufficiently large markets.
I hope it never happens though. It s not super likely, but I could theoretically see smth like that happen.
