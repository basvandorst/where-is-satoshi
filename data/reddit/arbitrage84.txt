Time is the enemy of trading. If transferring bitcoin is not instant then a trader is exposed until the transaction verifies.

They'll delay again. I think they max out around 200ish days.

Very interesting. I thought I read that tether was located in the US. That would make the whole situation much more favorable for US bfx account holders.

I can't believe it. Mt gox all over again. I wonder how long it will take for the price to stabilize this time...

Oh come on man. They aren't using an independent auditor. I will be shocked if they actually reopen for trading before some letter agency shuts them down. I am sure that a judge will slap them with an injunction by Friday.

I don't think it's possible under our regulatory system. Bitcoin transactions take too much time to verify. If transfer was instant then it would be possible to have true leverage.

coinbase should cease ops. They are terrible.
