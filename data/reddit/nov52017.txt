Do you not see the irony in saying this?  People treat it like an investment.  They don't treat it like money.  As he explained in his last paragraph.  Your rebuttal basically says: people have to invest first, then it becomes money.  And buy the dip and hodl are not silly memes.  It's serious advice people are giving and receiving constantly.
Just look at this sub.  Hardly any of the posts are about using Bitcoin as money and the ones that are are about how much it sucks as money e.g. high transaction fees.  


The USD is a global currency.  Oil is traded in it, other currencies base their price on it, and it is preferred in many developing countries due to its stability.

I think I have a better analogy to explain it.  
Imagine if you take your hand and reach it as far up into your ass as you can.  Then grab onto whatever is in there, pull it out and post what it says.


Nothing.  That was the ChoosyBeggor's entire point.  Even if the blockchain is as valuable as he says, that doesn't make Bitcoin valuable.  The likelihood that the first is the ultimate winner is low.


The potential is... to the moon

And here I was thinking a bitcoin was like money.  I missed the transition when it went from a currency to undeveloped property.

The problem with deflationary currencies is the rich people HODL.  If your rate of return is higher doing nothing than it is investing, then you do nothing.  The entire point of inflation is to make people find more productive things to do with their money than hoard it.
Can you not see this exact situation playing out in Bitcoin?  It's supposed to be a currency.  HODL shouldn't even be in peoples' vocabulary.  The entire point of money is to be spent.  That's why it exists.
