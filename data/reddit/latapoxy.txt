Hmm well when I went to college and did research papers that literally how I found all my information just by browsing the web.... 
wtf? Am I suppose to go the library and check out a book on bitcoin? 
Watching one of the most highly regarded and influential figures on the bitcoin scene is research... just like listening to some big shot investor like... oh idk warren buffet for example, would be for conventional stock investing

What are you trying to show? That 99% of the time it’s above that arbitrary trend line you drew?

Small scale yes, but when your talking about HUGE monetary investments..... in today's day in age the only people who can take that kind of investment is the US government. That's why banks need to be bailed out by the government and same with other larger corporations. i.e. GM, Ford..
governments bails out the companies to keep the GDP in the country and prevent the bankruptcy of corporations.

Agreed, we are also 30 years out until 21M btc. As far as I’m concerned most of us are here for the long haul. There will certainly be huge dips and monumental run ups. Fact is if you believe in the tech 30 years from now we will all be buying with btc instead if $$$

I have heard a lot about ripple but haven’t actually looked into it too much. I’ll give it a look today but do you care to discuss a little bit about the pros and cons and how ripple can solve this problem?
