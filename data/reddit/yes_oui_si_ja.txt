Just to clarify: Open Source doesn't have to mean "for free" or "free to copy and resell". Like a book. You can buy a copy, but there are rules for what you can do with it.
But of course, making your software open source will make it harder to actually enforce those terms if you are just a poor developer.

I am so sorry. Really embarrassing to have misunderstood such an important concept.
Thanks for clearing that up. I felt actually really confident that I knew my way around the topic, but damn...
The Dunning-Kruger effect in action!

I've been wondering about this for a while, so maybe you could help me: 
When people say "We cracked X thousand $", which exchange are they referring to? 
Is there any agreed-upon index of the current price, some kind of weighed average of exchanges?

Gave my siblings about $15 each in BTC last christmas. 
I had hoped they'd enjoy a few percent increase in value, maybe even a few dozen if it went well.
 Well, here we are. This has been my most "expensive" gift ever and I am a hero.
I don't feel like any prognosis for Christmas 2018 is appropriate.

Agreed! 
While I understand the enthusiasm, there is too little critical thinking shown in that presentation.
As a teacher, if I can't see that you arrived at a certain position AFTER carefully weighing all factors, I have to give you a mediocre score. 
Still, some good work!

Adding to other comments, the amount of fuel per mile was enormous.
You could say that it wasn't so much an invention  that could revolutionize travels as more a symptom of the cheap and "who cares about the future of our kids"-times.
Sure, the Concorde was amazing engineering. But it was made possible due to low oil prices and availability of very rich people.

Yes, I didn't mention this *little detail* since it would distract from the fun.
I might have stretched the meaning of "toddler" a bit, but the system is supposed to be used from 3 years and up. Looks like the product designers had a bit of fun. No one seemed to notice.
And the rug is washable!

The rug can be used for playful programming (for toddlers), so I'm sure someone had some fun or didn't get the irony of a Bitcoin logo on a bank building.

Maybe. But quite brutal that the school has become the new jail.

It's a [Cubetto]( and I don't own it.
I saw it on a workshop about introducing to kids. The presenter (who was not affiliated with the company) was unaware of the meaning of the symbol.
