Have you ever heard of Google?

The NSA didn't claim shit, some dude on medium did. [Heres the original article]( This is some tabloid clickbait, nothing too see here.

Bitstamp and bitcoin.de do that

  Germany compared to  USA. The law blog article talks about suspected terrorists not ordinary people, also the biggest media companies in Germany are publicly traded on the stock market and are not government owned. I don't even know what the fuck you are trying to say with the second article, it literally says that german hospitals have a midwife shortage, how is that in anyway related?

The link doesn't say that. It explicitly says that it is indeed legal to give data to the police.

Bitstamp support disabled 2FA. Usually the support should ask for proof of identity and check recent logins for unusual activity, their employee fucked up.

It doesn't connect to your google account, it only needs permission to use the camera.

A legit exchange should require a scanned photo id to remove 2FA, this is completely unacceptable that Bitstamp uses an email as proof of identity.   
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:52:35
Blockchain doesnt ask for id.

Which exchange takes 0% for fiat? And which store takes btc instead of usd?
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:01:47
I think having bank accounts in the US and accepting American customers counts as having business. Fighting cyber crime is a step forward for all legitime users of bitcoin.

Mate, that's completely normal and the law/Internet has worked forever this way. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:35:51
 . Its their own fault for operating within the united states.
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:59:11
You can commit crimes in the US and then fly to Greece. Btc-e servers were located in California and they accepted customers from the US, including 2 corrupt FBI agents that apparently stole bitcoin from the silkroad investigation.

A private person can refuse to accept fiat, a business cant.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:18:59
I mean technically I can sell stock with 0% fees but not bitcoins. Also you don't buy stuff with bitcoin, bitpay converts it to USD and then pays the vendor for you.

It's almost like you are responsible for the crimes you commit. in a foreign country.

Because they are a legit company operating under a license from the Luxembourgish ministry of finance and have to comply with the law.

Authy can store an encrypted backup of your secrets in the cloud. Proof your identity via your phone number and then decrypt your authy backup with your passphrase.

It doesn't. It's in everyone's interest to stop cyber criminals like the wannacry group from attacking hospitals and other public infrastructure or people selling illegal material on dark markets. 5 million euro is overall a very small price to pay to give Interpol and other law enforcement the tools needed to combat organized crime in a more effective way.

It actually is "A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace".

Weird that none of them follow the
