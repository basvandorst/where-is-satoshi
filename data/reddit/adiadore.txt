Thats what I meant, do we want to even more head in the centralizationed direction or not?
And personally I don't care how much operating a node costs, I (hopefully) could also afford 10$ transaction fees until the end of my life, but this is not about me

trustworthy! /s
Btw, how old is your account? If it’s “new” they had over 10 mio signups in 2 months. Just in case you all wonder why most exchanges struggle to handle the workload

We run the nodes 
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:19:10
So you don't think the current requirements to run a full node (bandwith &amp; disk space) are already borderline exaggerated? 
Because "we" want people to be able to run full nodes everywhere in the world, this is decentralization. Increasing blocksize is a step towards centralization.
Yes, yes the network is overloaded, yes fees are high but we don't sacrifice decentralization for this now when there are further developments ongoing. And yes, the solution will not come tomorrow, but it is worth waiting. 
How long did it take again to be here where we are now? I think we barely started to walk on 2 feet in 2017.

BTC can talk to us? Do you mean like Alexa or what?

If you do it on your home computer then yes, just a portion of the _depreciation_!

quote from Finney "When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.
Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs."
Do you think he talks about himself like that?

Basically its the worth of the mined coin when received minus the costs to mine that coin. That’s your income to tax, % depends on where you live
After that its capital gains
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:15:22
Recording rules depends from where you are, how often do you receive a coin etc.. The income comes from mining, it is still from 19k.
But you can you use the -14k drop to reduce the capital gains from the past = less capital gain taxes or for future gains

you would not believe it, but some devs dont need a gui

when the time comes, the more you can prove the better! These tax people are not stupid (maybe regarding crypto but that will not stay this way), if they do not like something they go up your ass.
I was at a tax consulting firm for advice, in the end they gave me a job offer when they found out im a law student

In my country there has to be an administrative court decision before they come and where there is written what they can do, if search inside the vehicle xyz of person abc is not stated they simply are not allowed to do that. They still do that you file a complaint and get back everything they found inside (if they have no right to keep they can’t use it)
That’s the theory but you know in real it’s more complicated

I‘m not from the US. Where I live mining is a business. Most just don’t report it, but if your electricity bill is like 1000$ a month when a normal households is 50$ someone will call or pay you a visit because business and private electricity prices are not the same.

Plus they have (at least they had) a flat 50€ fee for withdrawals so minus that its average price 
edit: i checked it now; 50$ for USD Bank withdrawal, 25€ for EUR, 10€ SEPA

What other more „useful” coins do you trade it for?
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:51:49
Outgoing transactions happen from the same place, so .. yes
