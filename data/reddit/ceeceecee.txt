Same issue here :( waiting over 2 weeks for enhanced verification. Ticket  I can understand that they have to look at a lot of support tickets. But this is not an acceptable timeframe.

it would be great if you can add coinbase.
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:42:37
i would also like to hear why they are doing this and who has forced them to do this! "regulatory" is not enough for me.

25BTC but no money for a hardware wallet? I'm really sorry for your loss but you should have invested some time or money into a save Bitcoin Wallet.

waiting for a statement from @_date: 2015-01-31 11:22:25

5 fucking EUROS€€€€!!!! no thanks! that is around 17% of my internet bill! 
bitcoin should make payments easy and cheap. not easy and expensive!
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:16:48
+1 that would have been the best solution. release something that will make everyone happy. but no they are acting like it will be the end of the world if they raise the blocks to 2MB.

i know that there are different calculators but
1. diff at 500 million is a bit away. not far but still away.
2. constant diff -&gt; seriously? :D
this is a nice calculator: 
but you can only set a monthly diff increase :/
@_date: 2013-10-03 22:13:45
i really want to see this calculation.
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:01:26
thanks for you answer and the screenshots! ;) so much $ and we have to start the psu with a paper clip :/. that's not nice at all! i hope more miner will arrive tomorrow. can  you also say how high your hashrate now is?
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:00:06

@_date: 2013-10-03 16:20:06
nice :) may i ask you where you live and which order # you have. it would also be nice if you can say more. i am interested if there is any manual that comes with the miner and a few more screenshots from the miner and maybe interface would be great! also can you tell me how you have start the miner? is there any power button so the psu gets any signal?
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:44:49
