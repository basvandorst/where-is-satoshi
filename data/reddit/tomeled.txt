Bitylicious is perfect, quick easy and secure, I've used it for a year or so, big and small transactions. Was a bit scared at first, putting money into a random bank account, but it works!

I only see a download to the 0.1.1 Alpha, is this the latest version?
When I download and run it on Windows 7 64, it starts to load the installer then just quits, I can't get it to do anything. Help!

Yeah I have Hive on android but there doesn't seem to be any way to connect it to the web wallet, unless I'm missing something?

Thank you for making my day! $3 @_date: 2014-11-24 21:36:49
Ok, what about Hive Web? I've tried it in Mycelium/wallet32/electrum and it doesn't recognise it. What IS Hive Web compatible with? £1 @_date: 2014-11-24 21:47:16

Yeah, they've been taking it for a while. When they first started, the Glasgow store ONLY dealt in Bitcoin for 3 days, pretty cool, though I have yet to go and try it.

Brilliant suggestions, thanks a lot!

To be honest I'm very surprised they haven't already. Valve are usually at the forefront of these types of things. But having the gaming community on board will be a great thing for bitcoin.

Cool! I ordered mine yesterday. Hopefully will help me to stop worrying about having my coins stolen!

Great stuff, thanks man, they're just making a site now, so that'll be easy to implement. I guess it wouldn't be bad to have links to the popular streaming sites anyway? User choice and all that. Is it something you'd donate for? (assuming you liked the music!)

Hive have a good HD web wallet and a companion android/iOs app. Best of both worlds for small-moderate amounts

I've just started using BitcoinAuthenticator. No one's mentioned it for some reason but they've just released a new version with multi sig and 2FA. I think it's quite good for storing a small-medium amount of coins, plus it looks purdy.

1. I'm a little confused about private keys and HD wallets, I'd like to get this sorted so I can relax. I have the 12-word phrase memorised, but have never seen the private keys, and wouldn't know where to find them either. Everyone's always going on about them, so I just want to make sure I'm not missing something, seems overly simple, "memorize little phrase, only existence of that phrase now is in my brain, so assuming I wasn't being watched/hacked upon creation, I'm good right?"
2. Why don't more wallets use the same HD spec or whatever it's called, seems there's a lot of differences which has me worried if one goes down, I need to find one with the same spec, BIP38 I think? To get my funds back with my phrase, right?
3. With my wallet, I sent some coins to another wallet, in Mycelium, and could see the balance of the original wallet in the transaction history. Do I have to manually create a new address, send funds to that, then send the funds from there so people don't see my balance? so confused!
Tips for good answers :)

Ah yes it did, under "unknown" program group! Might wanna check that!

Just realised there's two hive wallets on the play store, I was using the old one, wondering why it wasn't updating, that's confusing!!

Thanks, do you have any examples? Would Soundcloud be a good option?
