1. If the transaction doesn't get confirmed, eventually your coins will come back to your wallet.
2. By using Bitcoin, you agree that your money solely depends on the miners and can get stuck when the network is too busy.

Really hope so. My fee is 60% of the transaction amount and it's been 2 days no confirmations. "Bitcoin is easy-to-transfer" they say..

If you made all your decisions solely based on what's happened in the past, you're not going to go very far in life. I'm not saying you're wrong here, however - but you probably get what I mean.

I'd love to get paid to post this crap. And if I do get paid, why would I go away? Your logic is flawless.

Bitcoin is so abusable, literally. And I like how everyone's saying that no one controls Bitcoin, yet there are literally just few people/organizations that control most of the mining scheme. So if they give up on it, Bitcoin network would go boom... dead.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:25:13
I agree. The problems need to be addressed and fixed asap.

If you want your money to rely on the miners, and be prone to attacks, then sure go for it. (2017)
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:01:14
No one will help you - it's Bitcoin. Besides there was an attack which caused transactions to get stuck because if you use Bitcoin your money can literally get stuck whenever few organizations (Chinese ones) decide so. It's called a currency that is controlled by others.

Because Bitcoin network (blockchain) is a *public* peer-to-peer network. They get information the same way some sites get info about the torrents for example.

When you put higher fee on the transaction, miners will prirotizie it on the network because it provides more BTC for them. The people who have hundreds of BTC (mostly the early investors) don't mind putting higher fees on their transactions so that their transactions get confirmed quicker on the network.

I firmly believe that bitcoin is just a trend rather than something that is stable and permanent. It's kinda like a fashion product, which honestly makes it a very risky investment.
With interest comes value. Gold is valuable because it's hard to get, and people want gold. The bitcoin network is getting way too complex for regular use - high fees even for smaller transactions and long waiting times, plus the fact that you can't ever know how much the value will rise or fall.

So you're basically expecting that everyone who talks about Bitcoin should only give positive feedback on it? Oh man, that's such a great way to improve any product or service! (definitely no sarcasm...)
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:23:26
If you send without a fee, there's a high chance that the coins will come back to your wallet and the transaction fails. Bitcoin is known for having ridiculous fees nowadays. Even with regular fees, be prepared to wait.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:49:03
Yes. The BTC world considers that as a regular fee.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:54:48
Yes, you have to wait. It's the super-fast "easy-to-transfer" Bitcoin network as we know it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:11:46
Yes you could say there's a similarity between this and the attacks towards IRL bank systems. What I'm saying however, is that most of the mining scheme is controlled by few parties/organizations so if they felt like giving up on it, your money would be stuck. It hasn't happened in the past despite the breaks and conflicts but if you made all your decisions solely based on what's happened in the past, you're not going to go very far in life. 
BTC is a very risky investment even if people are going to convince you otherwise here. I highly recommend that you only invest the amount of money that you're also ready to lose; either due to price drops or network issues. Be prepared for literally anything to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:44:08
So I'm a troll for giving negative feedback on Bitcoin? That is a very typical Bitcoin fanboy thing to say.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:02:34
Because Bitcoin is completely controlled by the rich ones. These people have so much of it that they don't mind putting higher fees on their transactions, resulting in being heavily prioritized over others.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:02:50
Google it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:48:43
4 DAYS?!? That is just mean. It's hilarious how they say that Bitcoin is so powerful and easy-to-trasnfer. I'm laughing everytime they claim that :D
