Yeah, and the higher up the net worth you go, the bigger the impact of those 'hang outs'. In bitcoin, Core and Miners are probably the highest you can get in the totem pole.

One thing that scares be about LN is how high the fees might get. Lets say it's all good and everyone uses it, pretty much everything is done through payment channels on the LN. In this scenario, the bitcoin blockchain is the settlement layer. How high will the fees be? When I got into bitcoin, I saw it as a store of value that was protected from government and inflation, but now I'm scared that I won't be able to afford to transact on the blockchain. Core devs want small blocks that creates an artificial fee market that will rise as payment processors outbid each other for a spot in the next block. I honestly don't know if regular people will be able to afford it. If only payment processors can afford to put transactions on chain, it is essentially centralized and that worries me, too.
I know that an increase in block size is in the works but who decides what is the right size? 
When I first got into bitcoin, I thought that the block limit would get lifted forcing miners to compete in hardware, bandwidth, and electricity costs which let the free market decide what fees are.
Anyone got any answers?

@_date: 2017-12-14 17:35:47


Of course not, once paypal and visa are running the LN we are fine. When it's all implemented, we won't need to settle on chain. That's for the big payment processors to do. Bitcoin is a settlement layer not a peer to peer electronic cash system like bcash. Stay decentralized, 1MB forever.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:13:20
Who defines what is average? What is centralization? 1MB has been working fine so keep it at that. Simple. Leave it alone. If you want bigger blocks, go to BCash. 2MB with segwit was attemted but the community didn't want it. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:23:47


@_date: 2017-12-14 17:52:34
No, segwit is already a block size increase as Gregory Maxwell said. If we bump it up to 2MB people will be asking for 4MB. That's only one doubling away from BCash which is at 8MB. Let them have their cheap TX fees. Bitcoin is a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:20:01


Exactly, trust the core developers guys. Bitcoin is a store of value. Fees are supposed to be high to have a fee market. Decentralization is the most important factor.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:02:44

@_date: 2017-12-14 18:50:33


So then 1MB perfect for all the people with low end computers to run a node. Need to keep the RPi nodes alive!


So what is a good ratio? How do you find one rich guy running thousands of nodes? HMMMM?? You can't. 


Stop trying to make Segwit2X happen. 


What were the other reasons? So if the core developers said it's ok you will run it? I bet you will you big blocker you. Better get to convincing them! Good luck, you'll need it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:41:50
Do you want btc to get centralized?? We MUST keep the 1MB limit! Just keep watching bcash, it will crash and burn.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:57:20
No, core devs went through all this effort to soft fork with segwit to keep the 1MB hard limit TO AVOID A HARD FORK!
Remember Gavin and Hearn were talking about bigger blocks for years? Why give in now? Stay decentralized, 1MB forever!
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:18:10
Lol chill out be patient. Bitcoin has the network effect. More and more people are using altcoins but it's ok. LN will save us.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:04:58
No hardfork. Need to keep consensus. That's why core devs did segwit as a softfork so they can keep commit access. What if another development team came up with a different implementation that everyone liked? That's bad for bitcoin. Core devs know what they are doing. That's why they started Blockstream. They are developing layer 2 solutions to sell to other companies. Then fees will be cheap for us since we can go use the services those companies offer.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:05:32
the core devs said there may be a block size increase in the future. They know what they are doing. The bitcoin community doesn't want 2Mb. Remember Segwit2X? REJECTED! Go use bcash if you want bigger blocks you shill.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:01:42
Yes, and your reasons have been repeated by the segwit2x'ers and big blockers. Heard it all. No bigger blocks. Nope. segwit is a block size increase remember? What core says goes. Blockstream knows what's best for them. Once they are able to sell layer 2 solutions, we can use bitcoin like bcashers use bcash. Except bitcoin is a store of value so it will be worth more. check and mate.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:21:52
Sorry, yeah, I'm just saying you probably won't get an unbiased answer in this sub.

Wow that takes me back. Good thing bitcoin is a store of value now. We don't need a tipbot like r/btc has.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:40:31
Wait for all the layer 2 solutions. Trust the core devs, they know what they are doing. Once users find out that a hard fork to 2MB is not a big deal, they will be asking for 4MB or 8MB or more! Insanity. Do you want to go down the same path as bcash? Let them have their low fees, fast TX times, "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" and their gigablock coffee coin. We have a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:43:57
Seriously, OP is acting like users have no choice. Way over blown.

@_date: 2017-12-14 16:52:45
NO, needs to stay at 1MB for decentralization. Stop trying to FUD people into believing that 2MB is ok. What do you want next 4MB?
 8MB? that's bcash. And you say you're not for bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:55:00


Why? you seem to want what it offers, low TX fee. bitcoin is a store of value. Take it or leave it bud.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:44:19
Maybe in the future. that's what Greg Maxwell said. They are looking into it. It's been years since bigger blocks have been proposed but they still need more time. Do you want them to end up like Gavin and Hearn? NO.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:22:03
Bitcoin is a STORE OF VALUE! Don't you get it? Jimmy was right in saying to use CC or bcash or whatever is fast and cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:47:54


It's moot btw. No, the Core devs know best, it needs to stay 1MB for decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:45:40
Bitcoin must stay at 1MB even if the people that run the nodes might not be able afford the TX fees in the future! There needs to be a fee market, $100 TX fee is fine, more the better to decentralize!
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:06:09
No, remember when the bitcoin dominance was slipping and people were crying the sky was falling? It's back up to 54% currently. It will climb back up as more people buy in.
Don't use bitcoin for a measly $200. Bitcoin is a store of value. The high fees should have convinced you of that. HODL forever!
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:28:26
I'm banned. Am I?
Hahha yeah. I agree with you.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:12:10


Right, so if blocks stay at 1MB it's less to send than 2MB.


1Mb blocks will make it so running a node is more accessible to people. BCash people say that people don't need to run non mining nodes. Do you want that?


Right! so who knows what might happen with a 2Mb HF. 1MB is safe.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:42:45
Well if you sell, you will turn into a weak hand. Why would you want people to spend their coins like bcash? I been over there once and they were tipping each other! Can you believe that. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:39:03


So be patient.


yes you can. 
Why do you think bcash is a shitcoin? They have bigger blocks and cheaper fees. Do you want bitcoin to turn into bcash? i dont!
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:23:30
No bitcoin is a store of value. If you use bcash you can use it. It's being used on the shithole of the other sub.
@_date: 2015-12-01 01:25:13
If Coinbase/R3 starts supporting something I do not, then my interests do not align with them. At this point I see R3 as a group that wants to be told what to do at their respective banks, not an organization that wants to shut down bitcoin. Even if they wanted to, I don't believe they can.
I don't think patents have anything to do with the block size debate. Other bitcoin companies will take Coinbase to court if they try to push those vague patents forward. If Gavin or XT tries push development toward a direction I don't like, I will support something else.
I don't think they will succeed in controlling the protocol. Theymos and Blockstream Core are trying that now. People will just fork it. I believe the government and even R3 will move too slow to kill bitcoin while it's young. Even if it does, I will just move to another, better crypto.
I just strongly believe that keeping small blocks will centralize P2P transactions which would make it easier for governments to stop those centralized businesses (like how Coinbase is monitoring transactions because of government). I just want the option to avoid using bitcoin banks (Coinbase) and I think bigger blocks are the answer to that.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:18:36
yup, it's a store of value anyway. Let the weak hands leave and use bcash with low fees. bitcoin needs to stay decentralized. Adoption can wait.
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:27:52


Which is why I don't understand why block size hasn't been raised to even 2MB to start.
I think LN is great if it works, but if alpha is a couple months out I feel it's too long. Maybe it's not.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:36:46
Remember segwit2x? REJECTED. Don't you understand the community doesn't want it? Get over it 2MB isn't happening. Stop trying to centralize bitcoin. How much is Roger paying you lol. segwit2x is GONE. DONE. Why all of a sudden you want it now. Makes no sense. NO2X!!!  Proof of twitter my friend.
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:37:56
What is a good block size in your opinion? I don't think there will be any detrimental effect to either nodes or miners by raising it to 2MB.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:55:02
Right? let them have their fast TX and low fee coffee coin. It will crash and burn. Stay decentralized! 1MB forever!

@_date: 2015-12-01 00:22:27
Not sure what point you're trying to make with the video; bitcoin already circumvents government. Take a look at the dark net markets. Sure, they took down the original Silk Road that started it all and now there are multiple alternatives. 
For Coinbase patents, the answer is right in the thread: 
All of those are way too vague to pass and many of those exist already.
I can understand why Coinbase monitors transactions. So do banks today. We all know the government will hold them accountable if they don't do anything. Good thing is, I don't have to use Coinbase if I don't want to. With small blocks, I won't have a choice will have to use something like Coinbase to use bitcoin, but if that happens, it won't be Satoshi's bitcoin. I'll find another crypto if that happens.
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:12:49
The 8GB is in 2036, 20 *years* from now. Even if 8GB is too big, miners don't have to mine full blocks. BIP 100 doesn't even have any code out yet. I'm sure if it was everyone would switch to it.
Good thing about bitcoin is that no one has to run the same code as the government. If any gov tried, they would fork and the rest of the world would leave them behind.
I'm not worried about bandwidth because there are many places that can handle 8GB blocks today and connection speeds will improve for the rest.

You keep touting that but you're okay with Blockstream influencing development? Don't tell me you don't know about the censorship going on in this sub. Do you want to keep 1MB blocks? Or just a slower rate of increase in block size?

Essentially threads about changing bitcoin for bigger blocks were censored under the guise of it being an altcoin and people got mad.
This was stickied for a few months. I'll let you decide on what Theymos means.
The most recent stunt (at least it's not outright banning-they can't according to their rules since it's BIP 101 and not a fork):
You can find other examples in other bitcoin subreddits but I don't want to be banned for linking them.
**edit:** I guess going to BIP 101 will get BitStamp banned from r/bitcoin.

Yes, if it's killed it's unusable. I am sure that every time it's killed, the crypto that replaces it will be much better and even harder to kill. They can't even stop it right now so they are trying to go the over-regulation route (that only stops businesses not bitcoin). It's already a mess with all the censorship by Theymos. No one said it was going to be clean.
Are you worried about how big the blocks can get or do you want to keep 1MB blocks?
@_date: 2015-12-01 19:25:38
Again, I'll mention 8GB is 20 year into the future. What is a good block size limit for you?


It's not going straight to very big blocks. Who is complaining?
I definitely think block size has to be raised. 1MB is too small. I think keeping small blocks will promote centralization.
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:46:38
Right. But let's say, for whatever reason, BU is majority of nodes now. When a &gt;1MB block is mined, it will be propagated and accepted by majority of nodes because &gt;1MB is the consensus now. You would accept the BU running bitcoin ecosystem?
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:12:54
I was wondering what specifically changed your views?
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:35:28
that's what I'm trying to do.


How do nodes hold miners accountable? They can also be spoofed so miners can't accurately determine what nodes want.
You should write a post on what changed your mind since you have a unique perspective of going from wanting bigger blocks to keeping small blocks. I'd read it.

People are working on "layer 2" technology such as Lightning Network that works on top of the base layer that is bitcoin that is highly anticipated. It promises a decentralized nature and huge increase in transaction capacity. Unfortunately, it's still in testing. 
Coinbase is providing a service that works on top of bitcoin in a centralized way (as Coinbase controls all bitcoin sent to it). I'm saying this is still considered "layer 2" but just not a decentralized "layer 2" as people had hoped.
I speculate that delays in sending bitcoin "on chain" (using bitcoin directly) caused eGifter problems and so they switched to only accepting bitcoins sent from a Coinbase wallet (since using Coinbase's network has no delays).

Right, and if they do why would users stick to a coin with no hash power behind it? Whatever fork miners mine is effectively *the* bitcoin now (which would have to be in line with users' interests


Miners can run their own nodes and propagate their own blocks to other miners and nodes that use the same implementation. Other miners enforce the rules. I get what you mean by nodes enforce the rules but they have very little power and can't be relied upon to show consensus because it is relatively easy to spoof nodes.


But say it isn't about security. Just ideological ones where there is no right or wrong. If miners disagree with nodes and there is a chain split, why would the node only chain survive? Bitcoin price will take a hit but the chain with no miners will be really weak.


How are they making mistakes when they choose the block size they can handle and one they think is best for the network? Miners won't fork unintentionally because they lose profits. 


I consider this a feature and it forces users to pay attention to the network. Their self interest will prevent them from using settings that fork them off. 


It's not about more control (as no single user can force others), it is more about allowing each user to have a voice.


But it is not a reliable measure of support because it can be faked.
Thank you for engaging me on this. I do feel nodes are more important now.
@_date: 2017-02-18 17:36:05

Let's say price doesn't matter. If miner's disagreed with nodes, what's stopping all miners from agreeing to a different implementation and leaving old nodes behind? Nodes by themselves do nothing. I guess this is the part where some users suggest HF away from miners and changing the algo (which I don't think anyone will use this chain)? I believe it is miners doing what is best for users to keep them using bitcoin, not nodes.


Isn't this pretty much configuring consensus rules?


By end users do you mean nodes? If you do, isn't that what they are doing now by running a node with the implementation they want?


What exactly is a consensus forming block? Sorry I feel like I'm looking at it from a different point of view and I'm not getting what you mean.
Say currently all nodes and miners are using Core v1. What if there is a rise of many nodes signalling they want Core v2 and 95% of nodes are running Core v2. So then miners HF to Core v2 and it seems like everyone is happy but it turns out it was just one person spinning up a bunch of hosted server nodes.


I appreciate your time.

What makes you think another crypto can't catch up to where bitcoin is?
Every time bitcoin goes through a "right of passage", it stalls bitcoin growth which give other coins a chance to catch up. Since bitcoin paved the way, other coins won't have any difficulty going through the same "right of passage" and can catch up to bitcoin.

* **This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB**, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.
Emphasis is mine. Where's the **2MB HF** proposal? Please don't point me to Luke Jr.'s fork...


Nodes are only a very small portion of the equation that is unreliable. It's the reason we rely on miners and PoW.


Funny, that's how I see Core.


Yeah, because the second they talk about anything but Core, they get blacklisted. As BU gains more support, the scales will tip and people will be more comfortable voicing their opinions. 
Stupid, shortsighted, ego driven theymos screwed it all up by not allowing organizations to voice their opinions. fuck theymos
You will stick with Core and their sinking ship because you do not have a full understanding of how bitcoin incentives work.

There will never be 100% consensus. BU supporters (or anyone for that matter) are strongly incentivized to follow the economic majority which is why they haven't forked off. I don't know what will get economic majority support though.
What I worry about is the deadlock causing migration to other cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:56:13
The biggest touted negative I hear is the fear of a chain split. Others think that blocks have to be full for bitcoin to work. A few think BU is an attack on bitcoin funded by Ver and Jihan.
I disagree with all of the above. You'll have to read both subs to make your own decision.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:30:56
I would like the info on EC mechanism too. Can I have a source?
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:22:16
Yes, the article assumes bitcoin doesn't run into any problems and that bitcoin users are not hedging. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:44:15
Only people that can afford run nodes will do it. Just like how it is now. Miners will also be cautious as too large of a block will scare users away.
Also, no one is talking about jumping to 100TPS right away. 2MB is safe and can be handled by pretty much everyone. 


Can you provide a source? It's the first time I heard of it. I am completely against inflation. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:53:48
There are many working on it. The 1MB limit is giving miners in China an advantage (cheap subsidized electricity) since they don't have to compete with bandwidth. Core keeps saying they value decentralization but are okay with mining centralized in China. And it doesn't help that Adam "Phd" Back sets up meetings with Chinese miners to keep using Core's bitcoin implementation.
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:45:08
So let's please UASF ASAP.
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:30:28
Do you not worry that being too conservative will give other cryptos a chance to overtake bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:45:57
Bravo. Nice checkmate.
@_date: 2016-06-01 15:50:48
Isn't collusion already happening when a small group can convince a handful of people in China to stick to a certain implementation instead of the Nakamoto consensus?
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:44:25
It doesn't matter too much in the long run if it is bad now. If BU becomes the majority client, then devs will contribute to BU. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:30:39
And then the fed up people take cars, buses, trains, boats, and spaceships (other cryptos) instead. I don't get how people do not see this.
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:46:30
How is it not prudent?
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:07:20
21 million divided by X club. 500,000 club is 42 coins, 250,000 is 84, 100000 is 210, 10000 is 2100 coins. One in a million flows the best, though.

The conscious, voluntary decision to remove the block size limit may be taking place. Ultimately, the economic majority will win out, whatever that may be.
@_date: 2016-11-28 18:49:50
Thanks. Now I know there were no true hard forks in bitcoin. Those incidents convince me that if there are any problems, miners will figure it out. Hard forks have been tested on alts and have proven to be successful so I'm sure there won't be any problems with bitcoin. Especially when hard forks are intentional hehe.
@_date: 2016-12-27 22:15:11
um okay? I wasn't looking for a debate on whether it satisfies your definition of currency or not... I'll use it for what I need, you can use it for what you need.
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:29:50
They can fork if they mine. Adjust difficulty and PoW away from govcoin. There will always be black market ways to get cryptos. Fiat is centralized right now, but they can't stop bitcoin. 
What do you think will happen when governments have a stronghold? If bitcoin is co-opted, what properties would change? 
Yes, I understand change is difficult. If there is a crisis with bitcoin because of government, the network will route around it as damage. 
I mean, if you go the gov. control scenario, can't the same be said for layer 2 solutions where hubs are co-opted by gov.? Please don't say 'then the user can do on chain' because the average user will be priced out of doing on chain tx. when layer 2 is running. This is me assuming that the block size limit is kept in place and fees have increased. I don't know how much the fees would increase but, I would guess hubs would be paying thousands for on chain tx fees (and I feels thousands is stupid low when billions are transacted on hubs). 
I could argue that gov. could run state sponsored miners to co-opt bitcoin this way. What's stopping them from doing that? Or if China's gov. regulates/co-opts the current miners in China? 
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:03:07
If it comes to that, people will route around that as network damage and will fork it or move to another cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 15:56:47
With the direction Core devs are taking it, you won't be using bitcoin directly to transact on a day to day basis until Lightning Network comes out. Since you're in the US you might use it for international payments as it's currently still cheaper and faster than traditional routes. The other is as an investment vehicle. If there are 7 billion people but only 21 million coins and if it's going to get as big as some speculate it is, having half a percent of your investment portfolio in bitcoin might pay off. Or if you're a day trader, you can profit on its volatility. Or buying stuff on the dark web. i think that's about it.
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:11:34
Now we just need miner support!
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:17:56
That is an entirely different situation. Hard forks have been done many times safely by bitcoin and altcoins when they aren't changing universal agreement of the coin like coin limit or the owner of the coin. 2mb was considered a safe limit and noncententious until censoring and FUD of hard forks were spread. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 18:57:25
Who was against it? I know there was a lot of disagreements on how it should happen. A larger block size limit is a requirement for layer 2, regardless. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:27:45
If that happens, miners will be shut down, too, as they are the ones that actually processing transactions. When that happens, home miners will become viable again and signal smaller blocks. I think it will turn out how the internet currently is with nodes and miners akin to ISPs.
If governments ban only nodes for some reason, miners will lower their block size if it comes to all governments working together so that home nodes can be run again. Without users, miners are nothing. I know people don't like bringing up Satoshi but [Bitcoin was never designed for home nodes to run in the long term]( Bitcoin works because it relies on all participating parties to only look out for themselves, not the good will of a generous few. Greed secures the network. I get what you mean, I want bitcoin to be uncensorable, too. If that government crisis does happen, I'm confident the network will find a way to route around that damage.

It takes time to change the status quo.

What's your prediction in 5 and 10 years?
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:34:13


You're going to have to explain that one to me.


We're in a transition phase. It doesn't have to be simultaneous because you can always accept both. The value of bitcoin will go up because people who use both fiat and bitcoin will eventually keep most in bitcoin because bitcoin is good money.
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:51:27
Are there any estimates/studies on what the block size and TX fee will be when LN is available?
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:29:20
And as fees rise, it will be increasingly for the wealthy.
@_date: 2016-05-25 19:35:14
Can't other implementations that have 2MB copy over Core's changes/upgrades? If miners adopt 2MB I'm willing to bet Core would change their code to 2MB and miners can switch back to Core if they want. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 16:36:40
IF it gets to that point, I will support whatever BIP to solve the issue then. What you're talking about is far off into the future. What we need right now is bigger blocks.
@_date: 2015-10-21 15:25:44
First time see this. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:29:40
Can anyone explain how Core came up with block weight calculation?

Every fight for freedom comes at a cost. If they attack bitcoin, I know they will start hunting us down, but they can't jail all of us. The blessing is that it's not a physical war. 


I'm saying is that they can try and make it illegal on paper, but it'll be like weed; still federally illegal but impossible to stop people from smoking.
I don't think it will be made illegal. It'll be like the internet where the benefits are too great to suppress.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:02:32
Yes, the US gov tried the war on drugs and failed horrrrribly. I am fully aware that they might try (Ben fucking Lawsky fuck him). They will fail. They tried stopping music/movie sharing. They want to ban encryption. They have no power in the digital world where there is a level playing field. It's the reason why they want hardware backdoors. That scares me.
One reason I don't see governments attacking bitcoin is because it gives advantages to governments who don't ban it.
Bitcoin is like a virus. It spread at the low levels first like us, tech savvy retail people. It's starting to attract wall street (tax evasion for the super whales) and their government buddies. Once it infects wall street, their greed will force lobbying of relaxing regulations. I believe if they wanted to, they could have attacked bitcoin after SR1 shutdown. Instead, they sold the bitcoin.
I don't want bitcoin to be kept small because of fear of government retribution like some stockholm-syndromed abused person.
If for some reason they do succeed, we fork. They can't stop cryptocurrencies. It's the next bullet in the chamber following the printing press and the internet.

Funny thing is, everyone didn't know the internet was awesome. I'm okay with it. The tears they shed when bitcoin hits 50k will be delicious. Most are so invested in gold that they're hostile toward anything that might compete with it.
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:39:53
I agree with you 100%. Miners who can't cut it will be replaced by miners who can. Survival of the fittest. There are concerns of a single monopoly on mining but I doubt that. There will be consolidation, but  not a monopoly. If there was going to be a monopoly, it would have happened already. If bitcoin gets huge, governments would want to mine because they don't trust other governments.
A really interesting point that has brought up is the decentralization of mining because of how inefficient centralized mining will become. I highly recommend the read:
@_date: 2015-11-30 16:27:01
As long as it aligns with my interests, yes. That's what consensus is.
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:25:23
Yes, that's fine. How is it utter bullshit? If you think he was wrong, you can fork off. I'm just saying he has no standing on telling big blockers to fork off. It was a temporary spam measure, how is that difficult to understand?
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:08:06


You say that but big blockers can say the same thing. Don't forget that Satoshi already envisioned datacenter level adoption and it's what many of us signed up for. I'm not saying Satoshi was right or wrong, just that the reasons he wrote out set the expectations of bitcoin's future.
I know that we are stronger together so I hope segwit2x pulls through.
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:05:04
Who decides what is good enough? By your logic we should lower the limit because node count is going down so it's even more censorship resistant.
@_date: 2016-07-08 18:40:16
So why is it 1MB? Shouldn't it be 500KB instead?
