No idea why you're getting downvoted. "Read the whitepaper" is an idiotic suggestion for a newbie. It's like somebody wants to learn to drive a car and you say "read this overview of the combustion engine and how a potential highway network might work".

Umm I get it's the "bible" that everybody loves to namedrop for upvotes, but saying it will answer 99.9% of a newbies' questions is ridiculous. Unless the white paper has an addendum which addresses "where to buy bitcoins", "is it too late to mine", "is it too late to invest", or "how do I secure my wallet" it is absolutely not going to help a newbie at all.

To be fair, "this technology" does not necessarily have to be Bitcoin.

Fair enough on the length of the account but:


My comments may be negative and sarcastic, but childish insults? 
That's absolute bullshit to defame my character.

You're in the wrong sub if you want rational discussion. Surprised the lunars haven't downvoted you to oblivion yet.

What everybody keeps forgetting is that it's the *blockchain* that is the innovation, and bitcoin is just the first application of it. Just because the technology of the blockchain is valuable does not mean that bitcoin will remain so.
