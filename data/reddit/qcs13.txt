Not surprised. There was news a while back about a company in Japan that pays staff’s salary in bitcoin. As always, Japan is ahead of the curve. But crypto payment still needs to be simplified and speeded up for mass adoption. For now, cant beat Visa Wave

If i were to judge just based on news (Japanese ICOs with huge Jap companies as partners, etc) i’d think that the opposite is true (Japs are trying to be the first mass adopters). But thanks so much for sharing

My rebuttal: take his nuts out of your mouth. Ur not getting any richer whether he’s satoshi or not. Get a life

Ur right about workers’ concerns about crypto s fluctuations. I would b concerned too if its my paycheck. But i dont live there so cant offer any insights. As for converting btc to local fiat, it differs from exchanges and countries. For example u can use credit card to buy and sell btc on some exchanges. But the fees range from 5-10%. Same or even more expensive when u convert them to fiat, up to 15% maybe. I could be wrong. So pls check the figures on the exchanges u use

One of my friends told me her neighbour sucks his wife’s dick. I think it is not possible. Is it possible? What is your thought?

You are a lucky one. My wife once asked me to lend her boyfriend condoms. He never gave them back

I think the real Satoshi is Trump. He’s secretly brilliant but acts like a fool in real life to conceal his identity
