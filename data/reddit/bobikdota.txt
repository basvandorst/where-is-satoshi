yup, wow indeed
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:42:55
Hang in there, the important thing is it is going to pick up sooner or later.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:15:47
No idea, but OP sure likes it. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:44:25
Tell us something we don't know.

Been there for quite some time, welcome to the club!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:26:28
I just love how the mainstream media keeps comparing bitcoin with banks, when they're so clearly philosophically opposed.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:16:29
Me too! I hope I get it in time for Xmas.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:50:48
[There you go!](
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:09:00
Sorry, missed it.
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:40:55
This is last week's news, why is it only hitting reddit now?
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:50:59
You should gift her some JesusCoin.
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:37:01
Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! 
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:57:11
Lookin' cool. Do you ship to Germany? LE: Nevermind, I figured it out.

My French isn't very good, but is his name really 'Bruno The Mayor'? Has he ever been a mayor? If not, he probably should be. Imagine all the headlines: Mayor The Mayor did this and that.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:47:24
Maybe. But you wouldn't buy the coin, that's different. People didn't buy his books, why would they buy his coin.

Thank goodness I unsubscribed from their spammy, clickbaity newsletters. Would've been better if I hadn't subscribed in the first place, but still.
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:49:09
Twitter is littered with crypto scams, so this is actually good news. Waiting to see if they can implement the ban better than Facebook has. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:44:13
Well, what did you expect? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:38:37
What's with all the 16-year-old talk? What am I missing?
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:46:02
I was wondering the same thing. Why did they work his cousin into the story and not his brother, especially since he seems to have had an important role within the organization. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:42:33
Bullish indeed. However, I expect less talk, more action.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:49:20
Public exposure? I didn't even know he existed. I've just read that he's been trying to milk his brother's image dry for years and it didn't get him very far.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:11:37
Relax, it's just a funny story about a guy who is riddled by conspiracy theories and tries to take advantage of his brother's name to make some money. He won't make any, people aren't *that* stupid. I lost it when he said he would walk up to Buterin and tell him 'sir, you are a gringo'. If you add some Narcos swear words, it gets funnier.

Una cerveza, por favor!

Looking forward to the following announcement from Coinbase: "Our customer support team has gotten their shit together."
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:03:27
Nope, it's for real.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:36:35
Cayman Islands-domiciled Academy? Oh, and of course they're doing a token sale.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:06:18
My story exactly. Paypal's greed made me look into bitcoin. Thank you, Paypal, much obliged!
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:42:14
Shut up, Nuno!

I had missed all previous news about the Brisbane airport and the fact that Brisbane is becoming increasingly crypto-friendly. Judging by some of the comments in this thread, some other people didn't know either. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:40:04
Okay, so we're trusting Maduro now.
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:45:08
Well, it was about time.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:40:17
People do believe a lot of crap, but this guy is too incoherent to be believable. I really don't think he's gonna make any money with this. Not in the slightest bit.
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:58:09
Digital chanda what now?
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:59:55
Snoop ma man, thank you for being so vigilant and protecting us from a dreaded marketing ploy. There's nothing worse than a small, local startup that tries to help spread cryptocurrency adoption in Brisbane. They even helped the local airport incorporate cryptocurrency payments. Pure evil, I tell you!
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:50:52


Of course he didn't, of course there isn't.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:07:51
You just had to do this to us, didn't you?
