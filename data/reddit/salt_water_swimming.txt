The expansion of money supply is a factor in inflation (more dollars -&gt; each dollar is less valuable) but expanding the money supply should not directly be called inflation. If the money supply is expanding but other factors are driving up the value of the dollar more, then deflation is still happening.

The IRS may agree with you but the SEC doesn't.

Yes, or like saying I can buy my morning coffee with PC parts as long as I sell the PC parts for cash and use the cash. 
Bitcoin is supposedly a currency and you used to be able to buy things with it from Microsoft. Now you can't. It's pretty cut and dry, yet here we are.

Shilling bitcoin is also shilling. If you can't pay with BTC, you can't pay with BTC. Saying "you can pay with BTC as long as you convert the BTC to USD first" is ridiculous.

Put another way, it isn't a coincidence that rapid increases in the value of the USD coincide with the great depression and great recession
If you are already rich, dollar deflation is fine, even good (it increases the value of your assets relative to USD, so you can sit on them). If you are not wealthy, then it is very very bad. An entire country cannot operate on a deflating currency without major social problems, so it is good for the USD to experience moderate long-term inflation.
This means that Bitcoin operates more like a savings vehicle than a currency...which is basically what people criticizing Bitcoin as a currency have said all along. There is simply no incentive to spend them.

How will Bitcoin mature as a currency and replace USD for transactions if nobody uses it for transactions because they are waiting for it to mature?

The best they can do is adopt the valuable parts of the blockchain tech and let the currencies try to compete with real money.
Visa and MC are both pretty invested in blockchain development and once they integrate it into their payment network infrastructure, who cares about BTC or Doge or whatever? Mememoney.
