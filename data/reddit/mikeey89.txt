Thanks for the answer

I didn't say that it stops me from mining? But to the case, doesn't it mean that the big mining pools can easily switch to another coin such as BCH or do a fork and then switch to it?

Who said I can't mine? Read my post over again if you thought so. Just reading so much all over the place that people think it's a bad thing about Bitcoin, so I just want to know more about this and pros/cons about it. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 22:38:06
That was what I was asking for, if someone had any thoughts about it. People always tell me that, but I don't get it myself. So what do you think about it. Isn't it any concerns or cons by having a few big players controlling most of the mining? 
@_date: 2018-09-22 22:39:10
Yeah, I agree. But what would happen if Bitmain and other big mining pools shut down their computers and in example only 5 % hashing power was left in Bitcoin?

Maybe I misunderstood. But what happens on 10. August then? I've heard something is going to happen on that date.

I think you will regret in a few days.

Thank you for the excellent explanation!

Why not? With  implementation of SegWit2x it might happen. Few people thought it would split on 1. August, but it did that time as well.

On their official site. They said it will be sent early in September if I order now. That's okay for me. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:54:14
Yes, that's what I thought too. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:15:47
Haha, why? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:51:13
Why would that be a problem?

What do you mean with mooon?

Why do you think that the Ethereum project is a scaling time bomb? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:41:25
I have done my research, but I wanted to hear about others experiences before buying. But now I've decided for Ledger Nano S
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:46:02
Me too. People that says that certain tokens are a scam seems to be unable to back up the argument.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:17:37
I don't think it will split, and I really hope it won't.
