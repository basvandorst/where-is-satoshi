One of these things doesn't mean what you think it means.

Same return in the long run though. Amirite?

When the btc/usd ratio stabilizes to a certain degree wouldn't there be an objectively correct amount of money to spend mining Inflationcoin at any one time? When that many people are mining it no longer makes financial sense to invest in mining. Slightly more people than necessary will mine at any one time, hoping some of the pool drops out due to them losing money in the long run (powering their network costs more than the money they earn) which will constantly happen and new people will pick up the slack. Seems like an indefinite mining period would be fine to me.
Am I still missing something?
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:30:31
So right, I guess that's where my thinking gets tangled: If *literally* every other currency in widespread use today is an inflationary one, that (in my opinion) is *very* strong evidence that inflationary is what works best and the type of currency that would have a shot at wide spread adoption as money and not a psudo-stock/lottery ticket.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:48:48
I agree with every word you just said. My only issue is that by spending bitcoin now and not dollars, that is a bet bitcoin will decrease in value faster than dollars.
Bitcoin still looks like the stocks of the future, not the cash of the future to me. Maybe they're extremely liquid stocks but in the end the lack of pressure to spend, in my eyes, tells me this is the stock of the future and not the cash of the future.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:40:11
Convert to $ before spending. Keep savings in btc.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:39:43
How is that evidence of corruption?
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:48:08
I was looking for someone to convince me otherwise. I do believe bitcoin has value and a place in the future, just not as cash. Maybe I'm wrong, but just I haven't heard a good argument as to why yet.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:06:32
They aren't thinking about them. So for all intents and purposes they do not exist right now.

"They" changed it because gold was inflationary and now it is deflationary. It was inflationary because there were actual gold miners who pulled gold from the ground thus lowering the value of all other gold in circulation (since there is now more of it).
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:24:17
Right, so putting aside if deflationary currency works or not for the moment[0], do you think a government would ever endorse one? If not do you think Bitcoin still has a shot to be a mainstream currency?
[0] Super interesting argument for another day. I personally see the advantages of an inflationary system, it's the lending system that scares me the most.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:10:23
Sort of not true. Even if bitcoin stabilizes and is being used as money regularly, if that 1m btc wallet spends even one btc the value of btc will drop because people will realize another 1m btc has entered the market. 
It would be like if someone was sitting on 1 trillion dollars and everyone knew it. Once they started spending that trillion dollars every other dollar would be worth less since (not quite, but pretty much) 1 trillion dollars was just created.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:28:40
Ah okay, that was what I was asking. I was wondering if bitcoin would ever be more than a decentralized ATM (which is actually amazing when you think about it). You would never actually **give** btc away for goods or services, you would change a small amount to $ and keep everything you can in btc.
I am totally okay with that and I think most people are. It just seems like a lot of people think btc will drive out government issued inflationary currency completely at some point and I just can't see that happening without some sort of government meltdown or revolution.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:44:52
Totally agree with everything you said. I was talking about like 25 - 50 years from now though.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:13:00
If one merchant accepted only btc no one would buy from them if there was another merchant that accepted dollars.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:17:11
There are people out there with enough bitcoins to crash the market if they dump fast enough. Litecoins and other altcoins offer less volitale markets. Either way, both markets are too young to make a call on just yet. They're all just lottery tickets at this point. (imo)

I shit you not, I double majored in psychology (concentration in neuroscience) and computer science (concentration in AI). I actually have 100s of hours in both subjects. Recently I've moved to game AI (poker is my specialty) but I could talk your ear off about most sorts of AI related problems. Granted I'm a grunt programmer now so I'm not up to date on the bleeding edge of AI research but let's say I'm not scared for my kids or my kids kids being replaced with robots. I'm not joking, PM me if you want to talk more about that. As you can tell I enjoy a good discussion.
Back on topic:
You totally lost me with the second part of that. I don't understand what "subsidized the mining algorithm into perpetuity" means. Can you ELI5?
I'm guessing that means that governments will start spending money to subsidize mining. That's totally fine though since all countries will be spending money to mine the blockchain in parallel. Also by government endorsement, I just mean something along the lines of "you can now pay your taxes with BitflationCoin". Boom. Instant adoption. (circle back to the previous paragraph if I missed something and this point is moot)
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:09:49
We're quickly veering off topic I think. My main point is I have 10 btc and $200. I see something that costs $200 or .2 btc. Why would I ever hand over 2 btc when I know that will be with more later?
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:51:43
I wouldn't. I'd hold the deflating currency and never spend it. That's my question. Why would I spend Bitcoin? Why should the government endorse a currency that causes less spending?
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:53:48
Okay, now we're arguing semantics. My original question is would btc ever be different than stocks? The conclusion I have come to is no, I will continue to treat bitcoin as a stock while there are still inflationary currencies to spend.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:38:55
And we don't spend gold.
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:20:25
I suppose indirectly this is true. They stopped backing money with gold because gold limited the amount of money the government could create. The government wants the ability to create money at will and gold backed currency wouldn't allow that.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:20:59
Inflation makes wealthy people's money get less valuable overtime. It forces them to invest if they want to stay at break even in terms of overall net worth. If they don't spend then that's okay still because more money is coming into the system somewhere and they aren't getting any of it without investing their money.
I think this is better for 90% of the people participating in whatever hypothetical financial system we're talking about.
Basic income is a good idea. I think it would make the economic situation better than it is now for most of the people involved (which is always the goal I think), however if you were to ask me my ideal solution to the wealth inequality problem I would tell you I don't know, but I wish it could come through policy changes and not a handout.
Coming back to bitcoin for a second: I love bitcoin. Bitcoin has started a revolution in how we think about money. I just think it would be infinitely better, and have a much better chance at being adopted as cash, if the miners were rewarded new bitcoins indefinitely. This would control the rate of inflation and make it so no one can just "print more money" if banks (or whatever we call banks in the future) are loaning too much. In all honesty I can't get this idea out of my head. I think it makes so much sense. Sorry for the rant though.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:24:55
What wiki is that? That isn't Gresham's Law. Gresham's Law is: "**When a government** overvalues one type of money and undervalues another, the undervalued money will leave the country or disappear from circulation into hoards, while the overvalued money will flood into circulation."[0]
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:10:52
Moving away from where I think bitcoin will be in 25 - 50 years from now...
I'm still not convinced inflationary currency is a bad thing. I think the encouraged spending is a good thing. The best way to evenly distribute wealth is through spending. The top 1% hording cash (which is one of the biggest problems today: wealth inequality) would only be worse with deflationary currency (in my opinion).
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:42:00
Why not? It encourages spending and investing. More businesses, more jobs, more everything. If you sit on your money all the time and only buy what you need apple wouldn't exist, microsoft wouldn't existm amazon might but it would be tough without investors (why invest when my momey gains value with no risk under my mattress?).
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:53:50
Haha yea, no one has all the answers especially when it comes to economics. I was just looking for some intelligent discussion to maybe spark an idea or a realization.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:07:18
My question is when there is a deflationary currency and an inflationary currency both available for use at the same time (bitcoin in its present state) why would I not keep all my money in btc and convert back to $ when I need to spend? Or are we assuming inflationary currencies will go away completely in this new utopia we are imaging.
Also, I don't quite understand what "time preference" has to do with deflation or inflation. A video game now and a video game 6 months from now are 2 different products. Some people want one, some the other.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:43:39
Bitcoin "mining" causes inflation same as gold mining caused inflation. Gold was inflationary at that time since new gold was constantly being found. Once it because deflationary it became an investment vehicle like it is now.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:38:45
Nope. I'd keep my savings in bitcoin and spend my dollars since they are losing value. Then when I want to spend more after I lose all my dollars I'd convert just the amount I need from btc to $ and spend that always keeping my savings in btc.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:42:08
20 - 30 years ago we said the same thing about computers taking all the jobs. Also it is actually hilarious how far away from Strong AI. AI is very good at specific tasks but not good at any sort general problem solving.


Who invests in dollars or euros? Very few people. The new BitflationCoin (patent pending) has to be accepted just like the dollar was: through government endorsement. Government can endorse something without controlling it. Like you said, bitcoin is a great means for investment not for spending.
PS: we have way too many threads going right now. I'm not answering all your other ones atm. Let's just continue in this one if that's cool.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:37:56
What's good for the people and what is in the government's best interest ~~rarely~~ don't always align. Less spending means less tax revenue.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:29:23
So "buying" USD with stocks sounds like spending to you?
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:00:23
Wait, I'm confused. Your first point doesn't seem to make sense since bitcoin (at the moment) is inflationary (technically).
Second, I can't remember the last time in history someone was out getting coffee or [insert other daily goods here] and spent a deflationary currency. Sure you can hoard gold (or another deflationary currency) to sell off later all at once in retirement or whatever but you don't spend it to buy things really. I mean hell. If I work in a store I'll sure as hell except the gold equivalent of whatever you're buying but you probably won't want to give me gold since it will be worth more soon.
Why not produce bitcoins for miners indefinitely. Inflation rate is controlled. No hyper inflation.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:56:58
Well disregarding the technological issue of having to wait 1 hour for a transaction to go through...
I'd say in an ideal world (in my opinion) there would be 2 currencies. One that is inflationary and one that is deflationary. Deflationary for investing, inflationary for spending. When your money is in deflationary money you have a small but close to negligible chance of losing it but the money increases in value over time. This deflationary money is available for people to try new things like starting a company. The inflationary money you have no chance of losing but decreases in value all the time so you are pressured to either spend it or invest in the deflationary currency (so other people can spend it, and you get a small return as a reward).
This is sort of how the world works right now with stocks and cash only the government and banks fuck up the inflation rate of cash by making bad investments or loaning too much money and then printing out a bunch more to cover their ass. If money wasn't allowed to be created by the government but instead introduced at a steady predictable rate I think a lot of these problems would go away.
In my mind, bitcoin fills the roll of investment money perfectly but there still needs to be pressure to spend or money will accumulate into a small few hands and not move around (no need to invest extra money since it will only increase in value). That's why I am investing in Bitcoin, however most people seem to think it has the potential to either be the only money (waaaay down the road) or take over as cash. Personally I don't think either if those will happen.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:00:27
No one keeps 5 mill in the bank. It goes into stocks (unless 5 mill petty cash to you and you're Zuckerberg rich).
Also no one wants their money to lose value but it is good for the system as a whole (in my and many others' option) if it does because this causes increased spending.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:06:11
I think it is a boon to savers and investors but not spenders. This would encourage people (especially the wealthy) to hoard their wealth not spend it. It seems like this hurts any company that doesn't sell food, clothing, and shelter. No?
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:49:40
Totally agree. My question is will it ever be used like cash is used today? If so why would anyone spend deflationary currency when inflationary currencies are available?
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:20:52
Companies wouldn't cease to exist, less companies would be created in the future if there were no inflationary money. Sure more companies would be created that offer potentially higher returns (since they would have to offer higher returns than the deflation rate or no one would invest) but most people just want safe returns. They don't want to convert their low risk/low reward lottery tickets (deflationary currency) to high risk/high reward lotto tickets.
Also I think I see the problem (maybe?): you're assuming no inflationary money exists in your examples. The fact is, there is inflationary money and people will always spend that before spending a deflationary money. Is that the disconnect? Do people think that eventually everyone will stop spending inflationary money and just make the switch to deflationary money? No people will want to get rid of it (spend it) while it still has value.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:30:30
Totally agree. All I was getting at was that btc will basically be a decentralized ATM at some point. I keep everything in btc and convert only what I need to $ when I need to buy something.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:07:55
Totally, but my point is I would never give BTC to a merchant when I have the option to pay in dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:51:32
Hyperinflation can be mitigated by controlled inflation. Just have bitcoin miners collect money for completing the next block indefinitely and you get inflation without the risk of hyper inflation.
Also, if I have a deflating currency and an inflating currency why wouldn't I use the deflating currency like a bank and convert (withdraw) only what I need to spend?
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:56:33
If every merchant accepted btc would you ever pay with btc as opposed to dollars? If so why? That's all I'm curious about.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:12:32


Sorry for being thick, I promise it isn't deliberate, but can you expand on this. Also, isn't the historical backing for that statement that gold is currently an investment vehicle? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:37:52
My original question was will bitcoin ever be more than a stock? In these examples we just went through it is not. It is a stock to keep money stored in but never spent with. (spent meaning giving directly to someone else for goods or services).
If I have 200 shares of apple stock, 20 btc, and $200 and the thing I want costs $150 what would you do? $300?
Obviously you would pay in $ and not in btc or stock.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:35:16
By "investment vehicle" I meant something you would never spend on goods/services but instead convert only what you need at the time to "normal" currency to spend keeping everything else in an "investment vehicle".
Circling back: Do you think btc will ever be more than a decentralized ATM (which is awesome btw)? Everyone keeping their money in btc and converting to $/€/£ to buy things?
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:02:32
Why? Bitcoin (as I see it) will eventually be a decentralized ATM once it stabilizes. You keep all your money in BTC until you need it, then you withdraw (convert) to your local currency to buy things. You would never give someone btc just like you would never give someone stocks as payment.
This is amazing. No ATM fees. No trading fees. Minimal transaction fees. The only thing you sacrifice is the security of a bank, which I'm sure there will be new "banks" that simply keep bitcoin data safe for a fee much smaller than traditional banks to store and convert your bitcoin for you when you need spending money.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:28:56
I love that idea. That's why I have some money invested in it. My question was: why is bitcoin deflationary if its overall goal is to replace cash? Cash by design decreases in value to encourage spending vs hoarding.
