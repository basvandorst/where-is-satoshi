What do you use to buy? I'm always sketched out about everything other than Coinbase. (US)

Note: Ledger uses a heirarchical deterministic wallet, simply meaning you have more than one address. Don't be alarmed when after receiving, the address has changed the next time you decide to receive more. 
You CAN reuse the addresses, they are forever tied to your private key. But it is not recommended due to privacy reasons.

wait, so have we concluded that the malware is changing the address when pasted? or is it possible to verify the address with a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano and then it still sends to the wrong address??

Found this, basically states that if you have a hardware wallet you have a much better chance of avoiding stuff like this even if you have the malware or a corrupt OS.

As far as KYC goes, if you send your coins off to multiple addresses then you can't really be traced, right? Because you could be using the coins to buy things, not necessarily selling, or moving to your own wallet. The only way the government knows when to look for taxes is when you use KYC enabled exchange to sell. Am I right in assuming this?

Where does one pick something like this up??
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:41:48
Right, so the question is, is there malware that can still change the address in the background not on the GUI level. 
So even when double checking on the ledger nano, after hitting send, it's able to alter the address and there is no way to stop it..

From what's being downloaded by Bitcoin Core?

I think this will work! The problem must have been that it couldn't read the HDD. I will try Linux Mint and let you know how it goes!

That makes sense... Do you know if I could unplug my RaspiPi HDD which is taking days to sync, and plug it into my computer instead to sync without restarting the download. Will it pick up where it left off since RaspiPi is running Bitcoin Core.
My computer says it can do the blockchain in a few hours compared to a few weeks using the Pi.

I guess what I'm not getting is how to continue the download on RaspiHDD. I'm at 60% but want to hook it up to my Windows 10 computer. When I do that (through USB) it asks to format it because the comp can't read it. So I'm not sure how to find out where to point the bitcoin core on my PC. If I just point it to the HDD I'm afraid it will just start over new and overwrite the 60% I've already completed.

What's the easiest/budget friendly way to build a full node?
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:29:13
Oh forgot about that. No, probably not. It has 1 TB of HDD space so I thought there might be a way to use it to support the Bitcoin network instead of it sitting in storage.
My thought was that it was low power, and had a HDD so it might be useful.

I've found the bitcoin.conf file and updated it to M directory where my RaspPiBlitz HDD is located. But when I restart Bitcoin Core it just continues loading into the HDD on my PC I specified early. I tried uninstalling the App but it never asks again.
 Is this command wrong? Going to try it in console of Bitcoin Core app as well now.
