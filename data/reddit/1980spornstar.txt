I was banished a couple of tens of times for saying that Bitcoin would collapse from 9 to 3

Again, I have no idea how your tech works. I can only tell you it's worth $0.
Andreas is basically a clinical moron.
The way money works is that it's either a Commodity, in which case it has intrinsic value.
Or it's either a Redemption Coupon, in which case it doesn't have intrinsic value but you have been credibly promised something when you present the certificate.

Schiff explains that Keynesianism is to economics as Astrology is to astronomy.
Keynes was a witchdoctor, he explains.

There is no need for maturation, just value.
If you somehow guaranteed that each bitcoin gets you 1/10th of an ounce of gold, that would provide a $120 floor

Easy, there will be no hyperbitcoinization

You have to understand the weight of Expertise.
I'm sure you are masterful at some geeky computer coding that you do.
But when you wish to know what your work is Worth, ask an economist (a different kind of specialist).
So, the likes of Nouriel Roubini have answered, that your work called Bitcoin is worth $00.00.
You were expert at crypto-encryptography tech, and he is expert at what that is worth.

Bitcoin also went from like 19 to 7 and then back to 11.
Fans said: "Yes! Finally we have won!"
Alas, bitcoin continued its descent to zero and beyond.
Leaving all bitcoin supporters behind, in the dust of poverty.

It did get banned. Anyway Craig Right made the aforementioned mistake when he invented bitcoin.
That is because he is a plumber (computer engineer) and not an economist

Bitcoin is not money, so the Fed can continue printing dollars undeterred.
In fact as Schiff warned, bitcoin is so sucky it makes the dollar look like Hercules
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:59:01
Did you refute any of my proofs. No.
The inventor of bitcoin basically didn't know the reason behind dollar's value. He ascribed it to a matter of habit.
"Let's switch the habit to bitcoin," he proposed.
Little did he know, the dollar's value was that it settled taxes. Bitcoin doesn't. So bitcoin goes to zero.

I'm extremely old, unlike yourself.
Why would my comments be "stupid and desperate" when the 90+% collapse I called for is happening

You basically expected to get rich by clicking "Buy" once.
Imagine a bunch of Eye Talians spending their whole life to craft a Lambo.
Why should they give it to some guy that watches Andreas Andronopolous

An alcoholic and a gambler. 
It looks like your mother shoulda given birth to a rock instead, so at least pigs could scratch their ass.

The actual flaw of bitcoin is the following.
Creators and buyers of bitcoin believed that the U.S. dollar is valuable for no reason.
So they decided that "nothing in particular" needed to be added to bitcoin in order to make it money.

I'm not a child you dolt. I just gave you the concise economic explanation why BTC is not money. It has no intrinsic value, plus you are promised nothing in terms of redemption value.
Gold is money because it has intrinsic value, and dollar is money because the Fed promises to lower your tax debt if you bring them dollars.
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:02:59
I already told you that currencies are based either on Commodity direct value (silver) or on tax credits (dollar).
When you have neither, then such a coin is worth nothing.

Yeah cryptoers basically expected to be given a million dollars for no reason.
Now they are getting the bad news that they will die in poverty.

I been bashing BTC since 2017
They told me I was some kind of out of touch boomer
But I knew I was Schiff 2.0 a.k.a. the greatest living economist
Just kidding, the greatest dead too

Institution just means "a bunch of people." Often, a bunch of crashy old people like a retirement fund.
Anyway, they are very conservative investors and would never risk a -90% crasher like BTC.
So "istatushanol ivestorz" is just a buzzword for bagholders

Dimon has 1 billion dollars
If he had bought Bitcoin when you recommended it, he would be almost as broke as you

You should sell at 2999 because that is higher than the pending 1999

How many of you can honestly say you had $2000 or whatever and then today $2500, i.e. a larger amount of physical cash thanks to bitcoin. (You withdrew it already in dollars.)
I would venture to say about None of you.
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:21:12
Low compared to what.
Bitcoin traded at 3 digits not too long ago.
Imagine it drops to $00.01 and you have a great idea to invest just $50 and walk away with $100,000,000 if it returns to ATH.
However after you do buy at $00.01 bitcoin drops further to $00.00001 and now you are a bagholder anew.
