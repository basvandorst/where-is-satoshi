I learned that I could not buy bitcoins at 55$ was hella pissed all my exchange service were fucked up in one way or another bitfloor, mtgox etc.. and my dumbass bought 10coins at 154 early this morning only way I could get them. But I just took all my money and Bought 70coins exactly at 6300$. that was at 90$ a piece from Silkroad... Vendor "twomuch"   went to the store to get moneypaks for his service. exchanged with him going all my coins in about 15minutes time as I did 3,000$ worth first then another 3,300$ worth. That was all my money I had to invest in this I will be spending some of course but Im sure when everything smooths out coins wil be over 200+ or 300+ within the week mtgox is coming up yea... About to kick some ass. GO BUY COINS from that vendor highly recommended if u are looking to buy low while u still can. He is at like 700 something coins left I think. But yeah. Good luck everyone.
