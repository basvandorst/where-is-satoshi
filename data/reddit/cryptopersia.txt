I'm genuinely trying to guess why someone might post sth like this.
Aside the usual suspects; troll, lier, delusional, etc, I'm leaning towards the birth of a fresh Nigerian prince, hoping to get private messages from other users asking for a handout..and then "send me 0.5BTC to "test" your address and I'll send you 5BTC"

I hope you realize he's the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway with other  shareholders owning more than 63% of it.
It's his JOB to maximize his shareholders' profit. So unless Berkshire buys into crypto, he HAS to bash it. This is not his experiencing talking. 
And since you can't teach an old dog new tricks, specially a successful one, don't wait for him to come around.

One more thing....to recover lost wallet on blockchain.info, it asks for a 12 word seed....why is everyone talking about a 24 word seed? if its 24, where's a good site to check it on?
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:03:07
I don't think institutions want to fill their bags at high prices so they "engineer" the dips. Doesn't take much for them to hire a FUD troll team, sponsor a main stream news segment or spend a bit of money to mess around with orders....With every dip, desperate investors sell, institutions buy

It seems like all these posts are coming from a universe that's stuck on loop. Like a daily glitch in the matrix.
The problem is that if Bcash minds its own business, it'll fade very quickly. So the never ending Bitcoin core posts, and why bcash is the real bitcoin. You might be surprised how little other people care and how small your bubble is.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:26:48
I realize that. I was trying to say that because a certain set of rules apply to all whether they like it or not, we can look at the banking system as one entity. Like you said, private banks don't have the power to question central bank's policies.
@_date: 2018-05-07 12:57:59
As far as I know central banks dictate the rules, fractional reserve ratios and penalties to the rest of the banks. So for the sake of this conversation I don't see why we should differentiate between them.
I have to admit I hold a grudge against banking since the preventable crash of 08. Although the banks were warned by various economists for a decade prior to the crash, they continued their predatory lending practices, made billions. Post crash, got bailed out like nothing had happened. Business as usual. Average joes got the short end of it.
I don't think bitcoin or any of today's cryptocurrencies are there yet, but we are on the right path or creating a permission-less, distributed ledger run on consensus. Transparent and verifiable transactions. How many times have governments, banks, DOD and others have admitted to misplaced and lost funds in millions!
IMO, crypto and blockchain is a disruptive and fortunately unstoppable technology that'll change our world.

Say you name your online store “cryptomerch”
You can get a NEO domain: cryptomerch.neo and and ETH domain: cryptomerch.eth
You then link your store’s NEO and ETH wallet addresses to these domains. If I was going to buy a T-shirt and pay you in NEO, I’d send NEO to cryptomerch.neo instead of a long blockchain address
Supposedly other web services will be available on NEO and ETH name services in the future. Idk seems like a nice touch and it appeals to these communities
Google both Neo Name Services and Etheruem Name Services and you can read more

My ideology in getting involved in crypto used to be financial freedom/revolt/banking the unbanked
It’s changed over time...aside utility tokens, all crypto currencies are investment vehicles for the early birds and the rich thus the volatility in price
As some of you said, people don’t want to rethink money, how it works and even change the name of their national currency that they’re used to....in this scenario only easy to use stablecoins can be adopted globally, which will essentially be the digitized version of national currencies
The sooner people realize this, the better. Gamblers, speculators and investors like us can play the crypto market just likes stocks for gains
Masses that are not interested in financial trading of any kind will not buy into this...simply cause they have no reason to.

Possibly obvious info, but doesn’t hurt to share:
Trading: 
1.learn about a few indicators: Bollinger bands,ADX, MACD, Stochastic RSI are my favourites - short videos on YouTube 
2.learn about various patterns: falling wedge, flag, etc.....short videos on YouTube
3.review historical charts for practice 
4.expose yourself to news outlets ( I prefer reddit and telegram channels ) - 
5.set “stop loss”  and sell targets - 
6.make sure you lock in profits along the way - greed is a bottomless pit
7.don’t get attached to trades as you’re not gonna make gains on every single one 
8. Cross your fingers and pray
(Plus the same principles of trading crypto applies to stocks-so it’s worth learning)

And brutal corrupt capitalism where the rich screw the poor, bail each other out, crush resistance, rinse and repeat
Communism? Where? How old are you?

Couple of years ago I left my leather folder in my car...the next day I saw my window smashed and folder gone...like u said police doesn’t and can’t follow up...there was nothing of value in there...I guess the thieves thought there might be a laptop.
Long story short, the next day I get a call from somebody, one block over saying he found my folder in his front lawn, saw my business card and called. The thieves stole my folder, walked over ONE street, opened it to reveal their reward, saw bunch of useless papers instead of the laptop and tossed it.
All I’m saying is that more than likely the notebook is dumped somewhere not too far from where your car was.
Local CCTV footage can help

Make sure you read on a few cases where ppl bought second hand ledgers (wrapped as new) and had their funds stolen.... one great way of learning what to do is by reading on what not to do

Using debt to buy a volatile asset is a bad idea...I wouldn’t recommend it

I got in 2 months before the ATH....I was very novice...I saw my investment in BTC and bunch of shitcoins go up by 10X....with all the hype, I thought it’s just the beginning and BTC will reach much higher highs.....then I saw my portfolio drop each day...but then you hope it’s a temporary retracement and it’ll pump again....you find out you were wrong each day, until you realize you’re in the red and selling at this point doesn’t make sense....that’s when you’re a born again Hodler and join the red portfolio cult
I made lots of other mistakes along the way....back in 2017 panic bought and sold on every “major news” release: stupid....jumped on a few icos: stupid....tried my luck with a fork: stupid..
On a positive note, I learned a lot, taught myself basics of trading and charting which lead to doubling of my most recent fiat investment in a span of 6 months

My criticism of extreme capitalism doesn’t mean I’m on board with socialism....it’s not black and white....don’t make stupid comments....I’m saying battling corrupt and extreme capitalism is also part of the struggle....I for one didn’t like how crash of 08 and it’s aftermath was handled....so let’s try to understand topics can have a wider spectrum than A or B...ok? Ok
