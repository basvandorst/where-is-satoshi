No I'm not that far yet.  Good to hear you were able to purchase.  I keep mine in Coinbase but that's definitely the basic basic

Downish

I really doubt there are many Dominicans here brah.  Did you google it?
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:55:31
Just use like google chrome
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:31:40
All the exchanges are so fucked.  Fucking Wall Street 
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:04:56
The fact that Coinbase will probably just take your money and not give you any coins before you can even get started
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:36:59
They're all way way way up long term but only bitcoin is a thing that gets used
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:30:43
Inside job brah.
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:45:34
Looks the same to me
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:32:23
The sites broken and if you are able to buy which you probably won't be then the purchase will be delayed or cancelled and your money may be stuck in limbo and customer support does not have the time or inclination to help you
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:31:08
That's really low right?
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:00:51
Has no one in this thread even looked at bitcoin lately?  You will never buy in at 800 lmao
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:50:57
Clearnet new account
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:01:46
It's holding pretty steady at 2k... I'd say buy now if you can figure out a way to do it
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:47:42
Are you using tor?  Don't use tor
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:00:07
The issue is technical not market based.  So many people can't buy
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:02:36
Price when you purchased.  FYI I'm not familiar w bitstamp.  And I'm using a bank acct so I was already waiting a few days
Edit:  I have no idea
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:01:07
Fuck inflation.  Healthy for who?
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:00:14
Memorial Day ho
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:01:13
Not sure about the vpn.  Don't know how they work
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:16:08
The price would still be going up if anyone could buy the fucking things
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:33:36
Technical meaning problems with the exchanges: delayed deliveries, inability to purchase, lack of customer support, disappearing transfers etc.  I think most people have been unable to buy for days now which is depressing the market
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:57:37
Can you link to something about storing offline or on your computer otherwise this is kind of a dick post just sayin.  Like what are you even talking about?
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:34:32
Basically the guy who is supposed to verify your identity is running around screaming dealing with other shit or possibly just getting high
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:25:43
Don't forget about all the people trapped into holding bitcoin whether they want to or not by criminal deposit delays
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:03:48
Probably Coinbase but don't go anywhere near their site till at least next week
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:10:34
As long as it doesn't act as some sort of proxy it should be fine but they will double check your information w that of your up address to see where you are
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:17:19
So you think Gemini is less evil?
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:40:49
We have the app dickhead
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:02:52
NEVER use Verizon.  Their website is so insecure it's laughable.  
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:28:56
You're sending like 10000 and the fee is like $2 so the correct answer is very very low
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:04:59
How expensive does that fee seem to you?
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:19:50
It probably has a target demographic that is unable to use most other exchanges but idk
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:27:29
Uhhhhhhhh yeah obviously just send it to their wallet wtf
