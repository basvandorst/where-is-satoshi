Precisely these.  I don't play WoW [for several years, at least] but I knew Blizzard began using them.  I also believe they employ an android [and presumably iPhone] app that does the same thing.
To me this seems like a way to easily prevent account compromise.  It may incur upfront cost on behalf of the service providers, but undoubtedly balances against the immeasurable damage to finances and reputation like mtGox is undoubtedly going to suffer.

FUckin' eh.  I didn't know that was a plausible thing.  Mind elaborating how?  Do you just put in your offer price and amount of BTC in the normal "trade" section?
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:33:59
Do you have to leave the window and mtgox open?

I just had a "Oh shit!" moment via my phone no more than an hour ago.
I'm a photographer, so I was at an event.  I had a lull so I checked my phone to see if my recent dwolla transfer had occurred.  It had.  I just, on  fluke, refreshed the page.  Suddenly there was 60 dollars in transactions that had taken place in the span of only a few seconds.  I QUICKLY removed all my dollars and bitcoins out of mtgox and changed my password.  What's the situation? 
I'm still on my phone and don't have the time to browse comments for an elaboration.  anyone mind sharing so I can read conveniently? =\

Word. Down for me, too.

Well, I hate to be that guy, but my transfer just arrived moments ago.  Email mtgox now.  They'll hopefully rectify the situation.

Thank you.  I'm sorry for the shitty timing of Dwolla and mtGox.  They gave me the run around for a couple of weeks too.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:56:46
Same.  Gladly changed my password to a much longer, severely random chain.

How did you manage to have an order pending.  Just set up the offer and see if it gets picked up?
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:10:24
Same boat, friend.  I'm sitting here furiously reloading the page hoping i'll see my deposit pop up.
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:40:08
I'm new to this. Sorry 
So presuming I recently put in two orders at a given price it will buy at those designated prices and amount until the order is filled?

Legitimate? 
Once burned, don't want my stuff thieved.
