Hmm now that you mention it I'm not sure.. JackExEck is listed on the bitcoin-otc site ( as well though and he is online on irc.freenode.net (as JackExEck).

I think it would be better to take this request to the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan  
They could just publish a statement acknowledging that BTC is widely used for Bitcoin transactions and state that they're reserving the code for that purpose.

I think that could be a problem.. probably best to contact the seller and ask first. UKash vouchers aren't all equivalent.. I read something in particular about german issued ones being restricted. I've been looking into this though and I think I might start selling BTC for UKash.. there's a site called  which allows you to use the UKash to top up a prepaid mastercard debit card which gives an easy way to close the loop. It seems like it should be possible to do this for a 5% fee and the fun part is you can do it totally anonymously.

damn that sucks :( maybe open an account at some other bank and use it only for bitcoins.. I've been thinking of getting an account at one of the channel islands banks (or maybe IOM or Gibraltar), I think they're on the same UK payment network (sortcode/account number faster payments etc) but some of them also offer free SEPA transfers to the EU.. it might be a good idea for people who intend to do a lot of bitcoin trading.

ahh. too bad.. freenode has a tor hidden service you could try;
you would need to download an IRC client that supports socks5 and set it up to use tor.. then connect to p4fsi4ockecnea7l.onion.
Maybe try xchat.org -- there's some info here;

There's one guy here accepting them;

You can probably do it with  - they seem to charge 3.99% for this 'service' though :/ You may also be able to purchase using dwolla on  or  Also  seems to take them.

The only way it could lower the price of BTC is if people lose interest in the currency because they can't mine it on their desktops anymore.. I don't really think that will happen though.. miners are already a tiny minority of the market participants.
