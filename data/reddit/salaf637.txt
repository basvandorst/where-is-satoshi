localbitcoins is not decentralized. They log ip's, and an ID can be uploaded.

Prob claimed some forked coins
@_date: 2019-11-11 10:08:27
So just send all BTC to other wallet and then use the seed from the wallet I sent btc from in exodus or coinomi to claim forked coins? :)
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:09:30
Tell me how to pay if Bitcoin is not accepted? I need to pay things and most of local shops accept fiat only
@_date: 2019-11-11 10:05:21
I have private keys for some wallets and phrases for some
@_date: 2019-11-20 11:21:45
But yeah, if there’s KYC not your coins.. Never use an exchange with kyc
@_date: 2019-11-16 09:50:04
Don’t have fiat
@_date: 2019-11-11 09:45:57
Okay�� I will not send my privatekeys for ever anyone tho
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:09:43

@_date: 2019-08-30 05:34:12
Hey, you can try localbitcoins.com
Or like Bitcoin ATMs 
@_date: 2019-10-23 06:38:53
Any service without id?
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:11:28
Depends where do you live. Many
people like me do accept CASH for BTC
@_date: 2019-02-26 08:25:28
It would be ok, then people would send coins somehow through reddit 
@_date: 2019-06-15 08:55:10
Just don’t use coinbase and you’ll be fine
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:44:53
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:36:29
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:23:53

@_date: 2019-09-26 18:10:02
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:25:03
��id is not an option
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:54:52
Bitcoin atm’s

@_date: 2019-05-22 12:44:08
Be your own bank.
It is sad but they do not need to give your money back
