No I didn't. This is you projecting some imaginary scenario that never happened. I didn't "flub" or "change" anything. I deliberately chose bitcoin.id as an example of a hypothetical domain. Like example.com.

It's not so much that they want to "be chiefs of their own fiefdom", it's that the Bitcoin oligarchy and core devs want none of what Vitalik wants. Their interests and visions intersect in some areas, but radically differ in others. Thus, fragmentation is inevitable, and a part of the evolutionary nature of software in general. This is actually a good thing for Bitcoin, because any sucess of Vitalik's will be seen, recognized, and likely imported back into Bitcoin (and if not, then his success will be Bitcoin's loss).

The term "double spending" should not be applied to RBF-replaced transactions.
The design of the system must allow for RBF, therefore its usage should be considered a normal, ordinary thing.
"Double-spending" should be reserved for transactions that have made it into at least one block.
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:55:51
Interesting, looks like GitHub did miss about 8 commits, but it doesn't change the fact that Hearn contributed almost nothing (comparatively speaking).
As [Matt points out]( Hearn did almost nothing. All of the giant LOC commits are things like copy/pasting a section from one file to another, or adding LevelDB.

I think the article misses something important about banks. It says:


No bank will allow "permissionless transactions".
Bitcoin [will scale]( to more txns/sec by the time the banks finish polishing their turd, and business will continue to go on as usual.
Lots of people will use R3's turd and be happy with it, and lots of others will use currencies like Bitcoin that will be cheaper, and won't come with big-brother or the idea of charging people for not having money.
@_date: 2016-03-05 19:36:21


That is, first of all, not true. That is not all the article says, you've repeatedly and dishonestly misrepresented what's written multiple times now.


- Dangerous: it's trivial for anyone to double-spend a 0-conf transaction. They were never intended to be relied upon. You will lose money. RBF/CPFP are *necessities* to prevent transactions from getting stuck.
- Incorrect: people who use 0-conf want to use Bitcoin for instant transactions. Well, that's too bad as Bitcoin **isn't designed for instant transactions.** If you want instant transactions, **use something else!** (Alternatives that work *with Bitcoin* are mentioned in the article.)
@_date: 2016-01-31 00:03:13
That doesn't matter. Node count dropped. Decentralization dropped. Those big blocks ain't going anywhere once they are created.

I don't know what you mean. You should read the various documents out there about what soft forks are and how they differ from hard forks (peter todd wrote one recently).
@_date: 2016-03-06 23:08:07


The dishonesty is reaching incredible proportions.
To [quote Peter Todd](


And to quote the post:


Here, even you can do it, [just use this script](
Without RBF, people's transactions will get stuck. And using [the blocksize to scale Bitcoin to VISA levels (the goal) is impossible]( so that's a redherring, don't bother bringing it up, it's been beaten to death.
@_date: 2016-03-09 01:17:07
Correct, this is a fundamental property due to the design of the system. To address this problem people are developing and using various off-chain solutions.
We must preserve decentralization (which is the property that keeps Bitcoin from turning into PayPal and VISA) while scaling Bitcoin. Some of the techniques for doing that are mentioned in the article.
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:16:37
Yes I read the article. Do you understand what payment channels are?
There is no meaningful limit to their scalability. Payments are done off-chain (see [lightning]( StrawPay, etc.).
@_date: 2016-01-17 05:53:26
Just an FYI, this is the Lightning Network code finally being made public. Here's hoping that they also get a freakin' blog and start communicating more with the wider public.
@_date: 2016-01-14 02:29:39


I don't believe that's true?
The 21M limit is a hard rule of the consensus, and if blocks are created that disrespect this rule the existing full nodes will not accept them.
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:42:47
That tool is obviously broken. According to it, Hearn contributed over 10 times the amount of code than Maxwell (no way that's right) and contributed 11 commits (when github shows he only contributed 3 commits). I looked at all of the code in the 3 commits that Hearn contributed, and it was a tiny amount. You can see on GitHub that he only changed about a hundred lines or so.
Neither by [additions]( nor [commits]( do the numbers come anywhere close to matching up.
I'm going to guess that it's this random unheardof tool that's this severely broken, and not GitHub.
EDIT: Asked a Core Dev about this and the reply I got: "Lol, there is no way in hell that's true"
Someone should let the "git fame" devs know that their tool is insanely broken.
@_date: 2016-01-30 09:37:32


Not really. Reducing the blocksize after a raise is more difficult than raising a blocksize after a reduction.
The reason is that full nodes are disappearing *now* and will continue to disappear. Every increase in blocksize simply accelerates that decrease in node count and it's unlikely you will get it back even if you then lower it again.
@_date: 2016-01-30 20:25:34

Nothing. The banks already have high-speed transactions without blockchains. Adding a "high-speed federated blockchain" to the mix is pure marketing that doesn't change their fundamental offering.
It will still be the same old centralized payment system we know and hate. The only real difference is that maybe instead of charging you $40 to send an international payment they'll charge you $5, and micropayments become feasible.
You still won't own your money, the banks will. You still won't be able to send arbitrary amounts. You still will have to abide by their arbitrary rules and pay their various fees. You still will have to request permission for an account and wait on hold to deal with their bullshit. And you're still using someone else's currency that a handful of people can print out of thin air and give to themselves.
Banks are banks. They are not Bitcoin. Adding a blockchain to them does not make them any less of the same nasty, power-hungry controlling entities that they are. It's still centralized. It's still fiat.
You don't come to Bitcoin because you want cheap international payments (although it gives you that). You come to Bitcoin for [the decentralization and all that it implies]( real ownership and control of your money.

@_date: 2016-01-22 05:27:35
Nice response, though I disagree. I think the article is actually pretty good, and so I will defend it.






Author said "practically impossible", not impossible, and throughout the article he uses the example of a catastrophe that causes everyone, in their own self interest, to change the protocol rules.
By his conception of what makes a "truly decentralized system" a "truly decentralized system", I would say it's a reasonable idea.






No, when he asks "who would make this signal", he means who would dictate that a change must be done?
Clearly if a system is decentralized nobody can dictate a change to it. Author is 100% correct on this. It doesn't matter if people can communicate, the point is that the system shouldn't change its behavior given an edict from some small part of it (and for "truly decentralized systems", even large parts of it).






You and the author seem to be in perfect agreement here.






Author is saying that in a "truly decentralized system", the protocol cannot be changed even by a majority, and he is right.
Take BitTorrent for example. BitTorrent is an example of a "truly decentralized system" (probably the best one I can think of) because it doesn't have any central points of failure and there is little "shared state" that its users have to come to consensus on.
Nobody, not even the author of BitTorrent, can change *the protocol* that the system uses.
He can certainly create a *new protocol*, and people can choose to adopt it or not, but he has no ability to impose his will on the system that exists out there already, and neither does a "majority" (well, I'm uncertain about that part, but to the extent that is true, the more decentralized the system/protocol is).
In Bitcoin, there is a (very large) shared state that users have to come to consensus on, and what's interesting is that it is *this shared state* that is a part of the protocol itself (talk about "data=code"!). The protocol itself defines what is considered "valid data" and what is not.
We run into a conflict in terms of Classic/Unlimited/XT, however, because what's "valid data" is intimately tied to *the word* "Bitcoin" in the minds of users. If there are two implementations of Bitcoin out there sharing different protocols, that means there are also two different "valid" datasets. But, all users have implicitly agreed that there is only *one* Bitcoin-the-currency. Hence the conflict.
If Classic were called "BitcoinClassicCoin" instead of "Bitcoin Classic Formerly-Known-As-Bitcoin" (while an existing Bitcoin is still around) there wouldn't be any problem.










Coins have nothing to do with the setup the author created. The author was talking about value, and value can be monetary or non-monetary.
What value do you get if Bitcoin were to do something dumb like switching to Classic? Well, I'm sure you can list off a bunch of reasons why you would want that to happen and how that would be valuable to you and others. That's what you get, that's what your "reward" would be.




Well, if you want to quantify something, you can. People have come up with ways of quantifying almost anything, even abstract emotions like happiness.






For two reasons:
1. That group of developers is taking a policy to stay with how the current system works. By the author's definition, if a system is completely decentralized its rules cannot be changed unless there's an emergency that causes *everyone* to act in their self interest to change the system. Clearly the position of the Core Developers fits this notion of decentralization.
2. The core developers respect [rough consensus]( for changing the protocol. This is a **requirement** for the developer side of the system to be considered decentralized. Bitcoin XT, for example, did not respect this and was [100% centralized in terms of its development team]( (that is what it means when you have a "Benevolent Dictator" capable of making arbitrary changes to the protocol).


This is complete and total nonsense. Systems tend to centralize, and the more they do the more difficult it is to uncentralize them. It usually requires a total political (and often messy) revolution.
There is most certainly something stopping "you from taking part in the vote and, perhaps, reinstating Blockstream". Notice how difficult it was for Bitcoin XT to attempt a coup of Bitcoin. Very difficult. The definition of centralization is the accrual of power in the hands of a smaller set of users of the system. Had Bitcoin XT succeeded, you can bet that they would have used their newly acquired powers to make additional changes that would make it even more difficult for users to change the meaning of "Bitcoin".


Changing the leadership does not, *at all*, on its own decentralize a system. What matters in terms of decentralization is how decentralized the leadership itself is.
In terms of Core vs. Classic vs. XT, Core is simply mathematically more decentralized in terms of its leadership, and there is no arguing with that. It comes out of the [definition of decentralization]( You can measure it by checking to see if rough consensus is employed by the leadership (if it's not it's centralized), and if it is then count the number of participants in that consensus.

apologies for not being abreast of this discussion until recently, but can you explain why *anyone* is talking about *specific* block sizes?
Surely [dynamic block sizes, determined by the network]( make way more sense than anything else?


Ethereum is considering using a "target uncle rate" (effectively, rate of orphaned blocks; "uncles" actually get some reward) to determine the block size.
To me, it seems like Ethereum is actually trying to *solve* the problem, instead of hack at it. When will Bitcoin take this approach? And if it is considering dynamic block sizes, then why is it that most people (including myself) don't hear these discussions?

Sounds like you're saying network/disk is not important but CPU/memory is, but you don't provide any reason for that.
What "we actually care about" is providing a good service while keeping it decentralized. Any one of those things, network/IO/CPU/memory are factors in decentralization, so they should all be considered.
But, I agree with the notion that block size limits are not the only way to scale Bitcoin, and I am wondering how much help the core devs are giving to to the Lightning network effort?

@_date: 2016-02-07 02:25:59


And the people here are very confused in their understanding of what decentralization is (no offense).
Many here seem to think that if there's "one project" like Bitcoin Core that it means that somehow development is centralized, when that is not at all the case.
Development for a single open source project can be either centralized or decentralized, it all depends on how the decision-making process is structured.
For example, all projects with a "benevolent dictator" are centralized because control over any decision ultimately falls upon one person, and one person only can change the project however they want.
That is not how Bitcoin Core works when it comes to what matters most: the consensus algorithm that powers Bitcoin.
Core follows, as best I can tell, the same [rough consensus]( governance model for modifying the consensus algorithm as the IETF uses. This is literally the governance model for how decisions that impact *how the Internet works* are made, and it is a *decentralized* model for two reasons:
1. It is an **open model.** Literally anyone with an email account can participate in the decision-making process in an IETF working group (provided they don't troll the conversation and understand what is going on), and the same is true for the discussions and decision-making that take place on the [bitcoin-dev] list.
2. No decision that impacts the critical functioning of the software can be made by any single person, and it requires more than a majority of the participants to agree.
This video explains [how to quantify Bitcoin's decentralization]( and [this post]( (by The Bit Ledger) and [this comment]( (by me) go into further detail.

But, I realized afterward what you meant to say there, so I edited the post and inserted the following which you did not see:
*The idea is that the canary updates stop, not continue. But you can equally achieve that without the periodicity by ceasing to pay for the upkeep of the website, or just pulling the plug on it, etc.*


By all means, instead listen to this dude who (I'm getting the feeling), doesn't even have a piece of software with a canary, nor is in possession of the required faculties of logic for creating one. Listen to him, the guy who's telling you to not stand up for your rights. That will get you far, I'm sure. ;)


I didn't say it was unsafe, I said it was harmful (to your users), and a pointless waste of time (for you). I have provided multiple rational justifications to that effect, and your assertion to the contrary just makes you sound foolish.

Speaking a security professional working on various security related software (and doing canary's since before they were cool), I can tell you that periodically updating canaries at fixed intervals [is a bad and unsustainable idea]( Canaries are great though.


This, on the other hand, is a legitimate WTF.

On hard forks in general, as per [the excellent rational here](
), and [here](
), hard forks should only come in response to some major crisis that virtually all participants can agree is an actual crisis.
Hard forks must be a *rare* world-is-ending-if-we-don’t-do-it thing (otherwise Bitcoin cannot be considered decentralized in any sense of the word), and if you're going to do one you should make the most of it. Be sure to address the real threats and challenges that are facing Bitcoin today:
1. Mining centralization.
2. Privacy.

I disagree with you do not have to "update your canary section of your site at least every 30 days".
We have a warrant canary on [our site]( as well (view source), and we do not update it every X days.
You don't need to (EDIT: and it would do more harm than good to do so, see edits).
(1) The government cannot force you to do anything against your will (it always, in the end, comes down to your decision to comply with them), and (2) it is *obvious* when open source software gets compromised.
- Do not need to update your software to insert backdoors. No government can force you to produce software, and if a government could, you've got way bigger problems than backdoors and it is all the more reason to not comply.
- Even if you did, in an open source piece of software a backdoor would be noticed, so the government isn't going to even try forcing you to do it. The worst they might try to do in terms of inserting a backdoor is sending a PR to your project (and hope you don't notice) or sending a PR to a dependency that you include in your software (and hope you don't notice).
EDIT: It turns out that periodically updating your warrant canary is even less useful than I thought it was. Government can always attempt to force you to give them write access to your website and have someone else updating your warrant canary for you.
EDIT2: Worse, periodic updates can lead to false positives and false panic if you lose your key or get in an accident or stuck at an airport or w/e.
So don't bother, it's a total waste of your time that would be better spent on development.

I'm well aware. Our website was one of the first to be listed.


No. Have it on your site, but don't update it at intervals. You are welcome to ignore my advice of course, but the consequences are then on you.


These situations happen all the time, and it's not about the site, but the keys to signing the message.
To ignore that would be, as you say, stupid.


Yes, that is what "key" means, and that is what we do. Anything else I would hardly consider a canary.


I think is perfectly capable of weighing both arguments and coming to a decision himself.
That said, subscribing to canary watch is a good idea.

I don't know how to put this more plainly, but the situation with canaries in coal mines (the actual birds), is not the same thing as with developers of open source software.
It's a nice analogy, but cling to it too tightly and you start to sound very silly.
When you're running your own open source project with a canary please feel free to come back here and we can have a more informed conversation.
@_date: 2016-02-05 22:31:43


Lol. I linked to it because it's right. Who cares about the upvotes and downvotes? They mean nothing.
If someone says something correct, and they get downvoted a bunch, all that means is either:
- A bunch of people are idiots (shouldn't be news to anyone)
- There's a bunch of sock puppetry going on (shouldn't be news to anyone)
OK, now let's go through your BS.


No they can't, just add a fourth scenario: threat of violence against you unless you get the 3rd party to comply.
You haven't achieved anything.


What good does that do? lol. OK, so now you've got totally pointless canary updates, and that's if you haven't been coerced into getting your friend to give them the key. It doesn't seem to me like you've thought this through.
The idea is that the canary updates *stop*, not continue. But you can equally achieve that without the periodicity by ceasing to pay for the upkeep of the website, or just pulling the plug on it, etc.
Meanwhile you've delayed release of the software itself, or possibly caused an unnecessary panic, and **definitely** wasted time you could've spent developing meaningful features.
The likelihood of getting served a gag order for an open source project? Minuscule (it's unheard of). The usefulness of periodic updates in dealing with a gag order? Nonexistent. The likelihood that you'll waste time or f*ck something up by doing periodic updates? Much greater than zero.
Jeez. What nonsense.
Anyway, at least in the United States, gag orders are unconstitutional. Feel free to stand up for your 1st Amendment rights.

@_date: 2016-02-06 01:18:48
Let's suppose the truth is somewhere in the middle (a small-to-modest, non-zero amount of miners switch based on the pool's stated preference), that:
1. Still leaves the core devs without a meaningful vote in the actual decision-making
2. And that still leaves all of those mining pool participants with only about **two** options to choose from (since mining pool operators will probably, in total, only offer two BIPs to vote on, similar to traditional [first-past-the-poll voting](
That's a fantastic recipe to take Bitcoin down the road to what will likely resemble the theatrics of American politics.
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:50:32


That "vital link" is a mechanism for making Bitcoin the slave of fiat, decreasing its value (in my eyes), not enhancing it.
As long as people are willing to trade fiat for a cryptocurrency, it is no better than fiat. If a few individuals have the ability to print money out of thin air (while the rest have to slave away for it), they can then trade that fiat for BTC and own it.
And when the same wealthy players today hold most of the BTC, don't be surprised when inequalities remain (or get worse), and the promise of Bitcoin is broken.
Only way to win is for people to stop playing their game, and that means giving our support to true decentralization.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:12:23
Yeah, it's not as bad as Soviet Russia in Bitcoin land (yet). I just see no reason to start walking back in that direction. On that note, here are two decentralized Bitcoin exchanges:
- 
- 
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:02:39


Sure, but that doesn't make them 100% centralized either.
(De)centralization is a spectrum.
1. Reddit and Lobste.rs are open source software that can be installed and run by anyone. That's a form of decentralization.
2. These platforms compete with each other, and in that sense I have a choice of which platform to use. In Soviet Russia, you had little choice. Soviet Russia was more centralized than Reddit.
That's all I meant.


I said the tech isn't there yet. In this context, "there" is reddit-like experience. Bitmessage is not only not there yet, but it's not even heading in that direction.
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:59:08


That's a nice myth. Sure, there are some examples of that (which get disproportionate coverage in media), but there are far more counter examples.
If you take actual producers of goods and services as a group, you will find that most of them have very little money. Only a tiny fraction of that group will make six figures or more.
Meanwhile, most of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of those whose primary skill is their ability to exploit others, and some don't even do that (they simply inherited it).
Those people do not return a proportionate amount of value to society. Some of them spend their time gambling (~~"high frequency trading", to sugar coat it~~ *Edit: I apologize for the poor comparison, while there are similarities with gambling, HFT, especially some types of HFT, is not identical to it*), or leveraging their position in some financial institution to make money from money, or from nothing. The great oil tycoons, while providing (somewhat questionable) value, make many orders of magnitude more than the actual people who are out there fetching the oil and refining it.
Most of "the people with all the money" have it not because they are producing goods and services, but because they've managed to exploit those who actually do, or they're in a position to exploit their own customers, or because they are able to obtain as much of it as they want thanks to their social proximity to a nearby printing press.


I don't expect Bitcoin to be the 'great equalizer', but I do think that what Satoshi started can lead to it.

I have accounts on Reddit, HackerNews, Lobste.rs, and others. These platforms are already fairly decentralized. The tech to completely decentralize them isn't there yet. As soon as it is, I won't preach, because I'd be preaching to the choir.

Just don't use centralized services. Period. Doesn't matter where you are. They are antithetical to what Bitcoin is trying to accomplish.

We share some things in common with the Borg, but at a scale level up. They too have a central brain (the queen) that commands absolute; their drones are our bacteria &amp; cells, etc.
The Borg and the human body have both centralized and decentralized components. It's interesting to think about.
How can we decentralize the human brain? In some ways we are doing that right now thanks to the Internet. That way, someone's knowledge doesn't get lost forever if their brain stops functioning.

Because it fits [the definition](
*Gambling is the wagering of money or something of material value (referred to as "the stakes") on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning additional money and/or material goods*


For example, borrowing millions (billions?) at 0% interest and gambling with it, then forcing other (completely unrelated) people [to cover their losses]( Not a luxury 99.99% of the planet can afford.


Just a convenient example.

We don't need to rely on centralized services to safely store bitcoin.
End users can safely store bitcoin, no disaster needs to take place.
There are mechanisms for doing this:
- Backups
- Multisig
- Shamir secret sharing
- Threshold signatures
- Steganography
Forget your password? Lose your devices? Doesn't matter, your friends will help you out.
I'd rather rely on my friends than on random strangers whose only interest is to extract money out of me and as many people as possible.
If I have no friends, a backup of some sort will work just as well and will take less time to setup than an account on Coinbase.

**It's very unlikely there will _be_ "non-SegWit bitcoin".**
The idea that there will be is a narrative that needs to be nipped in the butt before too many people are mislead.
The reason is two-fold:
1. [replay attacks](
2. The fact that SegWit is a soft-fork, not a hard-fork, and therefore the BIP148-side can overwrite the non-148 side
Everything you do on one chain [will be mirrored on the other]( so there won't really be two separate coins.
To prevent this, apparently you need to [double-spend your coins to self]( something that few are likely to be able to do, and something that exchanges are unlikely to do because the entire point of Bitcoin is to prevent double-spending in a decentralized way.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:09:07


So you're choosing to knowingly mislead people? Pretty sh*tty move.

@_date: 2017-06-03 18:55:49


I don't expect anyone to go through that, even if it's done for them, but let's say 5% diehard UASFers do, I expect even fewer will be willing to sell their legacy coins while the legacy chain remains longer. So, 0.1% of ~5% = 0.005% of ~~users~~ diehard UASFers might do this.
Encouraging people to sell their Bitcoins under such uncertain circumstances is basically fraud / theft.
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:53:11


These are not the same thing for the reasons explained above [and elsewhere](

Yes, and a lot of people lost money because of that. It wasn't until after people figured out what was going on and most of the coins were split that ETC really became its own thing. The exchanges began splitting coins for people. That is unlikely to happen here, because the method(s) for doing so are not nearly as simple or reliable.
