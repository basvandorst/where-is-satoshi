Have fun.
Ed.: I'll admit I was wrong above - they don't create money by FRB, they create money by balancing new loans.

Yeah, this. Admittedly, I'm a bit bitter about not getting onto the hype train back in 2011, but following this community is quite hilarious.

The reasons for failure of the Ost-Block were not that much economic, it was more about totalitarianism. Again, I've seen this many times since moving to the UK, the common misconception is that "communism (by which they mean Stalinism) is bad because everyone wants everything for free", rather than the true reasons why my parents decided to fuck it in 1989 - lack of freedoms.

The £10 in your bank account has nothing to do with "real" fiat money. It's all bank credits, which can be converted into currency (coins and banknotes), provided that your bank stocks enough.
A £10 banknote (or a £1 coin), issued (basically) by the State, is redeemable for another £10 banknote, in perpetuity. Pretty much the only "real" value that piece of paper has is that the Bank of England promises to provide you a new paper, should your old one get damaged or get recalled.
Obviously, the value comes from people (and the State) willing to accept it for services.
The Bank of England had a few excellent articles on money-creation in current society.

I thought you're a bot, but you can actually write!
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:51:53
Because it's easier?

The suffix actually doesn't matter at all. If you run "file" on that file, you'll know what it is. And if you won't don't open it.

Since when is "predicting" a "guarantee"?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:47:10


I thought that was gold.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:56:04


No dude. It's a saying which is true, not "almost true". But that's not the point.
My point was, the sentence above is a non-sequitur. A prediction implies probability, which conflicts with a guarantee.

You know it's incredibly difficult to live in Switzerland as a foreigner? Even if you have a job, you undergo so much scrutiny, for example when renting a flat...

Why is it problematic? If you earn ~$50k doing actual work, you have to pay income tax too, why should this be exempt?

If it goes back to below $200, I'm in. Promise.

Thanks, that was an excellent, informative post. Have a cookie.
Unfortunately, it's falling on deaf ears - I believe (somewhat blindly) that taxation is necessary, and while I don't think that currently the tax system in the UK is set up well, I don't generally see anything wrong with the idea, and I'm too "busy" to educate myself otherwise.

Fair enough.
