You don't have to give them the whole block. In fact, the Getwork protocol doesn't. Obviously getwork itself is too slow, but it's easy to come up with a similar custom protocol.
A custom protocol would let the miners know that it isn't just a standard pool, but the increased payment would encourage them to participate anyway. And there's nothing they can do to hurt the pool itself other than not participating (and thus hurting their own profits).

@_date: 2014-01-24 03:22:55
You're assuming that fair weather mining is possible, but I don't think it is.
I'll admit that I misremembered the block structure, so designing a blind getwork protocol is slightly harder than I initially anticipated, but it's still possible. The fact that SHA256 uses the Merkle–Damgård construction means that you only need to know the hash of the first 64 bytes of the message to compute the hash of the entire message, so there's no need to send hashPrevBlock to the miner. 
Also, not sure what you meant about difficulty adjustment. Difficulty adjustment is not a problem, in fact the selfish mining strategy relies on it for profitability.

Yes, but to get an accurate comparison of fees, it makes sense to do a second transaction the other direction. It's a lot easier to compare when you start and end with the same currency, even if it's not realistic.

Actually, you can't, because blocks in the public chain don't become fixed until they're mined. 
The pool can add a secret dummy transaction to the work in progress block before sending it to the miners. It will be accepted into the public chain if successful, but there's no way to match the hash.

@_date: 2014-12-21 04:41:47
I don't consider myself a troll, but it is an interesting question why I'm opposed to bitcoin. I think there are a lot of factors.
One factor is the environmental costs of all that electricity being burned for nothing. After thinking about it more, I've realized that bitcoin is providing a service by allowing things like Silk Road to exist. But it's not clear that this is a service which should be provided, let alone worth the costs of running it.
Another factor early on was economic. A deflationary currency would be a disaster, so I didn't want bitcoin to become the main currency. Luckily, after learning more about bitcoin, I realized that it won't take off and it can't take off in its current form, so this is no longer a real concern to me.  
But another major factor is that so many bitcoin proponents are based on rather *odd* beliefs. It's just funny to watch them, and since the bubble burst, there's been a fair amount of schadenfreude too.
Anyway, that's just my own views. I'm sure everyone has their own reason for thinking whatever they think. I think it would be interesting to turn the question around. Why are you pro-bitcoin? I could write a similar post as yours, but I think it is patronizing. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 07:29:38

This paper isn't about the Fed specifically, but it makes the case for higher inflation targets in general, so you might find it interesting.
(Technically, it's possible to target inflation in a cryptocurrency too, but without a central bank, you have to build it into the protocol. And Bitcoin has built in deflation, which would make it an economic disaster if it ever became widespread. Ironically, this is commonly cited by bitcoin proponents as an advantage.)
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:33:42
Perhaps a bunch of traders will get together and establish a body to oversee financial institutions to make sure that they don't openly scam everyone. And since everyone benefits from it, it will need to collect fees from everyone forcibly to prevent the free rider problem. Then to ensure accountability, they could have a system where people periodically vote on who should be on this commission. And to give it real teeth, set up police so it can actually enforce punishment against bad actors. And then a court system to limit abuse by the police and adjudicate disputes.
The free market solves everything.

That actually doesn't bypass the 21 mil limit. You can only move coins from the aux chain back to the original chain if there are UTXOs available on the main chain.
Like I said, it's impossible to ever have more than 21 mil coins available on the old chain. Otherwise it wouldn't be a softfork by definition.

There's almost an infinite number of possible disasters. If you asked people whether they cared about the possibility of an alien invasion, they'd say yes but that doesn't mean they're going to prepare for one.
When I said care, I meant that it is a worry in their day to day life, not a possibility they would worry about if you specifically asked them about it, because the later is true of almost anything.

Based on the comments I read here, most Bitcoiners seem to treat it as a speculative asset as well.

@_date: 2015-08-15 07:22:22
If mining becomes unprofitable (which it will) the most likely outcome is that a large number of miners drop out and transaction fees increase.
(Short term) supply depends on the entire stock of bitcoins, not the rate at which new bitcoins are being produced, so there's no reason to expect a price increase purely on a supply and demand basis. A speculative bubble is quite likely though.

As I understand it, BIP100 replaces the hardcoded block size limit with a floating limit based on voting by miners. This means that 21% of miners can set the block size limit arbitrarily low.
Is there any reason they wouldn't just immediately set it really low, even below 1mb? Even today, blocks are mined less than 1mb. Miners care more about their bandwidth costs then minuscule transaction fees, so there's no particular reason for them to want large blocks.
