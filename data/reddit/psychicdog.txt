As usual, the only thing anyone cares about in this sub is the price of Bitcoin. Yay, buy buy buy.  
I don't like this at all. We now have the head of our government taking a negative stance against Bitcoin. I don't think there is anything the govt can do to squash BTC but they could certainly make using it and life revolving around it more difficult.  
Earlier today I was sitting at a fast food restaurant with my parents and 4 cops came in and sat down next to us. Bitcoin was one of the topics discussed and I wasn't afraid to speak openly and loudly about it. Now imagine a world one year from now, where Trump has become hellbent on outlawing Bitcoin and all use of it has been made illegal. I wouldn't even have dared whisper to my parents about how well BTC is doing and how mine is spread across multiple sportsbooks, poker sites, wallets, and exchanges.

Ladies and gentlemen, our government. It subsists only to funnel money out of the private sector and into valueless tasks in the public sector performed by human leeches.

On the rare instance I talk about BTC irl, I always say “Buttcoin.” Forget where I first saw it but it made me lol years ago. Cool that there’s a sub dedicated to hating on it, but not surprised. 
These people are actually so out of touch - blockchain is “a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist” and it’s nice “if you live in Iran or China only.” Uhm, I’ve been gambling for a living for 15 years here in the USA, and I can’t even begin to tell you how insanely good adoption of BTC has been for me and moving my money around/cashing out on the Internet. 
Not the first BTC trolls I’ve run into, and I love that it’s so popular that know-it-alls can’t help themselves from shitting on it thereby increasing discussion/knowledge of BTC.

Gambling is in the same grey area throughout all of the US after a bill passed in 2006 called UIGEA - Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act. This bill doesn’t make it illegal for the player to gamble, but rather attempts to prevent US banks from doing business with offshore gambling sites. Gambling is nice and legal throughout most of the rest of the world except some SEAPAC including the poker sites and sportsbooks I use. Note: things are changing a bit in some states last 2 years especially around sports betting.
Pre-UIGEA, you’d use a site like Neteller to cash money out to your bank account, or a wire transfer, or a check in the mail. There were all sorts of problems with this as you might imagine. Slow, banks didn’t want to be involved, etc. I personally used Bank of America at the time and didn’t have too many issues but anytime you were cashing out you’d check a thread where everyone reported the status of their cash outs and speculate about what was going on between 3rd party payment processors and the US banks.
Neteller pulled out of the US market after UIGEA, things have been more difficult since.
I could write a novel about all this and genuinely enjoy talking about it so I’ll just try to wrap up.
BTC is a godsend and works better than Neteller ever did. Lower fees, too. 
Buying in to the site is usually done with credit cards. I’ve never had a problem but I’ve made very few deposits so can’t really say, it’s kind of a coinflip apparently whether they work. But BTC has helped here too, the amount of poker players online is trending upwards again after “Black Friday” April 2011 when the US government for the first time enforced the UIGEA. Bitcoin helps people get money in and definitely makes it easier getting it out.
Facts aside and now my opinion: Bitcoin is indeed excellent at subverting the draconian laws of governments. And govt in the Western world can fuck up liberty as well as any 3rd world country.

Hey man, I really appreciate this response. Thought I typed everything out for nothing. Agreed with everything you said re: traditional banking system being better (currently), but I have no faith in any kind of policy changes and as a libertarian-anarchist I'm kind of too bias to analyze it beyond that and my eyes kind of glossed over what you said on democratic processes. Also disagree 100% about the crackdowns, it'll be as effective as combating online piracy.  
As I often find to be the case, we both see the same problem, but I think we disagree about how it came to be, and thus, will disagree about the solution.  
Again thanks for the reply and my final note is: at the end of the day, I don't care if BTC is worth 1 USD or a million, as long as I can effectively use/convert it to a medium of exchange.

All value is derived from social consensus. Except the dollar, which is mandated at gunpoint.
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:04:49
I believe in Bitcoin because others do. Value is purely subjective and enough people are fiercely interested in it and always will be.
