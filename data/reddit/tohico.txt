Would be nice. Still waiting on their solution before becoming angry about it.

I'm sure they will learn from their mistakes. Their future stands more on what they're going to do with this now. Socializing sounds reasonable to me, although it still depends on the details as well as their standpoint on the loss alone.
If it all goes well and reasonable, I'm expecting to continue using Bitfinex. I just have to start using multiple exchanges at once in order to not keep everything on only one exchange.

Thank you for your reply. That's very unfortunate considering the way those additional funds were obtained.

Bitfinex, it's really great for margin trading ...oh, wait. Oh, no! Sh*t!

Any tips for an extension that would clearly mark up those posts that are links and not posts?

What do you mean? I'm not blaming anyone nor have any anger towards anyone.
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:58:24
I like that! I've never thought of it in this way. Thank you for sharing this strategy with me.

I was worried about the decline, so I sent everything there in order to exchange it for fiat and then use it in margin funding for a few days.
Plus I considered Bitfinex as super-safe, at least from the user's end. I like their safety features which I'm rocking all of them. I never expected such breach from their side, in fact, I even thought they were putting the bitcoins in freezers like everyone else. I know, silly me, I'm new to this...

My story went something like this:
* Week 1: Getting into btc in order to spread my investments and make it all safer.
* Week 2: Finding about Bitfinex, liking the safety features and low fees. Switching all my btc operations to them.
* Week 3: I like the super-safe margin funding, getting more btc and depositing it on Bitfinex.
* Week 4: GGWP

And is it based off the time of the breach or closing the market? I was closing my long positions as well as exchanging all my btc to fiat earlier today, so it leaves me worried.
I also send there more btc right before they shut down, so not sure what's going to happen there as well... It was after the breach took place, I'm just wondering what Bitfinex is going to do with it.

We weren't even able to operate with those funds. The system never registered them, even if the transaction had plenty of confirmations.


Yep, I have the same view on this. Socializing all funds seem as the most moral thing to do at this moment. If the cut is still reasonable as predictions are pointing to (20-30%), then I think it's something everyone can live with. Especially if they're going to repay the losses over the years from their profits.
This would at least help those with losses that are devastating for them personally, their families and those that are even thinking about suicides as mentioned in other posts...

Thank you, I'm glad to hear that. It's obvious how I feel about it, but I still believe the situation was created just by a mistake which is fully understandable in such situations. Therefore your standpoint is what matters the most in this issue.

Have you discussed with others the situation of additional btc deposits that were made after you noticed the security breach and closed down registering those deposits in the system?
You've already given me your standpoint on this before, but I'm wondering whether this was later discussed in meetings; especially in regards of socializing the funds.

Hey Zane what’s going to happen to btc deposits that were made after Bitfinex closed down deposits in the system while the market was still operating? Will there be any special treatment for this in general?
I feel misled in this regard since the deposits and withdrawals were closed – the system would never register them and yet, customers were freely allowed to made the deposits though the site and weren’t even warn about anything. This basically led into automatically freezing all the additional funds which end up for us in even greater losses since the market crashed right after the Bitfinex closed. And now, we’re worried what’s even going to happen with those questionably obtained deposits.
So here’s my question. Will there be any special treatments to those late deposits? Like priority for withdrawal when this goes up, withdrawal before it goes up, etc. And in case of socializing funds or insolvency, will those late deposits be used for it as well?

Awesome, that's completely solving my struggle. Thank you for explaining it to me.
@_date: 2016-07-21 01:32:40
Regarding the first point, what's considered as the safe amount of transaction to do within one address? And are we talking purely about outgoing transactions or incoming ones as well?
@_date: 2016-07-24 06:06:32
And does this compromise funds on the reused address or the whole wallet?
@_date: 2016-07-21 02:01:14
Yep, same here, and also related post:
