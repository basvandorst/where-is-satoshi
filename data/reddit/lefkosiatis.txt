I attended the Neo &amp; Bee event on February the 24th in Nicosia.
The University's CFO was there as well. 
He is the most inspirational presenter and when he was talking about Bitcoin, he described it as "mankind's most important technological development of the last 20 years".

I called them and confirmed. 
Participants who take and pass the asessment, get a certificate and ECTS.

Cryptocyprus do you know him personally?
Can you ask him to do a Reddit AMA to ask him about the developments in Cyprus, the MOOC course at the University, the Master's degree, his opinion about BTC e.t.c.?

Tell him to go for a plastic surgery. 
This article will make him the most WANTED man on the planet. From mafia to FBI agents, to drug cartels and private armies.
He is in serious trouble.

Is the company open? I've passed outside and the branch is closed 2-3 weeks now.
IS anybody in the offices?

 Xenofondos should stand a trial and be jailed for destroying tens of thousands of families. Instead he is out and dares to make comments for bitcoin. This is what happens when thieves and scoundrels remain unpunished.

Is Cyprus included in the 139 countries?

Guys one question:
The company raised 9,400 Bitcoins. Brewster said all are accounted for.
From your statement the CFO doesn't have a clue of the exact financial situation.
How many Bitcoins are accounted for so that we can derive how many Brewster took away?

how can one see that mate?

The Neo guy didn't even have a degree, stupid!
If you lost money from him, then "stupid square":)

When you have ECTS from an accredited University they count all over Europe and, by extrapolation, all over the world.

Trading on Havelock disrupted once again. This place is awful, full of shit.

The Mt.Cox bullshit had damaged the launch of Neo &amp; Bee.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:11:47
Bravo to Neo Bee.

The MOOC is taught by these 3 guys.
The MSc is taught by a team of 14 professors:

If he DID say 
“I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection"
then ITS HIM!!

On the Euro side of things, how much can the CFO account for?

When will they announce?
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:14:22
There is an estimated 7 billion euros in houses, under matresses!!

That was a shock!
I congratulate you both George and Oystein for speaking the truth.
Especially shocking are these words: 
**the mistruths and outright lies being fed to investors, creditors and the public**
**We were misled and the truth was obfuscated from us under so many layers, that combined with our workload, proved enough to allow the CEO to run rampant, without accountability and with full control of all the bitcoins, until it was too late**

Had there not been the Mt.Cox bullshit and the Havelock collapse yesterday, the price would have easily been 0.01 BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:42:51
Wow. Very cool!

There is 0% capital gains tax on the sale of shares, securities, financial instruments etc.
If BTC is classified as in Germany (financial instrument) there will be NO CGT on Bitcoins either.
