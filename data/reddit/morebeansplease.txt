Mr CEO I read that in a whole different light.  Lets review what we know about corporations, they are machines designed to make money, true, and their happy spot is when they have a monopoly and don't have to compete to make money, also true.  You framed the critical concern here as solvency, which might be a current battle.  But what are operational costs between your two organizations?  Oh thats right, Coinbase has higher operational costs because "The industry needs rock solid infrastructure to enable people to convert their local currency into and out of digital currency.", we shouldn't be comparing the two.  But the problem I see here is that the rock solid infrastructure is the blockchain, the externals should be shifting rapidly in this age of innovation.  You are selling the dream of corporate control and speculators are betting you will get it.  In your board meetings with investors how much money are you projected to make off the bitcoin market over the next 3, 5, 7 years, when does the plan say to stop making money?  When do your projections end and what happens then, does coinbase become a parasite leeching the system dry like every other corporation before it?  I don't have full information on this but my impression as an outsider is that Coinbase doesn't own the blockchain, its just a vendor selling luxury access.
Also, I am a mostly satisfied customer of Coinbase.

C'mon man, can you quit acting like an American for just a moment.  The NSA gets paid to break encryption.  The most important key to winning a war is communication.  The faster you coordinate the greater your advantage.  On the other side, the more you know about the enemies troop movements the better your reaction to them will be.  If you are at war the most effective weapon against the enemy is to hack their communication.  Seriously check out code breaking in ww2 (German enigma machine, Japan Purple/Red, US Codetalkers, Russian wait the Russians are stupid they didnt even have maps).  This whole military organization wakes up every day and earns a paycheck by hacking encryption.  
In short the NSA has billions of dollars and hires the best mathematicians in the world to break encryption.  Bitcoin uses encryption to keep itself secure.

Its not about trust, its about strategic decisions.  Just because you have something strong and smart doesnt make it invincible.  At no point am I advocating opening up administration or control of Bitcoin by any government.


Didnt realize you were one of the builders... regardless, I havent seen any evidence that you are in a position or even competent to start judging what I do and dont understand.

Independence makes you feel free but it is merely a temporary symptom, nobody and nothing are truly independent.  Transparency is how you balance the playing field, this is your tool, this is your the cause that will create symptoms of freedom and truth.

You say good and bad is if they were separate objects from humanity, they are in fact both pieces of the same humanity.  If you speak of humanity and expect only the good or the bad to show up you have already lost.  The focus should be on our ability to prevent the "bad" from disrupting the goals of bitcoin.  We maintain the integrity of bitcoin through a mechanism called security.  Encryption is one piece of that security but the most important piece is the open doors.  Everyone and anyone can check the ledger, corruption has no place to hide here.  I would suggest your energy is better spent accepting both the goods and the bads of humanity. If you then chose to accept that bitcoin is an advantageous way forward pay attention to how it actually works not how some of the people use it.  These so called "bad" people are testing bitcoin and will never stop either making bitcoin stronger or killing it.  The point of concern is about whether or not bitcoin deserves to survive, that has yet to be proven.

Where are our thresholds for performance degradation?  I would guess this has normative operating boundaries (green) with peaks (yellow, acceptable) and spikes (red) thresholds.
What is the best growth pattern that our performance data supports?  I would guess there are different workloads and therefore different optimal responses.  When do we respond with increased processing (adjust  miners), when do we respond to network latency (adjust regional processing, if even an option) and when do we respond to block size (adjust block, up or down)?
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:04:54


Significantly lower, which implies that transaction spam is powerful and should not be left unchecked.  Are there fixes in the works for this one?




If the block needs to be processed then at any given time you may have sufficient, insufficient or too much processing resources.  Which measurements would we use to identify and what is the best practice to react?


A big deal for sure, do we have measurements for that?  What solutions are being discussed?


Agreed, that's why I put in there that it may be an option to reduce the block size, its easy to lose the full scope. 


I don't fully understand this yet, but that seems to be the highest priority..?  Are there any significant counter solutions?

By design, yes, there is intentional inflation of the US dollar to provoke economic activity.


Isnt it more correct to say that Bitcoin will correct or deflate an inflated currency.  Once the value has been corrected any deflation/inflation will be caused by economic growth/shrink instead of by the currency(bitcoin) itself.  


Its not that one needs to artificially create more, its about the ease of lending, the reduced cost of lending, that comes with being able to create more.  I would suspect that a side effect would be the cost of lending money goes up.

A bank is a financial institution licensed to receive deposits and make loans. Banks may also provide financial services, such as wealth management, currency exchange and safe deposit boxes. There are two types of banks: commercial/retail banks and investment banks. In most countries, banks are regulated by the national government or central bank.

1 is not available to Bitcoin long-term, because debasement is halving every four years.
2 penalizes economic activity, which is more important than burying money, ahem saving. Also it doesn't scale, unless it is uniform in the protocol. Gavin wrote making it uniform won't work in the market.

Im asking about intentions or expectations of the future, when the current mining incentives are gone.
@_date: 2015-10-09 15:26:54
Can I ask how much you payed for the miners, such a small payout as well, rough deal.

Ouch, are we all smug pricks now?  I've only been doing this for four years now am I already in the out crowd?

1 out 8 Americans are from Cali, its a melting pot.
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:03:20
Why is this a good idea?
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:57:20
Yeah, that's certainly part of the ingredients.

It sounds like those are lobbyist tactics.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:07:12
ah, good note, I will check that.

I have a tough accountant...
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:32:26
Ah the price is low, that means its time to buy.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:08:17
Agreed, at this point its more about making it into a fun story than actually getting rich.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:26:26
Yeah, I got a good one.  But with money a little "tight" I am forced to justify my spending.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:01:25
Yes and lots of fun watching it go up.  But where to stop?  How far will this ride go?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:57:27
Was just there, you are correct.  First, I have to check my coin version to see if its the one with an error and buy one of those protective coin cases.  I appreciate the offer, but not yet, lets see where she is next year.

Its not like I am trying to make a reddit spectacle out of the thing.  I was hoping for some real advice.  Do we know how big this thing will get?
