Seems most of these dips happen when something happens in Asia. Is there a news source we can follow to see what goes on over there? 
My alt coins started falling last night, exactly when the Asians started waking up.

I JUST bought eth and it got approved in 5 mins. The transfer to binance took another 5 mins.

If you don't have an option to cash out and you notice most alt coins are going down, which coin is safe to transfer in other than bitcoin?

I got an answer on Alt coins accept both BTC and ETH and I just wasn't sure why.

Can anyone predict if BTC will ever stop fluctuating in price? I hate treating digital currency like a stock market.
