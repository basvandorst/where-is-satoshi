Yes, plan is to buy there for low or no fee and move to wallet. Haven't picked a wallet yet....
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:53:27
Yeah, thats the plan most likely. Its just the case of which one. I'll research tomorrow and have one ordered on Amazon by the end of the weekend im sure.

Meaning what?
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:31:41
Thanks, biggest question now is which wallet to use. I plan on buying both Bitcoin and Ethereum at least $5k to start and will increase from there. I am torn between a few different options and there are ridiculous amounts of reviews on why one is better than others.

I am awaiting some artist markers landing from China in a few weeks and intend to setup ability for purchases in a variety of crypto which would be much more exciting than just sending them all in to Amazon to sell them. Can't wait ��

Open an ally.com bank account and transfer money there. Ally.com doesnt care if you send money to buy crypto ;)

I ALMOST did the same. Wouldn't let myself do it though luckily.

Now to hope for a small Sunday night weekend dip to buy some more ;)

He was making multiple transactions as well, I didn't get a chance to see the price it was charging but had to have been north of $5400 with fees.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:07:40
Yeah, point of ach deposit is to send to gdax and buy with zero fees. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:51:59
If you send to deposit then you get the cash 7 days later and can buy from gdax with zero fees. If you click on buy bitcoin from coinbase with no funds available it will pull from from your ach account and buy at the market price at that moment plus 2.5% fee but you won't have access to the coins for 5-7 days. In a rising market the 2.5% fee is worth it, in a rough market like this its scary as if it crashes you can't do anything about it till you get the coins a week later.

If you sign up for an account and join waitlist now via a current user code you get a free share of stock up to $500 worth by opening up a trading account. Pm me if you want to use my code, if you sign up on your own you get nothing. Didn't want to post it here for drama that comes with that. I've received about $50 in free shares that I'm going to sell and trade for ETH or BTC when it goes live for trading.

Aaaand then its back down... Doesn't count if it doesn't stay there ;) 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:50:09
Edit: breaks $5900 ��
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:14:59
3476.49 (hopefully I lose)

Some serious FOMO to come buy at the mall today. ;)

Market sentiment has just dried up... no one wants to be the one to buy while it has dropped so far so fast. Unfortunately without serious buy walls in place to give it a solid floor for a few weeks or longer it will keep falling or languish until people forget about this massive drop and new optimism builds and fresh money enters the market. I did the come back in a year strategy and am down $75k at this point from my ATH and -70% on actual USD investment and have no Hope's to even make that back within a year.
