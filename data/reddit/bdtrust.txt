Would you like to spread the use and acceptance of Bitcoin?
Would you like to donate Bitcoins instead of fiat money to your favourite charities and projects?
Then Bitcoin Donation Trust is for you!
We know many of you have asked charities and non-profits, “I’d like to donate bitcoins, where can i send them?”. Be it WHO, wikipedia, UNICEF, the World Land Trust or many many others, the answer is the same. “Sorry, we don’t accept bitcoin, please send me your fiat money here!”. 
Well, its rather easy to say “No thanks!” to a handful of satoshis when you are a large organisation that collects millions every year. This is where the Bitcoin Donation Trust comes into the picture. We´d like  round up those handfuls to piles of bitcoins until saying no thanks is not an option anymore.
On bdrust.se you will be able to:
1. Donate anonymously to different organisations, whether they accept Bitcoins or not.
2. Donate publicly so that you can show off your donations.
3. Suggest donation targets.
4. Track your donations through our secure transaction system.
5. See how much money that has accumulated from all donations to every target.
6. Track how bitcoins is payed out to the targets.
7. Write emails to the organisations telling them how much money they will receive as soon as they start to officially accept bitcoins.
8. Follow links to the blockchain for all the transactions on the site.
We are developing the site right now and you can’t donate real bitcoins to charities or organisations right now.
However, the Bitcoin Donation Trust prototype site is now live. You can now donate mock-up (testnet3) bitcoins to mock-up charities at
