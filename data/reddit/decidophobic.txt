Looks awesome bro! (I know you're not a dude ��)
Will definitely be waiting for the Android app!
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:57:36

@_date: 2018-01-24 11:43:29
How so? I'm genuinely curious

@_date: 2018-08-04 00:42:37

@_date: 2018-08-04 00:45:42
That sub has been gone for a while now..
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:09:56
@_date: 2018-08-05 05:20:33
The heck are you two on about
@_date: 2018-08-06 11:19:19
Total blasphemy
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:07:02
Feels bad man, just came from there, didn't experience that tho
@_date: 2018-08-18 12:52:51
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:54:26
Because no
@_date: 2018-08-04 01:04:19

Theoretically if both were connected internally he could connect the 1070 to his monitor to game and only setup mining for the 760,? Although practically I know it wouldn't work..
@_date: 2018-08-16 02:06:54
And over in Australia, a bad ounce can go for $300...
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:10:11
You'd be spending more on electricity than you would gain from mining with a 760. I'd say keep the 1070 in everyday use, don't mine and keep your 760 as a back up in case the 1070 dies. Also, wrong sub. Try or something
@_date: 2018-05-14 12:27:09
This is great! How do I make it my phone/desktop wallpaper :-P
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:39:07

It's doodle jump for those who are *behind* the rest of us
@_date: 2019-03-27 08:19:55
Forgive me sir, I am but a pleb
@_date: 2019-03-02 11:40:42
I've heard mining on electrum is possible for phones, but you're in the wrong sub for that. And almost , if not entirely, impossible to mine Bitcoin on phones.
@_date: 2019-03-27 06:06:46
but Banks are Banks ����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:25:01
I thought the more one paid for a transaction, the faster the block would be mined, as one 10sat/byte is the same as ten 1sat/byte, then when the block is full it's then mined?
My knowledge of this is pretty bare so excuse any wrong assumptions I've made
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:17:16
Nah you should be good. Just watch yourself out there bc no one else is.
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:37:38
BTCMarkets (I think is less than 7, can't remember for myself but it was quick)
@_date: 2018-06-20 11:20:01
For ventilation, keeps the fire nice and hot
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:03:46
Depending on where you are: Kraken, BTCMarkets, a friend that might have some?
@_date: 2019-10-22 00:27:38
Maybe take the pin code off the image
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:02:34
I do?
@_date: 2019-10-22 05:17:20
Interesting, thanks!
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:30:26
Sure I'll give it a shot. What could go wrong?
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:48:22
Wtf does that even mean?
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:10:42
Might want to put a link in for him
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:44:07
Or @_date: 2018-02-07 10:09:45
If that was a tiny android app it'd be even better! +price notifications
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:45:34
I was doing this, until I ran out of fiat currency to trade ��
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:09:28

What's the imitation software "Cobinhood" on the Google Play store ?
@_date: 2018-07-07 10:31:27
You can only mine BCH, bc it's trash.
@_date: 2018-07-07 10:36:22
That would be Monero my dude ��
@_date: 2018-07-08 12:25:29
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:17:02
Will you be making it available in other countries?
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:11:56
Simple answer - yes. 
But looks like someone's trying to use your Apple iD. Maybe change your password/s.
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:48:08
Nah fair point, I was just unsure as to what their motives were 
I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised with their operation versus that of eBay
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:18:43
It's the coinsecure thief
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:34:40
Nah yeah interesting
@_date: 2018-04-08 08:30:02
Are there any fees like PayPal and eBay?
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:37:43
Wtf is this shit
