my email, which for some time all my family knew, was lordabortion (name of a black metal song)- I share your regret

keep up the awesome work then, and I hope Facebook doesn't block you. Make sure to make yourselves popular in Latin America, too, where *'sending your family money vía Facebook'* coold be a HUGE hook, particularly for people with emigrant family in the US and EU

read Peso. Thought it was aimed at some latin american market. Had hopes for it to be an exange that would allow me to trade Colombian Pesos (COP) for Bitcoin transparently, connecting to my colombian bank account
: (
anyway, good luck!

as long as regular folks have to even know what the hell 'private keys' are, Bitcoin is not going to go forward. This facebook app is doing an awesome work

is that really a quote from one of his novels?

costs about that in my countrie's currencym BUT to support your point, there's been talk about removing 3 zeroes from our currency for some decades now

hombre, cómo no crossposteaste esto en hoy lo pusieron y pude verlo. Voy a leer la entrevista. Por cierto, yo soy el autor de

amen to you: I store Dogecoin and Litecoin on my own wallets and to this day fear I'm not going to be able to quickly get my money out of my wallet because I'm 20+ hours away from installing the client and waiting for it to 'synchronize' with the network. Bitcoin, I've kept mine on a national exchange here in Colombia, because I want to be able to spend them IMMEDIATELY without having to wory about wallets, networks, etc.

thanks for this clarification. Next time I recommend you to write a similar text, read it a couple times, increase the font size on a nearby screen, but don't read it to the camera; just talk to the camera about the things written there and if necessary pause and look at the screen and say "oh yeah, also..." if you forgot something

I love this BUT I have a little suggestion for another version: when Bitcoin is more known, it should plainly say "tale my money", but the Gif should be the same. Implying that Bitcoin is in no way different to regular money, or actually even better because that's what Fry uses instead of common US dollars

**edit**: my post is written in frustration but has a hidden message: if you're NOT from the US, the UK or any other first world country, do you have ANY advice you could give me to actually be able to buy Bitcoins?
I'm waiting for not being Colombian, with a regular bank account in my country, not knowing how the fuck could I even buy Bitcoins in the first place, MUCH LESS at the completely theoretical price of $120, that varies within hours, which could mean I place a buying order and by the time they give me the conis, the value could be at $220 and I'd just had lost my time, effort and fee costs

 tries to connect local buyers and sellers in Colombia and Argentina. I used it this week to buy BTC before the price went to $150
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:04:33
why can't you get them back?. Honestly curious
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:06:45
im with you on this BUT the temptation to temporaly sell at a peak and rebuy at a valley is so strong. I only do it with 10% my BTC though. I always want to have some in store
@_date: 2013-04-27 00:13:43
yeah, I only bought those and I'm hoing my ASIC and selling services-products will give me more, instead of buying more on current price
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:10:40
maybe I will follow your example my friend. Those **were** long hours of anxiety last night
@_date: 2013-07-01 18:51:05
Hi. I'm from Colombia, South America, and I also had trouble trying to buy Bitcoins, until I found a site where I can buy them from other people, paying the money directly to their bank account.
I'm interested in knowing if that is an option for you, or how would you like to buy Bitcoin in China, since I maybe could develop a site to help chinese people buy and sell Bitcoin. So if you can share your experience with me I'd very much appreciate it!

3.5 here. Bought in Colombia using the first digital exchange in the country. Sent feedback to the developer to fix some problems, hoping the community will grow. Also thinking of keeping them until they're worth at least $1000 USD

I wrote them a very short phrase telling them I'm a resident of Colombia with no credit card. But I'd be able to donate to Wikipedia for the first time in my life if I could do it with Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:44:44
man, thanks for helping me think positively. When I started learning about Bitcoin 3 years ago I discarded the possibility of getting into it because I live in the 3rd world. I don't even have a credit card because I hate the overprice I have to pay for everything I get overseas + shipping. Then 1 month ago I decided I wanted in on this thing, even if I lost money. I'd be loosing it to something related to my area of expertise : )

well class definitions are initial uppercase and variables initial lowercase. I always understood camelcase to be a way to ease the identification of words but leave upper or lower initial to the context
