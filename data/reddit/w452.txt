No. Usually, the test for whether or not someone is negligent in providing an adequate standard of care as a fiduciary is called the "reasonable person" test. 
Again, that basically prevents the advisor from deviating too far from accepted practices in the profession. If you have a client with a 15m net worth and you lose him a couple of million on highly speculative investments because he told you he wanted to take risks to chase above market returns, that's fine. 
On the other hand, say you have a client making $65k a year who knows nothing about investing or finance, and his stated goal to you is to save for retirement/pay for his kids' college. The generally accepted approach in that scenario is a mix of broad market index funds and bonds in order to diversify away as much idiosyncratic risk as possible. If you put someone like that in a portfolio of 40% AMD and 40% Bitcoin and he ends up losing money, it's probably going to bite you in the ass because you just breached your fiduciary duty to look out for his goals and best interests.

Financial advisors aren't much better than the average person at predicting future stock prices or trends - the advisor job is more about knowing how to blend financial instruments together to create a very good potential level of return for the level of risk a client wants to take.

"I feel you, brother. I appreciate the positive sentiments. I feel stuck as well. I want to buy more coins, but after taking such a loss I feel a bit scarred. I am just bitter at the moment and feel like the price is too high for me to buy in. I will be very upset if it skyrockets to 5,000 and I'll also feel sad if it crashes. I'm not sure how to feel right now. I wish you luck as well. I have a good feeling about btc-e surprising us all."
