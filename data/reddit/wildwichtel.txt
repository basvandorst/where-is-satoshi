Why would they do this? They have no incentive to launch a double spending attack, since the payoff from doing so it small compared to the damage they would do to their investment in hashing power. It´s only rational that every pool operator continues to mine, even if they could destroy bitcoin (unless they are not motivated by money, i.e. governments).

Getting liquidated is totally fine and in some ways the expected outcome if you use leverage. Bitcoinica doesn´t care if you get liquidated as it´s only the result of you losing money to the market.

They don´t. They only give you the option to trade with 10x your capital on their site, which makes no difference to you (your losses and winnings are exaggerated, ie leverage) but a lot to them.
Think of it this way: You put in $ 10. With your 10 to 1 leverage you can now "buy" bitcoins worth $ 100. You don´t really own bitcoins worth $ 100, but only a long position at bitcoinica worth $ 100. If the value of the bitcoins raises to $ 110 and you sell, then congratulations, you just doubled your money even though the price only improved by 10 %. 
Contrary, if the price drops to $ 90, your position has lost $ 10 in value. Here´s where the beauty of margin trading comes in: Bitcoinica realizes that although your position is still worth $ 90, you are out of money, because the $ 10 drop has depleted your deposit. In order to protect themselves against losses they now close your position (forced liquidation). 
Of course, there is still some risk in this (positions can´t always be closed at a good price, especially when the market gets squeezed), but bitcoinica is still in a reasonably save position.

No it isn't. Crypto? What does this even mean? To the average user? A non technical person is likely to be intimidated by such a word and will not understand how he will benefit from this "crypto" stuff. This is different that, say, "social network" because everyone understands the words social and network and both words have a positive connotation. 
More importantly, the average user doesn't and shouldn't care how bitcoin works under the hood. All that matters are how it benefits him: it's like cash, only digital. So: digital cash. Possibly this should rather be digital currency, because bitcoins are not nominated in dollars. Digital cash kind of implies you dont have to exchange money, whereas digital currency makes this clear. Doesn't sound as catchy, though.

Yeah, but the upvote brigade we sent over there did just the same. [This]( comment was downvoted into oblivion, which could have been a good opportunity to educate people and disperse some of their (somewhat valid) fears...

I wish it would say more than "you know what to do", because this doesn't really help spreading the idea...

Since all the "work" being done is random guessing, you are never making progress. Every second you don´t find a block is "wasted". That means that someone else finding the block doesn´t set you back in any way, you simply start guessing for the next block...

Technically, "Mein Kampf" is not banned in Germany. The state of Bavaria owns the copyright for the book. They decided not to print it and to go after copyright infringers. 
This means that you can still buy the book second hand legally. More imporantly, the copyright for the book will run out in a few years (70 years after the death of the author? I'm not sure), then everybody will be able to print and sell the book.

I dont´t know why you´re so upset, because that pretty much sums up the point the article is making. Nowhere does he insinuate that a perfect user is not safe. But nobody´s perfect...
Therefore, key for developers is anticipating the stupidity of the users and protecting them against it. Bitcoin currently doesn´t do this, but rather expects a tech savy, security sensitive user. This might have worked in the beginning, but if bitcoin is to become big, this just doesn´t cut it anymore...

Plus, it´s not true: You can´t buy weed with bitcoin at görli park.
