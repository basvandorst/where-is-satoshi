Adoption (by devs and users) is what got BTC where it is now. Let's see in six months where choking off both will get you. Devs with a monoculture of Core, devs run amuck. Users with artificial constraints &amp; usability circle jerks like lightning

Can you name one person that's suffered losses? 
@_date: 2018-05-06 00:57:08
Nope, and you are describing 4x+ scenario. Propping up a coin with censorship, is the scam.  When the tide goes out, the scammed will realize who they are

No they aren't BCH has gone from .07 to.17 BTC in a month. IMO it's going to keep on going.  Because of this, that's not happening on BTC:

For every BTC I traded for BCH, now I can buy 3+ BTC - does that impress you? Not buying BTC now or in the future..

Youare easy to troll cause your positions are untenable. Besides, you sound like a 14 yr old mammoni. Renaming BTC mammoni coin

Thanks for the reply and correction. Transaction volume, applications,  adoption are trending up strongly - not a sign of a pump. I've been buying since August, screaming buy. 
Selling BTC for BCH resulting in greater returns in the past, and IMO in the future. Cheers

Think group think and the cultivation of that as moderated LOL totalitarianism, o sheeple

Appreciate the cordial reply, and agree, no one knows the future, it all comes down to opinions.  Yes BCH has a dust limit of 546 Satoshi's. So transactions well under one US cent are supported. Discussion under way on how to decrease the dust limit further.

I have actually, I'm talking about bitcoin on a bitcoin forum where  there's the one doublespeak truth, and dissension is censored. Enjoy your losses cause it's not over
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:59:50
You must be one of those people fake news is fabricated for, cause it's showing in your spewing of tailored facts
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:00:07
Appreciate the response. Here's a couple links focusing in adoption efforts, there's more on the BTC subreddit info page: resources -   Dev projects - 
  About working together, we tried that, remember segwit2x and the NYA. Blockstream, Core and supporers didn't budge, forcing Bitcoin Cash to fork off.  Regarding Very, he's one of the biggest Bitcoin holders and just looking out for his investment. Cheers!

You are right, I'm highly educated, constantly learning, researching and a heavy bag holder. Do the same amigo lest you end up blinded to holding a bag of stones

Totalitarianism is when people that disagree with you are labeled as bad people
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:01:28
No - that's dumb
