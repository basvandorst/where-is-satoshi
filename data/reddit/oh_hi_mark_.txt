"Backing" a currency is one method for manufacturing trust, wherin a government ties the value of its paper currency to some underlying asset that is knowably scarce.
The dollar is backed, in an abstract sense, by the fed's reputation for being a good custodian of the currency. This is a more precarious situation, but gives them more freedom to control the money supply.
Trust in bitcoin is manufactured by the way it works. Because it is itself knowably scarce, it doesn't require backing to prove that it's not being inflated. Because it is itself valuable, it doesn't need its price pegged to another asset.

I've heard this claim, and I'm not sure what it means. The blockchain is a means to manufacture trust in a system, in situations where trust is hard to come by.
I see a ton of companies shoehorning in blockchain tech to things that don't need it, and their share price skyrockets because of sentiment like this.
As I see it, the primary use cases for the blockchain are in tokens of exchange, contracts, and voting. What do you see as the other potentials of the tech? If currency is a use case in your eyes, how could a currency be better positioned to fill that niche than bitcoin is?

The biggest threat to bitcoin is a US-backed altcoin, IMHO. If the gov were to issue a fiat blockchain-based currency that provided most of the benefits of bitcoin, I suspect it would permanently retard the growth of bitcoin.

It would be centrally mined and used by anyone who isn't trying to avoid being surveiled or censored. It would almost certainly be faster and more widely accepted than any decentralized alternative.
It would relegate non-state crypto to a tool for avoiding state interference, since its other advantages can be copied

The best feature of bitcoin is subject to the values of its users. The fact that you are not impressed by the authority conferred by The Fed does not make it insignificant.
The US government, as such entities go, is very trustworthy, insofar as it is predictable. Most people, I suspect, prefer a centralized trust-based system to a trustless one so long as the entity running it isn't seen as unstable or unreliable.
Crypto will succeed and find its niche, but it won't take over the world unless fiat currencies around the world fail, which I have seen no portents of.

"consumerism" here is I think being used to refer to a culture that values the acquisition of goods for its own sake, rather than for the increased quality of life it has the ability to bring. This seems liable to create a race towards the exhaustion of our finite resources, which is suboptimal if you think that future people are worth doing favors for.

I think that we might be talking past one another. What would you say it is that makes something money?
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:41:47


US currency was once an IOU for precious metals. Fiat currency is a different kind of promise, but not a false one. The US government has every intention of keeping the promise of fiat money, which is to use violence and the threat of violence to ensure that it stays money. The only thing they promise to trade is that debts to them can be settled in dollars, which is another promise that they consistently keep.


Yes they do, and that is unfair, but if you have a better way to increase the velocity of money, or make it so that our economy can work with slower money, I'm happy to hear it. Command economies can solve this problem more easily, but that seems to me like a solution that's more unjust than the problem. The government steals a third of your income through taxes, and you're getting worked up about the 1.6% they steal through inflation?


Ever tried redeeming a bond or claiming a tax return? It's super easy to claim debt from the US government. If you mean the government will never try to pay back all of its debt, than my question to you is why should they? As you've noted, keeping a steady rate of inflation reduces the interest that they pay to almost nothing, and tax revenues can be expected to increase year over year as long as productivity keeps increasing. Furthermore, the US Gov's debt is one of its most powerful tools for diplomacy, trade, and peacekeeping.


Defaulting is unlikely, since the government likes having debt, and defaulting makes it more expensive to get more of it. By "Inflating their way out" I imagine you mean printing additional money specifically to pay off their debtors, which governments only do when they're trying to eliminate their debt, which the US Gov has no interest in doing.
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:27:39
"Money" refers to what a thing does. If a thing acts like money, it is money. Certain physical or social properties make different things better at being money than others, but at the end of the day, if you can pick any shop at random within a given geographical area and trade pocket lint for goods and services, then pocket lint is money.
USD is backed by the US government's word, yes, but that word is comprised of violence and the threat of violence. If you trust that this government will maintain a local monopoly on violence, that they will use it to ensure that their money is accepted as tokens of exchange, and that people will continue to fear the violence that can be visited upon them, then you should trust fiat money to stay money.
Even if every shop in the world decided to stop trading for dollars, the dollar would still have value and be used as money, since you can only pay your protection fees to the IRS in dollars.
It's not a lie, it's not a scam. It might be a racket, but it's definitely money.
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:09:24
So you clearly have a firmer grasp of the concepts behind this, but where are your money supply estimates coming from? Published M2 results seem to indicate that it has roughly doubled since 2006.^1 The estimates that I was able to find for M3 seem to be in line with that.^2
More importantly, price inflation is where value is stolen from you, and it should be evident that prices have not doubled since 2006. Expansion of the money supply is strongly linked to price inflation, but is not itself injurious to you or I. The measure of theft should be in the effect, not the cause. If you left money in an account since 2006, 20% of that value has been stolen from you in 2017, not 75%, because you can still buy 80% of most items that you could then.
Talking about housing prices, housing may or may not be overvalued right now, but the cost is below (in both 2017 dollars and 2006 dollars) where it was in 2006. It's not a great example, because everyone agrees at this point that housing was overvalued in 2006, but prices have not quadrupled.^3


Perhaps it couldn't at once, but the US has run at a surplus before. It could, in theory, eliminate its debt over time. It won't, but that's a matter of policy, not capability. Some of the money to pay the interest on its debt comes from more debt, and some comes from increased tax revenues due to economic growth, which does happen in real terms despite (and in many cases because of) inflation. The US does, in fact, like being in debt, however. If we had a 19 trillion dollar surplus this year, impossible though that is, we would not choose to be debt free, because that investment would have suboptimal returns.
It is good to have stores of value that shield one from theft by inflation. That isn't why bitcoin is appealing, though. There are plenty of better ways to reduce the degree to which you are robbed. The main appeal of bitcoin over a checking account is that it is fast, has low overhead, and is trustless between actors; not needing to trust the US government is nice, but the US government is much more predictable and therefore trustworthy than the myriad people we give the keys to our bank accounts on a daily basis.
In many countries with less predictable governments, the weight of advantages may come out differently, but the IRS and Fed are going to continue stealing from you in the ways that you expect. It's highly unlikely that they're going to steal from you in new or exciting ways.
