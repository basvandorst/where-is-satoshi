still an interesting read.

this is great news! jeff showing his qualities and commitment to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-28 22:52:50
i completely agree that bitcoin does not seem likely to be replaced by an altcoin (at least not one of the 700+ we have so far). but keep in mind that now part of the bitcoin value is likely to be from the Matcalfe´s law, or in simpler terms, all the participants in the bitcoin network. if most start interacting via another layer, this could change.
@_date: 2015-12-06 11:12:40
do you promise to do this every time?
@_date: 2015-12-06 12:33:54
i moved my miners from f2pool to antpool yesterday. i know what i am talking about.
@_date: 2015-12-25 16:54:48


i don´t reason like this at all. however i am puncturing their own argumentation.
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:14:46
good? this means the she will continue to push her blockchain perversion in "Digital Asset Holdings". where she dreams of using "the blockchain" (not bitcoin of course, and not the bitcoin blockchain) to push negative interest rates by making digital cash completely transparent to "the man". nothing good about this. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 12:26:24
the only company that fits your description is knc. antminer still sell their stuff and the others like BFL are gone for being fraudulent. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:44:33
they just try to leech of bitcoins momentum and disruptiveness.
@_date: 2015-12-23 10:10:12
so you don't have a shred of concern for centralization of clearing houses, however you are absolutely sure that bigger blocks will cause centralization?
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:15:01
so will shampoo, no one suggest banning it for that reason. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 13:01:04
now it probably is more down to _where_ you mine, or specifically what you pay for electricity.
@_date: 2015-12-21 09:29:30
let me put your tin foil hat on -
so gavin was compromised _after_ he gave up lead? and decided to bring mike with him?
for someone to compromise bitcoin dev, it makes a lot more sense to go after those in control of core.
edit: not that i think core is compromised.
@_date: 2015-12-19 22:13:30
not really, what private blockchain are they into?
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:32:44


why or? i believe both are need on the path to secure the type of transaction levels and rates we want bitcoin to be able to deal with.
otherwise i agree with your assessment.
@_date: 2015-12-06 12:12:02


bs, i mine at antminer and have mined at f2pool.
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:55:44
thankfully we have developers that will not be censored and ignored out of existence as well.
that being said, this is great work!
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:52:43
the movie usual suspects. well worth your time if you have not seen it. btw, i must be getting old.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:07:44
then we agree, here is the link btw (i assume you are familiar with it , but others may not):
@_date: 2015-06-15 10:49:52
They are still "only" "officially" around 5% like they have been for a while:
@_date: 2015-12-16 22:57:14
the only examples of censorship i have seen in is that a moderator that also moderates got a little "sensitive" and banned a member for asking him to "go away".
so while i mostly hold andreas in high regard, he is off mark here. go over to and see for yourself.
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:59:14
sarcasm, but this is effectively what she claimed herself. will see if i can find the clip.
@_date: 2015-12-20 04:49:04
they innovate. therefore they are not patent trolls.
@_date: 2015-12-25 20:51:09


i am going out on a limb here, but if they did, i think we would know.
@_date: 2015-12-06 11:26:38
they have the biggest pools, that is not to say that they have that hash power. if anyone don´t understand the difference, what happened to ghash when they got close to 50% and handled that poorly is a good example. they are now at around 2%.
the real miners will move if it is needed.
@_date: 2015-12-20 04:49:37
nothing wrong, except that it wont really work.
@_date: 2015-12-21 07:24:34


more like who is paying you.
if gavin was working to destroy bitcoin, would he ever have given up lead? clearly not.
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:22:25
nah, bitcoin will do just fine, just wait and see.
@_date: 2015-12-28 11:18:26
you can´t have a working blockchain without mining securing it. banks sharing a fancy spreadsheet don´t count.
i believe linux have seen some flamewars that would make this community seem like kinder garden. it will sort it self out.
@_date: 2015-12-28 10:35:23
excellent post and point.
as someone who had the sig "linux coming to a desktop near you" ca ´97 on slashdot, i agree.
i don´t think we can know where bitcoin will be in 15-20 years, except that it will be everywhere.
@_date: 2015-12-23 10:50:17


me too, however i would worry that if a large user base adopts ln before these problems materialise, we could be in trouble.

btcdark, but he has now been removed.
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:00:38


however i think that is more likely to happen from 2 layer abstractions making layer 1 less relevant or replaceable. in other words Metcalfe's law dictates that the value of the network will be in layer 2 and not layer 1.
@_date: 2015-12-25 20:49:49

@_date: 2015-12-25 11:31:53
all of this without a single shred of evidence that bitcoin / virtual currencies has been used by terrorists.
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:11:49
this is from jameson loop so he knows what he is talking about.
however i think bitfury is not chinese, f2pool, antpool and bw is.


F2Pool (22%), BTCC (11%), Slush (4%), and Eligius (1%) are mostly remote miners. These are the true public pools.
so with f2pool and bw some percentage is from outside china.
lets agree that more should be free world regardless. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 12:07:03
true, i mine at antminer and have mined at f2pool.
@_date: 2015-12-28 15:07:52


even if the largest pools are chinese this does not mean that the hashrate behind them is. i mine in a chinese pool btw so i have some idea about this.


i would argue that the banks are already compromised. take how HSBC has been laundering money as an example. i would also assume that these private keys could be compromised with pussy and high heels, try that with the bitcoin blockchain.


again i am not sure you understand the difference between a miner and a pool. however companies like 21 and knc are likely to push this in the right direction.




i am sure they will make it secure enough.
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:27:45
agree, no need to wait for ln.
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:15:57


read op post again, this is not what he claims. it has succeeded in ways that was not easy to see 15/20 years back.
edit: spelling
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:17:31
really? i have not seen censorship there.
@_date: 2015-12-06 13:46:41
ghash to f2pool: dude these guys are so worried about our 51% hashrate, ok if we put half our miners on your pool and the other on antpool?
true story!
@_date: 2015-12-28 13:37:36


sure, it will just not be anywhere as decentralized and secure as bitcoin.
 &gt; "fancy spreadsheet" is just ridiculous and delusional.
it completely lacks the beauty of the bitcoin concept imho.
however i am sure mike will make it as good as it can get, and R3 are lucky that he was driven to them by the nasty handling of xt. frankly he is the only thing i fear about them.
@_date: 2015-12-12 16:45:50
indeed. i am sure we will see a lot more closed loops of bitcoin use, however there is no reason not to welcome every bitcoin integration until we get there.
@_date: 2015-12-06 12:09:45


ghash is not that long ago, so i doubt that.
@_date: 2015-12-21 22:17:08
it seems likely that this will be part of the plan for banks like JPMorgan and initiatives like "Digital Asset Holdings" run by Blythe Masters. some background: 
R3 i don´t know about, but i don´t assume they will play nice.
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:10:43


theymos censorship and core feet dragging does not help.


assume good fate mush?
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:17:40
I have seen it, just strange that their "official" hashrate is still 5%. Note sure that is their true rate.
@_date: 2014-12-21 10:24:40
It is better if you are a teapot:
418 I'm a teapot (RFC 2324)
This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fools' jokes, in RFC 2324, Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers.
@_date: 2014-12-20 09:43:27
Great idea and demo, but I would like to see some source code and documentation. If this is to become part of http, this needs to be put into an RFC (I belive): 
EDIT: there &gt; this
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:38:40
If that happens it could indirectly boost bitcion / crypto as other companies would / should do anything to prevent fb from monopolizing "emoney" like they have done with social network.
Bitcoin / crypto would be the best alternative for these companies.
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:02:08
that is probably the best description of cryptos advantages i have ever read. and what i believe will be the case.

@_date: 2015-12-19 23:22:52

i have no hardon for patents, but they are a part of tech. better these guys patent bitcoin related tech, than patent trolls.
@_date: 2014-12-21 11:52:32
Exactly, set a maximum amount, if that is exceeded then a confirm is needed. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:58:26
Maybe not. Any company that is not FB will now have a massive incentive to not to let FB do to money what they have done to social networks (or prepare to pay some arbitrary FB tax).
The alternative is obviously bitcoin / crypto.
@_date: 2014-12-21 18:54:54
The btc link and amount displayed need to be unambiguous, this is probably why we need to enter RFC land. Even if a chrome extension could probably take care so that the amount displayed to the user is the amount to be payed.
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:33:01
Also have a look at libbitcoin:
I find both the documentation and code very clear. It seems the API doc is lost for at bit but I am sure it will find its way back.
@_date: 2014-07-07 13:47:29

@_date: 2016-03-04 06:52:19
nah it is stupid, hash rate is at insane levels already and growing quickly, so there is clearly a lot of money to be made, and fees are no big part of it yet.
when bitcoin has taken of properly, the amount of transactions (blocklimit will be gone) and deflationary aspects of bitcoin will make it profitable.
@_date: 2016-03-04 06:56:43
it is not declaring bitcoin dead, just that we have a situation where one core dev team deliberately cripple bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:45:16

shitty use of a brilliant quote to castrate bitcoin into a "settlement" system.
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:48:04

@_date: 2016-01-28 10:21:49


you probably don´t like people? your point is that core and only core should have some say in what bitcoin evolves to?

@_date: 2016-03-05 18:56:50
tell me your logic is not along the lines of: we just need to increase the fees until no "spam" can make in into the blockchain?
cause if it is, how many legitimate use case do you kill in the process?
@_date: 2016-03-04 18:53:45
not like i really think core devs tell them what to censor, but it is clear that theymos &amp; co censor in a way that helps to core.
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:10:31
of course you don´t. cause you so smart.
but i can play that game to. if he is such a crap coder why don´t you give me some examples in his code? one or two is fine.
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:43:08


how many hints does core need?
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:50:19


so the attempted extortion has worked. nuts, this shows more than ever that core needs a serious shake up.
e: assuming that the article is correct about f2pool pulling their support
@_date: 2016-01-27 19:45:18

just not sure i believe it.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:12:36
and now bitfury to:
@_date: 2016-01-28 06:08:59
oh you mean he did not get "consensus".
well lets see about classic shall we, still a little early to count that out. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:47:27
cryptsy used irc, this had a back door. coins gone. this has nothing to do with how secure bitcoin is.


e: my bad, the backdoor was not in their irc code / service but in the Lucky7Coin code. but this was based on an irc backdoor
@_date: 2016-01-28 06:20:08
cheesus, i don´t think anyone on the bigblock side would suggest that block size is the only way to scale bitcoin, in time there will obviously be more. and yeah ln would be great. _however_ blocksize is simple and works right now.

oh, you mean anyone that don't agree with you.
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:49:45
RBF never had consensus, except from our core dev overlords. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 15:18:58


this is where one company in control of dev is a great idea?
@_date: 2016-03-19 11:24:08

i have more than enough tech clue to know that this is not fud. the paid fud goes the other way.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:31:40
don't think he ever implemented spv. mike did.
@_date: 2016-01-23 23:39:58
moderation is not censorship
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:17:16


and that would mean less people using bitcoin, meaning that bitcoin clearly will be less useful and probably less valuable. in other words that could leave bitcoin only useful as store of value.
@_date: 2016-01-28 21:39:06


this is not correct:
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:02:40
yeah and you are a mind midget. what in his arguments do you _feel_ is wrong?
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:39:34
the entire article is essentially a "argument from authority" claiming that the big block side does not have the necessary technical / scientific understanding to support it demand for bigger blocks.
of course ignoring the devs that are pro (like gavin and jeff).
@_date: 2016-03-14 06:41:08


you can't really say that without having every core nodes ip before and after. sure there are a lot of new classic nodes being fielded because a lot of people want to show support, but you don't know how many where running core before. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:53:51
there was nothing in the white paper that mike did not cover.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:17:32
he made the first spv bitcoin lib that is still used by most wallets. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 10:52:26


this is exactly what brian talks about. you know 95% will never happen for any fork.
@_date: 2016-03-15 12:09:29

you can evaluate a persons commitment to an idea, that is far for worthless.
if you think gavins actions compared to autsin hills defrauding are irrelevant for bitcoin, you are a moron.
@_date: 2016-03-02 12:57:37


and you know this because?
even if you belive they are, the answer is bigger block size.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:23:45


If you disagree with me, fine. But that doesn't change the fact that this sort of software is considered off-topic on Take it elsewhere.

even if you believed a significant amount of core devs have autism (i doubt that), in defence of people with autism, bill gates has been believed to be autistic. did you see "the big short"? the guy with the drumsticks? autistic (in the movie and real life).
so that leaves what really is the problem for core, but having read up on austin hill it seems to be clearer for me.
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:40:56
these "attacks" are just possible because blocks are almost full.
@_date: 2016-01-02 08:24:47
yeah? where do i find this.
3tps is no where near 15M per day. pretty sure satoshi had better maths than that.
@_date: 2016-03-06 18:38:58
now find me any other significant pice of software that does not have bugs when it is released. this is not what i would consider "gigantic mistakes" even if it is a nasty nasty bug.
i find that people who does not understand this aspect of software development has not written significant amount of code.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:10:20
knc supporting bitcoin classic is great! now let´s see if we can get other miners to join.
@_date: 2016-01-29 06:08:27
thanks for the links gmax, interesting reading.
i am not sure i agree that this shows gavin seen bitcoin as running "exclusively out of large datacenters" on the other hand.
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:16:53
very few people can claim to predict what satoshi may think. gavin is one of them. you are not.
@_date: 2016-01-03 11:10:57
well desktop is about the only place they may not use it. with android phones, smart tvs, routers and most of the net, people probably use linux every day without knowing it.

good catch, but then i have always been a troll, just not in the sense you would like to think.

who knows, the last once that have tried to bring up block size has been largely ignored.
@_date: 2016-01-18 23:12:57
any links to the devs where they claim this? stunned if they are not willing to take the feedback from the community more constructively.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:59:56


saying this about devs like gavin and jeff is just stupid.

like when the block are filling up, and there is no scaling proposal accepted by core that will be available in time.


with 72%+ of miners in support this is not a real argument. nodes are not that clear, but nodes left on the shorter chain will be wasting their time.
@_date: 2016-01-02 17:21:42
ok, my bad.
@_date: 2016-01-08 15:02:25
so anyone who disagree with "core" is essentially a troll?
seems something a troll would say.
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:56:52
so a religious nut job, manipulating and extorting miners is somehow good for bitcoin?
this will backfire, one way or the other. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 12:44:58
i always expected bigblockers to be the majority, seems confirmed.

good question, now ask yourself about what austin hill and bs has to loose by a minor block size increase.
@_date: 2016-03-20 15:47:27
core, theymos, blockstream has noting to do with any ideology, ancap or other. 
it is pure elitism, played like a fiddle by unethical market powers. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:56:38
well what about the time he was the lead maintainer?
frankly the biggest mistake he made was to give that up. but lets see, he just may come back.
@_date: 2016-01-23 22:53:08
throwing psychological therms around you would think that someone would have at least a reasonable understanding. i see nothing to suggest dissonance here.
a better example would be someone who believes in bitcoin for its censorship resistance, while at the same time supporting censorship in r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-28 10:18:08


admitting mistakes is an important quality.


that is an opinion, not facts.


he has clearly gotten a lot of bitcoin right as well, that should help.
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:13:30


in what sense? they are better at making fudge? gavin is probably bitcoins best visionary.
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:54:37
price is picking it self up again, so sure.
@_date: 2016-01-19 04:15:37
this is the only comment i have seen that suggests this.
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:50:32
he did declare it an altcoin, lets see now.
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:22:46


well he is being sarcastic and a little immature, so maybe.


if not him personally (he seems to have a mind of his own) then a lot of the core devs with bs may well be.
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:57:51


not an argument, core is just men as well, and they are wrong now.
e: at least when i comes to block size. just look at their argumentation, at first they don´t want to increase block size because chinese miners "would suffer", when the chinese miners are ok with this it is still a problem. cause then it would still cause "centralisation" even if that is just speculation.
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:36:34
clearly this is related to mike losing fate in bitcoin because of censorship and power abuse in this sub, core pretending block size is a none issue and more.
so good we now have new bitcoin subs taking over.
@_date: 2016-01-11 18:10:50
you would think that something like bitpays proposal would get at least some attention.
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:57:56


Yeah? what is ignorant about it?
@_date: 2016-03-06 12:46:47


some examples maybe?
@_date: 2016-03-07 15:28:45


at the very least, the community disagree with central aspekts of the HK agreement, that are again central to keeping core as the defacto bitcoin implementation.
@_date: 2016-01-23 10:32:23
and threatening miners with pow change because they don´t agree with you, is somehow less Disrespectful, dramatic and stupid?
@_date: 2016-01-17 06:03:20


and your judgement and authority comes from what technical achievements? 
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:55:09
pieter also was clear that he would not support this. however the signal was already sent, and some miner may have gotten cold feet.
@_date: 2016-03-17 19:07:46
no they just run out of memory
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:07:41
well they are quoted as saying that they where scared. so the quote maybe wrong, but if so there is no reason to trust the rest of the article.
@_date: 2016-01-12 06:19:03


not it is sick. their willingness to resort to censorship and extortion is unbelievable. no matter where you stand on the blocksize / ln / whatever, their actions alone has proven that they are not fit for having the control they have.
that being said, they are being routed around as we speak.
@_date: 2016-01-17 06:58:40
my bad, you are right. only about 72% of miners support bitcoin classic. and like you point out, if we torture 72% enough it will probably become 90%.
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:51:41
let me strap myself in. in your universe, what made 90% of the network decide on a new dev team, and code base, within hours of mike quitting? lunar phases?

no it is idiotic. these morons seem to have decided that "core devs" effectively are our dictators.
censorship is a systemic failure, just give it time and the community will route around these idiots.

why target one company in particular? and a company that is pro xt at that. hardly a by chance.

you are the expert.
@_date: 2016-01-11 21:42:44
it is hardly the 10$ he took. the damage is creating a tool and demonstrating to any number of other villains how to use this to steal from coinbase specifically. so the damage he cause may be substantially higher. he also demonstrated in another post that he knew a "large exchange" had lost tens of thousands of dollars to similar actions, so he knew what he was doing.
@_date: 2016-01-17 06:45:04
really? what part and what is his name? need to see his code if he is that arrogant.

@_date: 2015-08-20 12:16:56
Well if you let an altcoin handle it then it is not bitcoin, but yes that could work.
The real problem here is that you lose the network effect of having btc handle as many use cases as possible.

My experience with Linux is what makes me believe bitcoin will be big. I got into it in the 90s and remember discussing it with a sales man (in IT) at the time, he asked me if I thought we would "ever see Linux in the server rooms".
These days you would have a hard time finding any server room, or home for that matter, that does not run some form of Linux.
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:45:57
and you do understand that a $1-2 fee kills an whole lot of potential bitcoin use cases?
@_date: 2016-02-04 15:18:27
the fundamental problem is that one company is in control of a majority of core devs. aka developer centralisation. assume god fate, assume bad fate, assume fucking muppets. this is the problem!
had more companies been represented this may have been less of a problem. now (if we stay on the core path) we are at the mercy of the marketoids in bs.

well some of the signers also support bitcoin classic, i suppose this is a last desperate effort by core to stay relevant. 
at least they are now engaging the community and not just blockstream.

that is just stupid. if they were not safe enough for the use cases where they are used, they would not be used. you don´t need to enforce this by code changes. i would love to see one of the core devs or peter todd claim this. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:56:09


no shit sherlock. also take note of the missing H there, IMHO.


i was thinking about a great post here on reddit by a miner (large), i will see if i can find it (if it has not been censored that is). when it comes to the hashes, a lot of miners are sitting on the fence, and you know it.

because only the core team should have a say in what bitcoin is and not? you prove my point by saying that.
if anything will cause a hard fork, that type of attitude is the cause.

@_date: 2015-11-07 16:37:06
the basic idea is that most transactions are done on a layer above the bitcoin network as it is today. only a few of these transactions will ever need to be added to the blockchain.
some benefits are:
- instant payments
- less load on the blockchain
- possibly more privacy
it a very interesting design i think, but it is a complex design. and in my opinion not a replacement for bigger blocks.
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:46:58
forgot to comment on hard fork. it will need changes to the code to work, it will however not break older clients (from what i understand), and is therefore a softfork.

@_date: 2015-11-16 12:17:40
cash also throws a spanner in the "negative interest rate" works. cash could be used to move money out of "oppressive economies" or even store value.

no the fees are killing their business, like it has killed a bunch of other use cases (yours as one example).
but who cares as long as core and blockstream are happy right?
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:20:02
that is not the point, the point is that there are uses of zero conf out there already and it works for them. so there is no need stop this by changes to the code. the argument is stupid because it is already proven wrong by everyday use (you know, by Bob).
@_date: 2015-11-18 17:31:17


and make things like bitcoin illegal.
@_date: 2015-11-19 15:42:29
hardly, probably Hearn being frustrated with how XT has been censored out of existence, and since other devs has had a problem with how he wanted to "get into bitcoin" he had little to lose.

pathetic when this is seen as "the killer feature" of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:18:34
well if i knew what the killer feature is, that is what i would be working on.
it is possible that your assumption holds like you describe it (i doubt it), but we want bitcoin closed loops.
@_date: 2015-11-02 11:27:25
the usual "blockchain" is great, bitcoin a curiosity bs. get used to it, in the end it will not matter.
@_date: 2015-10-10 21:26:22
i started wondering if this is what the "darkwallet" devs are working on now.
anyhow, this is a very interesting use case for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-24 09:20:10
i read gavin move like: "keep your friends close and your enemies closer".
engage them and work with them where it does not compromise bitcoin. on the side, work hard with the features that makes it irrelevant if they try to compromise bitcoin.
edit: btw, i still agree with andreases vision 
@_date: 2015-10-14 03:11:03
theymos claims he is one himself.
how he wraps that around censorship, i have yet to understand. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 17:02:05
sure it can happen, to core as well however. if you do have a clear and well put to spec with several implementations, that is still probably safer than one code base. like how airplanes have redundant control systems built to the same spec, by independent teams.
@_date: 2015-10-28 12:01:06


if Gavin brings something up i think it is a fair assumption that it _is_ a worthwhile discussion to be had (you _should_ to).
@_date: 2015-10-14 17:20:50
you do know that there is a lie in every rationalisation?
@_date: 2015-10-01 04:34:24
the acronym "SPV" is actually not in the white paper even if chapter 8 describes "Simplified Payment Verification".
mike is probably referring to popularizing the therm as he wrote the first implementation of SPV/Simplified Payment Verification. that by the way is used by a lot if not most of the wallets.
edit: sentence building gone to hell
@_date: 2015-10-31 05:42:04
hard to match the redundancy of bitcoin.

Notice the _when_ in that sentence (if?). 
Anyhow, believe it or not i really want ln and stash, and big blocks.
also talking about strawmen, wtf is this:


@_date: 2015-10-24 19:29:21


notice how this relates to a somewhat evolved ape, not fish and snakes.
@_date: 2015-10-18 09:47:34
this would mean even less full nodes than today and not help centralization. but yeah, this is how it worked in the early days (when you could mine on you pc)
@_date: 2015-10-21 12:42:35
that would be interesting, a "meat search" could at least prove if they exist as more than a web page.
@_date: 2015-10-18 09:41:44
yes that suggestion would not help the current problem of centralization.
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:35:37
the point of the "fidelity problem" that if the transaction fee is too high, it can kill a lot of potential use cases for bitcoin.
one of these use cases could be the killer feature that lands us on the moon.
@_date: 2015-10-01 04:23:25
seems unlikely that one of (if not the first) guy to write an SPV implementation would try to steal the therm from the white paper.
this is more likely some troll posing as mike, sentence building gone to hell or a very interesting freudian slip.
@_date: 2015-10-31 05:52:00
i am sure they had, but that for some reason it failed to kick in.
however it is a great example of the advantages bitcoin has, this could not happen to bitcoin.

exactly, the acronym "SPV" is actually not in the white paper even if chapter 8 describes "Simplified Payment Verification"
also great point on mikes contributions, bitcoinj, lighthouse and more.
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:48:42
i have no idea if amir &amp; co are smallblockers (todd obviously is but he does not appear to have contributed).
but i see no problem with someone taking core and creating a fork, this is why it is opensource after all (or at least one reason). 
@_date: 2015-10-24 19:16:19


yeah, who gets to decide?
i believe we are far better off having people like Gavin and Andreas (ex. he did speak to the Canadian senate), engaging and creating dialog with "the man". thereby giving us a voice, rather than having banks running their lobbying machinery to ensure that we get properly shitty regulation.
@_date: 2015-10-19 15:11:21
so no discussion of block size?
more "moderation" of a new dev list not under the control of jeff?
no gavin, no mike, no jeff.
bitcoin _core_ dev meeting alright.
@_date: 2015-10-18 10:38:55
first of all this was not my suggestion, so i can't claim to understand it perfectly.
however your understanding seems like quite at stretch of what i precise to be the original idea. from what i understand there is not direct relation between incentive and the bits / coins you lock down.
even more importantly your way of looking at this would also be a problem with the lightening network.
lastly even if this was the case i am not sure it is a problem.
@_date: 2015-10-29 17:37:31
yeah, life on the edge.
@_date: 2015-10-14 04:36:45
sure anarchism and censorship are best friends.
wtf is "unaligned incentives" in this context anyhow?


that´s not the problem. that one of the factions censor others is.
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:20:35


try googling strawman
@_date: 2015-10-18 10:13:22
but the "faker" would be somewhat limited by how many bits / coins he would commit.
@_date: 2015-10-06 03:31:47
its value will not be determined by transaction fee, but by how many use cases it solves.
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:53:59
an ancap that relies on censorship to push his veiws. the cognitive dissonance should melt his brain.
@_date: 2015-10-18 10:11:47
good point, but what if you don't add that information to the blockchain? it is just used by the miner to split some of the reward.
i realize that the information leak would still be there when the transaction propagates through the network. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 04:44:38
and how can any new concept ever achieve "overwhelming consensus" if it can not be discussed?
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:32:08
i see your point and i am also sceptical that this is a good use case for bitcoin. so if we are talking about the Fidelity company i think we agree. my point was that there may be other and way better solutions that are killed by high fees and this is what i consider the "fidelity effect".
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:14:05
thanks for the info. however it is clear to me that what he says about xt to a large extent also applies to ln (not that i worry about that). i have some reservations about mikes alleged support for blacklisting. i also believe that you can have big blocks without more centralization (but i need to do some more "homework" before i can build the case)
@_date: 2015-10-24 19:25:09


no doubt about that (HSBC comes to mind) and it is this we have to make sure to communicate to everyone. quite possible using things like the "bitcoin alliance".
@_date: 2015-10-02 20:59:35
i have some serious reservations about blockstream but this is great work regardless, so please show some appreciation for it. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 10:54:27
be very careful with investing in pre-order mining equipment. i would love this not to be a scam, but be aware of all the bad players that have done similar things.
@_date: 2015-10-05 18:27:51
i believe Gavin and Mike cares less about making visa 2.0, than to actually have bitcoin live up to what the white paper has in its title:
"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". because if you end up with 20$ transaction fee (or worse), bitcoin clearly does not live up to that anymore. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 21:29:44
there is also a chance that satoshi was abducted by aliens. but do you have any credible reason to think so?
@_date: 2015-10-19 18:06:05
again, thanks for taking the time to answer and create the summary!
lets see how this progresses.
@_date: 2015-11-18 17:54:51
probably Blythe Masters, she is pushing a "private" blockchain tech that she believes would enable negative intrestrates by getting rid of cash. her problem is that something like bitcoin would have to be regulated out of existence for that to work.
@_date: 2015-10-02 20:49:08
lets follow this type of logic a few steps more:
- some banks create their own coin and gain popular support from users and market
- other banks are left with the choice of supporting the coin of another bank or try to create their own competing one
- or just start using and supporting bitcoin to avoid "citicoin" and Citibank domination (or similar)
if bitcoin is the internet of money (i think it is), then this is like all the attempts to create "private" internet(s) we saw in the early days of the internet.
edit: formating
@_date: 2015-02-07 13:04:57
If you store enough bitcoins to worry about security, you really should take the cost of buying a trezor(or similar). It´s in my first hand experience a great product.
EDIT: there are trezor competitors that may well be comparable (ledger?)   
@_date: 2015-10-18 09:58:21
good point and i know the example you are referring to.
from the top of my head, what about having the first node that see a transaction have it id/ip added and then receive some (small) part of the miner reward when the transaction is added to the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-10-18 11:22:39
yes as i understand. but no direct lockdown 1000 bits and get 100 bits every year.
more like lockdown 1000 bits to prove you run a full node, for some incentive to do this.
@_date: 2015-10-18 14:20:08

this woman is just trying to push the private blockchain crap her new business (digital asset holdings) tires to sell.
lets educate the planet on the fundamental differences between "private" blockchains and the bitcoin blockchain. we will find negative interest rates (or banks and governments stealing your money) useful in that regard.

i still hope we can agree on these tips on how to build a strong community:
@_date: 2015-10-14 05:15:02
i don't claim that promotion == discussion.
it seems however, that you guys are very quick to claim that discussion == promotion and censor on that basis.
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:18:32
so if we have a discussion about, well.. say bip101, and most here think that it brings important changes. then we have consensus?
@_date: 2015-10-05 17:03:37


@_date: 2015-10-12 16:48:05
thanks for clearing that up, pure speculation on my part :)
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:03:21
and you base this on what? lack of neck beard?
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:04:24
i would argue that just the suggestion that there are "poisonous people" can have nasty side effects in a relatively healthy community.
they do however identify a type people that can hinder the progress of a project. specifically the OCD type of perfectionist and process obsessed types. that i think can be very relevant to the current situation in bitcoin development.   
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:50:28
thanks for the post and info!
still would like to know why people like gavin, jeff and mike have not been in the last meetings.
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:30:30
he is not just referring to xt and core but mentions other implementations like libbitcoin (my favorite as camel case tries to stab me in the eye)
@_date: 2015-10-23 12:48:53
or too paranoid
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:13:01


no and it needs to be gone (or lifted) before this idea takes hold.
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:04:22
and therefore one codebase? and you claim this even as we have 3-5 implementations that already works?
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:48:16


or he fears for the future of his work, and steps in to save it.
@_date: 2015-10-18 10:06:41
this is clever.
i suppose you still could doctor the software to proxy both sides so that what is really a single node looks like collection of nodes with a corresponding collection of addresses. however you still have to commit some bits in a collection of addresses, limiting the number of nodes an attacker / cheater could fake.
@_date: 2015-10-18 09:03:21


How would this work? It is not listed in the use cases.
@_date: 2015-10-18 09:18:04
i think the problem now is that in the early days every node was also a miner and the incentive was coins from mining and fee. when mining and running and full node became to separate things there was no mechanism in the original bitcoin protocol to handle this.
i am sure there are many solutions to this problem, if it is given priority.
@_date: 2015-10-28 11:48:48


yeah, and probably one of two humans with the most experience with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-18 11:35:12
for any problem there is a solution, that is not the same thing as saying it is easy.

i think mike effectively is a proxy for a lot of us that feel the blocksize debate has not been taken seriously enough (or even sabotaged).


i agree, if a leader does not realize this, he/she will not look for improvements in his/hers leadership.
@_date: 2015-10-18 11:39:46
but this could be done using other mechanisms that the ln. it seems like a lot of people think ln is the magic answer to every bitcoin protocol deficiency. i would rather like to see the protocol improved.
