I just had this conversation with my brother, I prefer Bitcoin and he loves gold and this was his response yesterday.






Gold Reserves (supposedly) held at the Fed: 261,000 (Gold ounces)






I think he's trying to tie our printed money to Gold but were not on the Gold standard.  No way Gold goes to 65k an ounce.   I believe he's saying because it jumped up in 1980 and wasn't tied to the Gold standard it will happen again, I'm not sold.

Ya, a coworker of mine doesn't want to get any because he thinks you have to spend like $900  for a whole bitcoin.  I told him you can buy smaller amounts but he doesn't get it and I have heard that before, different terminology would help.

Hey hey.....ya you're right.  I'm still holding in-case something miraculous happens but I'm not holding my breath.  Was pretty fun while the hype lasted, bitcoin is way more steady I just hope it doesn't go away from the hype being over.  Saying that I don't think it will.

I'm a noob to this, where can I see the shorts and learn about that?

The volatility is getting way better but to put someones paycheck when they REALLY need all of it into Bitcoin right now is a little too much.  Although that 10% fee is pretty high, so who knows.  I think it's an amazing work around though, but still a little of a gamble for people that need to feed the family. But what do I know, hope I'm wrong because it could be an amazing solution.

Treasure chest with a paper wallet in it near old man Bill's Oak Tree, make it shoot out confetti when opened with a recording of your best Morgan Freeman voice.

As much as I love Bitcoin I just don't think we're there yet.   Would love to be proven wrong, but ya like others have said I don't see people putting their savings into it "yet".
@_date: 2016-05-29 02:47:44
What happened?
@_date: 2015-10-10 04:46:41
Congrats man, well done.  Mad at myself, remember a thread about bitcoin on blackhatworld around 2011 but thought it was world of warcraft money for some stupid reason.   Just thought it was game currency, pissed i didnt read about it.
