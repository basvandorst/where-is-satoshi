Yeah, I'm 1200% up for the year. But oh no this crash is the end of me! /s

I'm pretty young, so my 401k is only 2.5 years old and I only started investing heavily into btc/eth last year and my crypto just broke past my 401k at around $20k.
Edit: Even a conservative estimate, I'd put a 30 year 401k at like 400 or 500k.

Or check out Moto x. Motorola was recently bought out by Google, and the Moto x is their first collab phone. Very similar to a Nexus but with some cool features.

Damn... well Lenovo  a good company too... I was hoping for some more phones like Moto X. I guess we'll see.

I'm just having trouble loading or exporting my wallet to another client so I can use it. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:13:45
My wallet is a .wallet file. How do I open it with another client?

Yeah, BCC is already taken.

Oops, I meant to say desktop. My mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:51:30
Why's that?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:45:57
Start buying!!

I believe this is how Bitcoin/crypto will see universal/mainstream adoption. Through countries where bitcoin is more reliable. Imagine if  most of Central and South America started using Bitcoin as their main currency.

That's my favorite anime!

I mean.. It's still better than storing it on Coinbase right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:08:59
It won't let me create a GDAX account :(. Something about public records or address is wrong.

I prefer Exodus because of the multi-coin support. Is there any better ones, or is Exodus ok?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:57:17
Exodus is a pretty nice ~~hardware~~ Dekstop wallet.

You forgot Hamtaro
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:42:17
Oh ok thanks.
