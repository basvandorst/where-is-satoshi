well, as long as someone puts up another coin every 24 hours, it will technically continue....

you have a few K, sinking all of it into a risk situation like bitcoin is nuts.  buy $200 worth of bitcoins.  Start a brokerage account, grab some non-volatile, dividend paying stocks, that are down at the moment (WMT is a thought).  If you are playing with your cash cushion (not a brilliant idea), you need most of it in a form that can be accessed in a few days.  So that, if crisis happens, dump the stocks, pat yourself on the back for the dividend, and it was like cash in a bank.  if BTC goes berzerk, making huge gains on ANY investment is ALWAYS at the very tail of the curve.  On average, the average investor, will do average.  I understand not wanting to want to have a single penny in the bank, fuckers give ya .1%.  
Any data point in the history of your portfolio looked at it from 10 years in the future will look meaningless, even if that $3000 went to $6000.  
However, the complete nightmare that will befall your life if your $3000 goes to $0.  Something happens, wife gets pregnant, your wife needs a kidney, whatever, crisis happens.  then for the next 10 years you are looking at a catastrophic series of fail.  Don't risk money in this game you can't afford to lose.   
It's easier to sleep being conservative.  we spend like 30% of our day sleeping...

no.  There is nothing out there that could be trusted, and too many variables to even try to figure out a future exchange rate.  Every bitcoin held is a bet, a speculation, as to the future.  The future looks good, we'll see.

I don't know about europe, but.... a reasonable view would be that a small amount of this is OK, and is unlikely to run afoul of the IRS.  over 10k.... well, good luck.  
probably it's not that clear cut or as simple as that, if one could live in the US, as a resident, and not need a bank account with over $3k in it, then yes, you could probably, and fairly safely slowly move money in to the US, over the course of YEARS....   as a mechanism to move 100k or 1000k or more... I wouldn't do that.  just pay the taxes and bring the money in.... OR, just go to Dubai and buy an Enzo.

to the point of 'all-in anything', why put all eggs in a commodity/currency play?  Equity exposure?  bonds?  if you're in it for the long term, then there can't be a 50/50, and what's 'long term' 10 yr, 20?  50? 2?

open bitfloor account, deposit at wells fargo.

From my standpoint, mining is profitable right now, and this is good time to mine.  
As a store of value BTC is poor compared to equities (no dividend payment, significant risk etc).  Equities are wealth builders, not holding currency or gold etc.  One does need currency to purchase equities, especially in times of crissis.  
Holding deposits in banks based both within and outside your own country protects a person living in greece for example, and gives them good opportunity to buy equities if the shit does hit the fan.  The Germans will protect the Euro.  End of story.  
So, the only demand increase due to increased risk would be people wanting to hide their wealth, unfortunately, bitcoin is just too small to do that.  
I think the increase in demand for bitcoin is from gambling.  People love the gamble, and the increase in value has coincided with the increase in the size of the blockchain.  This isn't a bad thing, the more people USE BTC the better.  And if playing bingo or hi-lo is what people want, then let's just be happy they are using it at all.  
I think the gambling is the cause, and in terms of the future, I have one simple question...   When a group of investors tear down a casino they don't replace it with homes.  It is replaced with a BIGGER casino.

Sometime in november, early december.  
Bitcoin is pretty volatile.  If you are hesitant, then I would suggest that this 'investment' is likely not appropriate.  
My justification for this statement is thus: if you are getting on Reddit, and posting as above, then money in all of it's liquid and not so liquid forms likely means too much to you to just 'blow'.  There is Risk here, in all of it's horrible forms.  The market is unforgiving, and it never sleeps, there is never a down time.  Going 'long' in bitcoin right now means looking at a horizon after Pirate (which, as of this weekend, is apparently about 2 weeks).  Look, all I'm saying is this bitcoin thing is really hard to handle a lot of the time. 
At the end of the day, you get in bed, and you have to defend your actions, to yourself, or your wife, or your kids... 
I have bitcoins, I'm in it, I like it, but I sure as shit don't put money into bitcoins that means something to me.

There is some risk to the block reward halving and the tsunami of ASIC.  One scenario is that the use of mining by video card will end, that is, people at home will have to purchase their BTC with real dollars, not just in 'free' money from mining.  Hopefully some of these easier funding methods (such as depositing at wells fargo) or bitinstant, or Dwolla gets better, will offset the end of mining(for some people).  The risk is, what if it doesn't offset, and BTC fades into obscurity over the next year.  
If your analysis indicates this scenario won't happen, then the increase in accessibility to the currency will ENHANCE it's value, increase volume, and increase demand.  All of which will be good news if you buy BTC now.

However, said mining equipment has value outside of Bitcoin, that is, nice video cards capable of driving 3 monitors, with good quality HD playback is a capability I needed.  My company will need video cards for our CAD Stations as we hire back workers we laid off 4 years ago.  The now 6 or 7  year video cards we were using are junk now (and still sitting at their workstations (no workers), but 5800 and 5900 series cards work well for our purposes, so, until I can hire people back, I mine with 'em.  It's more for fun than anything else.
@_date: 2012-08-04 17:12:32
it's also more profitable, because the purchase of the card is off the table, the only loss is the depreciation, and when cards go for only $80--100 on craigslist, most of the depreciation has already happened.

No, it's RISK management, by working out a deal where the chip fab takes all the risk, BFL gave up timetable management.  
In my line of work I often operate under such terms.  Clients that don't pay until the project is making profit, don't get the same level of service as those that operate on a monthly billing cycle.  is life.

a damn good point.

Nope, didn't break TOS at all.  They had a server outage, and generously gave me a free week.  I thought this was cool.  I paid for the next month... and then the account suspened for non-payment.  I started a few support tickets, 1 per day.  And after 3 days they canceled the entire account.  There is not a facility to email customer support.

Buying a Jalepeno, now, is not an investment.  (don't downvote quite yet).
1.  BFL hasn't shipped.  And the thing can't even BEGIN to 'pay for itself' before it is in your hands.  If you buy one, you are loaning BFL some dollars until it is in your hands.
2.  The thing has no utility besides mining coins.  This is different than video card mining becuase a video card still has some utility, and therefore, some value once you are done mining.  And it has value WHILE you are mining since you could pause your miner, play CoD and start mining after playing a game, watching a movie, etc.  Sure the video card is dropping in value all the time, but it still gave you the utility of playing CoD, or warcraft, or whatever.  An ASIC is useless for anything but mining (or possibly cryptoanalysis, which is probably not interesting if you are asking this question on reddit).  
3.  Let's say I buy $1000 worth of ASIC, and my brother buys $1000 worth of INTC, after a year, he has earned a dividend from INTC (say 4%) and he sells it for roughly what he paid.  This is a pretty conservative play, and not very much risk.   An ASIC is always a race against the clock, as more and more ASIC come online, the difficulty will increase, and your 'investment' becomes worthless.  In fact, it's such high risk, and scary and crazy, that it would be more effective to compare it to say... IVR or TWO which pay 18-20% dividend, per year.  Now that 20% dividend sounds fantastic, but those stocks become worthless if interest rates rise. 
The following reasons are why you SHOULD buy a Jalepeno
1.  Bitcoins appear to be trending up in value, which helps you not lose money outright.
2.  More and more merchants appear to be accepting bitcoins, and diversification of your source of coins is always good.
3.  Mining bitcoins is fun (and the idea of 'printing' money  appeals to the broader laymen, and increases interest, which helps us all)
4.  Online gambling, illicit purchases, all sorts of reasons to get your bitcoins in a way that is not 'through dwolla, mtgox, etc'.  
My point is, there are FANTASTIC reasons to buy an ASIC, but treating it like an investment is not one of them.  Identify how you will gain utility from your purchase, and weigh that against buying BTC outright.
