That is not true whatsoever. How you be taxed on capital gain, when you have none?! You are only taxed if you have a... wait for it... a gain, when converting BTC to anything else, such as food, USD, other crypto, etc. If you have a loss, you can claim it at up to $3k per year as a capital loss.

ALL gains on BTC or cryptos in general are taxed at capital gain rates in the US, unless offset by losses. ALL gains, regardless of profession.

That is not true! You are taxed on the PROFIT, not the total. So if they made $0 that year, they owe no taxes, even if they were trading millions. If they made $10,000 on $1, they only pay taxes on the $10,000, the profit. It is not possible for them to "lose money" after paying taxes. Unless they really screwed up their taxes. Look up Schedule D rules.

There is something wrong with this picture. If you owe 400k, that must mean you had a profit. And, since the MAX you could be taxed at is 39.6%, that means you made at least 1 million dollars at some point. If the tax owed did not come from profit, you still had to have had a lot of money in crypto to lose 400k.
It appears that either your previous profit, or your salary can support, at least a very large chunk, of the 400k bill.

It says, quote "When a net capital loss exceeds the $3,000 limit, it can be carried forward to future years." Losses can be carried forward.
