Truth to be told... noone knows, my man.
Make up your mind on if you WANT to invest more.
If so... maybe invest some of it now and some of it next monday.

Don't sell. You'll soon be OK!

Buy 1/3 today, 1/3 next monday and 1/3 the following monday.
That´s more than often a tight model.

Just correcting you, mate. Did not mean to hurt your feelings.
Great analysis btw. Excellent work.

Surely there must be another way than just sending out money :)

I can believe how scared people sound.
Bunch of children, who hoped to make a quick and easy dollar.
These are the ways of a real marked, kids.
If you don´t like it, then best wander off and save us from all your whining and moaning.
Man up for christ sake!

First of all: I am not poor. I have more money than your entire family combined. So I am not the poor fellow here, mate.
Second of all: Noone knows when this downfall turns. I am just interested in knowing, if this guy knows more than any of us.
As far as I know, it could turn any second now.

Those ladies might have made you rich... who knows.
Practice the exercise of looking away (totally) for one week.
