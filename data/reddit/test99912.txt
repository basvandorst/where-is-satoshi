@_date: 2017-05-18 19:58:35


Only because a HF means they keep covert asic boost benefits. Remove that and they support Segwit to increase BTC price, thus profits. Really too simple. Miners have a job to secure the network. We don't have to worry about their emotional state. That's not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:30:41
They will say you're wrong and then point to their 2mb+sw poison pill. Don't fall for it.

@_date: 2017-05-19 16:34:54
Yes, and strangling bitcoin for profits based on exploits is...not disrupting anything at all.../s. We don't want uasf ideally....but we are forced into it and it's now our best and safest option forward. Please stop the FUD.

Nope. Not happening. It's UASF or miners signal Segwit. That's it and that's all. Price rise is likely reflecting increased support for UASF.

This is not how you win a debate. Also only one of those comments is slightly off base, admittedly. You're going to need something of substance and not just personal attacks toward other people.
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:18:49
You can see the trolling ramping up. The conflation of Barrys proposal to their own 2mb poison pill is telling. These bitcoin companies and ceos are scared shitless of Segwit as 2nd layer developments and applications will be the end for many of them.  
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:00:37
Fork off. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:39:47
We can. There is enough support forming for UASF. Corrupt miners going to get the finger, and Bitcoin will get Segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:09:18
Triggered troll.
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:58:51
There's no reason to rush 2mb out within 12 months. What if more infromation is found that there are safer routes to take by then? We are still going to go the inferior route? We need to just get Segwit activated and then think about block size from there. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:34:58


That's you...smearing the best and safest scaling solutions for some time now.
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:35:01
No. You're completely mistaken on every level. Even the article on bitcoin.com points this out lol.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:05:01
And even then...what if we find out in 12 months that a 2mb HF will actually hurt bitcoin or we find better scaling solutions by then? No need to shoot ourselves in the foot. Bitcoin needs to be able to adapt. You should just directly support UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:26:04
More excited about UASF than price right now that's for sure.

There is no compromise. Miners are abusing an exploit and that's the only reason for their shitty compromises that don't make sense. Segwit MASF or UASF is the only way forward. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:35:46
Well said sir.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:18:39
Provide a source. He never said that. All I ever saw him do was clarify Barrys stance for people.

Is that all you have? This is a mostly anonymous forum. Why not respond to the message directly instead of attacking the messenger? Also, as stated, it's in your interests to act this way chinese miner compensaton or not, so thanks for choosing by far the most obviously speculative part of my post to attack.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:47:47
Just because MASF is superior doesn't mean UASF isn't the answer.  There's literally no other option better. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:23:40
Segwit is 2mb.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:50:53
Same shit happens if you just bump blocksize you fool. We need 2nd layer or fees will be high forever. That's why Segwit. Stop your ignorance people.

@_date: 2017-05-18 20:03:52
Because doing it as hardfork instead of softfork lets it get by. Now you see why they push for the HF so hard for so long?
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:04:33
UASF is upon us.
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:10:15
Well they dont want it anyway because segwit as a soft fork stops their precious asic boost. Nothing to do with following through with things in the future.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:36:42
Nope. The BS "Sw+2mb" poison pill proposal will NEVER happen.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:43:44


@_date: 2017-05-18 18:59:04
These idiots need to stop conflating "SW+2mb HF" with Barrys suggestion of Segwit FIRST then 2mb in 12 months. 100% different. Please expose the bullshit, and if anyone has Twitter you can let Barry know that his ideas are being misconstrued for personal agendas of big blockers supporting jihan. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:40:41
Lol it won't. That's the funniest part. We need Segwit and 2nd layers.

Troll FUD. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:02:57
My mistake, but my post and my stance stays the same because this keeps happening. The way you write it "sw+2mb HF" is exactly how jihan and rogers club write their poison pill. This doesn't help anyone. You have a ton of people on the BU side saying Barry is on their side. It's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:27:06
There would be no 2 sides if Chinese miners did not have an exploit. Segwit would be their top priority to increase profits otherwise. People need to stop skipping over this fact. Once we stop the exploit, we can get Segwit without a dangerous poison pill attached. UASF is already gaining huge ground so I suggest you look into that and support it if you want Segwit the fastest and safest way. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:25:31
TL;DR enjoy your uasf altcoin
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:40:41
It's the safest and quickest. And yes, miners crippling bitcoin are indeed forcing this. It is their choice. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:09:08
So much this! UASF!
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:24:53

@_date: 2017-05-18 19:06:55


Attack the message, not the messenger. The tactics you just used to discredit me are the typical paid shill tactics you accuse me of, therefore I have no other reason to believe you are just as I accused a shill conflating Barrys message.

0 time to be exact. Miners will double down on spam to keep their mining profits up. 2nd layer scaling is the only true way to make tx cheap for users again. Oh shit why am I responding to a blatant troll?
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:15:17
No. It's time for BIP148 UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:57:19
You've fallen for it. You are confusing 2 different things. What Barry is suggesting is different than what evoorhees is pushing. He wants an immediate hardfork just as BU supports. They are trying to confuse the 2 on purpose.
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:13:46
Or I've simply paid attention to your posts...
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:30:05
You won't support Segwit as is either MASF or UASF. You push for 2mb poison pill that benefits chinese miners asic boost and adds unneeded dangers and uncertainty. You've likely been compensated for that, but you also have your own incentive. All you want to to divide sides and keep the debate going. This benefits your shitcoin business. Time and time again you have shit on Core and this sub. You try and play nice guy to both sides but really you just sit and enjoy your shitcoin profits while laughing and continuing to peddle more discord. You are terrible for bitcoin and would learn to keep your mouth shut if you actually wanted  to see real progress.

@_date: 2017-05-19 16:45:11
It IS the safest, and it DOES have support and has several months left still for others to join. You are simply FUDDING. More trolls triggered by UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:23:20
It wouldn't. Miners would up their tx spam base level which would continue pushing fees up for fast confirms. We need Segwit and Lightning Network to ever have near free fees again.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:02:28
Because he said users shouldn't run nodes...which is exactly what the OP is saying....and also he has been part of the ongoing attack to to strangle bitcoin and keep the fees sky high to pump his shitcoin business.

Only moronic trolls like you support sw+2mb poison pill hardfork. Bye  non bitcoin using troll.
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:56:04
Except there is no compromise. They will only agree to a unnecessary hard fork which lets them keep covert asic boost. Either they signal and activate Segwit or we will UASF and get it activated ourselves.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:32:58
No, sorry, but you're definitely a troll and also wrong about UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:51:33
So much this. **
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:24:06
No. Barrys suggestion is completely different than the "Segwit+2mb" suggestions by the others. They are advocating for a hardfork which adds 2mb blocks at the same time as segwit. They are now trying to conflate these ideas and confuse people into the "2mb+segwit" bullshit which is to protect covert asic boost. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:50:56
Most important part. The fact it's also the fastest is just the sprinkles and gravy.

@_date: 2017-05-18 22:50:43
Well I think the "just pick one" attitude is an extremely wreckless way to handle 30 billion dollars either way. Segwit/UASF is the quickest and safest way to more scaling and a better bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:00:57
I've already proved you wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:24:39
Feel sorry for anyone who buys this propaganda. Too obvious he's being paid to delay segwit and promote hardforks. Bitpay probably needed a bailout after jihan strangled scaling. So kind of funny, but also sad, he teamed up with the same guy who was trying to put him out of business.

Haha the irony of you idiots. Bye troll. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:07:45
Segwit would be accepted by Chinese miners if they didn't have covert asic boost benefits that would be halted. For that reason we are being forced to UASF and implement Segwit that way. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:18:56
Price has absolutely nothing to do with talks of block size increase...unless you mean that is whats holding the price back. If anything it's the UASF momentum thats picking up.   
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:12:06
