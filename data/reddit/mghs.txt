$75 a month with no data plan.
That's a pretty steep price, buddy...

Yeah.. in your opinion.  As in, the opinion of the person running the company.  Personally, however, it doesn't seem like a worthwhile investment, and it also seems like a waste to have to get a new phone every month.  What happens to all the old ones?

If I could pay for Bitcoins through Paypal, I'd have jumped in by now.  But as it is, I still don't have a clear idea on how to add coins.  Mt. Gox seems like a minefield (in fact, all of Bitcoin seems like a minefield) in terms of trading, but it sounds really fun to do.
Before anyone says, I know why they don't allow Paypal users to buy Bitcoins, but I still think it's disappointing.

Okay, can someone please tell me what the best way to buy Bitcoins is?  I have not heard of a good, easy way of purchasing them yet, aside from mining, which my computer is not built for.  If Bitinstant doesn't work, which is what I was planning on using, then what are people using to buy these things?

Excellent, this really helps.  Thank you so much.

But wait, I thought you could already add money to MtGox through their own site, can't you?  Why would you use Bitinstant for that instead?

I see.  I'll probably just send the BTC to my own wallet then.  Thanks for the info, this helped a lot.
