Well you asked for it. Pretending to be hard core like price swings don’t affect you because you’ve made big man losses. Then you throw out a number that quite frankly is pitiful to the gains and losses I’ve endured. I don’t pretend to be hardcore. I’m probably just a dumb believer in a better world.

What backs a floating dollar? The belief others will accept it because they trust it is sound money and useful as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin is more useful because you don’t need an intermediary to use it and it doesn’t get debased. It is secure and cheap* and fast* and doesn’t require third party oversight. Ultimately it is backed by trust and utility.

@_date: 2017-12-08 20:53:44
So let me get this straight, the “big boys” have bought. And you are advocating not buying. Thanks for clarifying that you are not a big boy.
If they ideologically believe, and they don’t sell, nothing is lost. For example, if I buy a house because I want a house, and I can afford a house. Then the very next day Mr Market decides houses a worthless, I still have a house so long as I don’t sell it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:49:22
If you cash out and it moons, you will also feel like you lost the most money ever in your life. Problem is, Bitcoin is money.

While that guy is amazing, the issue here is not a lack of opportunity, or overcoming odds. It is regret over a lost opportunity. Opportunity will almost certainly breed regret, because we can't always be right when we make these choices. The best you can do is make choices that feel right at the time, and when we look back be happy with the hand we played (right or wrong). If we are constantly trying to improve our circumstances, we will constantly create more opportunity, and ultimately, this will create more regret. As I have moved forward in life (particularly financially) I have noticed the financial mistakes of missed opportunity get bigger and bigger. This is partly because I am create more and more opportunity, and the multipliers get bigger. Bitcoin skyrocketing (exactly as predicted) doesn't help lessen regret, so I'm always simultaneously happy and sad that it is going to the moon. Dealing with regret is hard. It is a first world problem (in the financial sense) but we all have regrets we need to deal with. Some are more acute than others unfortunately, due to time, and clarity of the alternate outcomes. I have also had depression induced from regret, and bitcoin induced regret (fortunately not bitcoin induced depression). I don't have many solutions, but it is important to recognise there are many other opportunities (potentially more risky unfortunately - but hey, look at Monero :). The opportunity has gone, and you have to let it go - it is most likely you wanted the money for the time it would afford you. Living that time with anguish is only adding to the loss, so meditate and grieve it, but let it go. Talk about it with others if you can, even write stuff out - hell this comment is pretty therapeutic. Visualising the other alternative futures can help too - what if Bitcoin tanked when Segwit 2x with bugs was released? You would have felt like a champion - and it did have bugs. Black Swans happen, none of this is guaranteed. Live life in the moment, and practice gratitude for what you have.

@_date: 2018-05-02 17:09:16
The problem with Bitcoin maximalism is that they are mostly right, but maximalism means that they have to be completely right on the claim - all other digital assets are worthless, hold bitcoin at all costs.
This implies that all other digital assets have no value and cannot correctly attain a valuation at a higher % gain than Bitcoin.
This is clearly ridiculous. Especially since something small of value will grow faster % and the odds that no other digital asset holds any value is as likely as Bitcoin having 0 value. Ironically, as a currency, it is this kind of spending that actually increases Bitcoin’s value as trade creates wealth.
The only real defense of maximalism is that it is so early in the game that outpacing hodling is likely to be difficult and that by holding you are providing a great service to bring about the required change for the ultimate goal of Bitcoin. True economic liberation. That said, by increasing and leveling distribution you are also helping. So I think the maximalism is mostly correct, but not 100%, which makes the term kind of incorrect.

The FUD unfortunately scared me into buying some fiat and missing some of this run, so I'm not having the best day either courtesy of the bickering from both sides - I don't know who is right or wrong, good or bad - I'm just trying to tease out the truth. Buying fiat hurt a lot since I've always been a believer.

My point still stands, just in this case 20s means many years left, and thousands implies a high marginal utility. If you said 60s and millions diversification probably makes sense.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:38:53
Same boat here. The conclusion I have come to is that the regret selling hurts too much, more than the loss in a crash or the joy of the ride if this is to become a global currency. The upside potential is enormous and minting this with a 4 exahash computer is expensive. As is blowing up a star for gold. It has been reliably been doing the same thing in a volatile way for 7 years, we should learn to live with it. Treat it like the shared global piggy bank and put little bits in whenever you can regardless of price. I have large opportunity cost from selling. Don't be me :).

@_date: 2017-08-16 04:37:53
It looks like that at first appearance, and you investing certainly does favour a subclass of stakeholders. However, this doesn't mean that is their agenda. Satoshi actually made a very fair distribution based on anybody that wanted to believe could join in and get some. They were very cheap for a very looong time. It is all perception, the agenda is to liberate people and money, you just have to choose to come along for the ride and not worry about where you are on the train, so long as it moves everybody forward.

It is funny that when I tried to have a reasoned discussion about scaling here people replying to me were being censored. I know this because I would receive a push notification. But there would be no trace of the comment when I opened my phone.
The original early adopters of Bitcoin were and probably still are very skeptical about the modern banking system, so in that way the r/BTC community isn't very different, many are probably pioneers that hold both, but disagree about the implementation of scaling and how it relates to the original white paper. Calling them "conspiracy theorists" is a weak attempt to marginalise people that have a different belief than you.

I completely agree, I'm just saying that given all of this, it isn't completely surprising that r/BTC are how they are (questioning, skeptical and vigilant) - albeit some maybe of the other less savory sort as well. One heuristic that would be helpful is signing statement from keys that are very early on the blockchain.

Your last comment was truncated for some reason, but that does sound like a conspiracy theory. I don't say that to marginalise the theory you have going about Mike and Craig Wright. I think CW is a scam artist so you might be onto something. But cypher punk concentration seems like somewhat of a silly designation. People are people, they hold beliefs, they are fallible and corruptible. I prefer to follow the money, and look at action and motive. I have seen censorship here, I've seen AXA investment, I've seen Craig Wright BS and Mike Hearn seemed pretty reasonable but had a rage quit for some reason. I've predicted and seen Gox insolvency, I've seen major banks institutions engage in outright theft, I've seen PayPal economic censorship, I've seen things that I'm legally prevented from discussing. All I'm saying is, trust nobody unless you have to - cypher punk or not. My rant meandered there I think... oh well.

Why so secretive though, couldn't they have announced this prior to the fork?

Not saying that was unwise, in fact it is probably a more profitable strategy, but I haven't been bothered to dust of the Trezor. You never know if mining profitability changed a flippening could occur. Unlikely, but even the Ethereum run was unlikely. This Bitcoin rally seem very predictable though.
I went through your comment history, and I actually agree with a lot of what you say. Which is unfortunate since I'm an unintelligent troll.

That's what I assumed. This still does not send any energy back to earth via a block. It just moves the energy utilization into space. The only thing transmitted could be the mining reward. That could be then used to buy energy, which would need to be generated on Earth. Really you are just moving energy utilization to space rather than sending energy to earth. I don't swear on Reddit ever, so this is a first - that is a really fucking stupid comment.

You lost me at create new "gold mines with cut and paste". This is clearly untrue, due to the network we see, and the ineffectiveness of the forks even. You cannot create more Bitcoin than the 21 million cap.  More crypto currency, sure, but money doesn't work like that. You have to endure the tests and time to make it valued, which means giving people the faith that they should share the delusion. Once you reach a critical mass, you can't stop the delusion from probabilistically working well enough to work. And by then you have a self fulfilling prophecy.

There are a bunch of different central banks.

I think the answer to this is that wages cannot use Bitcoin as the unit of account, unless the business is running entirely on Bitcoin whereby they can correctly assess their cashflows in a deflationary environment. It may be that in some cases wages would need to be adjusted downwards, but the real purchasing power would be greater than at the beginning of the contract. So long as Bitcoin has some measure of purchasing power (maybe as a standard exchange price against gold) then you should be ok.

This is not true. If everybody in the world buys Bitcoin at higher prices you can eventually get everybody out of debt. Imagine you have 21 people, 20 have $10 debt and 1 has $2000. There will only be 21 BTC on the island but currently there are 4. The rich guy buys both of them and has all the miners :(. He sells 2 for $5. That guy sells one for for $10 (to 10 people for $1 (their salary). A new coin gets mined. Market cap is now $50. These guys are great holders and the rich guy is bored and realizes this really is the future. He wants them all back. He’s going to pay $200/BTC. The other 9 laggards see the price skyrocket and they want some too. 
Unfortunately , they only have their wages to buy with so they all pour in and get roughly 1/200th of a Bitcoin. The rest go back to the rich guy, as much as the other 10 clear their debt and hold the rest. They end up debt free with 0.1 BTC left. The rich guy mines another and is now fabulously wealthy. He really wants to pump the price up now, or alternatively the other 9 see their friends clear their debt. Maybe the rich guy wants to dump on the price to scare the shit out of the holders and buy cheap (use your imagination). Let’s say the other 9 bid up the price and with their next salary of $1 each they each buy at $20,000 giving them 1/20000 of a BTC. Fortunately, this makes another one of them debt free, and all the others debt free on paper. Only 8 left, and another meteoric rise and they are debt free (or if money bags adds liquidity to the market they are free).
Plus, many have some bitcoin left over. Welcome to equity based money.

This is a bizarre statement. You have more trust in people you can't see for a large transaction that people you can see. OK, makes sense. A DEX would give you the ability to transact without a third party taking custody of your assets. You have no requirement to trust. Anyway, I can see that you have never been robbed by a bank or censored by a middleman and have little regard for your own sovereignty. One day when it becomes an issue for you, you will realise that it is a valuable freedom to have and given the option to have it or not, it is wiser to have it when there is no requirement to not have it.

I don't need to prove the viability, that is what I'm asking about. If you want me to prove it is obvious, I think that most people that see a capacity problem due to the blocksize limiting the transaction throughout, the obvious step is to increase this size, thereby increasing capacity despite increasing overall resource costs on the network - despite being in the future from when initial implemented and technology costs coming down.

Didn't say you were lying, just disingenuous.
And nothing of the change in nature to the protocol....

Good counterpoint
@_date: 2018-12-14 06:55:38
It truly is. Problem is, you can regret upside and downside. The trick is to find contentment with what you have. I'm still learning this trick.

So many people are what makes it the top.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:24:10
Maybe $0 or negative even.

Because Satoshi planned for it to fail from the beginning... cool story bro.

Other rich people gave me horrible advice.
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:29:25
Had nothing to do with time adjustment, or strategy. It was just horrible advice. Wealth is a horrible heuristic to judge people worthy of taking advice. A better metric is how they made it, and how much skin they have in the game you are seeking advice.

How does it make any difference?
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:28:52
Selling. If you were burning them this would be good for fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:37:05
I've been on the ride a long time, and lived to regret every sell. You still feel the rollercoaster though.
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:04:10
Yeah, so I have too. Been here since 2011, it still hurts - you do mentally checkin at the top, wonder how people could be so silly to sell so low, but at the same time enjoy the chance to be able to buy more. It’s bitter sweet and does make me consider a timing strategy a little more....

It will happen after accumulation. Now if you dummies would just capitulate already, we can get the ETF up and running.

I'm really not sure what to make of the current state of affairs - I feel like a subject in an Adam Curtis documentary.

It shows % return.
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:27:43
It should read "was"
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:10:17
You are far wiser than I. No I haven't :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:58:15
Ahh, got it. The 2011 holders are still up quite a lot.
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:50:01
Please explain?
