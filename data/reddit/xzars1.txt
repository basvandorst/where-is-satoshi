AFAIK, they are no longer operating in Hong Kong and they are not domiciled there either. Word is that they moved their back office operations to Taipei in Taiwan, but the company is domiciled in a offshore tax haven.
It's a complicated case. But I recommend you start by contacting BitGo. They can at least tell you based on the contract details what is the legal entity of their customer Bitfinex, and where they REALLY are domiciled and operating. That will at least point you to the correct jurisdiction.

To put the statement in other words: nobody argues that we can get away without ever increasing the block size. The fact that people argue/do not argue against HF or the block size increase is not the key point. It's a debate of what we do first - widen the gap, or better organize how the existing gap is used. Both are important in the long run.

A bitcoin invoice is not any different to a conventional B2B invoice. Only the billing details vary.
Below you will find the information I present on my XBT invoices. This follows good accounting practices. How you design the layout is completely up to you.
For a hassle-free solution, I recommend to search for a conventional B2B invoice template online (i.e. Excel spreadsheet). Modify the fields to meet your needs, and export the final invoice as PDF to request a payment from your client.
    Bill to: 
    - Client's business name
    - Address
    Beneficiary: 
    - My business name
    - Address
    - VAT Reg No.
    Item or Service:
    - Description and quantity
    Payment information:
    - Your bitcoin receive address
    - Sum to pay in XBT 
    - Optional but highly recommended: current FIAT-to-XBT conversion ratio
    - Reference description
    Other:
    - Date of raising the invoice
    - Payment due date
    - Contact details (E-mail, Phone)

I visited a closed Bitcoin discussion group in Brussels in April. A few of the mid-ranking EU officials were there and surprisingly, there's no outright hostility towards Bitcoin. What appears to be the case is that they "may" want to impose a small 3-4% Bitcoin tax in the future to level out the playing field with conventional payment systems. Note that it's probably not going to happen before 2020 and there's no reason to panic, at least for now.

We will just need budget hardware wallets, and those wallets must be easy to use. It should be noted that Internet Bank's security is already matched by a 2-factor-auth Bitcoin wallet.

Considering a hard fork of the Bitcoin as you proposed, the damage will be done long before the consensus for a fork activation is reached. Also note that such a change will cut out legitimate ASIC miners, greatly reducing the network hash rate and security. By this time, XBT = ETC = PoopCoin, but yes, the Bitcoin will still prevail.

I hodl quite a lot of XBT myself. My choice is Trezor HW vallet, but Ledger would work too. Pick one or the other.
Personally, I do not keep a true copy of recovery seed anywhere in a physical form, not even in a secure vault.
My own preference is to write recovery seed down on a regular paper, but it only contains ~90% truth. 1 to 3 words are replaced with false words. Just I and one other person know how to construct a true seed from the obfuscated seed. This may not be necessary, but I have no worries at airports when my luggage with a "recovery seed" in it is inspected.

Any gamblers, SegWit optimists around? If anyone still believes SegWit-as-SF will activate before the deadline, send me a PM, will gladly place 2 XBT bet against your 1 XBT stake on a trusted platform of your choice.
The most likely middle-ground to reach adoption is SegWit combined with another L1 capacity increase (preferably dynamic). Even if we set place a rule that from 2018, the block size cap will start increasing by as little as 0.5M annually, that should suffice.

Not surprised. Fiverr is specialized in $5 freelance gigs. Bitcoin transactions are getting too expensive for that business segment.
Not yet a disaster, but after Bitcoin is no longer competitive in $25 market (possibly by mid 2018), we will see mass drops of individual businesses accepting Bitcoin. That means lunches at mid-range restaurants are gone, digital products from music albums to e-books only available via PayPal and CC payments.
Hopefully we'll have a solution in place before that happens. Even if it means a temporary 70% price drop and 2 chains, it's still better than letting bitcoin die slowly.

Your points about the benefits regarding charge-backs are valid. But lack of interest can directly be correlated to payment fees in such price-sensitive market segment.

Interesting insights. If you want to get more support from the opposing, or the un-decided side of miners - why not undersign a guarantee letter which states that your team will indeed work to release a L1 capacity increase?
Problem is that the opponents don't trust you. Belief is that once you have LN and SegWit, you just force everything to take place on side-chains, raising the L1 settlement fees so high it's virtually useless.
I posted a question (recommendation) here which didn't gain much popularity in this sub. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:52:27
Well aware, also support SegWit.
With SegWit + LN in place, we still need to scale on-chain/L1 from 7tx/s to a 3-digit number, minimum. SegWit alone doesn't scale L1 by that margin.

Bitcoin doesn't need an ETF. It's not that hard to buy REAL coins today.
Only notable gain comes for U.S residents who could, in some cases, defer their tax payments if exposed to BTC via ETF (IOU) instead of real coins. In most of Europe, having a ETF share would not give any tax advantages over real coins.
There's no misinformation about it. ETF is by all counts bad for Bitcoin. Except for short-term gamblers, fortune-seekers, and U.S tax residents.

"Yes" is actually not as good as it may seem. Yes, a potential short term price gain, but once ETF trading is established, all the "old finance world" problems such as extensive price manipulation, over-leverage, derivatives are carried over to Bitcoin. I also want Bitcoin to be able to hard fork at any time, without any notice to a ETF bureaucrat. This may become harder if considerable investments are involved via ETF. In worst-case scenario, this can establish a point of control for a government to influence Bitcoin's future.

There's 25% of casino-style gamble, a portion of XBT portfolio which I've bought in exchange for fiat. The rest has been acquired via business activity.
Why not sell XBT to opt for safer options? There's a stupid and greedy part in me, but at the same time, Bitcoin is much cooler. It has the upwards potential no other asset has. In regards to prec.metals, they too have some flaws - secure storage and transportation is expensive. Furthermore you have to account for risk of confiscation and tax mans' robbing arm - just moving your own gold to another country with no intention of selling it to a 3rd party is in many jurisdictions taxable at the border.

What is missing from SegWit proposal:
1. L1 Increase which allows miners to collect more fees. SegWit is an increase which does not allow to collect more fees. (Lack of incentive to upg.)
2. Core has to prove the will and ability to further increase L1 capacity in the future to allow continuous growth. SegWit is a good start. (Lack of trust)
These 2 items.

Give those guys benefit of the doubt. They are still committed to open source. They want to wait until most have upgraded before details of a fixed bug are revealed. I'm not completely sure who discovered the previous bug first, but if BU didn't lie in their attack report, there are malicious actors waiting to act upon every bug report before nodes can upgrade. Going partly-closed source can be justified in that case.
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:41:29
It's a smart and arguably the best way to go about it. There's just one stone block on the road.
What is the incentive for the ultra-conservative, or ultra-lazy miner to upgrade? 
- Yes, he may agree the new software has important improvements, but as it's a soft-fork, he knows he can continue competing for the block reward with his legacy 12.x software and not bother. Really, why would he bother? Upgrading takes effort and time but the rewards will be all the same regardless of software.
- Hard-fork would create a real incentive - if he doesn't get his arse off the couch to upgrade, he will end up mining the minority chain. Even the laziest 12.0 ChiCHuCha's will wake up to that. The only problem here is creating enough consensus and confidence about the best solution before the roads split apart.
I am not a major stakeholder, but not a 0-stake-reddit-troll either. It's a common belief that those who prefer HF have no real stake in the game. My personal stake is 200 XBT and I do not intend to cash out any time soon. Not a big boy, but not a 5-euro fanboy either. I do prefer HFs (just wanted to clarify)
@_date: 2017-01-09 12:11:16
There are massive debates on this. Many facts and many opinions alike. Every opinion raises counterarguments until everything ends in an insult war on a personal level.
Softforks are the way to go, BUT not when we are talking about large-scale and/or non-optional changes such as SegWit. SegWit is not an optional feature because LN as well as SchnorrSig as well as many other future improvements directly depend on it.
Some of the arguments against soft forks are code complexity, increased risk of a major bug (due to bulkier code), but what is standing in the way right now is LACK OF INCENTIVE TO UPGRADE.
- **Lack of incentive to upgrade**: Although we may safely assume at least 80% of community does support SegWit, only 25% of hash rate is actively supporting the feature activation. Miners do not care enough to upgrade as there's no immediate reward, instead, there's immediate loss as a node cannot provide hashing rate to a pool while it's being upgraded (financial loss).
- How do you incentivize? Push the fhker into a minor chain (release a hard fork). We can achieve 95% SegWit support with a hard fork , but never with a soft fork, unless other means of compensation is invented for the effort of upgrading (cookies and beer perhaps?). New massive SegWit-signalling mining centers? DDoS the non-signalling miners? All great options, but perhaps HF is the best on ethical grounds.

@_date: 2017-01-09 04:35:44
Ok BashCo. Then please explain this. 
Why nearly after 2 months only 25% of blocks signal the support, and the upwards trend is no longer there? (We have just a bit more than 10 months to go in that proposal cycle)
- Are the 75% not confident because of strong anti-SW politics going on? 
- Do they still have a bit of grilled turkey left from the holidays, still very busy, not yet able to upgrade?
You also twist the words a bit. I also see that SF is completely fine for optional features, but everyone must stop acting like SegWit IS an optional feature in the Core's roadmap. It's an essential necessity for many of the future developments, so an eventual HF would be completely acceptable for the given release.

Doesn't sound too crazy as all banks are obliged under AML/KYC/ATF to "implement strict policies". That also means pestering their customers about cash transactions, regardless if it's a *big* withdrawal or a *big* deposit.

Didn't specify, but by my understanding hub is not exactly the same as node.
If they just run a LN node to accept payments, they themselves can only get their customer payments via a hub, 'a next-gen bank' as I like to call it. To be a hub, they actually need to invest into opening channels themselves with other 'strategic partners' to make it economically worthwhile for end-user to connect to them directly - without any intermediaries. This kind of payments processing business is very different than just running a LN node

Yes, that's true, particularly in short-term, I expect main relief to come due to mining pool reward distribution relocating to L2. There's too much semi-spam that negatively impacts 99% of blocks found - a pool pays thousands of its own miners for their contribution of hash rate. Prioritizing their own 0-fee transactions over real Bitcoin payments that have a fee on them.

Given your sample, LN can have it's uses which also make economical sense for 1-time, 2-time and n-time payments. But you definitely cannot miss that this kind of network involves hubs, the payment processors.
In any case, as I already said, I'm out. Does LN help to relieve congestion and make Bitcoin transactions cheaper? Sure. Do I think this will help attract more users to Bitcoin? No. I don't think many would appreciate a Bitcoin where the economic way of paying someone involves going via an intermediary that may or may not require KYC, depending on jurisdiction. Maybe I'm making a completely bad judgement call but I'm all out. 0.00 XBT

A bit surprised it took so long to see first official renege.
Why proceed with a fork that was meant to keep 1 united chain? The chain has split; we all know 1 united chain is no longer a possibility.

95% Signalling support within a year is an impossibility. Next proposal should be a SegWit with a hard fork with a block-size increase - that would be more acceptable for the broader audience. I guess if that doesn't pass either, then Bitcoin is headed for a big decline of interest over time as it comes clearer it's not a scalable payment system (even if the solutions are in place, they must first be activated for any real benefit).

- You pay to open a channel. Possibly as much as $100 for a single on-chain TX at one point
- You would only open a channel to a well-connected hub, never to a single store/cafe/supermarket, unless they operate a hub themselves
- The 'next-gen bank' will likely charge a monthly fee to its customers in return for reimbursing the $100 on-chain fee. Better for customer acquisition
- Middlemen to transact in Bitcoin will be introduced for the common folk. Users will pick middlemen and transact in L2 because it makes economical sense over high cost on-chain TXs
- The common folk can freely pick among the 'next-gen banks', so there's no monopoly. That's a plus
- Furthermore, the common folk can continue freely transacting on-chain, if they find $100 fee per TX acceptable. That's a plus too
- Wish you best of luck. Happy if some will find it useful model for Bitcoin transacting, but I'm out.

Answer to your title, no. 
But if you think SegWit on top of 1MB block size will be enough to make any good use out of LN for 1-time or 2-time payments to same recipient, you're not a software engineer.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:38:52
I've done a bit of reading. Not sure if all is correct.
Nevertheless, in mesh network, 1 time and 2 time payments are impossible in any scenario. They do not make economical sense over on-chain transactions.
LN in mesh network with no hubs is interesting for recurring payments between same parties - mining pool reward distribution, paying your landlord for rent, electricity bills, etc. So basically 3 payments by minimum to reach economic benefit over on-chain TXs

It's just clear HODLing has been the winner since April 1st until today. With mining, sure, you may eventually get the 50 coins back but it's getting increasingly more difficult. If Bitcoin price doubles again, the hardware is worth half of what it's worth today, and double price also attracts more fortune seekers, resulting in increased mining difficulty and decreased rewards from mining. Miners have a saying that rewards from mining halve every 3 months, not 4 years (in terms of BTC produced per TH/s).

2. Use all 50 XBT to buy Antminer S9 (most efficient today). For purchase, pick any date between 1 April and yesterday.
3. Mine until today, and then sell all your Antminer S9s for Bitcoin. Let's assume you find a buyer who pays you 100% of original cost in USD value.
Assuming you converted 50 Bitcoins into S9 miners on April 1; mined at 100% pool luck; mined at 0 cost;  sold all your miners for Bitcoin on secondary market today for their original price in USD value; you would have turned 50 bitcoins into 38 bitcoins

Why would anybody burn their CPU's to accumulate worthless nerd internet money, something like Bitcoin in 2009 and early 2010? Speculative mining still exists to this day. See any new altcoins with no significant fiat value as they come to exist - why would anyone in their right mind mine those with their GPUs instead of something profitable like Ethereum?
From logic perspective, your statement makes perfect sense but that's not how everybody chooses their coin to mine

Bitcoin Cash has not yet done a good job attracting infrastructure apart from miners. BTC's network effect is far stronger and even having dual-chain support from 95% merchants is something very far away. With that said, BCH has far better survivability properties. BTC would not survive 95% sudden hash rate drop without an emergency hard fork, but BCH has done it twice already.

SegWit2x supporter too. Unfortunate that Core Devs are butthurt over 2x fork. There's absolutely no need to splinter XBT side further over disagreement. The only reason I'm not switching to BCH right now is hope the 2x fork in November will go smoothly. I will evaluate the odds again in October and act accordingly.

True. Signatories of NYA should re-gather for a follow up meeting to revise this agreement based on new information, completely different circumstances compared to late May this year.

There's no attack. It's market re-evaluating the situation
Does 7K Bitcoin make sense? The final release of Lightning Network is possibly 1.5 years away, and an entire new layer 2 is in development to sit in between on-chain and LN. 2 years to see what comes out of it? Basically Bitcoin is a risky ICO project now. Nobody will give refunds if this doesn't work out. Many find that betting on bigger blocks right now is the safer bet.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:33:53
Exactly. Demanding something from volunteers does not even work. L2/L3 project may look good on paper but nobody will know if it even delivers desired results in real world. Holding Bitcoin is now like being a stakeholder in an ICO project. Frequent status updates in such multi-year projects are a "must" to prevent excess bleeding. I think it's in Core devs interest to provide frequent progress updates as failing to do so may result in loss of market leader position for Bitcoin.

A rough guess of 0.5MB inc per year ought to be good enough. I don't think you can really argue that this will not be good enough for the next 15 years.
Another way to look at the issue:
1. Before LN implementation - whenever the avg TX fee of an avg TX of 226 bytes exceeds $5, the block size must be increased, regardless of other risks involved.
2. After LN implementation - same as above, but $25 instead of $5.

All low cost, and portable full nodes will probably die with current 1MB consensus anyway. Predict no more than 10 years lifetime for a $500 laptop as full node. Can be achieved with external storage, but only a very few and determined would care to go through the hassle.
Possibility to self-audit old blocks will be for the privileged, and those who do no mind either full or partial 3rd party trust. Probably 99% pruned nodes + external trust for verification of legacy blocks is what we'll end up with.

2nd. Solution is ideal. It's configuration can be developed to be a part of initial wallet setup.
I'd also prefer a fail safe solution to ensure no Bitcoins can ever die out completely, so 21M are always usable. By that, I mean a general consensus rule which renders coins to be a "public domain" (subject to be mined away by miners) i.e. after 100 years of no activity.

There's no investment for profit involved in cloud mining.

What you said about tax exemption in certain cases for U.S LLCs which are managed and controlled outside U.S is true. But it's not my point.
I studied international tax affairs for 4 years, and fairly confident a simple thing as an Apache web server on U.S soil establishes tax residency even if you live outside U.S and if your company has no U.S customers, and if it's registered in another country. This has been proven with court judgments.
So take an example. Bob permanently lives and manages his web-based business in The Netherlands. He chose to host his web-site in Amazon Cloud in U.S East area.
 - He has a customer from Brazil buy something from his web-site. Since the sale was made through a permanent U.S establishment (a web-server), he fully owes U.S corporate tax of 35% on the profit (TDA treaty rate as specified in U.S-NL agreement may or may not reduce it).
Court has judged that a web-server (whether virtual or not) is the same as a physical factory. It's just very hard to enforce this in practice.

BCC side is very united, they know exactly what they want. But if SegWit2x side splinters further due to disagreement regarding 2x part of NYA, then BCC has a real chance of coming out on top. I'd recommend to rally behind SegWit2x which got us the SegWit in the first place.

One does not have to write Bitcoin consensus to prove himself in cpp. There are other prominent projects out there, such as Linux Kernel.
Despite so many bashing the code quality, all the issues opened in btc1 are political, cosmetic, or opinionated (up to personal preference).
Why not open an issue in btc1 repo? Offer your own version to replace a poorly written function. Show a heads-up test spec of your function vs Garzik 's function. Prove that your code is better at solving a particular problem. Prove that he produces crappy code.

Momentary discomfort is a sure thing. A miner can mine (propagate) as soon as a block is found at the height of wipeout protection, but if he cannot make that block bigger than 1MB, it's a guaranteed orhpan on SegWit2x chain. Much better to stall until valid TXs are available. But I agree, the risk of entering into orphan war is too great after 30 minutes of stalling. After 30 minutes, it makes sense to generate your own fictional 0 fee spam in favor of further stalling.
Regardless, all of the above is speculation on something of marginal importance. Most likely outcome (95%+ chance for shure!) there will be enough TXs in mempool to create that &gt;1 MB block out of legitimate transactions.
@_date: 2017-07-12 08:59:41
You're making an assumption that all users will be as aware as a power user. Even if Bitcoin lost 80% of it's users, there will be enough transactions in mempool to create 2MB blocks out of non-zero fee TXs waiting in mempool.

Comes down to DTA (Double Taxation Agreement) as negotiated between U.S and NL. The nature of such agreements often makes both countries eligible to cash in around 50% of their usual rate. In this case, a DTA exists, so the total would be no more than 40%.
If there were no DTA, it would indeed be 35% owed to U.S, and then of what is remaining, NL would be able to cash in the arbitrary 40% assuming no Tax Credit eligibility (exception on sums already paid to another country).

"90+% of users probably don't want it so there will be no economy"
No. 91% of users asked for hard fork for a block size increase. Check out luke's poll, or bitcoin.com polls. Luke himself said "it's not possible to proceed" because the 9% is more than enough opposition to ditch the idea. There's some kind of belief the consensus has to be close to 100%, something which SegWit itself never had.
The safest idea now is to rally behind SegWit2x, and not make stupid arguments to fight against 2x fork. That's when the XBT stands strongest against BCC takeover.

What is overwhelming majority? 95% Of miners, users and businesses? SegWit never had that much support from any. UASF/BIP148, SegWit/BIP141, BU, SegWit2x, XT, Classic - all must be labelled 'an attack' based on the same standards.

SegWit2x also involves a soft fork of SegWit. I'm not 100% sure Jihan will go through with SegWit2x activation as promised. However, I doubt he'd go that far to sign an agreement with key industry players to activate SegWit just to raise his middle 'veto' finger at the very last moment. If he wanted to do that, just waiting idle until August 1 would have achieved the same stalling result with less damage to his 'reputation'.

Jihan initially supported SegWit. He told that he lost his trust in Core because Greg Maxwell has a public opinion and a private opinion. 
According to Jihan, in face to face meetings, Greg and other leading figures of Core told they definitely support hard fork to bigger blocks after SegWit activates. Meanwhile in public, Greg spent hours arguing for the opposite spectrum. He made it very clear he will not vouch for any hard fork for block size increase. Greg is the reason we have to move forward with a SegWit2x hard fork bundle instead of going BIP141 first. At least this is what miners and businesses who were optimistic about HK agreement are now asking for.

Fictional transactions are only needed if there won't be enough transactions in the entire mempool, including the zero /near-zero fee ones. In worst case scenario, blockchain of SegWit2x will have a mining break  until enough transactions in mempool are available to create a 1.1 MB block. Of-course, if it happens, the very first delayed block will likely be found by more than one pool, resulting in an orphan war between multiple participants.

Interesting findings. Has this been confirmed as a critical vulnerability , usable for funds theft by Trezor? As the code running on hardware wallets is very thin, it is not as susceptible to bugs and vulnerabilities.

If you want to be safe with your hardware wallet.
1. Hardware signature device: never update the firmware after the initial setup. No matter how fancy the new features or enhancements, you do not need to ever update it. It's a signature-providing device, and that's all it should be used for. (If you are really paranoid and have millions at stake, have the current version of source code reviewed by an expert as you do your initial setup.)
2. Web or local wallet: Updates are nothing to be concerned of. Any possible backdoors cannot be used to steal your funds. Just don't update the firmware of your hardware wallet and you're good.

It would make sense to at least support withdrawal of forked coins (if possible). The real possibility to withdraw really depends on whether or not enough blocks are generated every 24 hours. If there are 0 blocks per 24 hours, there's nothing other than "stealing" an exchange can do. They are non-portable brick coins which cannot be moved, so demanding a withdrawal is asking a pig to fly. Waste of time.
On the other hand, if UAHF constantly mines lets say 1-5 blocks per 24 hours, I'd say asking for an eventual support for ForkCoin withdrawal is nothing too crazy. Every exchange should either support, or compensate for lack of support.

SegWit2x makes the most sense. I'm asking every non-hopeless, non-radicalized Bitcoiners to rally behind it. UASF on Aug 1 followed by UAHF would be an epic shitstorm for all chains. It's essentially a war where there can be no winners apart from alt coins who stay out of it.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:37:21
UAHF contingency plan can be an attempt at demonstration of strength. The terms they outlined are unacceptable even for the like-minded big blockers. If it were just a plan to eliminate re-org risk and introduce bigger blocks, it would be an effective counter punch at UASF. Problem is that the plan introduces irrelevant scraps of rotten fish that nobody asked for.
I don't see why would any other mining pool be OK with following a chain which was private and pre-mined by a single pool for 72 hours.
- Complete loss of decentralization and security for 3 days
- All block rewards gifted to a single entity with no mining competition whatsoever

Quite a bit of hassle due to having to manage many addresses. As a freelance IT contractor, I had one incident where an on-site specialist found out my daily rate. Surely, he was a bit upset and complained to his manager about the lack of his own compensation. My agency fined me for 50% of the monthly rate.
Needless to say, I now create a unique receive address for every invoice, and use another set of addresses for the daily personal-use expenditure. (Totaling at 147 unique addresses at this point, each with some BTC). Of course, it's a needless amount of bulk on the blockchain but I haven't found a better way to retain some privacy and also have some amount of control over my accounting.

They are dedicated to SegWit2x roadmap. Also, ASICBOOST has nothing to do with speeding up the ASIC units. If they use it, only their electricity bill will be higher after it gets disabled.

Gaining support, but that support is still tiny when compared to SegWit or SegWit2x. 
Why would a non-welcoming company fill in "not acceptable" in this BS list? It's already seen as a UASF-praiser/SegWit2X hater list, not a definitive summary to see where the economic majority stands. Listing your company as a non-supporter just gets you in trouble with the UASF loonies.

If it's a block size increase, can we add more SegWits after the first one is done? Add another SegWit on top of the existing to increase capacity further? If it really is true that SegWit is a block size increase (literally), let's keep increasing block size by doing more and more SegWits on top of SegWits! No hard forks required, and we have an ideal road map for long term L1 scaling.
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:51:52
Do you mean I should pay attention to Core devs? I did, initially, but they are all echoing same opinions, as if the opinions came from a single 'strategic' source.
If we ignore everything else, the fact there's not a single member from Core dev team coming out in support of SegWit2x renders the whole team worthless as source of argumented opinions. Their opinions regarding alternative upgrade paths are not valuable nor credible. If it were a group of independent professionals, at least a few would argue SegWit2x is a better next step to take than SegWit.
And if you mean user consensus, FYI, users supported bigger blocks in 2015. Before SegWit was nothing but an idea. Today more than 90% of users support block size increase with a hard fork. Perhaps 75% support SegWit, but not more than that. And if there's a consensus metric that outweighs any polls, you will know exactly where consensus stands if you take a look at miner signalling.

- "segwit-only blocks will be full again in less than 10 months at historical growth rates"
**They will be full from day 1.**
Note that SegWit scaling benefit is 'ramp-up'. To achieve its 1.7x scaling factor, 100% of UTXOs must first be moved to SegWit addresses. This is unlikely to happen even after 10 years since activation. We can be happy if after 2 years of activation we get 70% of UTXOs to SegWit addresses. That's the main reason why I prefer SegWit2x over SegWit as standalone soft fork. We'll get immediate alleviation to congestion.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:49:01
And Bitcoin businesses who support SegWit2x are lunatics? Some of these companies employ developers who make $200k and more annually which is a pretty strong indicator they do have access to technical competence. There's nothing radical about SegWit2x. 
It is a "scientific" certainty that a block size larger than 1MB is required sooner or later if we want to achieve any significant scale. We don't need to argue over it, it's as clear as law of gravity.

With less than 1% of hash power behind BIP148, there's no reason to panic sell. I am HODLing too. BIP148 I might want to sell, if it's worthwhile, and if it's possible to get your BIP148 coins on an exchange in the first place. Perhaps the confirmation times will be too slow for this to work.

You should go for a SegWit2x compliant node from the start. If you go with UASF or SegWit-only node, you will fork yourself off once the 2MB blocks are produced by miners supporting SegWit2x.
