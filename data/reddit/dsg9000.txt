I agree, problem is however that the great majority are in hoping to get rich quickly.
The “spenders” off bitcoin will be those who withdraw it back to Fiat after a price rise to make a purchase.
It’s not how it’s meant to be, the functionality that made bitcoin is missing and it needs to be fixed or it will be superseded.

Yeah lol. End of the day being forced and being sold yield the same result.

Exactly right, guess they get a lot of signups being the way to sell BTC easily in Australia 
Better off buying in something else and moving it over

Yeah I think the “killer app” will be the first coin to not visibly be a blockchain application. In this way the masses could use it without realising so and thus not needing to think about the technical aspects of their finances. 
This is the reality for fiat providers currently, quality of the system is assumed safe or good and feature/performance wins.
I would say a killer app doesn’t exist yet, we are still too low level in the technology for mass adoption.

Yes further to this you can easily check their open source projects [ 
Also with Azure running a large amount of Linux distro servers in the world you will be using services served by Linux from Microsoft
Security in mind, as end users or Administrators I can guarantee we make more security vulnerabilities in our general use of any system unless it’s something we spend a lot of time learning about and implementing.
