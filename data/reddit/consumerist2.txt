Seems Cryptsy might have been a ponzi scheme and they were using your bitcoins to invest in more coins but the price has fallen too much for them to pay out their customers. Right now you have to find their number and call them and threaten action before other people start to do that. Whoever can pull out first wins in a ponzi scheme and you might have just lost. :(

I do believe the bottom will be at $265 as that will drive people to buy more coins. Your view seems to show the worst case scenario such as one guy dumping 30k coins at once.

Nah. Just like MtGoX was not being boted to over $1000 illegally.

Free market means you do not have to join if you can't hold yourself together.

I've seen an analysis showing a drop down to $242 which I don't believe. I think $260 is our bottom personally from watching the market.

The only times I hear of a person not being able to withdraw is when the company is falling and they will try stalling you. Others might be clogging up their email with requests to withdraw and if you get out then be glad you did. Most often these people just close up shop and start again.
One great example was MtGoX where for two months before they closed shop was a time people could deposit but no one could withdraw. This was two months before they failed. Get out and hold the coins on a better market or even better hold onto them in your own wallet.

The easiest way is to sell them on a craiglist like site called localbitcoins.com but this only works best if you live in a major metropolis area. If you are living in a low population area get him to give you real fiat as selling them on an exchange will be too much hassle for someone who is new to this and can take you a week to finish after you send in all your paperwork.
