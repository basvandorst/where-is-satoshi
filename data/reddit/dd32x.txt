Calm down and articulate your self better. What you exactly you trying to do?
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:53:43
Thats what they are trying to solve, some think implementing a network in top of the chain solves this. Others think increasing the block size solves this scaling problem.
Because of that we now have:
Bitcoin with Segwit, and Bitcoin with Segwit2x (in few months)
Bitcoin with bigger blocks, also known as Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:41:06
Aug 8th segwit activates, some people think that due to massive volume of bitcoin transactions it might clog the network, others that if not carefully implemented might fuck up the chain. Who knows, maybe all be ok, segwit is already running in litecoin, but that doesn't guarantee it should work on others, applying this updates is risky, altering the chain is not an easy task, anything could go wrong. A lot of people don't know shit about these things and started celebrating with memes when bitcoin passes the 3,000 valuation, thanking segwit, when in reality is not operating yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:35:04
I think thats the fear and big question. Operating at a loss, to what end?
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:22:12
You sell if you need the fiat money, if don't, store it secure your keys and forget about it. I bet the kid that spent 10,000 bitcoin in a Pizza would appreciate an advise like this 7 years ago.

Why covering the qty?. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:48:32
Thats plain stupid, Roger Ver never said dump your BTC, he even admitted he is holding same amount of BTC and BCC. Don't believe all the fairy stories and posts. Everybody has an agenda use your own judgement.

Nah, will still be in 3-4th biggest market place.But l I hope to go down to $200/300 to buy more  ��
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:19:44
blockfolio is the most used, but it lags a little bit behind current prices. However it gets the job done.
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:04:29
Holding Bitcoin Cash is the most wise thing to do, people that rush selling it will regret it later on.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:42:02
People are clueless, market correction, miners support, eclipse. All I can think off is, since a backlog of bitcoin transactions are piling up to a point is getting noticed, and the notion of bitcoin miners almost moved 40% of hashing power to the forked coin, these are contributing to a loss of trust in the short term. Maybe they'll come back once Segwit is activated. Or when miners move back. Who knows,
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:08:26
Not my data. Everybody is using coin dance for this metric. Not Luke Jr  website. I should it said miners instead of nodes. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:32:19
Cheaper Bitcoin Cash! Yes!
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:22:03
Segwit is just the beginning for more controversy. Expect another split in November
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:01:17
What bitcoins you want to claim? BCC? Did you dowloaded the Electrum Bitcoin Cash version? Good. Wait till the fork concludes. You should see balance using same key you are using for electrum BTC

You know how many memes are out there that don't make sense and only promote hatred and confusion. I care less about people in the in the picture but things like these just show only how ignorant we can be, instead of working together to growth our favorite version of the coin while respect others opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:46:04
Don't matter, its oficial name is bitcoin cash, its stupid calling it bcash because you have tantrum. They fucked up, and corrected it. Just move on dude. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:44:37
FUD. Litecoin suffered same thing during its activation. Bump when locked in, dumped when activated. Who the hell understand the market logic....
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:46:53
These guys, do't know what they are talking about. Right now BCH is faster and cheaper than BTC. And with more miners, it will make it more secure and accepted. Price will go up eventually. All these haters want it to die, suck it up and drive on bullies.

Which coin?
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:57:29
Careful what you wish for, same analogy could apply to the forked coin and create a black swan scenario. Lets hope not. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:47:32
Lol. Individual bitcoin mining is not lucrative anymore due to the difficulty. China has mega factories of mining that individual people cant compete with. I would use the money thou in the crypto market. Research different cryptos and make you own judgment on which one deserve your money or have a potential.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:23:47
You can't probably, check their twitter and announcement page, they most likely halt trading and freeze wallets, while BTC forks concludes. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:26:29
Doesn't look like it. Jimmy Song is discussing this live at 
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:47:03
Evidently you have no idea how the blockchain and mining works. Mining power right now is only few companies, this was well known and expected, the reason why is slow now its because the difficulty and block discovery hasn't keep up with the hashing power. BTC forked was to provide a safety net for miners and some developers community that don't support segwit, and can't upgrade hardware and software to keep up with Segwit2x. Segwit2x agenda is to shrink mining companies to a few, and that my friend is against decentralization, you don't want to believe it now, but think 5 years and only 4 companies maintaining the network, can basically drive the future of the coin at their will. 
I don't hold Bitcoin Cash, but I am not stupid enough to not realize this. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:46:32
Whats bcash?
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:02:23
Yes, where do you have it? Most exchanges supported the split, even coinbase, but will release balance on January 2018.
And local, your private key can unlock the balance in bitcoin cash chain, all you need is a bitcoin cash wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:28:44
There is a whole concept behind of how this can replace money in the future, plus it helped to sell it. But yeah, basically scarcity and demand its what fuels the price now. Price is so high that is too hard to ignore from Bankers, Institutional Investors, and Merchants. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:13:04
I really want to know! The plot tickens....

Last two paragraphs:
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:29:27
Yeah but the difficulty change is less than 24 hours away to happen on the forked coin. Miners should start moving back to bitcoin chain by now. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:57:19
You read it wrong, he is talking about the bad points of bitcoin cash currently in its form vs the updates in Bitcoin, that supposedly will make it cheap and fast, but with a catch. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:35:55
I asked the same... 
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:24:52
So, you mean people wanting to buy, are not buying LTC on coinbase, sending it to Bittrex, selling it for BTC and buying BCC/BCH?
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:17:24
You bet! Make no mistake, the reason Bitcoin Cash exist is for safety net for miners that can't or will have issues during the upgrade. Influential actors in the social media scene are not telling you this, because they want to benefit from the fork the best they can. By manipulating perception to Bitcoin backers and new comers.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:32:08
But market price at bitcoin cap valuation the drop is way way more impacting, from 4,400 to 3,750, Bitcoin should be going up not retracting like that. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:09:10
True, but I don't think the new coins will really matter to cause hyperinflation. We at this point don't even know how many can or will use their bitcoin cash from the fork, or how many people lost bitcoins in the early days. The circulating supply is speculative because of this. At this point oscillation is more harmful to bitcoin than anything else, Bitcoin Cash can just bump in price by people thinking they are buying bitcoin, the higher the value the more damage do to BTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:15:43
Nah. Miners didn't moved back, plus BCC is being used purely for trading at this point. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:52:45
It was believed miners would be coming back after the diff adjustment in BCH. At this point we don't know their motives, since they are losing short term gains while mining in BCH. Maybe they know something we don't.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:58:51
Hahaha. No
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:43:00
You lost me here:
"Meanwhile, the altcoin is wrestling with its own precarious difficulty situation"
If you been monitoring coin dance since Aug 1st, you can see that difficulty is actually decreasing and mining profitability is rising against the main chain, at this rate in two weeks at the most, Bitcoin Cash network will be more profitable to mine than Bitcoin Core/Segwit
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:22:02
Thats the plan, at the end of the day we care only for buying, spending and trading. They (Big Miners) are a business, and they will always yield to whats best for the business, that doesn't necessarily mean the best for us.
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:55:33
In Bitcoin Cash the difficulty adjust to market prices. This is known as EDA. This enhancement is currently not supported in current Bitcoin with Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:35:45
Nope he didn't, he said in an interview he is holding the same amount of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. He didn't became wealthy by selling bitcoins.

Im pretty sure they announced they were halting BTC operations until the fork was completed. Just check their announcements page or twitter. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:21:37
You can sell your BCC for BTC in Bittrex right now. But the BCC wallet its under maintenance, you will have to wait until the open it, to transfer BCC balance.
Only the people that left their BTC in Bittrex during the fork and got BCC are the one trading right now. (and of course, people sending LTC ,selling to BTC, and buying BCC, in the mean time, since BTC wallet is also offline)
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:31:17
Segwit2x, probably, but in November

@_date: 2017-08-06 01:15:37
The answer is, you hold BTC for ever. Bitcoin will be the "De Facto" storage of value of the world. Decentralized Payment System Approach is no longer the main focus. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:15:41
Not in the short term. Conditions for that weird scenario that make it happen are no longer. (BTC and BCC wallets offline, split in the exchange, not enough mining capacity to process transfers to wallet when open)
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:09:20
Yes, cause the miners wants segwit with 2mb block (segwit2x) Developers told them yes if first they update their mining equipment to support segwit. After miners locked in segwit. Developers change their minds, and update the code to reject segwit2x blocks in the chain. Miners felt betrayed and threaten to perform a miners activation fork, with a bitcoin that supports segwit2x only. The split is expected to happen in November if nothing changes. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:21:54
But at what cost? $5000 could turn in to $1000 in a blink of an eye. We are all confident nothing will stop BTC growth. We just need to be cautious. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:42:35
Not to Rogers defense, cause I really don't care, I just want to know people's opinion, but he probably owns more bitcoin than the whole community here. I am pretty sure that he wants more than anything bitcoin to succeed. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:54:04
Its been postponed for Wednesday, some miners pulled 33% of BTC hashing power in to BCC extending the initial date predicted for the accorded block# to activate.
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:18:22
No you got it wrong. The end is, we have no fucking clue what the future is going to be. If you are smart enough, hold your BCC, until all problems are resolved.

The beginning of bitcoin not being a bitcoin anymore with promised of fast transaction speed in the long run but at a cost. Get ready for a second bitcoin fork, segwit locked in opens the door for segwit2x in november. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:26:41
I fear its because the supply its controlled for now. Only trading BCC of the people that forked in the exchange. BTC and BCC wallets are still offline for transfers. Once they open, the horde of holders will bring the price to the floor.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:03:07
Because he is an investor, and all smart investors, hold equal amount, after the split. He didn't became millionaire by selling Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:54:57
Yes, almost 43% of the power is being used on another chain for now. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:25:06
Lol, I want to buy more, but will wait for segwit2x drama. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:02:29
It shouldn't, I agree, and I can see thats the plan in the long run. I hope is not too late. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:58:05
No, everybody is accountable to do research and understand whats happening, its a free market,  people have made mistakes and sent and lost tokens to different wallets for being clumsy and not paying attention of what they are doing, the tech is new and far from perfect but the warnings are everywhere on how to make sure you transfer to the correct wallet, there are more tokens out there with bitcoin name than bitcoin cash. Its your responsibility to research this before making a transfer. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:35:38
Thats bad taste video for a joke. People died in that space ship. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:25:24
Because they want to take fees control away from miners. And control the fees via offchain solutions, cause otherwise these offchain solutions wont work with out having a fee structure. Problem with this is that you open the gate for corporate control as companies will want to provide services to bitcoin by charging transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:46:15
I think is November. Just get ready to see another split. Cause the community still divided. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:07:41
Google is your friend. But no. Trezor supports BCC (BCH) and pretty sure many others.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:59:34
Btc is profitable again right now, the fees and latency problem is a different issue. Might be resolved now or next year, there is no sense of urgency to make bitcoin like it was in the past. They are working on it. An update should activate in few days (segwit), but nobody knows how much will help. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:26:13
Its good for understanding how bitcoin begun, and why is so popular, and how network regulators tried to screw it over, and later built consulting firms for the law they created. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:35:33
Yeah man, I hear you, but there is a fork in the wild  hard to ignore, sucking bitcoin computing power, a staggering 36% with indications of going to 40% soon. The fork was expected to die with out much noise, now I see why all attacks to it in social media, its no joke.

Lighting Network is to work with segwit, in essence is just the plugin for it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:03:53
Maybe, maybe not. Litecoin got its price bumped when segwit was locked in, but dropped when it was activated. I don't think segwit solves the scaling issue instantaneously, but its the stepping stone for side chains and other proposed off chain solutions in the long run. We just have to wait and see if users are going to be patience enough to keep paying high fees until side chains network arrives. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:14:07
Google is your friend.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:51:38
Good luck with that. Sounds like a lot of BTC holder are scare of BTC devaluation. I'm not an expert, and wish the best for every coin supporter, but i've seeing a lot of people saying the oposite, Bitcoin Cash has the original code, just bigger block, while Bitcoin has mutated and will mutate again.
Isn't Bitcoin going to fork again with segwit2x?

Not there yet, there is still another fork possible in November with Segwit2x
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:08:32
Not sure you want to advertise a bitcoin mining facility or what ever you have. Its actually a bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:04:59
I'll believe it when nodes stop signaling for segwit2x. As off today, 91.8% are "lock and loaded" for 2x:

@_date: 2017-08-22 04:45:15
Problem with that is that, as far as I read in here, implementing EDA method will have to be under a fork. Can't be as simple as a code update to the current version. Not sure this is correct, but it was already discussed. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:48:31
I don't think segwit help with the fees, but speed. Core understanding is that a fee structure is necessary to support offchain solutions IMHO.

Bitcoin Cash massive dump and loss in market share.
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:39:24
Its not locked in yet. And once it does, its most likely 2 weeks from locking date to give time to everybody that submitted intention, upgrade their systems. Its 100% but that doesn't mean its lock, needs 400 more blocks to go.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:57:22
I failed to understand where you lost $85
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:24:10
5% for someone holding hundreds or thousands of BTC its quite a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:00:39
LOL, you think BCC is an ICO, and everybody needs to dump it. Look at the market cap, I think its here to stay. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:16:02
Regret what? you got a free coin and its way too early to say if the problems in the BTC chain will be resolved, Segwit2x will cause another fork, and there is no indication it will not happen. Even most smart people and analyst are not dumping, on the contrary holding until there is a clear indication.
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:42:10
If you been following the fork and the events that lead to it, you'll see heavy weight influencers denying calling it bitcoin cash, but calling it bcash to lure people away of what it really is, the original bitcoin. They will tell you the fork was an attempt to hijack the project, when in reality they are the ones hijacking the project adding 2nd layers to the protocol when the paper says increase the block for scaling. Calling it bcash is just a guerrilla marketing tactic. No where in here says Bcash  
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:48:25
I just wanted you to describe it, so you read how stupid you sound �� 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:47:36
Nah, calm down, its just a market correction, it happens. You never know if or when the price dips. Just hold them. BTC will be value more than 5K at some point.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:16:41
Well, its how it works lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:49:53

@_date: 2017-08-09 00:18:03
Cause its was discussed during a live podcast waiting for segwit locked in. Now apparently people are aware of this tactics to manipulate price. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:03:16
None were needed to scale, just bump the blocks like the paper suggest. New people coming in new to the community got segwit and 2X sold with agendas to control the ecosystem scaling off chain, making others secure and grow their mining operation while killing competition, producing, run and sell segwit and 2x compatible hardware to maintain the chain. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:44:24
Indeed Wow
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:48:25
No, it is well known bitcoin hashing majority is centralized in china. But this is way better than only 2-3 companies holding all hashing power by killing competition with upgrades they can only afford. Again, this is not a concern now to many because we are counting lambos and stars in the moon, it can all fade away by greed, it happens to investors, it can happen to miners, and with that, taking down the network and a 50bn market cap with them.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:11:40
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:50:31
I think thats the plan. But I wonder if it will be possibly realized at current valuation. Making bitcoin something more modular come at a risk, the chain don't stop, you don't have maintenance windows, you have to implement updates, new approach and mods at the user experience cost. I agree, you can create the most advanced, technological and miner independent bitcoin out there, but if you don't listen to the users and give them what they want right now? I guarantee you bitcoin will go back again to be a hobby project, and miners will finally take over the project, the network and the market with their own vision.

Sure buddy. Right or wrong, segwit2x has 92% intention:  and if they don't withdraw, another bitcoin will born again, but backed up by the mining machinery. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:02:59
Segwit is not a fork, is an update to the code to support offchain solutions. Segwit2x however, will definitely be a fork in November.

Ah don't get me wrong, it will, have utility, don't expect to happen out of the blue, good thing is that it can be implemented same merchants accepting BTC. 
And honestly, I don't understand why all this hate for Bitcoin Cash, BTC market price was unaffected, and you got free coins out of a disagreement that you don't vote or have a voice. In my opinion the best thing to do is  hold it, it will find it space in the crypto market, like all the other coins that people believe in. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:10:49
Kicking out competition that can't upgrade current mining systems due to the cost involved. Right now is almost imposible to start a mining business, because they control the hashing power of the world. In the past an individual could mine and contribute to the network and profit. If you don't profit, there is no point in mining, and today thats not posible anymore.

Interesting theory. But the problem with all theories is that our models are based in thinking this is a close controlled market, and is not. More people every day are discovering cryptos, and putting their money where they think there is an opportunity, regardless of what is going on in the background with all the scaling drama and forks to come. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:03:06
Segwit is a network on top of the blockchain, for assistance with the transactions speed. This change the whole vision of what an open decentralized peer to peer cash system should be. Promoters with agendas want this due to the controlling nature and future profits this will lead. Users benefits with speed and probably lower fees, but with a cost of letting a selective group of people decides the direction and full control of the network. Mining bitcoin will keep shrinking to a selective group of people (companies). 
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:58:32
LN network is not the only project in the pipeline, you can bet some are or will be patented and even licensed to use. Blockstream is a for profit company, and its involvement in bitcoin is to monetize solutions and services.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:55:12
Yup, 2nd fork coming in November 
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:34:49
I think its on November, its not 100% sure it will happen, but if it does, there is a high chance of either another bitcoin split, or miners defecting to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Those guys (miners and developers has a lot of drama issues and disagreements.)We traders are just observers in the side line, investors with no vote.

Yeah Ive read that article before. It wont happen in my opinion. Miners will not kill the main chain by jumping around they know this. I think this hashing swap, other than economical reasons, is more of a muscle demonstration of how much they can hurt if they are forced to go with another fork in November. Maybe its their way to bend core to their will of accepting segwit2x. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:50:09

So you haven't pay attention when Bitcoin was a 40bn market cap, and trading around $2,000 early this year? Once the segwit dilema and fork news started to be on the news it begin to increase. You wasn't paying attention when CNBC was talking about Hedge Funds and Investors getting in meetings, advised to invest in bitcoin? or You missed when Fidelity enabled their traders to follow bitcoin market price in their tool? It went from 40 to 120bn market cap in a year dude. Thats not hard to understand and realize. Computer Scientist thinks people are investing in their ideas on how to scale, but they dont give a damn about this, they just want to get in, make money, get out and repeat. Its all about trading and making money.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:26:45
Yup, they need to make the baby ready for the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:40:25
BTC surge was fueled by the fork, free money. Since no more fork, people now looking to diversify the profit while they can and Bitcoin Cash market cap has gone up billions in less dan a day.

Whats happening now is just a lot of traders hit a reality wall. Bitcoin run was fueled by forks, people wanting a airdrops. Now that is not happening, there’s a massive sell out, or BCH buyout.

Just review the last bitcoins rallies and what factors influenced the hype. Segwit, Bitcoin Cash Fork, Bitcoin Gold and 2X fork. Now that there is no 2X Bitcoin still back to square one with same issues that initiated the debate, until they solve the fees and slow transactions, I don’t see rallies like these happening anytime soon, and on the contrary might slower investment, and decrease value overtime. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:00:39
Miner control? Whats the use of Bitcoin if its slow and the code is intentionally set for fees to be ridiculous high?! The unconfirmed transactions are actually helping maintaining the price, cause these are headed to exchanges to cash out or to trade, now that the run fueled by free money is over.

If it become unsustainable there is no other choice but to fork 2X, and let 1X behind. Adam Back already twitted to Jihan this possibility is still open as a quick remedy. Some businesses uses Bitcoin daily as a medium of exchange, and are not happy with the fees and slow transactions.

Tell me how storing information off the chain is better than increase the memory for more transaction and historical data be allocated in a single place?

@_date: 2017-11-10 14:26:55
Same amount in BCH, not same value. All you need is the private key of the wallet you hold the BTC. Then download Electron Cash. The same ley of the bitcoin wallet will unlock your BCH balance. Send BCH to a BCH address on an exchange and sell for Bitcoin or any other trading pair, or pay your friends. Or just simply do nothing and hold.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:37:57
Why he should? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:14:53
BCH is hotter than BTC right now, and thats with out merchant support. Imagine when people can buy via their phones. The domino effect of sending quick transfers for cheap fees will resonate. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:20:04
We are just witnessing the next Bitcoin era. Funny all you need to do was to change the code to accept more blocks and wala, Bitcoin as its supposed to work for everybody! Ahh and don't lecture me about all that shinny tech that is in the works, complicated payment channels and side chains, lightning idea. Just take examples of things in life, Android is more modular than iPhone and can do way more things... Do people really care? No, they keep buying iPhones, because they fucking work with out reading a manual. Thats all users wants in Bitcoin, fast cheap transactions, with out complications, easy.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:12:30
I think thats a bad thing. People are moving to exchanges to sell or trade for BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:35:37
Bitstamp and etoro just enabled BCH trading, probably expecting surge after the fork and stability. When Bitcoin Cash hits coinbase it will be only but trouble.

Heres my two cents. Not long ago, Trace Mayer said in an interview, hold your keys, wait for all this dilema end and when there is a clear victor, then make a decision. A lot of people didn’t get the memo and now are panicking. If you bought bitcoin after Aug 1st, just diversify and hope for the best. If you got influenced by dumping bcash propaganda, then my friend, I feel sorry. This is a global phenomena and different cultures around the world have different opinions. Just look out for your self, and trust your feelings.  If it turns out a bad decision, at least you can feel good you trust in you, not in Bitcoin millionaires or social media bullies.

That has to be proven yet if POW with GPUs will maintain the growth and fast transaction plus if there will be merchant adoption, otherwise is just another segwit toy coin. Bitcoin upgraded to ASIC mining long time ago for a reason. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:18:57
Nah. Even if its true, he wont dump all at same time bringing down the market, not very wisely. But if that worries you, you should be more worry of Satoshi, its believe he owns millions of pre mined BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:51:33

Hardware wallets encrypts the private key, and its never revealed, you only use a pin code to unlock the wallet in any computer, with out the risk of a malware trying to record your keyboard types. The pin is done via clicks on a window. Trezor works like this. The number arrangement to click in the window is in random order, and you have to cross reference the position you click with the one revealed on the trezor display. There are few examples in youtube.

Massive dump of BCC for BTC. Most likely BTC losing value in the interim due to their brand been affected, make no mistake, this is a big mess, caused by people not setting up their differences and working together. Volatility across the board.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:23:25
Sounds like the app wont interact with BCC yet, so you might just check what wallets are BCC ready, and after the fork unlock your BCC with the keys you are using in electrum..
Is up to you if you want to send balance there before the fork, the transfer will cost you fees and last time I checked they are not cheap.
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:08:13
Lol. Bitcoin is no longer anonymous. Those days are gone. And its heavily centralized with asian miners. But other alts are taking care of the privacy issue, like zCash, Monero, Dash or PIVX.
I know it must sucks, but thats how exchange operates, specially the ones that accept bank and credit card accounts, are somehow regulate, and require full identity. Maybe that's why overstock need to use this process, in order to held somebody accountable (Coinbase), if anything goes wrong. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:05:10
With out knowing what addresses he is talking about we are just assuming. Again, LTC was a fork from Bitcoin, they have almost the same structure, but they don't talk to each other nor you can control balance from one to the other.

Every time a token forks it tarnish the brand, this is is well known, and we can look on other tokens that had similar forking fate in the past.

There is a backlog in BTC transactions, notice there is a big yellow banner notification saying this in their desktop website.

@_date: 2017-07-30 01:53:38
Some cases will accept the transfer because of the address format is the same. Litecoin was a fork of bitcoin in 2011. But they will be lost because of being independent block chains.

Being hard to acquire makes it more valuable.

It is amusing why people think that creating a coin out of thin air, by borrowing users and mining power, will not affect the other one, and in the contrary, will do well and just create a multi billion dollar market, out of the blue, and everything will be fine.

Like asking a bank how much money they are storing. Not going to happen gab.
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:44:03
Yes, unfortunately with Aug 1st being so close, it will probably take days for them to process a refund. Maybe next business day they will respond, just have a wallet address ready. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:47:44
Yup, you waited till close to Aug 1st to send BTC to local wallet. Its like 300,000 people trying yo get in to a train every time. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:02:20
Nope, just use the same key for your wallet on a wallet for BCC. Your BTC key is the same for your BCC, just need to find what wallet will interact with the BCC blockchain.

If you can get it from the vendor, I would, you save money. Amazon is a resellers market.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:10:50
The wallet interacts with the blockchain, you own the key on private wallets, the fork will just copy the whole blockchain as it is, (including keys). Since wallet has balance, it will have the same balance in BCC blockchain. All you need to do, is use the key of your BTC wallet with balance, and import it on a BCC wallet, and walla! You see the same BTC balance but in BCC.
Why you need on your wallet before the fork? Because its like a copy paste, if you have 0, it will copy 0.

Be aware, once you set up the trezor, backup your seed in a paper, and all that, you will interact with the protected wallet via the trezor.io website. You will need to transfer your balance from electrum to the trezor protected wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:14:07
They safe but you wont get BCC. BTC need to be off coinbase to get it once the chain splits.
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:34:15
Can we also stop calling them coins? They are not coins or currency, they are tokens. �� /sarcasm 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:33:37
Maybe anybody willing to sell for cash? If you looking for an exchange like gemini, you are out of luck, most of exchanges requires to be authenticated to buy and trade, and it takes days to process your info. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:57:43
Well, I don't see a problem with that. Means retailers has a partnership with exchanges which is good for adoption. Plus you can covert to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:16:23
They should transfer the balance back to the address it was sent from. Or you can supply them with a new address you want BTC to be sent. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:46:12
I honestly don't understand what you talking about. Unless you are mining, trading, or some friend sent it to you, the only way to get BTC is from Fiat via exchange, thats why BTC value is so high, cause its hard to get one, and its scarce. And yes, the exchange will require full identity to deliver its service to you, thats how it works. Everybody buys Bitcoins in exchanges or third party like you want it to call it. Plus they provide a wallet, linked to your identity. 
Yes you can tell Overstock refund to your private address, but their process dictates they sent only to Coinbase wallet, so go and create one, end of story. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:28:20
Unless you planing on trading BCC right away, I would suggest to seat back and relax. Make sure you really own the key, and after the storm, decide what to do. Be aware during this storm there is a high chance of BTC price fluctuations, until people agree what coin to support. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:40:55
Transfers slowness are not the exchange fault, its the BTC network. Confirmations are miners validating the transfer. You will just have to wait until yours its picked up.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:37:34
Its not a website what you are looking for. Its an app called "blockfolio".
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:18:14
There are other exchanges like Gemini, where you can convert to Fiat, but you have to go thru their validation process to open an account, and takes days.
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:32:32
Maybe other exchanges has bigger trains, or less people, or maybe Coinbase is just fucking with you, because it hates you.
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:46:55
Here I google it for you:

My answer is based the following, (bullet 4), sorry if it does't comply or agreed with whats been discussed in earlier reddit post:
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:06:02
And their addresses to confirm too! You know
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:31:00
Then get a hardware wallet a soon as posible. Trezor or Nano Ledger. Its the best way to secure your investment. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:23:04
 Nope. Its not the exchange, its a global thing.
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:02:20
Believe what you want to believe, the transaction is on the network, no the exchanges. The confirmations are on the blockchain, you can search the wallet address where you are sending the balance, and it will show you. It is not rare to be a delay when there is a surge in demand. You are not the only one withdrawing to private wallets wanting BCC. Aug 1st is almost there. 
And by the way, the backlog they had in the ETH network not long ago was due to the ETH based ICOs clogging the Ethereum network, this is known to be fact. 
Coinbase is not the most perfect of the exchanges, but you have to be realistic of what is going on. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:47:42
I got a Trezor and love it. Trezor is more a mini computer, ledger is more of a chip. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:29:58
I would do that, at this point we don't know what token will get more support over the other. Just make sure you own the key, put it in a safe place. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:24:35
But be warned, you need to have your balance in electrum before the fork. If you leave it in the exchange you won't have any BCC, because the exchange owns the key, not you. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:06:31
Looks like a flash crash
