Yes i have tried LSD recently a couple days ago and holy fuck its nice dude. Way nicer. DXM is a dirty drug.

@_date: 2017-12-30 13:28:37
Yes. I personally think LSD is better. DXM makes u tweak and u cant really move much. Its weird ig

I made the account before july 25th 2017 (like 2016) before their new policy on no minors. I guess they forgot about my account...

I truly believe that BTC will grow about 50% in at least 3 months. Its just i have discussed this with my father (i would say he is a really wise man, that man know a lot about business, stocks, e.t.c) and he says that .... what i just said... 
i think that even if it drops eventually it will rise if you wait long enough.
And what do you mean you cant mine btc with a gpu?

My question is who proposed segWit2x and how did they choose it. Is there a special commity or a couple CEOs voted on it?
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:26:04
I would agree. Only if it wasnt the last of my money. Not saying i wont consider it because im already considering it. 
But isnt there a limit to BTC. Isnt it like 21 million or billion. What happens when it reaches the limit. If it ever does and doesnt crash. (Rn i think its around 10 mil or bil but im not sure. They say it will reach the limit in around 10 years. Maybe less)
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:34:13
Yes but why was there a spike when they announced that segWit2x is cancelled
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:23:43
In the last 15 min the price of btc is skyrocketing down. Its $174 less than what it was an hour ago and $400 less than the peak of this hour. Strange...
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:34:51
Im trying to invest the last of my money into this
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:34:35
But what about the other option. Investing into BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:31:24
Coinbase. Has the lowest fees ever. Really easy to use
