When you hit the buy button on coinbase it locks that price in at that moment...doesnt matter if price rises or falls..so once your funds go through in 5 to 7 days youll get the price that you locked into..

Yes when you hit buy it will lock in and you can then click accounts..youll see btc wallet.. it will say 0.000000 click the btc wallet and youll see your transaction pending and the amount of the sell price pending..click it again and it will show you the price you locked in it..hope this helps

I use cb but when i go to sell out im going to transfer to gdax since there are no fees..as of right now im only using cb..also ive been reading about the ledger nano s.. people are storing their crypto on the nano s instead of keep it in a online wallet which could possibly be hacked..

Seems to be even worse with older people..there is a retired cop who comes to my shop(to drink free coffee)and was making fun of us talking about bitcoin and litecoin saying it was fake money/ponzi..had to explain to him there are 2 sides of it.. the trading side of it and the actual use of a crypto..he couldn't grasp the fact of selling and buying on the exchange and making usd off it he thought it was just some weird fake coin that couldnt be sold for fiat...then blew his mind when i tried to explain its not like buying 1 share of a stock..you can buy a fraction of bitcoin..he downloaded the app by the time he left hahah!

Move your crypto to a ledger nano s....i think they are around 70 bucks now..

Buy when you can...if it goes to 25k this week then drops to 10k next month just buy again at 10k..only spend what you can afford is key...
