what are you some kind of brain genius

This reasoning you're implying is beyond idiotic

that's quite debatable 
the thing is, stock prices etc. do not follow laws of nature which are typically regular.

Nope. They banished me and made me cash out. And of course, the app was still throwing the error so I couldn't cash out and was basically facing a ticking clock until they stole my money. I had to call customer support and was on the phone with them for 40 minutes. It's a horrible company.

yesterday afternoon via email. I also wrote a 'note' to them on the site.

Did you ever get it resolved? I'm having the exact same issue right now.

yeah I should have done that initially. I doubt Circle would let me send it back. It seems like it's just not letting me send in general
