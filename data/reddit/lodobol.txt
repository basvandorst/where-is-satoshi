So many crypto traders have given me the same advice. They say that they would have more bitcoin today if they just bought and held. Their mistakes were not permanent losses in USD because the price went up so much but trading resulted in BTC losses. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:23:13
As noobs loose their coins to computer failures, lost thumb drives, and other issues, disappearing coins will make bitcoins more valuable.

It may drop but it’s not going to 0. I doubt it could go down 30%. People will just buy more in droves. Long term, the futures will help bitcoin. Big money will have a way to hedge large positions. That can only help bitcoin as more money can flow in.

It’s tough day trading. You almost have to go into some Alts with .2 BTC and just hope they outpace btc by 4-10x in a few months. Then you could get back to 1 btc.

Thanks for this explanation. It definitely added to my understanding of what I’ve been learning. 
Just to confirm: The private keys, only the owner could know, proves ownership of bitcoins on the bitcoin ledger. These are stored in the wallets (online or offline) and should be kept secret and safe.

I gave people advice about getting involved with stocks. I’d tell them, open an account a buy $1000 of stock in a company you already know. After that, you will pay attention and have the incentive to learn more about trading. Don’t sell what you bought for at least 3months. During that 3 months, think about the next stock you want and buy more stock. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:33:58
I think futures add legitimacy. More financial products will come online soon. This will allow larger amounts of money to flow into bitcoins because there will be products available to hedge positions. Short term, I have no idea. BTFD

That’s the challenge! Consider this, if crypto is hear to stay. Money flows into crypto. If bitcoin can hit at least $20,000 after 9 years, so can other coins. And with history and mass adoption as an accelerant, it could be faster for some coins. 
That said, owning 50 coins of any coins that hits $20,000 would give you $1,000,000 for that coin. So new coins with some potential, that are less than $0.01 seem like no brained to buy at least $0.50 worth. Heck, buy $10 worth and literally never sell till 20k. Others may cost more to get 50 but that could be a goal. 
With 50 coins in the most likely future coins, you have a great position to reach $1,000,000.

I’ve traded stocks since 2004 and if I bought shares over the years, never sold, never traded, I’d probably be a millionaire. But NOPE, extremely far from it. 
Taking that lesson, I don’t plan to try trading these volatile crypto markets. I’ll just try to build positions the hard way and it probably will pay off with more future currency. Especially seeing most of the advice on trading errors killing gains in btc.  
So far, when I wanted to sell, I dug deep on that experience and did nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:19:46
Wish I sold a few days ago. I’d buy now and be perfectly happy

People are not explaining it well to you. I will try. 
Trading can yield profits sure; hodling will too. The key is comparing the two and also considering time. 
While trading in a bull market it’s easy for trades to be profitable and you feel great. Buying low and selling high. But be sure to keep track of what you would make just holding. Usually over time you will fall behind even if you profit. 
Also consider the time staring at charts and doing technical analysis. If you spend 10-20 hours a week doing this outside of hours at work you could do something else to make more money and just buy more BTC. 
Ex. A second job, making YouTube vids about crypto, an Amazon business, cut grass, drive uber or lyft (which I do for extra crypto money). 
I learned this lesson from the stock market. I was smart and invested 25% of my salary since I started working. Half 401k and half after tax. 
So then I start trading. I’m making money. Then I start doing options. I loose until I figure out net credit spreads and I start making a lot of money. I had goals to make 500 to 1000 a week from the credit spreads. So I make 40k. I feel great but it was a lot of time and stress.
Then I look at my 401k money and I was buying shares of the same companies I did all that trading with. My 401k gains were WAY higher than all the trading I did. Because given enough time (7 years) companies like MSFT, GOOGL, NFLX, AMZN, MCD, NKE, etc. all had 5x to 10x runs. I could not have traded that successfully for all of 7 years. 
While I’m trading one stock I’m missing the gains of all the others. The same will apply to crypto. You will miss the big runs of many crypto’s they will be 10x while you try to trade. Also you will also have losses that will further cause you to lag hodling. 
I think the best method is to make yourself an index fund and decide to hodl until 10x or 0. If you buy something, BTC or an ALT, buy thinking you’re can never sell. So the criterion and trade size should reflect that. You may one day read a great ALT website and think, this sounds amazing! It’s the next big thing! I’m going to put 80% of my money in this! They all sound amazing and most are years from viable and adoption. The delay kills the price and most crypto trades on hype and emotion. 
Long term though, projects that have true value will be reflected in their coins price. You have to determine what will be the future value of this crypto in 10 years. It has to be 10 or more. 
So as you trade, realize, you are missing the big runs from hodling. Keep track of that because even as you win trades, you will look back in 10 years and realize, damn! If I just bought and held I would be a millionaire right now. But I traded and made just 100k.

I was just thinking corrupt politicians would find easy way to receive and spend payments. Imo, sadly, it would be just as easy with crypto as cash. 
With the various privacy coins, wash sites, private addresses. 
How would the FBI for example trace a transaction to a politician if they:
Received the original funds via monero to an address created on a ledger. Then they trade said funds through a quick swap site to a BTC address they also never used. And when they finally want to pay for something they either paying directly from that address or send to an exchange to get fiat. 
The origin of the funds would be completely obscured even if the final address was linked to them.

I still failed on several fronts.
