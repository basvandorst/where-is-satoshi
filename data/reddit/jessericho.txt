Absolutely not. I said it was for used car.
To this day, I’ve turned $5k to around $195k. Best decision I ever made.
Im pulling out soon though, shits getting way too risky.

Using bitcoin for MDMA... Ahhh the nostalgia of when I used to buy them off silkroad for 10 bitcoins each... fml

I would of loved to get into mining back in the day! Sounds like you really enjoyed it mate. Thanks for the advice, I don’t personally know anyone else who’s doing this, so I rely on this sub, YouTube and some other websites for info. But yeah, thinking of cashing out a couple coins before that thing on Sunday. 
Buy me a nice lawn chair, coupla beers, sit back and ride this thing out!

Yeah, nah cheers cunt. Feels fucking good to be honest. Gonna cash out a couple this weekend before it goes pop! Good luck if you’re in this too my man!

It would of sucked having to sell it for those things, but don’t be beat yourself up about it. You were one of the originals, I think that’s cool as shit!
If you stumbled across btc back then, I’m sure you’re going to be a couple steps ahead of the rest of the world when then next big things comes along. Keep your eyes and ears out mate, you’ll see.
Good luck!

Yeah nah I could afford it if it went bust. You sound like the Sheila at the bank telling me I could borrow more! Haha get fucked! $5k was the most I’d borrow on a ‘hunch’. Mate as long as she gets ya from A to B that’s all that matters! Wish I could get a $1500 car, I’m still ‘real life’ broke. Fuck me dead ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:42:30
Horrible idea. But thanks my man!
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:27:09
Mate, just do it. It’s a beautiful gesture of love.
“Grandma you’re such a silly cunt, love ya”
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:47:07
C’mon mate, lighten up. 
I did my research via tech sites and magazines after watching a Bitcoin doco on Netflix. Lol. 
I’m proud of the risk I took.  Don’t be salty.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:08:44
Touche’ 
Cheers mate!

Ahhh okay I see what you mean, well my ‘hunch’ was that it was gonna skyrocket the following weeks so had no time to save.
Jesus, yeah nah she sounds too thirsty/expensive for me man. At $6 a gallon down here, I’d rather a fucking bike.

I clearly stated not to do this in my initial post.
I’m not giving advice or helping anyone, if old Sarah wants to suck dick for bitcoin, good on ya love! Other people can do what ever they want I’m not responsible for their actions. 
I took a big fuck off risk and it paid off. Just wanted to share my luck with this sub! Be a little less negative and a little more Posivated!
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:38:21
Mate, I got called a fuckwit by every friend and family member I have. It wasn’t the wisest decision I’ve made, but definitely the smartest... in some way I guess lol.
I now have 4 BTC + 100 LTC + 10 ETH.
48 BTC in rent? No... fucking.. way..! Respect though mate, Jesus you’ve earned it!
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:15:42
Jesus, you sound like the most humble fucking person on this whole sub.  Good for you mate, I’m loving your enthusiasm! You got some reserves set up which is smart! Really hope this pays off for you mate. 
The moon can get fucked, lets ride this to Mars! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:21:30
Too fucking right! I’ll give you a Gold when we hit $50k
