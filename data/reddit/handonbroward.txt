Entry cost would be prohibitively high. The dispensaries here in CO have the most minimal of technological presences. The people who run the shops tend to be very business savvy, but not tech savvy. Especially here, you have to realize that many of these people have been doing it for a longgg time, now they are just doing it legally.  
  
They don't have a desire to change their ways of business, and least of all they don't want to try radical new ideas. The risk/cost association is too great, especially with how expensive the overhead is. It is disappointing to see how relatively tech-lagging the marijuana sector is. I am shocked to see how many dispensaries do not even have SMS services set up for their customers. The web design of most dispensary websites is atrocious. Eventually the tech sector will be a big part of the pot industry, but the adaptation is going to be very slow.

Yea exactly my thought. No quicker way to attract federal attention than to dabble in Bitcoin and legal pot. They would watch you like a hawk until they found some tiny discrepancy, then come and take everything away. Even if you were found to be in the right eventually, we all know how hard it is to get everything back once it is seized.

Late response, they would seize all of your other assets and your BTC wallet. What I meant is we know how hard it is to get grow equipment or anything pot related back, even if you win your case.
