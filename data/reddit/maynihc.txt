I don't think you or we or anyone is 'letting' them do this. They can do what they want without your permission

Nothing really. That's why you should send it to a wallet you control as soon as possible.

Income tax in the highest bracket is 30 percent. The first 1.5 lacs (2250 usd) are tax free. Then there are slabs for 10 and 20 percent. 
I think sales tax is around 14 percent. 
The current situation is that all salaried employees have tax deducted at source. Small businesses under report their income and bribe IT inspectors to turn a blind eye. Builders etc too usually pay a tiny fraction of the tax they owe. Restaurants do not enter all sales into the books (or have separate books for their own accounting and reporting purposes). 
It's not that the tax is too high, it's more that people avoid paying because they can. There is considerable resentment among the salaried middle class that rich businessmen get away without paying taxes while they can't.  
Unfortunately there isn't much awareness about Bitcoin right now. Digital payment systems like Paytm are reaping a lot of benefit from the cash shortage. Even the move to Paytm and other 'online wallets' was slow, but somewhat forced because of the circumstances.

I'm sorry I should have been more elaborate. 
If Blockchain is somehow compromised the client side code could be modified to steal your key. Sure it's client side, but how many users verify the js? 
It's not as bad as a bank - like wallet where you could just have your account 'blocked', but you're still relying on a third party more than you have to.
