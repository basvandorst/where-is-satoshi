You know it might be better to petition Coinbase to create the machine rather than Coinstar. If only because Coinbase is already in the business of converting USD to BTC. Granted Coinbase is a new business and this business model appears to be outside the scope of their activities. I think Coinbase is more apt to pull it off. The thing Coinstar has going for this idea is that they already have a foot hold in these stores that the machines would reside in.

Let me review the petition again and I will make critiques and get back to you. 
Edit: PMed you some critiques/rewirte of the wording of the petition.

I have no doubt you came up with the idea on your own. I think it's great that you took it one step further. More power to you and if I can help in anyway let me know. Good on you for trying to make a good idea come true.

I believe this site is a scam. DO NOT BUY from them. I contacted the owner through the site because I was skeptical about purchasing anything from them. Replies were immediate prior to making the actual purchase. After making the purchase and sending payment communication stopped. I highly advise not buying from them. Lost .1 BTC to this scam. PM me for details on my communications involving this SCAM! I am going to contact the website host to notify them.
