tech companies hire new grads, so it doesn’t take years

The word “fault” implies it’s a problem. I’m not asserting that it is a problem, I just think it’s a conversation worth having.  The source of the gender imbalance isn’t immediately obvious and I think it’s prudent to make sure that this doesn’t indicate some level of discrimination or insularity in the bitcoin community.
I don’t think I’m particularly qualified to speak on these things, I’m just surprised at how dismissive some people can be when this subject is raised, which makes me more eager to raise it.

I think the insulting thing is to say that there is no barrier to entry for women in stem and then try to make up reasons why there aren’t women in stem. Reasons like “they don’t like it as much”.
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:46:46
Maybe I’m not being clear. If there are any hopes of bitcoin being a commonly used currency, women need to be involved.
@_date: 2018-03-17 04:26:43
The part where the “currency of the world” isn’t used by women.

Well normally it would be alarming to investor to have a massive slice of society totally uninterested in the thing they invest in.

That’s not true, it’s very much an issue. Girls aren’t encouraged to enter stem fields the same way boys are. If it actually weren’t an issue, what gives the with gender disparity? Coincidence?
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:53:54
Because stem is an increasingly important, well paid, intellectually rigorous set of disciplines that requires education and hard work to succeed in and if you believe that women are just as intellectually capable as men then there is no reason why they shouldn’t be equally represented. 
Also, no one is actively encouraged into trash collection or janitorial duties.

Check out coin.dance/stats/gender for stats on community engagement. 
Regardless, what if the number were 70%? Still a pretty heavy lean, no?

Then to go back to my original point: if there is nothing stopping anyone from getting into coding why is the ratio of men to women in coding not 50:50? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:56:45
It is a gender, it’s male. &gt;95% of bitcoin is owned by men. Is that inherently bad? Not necessarily. But, we can’t pretend that gender has no role in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:56:25
I understand that you don’t care but I don’t understand why.
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:25:59
Then it would be even more alarming.
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:08:56
Not trying to force an equal ratio. Trying to ask why the ratio is what it is.  I don’t know why you aren’t curious about that. How are you so sure that all barriers to entry have been removed? Evidence points to the contrary.

To the technology, yes but not to the culture and community surrounding bitcoin which in turn affects its value. 
I think questions of gender imbalance are interesting and relevant as they pertain to bitcoin. The vast majority of those involved in bitcoin are men. The answer to why that is is not immediately obvious. There is nothing inherently masculine about bitcoin. Forget identity politics, it is an an undeniably curious phenomenon worth exploring.
