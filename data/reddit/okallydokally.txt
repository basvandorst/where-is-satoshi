Right, that's why they would want to sell.

Hey Debbie Downer.  Everyone understands the value of money.  Just chill and be happy for the guy for second!

I agree it's human nature.  Everything that we do is human nature.  But we do a lot of sh*ty, morally reprehensible things.

The only thing more embarrassing than people complaining, fear mongering, and crying is that you subsequently endorse Bitcoin in the same post.  Either be comfortable with people endorsing or hating on Bitcoin and feel free to chime in...or take a stance against it and just shut the hell up altogether.  
In reality you are an overly-sensitive Bitcoin owner and simply want people to say good things, not bad.  You want the price to go up.  Others want it to go down.  Deal with it.

You sound like a young Wall Street guy desperately trying to sound relevant.  Let me address your poor logic bullet by bullet
- But $1200 for shiny pretty Gold makes sense?
- every fiat started somewhere
- of course the market is illiquid, it's in it's early stages and people are unsure.  Current illiquidity is irrelevant to it's future potential.
- do you get paid in Gold?  You understand that Bitcoin can be broken into BitChange right?  So your .00001% logic makes no sense.  Everyone could have BitChange.
- People sell gold to buy dollars so they can shop with dollars
-"parabolic chart..." ...now your just pretending to sound like you know what you are talking about.
- anybody who knows anything knows that bitcoin isn't anonymous
- cumbersome?  How so?  Have you tried it?  A 6 year old could use it.
- consumer protection.  agree with you hear. it must be addressed.
- environmental waste...cmon dude. more waste goes into making pennies.

Didn't mean it so literally.  Reddit claims to be a bastion of free speech.  The whole culture is supposed to be based on this.  Unless of course it negatively affects the wealth of a small minority of powerful (within reddit) individuals.
