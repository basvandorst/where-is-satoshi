By 2040 scarcity-based economy won't exist.

This was obvious throughout the bitcoin lifetime.

Can someone please please shop this guy into the middle of that youtube video of bitcoin exchange rate going through music synthesizer? Right prior to the crash obv :)

The honest answer is "I don't know". I think you are overlooking the reasons why people invest into gold. Gold is not just a commodity, it's an industrial resource, being used in almost every single high-tech manufacturing chain. When I invest into gold, I invest into that intrinsic value and industrial demand for it, knowing that it will only increase. No amount of bitcoin will ever make up for that need for gold. The only market overlap bitcoin **may** have with gold is the people that invest into gold "just because" or any fad followers/jumpers. If it's these 5% that leave gold market and jump into Bitcoin, that will only mean more stability for gold market in the long run, but I personally don't think that these 5% will be a healthy market for Bitcoin. In fact, this very thing has been a major turn off for me as a potential Bitcoin investor.

Well, you've made an argument against US dollar using current president, we're almost a year into his presidency now and the apocalypse still hasn't happened, consumer confidence is at an all time high, so I'm not sure how that argument is valid in any way. Nikita Khrushchev was barely literate, so I'd say you still have it good.

Yes. It can also change about Bitcoin, and that's the only thing propping Bitcoin. One other USD side however, US government has access to multiple ways of manipulating consumer confidence.

If anyone tells you that something is unhackable, they are lying to you. I work in IT security. Nothing is unhackable. Those hardware wallets sure do look fancy and confidence inspiring though. 


So, what are those? You haven't listed any. I apologize if I have overlooked them somewhere, but could you list them again?
Edit: Re your edit: 


Uh, I fail to see how that is. The only qualifier for money is the ability to exchange it for goods and services, and bitcoin fails at that. If I went to my local grocery store, I can't pay with bitcoin. Movies? Nope. Get gas for my car? Nope. Internet outage? Can't pay for a pizza. You need a hardware wallet to prevent theft, which then ties you down to a computer. It's a bulky unwieldy thing that relies on a huge complex infrastructure of both electricity and internet. So please try again to prove your point.


I'm going to merge our other thread into here if that's okay with you. 
To answer your question: money is the best at being money. Gold has stopped being money a long time ago. Money is already a concept. It used to be paper notes, but not anymore. now you just have "Dollars", "Yen", "Rubles", or whathaveyou on your bank account, but strictly speaking that doesn't mean anything, because it's literally a record in a database with a currency type attached to it. Bitcoin is like trying to re-invent the bicycle. Like I've told someone, the only revolutionary paradigm of bitcoin is that government doesn't have to be the emitter of currency (But Americans have known that for a long time).

If you're going to compare bitcoin to gold, why don't you also list the cons?
1. You are 1 hack away from being completely broke and never seeing your money ever again. With gold, even if you are robbed, it's much easier to catch a criminal, and you can make it extremely hard to steal. You can actually have insurance against robbery and have them reimburse your losses. 
2. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Gold is used in hundreds of industries and has intrinsic value due to that. 
3. Your purchasing power is extremely limited with bitcoin. It is growing, but is still quite small. With gold you are one pawn shop away from having whatever fiat currency is currently in favor. 
I am not arguing in favor of fiat currencies. I'm just saying that Bitcoin is another fiat currency that has no intrinsic value. If all gold disappeared tomorrow, our technological civilization will crush in a blink of an eye. If Bitcoin disappears, the world moves on.

While I totally agree with every word you say, I don't see how you could make an argument against this semi-tested theory in favor of any completely untested theory where bitcoin is the major currency in the world.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:11:42
I keep telling this to people, but it's like beating your head against a brick wall.

Yet consumer confidence is at an all time high. Also, the Fed is its own thing (not a government agency) and has its own strings to pull. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:52:38
That's not relevant. Bitcoin will never have the same level of backing. And benevolence of a global consumer market is a fickle thing. I wouldn't entrust my old socks to it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:27:45
See, the difference is that MS and Apple were able to lock in the market. Bitcoin is too decentralized. Bitcoin changes the whole paradigm of who is actually the emitter of currency. And in this case it's neither government nor Chinese data centers (that are currently controlling +50% of Bitcoin emission).
Edit: I'm not saying it's not revolutionary, it is. It's just the next logical thought is: "why should I rely on some Joe Blow to tell me how much my work costs? I'll emit my own currency: pfcfita's." What was ridiculous 10 years ago, can easily happen today.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:18:23
I understand the technology. It thrives on decentralization. But I am thinking forward in terms of competition. If it is to become a currency and to compete with other currencies its control will have to be consolidated. Otherwise it will simply fail or stay a "commodity" as they call it atm. 


Yeah, and it works terrible. We end up relying on the "power of the market" which is in essence a bunch people who could not get a job other than a stock broker or who think that a stock broker job is a great career. Look what it did to US and the rest of the world in 2008. 


It's a feature of the idea. Bitcoin as a physical entity does not benefit from said feature in any way shape or form. 
Like I've said before, I think the idea is great, amazing, ground breaking. It's basically bloodless digital Communism. The physical implementation as seen in Bitcoin is weak insofar as it lacks coordination controls and will not be able to stay competitive with other currencies. The bitcoin popularity is a fad, a bubble that will come to burst or just slowly deflate.
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:00:45
Oh, I don't question that it has been the driver. But "effective" and "good" are not necessarily qualities that go together. A slave-based economy is also quite feasible and very effective, just look at the pyramids and find out what a modern engineer would quote you on one and on how long it would take. Said market, coupled with inflation is in effect just that - economic slavery. You are **meant** to permanently be in debt throughout your life.
This:  is exactly what I meant by "weak due to lack of central control" and by market being terrible. You get clueless people with a lot of wealth/power. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:12:49
It's not a scam, it's a bubble. Everything bubbles. Dot com in the nineties, housing in 2008. Now bitcoin. No difference.
