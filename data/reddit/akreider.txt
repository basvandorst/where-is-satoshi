If they settle BTC positions at 604 and there are more longs than shorts -- however they cannot market sell or buy them (as trading was closed), so this  creates a loss which has to be absorbed by Bitfinex (eg. the difference between the current market price of 571 and 604).  Am I correct in this reasoning?
If so, why would they do this?  Why not use the market price from the point of time when trading restarts, or at the point where bankruptcy is declared and they announce that all future trading is canceled?
If I'm right, then they are bailing out the users who have BTC long positions (and might be using my money - as a USD lender, to do so). I think it is equally safe to assume that they would have held their positions or increased them in the face of losses (and that some people would have closed them in the low 500s or upper 400s and lost even more if the trading had stayed open).
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:28:46
It is likely to end up in either bankruptcy or a significant haircut. How can they legally justify bailing out people with long positions using other people's money?  I guess if we're lucky the market price will return to 600 and we won't worry too much about this. But it could be a very large factor if the market price goes down.

I think BFX has less BTC.  Maybe 200k-500k. For instance MtGox which had more volume (and the ecosystem was more concentrated) had only around 800k BTC.

I'm confused by the Bitgo wallet situation. I have a Bitgo wallet, but when I login to Bitgo it says it has never been used.  I have a small sized BTC balance that is in the Bitfinex "deposit" wallet and is not lent out.
So do I have another bitgo wallet that I don't know about?

So I was slightly older than average (early-mid 30s), have a BA in Economics, and knew that around 95% of the people offering high returns were either intentional scams or terrible business ideas that turned into scams. 
 The people who made the highest returns were investors that held or had long positions for most of 2013.  But I thought that was too risky, so I had a small long position and I lent money to speculators instead (and made over 100% APR at Bitfinex, but only with small amounts of money because I didn't want to lose it all).
Your theory about accidental scammers might be right, but it is too easy of an excuse for a lot of smart people who should have known better.  Pirate had accomplices (like all the pass- throughs) and they deserve to go to jail (well as much as anyone does - I actually oppose jails).

Now someone needs to create a corporation that will try to win this bounty and offer shares in it.  And of course BFX should trade the shares, ahem I mean tokens.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:06:09
If they settle at 604, but don't actually liquidate their assets - they aren't really settling anything.  It's like they are giving a preferential partial liquidation to a class of asset holders that legally doesn't have the right to preferential liquidation.
They are also using their own corporate assets to provide a subsidy for a class of users when they know that they are facing an overwhelming loss.  This is preferential treatment which I think is legally unwarranted. 
Unless I'm mistaken, the settlement was a paper settlement. They didn't sell or buy any cryptocurrencies which is what they would need to do to resolve the positions.
And if any BFX employees have BTC long positions that would make this paper settlement even worse.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:24:17

Right. But they are corporate assets (unless they have been distributed). And you have to follow relevant laws when you are prioritizing creditors.  And handing out free money to people, doesn't seem like a good idea when you are bankrupt.  Might even be a prosecutable offense, especially if any BFX staff happen to have long positions.

I've reported something similar to BFX support at least twice before (last time a couple months ago).  The margin lending is a bit buggy.

I'm guessing the people with long positions will see this as fair, and those with USD swaps as unfair.  So maybe we need some unbiased opinions =)
Also - would it matter if we could show that at least one BFX employee had a long position and benefited from this treatment?  (I don't have any proof. I just know that one or more employees have a history of trading using the exchange.)

Is volume really up 200% since May 2015? On the 1 week chart it looks roughly about the same since then.  I guess what really matters is their market share of the volume.  As absolute volume depends on market variance.
I wish they had a 1 million BTC as well, but I fear it is much less.
@_date: 2016-08-22 21:27:23
So they valued Kraken at $20 million ($100k for 0.5% of the equity)
Over the last 30 days, Kraken has 152,000 volume (BTC to Euro) and Bitfinex has 271,000 (BTC to USD).  Does anyone know the volume for each exchange over the past year/
So with this reasoning Bitfinex might be worth around $35 million (and the tokens around 49 cents).

I think the most critical part is that there is no evidence of anyone borrowing money from Trendon Shavers at his claimed rate of 10.4%/week.

May 2015 is low. But Jan - Mar 2015 were much higher.  Of course that was during the spike down to 175.  If you look at periods of low volatility, May 2015 is around the same volume as early May 2016.

I'm guessing that a single person or entity/fund has provided $3-$10 million in margin trading.  I say this based on the fact that I've seen a wall as high as $3.5 million at a rate that was above the FRR.  Also, several months ago when demand for swap was high - the supply of new swap was increasing by as much as $3 million/day (but then it stopped when the demand fell).  It looks like they found a swap provider with unlimited funds who was providing them without trying to drive the FRR rate down - so they were keeping the rate under 0.1%/day (with the exception of the occasional spike).  As such, I'm hopeful that they will take action on behalf of the swap lenders.  I have no idea who this person/entity is.
By contrast, I'm a minor player with around $30k.  Though $30k is enough for me to live on for 3-4 years, so I'd rather not lose it.

If they stalled for a year or two using a liquidator, this could solve itself out if BTC rises enough.

There is a good chance we'll get back 20% in the MtGox liquidation (and we already got back 45% from the Bitcoinica 's first liquidation). Which means that you could end up better off in terms of USD (and think about it -- it is fairly unlikely you would have held the 5000 BTC when the price went from $10 to $1000).
@_date: 2015-12-25 06:47:25

If true, they can probably get people to lend out at 2% APR - as per the typically extremely low rates on Bitfinex.  If they offer a greater rate, they'll get people (maybe me) transferring to Coinbase.
Note this is probably for shorting. So they can close the position before the trader loses more than their margin, and if done correctly there shouldn't be any risk to the lender.  (Risk can come from the market crashing extremely fast and a lack of liquidity, from hacking, inside scams, or from the exchange being offline during a crash.)

How on earth would you save 15%?   It looks like they expect the bitcoin buyers to subsidize the purchase to the tune of 10-25%, by paying above market prices.  A couple people might do that.  But I'm guessing the premium would decline to 1-3% as more people use it.
On second thought, it looks like they are targeting small bitcoin purchase amounts.  So that might work, but I don't think there is much money in it for purse.io.

I've also filed a series of bugs. They are currently ignoring my request to right align the numbers (ex. for swap amounts), and to stop switching back to USD as the default view (ex. when you switch from trade to exchange).  And I've filed a couple small bugs that they did fix.  No reward though.

But miners only get 10% of their revenue from fees (assuming I read the charts right) and 90% from the block reward. They stand to earn a lot more money if the BTC price increases.  At least for the next 2-3 reward halvings.  It doesn't make sense to fight for greater fees when that can easily cause the BTC price to fall 10-30% in the short-term and a lot more in the long term (or more accurately you will see the BTC price increase at a slower rate than it would otherwise do so).

Got to add 2011.  Roughly a $31 to $2 correction.
Also you need to admit that these corrections varied significantly by exchange.  At the high and low there is generally a greater difference in the prices at each exchange.  As a starting point, one could round to the nearest $1 for any price &gt; $100 and nearest $10 for any price &gt; $1000 and so on.  You don't want to over-emphasize  the level of accuracy of the numbers.
Historically there is also the tendancy to flash crash down to $0-$1 or $100 (2013).  So you have to distinguish between them and market prices (for instance excluding any time where one exchange goes 20% below the others).

One scenario.  Tether starts off with a full USD backing. Then Bitfinex starts having banking trouble. So they back some of Tether with their equity.  This happens at the same time as the 2017 bubble, so they have increasing amounts of equity to use as the value of Bitfinex is growing exponentially.  Perhaps unintentionally they end up in an out of control bubble that they are backing in a manner that could easily collapse.
But then why did it collapse?
And why did the collapse stabilize and rebound?  Normally Bitfinex's equity should have fallen so much that they couldn't back Tether and it would have collapsed.  Unless they managed to sell bitcoins at the top - which is a very hard thing to do unless you know you are going to trigger the crash.  Alternatively, the bubble might have created so much publicity and activity (new corporations) that it created its own value.   And the story of Willybot is largely lost on most people who think that Bitcoin's value came from real growth.
Some interesting comparisons with MtGox Willybot.  The MtGox withdrawal issues were far more severe and resulted in a 10% price premium (as people bought BTC to withdraw).  Bitfinex is far more professional than MtGox, though they try to avoid regulation and have some questionable views.  For instance Nicole Ralph voicing support for the ponzi Bitcoin Savings and Trust on bitcointalk.org, the creation of a short term bitcoin mining contract called TH1 that was manipulated so the price increased while the mining value decreased, the creation of an IOU token when they were hacked, the creation of the USD LEO token without following US securities law, etc.

In BTC terms, volume is fairly flat since mid 2017.
So volume would be up in USD, but so would it in the rest of the world...

Mining is like margin trading. You do very well if the price goes up (and very badly if it goes down).  Probably a lot of large miners use hedging to limit this.

If the rates are this high, it is very suspicious. Be very suspicious of any investment that offers &gt; 10% APR (so 10% in a month is off the charts suspicious).
There is a small chance that you can be do very well in mining if the BTC price rises faster than people are able to create new miners (and faster than expected).

Technological improvements that increase mining efficiency actually make it easier for a new player to take down the bitcoin network.

It is treated much like a stock split.  The basis in the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold would be allocated between the two pieces and when either of the Bitcoin investments are sold or exchanged, a gain or loss on the transaction would be reported on PA Schedule D based upon the new allocated basis.

The key point here is that a lot of wealth is backed by debt and not counted.  So the actual percentage for crypto-currency of all wealth is lower.
Similarly you could say that the equivalent of 100% of the "net wealth" of the poorest 20-50% of the world is held in crypto-currency. Why? Because their net wealth is about zero.

It won't always rise. We're eventually going to have a bear market like the end of 2013-2015, BTC price may fall 80%, and then what do you do?  Especially if you are always investing your profit into building a larger operation.
