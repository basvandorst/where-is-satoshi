where those coins that "the contract will be buying for less than market price" are? Where they come from? Do I have to pay upfront when I made the contract or can can I choose to pay when the date is due?

We don't really have IRS or similar here, but the exchanges don't use our currency so we end up paying some transaction fees (and some taxes here and there on some services) while money enters or leaves your bank account. So its kind of a pay-off. Talking to an accountant, that's pretty much &gt;enough&lt;, and just as someone else mentioned, if more than 1 year holding you don't even need to care to update anymore.

It made sense now. Thanks! Great link also.

That's my plan. I'm very sure the dude can literally stop all this shittalk by showing his wallet balance for a second. He earns almost triple what these guys get on his regular paycheck, and I would guess he's investing since he started. I do know that 8K is still late adopting, but as you guys always say "yesterday was the best moment, and that moment is now today".
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:23:50
Pretty much. And he does pay "taxes" as he was trying to explain before, but nobody gave a single shit so far.

I would seriously love stats about my life. I get all happy looking at Sniper Elite's numbers, or even Borderlands, and some more specific games with a giant damn list (like world of warcraft's stats, there's even Different beverages consumed)
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:31:19
I never realized how much time one can spend on that... If we had stats like Steam's "Time Played" life would be way different.

Guys we have work to do.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:09:03
Makes sense but doesn't explain how the hell does that work.

Be ready to, quoting "whip ... crypto dick around in 5 years."

Great advice. +1

this is something i never knew i wanted to read.

Yes, but I would prefer to invest during the dip and then watch as my life crumbles or explodes.

Welcome friend.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:49:32
Where to sell fast on high and where to buy fast during dips? Coinbase isn't available in my country and LocalBitcoin rates are over the top + the fact that they already charge 11k per bitcoin

I don't plan on paying the entire loan out of the profit, just pay enough that I can finish the loan and have some extras. Then maybe repeat. I can afford it, but that can also screw my well being financially, if it goes totally south. As previously stated, all I had was $50 when it was 8k. I have a little over $60(0.004) now.

Said by someone last year.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:36:38
Thanks for the elaborated answer.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:43:59
I didn't start with much and only have 0.004 - Even considering "bitcoin 20k tomorrow" it won't be much. I just want to be able to invest something monthly, a little more than I could without the loan, you know? If it goes bad, I would be able to pay the loan, but if it works out I can get some good profits.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:46:27
Yeah. It's not for the profit, but that is a very very nice part of it. I don't plan on getting on that train this soon. I intend to use it but also replace with the same ammount in cash that I used the btc for.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:31:43
And fuck brazil.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:37:46
I'm not familiar with what that means, but, "better odds" is my reason to think of this gamble.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:46:37
Maxing out those 300$ next month and getting (probably) 5% back would be good. And repeat. And repeat. And get another card. And repeat. Might work, lol.  Here hoping my GF won't leave me.
(She panicked when I bought the 0.004 and is just now realizing that I got SOME profit.)
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:42:37
I only have 1 credit card and probably won't be able to use it until next 12/05. But anyways, 300$ is not a big limit to "max".
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:15:37
All I had was $50 when it was 8k. I have a little over $60 now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:53:04
One quick question, now: Where did you get btc with credit cards? '-'
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:45:55
I see.
People have also won on the black, so maybe I could try.
