They're making their debut at several banks this year. It was in the papers a few weeks ago. (Sorry, too lazy to find link)
There's another company entering the game too, branded under J-debit.

Japan no longer has high savings rates, at least not among young people. Older people have generally kept their money in postal savings accounts or bought national bonds -- they are highly risk averse.
Of course payment technologies will catch up, but why is anyone talking about them leapfrogging every other country? 
Although electronic transfers have been the norm here for ages, the only recent change to payment systems has been the growth of e-money stored on public transit rfid cards. Prepaid credit cards made their proper debut in the second half of last year as well, but I'm not sure how they've caught on.

wait, how is bitcoin any more cash-like than a debit card?
edit: incidentally, debit cards are only seeing wide introduction this year -- and they won't be useful in places like supermarkets and convenience stores for years to come, more than likely.

There's really no reason to think that bitcoin will be the decentralized currency of the future.

and on preventing money laundering, and on funding of criminal organizations, and on hiding taxable assets!
Hooray.
