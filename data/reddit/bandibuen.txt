Looks like everything is set for the upcoming bull run. Not so long for that inevitable new all time high.

Around $0.01 - $0.20 usually.

Well what else is more satisfying than seeing shorts getting rekt ;D

Look how strong the support is right now. In 30 minutes chart, after a quick 70 dollar dump, it ended up being a green candle within the same 30 minute candle.

Stop-Limit Buy order
1. Stop price: $6,600
2. Limit price: Whatever the price you wanna buy at
3. It won't get executed at $6,600. Your order will start getting filled starting $6,600.01 until it's filled up. Your average buy price will be higher than $6,600. However, $1,000 is not really a significant amount that can affect the price that much. Therefore, your order will be filled at $6600.01 if you set stop loss at $6,600.

If you look at the chart BTC/USDT (Binance), it has made 3 tops in the main bull run being 19,798.68 and after that it got a massive correction it again got pumped up to 11,786.01 and  after another correction back to the same level of 6,000, it got another pump up to 10,020USDT. Then it again dropped back to around 5,750 and pumped up to 8491.77 which again got dumped back to 5,700USDT. As you can see, according to this pattern, after every time it tested 6,000 support throughout the year, it made a bounce back but only to meet a lower high than the previous one. Therefore, in order to confirm that we are in a bull run, I believe Bitcoin should break 8,500USDT and that would definitely give a clear indicator of a bull run which would indeed lead to a new ATH.

BTC/USDT volume on binance is now under 100 million USDT. It keeps going down.

You mean "Support".

Shares are backed by the net assets of the company. 
Iphone is a physical product. 
Neither of these work as currencies. Their value is determined by market demand and supply. 
USDT has no value. It's not backed by government nor is it issued by government. Only value USDT has is from the fact that it being backed by fiat USD. USDT will equal to USD1 as long as an actual $1USD fiat is available to back it. If they are using this backed money to invest in a bank, 
1. Someone purchases bitcoin or other cryptocurrency with the USDT that claims to have backed by fiat $1USD. 
2. Tether invest the Fiat USD in bank which is again circulated in the economy by operations of bank. 
So basically, the same $1USD is circulated in the crypto market and in the banking system. This is extremely chaotic. In my opinion, tether should have the equivalent amount of fiat money stored in an inaccessible vault. If any fiat to be withdrawn from such vault, the same amount of tether should be burnt. Otherwise tether should cease to exist and all exchanges should implement Fiat deposits and withdrawals with compliance to KYC.

I still have a big doubt about the tether. Now according to tether, these 2.5 Billion USD are in a bank account. Which means bank is using these cash for their business operations such as lending. And from the other side, people are using tether to buy cryptocurrency. So basically the same 1 USD has been used twice in fiat form and in crypto form. Tether should have the USD not in a bank but in a safe. Tether cannot invest this money not in a bank account not in anywhere. It should be in a safe where no one can access it as it's already being circulated as tether.

Tether is not a product though. It's just a coin created by a company to be used as the USD to buy cryptocurrency. If the actual USD fiat that backs tether is used for investing in another source, then tether is not really backed by it. Tether simply becomes fake money.

You can use brain. It's a simple calculation.

People said that level was boring though :D 
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:18:34
It's not a small drop though. Entire pump to 6600 from 6490 on binance was dumped. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:55:39
All time low is zero. If Bitcoin hits that, that means it's dead :D . It won't go to even $1000 levels unless something so catastrophic happens. But agree with this guys point. Weiners and whiners are always there despite it's on a bull run or a big dump.

I think it's not because you like bitcoin but because you spend entire day depressed in front of BTC/USD chart spending no time with family.

Rest in Pieces BCH. You had a great run of 15 months.

People were bored of 6500. They wanted an explosion.  
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:24:45
They don't. When the price pumps hard in one major exchange, it happens on others as well until there is no arbitrage opportunity.

Yeah dude transaction fee is like 20 cents.
