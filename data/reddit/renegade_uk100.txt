Check out r/Funfairtech 
Release date is 6th Feb, and still hugely undervalued. Will make huge leaps in 2018.

If bitcoin was ruined forever, there’d be earthquakes, volcanoes, the dead rising from the grave, Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!!!!

Why? I have a £500k house in a phenomenal area, great things for the kids to do, great primary schools, great facilities.....just a shite high school. Haha
If cryptos make me a millionaire, then private school for the girls or easy! :)

Brilliant, thanks a lot.

Fully agree! Everyone’s “moon” is at a different place!
For me, at 43 yrs old, I am hopefully going to pay off my Mortgage in 2018, using my portfolio of LTC/ETHE and FUN. If FUN takes off, and changed the crypto gambling scene, then I could even by a millionaire. 
If that happens, then it’s a life changing qty. I’d consider selling 80% of my portfolio, being mortgage free I could send my 2 girls to private school, and retire by 55 from my normal 9-5 semiconductor job! 
That’s my moon! ����

Ah ok, thanks. 
The whole tax issue is a minefield.

FUN coin is going to revolutionise the online gambling game, with crypto. It’s not a casino, but the tech to set up your own casino making it easy and transparent using blockchain.
It’s currently trading at $0.05 with a company announcement due on wed ahead of a Q1 2018 release. 
I’m expecting it to rise close to $1 sometime next year as it’s widely adopted.
The team behind it is immense and vastly experienced in online gambling. 
The current value is hugely underrated.

Took 2mths. Bought in FUN when it was $0.015, and also LTC at $40. I’ll totally admit, I’m a newbie to Crypto, only getting started in Sept.
But I now have a good stack of FUN, holding for improvemtents expected in Q1 and 2018, holding more LTC, &amp; ETH. 
To be honest, it is just pure luck, and I’m happy I got my initial investment back, so now can’t lose! 
If what I’m holding increases by x5 or more in 2018, I’ll cash in half again and hold the balance.

well done sir!! Everyone has their sell point where the on paper crypto value, becomes too high not to sell.  
being able to buy your own house, is brilliant. Well done to you and your family. 
I too have my sell point, where it'll be too good to Hodl, or not worth the risk. I hope to reach it too and be able to cash out and be a happy man! :)

I fully believe you did the right thing. The problem with BTC's and crypto's, is that no-one really knows whats round the corner. 
You cannot be greedy or you'll lose. We all have that figure in our heads that we "want".  
I've already cashed out my initial investment, and I am now working on pure profit. I'm new to BTC/crypto's and so, I know in my head the life changing figure, if my portfolio reaches it, then I'm out at.  
I dont want to be greedy and risk losing it all.

Couple of Questions though on what to report.
1). Say you bought BTC at £5, then sold for £10k. You said you declare the £5k profit. But what if there are fees to ship to coinbase and fees to withdraw to your bank, so you may only get £9.5k back. Would you only declare £4.5k for tax purposes?
2). Say you don’t have much disposable income, and you took a risk to invest in Cryptos. You invested £2k total, bought BTC for x and it increased to Y by the time you moved it to a market. You then used all of Y to buy an alt, say Ripple, and now your hodling. So in theory you haven’t sold, but still increased your stock value. What do you report there? 
Also, if you have not sold at all, why should you report anything, as you may not have it to pay until you sell and withdraw fiat.

Not where I live!  The local state schools have bad teachers!  Great area to raise kids and lovely place to live, just poor high schools.

The way I see it, is that you need to have a price you'll be happy with. You cant 2nd guess all your life. 
if your portfolio hits a high enough value, which you are tempted to sell at, then go for it.  It could crash the next day or rise. 
But you need to be happy with yourself and your decision. 
I know my figure, and will easily sell 80/90% of my crypto's if it hits it.  I'd keep a small qty in just incase it keeps going up and up..... ;)

"could" buy the house outright. but he "could" also lose all profit completely. 
everyone has a price that'll be too tempting to not sell at, otherwise, we'll all just be millionaires on paper, if we never sell ;)

we invested in Bitcoin and with all these coins for those who got in early, we have more money than sense!!

5 weeks really is like a couple of minutes in the crypto world.
In the past 12 weeks there has been dips, dips and mor dips. You need to look at the market before investing.
What did you expect to happen in 5 weeks? Did you do any research before investing? 
One of the major rules you should always abide by is “don’t invest what you cannot afford to lose”! Also, remember that it’s not a loss unless you sell at a lower value. Hold and wait for the market to recover, as it has done after every serious crash for the past 5-6 yrs.
Good luck with your next venture into crypto.

tide will come back in though, so could be well placed for an upturn.
