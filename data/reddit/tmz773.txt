Best comment I've seen in a long time.

I haven't seen it. There's plenty of videos in the early days of him discussing how we will bank the unbanked and under banked. Someone please show me I'm wrong.

This would require a hard fork correct?

I have no idea, but isn't there some middle ground here in the short to medium term instead of putting all our faith in something not created? I truly hope that we can solve the scaling solution, but incremental scaling seems like a logical solution. Isn't throwing a non scale able hard cap of block size a strange solution to this problem? Will all short term/medium term solutions cripple the future of bitcoin permanently? I'm genuinely asking.

Is our vision of banking the unbanked still there? These very high fees and off chain solutions seem to be far from what we all signed up for. I realize there are challenges with scaling adoption, especially this quickly, but it's starting to look like we may have lost our way...

Is it fair to assume that any increase in blocks I've would just be filled eventually and never fix the problem? Even short term. 
I'm thinking it's similar to the never ending increase in highways and highway lanes that caused LA to become the bloated spread out traffic monster that it now is.

At the moment it's value per coin is pretty awful. As soon as there's anything else comparable or actually an etf it will have to come down.

Yes, I just did.

Really cool, but I'm confused as to how were you able to sign up for a wallet and acquire bitcoins without a residency. I know someone posted about having that difficulty on here before...
