Haven't used Bitpay or Gdax, but is there a reason OP can't just send the balance in Coinbase straight to Bitpay (which it seems that's what they're using as wallet)? I've had no issues sending BTC from Coinbase directly. Is there a benefit to sending to Gdax first?

That's assuming bitcoin is recognized as an official currency worldwide. Or did you just mean that the current banking system will become "snail money" in the digital currency era? Most of our money is handled in digital transactions nowadays anyway (debit cards, credit cards, electronic payments  direct deposit, venmo, paypal, etc). Less and less people carry cash these days. Once bitcoin is recognized as an official currency around the world, then it will just compete with banks for storing your own money in the form of bitcoin... in essence becoming a bank (who did the same with gold). I dont think fiat will become "snail money" until bitcoin is accepted as payment everywhere, so until then, bitcoin NEEDS it. People love bitcoin because it translates to cold hard cash. (To be fair, i prefer people would go out and use it more instead of just hodling, but we'll get there eventually.)
Haven't had coffee yet, so don't take my rambling too seriously.

Not sure why any bank these days won't include that on a debit card, since it's required for online purchases (for obvious security reasons). Have you tried calling your bank and asking them what you should enter when filling out the box on an online purchase? Maybe see if they can replace your debit card for one with a 3 digit security code.

Ah, I thought by "3D secure feature" you were referring to the 3 digit security code (which is the CVV code) on the card. I had to google... From what I gather, 3D secure is something like the "Verified by Visa" pop-up that you'll see every now and then (depending on the merchant). I don't see how that would be required for you to buy crypto, though. Most wallets would just require to verify your identity and bank before letting you buy. I've added my card to mine and have not seen that security feature pop-up (definitely do need to include the cvv code, though, when making any instant purchases). Sorry that's not helpful. 
On a sidenote, for anyone confused about the difference between 3D Secure and CVV, I found this Amazon India support page useful:

ah, good to know. now is the transfer from gdax elsewhere also free? i need to get on this if it is!!!

you'll only need to report it once it's cashed out, because at that point, it's considered income.

i'm buying, but soooo wishing for it to drop a bit more. like black friday style drop please. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:23:19
Oh, i'm pretty set with the amount i'm hodling (got in after the whole gox thing), and did trade some of my new bitcoin cash for more btc during the weekend dip (at around 6200 i think, was hard to keep up), so it's no big deal. Just wish it went lower so i could get a better trade off! I mean if people were no longer interested in their btc, i'm more than happy to take it off their hands!

That has been how the bank system works since forever, and it's not going to change anytime within the next 10-20 years unless there's an economic collapse in the US, which at that point will screw bitcoin over too. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:12:11
You forgot tip. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:39:59
But the same can be said about economies collapsing as well. If a currency is devalued suddenly and you're sitting there with a ton of bills worth nothing, you too did nothing wrong, the system just failed. Not to say that it serves them right (i'm not cruel, i mean some people went all in with their life savings), but its just a risk thats taken. I dont know much about whats going on, but sure hope they can recover their investments somehow.

You are only getting bitcoin cash if you already had bitcoin on coinbase at the time the fork happened, and you're only meant to get the amount you would have gotten at that moment. Shouldn't matter if you moved it elsewhere after the fork, and won't get any for any additional bitcoin you purchased through coinbase after the fork. Now, whether it's worth anything or not come january, we'll see... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:28:15
They're not releasing anything until Jan 1st, but it really doesn't matter if you move it back, trade it off, or even sell it all and cash out. If you had bitcoin on coinbase on the day the fork happened, you should be getting your share of bitcoin cash on Jan 1st. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:37:28
Except bitcoiners (pre-fork) already own bitcoin cash though.

You can use td bank or citibank with no fees. Citi has no fees so long as you have a minimum in your account at all times ($500 i think). Td bank i dont know, but so many people tried getting me to go there under the "no fees to use your money" thing. Ive always had citibank, so i stick with them. The interest rate sucks though.

Not gonna lie. I really thought this was an on-going bitcoiners joke that prob started over a typo, but then yesterday it struck me that it could be internet talk for "hold on for dear life" (one of the rollercoaster memes made me see it)... Anyway, considering I'm no spring chicken, I instantly felt stupid. I can't keep up with the kids these days. But glad to see i wasn't the only one confused/wondering! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:37:17
Sitting here not freaking out cuz i got in when it was super cheap. Newbies spending their life savings when it got trendy recently, and now jumping ship to the next thing out of panic... ya'll are killing me.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:48:47
People need to start spending their bitcoin. It's meant to be a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:44:01
I waited... and waited... lol. oh well.
