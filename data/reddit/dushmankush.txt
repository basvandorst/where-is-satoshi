You cant stop the selling :D
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:26:53
Lmao see you at 6.8 in 72hours
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:03:44
If you like 6600 then you're going to love 4600.

Desperation reeks
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:21:34
Man you guys really are in fucking denial.
@_date: 2018-06-04 18:35:19
7700$ moon? Thats not even 40% of ATH. What will you call the pump from 2k to 3k?
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:28:45
I was wondering if we were close to the bottom and if my short should be closed but after reading your comment I've just added to it at 6500. 
Thanks for being delusional and may you continuing buying the dip all the way down to 5k and beyond. Although, I doubt that the most aggressive bulls among you are actually buying the dip. You and all the other moonboys are likely just trying to inject hopium into others so that they will buy. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:24:40
Cant wait to go mainstream guys, long ways off. Only 74% of the population, wow. We are early adopters guys
@_date: 2018-06-10 14:34:54
How many BTC did you buy at the cheap cheap price of 7700?
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:09:32
It's not too late to sell guys. Remember, 6700 &gt; 5000. It's mathematically proven. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:01:26
Why didn't you guys listen? 
@_date: 2018-06-24 00:44:13
Good on you to admit you're in this purely for the money. If so, i recommend selling now before it drops thousands more. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:04:58
Not too late to sell. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:34:54
Wow this sub is dead. Looks like a lot of hodlers are being converted into hedlers in this carnage ��
Sorry for your loss guys. Next time don't fomo into a Ponzi. 
Edit: sorry guys, I meant to say decentralized Ponzi. The fact that it's decentralized is of paramount importance. Don't want to confuse centralized and decentralized scams. ��

Let's all put our life savings and transfer the wealth of entire countries into BTC. What's a few generations of serfdom to the benefit of early adopters when we can have digital corn on an immutable ledger that nobody uses or spends. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:21:47
Dip buyers be like:
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:46:33
Scared of what? BTC has almost no utility, hardly anyone even uses it as a coin. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:39:41
Keep buying the dips until 3k guys, its the only strategy that works. Selling now and rebuying when the bubble has fully popped is for losers that like money.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:00:34
Please keep buying. I'm looking to unload on a run up to 12k if we get there. I'd really appreciate you holding my bags if it happens. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:48:59
Can anyone name a single utility that BTC offers right now to justify a 9k price valuation?
I need the answer for my school science project. Thanks guys.
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:26:34
No, it's sell high and buy low. People here don't even know what shorting an asset means. Keep hodling tulips lol...
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:30:38
Lol actually this just exposes how far off the rails most of the core devs are. To them it's either save or spend, it's like they have the economic understand/tunnel vision of pre-schoolers. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:08:42
Bitcoin has little to no utility. We are not investors, nobody here seriously thinks BTC is going to become the reserve currency of the world. We are all speculating and looking to unload bags on the suckers that keep buying dips.
EDIT: thought i was on r/Bitcoinmarkets so i spoke a bit too candidly. I meant to say moon hodl BTFD and 100k soon
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:31:08
I just can't but laugh now. You have no idea what an appeal to authority is if you're accusing me of it. What a clown. You represent this sub well. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:26:06
For the love of God Almighty please stop buying these "dips". These aren't dips, these are the first streams gushing through the cracks on the dam. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:14:12
"there are several alt-chain options for those who prefer on-chain scaling"
Really? Use an alt-coin in case it does turn into a hub and spoke centralized layer and for some reason you care about decentralization (silly you! dont you know that Moore's law has only been working for the past 30+ years and technology cant be assumed to improve after 2017?)
How about we use BITCOIN itself as "peer to peer electronic cash" as Satoshi intended? 
What do you think Andreas? Does that sound like a function bitcoin should probably perform?
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:46:48
This is fake news. You are a fudster. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:33:23
Its ok guys keep buying the dips. BTC is worth so much more than 8k in the long run, i mean theres more than 2 and a half major retailers worldwide accepting BTC. The value is limitless. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:44:03
Keep being emotionally ttached to numbers on a screen that do nothing for humanity. BTC is literally no better than timescale gold right now. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:14:31
Math checks out. Something something bcash prison something something gold 2.0 something something LN yawn. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:52:05
So blockstream and core don't have a virtual monopoly over BTC development? 
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:45:48
What's your point lol. Does LN have to be able to withstand DDoS attacks or not? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:50:01
Nice, LN only a few years away. :D

I've used it to buy antminer mining equipment as well as some merchandise and amazon giftcards. I use to do the latter all the time with bitcoin BTC, even bought some things on kijiji with bitcoin. All this talk of "digital gold" and the promotion of high fees as being "good for bitcoin" is just saddening and i know that with the passage of time even fewer people in crypto will know that bitcoin actually had some utility long ago beyond just being a useless speculative asset.
I've been in the space since 2012 and i just have no faith in the team behind bitcoin anymore. They have done nothing but hold adoption back by years and rip the community apart with their fanatical opposition to even a temporary 2x block size increase. I still hold BTC because the market can remain irrational longer than i can remain solvent but i will never trust this development team again.

Samsung unveils 30TB SSD. Poor you, betting against technological advancement. Just go join an Amish community.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:10:34
I really think 1m USD/BTC is virtually certain without a major flaw in the BTC code. Just consider the endless trillions being printed by central banks each year and the fact that the USD is depreciating against BTC at a rate of about 1000% annually for 9 straight years. 
However, when it does reach 1m you wont want to be trading precious BTC for fiat toilet paper anyway. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:01:35
Internet companies and services can handle DDoS attacks. You're using one right now genius but it doesn't mean they don't have to be able to fight off hostile attackers. 
If you think LN won't have any adversaries then goodluck with your delusions in 2018. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:17:01
Thats life dude, everyone gets ddos'd. If LN cant handle it then just lol at this being the panacea and see you boys at 2k/btc
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:34:06
In crypto since december 2017. How does it feel knowing you've never used bitcoin as a currency?
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:19:32
You speak as if its some fait-accompli that we should not. Frankly, who are you to decide which transactions are important to document? I do not propose myself as the arbiter on the matter nor do i accept you as one.

"In March 2008, just a few months before Satoshi’s paper on the Bitcoin protocol was published, Craig wrote Dave an email stating: “I need your help editing a paper I am going to release later this year. I have been working on a new form of electronic money. Bit cash, Bitcoin . . . [y]ou are always there for me Dave. I want you to be part of it all.”
Just quoting the lawsuit boys, go ahead and downvote me for making you actually read a part of it.

Litecoin is trash, stop drinking their cool-aid. If BTC works and LN scales then why would anyone need LTC? hint; they wont
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:06:43
Do you even bitcoin transaction? 2$ per transaction is more expensive than paypal
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:08:32
Sorry sir but you are wrong. People dont just sell bitcoin, they hodl because its going to 10x this year. NEVER SELL!
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:39:14
Guy with lots of bitcoin says bitcoin price will rise and tells others to buy bitcoin. You can take his word for it.
@_date: 2018-04-06 01:39:30
Cringe lmao. Sorry for your bags bro. Should have listened to your crazy roomate in freshman year and bought a few dozen Bitcoin so you could have dumped them on some hodlr heads in December. 
It's too late now, there will never again be a new all time high for you to profit let alone get 100x returns 
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:58:32
How can price go down when institutional investors are buying tens of thousands of BTC over the counter?
This doesnt make any sense guys. Hodl me and tell me its gonna be ok :(
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:20:18
ok nocoiner, just lmao if you dont think Soros will pump all our bags and make us rich. Get a clue noob
