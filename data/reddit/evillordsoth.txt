Yeah. Higher income tax brackets that trigger cap gains going above 15% for long term held assets [start at over $400,000 per year in declared income]( 
If you think that OP's personal dream of buying his own car with his bitcoin gains ALSO has him declaring over 400,000 in income this year then you and trav MIGHT be correct. 
But it's pretty fucking unlikely. 
It's far far far more likely that OP pays 15% or less on any gains he declares. He bought a Mazda, not 9 Maseratis.

I don't think you understand how the AMT works.
I'm not a tax professional, but if you held the asset for more than 1 year its 15% for cap gains. Not whatever crazy shit you came up with.

Let me introduce you to my $4500 keyboard. Or my many thousand dollar graphics cards.
Is what it is, if I were to look at it the same way for the things I sold for bitcoin I may have one of the highest selling tf2 hats of all time! I got 4 btc for a nuts and bolts team captain back when btc was cheap.
Is what it is.

Yup. You’re going to get downvoted, because of the HODL meme people. I spend mine too. Best way to send money internationally if both people are tech savvy.

It's a razer blackwidow with blues that I paid 1.05 of a btc for when btc was around $100 it has 2 LEDs out, and the usb controller doesn't work.

Have you looked at how sites like nicehash have handled their hacks and paid people back slowly rather than declare bankruptcy?

Sure dude I'll take a look at your solar suppliers, I am currently speccing out at .65 cents a watt for 320 watt panels. Ali express seems to be around there too.

I wish you all the best of luck selling candy around this time of year.
I can't even walk to my users desks without being offered free candy at least twice.
I guess that isn't any particular fault of bitcoin or USD though.

Humble bundle yesterday, and the week before I paid my friend for a concert ticket he bought for me!
