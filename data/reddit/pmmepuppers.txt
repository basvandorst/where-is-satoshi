I don't respect people who can't use the correct form of 'your' and 'you're' :)

First of all, this is an amazing thing you're doing and I applaud you for it. Thank you! Would it be possible to do something to fund the net neutrality fight?

Aw man tell me where the mean frat boys touched you in college. Or did they just steal your girlfriend?

Is there a r/iamverysmart for cryptos?

Lol you have zero clue of how much I have invested in the big 3 and my alts of choice. And unlike you I’m not an arrogant idiot who will disclose that to the internet

How does the fare for future innovations? I don’t know enough about the situation there, but if BTC is linked to being successful after the hyperinflation they went through, how could this affect the macro economics behind how we, governments, and economists view BTC?

How much do you trust your friend? I'd be skeptical. In fact I just wouldn't mix financial investments and friendships and just buy from GDAX. 
That being said I am not his friend and will gladly buy below market price if he wants to sell to me

This stresses me out. Please tell me he has paid the loan back already

Consultants are not overpaid. Do you think we see even 15% of that rate? 
To your in house staff comment, you do train users in house on the tech. You bring in consultants for a niche area of the tech that just isn't feasible for teaching to staff. Why spend all the money and resources training someone in something that you will see very rarely? Also, independence is a issue that comes up where it isn't legal to do something in house.

I think the next question you should ask is when you should put your $100 (or whatever in). Pre or post fork

you're changing your stance. you just said you cant have a blockchain with a coin, now that someone presented to you a new application that uses blockchain without a coin your argument is it won't take off

500 a DAY? I know that sounds like a ton but that is dirt cheap. I'm in consulting and 500 is more like an hourly rate.

God Bravo. I would frame that post in your (assuming) mansion.
