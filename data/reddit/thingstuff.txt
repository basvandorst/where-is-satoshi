Why do you care so much about what idiots think?
Also, why are you telling these people about your investments?

Due to the weakness of the Lira and (I think more importantly) the prevailing political climate in Turkey, many are looking for ways to get their money securely out of the country. Bitcoin is an obvious means.

The core devs author proposed changes. Network consensus is what does or does not implement them.
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:28:45
That's a fair point.
I really can't imagine a scheme in which change proposal becomes completely apolitical. 
At least not without some kind of benevolent AI.

I own dentacoin, because bitcoin can't improve my dental health.

Yeah, you're actually paying another middleman as well. You pay VISA, then you also pay your payment processor a cut- and also sign an agreement that lets both of them use all data collected to the fullest extent regional laws will allow.

It's 3 times as high as it was at the end of last summer.

Yeah, it totally sucks that Bitcoin found a bottom 100% higher than the ceiling was about a year ago.

If your "experience" has lead you to believe that blockchain and related tech has absolutely no application aside from currency then I'm guessing your "experience" doesn't involve much research or critical thought.
@_date: 2018-04-14 00:28:50
You're taking your negative projection of the worst among us and applying it to everyone. You may be as feeble minded as those you criticize, but fortunately many are not.

If you had researched even a few you would understand that the majority of altcoins don't compete with bitcoin. Currency/Value Storage is just one application of this branch of technology.

When people ask you what happened here, tell them people who sold on the way down and bought on the way up remember.

Semantics. What is implied by his statement is that core utility of Bitcoin has the potential to be more important to those people than the general use case of the internet for those people (without Bitcoin).
