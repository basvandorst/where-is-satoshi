Please, for branding and consistency sake, type Bitcoin with a lowercase c.

I guess I need to dust off this novelty account and begin correcting people again.

We should point at people who don't understand the importance of consistency of branding, and who post threads on Reddit, calling it "BitCoin" instead of "Bitcoin".

It's Bitcoin, not BitCoin.

Love the idea.
It's lower case "c" in Bitcoin, by the way.  Not sure if that's the error you are referring to.
