Actually, it is empirically true. The whole concept of the time value of money comes with the time preference of humans. And irrationality generally stems from humans preferring now over later even though later may bring more value. 
Humans don't just live long, destitute lives knowing that their money with be worth more tomorrow.

Not sure what I could link you to, but arbitrary speculative bounds are a big part of [barrier option]( strategy. USD parity is magnetic like barrier option "in-out" parity.
I don't know what kind of calculations you're running, but know that most economic models (especially simulations) presume a 100% commercial market. Bitcoin is almost entirely a speculation market, which may explain what might look like anomalies. Further, trade volume is elevated by the triviality of large volume trades.
If you're looking into modeling Bitcoin economic heuristics, it has even more similarities to a small pond penny stock than a currency!

I might be an exceptional case.

I'm mostly interested in Bitcoin because it's a new community with potential (in a subject that compels me). As a fledgling developer, I've been able to create tools that people use before people like me saturate the community. There's a lot of room to create Bitcoin-related apps, websites, and tools that currently have no main player.

How blatantly loud they were about it doesn't matter. Government scrutiny inevitable. In fact, bring on the loud so that we can stress test this now rather than later.

Brilliant animations. I'm glad someone made a respectable video after listening to some of the ideas thrown around in the pledge thread (which was at 2,500 BTC last time I checked)

Note: US Dollar parity is always a speculative barrier. Until a new currency reaches parity, it hasn't reached parity yet. And once it's reached parity, people naturally don't want to pay a premium over parity.
In other words, US Dollar parity is pretty magnetic to speculation.

[Time Preference]( says hello. 
Economies don't "grind to a halt" just because people's assets will increase in the future. People don't outright cease buying goods and services just because their dollar is worth more tomorrow. They'll save more, but they won't stop consuming the things they need and the toys they can't afford.
Because people don't collect money to live long destitute lives, maybe spending it if they don't die first.

But "care" isn't very persuasive. Nor does it capture the point that 90% of your search engine traffic comes through Google. Nor does that 3-year-old article tell you that Yahoo/Bing have such different results from Google because they're playing catch-up and adopting Google's practices over time.
I wonder if bit-coin-trading.com also stuffs meta-keywords and uses the "Submit a URL" button at Lycos.

Reminds me that I need to cash in the 15 WingBucks I've accumulated at my local buffalo wings sports bar.

You're not going to mine any without some really good hardware like GPUs in series.
I recommend stop trying. The days of easy mining are long gone.

Jessy Kang is awesome. Great references to Warren Buffet on [castles &amp; moats]( and 37signals' [Rework]( Crystal clear insights into the adult industry. 
It sucks to see someone so genuinely unappreciated for sharing their experience and then get accused of malice and condescension. Really? Thank god TheVirus showed up quick with some support. How nauseating.
She even spells out and qualifies an entire business model: 
Favorite Vegetta quote:


[Dunning-Kruger effect]( indeed.

"bit-coin-trading.com" 
What an awful domain name. Why are some people so deadset on keyword-embedded URLs?
It isn't 1999.
