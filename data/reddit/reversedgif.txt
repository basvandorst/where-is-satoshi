This indicates you don't understand how difficulty scales with increasing length. It's exponential.

If 7/8 of the private key were visible, the search space would be reduced to 2^(160 * 7/8) = 2^20 (~1 million possibilities).

It is effectively a random search. The set of possible block solutions is virtually infinite.
The probability of a single attempt solving a block is always the same, independent of how many times you've tried before; it's 1/2^32/difficulty.

No, "Probability_to_find_a_block" only depends on *your* hashrate, not the global one.

Using a logarithmic graph for this purpose does make a lot more sense. Markets operate multiplicatively, not additively. If you have steady growth (say, 10% per year), it will be a straight line on a logarithmic plot, but an exponential curve on a linear plot. As another example, a fit on a linear plot could potentially predict negative prices, but that will never happen on a logarithmic plot.
TL;DR: Logarithmic plot is the right choice here.
