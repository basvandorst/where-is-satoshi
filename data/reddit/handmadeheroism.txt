Oh I have the exact same problem with cex.io, my transaction   is stuck for several days and reading around i figured out that many people have the exact same problem as they batch too many items in a single tx, Did you manage to do anything? Please dont let this go esp considering it to be a lot of money. Call them up on their number, they need to fix this.

Why are you selective in replying to messages, why no reply to my posts on BTC withdrawal?

CEX.IO is a big scam and I dont use the word lightly and I will show you how.
CEX.IO collects the recommended transaction fee while withdrawing from their account from each person. 
i.e Fee: Ƀ 0.00100000
You can check this in their site but they DO NOT USE THIS FEE to transfer, instead they bunch a huge number of transactions and just pay a part of it. Dont believe me check this
Now this has made the transaction impossible to confirm, you can see the tx is unconfirmed since a long time and this is not a rare case. 
Check this too 
If you check bitcointalk you can find many such complaints, please do not use cex.io and if you do, do not deposit/withdraw high amounts unless you want to be scammed.
