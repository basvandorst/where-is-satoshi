Because PR, in this case, means taking advantage of the naive.

Just want Amazon wants, a 1% processor rife with fraud rather than the 2-3% processor that will accept every hacking loss as a cost of business. Gee, wonder who's gunna win..

Yeah, that's business. Maybe I'm disillusioned, but I thought bitcoin was supposed to be above the bullshit that business has presented to our everyday lives. Now it's just another reason to buy into the stock market? OK, then.

They started taking bitcoin for the free advertising and sales from the cult-like following it has... for people like [this](
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:13:17
No, were you fucked as a child?


Like you? Go ahead, follow the cult and prop up your fucking washed up business. Ironic that you're telling me what a tool is.

Let's be honest, overstock.com is hanging off of the entrails of the commercials they had going 5 years ago. No one uses them anymore, their products are overpriced, and this is a PR move, plain and simple.

Apparently he was there through the demise, was the CEO until 9/1/2010 ...

In the future, your response to something like this should be "nunya" ... there's no reason for them to know why you want your property.

It's a repeated pattern of failure, and a statement made days ago which completely discredits his current, proposed strategy. As far as I'm concerned, this reeks of manipulation and is another tick on the list of shadiness involved with bitcoin as of late.

Wait, didn't digg decline to sell for hundreds of million until eventually it was sold for nothing? Why would I take any advice from this guy?
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:52:23
Which is the most anti-capitalist idea possible, leading me to sell at the first hint of major regulation.

If you plan to cash out with MtGox be prepared to not need that money for months. They are notoriously bad with paying out, many of those in the know have abandoned them and for that reason there's a button to ignore their values on bitcoinaverage.com

Not ONE person here is interested in what the actual article reported? There's no interest in actual discussion here. What a cesspool. 
FWIW, here's the frontpage bitcoin article on the USATODAY Money section: 
It's completely negative.

This may just be the ultimate first world problem...

It was the financial collapse of Cyprus that lead to billionaires adopting it and leading the first push across $100 for bitcoin. You're right in that most people don't care or are ignorant to the risks they face holding money in banks as it stands, but we don't need the masses to adopt it for bitcoin to be successful, just more of the big players - it would all trickle down from there.

The fact that you can buy gold by the gram or even milligram rather than by the ounce doesn't make gold less scarce. What you said does not make any sense.

You're right, Rose was only CEO from 4/2010 - 9/2010 but he was the one who rolled out V4 which was apparently the demise of digg ... while this isn't necessary relevant and the guy still has a job with Google Venture, it bothers me that this type of flowery idealist optimism from someone with a past of failing to adapt to the future is met with applause.
EDIT: Here's his idea on emotional attachment to bitcoin due to your idealism after cashing out at $500, taken from his last comment he registered under this username:
"If I had to guess, I'd say you're scared to sell because you're afraid of missing the upside or not timing it right, you're afraid of losing money. You have to take emotion out of the picture, then you'll be your best investing self."
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:52:35
This is possibly the most naive and ignorant comment I've ever seen here.

It's not "perceived" scarcity. That is when a cartel like DeBeers keeps the available supply of diamonds artificially low in order to drive up the price. The scarcity of bitcoins is real and it's mathematical. The price hike we're seeing is due to speculation, and that can and has certainly lead to bubbles, but this isn't the same as investing in stocks. You can't trade stocks for goods and services, so as that becomes easier to do with bitcoin, it leaves less incentive to cash out and more to ride it out.

Unfortunately, I bet either of our responses get added to a "closer inspection" list.
