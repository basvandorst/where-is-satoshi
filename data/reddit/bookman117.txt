This is a good point, but all it could mean is that the point at which people would prefer to hoard bitcoins than spend them (and thus bursting the bubble) won't happen for a few more years at least. However, the fact that the distribution of bitcoins is already so lopsided would seem to belie this. My point about the necessity of having a fiat currency with a central bank still stands though. At some point, for the bitcoin economy to grow more, you're gonna have to mint more bitcoins.

I don't have any bitcoins, I plan on buying some and trying to sell them as close to the peak as possible before the epic collapse arrives. Look, the problems with bitcoins are the same problems that existed with the gold standard. Read here for more:

Bad idea. Read the post.

"Once Bitcoin gets more widely traded the intra-day volatility will calm down."
Given that there are a finite number of bitcoins, there are a finite number of transactions that can take place at once. With a currency you need some scarcity because if there were an infinite number of bitcoins (say you could easily just make a digital copy) then it would be worthless. But if there were only one bitcoin in existence then the bitcoin economy would be limited to one transaction at a time (or no transactions if it didn't exist at all). The purpose of a central bank is to walk a balance somewhere between these two, and that's why a currency needs one.

"Google and apple should issue more shares too. Their prices should be stable as well."
See, that's my point: right now bitcoin's valuation is behaving much more like a stock in a company than a currency. It has to choose between one or the other, except that unlike stock in Google or Apple (which derive their value from the products those companies make) bitcoin has no intrinsic value. The only value it has is the expectation that people will trade things with intrinsic value for bitcoins. Therefore if the demand goes up drastically, more of them need to be produced to facilitate more transactions. This would create bitcoin inflation which would cause the value to go back down again.

Wealth != currency by any stretch of the imagination. If I owned all the land in Manhattan (or 90% of Apple's stock) but had only ten thousand dollars, my net worth would be valued in the billions.

I'm saying its going to gyrate in value like crazy, which isn't what you want in a currency. Read this article on the gold standard for more:

But is it getting the point that people would rather hold on to it than spend it? Once that happens and everyone realizes it, the party's over. The only way to keep that from happening is to mint more of them, which nobody can do.

"If 1e-8 bitcoins is worth US$1000, then the protocol is changed to add another 8 decimal places."
So there is an inflationary mechanism built into the currency once it has appreciated past a certain point, and the "hard limit" on the number of bitcoins in existence thus doesn't actually exist? So in principle it is in fact a fiat currency? I hadn't heard of this before. The question then is whether the amount a bitcoin has to be worth before more are created is low enough to actually make a difference. Given how much the value has been rocketing up and down recently, I doubt it. You want stability in a currency because without stable prices shit gets too chaotic. I don't want to work for 8 hours and receive bitcoins in exchange only for it to be worth 15% less the next day. That kind of shit happened when we were on the gold standard, as my links below to that atlantic article demonstrate.

"Bitcoins can be broken up so there would be zero need to produce more to facilitate more transactions."
What happens when 1*10^-8 bitcoins is worth $1000?
"People and businesses will both accept and use it. Why? Because businesses can get away from bank domination. Now people can transfer money around the world and it only costs the use of electricity, instead of hundreds in bank transfer fees. This makes the current bank model obsolete." 
The reasons banks suck is because they operate on a heads-I-win-tails-taxpayers-lose basis when it comes to trading in exotic financial instruments, not because they charge fees. Also, this is why paypal and credit unions exist.

I'm not saying it's bad for the US economy. I'm saying it's bad for the bitcoin economy. Look, if demand for bitcoins ever reaches a point that people would rather hoard them than spend them, the value will go into free fall. The job of a central bank is to create more currency and cause inflation well before this kind of epic collapse happens. The currency doesn't have to be the primary means of exchange for a particular national economy like the dollar for this to be true. Right now, there is in fact a bitcoin economy where people trade computers and labor and dollars for bitcoin. The entire purpose of bitcoin is to facilitate transactions in this economy. That's the economy I'm talking about. 
"Well, more gold can't be created... is that bad for the economy? No."
No, because gold is just a commodity now, not a currency. Back when we were on the gold standard, in fact this was a very bid deal. Read up on William Jennings Bryan and his "Cross of Gold" speech.

This is a non sequitur.
