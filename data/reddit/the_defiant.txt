I think this is exactly what is achieved when you say stop price 15’000 limit sell 14‘500.
At 15’000 the limit sell order with sell price 14’500 will be created. The sell price in this case is the minimum price at which the order is executed. For a limit buy it would be the maximum price you are willing to pay for the buy order to be executed.

That is bullshit. Did a transaction from my ledger Nano  (high fee, 15$) last week. Took 4 hours to get two confirmations. Saying we don‘t have a problem won‘t magically make it go away.
Edit: From Segwit address.

I am not going to post anything as one would see the remaining balance on that address, but I have no interest in spreading FUD as BTC is quite a significant part of my portfolio. And I do still believe in it. But as someone who has been using it for almost two years and then also recently after a long HODL I was shocked how bad the experience was compared to even a few months ago. We do have a problem currently (even with Segwit) and if you don't notice you have not been around long.

Many thanks, I'll look into it! Also thanks to that one person who already sent something! You rock!

I’ve checked it out and as the project involves multiple entities (on existing testnet interfaces) this will not work. I still need some testnet coins, any help is appreciated.

Yes some people are brainwashed and don‘t want to hear the truth.

I traveled in Argentina for 1 month last year - never seen Banco Masventas, so it‘s probably a smaller institution.

Thanks for doing this.

Yes, cash or debit card.

It was granted to another firm too:  [

As a Swiss: while this is nice I see no benefit in using these machines when there is a combined fee of roughly 8% (compared to the 1.5% Coinbase is charging for example).
It might be nice if SBB (the national rail company), who the machines belong to opened their services to BTC though, as public transport is used literally by everyone in Switzerland and they are the biggest player.

Bitcoin is the money of the people - if some choose to trust another party more than themselves to manage their keys it‘s their right to do so.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:24:52
Yeah but fuck it we need a solution for the high fees.

Where do you pay your income and wealth taxes, in France? If so, you should declare it there under assets even if you don’t have to. My reasoning: Wealth tax is almost zero and therefore there is little negative impact on my actual taxes. But if I one day sell and cannot show where that sudden income comes from I might get in trouble.
I don’t think the currency is relevant, even if I sold my holdings against EUR it would be a taxable event. So not really sure what you’re trying to do here.

It’s a social contract and while it is enforced it is not as negative or economically harmful as you make it sound. A government is only as bad as the people it is made of. Efficient governments such as in the Nordics have massively positive effects on the economy as well as on other metrics of a society.
As a Swiss I also take pride in paying my taxes so that my country can keep flourishing. I see that the money is invested into education and infrastructure. I know that homeless people will always get shelter and food if they seek it. This is the kind of society I want to live in and pay for.

I am already declaring my holdings on the tax forms in Switzerland, but only as assets not yet as income (as I haven‘t sold anything yet).

BTC yes. If you leave it on Coinbase you will only have access to whatever coin they support (they are still endorsing 2x afaik).

You might be thinking of another coin -XRP?

Ok not sure since googling yields something different than what you are saying. Let's say I bought BTC with coinbase and paid all fees. Now I want to move it to my Ledger Nano. Am I paying any other besides the network transaction fee? If yes, do you have a source?
What about I've been hodling and want to send the BTC back to my coinbase address to sell via them. Am I paying any fees besides the transaction fee and their selling fee?
In my opinion, both answers should be no, but happy to concede should I be wrong.
