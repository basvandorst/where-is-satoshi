I thought it was an abbreviation for, "hold on for dear life".

You mean the mBTC?

Bitcoin is creating a demand for low cost, efficient, and perhaps even green energy. This demand will be met by the free market with fierce competition, driving the cost of electricity down while creating hundreds if not thousands of jobs.

This is already on bitcoin.org..?

Market cap in this context is a useful measurement. No one said it was perfect or that it perfectly illustrates the asset in question. It’s just useful.

An exchange is simply a facilitator of P2P transactions; all an exchange does is allow people to place buy and sell bids for Bitcoin or whatever is being traded. If you're suggesting that we'd be better off without using exchanges, than how can you also believe that we would be hurt if the government shut down these exchanges?

This is why Bitcoin will become a deflationary currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:27:17
Again, useful, not perfect.

What a strawman argument. “The only possible reason why you don’t agree with me is because you don’t understand the subject”.

According to Satoshi Nakamoto’s white-paper, everyone on the network is in consensus with the current state of the Bitcoin Blockchain (the value of everyone’s addresses) and, by extension, the wealth distribution thereof. Also, judging the “wealth gap” between Bitcoin addresses doesn’t reflect accurately on the wealth gap between the actual people on the Bitcoin network. This is because people can generate addresses at will and typically own several addresses at a time in their wallet. Not to mention, Bitcoin supports micro-payments and automation, meaning that most addresses are used just once for small transactions or are generated and used by robots for one-time payments.

The only way this post could exist in 20 words and make sense is if the reader had past knowledge. Educate yourself on how Bitcoin works like the rest of us.

This guy's Reddit profile is filled with posts about getting rich quick with his help. It's like he's not even TRYING to hide the fact that he's a scammer. HE SHOULD BE BANNED FROM R/BITCOIN!!!
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:11:14
First off, he did make that claim in the video at time 2:10. 
Secondly, I agree with everything else you said. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:30:45
Just because it's offline doesn't mean that transactions sent to this device's address aren't on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:47:27
This guy should be banned from this sub. Scammer. 
The act of sending Bitcoin to another address is fast, cheap, irrevocable and untraceable. I don't care who you are, the fact remains that you are trying to scam people all while understanding that the law can do nothing to help your victims. And by the way, I feel insulted on behalf of myself and everyone else on this sub for you to come on here and think that we'll all fall for your stupid tricks. Regardless of all this, you are misusing this subreddit anyways, and should be banned JUST for that. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:53:07
Good call. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:52:30
I don't think you'll ever see the point that I'm trying to make, so I'll just give up now and let the community eat you alive. You're a scam artist and no one believes you. No one is going to send you Bitcoin and no one needs your 'service' to invest Bitcoin. We can do it ourselves just fine thank you very much.

The only problem with this meme is that bitcoiners are single and live with their parents (me). 
@_date: 2017-06-27 22:32:57
Lol don't report it.

Did you allow it through your computer's firewall, as well as your router's? 
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:07:37
Allow it through your firewall.
