Good advice.  Thank you!

Thank you. You're right.  I do think it will increase long term.  I kind of worked it out as I was typing.  Funny how I can sit and think about something for days, and the moment I seek someone else's help,  I figure it out.
I don't plan to purchase a lot or anything that will be missed. I just went to buy at multiple times this week and it keeps going up! That's the trouble with "to the moon"!  I'll purchase some shortly.

Well, I made one purchase and it took off, so i doubted the process.  You're right...that is the point.

Thank you very much.  I do try to be pleasant.  I had hoped my post sounded more educated than a standard newb just looking for advice on when to buy, because I have been researching this.  
I appreciate your friendly advice regarding not investing more than I can afford to lose.  I definitely am not investing more than I can afford to lose.  This is very minimal money and with these purchases, I've been paying with my credit card rewards, so it actually not costing ME anything. 
If it plummets to zero, I will have lost a few dollars, nothing I'd lose any sleep but the dream would be a greater loss.
I spend a lot of time in personal finance, so I'm sure to have my emergency fund ready, my 401k is at a decent contribution, my home and vehicle are in good standing with early payoffs looming and I have a very good credit score. So, this is just fun money.  
I think I worried more about the idea of buying at the top and feeling foolish than the money itself. That feeling that the whole world knows something you don't.  That bothers me more than the financial loss. 
I really appreciate your kind words and the kind words of most on the thread to what may have seemed like a fairly silly question.  :)

Hahaha I should try that. I feel like I've thought over and over and over again in my own mind about it, and then as soon as I committed to writing it, I had figured it out.  
It's amazing how you get to where you need to be just by relaying your thought process to another.

I'm glad no one knows. I guess in my mind, it behaves kind of like a stock and meets some resistance at certain points.  It was climbing to where it was at the beginning of the year when it garnered a lot of media attention. I was figuring, "watch, I'll buy it, and it'll hit the news, hit a lot of resistance and drop".  It's certainly been fun to watch the price this week.  Other times, I'm sure it will not be as fun.
I have been learning a lot about bitcoin itself.  I've listened to many presentations on YouTube and have been reading a lot.  I do struggle to understand some of it.  Some of it I think it just thinking in archaic terms of money as we know it, that I just can't escape when it comes to bitcoin.  I do need to do more on storage.  Thanks for the insight!

Fair enough. Guess I was more afraid of a steady climb, buying high only for it to fall. 
I guess I do fear the process some. 
I'll have to either have more faith in the DCA process.

Thank you.  I appreciate that.  
Before I even bought any bitcoin...probably last summer, I downloaded BitCore, but couldn't figure it out.  It's the first time, I truly felt I was getting older and not as tech savvy as I was in the past (I'm 36).
I saved a post indicating how to move coins from say, CoinBase to a wallet.  I figured once I made a few purchases, I'd get that off the ground.  That's what folks mean by cold storage?
Thank you for your kind words.  It's very exciting!  It's always fun to dream of this going to the moon, but it's also so practical, it makes it easy to believe in it. I play poker online, from the US, and BitCoin is HUGE in this arena.  I really feel it will open doors and break boundaries. That's just my experience with it!

Do you think it will only go down?
I wish I asked this earlier in the week, because my defense of this response is illuminating.

I hope you were able to recover your BTC off these CDs.  
I've had CD's for twice as long as this that are still playing music and have no issues. So, hopefully, you won't have any issues.
