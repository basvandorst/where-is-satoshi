This is false. BTC and alts will likely dip quite a bit, but they will not be worth nothing, just because a big altcoin turned out to be a scam. How about bitconnectcoin, it's a scam, it's almost gone, it was worth about 4 billion dollars (Tether is 2B). How about if some other 2B coin tanked - VeChain, OmiseGO, Populous. If all 3 disappeared overnight, nothing too negative would happen to BTC and other alts.
I've observed that pumps happen after new tether issuance but people want to be oblivious. They are blaming "gov shutdown" on pump over 12k when 200M of tether was printed just hours before the pump. I see convincing link, but others just don't want to. Upvoting, but you're going to get buried.

There are thousands of banks. Having a local branch is nice but, some online-only banks refund ATM fees if you need to withdraw cash, provide free debit card, and free checks. Many of them offer depositing checks by taking a photo with a smartphone. And again - there are 2 ways to avoid the $12 monthly fee.
When I moved my direct deposit from bank A to bank B, bank A started charging me $13/month. Guess how much they made off me? $13. Because I went to the branch and closed the checking, savings, and credit card accounts with them, and told them why I closed them. Losing one customer didn't hurt them all that much. It was mostly for my own satisfaction.

Bank lends 90% or $900 not $9000. The loan funds get deposited and 90% of new deposit are loaned out again. Over time through the cycles it comes out to be about 9x the original deposit. Fractional reserve means banks keep a fraction of all deposits and lend out 90 cents on the dollar. How the hell do you lend out $9k if you only got $1k?

The exchange setting fees part is correct. The inputs and outputs don't matter in this case. If your transaction was 1KB your fee would be 0.00001 or 11 cents at 1 sat per byte. The blocks are nowhere near full on bcash and miners will mine all transactions in queue even ones paying less than that. Every block clears their queue right now. The only stuff that remains is probably 0 fee tx.

A-3: Yes. A taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services
must, in computing gross income, include the fair market value of the virtual currency, 
measured in U.S. dollars, as of the date that the virtual currency was received. See
Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on
miscellaneous income from exchanges involving property or services.
Q-4: What is the basis of virtual currency received as payment for goods or
services in Q&amp;A-3?
A-4: The basis of virtual currency that a taxpayer receives as payment for goods or
services in Q&amp;A-3 is the fair market value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the
date of receipt. See Publication 551, Basis of Assets, for more information on the
computation of basis when property is received for goods or services.

If you need a practical reason to avoid having any money in bcash look at the hashrate  That is security that the blockchain system relies on. At 2.2 exahashes the chain can be 51% attacked by BTC miners if they wanted to, do some nefarious things with blocks, cause people to lose money and all trust in bcash. It would be dumped real quick. Even without BTC miners there is probably one big bcash miner accounting for 80% of the hashrate. That's centralized AF. Nothing at all like Satoshi's whitepaper which they present as evidence for all arguments.

Nope. Never said nothing about immunity to crashing.
I am familiar with the tether situation to a degree. It is said to be sloshing on bitfinex a lot and lately on binance. It is being used to buy more than one coin. These are allegations that are not easy to prove, but pumps in BTC eerily coincide with new issuance. 2 billion USDT is probably responsible for a big premium on many coins. But.. it does not diminish the promise of bitcoin. Discount for the premium, assuming USDT WILL implode eventually. So BTC price "should be" about $5,000 right now? Fine. It is not zero. Quite a bit of healthy interest that will buy the dips. Those who want to cash out can only do it once.
There is leveraged trading but not to the point how CDSs worked. If I recall correctly Goldman's ex-CEO ran the Treasury Dept and MADE SURE that AIG got bailed out so that it can pay up what it owes to Goldman. This kind of blatant manipulation and conflicts of interest are above and beyond what exists in bitcoin trading.

I imagine this being the average, it includes fees for transactions that exchanges make, and those are batched to include lots of outputs and thus are large and have very high fees.
Looking at the representation of mempool on one of the nodes that I linked, I can see in real-time, and going back a day or two, the required fees in satoshis per byte. As an individual, most of my transactions are 1 to 2, or 226 bytes.

Mind that miners can always soft cap block sizes. Even if block size limit was bumped to 2MB it doesn't mean miners would start making 2MB blocks, at least not right away. Let's say they wanted the fees and mined full 2MB blocks. If that was the case implementing segwit is less burdensome at this time, since most blocks are only slightly larger than 1MB. Segwit also fixes tx malleability, asicboost mining bug, and offers other benefits like making LN more straightforward to implement. Segwit was not specifically called out as a capacity increase, though it does that too as more and more users and services shift to using segwit addresses.

This is false. BTC and alts will likely dip quite a bit, but they will not be worth nothing, just because a big altcoin turned out to be a scam. How about bitconnectcoin, it's a scam, it's almost gone, it was worth about 4 billion dollars (Tether is 2B). How about if some other 2B coin tanked - VeChain, OmiseGO, Populous. If all 3 disappeared overnight, nothing too negative would happen to BTC and other alts.


That's not necessarily accurate. It may be the main goal for you but people have different priorities.
I've observed that pumps happen after new tether issuance but people want to be oblivious. They are blaming "gov shutdown" on pump over 12k when 200M of tether was printed just hours before the pump. I see convincing link, but others just don't want to. Upvoting, but you're going to get buried.

Read the basics on your own, see sidebar. Come back with a sensible question.
Blockchain stores transactions. Miners add blocks and extend the blockchain. Other coins have their own chain of blocks with transactions and their own miners and they have nothing to do with bitcoin's chain, except maybe copying most of it like bcash did.
Other coins attempt to have purposes to differentiate themselves and make developers rich. A clone of bitcoin with minor changes like litecoin or bcash have no reason to exist really, so they are promoted as "better" in some way than bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not money or currency. Its one purpose and utility is as payment for writing to bitcoin blockchain. You must have bitcoin to do this. Writing to bitcoin blockchain is what transactions are, reassigning some bitcoins from one key to another in a secure manner. This utility makes bitcoins valuable. People ascribe attributes of money to bitcoin and trade it for goods and services as if it was money.

What other coins don't have is unmatched security. They are not unstoppable, unseizable, uncontrollable. ETH staying alive by relying on repeated hard forks with 2 weeks notice. Other coins don't have hashrates that are economically infeasible to 51% attack and rewrite history. It's not that you need to do it a lot and double spend money for a while, it's the attack if done once will likely result in the coin losing trust and be sold off into obscurity.

You can trade it for other coins but I think only kraken has USDT for USD trading pair. You may be hard pressed to find so much liquidity. You buy $200 million worth of tethers - to get back to USD you buy bitcoin then sell bitcoin for USD, incurring fees and slippage along the way. You get back less than $200 million. So that's not very efficient.
Also since tether company will not give you back USD for tethers you can only trade with it with other suckers who might want it. If all of a sudden nobody wanted tethers you'd be stuck holding the bag.

That's just not feasible. 2nd layer solutions will need to be developed. I don't think bitcoin will continue to rule forever, it will be supplanted by better tech most likely. Nobody is forcing you to buy it.

You say "When Paypal or a credit card is used, massive transaction fees are charged." - I do not get charged any fees for using a credit card on amazon. Yes, amazon is charged and it all gets rolled into their costs and passed on to the customers. I don't see any massive transaction fees though.
You say "Bitcoin Offers: Low transaction costs" - No it doesn't.
You say "Bitcoin Offers: Decentralized currency" - This is not a financial benefit to amazon or anyone.
I can't sign this nonsense until it's written in factually correct statement with actual benefits to amazon. (Benefits to customers are secondary, since you're asking amazon to take on challenge/expense it needs to be worth it for them.)

There is no reason to jack up fees on bcash. Nobody uses that crap, their blocks are like 0.2MB in size, any fee over 0 will likely get confirmed.

People who understand how fees work, and can use any number or mempool monitoring websites to set fees with precision, don't see any of this as magical or amazing.
Amount sent - irrelevant. Confirmed in 3 minutes - also irrelevant. That's when the block was mined, no amount of fees could mine it any sooner or any later. If the transaction was sorting near the top of 1MB of data, it got into the next block.

Yeah it's likely one of the better ones for GPU mining since ethash doesn't have an ASIC yet as far as I know. There are sites like coinwarz.com or whattomine.com for research. ETH will also change to proof of stake eventually, meaning no more mining. Then you can mine ethereum classic.

Mining is competitive so that dweebs don't add random fake transactions to the blockchain, double spending same coins. It's expensive to mine blocks so miners are mining valid ones with valid transactions only, so that they get the 12.5 btc block reward.

Demand for electricity will be commensurate with mining profitability. Infinite electricity costs infinite amount of money so to claim electricity use will go up indefinitely is intellectually deficient. It's a self-balancing system. Miners can mine at a loss only until they run out of funds. As they quit and difficulty adjusts down, the remaining miners will break even or profit a little.

Coinbase is a btc vendor, you want to be on a proper exchange instead. Theirs is gdax.com and there are a bunch of others. You may think its possible to consistently tell when the price direction will reverse, but it's harder than it looks. You will sell when it's high only for price to go higher. You'll buy in then, right before price takes a downturn. Day traders are rarely successful. Some definitely are.

United States Code
TITLE 18 – CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
PART I – CRIMES
CHAPTER 17 – COINS AND CURRENCY
§ 333. Mutilation of national bank obligations
“Whoever mutilates, cuts, defaces, disfigures, or perforates, or unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, or Federal Reserve bank, or the Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt unfit to be reissued, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.”
So if your stamp broke the bill, such that parts were unreadable, or ATMs couldn't recognize it or counting machines couldn't count it, that would be bad. Otherwise seems safe even if really really unnecessary. Also debatable, factually. At least cash is much more private, for instance. You can keep the $20 as a souvenir - that's fine too.

You have big wallet and small wallet. You move funds to small wallet for spending. Sure it is visible funds came from big wallet but it can't be proven that big wallet is yours. Can say it's an exchange or some other seller you got your coins from.

It's not that blunt. You can avoid the fee by having money come into the account regularly or having a minimum balance. If you open an account, put $5 in it and don't use it again it doesn't mean you're necessarily lacking money. It means you don't need that particular type of account. Close it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:40:38
Average includes transactions that pay barely any fee and sit in queue for weeks. If you pay correct fees the transaction gets into the next block which is about 10 minutes away at any given time. Averages can be misleading. Average American has $300,000 net worth.

Fees depend on network congestion. Right now it's light. For a few months prior there was quite a bit.

Some alts are more tolerated here than others even when it's a bitcoin sub. ETH gets undeservedly more love. What is it? Non immutable non currency centrally controlled buggy platform for issuing other tokens. Cryptokitties and 99% of erc20 junk is hardly useful to society. And bitcoin has colored coins and rootstock which likely can be used somewhat similarly to ETH.

This is how it works in that loan example.
You may be confusing banks with central banks. An average bank is just a small private business providing services. They do NOT magically have money appear, they need to be funded. They either get some amount of funds that bank owner invested, or they borrow from central bank through discount window, or get people to come in and deposit funds into checking and savings. Then they turn around and loan out 90% of the funds at higher rates making profit on the difference. General bank hate is misplaced. They have to comply with a mountain of regulations and squeeze out a profit from percentage points.

You can't switch around between FIFO and LIFO. Once you pick one you have to stick with it forever. Accounting at individual outputs level is probably overkill. Just track prices and dates bought and sold and assume the oldest coins you used to have are always sold/traded first.
There is no guidance from IRS about tracking individual UTXO's and addresses. If you were to start doing it, they might start requiring it. And that's just fucked up. I can tell you how much coin I bought and when, but which address it's in now? Shit, I dunno it's somewhere on HW wallet.

Merchants who used a payment processor to "accept bitcoin" never "accepted" it in the first place.

Hoping there won't be a requirement to report what you hold and in which addresses. If you sell and made profit, sure there's tax on that gain. I am coerced to pay it and unhappily do so. But don't want any bureaucrats keeping tabs on my finances any more than required by law.
Consider XMR and coins that do mixing like dash. BTC can be coinjoin mixed too. There are good reasons to obfuscate your funds outside illegal ones, for privacy. Also consider change addresses. You have 1 btc from 2 years ago. You spend or sell 0.4997 and the other 0.5 goes to change address. Now the 0.5 in change address is brand new and does not get the preferential long term tax rate.

Bitcoin is a digital token. It's not convertible, it's exchangeable. You can't deposit it into a bank account, same as you can't deposit an iphone into bank account. You have to first sell the token/iphone to a willing buyer who will give you currency for it. There is nothing illegal about having an exchangeable token.

I like the camera play. I like your conviction. I like some of your examples. But bitcoin is not money or currency despite whatever names it's being given and the purpose being imposed on it by random parties. If it fails being those things right now -that's OK. It is an immutable ledger not controlled by any central authority. That has value. You can do things with it that are otherwise impossible and we are scratching the surface of what is. What can you buy with bitcoin and nothing else? Ability to write to this distributed immutable ledger, technically. How about peace of mind that value cannot be confiscated from you by flip of a switch at the bank or your stock broker freezing your accounts?
You missed out on $5 bitcoin and now are salty lol. When you start talking about tulips you completely negate your claim that you know what bitcoin is, how it works, how mining issues new coins.

Shorting would require you to have margin on the exchange for when inevitably your short will be squeezed and your position will be liquidated at a loss. You need to use an exchange that offers margin trading for that. Coinbase is kinda like a vending machine, not an exchange. You push a button and your product falls out. Find a proper exchange but reconsider your plans.

To sell bitcoin you would deposit it to an exchange first. When you do that it no longer belongs to you and is no longer in your address and the only way to see how much you have is in the exchange interface. To send from paper wallet you would import or sweep the private key into a mobile or desktop wallet, then send. Then destroy wallet. Once spent it is not reusable.

Solo your 0.000455% will compete with everybody. In a pool that has 30% hashrate you are competing basically with the shared 20% instead of your tiny amount. Do not consider $ price. Only count BTC you can buy or mine right now. If btc price goes up you would have captured the gain either way. Miners have a shelf life. They will eventually mine less in BTC than they cost in electricity. You are not going to retire with these.

Trezor might be looking at bitpay pricing. Maybe there's a way to change it. The most accurate price is whatever you can actually sell your BTC for. Price on BitThumb is $17,251 but you might not be able to trade on a Korean exchange so it's useless to you. You certainly can't sell on coinmarketcap, that's just a price feeds aggregator. Maybe you can sell on GDAX. You definitely can get bitpay price by buying stuff or giftcards from any merchant using bitpay.

First of all, there truly is no cash in my bank account. It is an electronic entry. Any cash I may have deposited is in the drawer or in the vault. Second, you do NOT own the money in your bank account. It becomes property of the bank. They can, and do, take that money and loan it out to other people. What you have is a "promise to repay on request" the money you have deposited with the bank. Most often banks do honor requests to withdraw, but.. some grill you if you take out quite a bit in cash, or deny it outright for "your safety." Some will deny you access to your own money if you wanted to say deposit it into a bitcoin exchange.
Insurance. Coinbase holds a ton of BTC. The insurance description specifically mentions only the BTC hot wallet. Meaning if 23 Billion dollars worth of BTC is swiped from cold wallet via inside job, CB is instantly insolvent and closed. Any funds you have with them may be disbursed to you through court 4 or 5 years later, possibly at pennies on the dollar. So no, I don't trust CB or any exchange for that matter to hold my BTC.

Not your keys not your bitcoin. It depends entirely on when CB would like to release your funds. After that it's about ~10 min to confirm on the bitcoin network. This also depends on the transaction fee paid. As is stated half a million times, it's better to move funds to GDAX and withdraw from there since GDAX pays the mining fees.

If you DCA'd in the last few days you'd get in at a terrible price of 11400, then pick up a dip at 9610 and add on second dip at 9250 your cost basis would be 10086, which is better than going all in at 11400.

Mining algorithm is not changing any time soon, maybe ever. Mining equipment is very efficient and is only getting better. Electricity consumption will rise only if more miners join in. If demand for electricity becomes really high, the price/KWH will rise and some miners will quit, reducing demand. It's a system that balances itself out. There are 100,000 bank branches. Do you call up and ask them about electricity consumption for lighting, equipment, heating/cooling?

Nobody knows how long it will take without any details about your transaction. Where you sent it from or to doesn't matter. Nor how much it was. What matters is the transaction fee in satoshi per byte. Those which pay more get confirmed first.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:26:48
This is inaccurate. Wallets hold keys, never coins. You can take keys from blockchain.info wallet and create an electrum wallet with them. Then it's as easy as right-clicking the transaction in history and picking increase fee option. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:37:33
It is not useful to quote price for units which cannot be spent. That's 546 satoshis dust limit and it's worth about 9 cents. Extending this further, transaction fees are a part of life. 100 sat/byte on average is 0.000226 BTC or $3.80. Any unit below 0.000226 is basically unusable. 0.001 is not a bad one to start with, $16.82.
Cringeworthy when people say "you can buy as low as one satoshi!" No you can't. Many exchanges set a sensible minimum order limit, and if you bought this 1 sat you couldn't move it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:41:19

Yes energy is expended to mine blocks. The fudders extrapolate the energy expenditure dividng it by number of transactions. They also, incorrectly, include the block rewards into cost of transactions as well. So transactions allegedly cost ~$40-$50 dollars.

No. Nothing in bitcoin is encrypted. ECDSA is a signature algorithm, not encryption.


Again no. Encryption implies that decryption is possible. In bitcoin the public key is generated from private key in a one way function. The reverse, getting private key from public, is impossible.

"Low TX's" doesn't make sense. If you meant low fee TX's those transactions don't affect the fees. To skip low you just need to pay low+1 sats/byte. Number of transactions in mempool also makes no difference.
Miners would have to pay high fees with their spam transactions to push fees higher. They will not always be able to mine their own transactions so those fees will be lost to a competitor miner. At some point there is no economical incentive to do this.

You probably mean to say you imported on swept private key. First, you should not use web wallets. Second, if you want to sell send coins to GDAX and sell. You don't need to send them to some other wallet first.

You need a warehouse of miners to solo mine. Your miners will be too slow.
4 miners are 56 TH
Network speed is 12,300,000 TH.
Your proportion is 0.000455285% so you will earn 0.000455285% of daily 1800 BTC reward. 0.00819 BTC per day. ~$116 per day.
As more miners join in your share will decrease and you will earn less and less. Don't forget to subtract 144 KW times your electricity rate per day, ~$14.4 at 10 cents/KW

It sounds like you think you can mine with your PC. You can't. At least not to make money. You need shelves full of dedicated hardware that mines a million times faster than your PC to try and compete mining.

US Marshalls service sold Silk Road coins, pretty much legitimizing bitcoin. Banning math would be silly and unenforceable. Banning onramps would be bad. You're asking would a negative event affect bitcoin negatively. Um, yes. Nobody can predict the future tho.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:12:53
Negative balance - no. All of these will eventually confirm but it's a chain of unconfirmed transactions so if the miner wants the fee from the last one they'd have to include all of the earlier ones including the 16 sat one.

How is it next gen if it's a direct copy of btc with one parameter changed and and actually some newer features removed? Bitcoin transactions are just as fast, they only cost more.

Miners HAVE left to exploit bcash EDA before, and they WILL leave to mine bcash if bitcoin is changed to scrypt of whatever. You are going to have a 12 exahash sha256 coin that nobody can touch regardless of how much it stinks. Did you not see bcash getting more than half of ALL sha256 hashrate? For couple days there bitcoin was vulnerable as fuck.

Import, no. Your private key now could be hell knows where all over your pc or smartphone. Point of ledger is priv keys were NEVER anywhere else other than inside the ledger. You could sweep the key, which would send funds to one of the addresses in the ledger.

Quite a few things are sketchy in this article. Most things mentioned, like trade settlements, identity, insurance claims, voting, IOT, etc don't actually use blockchain yet, nor need to. The 'best' smart contracts on ETH are digital cats.
"Each transaction is a digital ‘block’" - nope.
"Are sender and receiver reputable?" - nope. Sender needs to have priv keys which they could have stolen. Recipient just needs a checksum passing address.
"The blockchain ledger reduces error by encrypting the records." - nope, there is no encryption just signatures and hashes.

Bitcoin not being regulated doesn't mean you can just create some. If you could it wouldn't be worth $6600 or whatever it is now.

I've never seen bitcoin hashrate being lower than some other coin's. That is not something to hand wave away. That was a serious incident. Bcash may not be a threat. Miners leaving is.

You added to confusion by listing amounts in dollars. Roughly, bitcoins are associated to addresses, and each address has a private key for spending from that address. Accounts are a function of your wallet, keeping track of groups of keys. Seeds are a way to generate lots of keys. Your concern seems to be having lots of addresses with some amounts all over the place. You can combine the amounts by sending all at once to new address. Not send many separate to one address, but send ALL at once to one address. Not recommended since fees are high right now.

Yes. Confirmation is having your transaction included in the block. There are energy expenditures external to mining also. For example, PC I'm using to send the transaction and electricity consumption of all nodes which will download and relay my transaction and then download and upload the new block with my transaction. These costs are negligible compared to costs of mining.

This is nonsense. Exchanges are not the ones who buy the coins, it's other traders. 100k btc can be sold at market wiping out the order book with stop loss triggers. This would be bad for many traders but exchanges will be fine and stored BTC would be fine. If you are not buying or selling during that dump doesn't affect you.
You can't lower the price of something 1000x. Lowering it 1x will take it down to zero. WTF?
100k BTC would not destroy the market but it will certainly have an effect. Eventually this seller runs out of coins to sell as hungry buyers gobble up cheap coins.

So for all the millions of customers Coinbase claimed to have at the time, only 14355 made single trades over $20k over 2 year period. Everybody else is small time? This is actually very telling metric. I'm sure things have changed in 2016/2017 as many early adopters likely sold some of their highly highly appreciated coins through CB to cash out.

You wouldn't really be helping. Network has plenty of nodes. You would help yourself though. Node downloads and verifies all transactions from the start. It can tell you the exact state of the network. If you were to rely on some other wallet it could lie to you, I.e display that you received the funds when in fact you have not.

You need to get the private key for each address which had btc prior to fork. You need to empty it out, move BTC to another wallet. Then you import or sweep these same private keys using the clients for alternate chains. The "forked coins" as you refer to them, operate like a completely separate coin, with its own blockchain, its owns clients, and its own ~~losers~~ supporters. Anyway, personally I used electroncash for bcash and coinomi wallet on android for bgold.

It is not necessary to guess. Miners make ~1800 BTC per day. The ratio of individual miner's hashrate to that of the network is their proportion of 1800 daily reward. I.e. if you have 1% of total network hashrate then you make 18 BTC per day. If you have 0.1% you make 1.8 BTC per day and so on.

Good to know. Don't feel so great about the tone of this letter. "Break bitcoin" and "drop support for other formats" and "oblige to upgrade." Segwit was once billed as a soft fork optional feature. If someone didn't want to use it they were free not to. Most users probably make 1 transaction per day or even less frequent so fees is not the concern. Why is this being so strongly pushed as the only way rather than an optional alternative?

If you computer bits are worth more than when you got them you owe tax on the difference. No tax is due until you sell or trade.

Lots of wrongness here.
Mining is guessing a number and hashing it together with some transactions and previous block's hash to make a resulting hash that is below difficulty target. Miners are rewarded with 12.5 BTC per block plus transaction fees. The block reward is a fair distribution mechanism - it pays BTC to whoever has skin in the game. Difficulty increases every 2016 blocks (2 weeks or so) to maintain 10 minute block interval. I.e. if a lot of miners join and blocks are found 9 min apart, difficulty goes up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:22:35
It's for everyone. All miners on the planet regardless how they mine. Block reward now is 12.5 BTC. You contribute hashrate to pool and it pays you proportionally to what you contribute. It pays you out of block reward. You get paid in BTC. Shares is what you give to the pool. Forget solo mining.

Anything can be regulated. Enforcement is a separate issue. No the government can't change block rewards or coin limit, but they can regulate individuals. Onramps like exchanges already are regulated, collecting kyc info whether they want to or not. Mining can be criminalized. Transacting can be criminalized. Possession of hardware wallets can be criminalized. Again, enforcement is a separate issue. "Can't regulate bitcoin" is not accurate though.

For an allegedly smart guy (yeah he did start mcaffee av), who is now 70+ years old and married to his hooker, he only very recently started talking about bitcoin. Nothing before maybe couple years ago. So he's missed out on being an early adopter, most likely. Next, he inexplicably became CEO of some small time company. Convinced them to invest into mining. He needs bitcoin to go through the roof to make sure his mining pays off. And saying stuff doesn't cost him anything. His actual price target may be $98,444.35 but he says $1m to entice people to jump in and pump the price.

What's your goal? Park it for long term or have it accessible for spending? In either case you will need a computer that's somewhat trustworthy. You can boot a linux live ISO to greatly reduce your risks since it loads a read-only kind of environment with everything only in memory. With that you can create a paper wallet for long term (and save an encrypted backup). For secure spending you can get and initialize a hardware wallet (and save an encrypted backup). You can use the hw wallet later on average PC since that's the point of those things.

That's actually kinda cool. There are likely weaknesses if properly dissected.
Focusing on blockchain voting.. Transparency may put off some from voting. Do you want everyone to know how everyone voted? Some people may get hassled and pressured if their vote is for an unpopular person or thing. Oh OK votes are public but you see an ID string without names in blockchain. ID string is mapped to a name in some centralized government database. Hmm OK, why not record votes in same centralized government database? The government can create identities in it at will if they need to fake more votes.
Someone looked at you and verified you and gave you this card. That person apparently has some authority to issue such cards. Why can't they issue 1 real and 1 fake every time? Or issue 1 million fake ones and then later vote with them?
Blockchain provides an immutable record and a timestamp. It does NOT eliminate many other meat space issues with accounting for legitimate votes.

"using 300 machines in a single data centre, Red Belly Blockchain was previously able to achieve 660,000 transactions per second."
That's fast, but.. just go ahead and run it on one AWS instance. The point of having multiple ones is for each to be outside control by a central authority, and ideally be far geographically distributed. Decentralized. There is no point to 300 copies in one datacenter. If you want a backup make 2 or 3 copies. If you want decentralization supported by incentives.. we already have a blockchain based coin for that.

Fiat is not backed by any goods, commodities, minerals, and certainly not gold. It has value because the government says it has value. If you are owed a debt, and you are paid in fiat for that debt, the courts will consider your debt settled, even if you wanted to be paid in something other than fiat.
Miners are rewarded with new coins as a fair coin issuance mechanism. You are welcome to mine and get paid too. However, at this point the investment required for a worthwhile mining setup is extremely expensive. Mining is competitive business on industrial scale, it's not free money.

Not everyone can use every exchange. Perhaps the expensive one is the only option some people have in their country. It is easy to move BTC from exchange to exchange but it's hard to move fiat.

Point is, if you go to github and do a pull request to update something, Wladimir will decline it if his family is kidnapped by the government (I don't know if he has a family, point is - strong pressure is applied.) So how can any dev make changes to bitcoin if no one can get any of them "approved?" So, stale coin. Or someone creates a new github with new commit approvers. You kinda have to trust them and they need to be safe enough to not be forced to do what they don't want.

Electricity generation by burning fossil fuels is what increases CO2. Whether that electricity is used to run btc miners or factories depends on efficiency and cost. Btc miners seem to convert that electricity to profit more efficiently than factories or other uses.
Miners buy electricity like anyone else. If the demand is overheated the utility company can bump up rates by a few % points to cool it. The supply/demand/price chart works for electricity like any other product or commodity.

At this point bitcoin doesn't need any more miners. Ideally existing ones should migrate to renewable energy.
In terms of "country-wide" adoption - bitcoin processes about 500K transactions per day. If half of you guys make a transaction the network will need 3 days to process them, for just you. Have you prepared a realistic response to inevitable question of capacity limitations?

10k mining nodes. Uh no. Those are just nodes, you can't tell if they mine or not. And it doesn't matter. Nodes relay blocks and transactions if they are set up to do so.

Mining must continue indefinitely. Miners will be paid by transaction fees. If this becomes unprofitable for some miners they will quit, network difficulty will adjust down, and remaining miners, the most cost efficient ones, will profit and continue to mine theoretically consuming net less energy.
Lightning network fees are way smaller than $1, less than a penny even. There is no intrinsic value to currencies - they are all measured in terms of something else not "in its own right." Some people will want to hold digital gold and some will use an altcoin for daily purchases.
Comparing costs is a moot point. Centralized systems are cheaper and more efficient but bitcoin offers not just transaction capability but also censorship resistance and financial sovereignty. Like comparing apples to calculators.

Do not put dollar sign in front of btc. It's not dollars. btc, xbt, bitcoin are all the same thing. As any investment, you buy low and sell high to gain profit. People buy and hold due to btc being useful and scarce digital asset. It's like a collectible. It can be sold or traded for goods and services. Price increase is not guaranteed. You get derision because you're asking a repetitive question answer to which has been no doubt covered in links on sidebar. Every newb that comes in and doesn't read available resources cannot be helped personally. There are more new people than people who know what they are talking about in this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:10:25
There would be no delay if you paid the required fee. That fee is 2-3 times higher. Unfortunate, but many people want to send BTC around right now and they ARE paying that much so their transactions go through first.

You can buy some amount of btc. If later price goes up you can sell it for more than you originally paid. That's how most stocks work.
Forget PayPal if you want to deal with btc. Forget cards too. Need something like a checking account to send funds to proper exchange to buy and sell. Also, there are exchange fees to account for when buying and selling.

It's one key for each address. So if you find "a private key" you can spend 50 BTC. The rest of SN's coins will be fine.

Not clear if change is counted. Sending 1 btc from 1000 btc address is sending 1, not 1000.

If you bought in 2013 you'd sell at 900-1000 during late 2013 rally. That's a 10x gain. If you missed the peak you would probably get discouraged in '14 and '15 and sell at 4x or 5x gain. Or play satoshidice a bit too much. Chances are you would NOT still have the coins.

World wide dominating adoption is not the goal. Once this false preconception is dropped you can see bitcoin for what it is. I.e. anyone can make use of it voluntarily, or not.
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:57:45
Double spends are impossible. I hate the term, it's so wrong. Replacing transactions in mempool is not double spending. Having a vendor or exchange credit your account before confirmation is not double spending. Coins are spent only once, all other transactions trying to move same coin will be dropped. Let's also throw in 0-conf. Not a thing, never was a thing. Transaction is either confirmed in a block or it didn't happen.
@_date: 2018-09-08 15:45:32

Well you don't have to stick to bitcoin. There are other viable platforms to do that now. For example, DGB or DASH. What you need to ask yourself is do you really need all those exahashes of security if you just want to send some value from A to B? You don't.

Biggest threat to bitcoin is better technology. A distributed chain of blocks is one way to achieve consensus. New and different ways could be developed.
I roll eyes at suggestion to buy bitcoin and bury it for ten years. In this space bitcoin owners are best to keep themselves appraised of new developments from time to time not sit on their coins blind and deaf. Having said that I don't know if this Radix thing has any merit. Will need to look into.

That's not their business model. Nvidia makes video cards. They reinvest profits into r&amp;d and materials to make better cards. Investing profits into something else is the CEO and the board's decision. Many companies have an investments department which tries to make money from money directly. What to invest in is up to them and it's usually more mature options. BTC or alts certainly don't qualify. Popped up once and now down from the peak. I'd fire an investment department that lost over 50% of the money. You could similarly ask why nvidia doesn't start buying the powerball lottery. Because it's dumb.

Blockchain without addition of proof of work and decentralization is a slow database. Would you be excited if world bank "adopted" databases? That is all that's happening, nothing more. Be nice if you sited what you're referring to so people don't have to go google "world bank blockchain."
Edit: OK maybe referring to bond issue. "When launched, the bond will be both issued and distributed on a blockchain platform operated by the World Bank and CBA.
A private Ethereum-based blockchain is in use for the project as it has the necessary capabilities, but CBA said that it was open to other options in the future as the space develops."

Some accountability for ICOs would be nice. Teams raise millions of dollars and sometimes fail to deliver on the promises or outright abscond with the money. Individual investors are given the impression that there is a "team" and some "advisors" and that the new token may have some actual value. Most tokens don't have value, have no need to exist even, other than to raise money for the "team." Buyer beware applies, but still.

If enough miners leave such that you can mine with a PC then some miner dusting off his farm of S9's can 51% attack the network. Nation States will attack it to destroy any leftover trust in it. Hashrate can NEVER significantly drop from where it is today. You won't ever mine bitcoin with GPU or PC again. If you do it will be worth pennies as it won't be secure enough against double spends.

Supply and demand. Supply is fixed. Demand you speak of is unlimited. When unlimited demand meets fixed supply the price goes up.

No. Blockchain doesn't know when a right hand picks up the gun or the "wrong hand." You would need some sort of magical 3rd party oracle which checks the hands in real time. A "trusted" 3rd party is something you can implement right now without being a blocktard and trying to shove blockchain into everything (it's simply a way to store data in a linked and immutable fashion if said blockchain is also distributed and secured by incentivized proof of work). Once you have a trusted 3rd party requirement you can just go ahead and have them run a centralized relational database which will be cheaper and much more efficient.

Middlemen in transacting. Miners validate transactions and write them into blocks - they are not the middlemen in this context, just a utility.
Mining is intense. You need $9 in investment and operating costs to generate $10 in bitcoin (rough approximation). So miners will not "hold most of the coin" since they have to pay salaries and electricity bill.

sha256 hashrate is expensive. Nobody is going to fuck with that and lose money for an attempt at 51% attack. In contrast, xmr is gpu mined and GPU farms can be bought or forced to attack it.

Separate values work similar to cash. When you exchange a $20 bill for ten and 2 fives your wallet will hold a ten and 2 fives without combining the 3 paper notes together. Still twenty bucks. Just in different format. Can be exchanged for other denominations down the road or combined with more.

Bitcoin does not flow through banks because it has nothing to do with banks. It also does not flow from any computer to any other computer. It's always in the blockchain. Sender unlocks with their private key and relocks it to recipient's key. What changes is the ability to unlock it.

There will never be $20 bitcoin. (Well for a very short time on its way to zero.) Understand the security model. Price and hashrate cannot fall below thresholds. If the coin can be cheaply 51% attacked it will be, by corporations or governments. And insecure coin is worth zero.

Yes, it's easily tradeable, but you need a 3rd party to enforce ownership claims in physical world. If you need to trust someone to mediate you DON'T NEED a token, or blockchain.

Something does not need to be decentralized to be good. In fact most good things are not decentralized. It's more efficient that way.
I remain unconvinced. Some banks are good. They work fine. They are a business and are doing what they do to make a profit. If people abuse their credit or overdraft accounts it's not the banks' fault when punitive fees take effect. Fees are designed to discourage deadbeat behavior.

IRS will take WAY more if you don't report and send what you owe them.
You will need date of sale (date of withdrawal from CB doesn't matter), amount raised at sale, date of purchase and amount paid at purchase time. The difference between amounts is your gain. If date of purchase is over a year ago then tax rate is 15% of gain (could be 20% if your total annual income is high). If bought less than a year ago then the rate is whatever your tax bracket falls into. Best use a tax prep software or agency.
You got LOTS of time before next April to get your ducks in a row, be sure to set aside some funds to pay the tax due, federal, state, and local. Unless you mistyped several extra zeros in your numbers, you could afford $400-500 to pay a pro tax prep agency vs asking on reddit.

Don't be naive. Those are the properties that make gold valuable. The properties that make bitcoin valuable is that it is similarly difficult to obtain or mine and there is a limited amount of both that can ever exist. A medium of exchange needs to have value, otherwise nobody will use it. Both gold and bitcoin have properties which are valued or useful, thus the comparisons between the two.

12 words is not the private key. That's a seed. It is in your phone. Mycelium uses it to generate private keys from it. The seed and keys are accessible to the OS and possibly other apps designed to steal anything that looks like cryptocurrency private keys.
Hardware based keystore like in S10 presumably securely saves seeds and keys blocking access to them by other parts of the phone. It is better than a software wallet (even encrypted ones with a password must decrypt your keys when you send btc), but not as good as standalone hardware wallet.

I heard some grumbling about the cash discounts and minimum purchase amounts for CC. Good to know they are being contested. Maybe there will be a compromise of some sorts. Things will sure change if everything is 4% more expensive when using CC. The points or miles or whatever people get with the cards do not justify that extra cost.
I think Discover and American Express have some of the worst processing costs. Maybe it's time for a legit competitor. And I don't mean Square or Stripe middleman. I mean a low fee processor on the level of mastercard and visa. Behold, the new AmazonGoogBook card from CapitalOne! What's in your bedroom? Err, I mean wallet!

Some of them have friends with the knowledge who might have casually mentioned bitcoin. I have several slacker friends and lots more acquaintances. The slobs, having no bills except a pornhub subscription, and no real concept of investing, go all in blindly.
I assume many people here who rail against dirty fiat the hardest, don't have much fiat and never did. But they do have some BTC and it made them a lot of money fast and easy. Say, hypothetically turning 1k into 100k which is big money for someone who never had 100K to their name.

You have "$0 liability" protection if merchant charges your card incorrectly.
You still have to provide name and address if you buy physical things with btc.
With bitcoin everyone can watch your transactions.
Inflation in bitcoin - let me break this to you softly - there is very little you can do to prevent raising the coin limit. You can whine, not helpful. You can run an unupgraded node, it will be dropped off the network. You can fire up a miner but you are not going to outhash anyone. You can exit, sell your coins, but that's it.

Yeah I understand the motivation. I can rack up a $60-$80 bar tab, more on a weekend. I usually don't carry over $100 in cash with me. So this payment would go on credit. If I'm suddenly being charged more at venue X, even if I like it a lot, I have 6 others within about 5 mile radius. Point is, the merchant should be wrapping his costs of doing his business into product/service pricing. I don't want to see "electricity" line, "cooking oil" line, "napkins" line, and I don't want to see "credit card processing fee" line either.
Having said that, this may be the way things are heading. Maybe applepay and cashapp and others will become actually MORE prevalent payment methods than good old plastic. Cash everywhere is unlikely. Everyone walking with hundreds of dollars? No way. People suck dick for $20. I imagine desperation could push someone to physically attack a stranger for 200 or 300.

Birthright - some joke? That doesn't mean anything. What is that?
Rights - yes, US citizenship comes with rights. You can vote. You can own guns. You can work and live pretty much in any state you like. You can get a free lawyer if arrested. You can own property with reasonably strong assurances that it won't just be taken from you by some guy or government itself. Most of this you can do in other countries with rule of law.
Maybe you're trying to make some patriotism "my country" while beating your chest point. I don't get it. Just because you are born in country X does not obligate you to become an ultra-nationalist of that country. As a human you are free to move wherever.

Bch solved nothing. They kicked a can down the road. With large blocks fees will be low for a long time, even when block rewards dwindle to nothing. Transaction fees must sustain miners or there will be no miners. No miners means no blocks and no transactions. Even today bcash only has ~5% hashrate and btc has 95%. A coin with such low hashrate and existence of so much sha256 equipment is at persistent threat of being 51% attacked. Bcash is unsafe to use!

These links speak to *choices* people made after they were born, not that they were born completely devoid of capacities and capabilities to become more. Women are born with similar science and math capacity as men, but they *choose* to not pursue such fields for various reasons. I certainly covered that by addressing the environment in which people are born into and what options they have socioeconomically.
To be sure you don't misunderstand my point again - everyone is born with about the same capacity for success in life (absent disabilities and health issues), **but** not necessarily in the conducive environment or with all available options. At no point did I say that everybody is born with same options, same access to resources, and same nurturing environment that would keep a growing child engaged and free to pick a career or activity of choice without societal pressures.

More pressingly, Fidelity has an investment arm that buys IPOs then ads the ipo stock to their etfs later for plebs to buy at inflated prices netting fidelity investment desk 10x to 1000x gains.

Hypothetically there are many limitations. It is possible to hide your stash and leave. The issue may arise when you try to sell 2 billion worth of coins. That is hard. Would take some time trickle selling. And selling is where you are linked to the funds. If it can be shown you owned the asset before you left, the gain on that asset is taxable (I think). While you're out of the country you are probably OK. But once you set foot in US, there  will be problems for you. If the gov believes you owe them a billion dollars they will spend 1.99 billion going after you. Returning without some sort of legit cover for how you made your money outside the country is probably not a good idea.

There was a post about it and it's rather difficult according to them to make sure compatibility is kept with the existing stuff so users don't lose funds. Or something like that. The wallet has features others don't, like built in trader thing.

Mining is done for profit not out of some ideals. Profit motive wins out. Game theory and all that.
And profit is income minus expenses. Expenses are lower with stable grid energy vs renewable.
Next, what other paying customer would you ban? How about churches? They are welcome to open, freedom of religion and all that, but they can't be on the grid. Run a generator. How about a ban on bars? Patrons need to pedal at the bar to keep their personal light on. Banning one thing can lead to slippery slope.

There may be an effort to keep market cap above 100 billon. As much as that metric is useless for cryptocurrencies, in traditional markets 100B is often the minimum size asset for some big funds to invest in. They cannot be bothered with tiny 10B small caps since liquidity is often just not there. So that may explain why support is being protected. Resistance is chumps who came in around last year and want to exit at par or minor loss. And also early adopters who have 1000's of coins and need a 3rd lambo.

No. Because it literately does not solve many of the issues with counting legitimate votes. It's a non-editable timestamping system. So what? You still have to verify each voter, issue keys, make sure they are not stolen, sold, misused, etc. The agency issuing keys can easily issue 5 million more "Republican" keys and you can't do anything about that. What good are accurately recorded votes if they are fake to begin with? If you trust central government to issue voting keys you might as well trust them to record the votes, and they DON'T NEED a blockchain for that. A database will work much better.

Think of bitcoin as an object, let's say a couch. For a couch to go up 10x in price it has to be one hell of a couch, but fine, maybe it does. Can you redeem a couch for a visa? No you can't. You must sell it to someone who wants it. Then your can take the money and move it to any of your accounts, with visa card or not, savings, whatever. You can't just take the couch to the bank. And you can't just shove bitcoins into a bank. You have to sell them first. (Nice thing about bitcoins they are all uniform and have same value, unlike couches which can differ in value from one to another.) Or you can pay for something with bitcoin directly on whatever website or merchant accepts it.

Technically the spending keys are what of stored, not bitcoins. USB sticks is not a secure method since they fail and any computer they are plugged into can read them and infect them.
There must be a way to track where you bought and for how much since everything is time-stamped. A lot of hoop jumping is required to cash in later. The problem is not with holding coins but with suddenly having unexplained money in the bank. That shit sets off red flags.

Pretty good definition of blockchain here 
Bitcoin's blockchain is more complex. When someone says blockchain they need to clarify which one. It's like saying integrated circuit - well it could be in simple switch or in an iphone and there's a big difference. Saying "bitcoin blockchain" automatically means it has several other features, like being distributed (generic blockchains don't have to be), using proof of work for updates (generic blockchains can be updated by one guy), and so on. Saying "ETH blockchain" automatically means it also has some features, like being unscalable, being generally useless, being non-immutable (theDAO), centrally controlled, etc.

Forget PayPal completely when dealing with bitcoin.
Coinbase will give you a price point in time. Quite a bit lower than market rate probably. You can use a proper exchange to set your own price and sell only if someone is willing to pay it. Good exchange fees are less than 1%.
You cannot redeem bitcoins for anything unless someone on the other end of the trade wants to trade. Amazon doesn't take bitcoins for amazon gift cards, but some people might. You may get fake gift card code that way. I did. Amazon verified the code as good then a month later pulled it. Bye bye $50.
Visa is a payment processor. It doesn't issue any cards. Banks issue cards. Banks do not work with bitcoins only with dollars. So a Visa can only be loaded with dollars. There are some services that offer bitcoin cards but all they do is sell coins and load dollars for you. Shiftcard and also bitpay has one I think. Useless in my opinion, too much tax calculation hassle for every transaction.
You can try buying a vanilla visa card on egifter. There are low limits and high fees though so I have not tried.

B) fake news going around that binance is delisting tether.

Brain addresses rather than wallets. An address generated from your own passphrase. Many people think they are clever when selecting something like "to be or not to be" but that's easy for enterprising individuals to check for. In fact it's likely that published works, song lyrics, and memorable quotes are all being scanned and taken if anyone uses them. Many people will just go with a knee jerk reaction saying brain wallets are unsafe. They are safe if passphrase is good. I used them for a lot of coins and never had an issue.

Let's say I'm in no position to drop 50k on an electric car that can do ~300 miles on a charge. But I got the wherewithal to rent one for a day.

Someone buying at 10k may not want to cash out until 10k+. A kind of a floor price for a small piece of supply, if you will. Someone buying at 19k may hold until 19k+. Same for 25k and so on.
When you buy something with bitcoin you cash out. So it has almost the same effect on price as straight selling - increased supply. Most companies don't accept bitcoin, they accept fiat via a payment processor.

Read more about securely storing keys. Visit bitcoin.org (not .com) and see list of recommended wallets for your phone and PC. (If you run windows don't use a PC wallet). Sign up on 1 or 2 big exchanges and link your bank account. Buy maybe $50 worth and practice sending it to your phone wallet, send couple bux as donation to whatever org or project you like. Delete your phone wallet with couple bux in it and restore it from scratch with a backup you properly made earlier with seed words. Seed words or private keys in a text file in your computer are as good as gone, they must not be saved in clear text on internet connected device. Take personal responsibility for securing your digital funds as your good security practices will ensure their safety. Make no assumptions about value appreciation. That is not guaranteed.

GBTC was new and first. It charges 2% per year (many passive ETFs are under 0.1%, some I own charge 0.3%) which is ridiculous. And draconian premium. 0.00099395 btc per share it should cost $6.38 not $7.29. So basically it sucks compared to a competing ETF if those come out.

There are some cases where IRS oversteps, takes funds directly from pay or accounts, etc. But that's an issue with authority granted to them. If you don't like this authority complain to your congress persons to change the law.

Getting into options to cover the trade is an example. Manipulation is so overused and given bad name. Every single trade is a price manipulation. Most trades just aren't large enough. Every one though is having an effect on the order book. Stop hunting is fine if trader assumes risk.

Altcoins? Perhaps there are quick turnaround plays to be made but long term I'm not so sure. Recently stuff coming out is ICO junk on ETH. Setting up a new ETH node and syncing its terabyte blockchain is no small feat requiring patience and restarts and weeks of time. Having to pay ETH toll (gas) to move any ETH token is bullshit too. And the crown jewel is that tweet saying "stop deploying dapps to ETH, it's at capacity." Lol so much fucking lol - NOTHING usable runs on ETH and it's already at capacity.

It's hard to tell what bitcoin was created for. There are speculations and interpretations. Clearly on-chain doesn't work for any appreciable volume so no it can't be "digital cash for everyone." That's just basic math. Lightning works but I have concerns. What if scenario is mempools are stuffed and very connected node goes down for days. Everyone with channels need to force close them right? Well they do, their close transaction drops into fat mempool and sits there for 3 days. That's not good for the channel right?

Hardware wallets are excellent but expensive. Not needed for $5. Wallets hold keys, never coins. Wallets don't need login or email.

People don't collect things that are abundant. Like sand. People collect things that are pretty, unique, or scarce. Bitcoin is highly collectible because there are relatively few of them to ever exist.
Token is a better term than many others. Bitcoins are not coins, and in common practice are not money or currency. They are entries in a distributed ledger, which can be represented as a digital token, and can be used as a form of money. Being highly collectible and easily transferable the tokens function well enough as medium of exchange.

There is no opportunity. You can deposit and sell btc but can't withdraw fiat from bitfinex. They have banking issues on and off. People waiting for pending withdrawals for weeks. If you can't remove fiat you have to buy coins at any price and withdraw them.
And withdraw everything you should. Bitfinex is likely insolvent. The risk is too high. Tether fiasco has been called fraud to death. Bitfinex cold wallet has been shrinking as people flee. If it is running fractional reserve it may eventually implode. US persons can't use bitfinex. If someone from US is using it they likely will have major legal issues claiming their funds in bankruptcy since they were prohibited in the first place.

Gold's usage today is rather low. Electronics - small amounts. Jewelry - quite a bit but it's hardly a necessity; most chains and rings likely sit in a box rather than being worn daily. Coins and bars - sitting in some vaults somewhere. Its usage as money was bigger at some point than today, precisely because it was scarce, hard to duplicate, and it lasted a long long time being non-reactive. The powers that be replaced gold-as-money with paper money and bank accounts. Partially for ease of use (it's not easy to split or combine chunks of gold for an average person) but mostly for control and financial surveillance.
Bitcoin also became valuable because of its usage. If it was easy to duplicate, easy to confiscate, and hard to store and transfer, then it would not be worth much. Its scarcity and utility is at least partially responsible for its valuation with the rest being hype, hopes and dreams, and speculative trading.

Take a closer look at mining. It's not as glamorous as it may seem. A relatively small number controls issuance of new coins. They can do funny things like stuff blocks and sensor transactions. And in theory you can have a voice to, just mine yourself.. But in practice you can't do shit. You don't have the scale. You're in control of nothing and at miners' whim.

Price is a function of supply and demand. Demand has many things that go into it, sentiment, etc. Lines on charts don't mean shit. Cat is out of the bag. Crypto (god I fucking hate this word being stolen - it means cryptography) is on TV and social media. Attention has increased dramatically and space continues to improve in terms of usability and acceptance. Things are not like they were at any other time in the past. Random news events will continue to have an effect (people act on news believing that others will act on news, it's a self fulfilling prophecy). EOY price point? Nobody knows.

On the sell side we have the lucky fucks who got in for pennies and are dumping their bags and living large, and of course 1800 btc per day that miners get. The sellers can only sell once and that gives me comfort. 21 million coins is not many. Every newcomer who buys and holds 0.1 btc takes it off "available for sale" side.

The treasury prints notes not the bankers. Banks are in business of making interest on deposits. Highly regulated and risky business as not all loans are repaid in full. Loans are generally good for consumers to afford large purchases and for businesses to invest in expansion
Nobody gets free cash. Borrowed money needs to be repaid. If you don't need a loan don't borrow money and you will not be indebted to the bank. You're implying banks conscript your time and labor. They do not.

Once gold is dug up the costs of storing or moving it are not zero but still relatively low. With bitcoin that is not the case. To "move" it mining must continue indefinitely and we are all currently paying 1800 BTC ($11.62 million dollars) per day to miners to stick around and maintain the capability to make secure transactions. I mention secure on purpose. Bitcoin cannot survive at significantly lower hashrates since it will be susceptible to 51&amp; attacks.

Send BTC to new address first. Any address in electrum is good. Export keys for all old addresses from MB. Sweep them into electroncash (bcash wallet). Send to exchange. BTC should be in an address protected by a key which you have not entered into electroncash client.

BTC gold snapshot already happened. If you didn't have the keys then it's too late. Wallet does not matter if you can access keys directly. You can with Core, you can with Electrum, and several others. You can use the keys to claim your coins on alternate forks. If coins are on deposit with some service that doesn't give you the keys then you're at their whim.

Exchanges may make it easier on you. If you control your own keys you can't "protect" yourself after the fork by trading because anytime you send BTC on the network it may get replayed. You'd need to split away the altcoin first. If you are already on the exchange all trades are off chain.

Money does't go INTO bitcoin. Originally it was paid to miners because they are the ones who get the block subsidy. Then miners give the money to their electricity provider. Lately with trading it's one person buying BTC from another person. Money doesn't go INTO bitcoin it goes into seller's pocket. Seller then buys lambo.

If you want to own some to play with it, try creating wallets, sending transactions, learn how fees work, yes. Then maybe get a bit more and own basically universally recognized value that cannot be frozen or confiscated from you (if secured properly).

Backup phrase. You are missing that. Wallets give you that. If you save it securely somewhere outside your home it doesn't matter what happens to your phone or PC or the wallet maker. You can restore access to your funds from the backup.
Storing your funds with a third party is risky since they are mostly uninsured and if they screw up you lose everything. In some cases it is better, i.e. if you're still running Windows XP and don't know anything about basic security.
Your hardware wallet mention in title - hardware wallets allow for secure storage AND spending. Transactions are signed on the device, not the PC you connect it to to. It is a huge step up from having a software wallet on your PC. But, again, it needs to be initialized securely and if you write down the backup phrase in text file on the PC you defeated the purpose of the hardware wallet. Many people make that mistake.

Communism and socialism do not eliminate the need for industrial mining, chemicals, pollution, and raising cattle for food. In many ways these things are even more damaging. On a farm someone else owns, nobody gives a shit about waste, or increasing output, or pretty much anything. Capitalist owner would find ways save more and profit more, maybe make their products better to sell more of it. Communist worker would show up to government owned farm, put in their hours, and leave. If something is broken or leaking they don't care. If they were to fix it or improve it they get no benefit out of it, so they don't. Shit just stagnates.

"Blockchain technology" is not some magic. It's like 20 year old parts combined together.

There are mining calculators you can google for. Your chances of getting a block are pretty low. You will likely mine into a pool, rather than by yourself, and get paid proportional to how much hashrate you contribute. It is not possible to predict the future price or difficulty. Both have gone up, historically, however, difficulty going up means your miners produce less and less until eventually your electricity cost to run them is higher than the BTC earned.

Has little to do with "money being lost." Transaction fees are not lost money, they are incentives for miners to not ignore your transaction. Change addresses have nothing to do with fees. Many good wallets create change addresses automatically without you needing to worry about that.

Seems a little counterintuitive since that's twice the maintenance, twice the registration/tag fees, twice the insurance payments (I'm sure these are lower for the toytas vs luxury cars but still). A reasonably priced 2-3 year old bmw or lexus can be a good daily driver without paying for second car. Maybe it's just me, I have not found a need to own multiple cars and the one I have offers all the bells and whistles without porsche-like maintenance costs.

Remittance is just one specific use case. Most transactions that people have are paying for housing, transportation, utilities, food, entertainment, and discretionary shopping.

Best of luck to them of course. But they've chosen a monitization option that is predominantly all scams so I remain unconvinced.

Would be cool to have a $4000 GPU rig back then. If you mined fast the difficulty would rise too fast. Ideally you just mine 49% of all blocks making sure blocks are still coming 10 min apart so you could milk the most possible reward over time without looking like you're attacking the network.

Don't store in clear text, encrypt. Have a backup outside your place of residence. When spending coins use a linux live CD to access your flash drive. Flash drives are OK except for a few situations. They do not last forever and may lose data, so backups are essential. It's no longer cold storage once you plug it into any computer. Every time you try to spend BTC you will be exposing everything to the PC you're using. Hardware wallets are great for spending since the keys are never accessible to the PC unlike with USB stick.

Mobile is not necessarily "more secure." It depends on how you use it, how careful you are installing apps, etc. As I said wallets store keys, coins are always in the blockchain ledger. If you are good with electrum stay with it. Mobile is nice for spending. You can easily scan QR codes with it. Mobile is like your dead cow skin wallet.

All inputs are separate even if they are in the same address. They all require signatures to spend which takes up space, and space costs fees. You can send it all at once but you will have to pay the fee for the cumulative data size of the transaction. Right now fees are really high.

No. If you send less than 0.1999 it would likely send it from the 0.2 address. If you needed to send say 5BTC it would send it from the 100BTC address. If you wanted to send 100.1 or all of it, the wallet would combine them. I don't know if trezor does multiple change addresses or not. Electrum can.

None. Both store keys. There is a difference between legacy and segwit addresses. Legacy start with 1 (or 3 for multisig), segwit start with 3 (or bc1 for bech32). Transactions sent from segwit addresses cost less in tx fees because signature data size is not counted the same as it is in transaction with legacy sending address.

Nobody buys 100k bitcoins at a time with coinbase. There are limits per account. Also, someone is buying and someone is always selling. Coinbase will have enough to cover demand at the price. If demand becomes very very high the price will jump up cooling demand immediately and coinbase will get more coins out of cold storage.
They already have the coins they sell to you. Yes they make money on volume on transaction fees. It almost doesn't matter at what price the coin trades as long as it keeps trading.

You can track first in first out, or last in first out. Either method is fine as long as you pick one and stay consistent with it forever. First in first out is probably more traditional. $500 would be cost basis. $7200 sale price. You'd have $6700 gain and, if bought over a year ago, long term cap gains tax rate of 20% on that 6700.

Trading is off chain, so forks do not affect trading unless exchanges chose to suspend it. They may suspend deposits and withdrawals. Dip is not guaranteed. Pump is not guaranteed. You are taking a risk with any move. It may pay off, or it may not. Hold BTC in a proper wallet. You can buy the dip if you have funds on the exchange. And you can claim the shitcoin later and sell it.

Not the number of miners but hashrate. Additional miners tend to increase hashrate. At certain network hashrate, guessing the nonce at petahashes per second, and with certain difficulty and target set, it should take 600 seconds worth of hashes to find a block. Which miner finds it is random. But in practice larger miners with higher proportion of hashrate find more blocks than smaller ones, proportionally.

Technically yes. The exchange is supposed to calculate gains and send forms to you and IRS. If they don't send one to you they likely didn't send one to IRS. However, IRS could ask for records in bulk like they did with Coinbase.

1k is a bit of an over-exaggeration. You can make money off volatility, many traders do. No it's not advisable, you will lose money. Trade on an exchange. Maybe bitmex with leverage. Do not touch USDT. Don't come near it.

It is if you owned the coin for 1+ years. It is taxed at your standard tax bracket rate if owned for less than a year. Any time BTC leaves your possession, for any reason (might be some quirks where you can gift it with the tax liability), you need to calculate what your gain was and apply % tax (cap for year+ or income bracket if held less than a year).

Absolutely. Model S is likely a fantastic car and properly warmed up it will beat a lambo from 0 to 60 in ludicrous mode. It is of course not without its own weird quirks and range anxiety and all that.
What irks me the most is zero emissions lie. It's charged with electricity which is produced by burning coal or natural gas. There are emissions Tesla. Don't hide that shit. Even hydro power requires people to run it and those people get to work in cars and trucks burning gasoline. There was some math online Teslas basically produce 1/5 the amount of emissions a gasoline sedan does.

Different exchanges do in fact have different prices. Gemini - $9455. CEX - $9713. Some enterprising traders may take advantage of the price differences and arbitrage them equalizing prices. It is not easy to move funds between exchanges, especially ones in different countries so the equalization isn't instant.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:44:32
Heavy selling will drop the price. CB has a large enough fund to keep buying up BTC from customers and as price goes lower and lower they will pay less and less for each additional coin. At some point price will be too low for some people to sell so they will not even attempt.

The whole b2x fork is one big shitshow. They do want to be a replacement but look, it's based on older version of bitcoin with some unpatched bugs, it is not accepted by anyone for anything, it is ridiculously contentious, and it has one (1) dev vs couple hundred contributors to btc. Yes miners are saying they will mine it, but why mine a coin nobody wants? They will keep paying for electricity but get paid way way less. Also look at supply and demand. Zero demand and all BTC holders are airdropped this free supply. Many large holder publicly stated they will dump. As more and more people dump this $1000 price won't last.

Decentralization and censorship resistance are primary concerns. Transaction fees are not. Throughput and scaling are not. Roger's fucking coffee is not. Cheap to transact bitcoin which can be knocked out is not interesting. Fees are too low. It should cost more to save some unchangeable data forever.

Economic activity in layer 2 can be bundled up and stamped into BTC blockchain.

Coinbase knows you, and every address associated with your account, and every bank account you withdrew to.
As an example you deposit 1 BTC today. Sell it for $7200. Move funds to your bank checking account. This is all clearly visible to IRS agent. They will want to know how much you bought this coin for. It is YOUR responsibility to prove you bought it for $7000. Your taxable gain is $200 and tax rate is lets say 28% or whatever bracket it falls into ~$56 bucks.
If you cannot prove you bought it for $7000, they will assign cost basis of zero. Your taxable gain is full $7200 and you are on the hook for $2000+. It is in your best interest to have decent records, report every sale that hits your bank, and pay the tax. IRS has unlimited capacity to ruin your day, or a year, or your whole life.
Law of diminishing returns applies. If it takes them $10,000 to investigate your underpaying of $500 bucks in taxes they are not going to do it. IRS request to Coinbase was asking about trades over $20,000 which is no panacea for smaller traders, but at least for now they are not being investigated.

The transactions will show up on your bank statement or online on your bank's website, not in your email. Point is if I got your card number you wouldn't want ME to buy a bunch of BTC with it, would you? They are checking if it's really your card.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:45:15
You are required to report your gains. It is not a trick. You can check IRS website for very broad guidance. There is no fluff or frills: it's taxed as an asset. Exchanges do not send you a tax form, so they are not sending one to IRS. This may change in the future. And of course IRS can demand records from all exchanges like they are doing with coinbase.
If you're on a coin exchange which only has your email address and no identifying info, and you're a small time trader, you're likely not going to become a target. If you're on coinbase, gemini, kraken, all these exchanges that collect identifying details, and you sell and move fiat to a bank account you can bet your ass that transaction is a taxable event.

Meh, you run open source software program and it downloads a copy of publicly available data.
1. It's happening. Bunch of s2x nodes are up. Once the magic block is reached AND miners mine s2x chain, 100%.
2. Miners can chose to not mine segwit2x blocks. They can do this up to the last minute before magic block. Hell, they can mine the chain for a while then quit minutes or years later abandoning the whole thing and killing segwit2x.
3. Not sure what you're asking. Segwit is a transaction type. It's already locked in and available. There is no edge with segwit. It seems to be working fine. For segwit2x Barry Silbert, Jeff Garzik, and a few big miners could call off NYA/segwit2x. BTC would probably hit $9k by weekend as everyone breathes out a sigh of relief.

It is not a scam but it does have almost no customer support. They do close accounts for people using it as a wallet and sending/receiving funds from questionable places. Coinbase works great for everyone, until it doesn't. It is easier to use for newbs because it's a vending site, not an exchange. Skip coinbase and avoid their high fees.

Perhaps calculations include block rewards into the cost of transactions which is misleading. Block reward is a bootstrapping and fair coin issuance mechanism. As this reward trends to zero, a portion of equipment will be taken offline reducing energy expenditures.
Why is it worth it now? Well.. I am not well versed on intricacies of psychology. What I do know, is over all of human history, when people met, their priority was how do I kill this other mofo and take their stuff. Humanity has not known a single generation without war. Even today conflicts rage somewhere on the planet, and not with sticks and stones but automatic weapons, car bombs, and cruise missiles.
So principle of trust is likely not inherently human but a social invention, to reduce suffering and enable growth and progress. Deals have contracts and contracts are enforced by a system of courts.
To wrap this up, governments and corporations do not work on trust. Bitcoin network, with all its faults, does not require it and that has enormous implications.

"the reason we get charged for that overdraft" is to discourage spending money you don't have. It's not the bank's fault you don't have enough money. Earn more or track your spending better. 
"3 times as much per coin as an ounce of gold. And we are only just beginning." Conjecture. We could be at peak of the bubble right here.
"By then, we the people will have recaptured the horde of gold that belongs to the people." I don't get this. Gold doesn't just belong to the people. It belong to whoever paid for it, with money, earned from work. Nobody is owed anything just for existing.
"hearing about Bitcoin in 2012. I was late to the party" 2012 was certainly not late to the party. "It had just exploded in value to about $1100 and crashed to around $200, so I watched" This happened a year later, not in 2012.
Too much focus on price rising and making profits. That's not the main point of getting into BTC, but is a fantastic side benefit.
"Since the beginning of the human story" this paragraph seems to rehash the whining about the banks and 1%ers that was already covered earlier.

Mining difficulty adjusts as more and more miners join in. Everyone mining can only get 1800 BTC per day. You will get a slice of that proportional to your hashrate. With a 10-12 exahash network your proportion on a PC or even a standalone miner like S9 will be tiny. More people join mining and your share is tinier still. Diminishing returns unless you keep adding mining equipment to your warehouse of miners powered by cheap hydroelectricity from river nearby.

Yeah, it's fine. I mean there is no risk to your BTC. Of course if you are interested in a 100BTC address, and blockchain.info knows that, and they have your IP, and they give IP to the government on request.. now government knows which addresses you care about enough to look up. Minor privacy issue for an edge case. Not really something to worry about.
For 100 BTC I would suggest splitting into smaller amounts than 33, into more addresses than 3, and with different values each. Like 20-25 with between 2.565433 and 6.26611555 in each. Then as you pay for stuff over time, the amounts come out of these smaller addresses individually without others getting involved.

Roger is not short of ways to pay for his coffee. He can use dash, digibyte, dogecoin, litecoin, Credit Card, fiat, etc. Bitcoin is sometimes called gold 2.0 (not to be confused with bitcoin gold altcoin). Gold eagles and 1oz gold bars are not used to pay in retail and they are still very popular.
Bitcoin needed "adoption" to get out of its sub $1 phase, and to overcome "drug money" taint. Now it has outgrown (very quickly) retail and basic purchasing. Its success paved the way for lots and lots of new coins and experimenting. It is not improbable that a blockchain based cryptocurrency will be used in retail/online and it will be pegged somehow to bitcoin for ultimate in security. I do not expect to buy coffee with gold coins, nor with bitcoin. That's just my view and I may be wrong.

You came to the block space store. You said I want 420 bytes of space. The store clerk said, well some people are paying 120 sats per byte or more right now. And you are like, eh, how about 101 sats per byte? Store clerk is like, of course, please step into the waiting room over here with the other 60,000. When nobody else wants to pay more than 101 sats/byte we'll happily sell you 420 bytes of block space for 101 per byte.

Inputs cost more than outputs. Inputs are stored individually. Sending from 1 address with 10 inputs is the same as sending from 10 addresses.
Privacy implications. Once address is linked to you it's easy to know what all you did without digging very far. Spending from an address reveals public key (not xpub) which would make calculating private key easier with quantum comps (don't exist yet).
Not xpub, the public key. Yeah any transaction is spending.

Well coinomi is a wallet. It lets you control your private keys and send/receive various coins. Coinbase is a btc vendor. They buy and sell directly to consumers. They control keys. At any point in time they can deny access to everyone's funds, or just your funds. MtGox was an exchange facilitating trades between traders. It ran a fraudulent bot buying up BTC the exchange has lost and was trying to quietly replace.

EDA is a major bug and great that it's getting patched. I'm talking about other things bcash copied from core that aren't in the whitepaper. Why is bcash not based on v0.1? Why is it not CPU mined? Why does it have p2pkh and p2sh? Why are you willfully ignoring this statement from the whitepaper and calling a chain with less proof-of-work bitcoin? **"The majority 
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it."** Why are you OK with majority of sha256 hashrate not mining bcash? It's clearly at risk of successful 51% attack at all times making it non-viable for finance. If you're going to leverage whitepaper as an argument please make your coin adhere to it. Otherwise find a new argument. Enough with the whitepaper ffs.

Wallets hold keys, not coins. Got that? Nothing is credited or shifted anywhere. A fork event creates an incompatible copy of BTC chain, BUT, your BTC keys can spend coins on both chains once. After that different keys and addresses are in play, and s2x coin is as different from BTC as litecoin is different from dogecoin.

It's a copy of bitcoin so it's the same technology. Scaling implies going from 3 transactions per second to 3000+ not 55 that bcash can do. Once they hit that throughput (unlikely) they will be in the same position where bitcoin is now with network congestion and expensive fees. And unlike bitcoin they have no devs and no plans to scale anywhere beyond that. Bitcoin has actual legit plans to scale, not to kick the can down the road.

You want to mine $20K per b2x block or $93k per BTC block? Granted, because of difficulty adjustments b2x blocks could be mined faster but that means b2x coins appear faster and miners will sell them faster dropping b2x price lower and lower.

Do not pick your own seed words. That is not random enough. It is best to erase and initialize the device on a secure computer. In most cases booting from a linux live CD of some sort would suffice. Wired keyboard, not wireless. Networking disabled. Seed words written down, or put into keepass and encrypted.

You need to be signed up for both exchanges and have the funds to buy on Gemini, and be awake to time something like this. Right now I see it, 11173-10671 or about $500 difference.

Look at bottom chart. Look at the top 1000KB. That's going to fit into a block. If you're within that top you will get fast confirmation. If time is not as important set fees way lower but don't set it to 5 sats per byte when there are 40 megs of them in the queue.

Bcash is an altcoin. You'd have to research it elsewhere. The difference is you do not own bitcoin if coinbase is holding it for you. You have to ask them every time for permission to use it.

Why would it go up? Bitcoin price is not guaranteed to go up. But yes, price of bitcoin units is market price regardless of which wallet you are using.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:18:54
Yes. It is not bad if it's just your BTC and you're using it. It would be bad if let's say you had consolidated 10 addresses with 10 BTC each and sent it all to one address. Now it's clear you own 100 BTC when you try to spend some BTC from it. That is a lot of money! Keeping the 10 addresses separate would not let anyone know you own 100 bitcoins.
Number of inputs and outputs affects data size and thus fees. Inputs need to be signed, signatures are big, so they cost more.
You generally don't need to worry about how much BTC is which address in your wallet. The wallet will manage the addresses for you. It will combine inputs when needed and, if you set Electrum to use multiple change addresses, it will split out larger balances into smaller ones automatically. The downside is if you ever want to consolidate your entire wallet the fee will be quite high to combine all the tiny inputs. It is possible to do this cheaply if you can time it for when transaction queue on the network is low.

A chunk of hashpower left to mine bcash. There are about a dozen other sha256 altcoins too. An exahash is devoted to something called crowns and .76 exashes are mining unobtanium. Perhaps newer or smaller miners think their equipment will serve them better this way and leave to mine another coin.

Shitcoin will be associated with your BTC private keys regardless of where you hold them. It will be more difficult to claim it yourself. If you want convenience go with coinbase. Can't really expect wallets to program in an option for something that is hostile and might not even happen.

Price of each coin will be set by traders according to supply and demand. Since BTC owners get the new coin for free there will be no demand for it and lots of available supply that just showed up. If you don't know the implications of this basic principle in economics google "supply and demand graph."

You are talking about bitcoin's blockchain not blockchains in general. With right incentives bitcoin blockchain is a highly tamper resistant data store. Digital IDs - if I take your private key under threat of imminent harm and can easily prove that I am you, am I really you? You still need third parties to recognize identities. Proving that you hold a private key for a specific public key only proves that you have the privkey.

We don't know the date, we know the block number. That's just math formula, keep halving the reward every 210k blocks. Mining difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks to keep blocks ~10 min apart. Lots of miners showing up quickly will make blocks be found faster so difficulty will rise. Lots of miners dropping would make block interval longer, so difficulty would drop lower. For almost all of bitcoin's history hashrate has been increasing and difficulty rising, so far.

When iphone was invented it didn't have copy/paste option. Many people are sure glad that Apple continued to improve the device rather than sticking to the "original vision" of almighty saint Jony Ive. Did other manufacturers all circlejerk around the iphone whitepaper? No, they made better devices with bigger batteries, with microSD card slots, with better screens, faster processors and sometimes all that for less money.

Only you will know the recovery seed phrase. It's better because YOU control the funds. Right now coinbase does and they can tell you to go pee in the wind when you ask for your money.
Recovery seed phrase can be used outside of trezor to recover keys. It uses standardized key derivation. You need to have it securely backed up. If you do, trezor going of business, or you losing or breaking it does not prevent you from accessing the funds.
bip32 or bip39 tool. It's just javascript that runs in any browser.
You could copy paste the wrong receiving address. You could copy correct address but paste wrong one if your PC is infected with address replacer malware. If we go meta you could initialize your trezor on insecure device and then store your recovery seed words in .txt file on desktop defeating the entire purpose of the trezor.
Transactions are signed on chip in trezor. Keys are never exposed to the PC. With flash drive keys will be exposed and stolen if PC is infected.
Do a little bit more reading. You have plenty of time. I suppose you could buy a trezor now but you should preorder the trezor T new model which doesn't ship for a few weeks.

Stop orders are risky because they will sell at best price you can get. If it drops really fast you might get it filled way low. These are good if you have to exit a position no matter what. Sometimes that's better. Let's say your stop sell is at 6700. Price tanks. Your sell triggers and as orders fill in order they were put in you end up selling some at 6650 and most sells at 6400. Sucks, yeah? But price keeps dropping to 4000. Aren't you glad now? If you had a stop limit then your order would be stuck at your limit.

Value doesn't depend on just mining. Value could plummet based off other factors, whether more miners join in or fewer. Other than miners nobody else is thinking about electricity. The assumption about electricity consumption is that those costs will be balanced out. Most efficient miners will survive and profit, some may break even and close reducing net electricity consumption. Have you googled bitcoin farm and seen rows and rows of s9's? Those are fast ass computers. They are pretty dumb doing just one thing but doing it very fast.

Yeah, every time BTC leaves your possession for anything, fiat, another coin, product or service, gain has to be calculated and tax accounted for. Gains on short term trades, on asset held for less than a year, are taxed at income tax bracket rate rather than the 20% capital gains tax rate. Having said that, it's kind of ridiculous. I suppose averaging out the cost basis and sale prices would be seen as reasonable but don't know. I've paid taxes on BTC gains once before and it was relatively easy with just a few buys and sells. Day traders might have to show some sort of convincing accounting. There is also enforcement cost to consider. If an IRS agent spends $1000 of their time (salary, office space rent, benefits, etc.) to do research on you to eventually collect $200 of underreported tax, that's not a good proposition for anybody.

It takes some work to mine a block. When it is mined it has a difficulty value, how hard it was to mine it basically. The sum of all difficulties of all blocks in the chain is the total difficulty of that chain. Even though bcash has more blocks, bitcoin's chain has much higher total difficulty. Efficiency comparisons are only valid if you're comparing 2 chains with the same rules. For example when bitcoin has 2 simultaneous blocks found and decision needs to be made which one to keep and build on, and which one to discard. BTC and bcash do not follow same rules. BTC and segwit2x do not follow same rules.

Beijing has higher population today than number of btc to exist. Everyone in just Beijing cannot mathematically possess a whole bitcoin. For today's already mined 16.x million coins a good comparison is population of Delhi. There are at least 350 million middle class people in China. That's more than entire population of USA. These 350 million people with some discretionary incomes could only hope to possess a fraction of bitcoin. Just imagine all the other groups of people potentially getting interested and buying bitcoin from this point forward. There will only be 21 million coins.

Think of segwit2x blockchain as litecoin. It's a completely different and separate coin, but it is spendable using BTC private keys which have a balance prior to the fork. The blockchain is copied up to a certain block, so all balances are copied on the s2x chain as well. But, it's a separate coin. It needs its own wallets, its own ticker on exchanges, and so on.
This particular fork is an attack on bitcoin because its developer wants to push his own ICO blaming that bitcoin is unstable due to.. you guessed it, random forks. So there is no replay protection at the moment. The problem is as you described it, spending coins on either chain spends it on another. To prevent this, someone will come up with instructions. Whatever happens, never enter your seeds or private keys into any websites claiming to help you split.

There is no "core team." Bitcoin Core is an open source software project with hundreds of contributors. Blockstream is Adam Back's company. Some of the contributors to Bitcoin Core software work for it.
The whole point of bitcoin is censorship resistance. A transaction network that can be shut down by attacking a center or a few major hubs is not interesting. That's been done before and those were shut down or abused (implement financial surveillance and gatekeeping basically). High fees are the effect of supply and demand. Demand for block space is very high.

All of the parties have an interdependency. Nodes will not accept blocks where miners want to issue themselves an extra 1000 BTC. Miners will not try to mine blocks like that since it costs them in electricity and no one will buy the fake 1000 tokens. Users, merchants, and exchanges will not honor the fake tokens either. Everyone benefits by following the rules rather than cheating.
Anyone can contribute code to bitcoin and if it's good it will be merged. But again, if the code is contentious, something that only a few people want and the rest do not, 99.9% of nodes will not upgrade to this new code. They are not required to. The actual proposed changes are using a bip process with somewhat formal writeups of the changes and public discussions on their merits.

Dollar's underlying value is the same as bitcoin - someone accepts it for payment because someone else accepts it for payment. BTC replacing the dollar is not likely, nor desirable. No need to worry about that.

Bitcoin itself. Mining reward decreases every 2 weeks as more and more miners join in. Eventually you're burning up as much in electricity as you earn in BTC. And one day, you're burning up more and it's better to just turn them off. And good luck reselling them then.

I recommend watching a 2011 movie called [In Time] ( The premise is that people work for basically time, to stay alive, and they trade it for goods and services as money. Their security is quite awful, people can just jack your time off your arm, so we've got a way better system with private/public keys for sure.  Not comparing hours of life to bits directly, but parallels can be drawn. Bitcoin is the most important network of them all. All others can exist and the best ones will be settled on BTC blockchain, using 1 transaction to record settlement of a million coffees or whatever.

It's an exchange owned by coinbase. As with ANY exchange, you will gently ask for permission to access your funds by requesting a withdrawal of BTC to your own wallet. They may or may not deny your request at any time on their whim. At this time they allow people to withdraw, but you never know.

Dollar "market cap" is much much bigger. Takes more to move it. But yes, dollar has volatility and trades up and down like BTC.
People buy shares hoping to sell them for more later. Same with BTC. Which part is hard for you?
You should be worried about banks taking all your money one day. The gold confiscation of the past will be 401k and deposits confiscation of the present. Much easier for corrupt gov to do this vs going to door to door shaking people down for gold again.
Volatility is greatly influenced by liquidity. Right now bitcoin is relatively small, so small moves can have outsize effects. This should not be difficult to grasp.

You paid $100 in fees. You sent a 5KB transaction. Each of those inputs on the left required a signature. Signatures take up space. You wanted to shove all this data into the blockchain, forever. That has a cost. You were charged for it. You sent this when demand for transaction space is high so whatever wallet you used set the fees quite high to get the transaction confirmed faster. If you learn how to set fees, use a wallet that lets you do that, and wait for a lull in transaction demand, this could have gone through for couple bucks.

Sending private key. This is a good way to ruin a relationship or friendship. The recipient could then move the funds and blame you for moving it because they know you still have the private key.

There is no team per se. It's 100's of contributors to the open source software project. You are not paying them anything and they do not owe you anything. You are welcome to add your own contribution to the code at any time. Some of the blame rests with bcash EDA bug. Miners occasionally switch to mine bcash when its difficulty drops to shit.

Not being BTC is pretty much a fatal problem for any altcoin. The cheaper the coin, the fewer miners support it. The fewer miners, the less secure it is. It won't necessarily die outright. There might be a perfect equilibrium found between price and hashrate where difficulty stays almost the same every diff readjustment period. So let's say bcash will be a $10 coin with 1 petahash of mining behind it. You can still use it to send and receive transactions, and it will work fine. Except it's at permanent risk of being 51% attacked by the rest of the sha256 hashrate out there, just like most of the smaller altcoins can be whether they use scrypt or x11 or whatever. Having $100 worth of bcash would be OK. Having any more than that is too much risk when much better alternative (BTC) exists. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:15:34
There is transaction preview. Look at fee in sats per byte or BTC/KB. You need to set it to correct amount. Read instructions. See bottom chart.  In less than 10 min you're out of luck. There is nothing you can do at all to make blocks come any faster. But you can make sure you are in the next block. Looks to me like 140 sats per byte or 0.0014 BTC/KB will do it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:48:36
As far as sorting them by fee per byte in miner's queue, probably not. The 180 one is getting close. The 88 one has 8 megs on top of it. Might get lucky with variance and get like 6 blocks mined quickly in a row to chew through backlog faster.

1) Your guess how much the price of btc will go up every month. It could be minus 5% for all we know. Higher and higher prices, or even stable prices, are not guaranteed.
2) The more people mine the higher the difficulty to make sure blocks are found ~10 min apart. Every ~2 weeks or so difficulty increases since more and more miners are joining in. This means miners earn less and less. The opposite can also be true. If big miner shuts down difficulty will adjust down and remaining miners will get paid slightly more.
Do not mine. Mining was basically free money back in the day. Now it's a competitive industrial scale business.

Old system is what we still have so being caught up in it is not some kind of character flaw with me. Much larger tax evasion is occurring everywhere. Bitcoiners with chump change will not affect much. It is the larger entities, those who made millions, is who IRS will be after. It is hard to launder a lot of money, at least I don't know how to do it, so it seems hard. And sure, paying 20-30% of gains really sucks, but most people who became rich would rather live free without looking over their shoulder, enjoy the 80-70% of their money, vs wasting most of it on lawyers and maybe even going to jail.

Nobody mines with "computers" anymore. Miners use dumb boxes that do sha256 very very fast. The purpose of mining is to confirm transactions period. Mining must continue indefinitely. The current 12.5BTC block rewards that miners get for finding a block is a fair coin issuance mechanism. Rather than premining all coins and handing them out to buddies, the system slowly releases new coins to those people who have skin in the game, the miners.

Wallets store keys, not coins. Coins are debit and credit entries in distributed ledger called blockchain. If you have 1 BTC assigned to an address in electrum, the key for that address will also have access to spend 1 b2x or whatever they will call that shitcoin after the fork. But it will need to be imported into b2x wallet. Right now the main one is btc1. Might be others but no reason to worry about it since b2x blockchain does not exist yet.

Don't pick segwit. It will create a wallet with bech32 addresses that almost no other wallet understands yet.
Wallets store keys. Same keys will be able to spend altcoin on the forked off chain if you own btc prior to the fork. You don't need to do anything to get it but you will need to carefully spend both coins separately such that transaction on one chain does not get replayed on another chain. Wait for instructions.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:52:36
Order the new one. It's quite a bit better and is likely to be supported for longer than the original. Seed is a random number. It's given to you as words so it's easier to write down without errors. Seed + math generates sequential private keys, as many as you need. The wallet takes care of all that so you don't have to worry about managing individual keys and addresses.

Fiat currency means "by decree" which basically says: these paper notes of whatever your country is are legal money and can be used to settle debts. The $1 note, $20, and $100 are the same size but are different value. Why? Because the government said so. If you draw your own $100 bill it is not money. Why? Because again, the government said so. With bitcoin nobody says bitcoin is worth $20,000. If nobody wants to value and buy 1 BTC for $20k then it's not worth $20k.

There is no way to prevent miners from jumping on bcash other than making it nonprofitable. Today that shit is hitting over $1000. So sometimes blocks will take a while to be found. To prevent transaction getting skipped block after block, pay the high fee.  At some point it doesn't make sense to pay $5 for tacos and $7 for tx fee. Use the cheaper payment method you have. It's an option to use btc, it's not a requirement.

It was never about longest chain. You can create your own bitcoin fork, set difficulty to 1 and mine with your computer 1000 blocks an hour. Certainly your chain will be longer but it's not bitcoin.

Not everyone has the same entry and exit points. Someone who bought at $1000 will be happy to cash out some at $10k. As the price goes up, eventually someone's price targets are reached and they sell, at least a portion.
Think of it this way. Invest what you can afford to lose. If someone was lucky to invest $10000 that they could lose a few years ago and now their holdings are worth $1 million +. Cannot afford to lose that million. It is prudent to cash in at least some of it.

Trading is best on exchanges since LBC would be terribly slow. I believe using the site to buy some btc for yourself is not illegal. Also if you wanted to later sell some of that btc it's fine. But if you are *arbitraging* between LBC and *some other exchange* **repeatedly** that's going be a red flag. The volume may be the biggest issue. Running $500 through once in a while is nothing. Running $5000 through every week - red flag. Or selling like $20k at once for cash.

@_date: 2017-11-10 19:41:33
That's an address, not txid.
Miners temporarily defected to exploit an EDA bug in bcash. Block interval in BTC is now about 2x as long so transactions clear much slower. You paid 170 sats/byte and priority fee right now is in 300's. You may be able to do RBF or CPFP.

Block reward is a coin issuance mechanism. Mining will continue indefinitely even after block rewards end. Miners will be paid with transaction fees. Some miners will not survive and quit.

1) In the blockchain with a copy on 1000s of nodes. Your mobile phone app stores keys, never coins. Keys are used to sign transactions to move the funds from one address to another.
2) Locate an exchange that operates there. I'm sure there is a famous search engine you can use.
3) To own and use BTC once you have it - no. But to buy it from an exchange you may need to be 18+. If you're under you can probably buy for cash from someone in person or from a bitcoin ATM (those can be expensive).

Transaction fees are a part of life. You are adding a permanent record that everybody has to save. Transactions are prioritized by fee. If you pay very little your transaction may never confirm and fall off bouncing your payment in 3-4 days.

You are at risk every time you enter these passwords to mount the file and to open electrum wallet. Keyloggers. Hardware wallets do not give the system access to the keys when you spend coins. In your case once you enter the passwords and spend whatever system you're on potentially has access to everything. If you don't intend to get a hardware wallet use your setup only on a separate secure machine. Other option would be to boot up a linux live ISO every time to access your stuff on USB stick.

Did you also move the wallet.dat file and did the client just create a new wallet.dat file in its place which has nothing to do with your old addresses? Find your original wallet.dat, make a copy of it and put it where the new one is now. Depends on your OS.
Make copies of all your wallet.dat files wherever they are just in case before overwriting any of them.

Growing cattle is bad. You better give up steak. Burning gasoline is bad. You better hop on a bicycle. Mining pretty much anything is bad for environment. Shut off the device you're using to come here to argue, it was built using materials mined out of the ground. You get the idea, people do what they can to improve their situation and unintended consequences be damned.
The electricity consumed has been paid for. The electric companies may want to consider their environmental impact. They can invest some of their profit towards that end, OR they can raise their rates to reduce consumption. Bitcoin miners will start or stop equipment as needed considering their costs.

Cheap transactions are not a priority. You can use litecoin for that or doge. Censorship resistance and immutability are priority. Without these things bitcoin can be taken over or shut down. We already have many centralized payment systems that can also be regulated, used for financial surveillance, or shut down for non-compliance. Bitcoin with same properties as those centralized system is not interesting. It would have no reason to exist, as it does what it does in very inefficient and expensive ways. At the moment the inefficiencies and cost is tolerated because a system like this has never been built before, so it's worth it.

Majority of the coins will be mined within the next few halvings. Transaction fees will account for a major part of miner's pay. This will change mining from what it is today.

Left green are buy orders. Right red are sell orders. If you look directly up from $10060 to where the green line is, then look directly left - that's the number of BTC that needs to be sold to get down to that price. To me it roughly looks like 200.
Where the orders meet and complete is the current price. Most bots place orders near where the price meets to get in on the action.

Fees to buy on coinbase. Fees to send to your wallet. Fees to send back to coinbase. Fees to sell on coinbase. Buying and selling fees are trading fees that coinbase charges.

High transaction demand is not indicative of trading. That occurs mostly off chain. It indicates people are moving their BTC but who knows for what reason?

ETH based tokens are mostly shit. You have to pay a tax in ETH to move them. If they have bugs they can be drained. ETH too sometimes gets backlogged. I've decided to orderly exit all my ETH based token positions. Too much risk there. All this ICO government overwatch BS with KYC can kiss my butt too.

There are many reasons why people invest. Main reason is probably because the price is going up. If it was $2 you, and I, and 330K other people wouldn't be on this sub. While there may be some hardcore believers, most people approach bitcoin with evaluation of risk/reward.
You are trying to say that a small beta software project is going to solve major problems of humanity and this is naive and laughable. Having a functional value transfer mechanism is not enough to ensure "universal equality and dissipation of suffering." There will still be haters and losers and plenty of evil in the world. Bitcoin by itself, even if it is decentralized, is not enough to ensure peace and compassion. The notion that it might is being sold PR style along with "instant and free transactions" and "help the unbanked" and other such marketing labels.

Say you're using an awesome wallet called electrum. It connects to electrum nodes. These are run by.. whoever. They will have knowledge of your entire wallet's contents. They don't know you, but they know how much you have and where you sent it. Someone could be aggregating this data.

Nope. Wallets store keys not bitcoins or dollars.
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:42:38
Wallet is a collection of addresses. Basically your seed words + math generates private keys, then public keys from them, then addresses from pub keys. Funds associated with an address are spendable using the private key it was generated from. It's fine to leave your BTC spread out across many addresses, for better privacy. But you can consolidate to another address if you like. It is highly unlikely someone can find private key for an address and clean it out. Lastly, multiple "deposits" to the same address are not combined, they are saved as separate inputs associated with the address.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:22:29
What specifically are you asking? These guys are creating another coin.  Instead of starting their blockchain from scratch they are taking a snapshot of BTC blockchain and extending it further. This does not affect BTC blockchain. All balances are copied. Those who had BTC prior to the snapshot can use their private keys to spend the coin on the alternate blockchain. Bgold is a completely different coin. Like litecoin or Ethereum. It will require its own wallet to use it. Entering your btc private keys into their new wallet is risky so they should already be spent on BTC side. If replay protection is not built in, transaction on one chain can be duplicated, losing funds. Bgold is being very weird about their coin, with some premine bullshit. I expect it will be worth like 50 cents.

You're definitely getting hit with a premium. Your best bet is to locate a proper exchange. I don't know which one would work for your specific situation. 
Transaction fees are based on network demand  Many services do not estimate them correctly. You can control fees with precision using a proper wallet like electrum once you're in possession of BTC.

Decentralized means there is no one central server to take control over and introduce unwanted changes to the system. Every user of the system runs their own node enforcing the rules.
Essentially most btc will be mined in the next 20 years. After so many halvings, btc rewards per block will be getting quite small compared to transaction fees in the same block. Around year 2140 no more mined coins will come out. Miners will get paid strictly with fees. Who knows what mining will look like in more than 100 years or if bitcoin will still be around. No more btc found. Only under 21 mill exist. Some are "lost" when users forget their perfectly good passwords. Happened to me, couldn't figure a pw to a wallet worth around $2000. Had to give up. Lots of other coins are inaccessible/unspendable/burned, like the ones in biteater address. So overtime the number of usable coins will continue to shrink. Bitcoin's 8 decimal places can be increased if there is an unlikely monumental coin shortage.

Correct, only on the 10 you sell.
From 2012 you're going to pay quite a bit. Let's say you bought @ $13.50. You are selling 10 coins. So 60760-135=60625
60625*0.2=$12,125 is you tax owed.

A reminder that comparing 2 chains for the most proof-of-work only matters for chains with the same consensus rules. b2x clearly will not have the same consensus rules, therefore it will be an altcoin. It's like saying well, if dogecoin has more proof of work than litecoin then doge becomes LTC!

No. You could deduct if it's given as proper charitable donation. In general though, you owe tax on your gain. If you're giving away 1 BTC it's $6k today, and you bought it for $2k, you must pay tax on the $4k gain. You are realizing this profit before you are gifting it, so you're on the hook. The recipient can accept tax free gift of up to $14000 I believe.

It's deflationary by design. That only really matters if majority is hoarded. Look at the charts, plenty of coins to buy at lower and lower prices. No hoarding here, profits are being taken and coins distributed to new owners. This is good. Not so good for those who locked in big losses but that's the risks of the game.
As for technological and mathematical advances.. I don't know. I'm not a math or electronics expert. Cracking early blocks doesn't make sense though. If you move those coins you invalidate the early blocks and ALL the rest of them after. That's nonsense. What is likely to happen is replacement of mining algo, addition of a version of proof of stake, or some other changes to ensure integrity of the chain at a cost commensurate with rewards for securing it.

How do you make money from money? You invest it. People buy BTC at lower price and sell it at higher price. The difference is profit.

Keeping funds on exchange is always risky. You are not in control. Exchanges are fat targets and can get hacked. Inside job absconding with the funds is not out of the question. Paper addresses are great for long term storage, if created, stored, and backed up securely. Hardware wallets are good for secure storage and spending, again if initialized and backed up securely.

Today Joe's bitcoins are worth just over $1 million dollars. Does Joe want to "avoid fiat and banks" or does he want to improve his financial situation?
Joe should sell enough to pay off almost all of his debt and a little bit to splurge. Maybe new toolbox for the truck and an out of town getaway with the spouse. If bitcoin drops to zero tomorrow, Joe would be better off without debt vs sitting on coins that made him a millionaire on paper.

No one can predict the future.
Comparing market caps of cryptocurrencies can be misleading. Bytecoin has a $250 million market cap - have you seen anyone actually do anything with the coin? Nah, it's worthless premined junk.
If stocks collapse, the stock holders will lose money, not suddenly gain massive riches that they need to park somewhere.
Don't forget about capacity issue. If there is a stampede to get into BTC, deposits and withdrawals to and from exchanges will be stuck for days. ~370k transactions per day may sound like a lot but it is not for a large number of concurrent users. Transaction fees will become very high. It is possible overflow will go into altcoins, or straight down the toilet as evidenced by idiots buying into some of these ICOs.

TLDR: mining is a competitive business, not easy money. Mining bitcoin at home is almost always a losing proposition now. Mining other coins with GPU's is an option but you're in the wrong sub for that.
Show your math. Which hardware do you plan to buy? Which coin do you plan to mine? Are you aware of difficulty retargeting? i.e. you earn less and less as more and more miners join in. Rewards will not remain $1500/month flat forever, but rather dwindle to zero over time. Also, some miners are power hungry. Your parents will want you to chip in on the extra $200-500 month in electricity costs.

Your OS will have access to keys any time your wallet is unlocked. Some malware waits for privkey strings in clipboard.

If we were to assume the dollars and bitcoins on the exchange are real and accounted for, then this is fine. Seller can only sell what BTC they have. Buyer can only buy with what funds + margin they have. If it's a whale playing on both sides of that channel then it's fine too! The bigger they are the more money they are risking. At any moment another whale could come in and buy up their entire invisible bid. Price will start going up and whale 1 will have sold for less than they could have got. They can't double sell those coins again.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:01:06
Bitcoin transactions are not instant, regardless of the wallet used. I like Electrum. You can set the right transaction fee to have your transaction confirmed in the first or the next block. If you are receiving from somewhere, and the sender didn't attach high enough fee, that's not the fault of Electrum. In fact you may be able to use CPFP with it in such a case.

@_date: 2017-10-20 20:01:23
You will own 1 bgold.
Same as the others, if you have 1 bitcoin before the fork you will have 1 s2x coin.
All of these are 1) spendable using your BTC keys, 2) are on their separate blockchain, 3) need their own wallet. You will have BTC, Bcash, Bgold, and s2x coins, but only if you had BTC prior to the forks.
Yeah you have to chose, but not necessarily very fast. BTC will definitely be fine. The 3 others are questionable. Your BTC is not in ledger nano s, it is in the blockchain. Your ledger nano s holds keys to it. Nothing will happen to BTC, but like I said these keys will also be able to spend the altcoins on the alternate chains.

No. It will not merge back. And you need to worry about replay problem. A signed transaction on one chain will be valid on another chain unless strong 2 way replay protection is implemented. I.e. you may unintentionally send coins on both chains at once. S2X is implementing a shitty and cludgy replay protection. I know what I'm doing and even I will wait for dust to settle down and for clear instructions to be posted on how to send coins on both chains to new keys without affecting each other.

Circulated through doesn't mean that's how much sellers got to keep. 
"safe haven, with little to no risk of being caught" is something you read in bad articles. Bitcoin is not anonymous.
Most sellers probably had to pay for resupply and did not keep most of their funds in bitcoin. Some big sellers are probably rich now and guess what, likely are not selling anymore. No reason. They were selling before to make a profit. So there, fewer criminals for you.

Unlike game tokens bitcoin can be spent for almost anything everywhere and acceptance is growing. With egifter cards you can shop at retail stores or online.
People trade on exchanges between each other. Banks have nothing to do with bitcoin. Individuals trade their dollars for bitcoins and vice versa. You can't "convert" bitcoin to dollars but you can sell it to anyone who wants to buy it.
There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies with most of them using their own blockchain. Just having something blockchain based doesn't do anything. It needs to have demand so people buy it. JPM coin is likely going to be controlled by JPM. Few people would want a coin where central authority can freeze or delete your funds because bitcoin exists already and no one can do that on bitcoin. Gold-backed and redeemable is third party risk - you have to trust someone to watch over the gold. They could run with it. No third party in BTC.

Not if they want to get paid. Their incentive is not to produce invalid blocks or they waste electricity for nothing. It pays to play by the rules and it costs to cheat.
1 confirmation means a block was generated by miner and transaction was recorded in that block.

Nodes verify all this and the network is in consensus that the block is good and miner deserves their payout.

Mind when BTC is exchanged into fiat when using these. One of these cards sells associated BTC on the spot at time of transaction at current rate. The other sells it when you recharge the card.

If you're new, you're probably not using segwit addresses at the moment - no easy way for that. Segwit has been tested for a while before activation but that doesn't mean some edge case vulnerability doesn't exist. Personally I'm not in a hurry to move my long term funds to segwit addresses.

Does your deposit address start with 3? It might be a segwit address or a multisig address. If it starts with 1 it's neither.
Hard to tell. Not very important as long as you can withdraw in full.
You did. Transactions from segwit addresses come with a discount. From regular address, even to segwit addresses, no discount. You will pay lower fee sending from segwit address vs non-segwit, in general, but fee amount would depend on how busy the queue is. There are no "segwit bitcoins," only the addresses. Note a very important piece: wallets do not store coins. They store keys. Keys are required to sign transactions to "send" coins, which is unlocking them with one key and relocking them with key to the receiving address.

Nope. You exposed seed words to your computer's operating system and everything that's running on it, malware included. The point of hardware wallet is that seed and private keys never leave the chip in the wallet. Initializing hardware wallet should be done ideally on Linux OS while disconnected from the internet. You can later send transactions using regular OS.
Don't bump your head or you might forget the seed. Actually, this seed you can trash, it's been exposed. New one should be securely backed up (encrypted) outside your place of residence.

Wallets hold spending keys. No key, you can't spend the coin. Coinbase keeps your keys hidden from you. You have no control. In coinbase you go to send screen, put in one of your wallet addresses and send. No coins are really sent anywhere. The bitcoin ledger (blockchain) is updated saying "unlock funds at key 1, and relock them with key 2." Key 2 in this scenario is in your wallet, on desktop or mobile. Each address has its own key. Wallets create keys and addresses as needed, you don't have to manage each address/key separately. Security is important. Various key stealing malware can clean you out with no recourse. In some cases it is easier to let a company like coinbase control keys, but then you don't get a choice about forked coins. For example, from last fork, CB is holding people's bcash until January 2018.

Not for nothing - to avoid getting sued. Your BTC private keys would control this altcoin as well, so you would definitely get it if you controlled your keys.

Yes. 
Not really although miners can generate transactions to increase average fees for long periods of time. Miners do get paid in btc so they want the value of btc to be high. If they abuse the fees into too much for too long, people will dump btc for an altcoin that is cheaper to use, like dash, litecoin, eth. Not good for btc miners. They need to maintain balance.
It changes how transaction size is accounted for. Signatures are not counted towards the 1000000 byte block size limit. Signatures are a lot of data in each transaction. As more transactions use segwit (it's at 9% now) more and more transactions can fit into each block. That clears the queue quicker. Segwit is kinda roundabout way to increase the limit without changing the actual limit value. It does help a few other things like fixing tx malleability problem.

You probably got one address, not a wallet. Wallet is a collection of keys. Get one here 
I would recommend electrum for desktop, mycelium for mobile. You can import the private key into the wallet which will empty out your bitaddress.org address. The wallets will give you 12 words. Securely save these outside your main place of residence in case you will need to recover the wallet.

B2X is using version 14 which did have segwit. So in theory you should do nothing at all. You will need to follow a guide posted later on how to spend both coins separately without them getting replayed on the alternate chain.

Paper or hardware wallet.

Replace the word bitcoin with money. What do you get?
Best way to earn money is by rent seeking of course. Or collect dividends and capital gains on your investments while sitting on yer butt. The other ways are to provide a product or a service, commonly known as operating a small business. Lastly, would be to rent your time, aka get a job.

So you deposit to exchange. With correct fee that's ~10 minutes. Exchange may hold for 2 or 3 confirmations, so ~30 minutes. Then you do some kinda trade but withdraw your coins?? Okay.. Well, withdrawing your coins from exchange may take a few min for them to send it to the network, depending on the exchange. Then it's ~10 min for confirmation.

There is no free lunch. I don't know how bitconnect "works" but paying out for nothing has all signs of being some ponzi scam. Google it "bitconnect scam"
There are many different "coins." Bitcoin is top dog. A few others have their own spin, like litecoin with shorter block time. Vast majority of coins have no use; their best feature is they are able to be traded for bitcoin. You seem to know enough already and got bitcoin purchased. Next thing is safety.  Get a wallet to store your keys.
Anything promising to earn you percentage on your BTC is suspicious. The only exception may be loaning at an exchange like poloniex or bitfinex but rates are crap, and keeping BTC on any exchange is always a risk.

Market rate. Whatever people trade it for given liquidity. Remember bcash, blocks hours apart and it took 20 confirmations for a deposit. So I couldn't sell for a few days while price was dwindling. Same for BTC, market rate. Can't really know what it will be till we get there. Coinbase DID attempt to steal people's Eth Classic in the past. Well, they didn't want to bother dealing with it really. But then complaints mounted and they learned their lesson. But damage was already done. For all forks if your keys are in a proper wallet, soft or hardware, you can use them to claim the alt. CB is not the only way.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:59:01
Too many people are holding onto their bcash hoping it is going be worth something or whatever. Some of it is locked up by the likes of coinbase. If people dumped it into the ground like they were supposed to, miners wouldn't have an incentive to switch to mine it, bringing on the bcash spiral of death much much sooner.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:45:11
It is not possible. Bitcoin will be spent only once. First transaction will not be "spent" it will be rejected. The store may give you your item, however. All they have to do is wait for 1 confirmation. Annoying, but that's how blockchain based settlement networks operate. Perhaps future enhancements will improve this situation.

The spending key on the paper wallet will also be usable to spend coins on any of the forked off chains. You need to follow instructions on how to claim other coins and you will have to re-create the paper wallet. Coins will be fine through the fork. You will have to make some choices as to which chain's coins to keep. People who chose bcash earlier did not do well. You can keep all of them and sell none too.
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:34:14
Wallets store keys not coins. You do not receive anything, certainly not "two bitcoin forks." A fork is an event. If there is an additional alternate chain after the fork your BTC private keys will be able to spend the shitcoin on the alternate chain.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:48:52
Yes paper wallets are receive many but spend only once and need to be re-created. There are quite a few airdrop type coins that entitle btc owners to some coins. I've collected gbyte, lumens, bitcore, bcash so far. All of these are increasing my BTC count as I dump them. It is a hassle, especially if your funds are spread over many many addresses but is worth it. I'm thinking bgold may be a flash in the pan, but not sure about s2x.

Bcash had 7 blocks in 2 hours or 17 minute confirmations.
Bitcoin had 15 blocks in 2 hours or 8 minute confirmations. Whoever needs a confirmation in 8 minutes would need to just pay the fee appropriate for current level of demand for block space.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:17:20
Blocks must fit lots of rules. One of those rules is the amount of subsidy/reward. It can be set lower, but not higher. If it's higher, block is invalid and will be ignored by all other miners and nodes.

Multi-sig also called m of n. You can have 6 (or more) keys each known to 1 of 6 people. Transaction may require 2-6 of the 6 keys to be spent. So if you set it to 5 of 6, at least 5 people will need to collude to steal the funds.

Tax avoidance is legal. Tax evasion is not. You can pay no tax if your income is below a certain level, $36k/year something like that, and you hold BTC for over a year. It's possible the law will be passed to exempt reporting requirements for purchases with BTC under $600. Then you can buy gift cards for $599 and shop with them for groceries, amazon, retail stores, etc. gyft.com or egifter.com It's not a law yet so you would have to report gains and pay tax when buying gift cards now.

BTC dominance didn't fall only because altcoins gained a lot. It fell because MORE altcoins were added. And ALL of them combined are being compared to BTC. Creating a new altcoin always harms btc dominance, so how is that comparison useful?

Why forks? Because. Anyone can fork any coin. Just get some nodes and start mining blocks with new rules. Forks are a distraction. Instead of improving BTC, people's time and skills are wasted on creating an altcoin. They can cause loss of funds without replay protection. And they are creating confusion.

They very much do. Most lambos are driven very little, they just sit in garages looking good. Could get a used one for much much less. If I was suddenly in a position to afford one, and hit my head on concrete to actually decide it's a good idea, I'd buy a used one.
I watch lots of car videos on youtube and basically came to conclusion that a nice car will get you mostly attention from males rather than females. Good, if you're into dudes, which I am not. Even today my beemer gets nods and complements mostly from men. So lambo doesn't have much appeal. Can't even properly drive it in the city. Speed limit on interstate is 55 MPH.

Technically, no. It has currency-like properties and features that people ascribe to it. It's a distributed ledger with native token used to pay for immutable storage. It can be used to represent a value amount, or a piece of property, or contractual obligation. You could (at great expense) encode and store files. The whitepaper pdf is stored in the blockchain already. Currency is one use case. You don't take a piece of steel and say steel is a skyscraper.

Decentralization refers to lacking a central point of failure for the network as a whole. There are distributed nodes/users and miners. Knocking one or two or 100 off the network won't hurt it, new ones will pop up elsewhere.

Blockchain tech already exists and if copied its track record will follow with it. No need to re-prove yourself and catch up. Other coins are already eating BTC's lunch in terms of throughput, transaction fees, and even governance. Eth? Pah-leaze. I'm hearing it's already damn near impossible to sync a full Eth node from scratch in anything less than a month.
BTC is fantastic, no question. I see low throughput as its Achilles heel though. It just cannot function with even decently sized number of concurrent users. Scaling promises are not looking good. Lightning hubs and channels or whatever? Will believe it when I see it.

Coins don't exist. But lets say they do. They are always in the blockchain. What you have in your wallets are keys. With coinbase you don't know the keys. The coins are not in your phone, they are secured in the blockchain by the keys coinbase controls in their app.
It is better to use bitcoin core than coinbase for storing keys with value attached to them. The risk is that your PC may be infected and will steal keys out of core. Ideally use a hardware wallet initialized on a secure device. Or core, or lightweight wallet like electrum, set up on dedicated secure device. Nothing that runs Windows or is used for random web browsing. There are many security guides out there. I don't want to retype all the points.

Everyone's balances are copied and BTC owner gets an equivalent amount of coins on the alternate chain. The forked off coin is as different from bitcoin as litcoin or xmr, or dogecoin, even if it shares just about everything. Forked off coin has its own blockchain after the fork. BTC owners' private keys can spend coins on both chains.
For whatever reason the new altcoin has some nodes and mining support, and devs, and maybe a community and that group sees value in the coin. So they don't sell (limiting available supply for sale) what they own or purchase more, creating demand. Demand counteracts the supply that detractors want to dump and you get market rate, trading up and down.
Implications. Well it's creating a fucking mess of things. Services have to take sides, and operate at less than full capacity, i.e. freeze transfers during fork window. Forks affect BTC price pre and post fork as people buy to lock in a "dividend" and sell after. Taxing the new coin's gain from zero cost basis doesn't seem unreasonable, so entire amount you sell the altcoin for is taxable. After a while resources will be spread too thin to keep nodes and miners operational for every new additional forked off coin and exhaustion will set in. People will stop giving a damn and any new coin will be about worthless.

It's meant to replace bitcoin. No replay protection. It is based on older version of core with bugs which were already fixed in 15.0.1.

1. 
2. If it's non-contentious everyone upgrades and bitcoin continues to operate but with new rules which necessitated the fork. If it is contentions an alternate blockchain will emerge. BTC may continue as is and the alternate chain will have its own wallets, rules, coins, etc.
3. It's a copy of the blockchain so the alternate chain will have tokens spendable by the same private keys as used on BTC blockchain. Nobody can predict value of either token. Expecting x2s to be worth as much as BTC is unreasonable. Both coins will trade at whatever market rate influenced by supply and demand.
4. There is only one bitcoin. Any other coin, even the ones hijacking bitcoin's name, will need a separate wallet, or a wallet which supports both. It may take some time for support to be implemented. The tokens on alternate chain are new and not accepted as payment anywhere for anything.

Coinbase is an a tricky position to police people's "bad" activities. They probably don't want to but their hand is forced. So if customers do something "bad" they close their account, allow user to withdraw everything, and that's it. No chance at fixing it. This is simpler and cheaper for them than dealing with the customer - they have millions of customers and new signing up every day.
People posted account closures for things like sending BTC to betting/gambling services, sending BTC to darknet markets, possibly things dealing with adult websites, not sure. Point is - Coinbase is not a wallet. It is not to be used as a wallet. It is not to be used to hold BTC. It's a BTC vendor. Buy coins, get them out to a wallet where you control your keys.

Powerful computers is wrong. They are pretty dumb boxes loaded with boards and boards of chips that do one thing very very fast. It would be very expensive. Quantum computers don't exist.
Zeroes are padding. The resulting number must be smaller than certain value. Miners hash transaction data and a random number called nonce. They keep trying different numbers over and over. It is guessing and luck but generally pools find the number of daily blocks proportional to their hashrate. Pool with 25% hashrate is going to find 36 blocks per day, give or take.

Blocks hold transactions. Each block is limited to 1 million bytes. Any bigger and it won't match network consensus rules and will be rejected (pre-segwit*). Each transaction is stored forever. It takes up space. Most simple transactions (1 input, 1 output, 1 change address) are 226 bytes. Blocks are mined on average every ten min. If transactions in queue take up more space than 1 million bytes then the ones paying higher tx fees will get into next block, the rest will have to wait for the next one after it.
*Since segwit was activated transaction size is calculated in weight instead of bytes and signatures do not count towards the limit. So blocks bigger than 1MB are now valid. There is still a limit. Only about 15% of transactions are segwit type so far so we are not fully taking advantage of the transaction size discount just yet.

For that they need lots of deposits and it's in their best interest to be popular and secure. Some exchanges are worse than others and they do end up having btc stolen or run an inside job and disappear. Decentralized exchanges is a growing field. Bisq is one I know of.

Fork in the chain is when miners create a block that the network doesn't like. All nodes reject that block. However, if you have some miners and some nodes that like the new block type, they will accept it. Now you have 2 chains. Original chain keeps going, and new chain keeps going, like bcash chain (it's appaling that bcashers hijacked "bitcoin" for their altcoin's name). Can't really prevent this. Coins that are worthless are sort of immune to forks - there is no profit in wasting mining cycles to fork them.

They sold it at 0.1 BTC each. Sure, it's better now because bcash is trading at 0.0587, but it did trade at over 0.1 for about 6 weeks.

Many likely don't know what INR and Rs means.
It is commonly stated that USD lost 90+% of it's purchasing power since 1913. Similar things cost way more in dollars than they used to. There is this consumer price index thing with which they measure how much a pre-set basket of goods costs year to year. But the fuckers cheat. Like one year they substituted salmon for cheaper fish, reasoning that people will buy lower priced food when prices go up. So the index doesn't track actual degree of how fast the value of fiat money is falling.

1) Transactions are queued up on each node. Miners pick up the juiciest ones with highest fees first and confirm them into blocks every 10 min or so.
2) Transactions must be legit in every way or they do not get confirmed. No confirmation, no coins move anywhere.
3) Bad transactions are not fixed, they are ignored. Many things need to be correct, like valid inputs, valid signatures, coins weren't already spent in another transaction, etc.

There is a very strong incentive to run a full node. It lets you use BTC without trusting some SPV wallet or 3rd party services. Node sees the true state of the network. Of course, for $20 in BTC a smartphone wallet is just fine.

You can read the source code for the wallet software and compile it yourself. You would have to know how to do that; otherwise you have to trust someone else reviewed the code. That's a limitation, but it's on your part. You COULD learn how to understand the code and read it, you are choosing not to. Which is fine, so do most people.
Your internet connection is fine. Nothing is sent over the internet which would allow people to steal your finds. Signed transaction data does not reveal private keys. The phone or PC on which you run the wallet apps are another story. Apps can steal keys. Your phone wallet can be similar to your regular wallet - it can always be stolen, so you keep only a little bit of cash/btc there. For safer storage and usage buy a hardware wallet.

There are no coins in wallets. The balances are debits and credits entries in the blockchain ledger. Wallets store keys (i.e. long passwords) to be able to "send" coins. "Sending" coins is basically unlocking with sender's private key and relocking with private key of the receiving address. The key in one wallet or 5 wallets can only spend balances associated with it. You don't get more coins by copying keys to more wallets obviously.

Define success for bitcoin. Is it there already? Close? Long way to go?
You're looking at an exchangeable token. Sure, it has neat features. But it's just a collectible. It's not sliced bread or second best thing to it. Its value is very much influenced by news cycles, regulatory pressures, speculation, and so forth. Throughput is abysmally low (perhaps LN will alleviate that). Maintenance of the network (hashrate) must not drop too low and may have to grow indefinitely, which is expensive. Competing tokens work in much similar ways and do a better job at user experience - nice wallets, faster confirmations, etc. Financial surveillance is a risk, at least until confidentiality is built-in and is easy to use.

There are 2 types of fees. Coinbase charges a fee to buy or sell, their trading fee (unless you use gdax). Then there is a transaction fee charged by the miners. This fee can be set with precision correctly by a 10 year old if they know [where to look]( but automated systems still seem to have a problem with that. They are either overpaying or underpaying.
Look up your transactions on a block explorer and look at the transaction fees. You can't control this when you're the recipient, but you can set them correctly when you are the sender.

If you know what you're doing. Ideally you should have control of your keys. However security becomes a priority. If you are using malware infected Windows XP you're better off just leaving coins on coinbase.

b2x has nothing to do with bcash. bcash has a difficulty adjustment bug where difficulty drops hard. They can mine blocks fast and earn the 12.5 bcash subsidy payments fast. Once difficulty goes up they switch back to mining btc. Not everyone does it, but I almost can't blame the miners who do. They are in it for the profit and for short intervals bcash is a better coin for them to mine.

Bitcoin will not be affected. An altcoin chain will be created and be mined (maybe) separately. You have no choice what happens to your bitcoin since you surrendered full control of it to coinbase. You potentially miss out on getting bgold tokens.

Chances of creating a used address is called collision and is astronomically unlikely. There is no need to be checking for addresses against the network. Addresses can be generated offline entirely.

Private key is used to sign spending transactions and public key (public so known to the world) is then used to validate the signature without needing private key to be revealed.

Purchase from gdax yes, if you can use it. Market maker orders are free. Then you can withdraw to your own wallet. Don't believe you can set desired transaction fee on coinbase but heard that withdrawals from gdax might be free also. Well, they pay it for you. If fee is set too low transaction will sit unconfirmed until all higher paying fee transactions are completed. The delay may take hours or days.

It is an event when blockchain splits into two (or more). Ideally we have one chain, history of all transactions. When a group of people (let's call them corporate assholes) want to control bitcoin they create a client and spin up a bunch of nodes that operate with new rules. Then some asshole miners join in and mine blocks that follow their new rules. Original BTC chain keeps going just fine and remains bitcoin. New chain has all the history up to the fork but goes off in different direction after it. Anyone who had BTC before the fork also has same amount of asscoins on the new asshole chain. Sometimes replay protection is introduced and people can easily spend their asscoins. That's like.. free money.

Some people mine one coin on purpose, like ETH let's say. Others just contribute hashrate via a service and that service automatically mines whatever coin is best and allegedly pays out later in BTC. I suppose GPUs can be sold off on ebay a year or so down the road. In theory the price you get back for the cards plus the payouts for mining should result in some profit. In practice I dunno if that really happens.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:39:18
Market order completes immediately. It can go through the order book buying (or selling) until completed regardless of the price. Limit order completes only at the price you set. It may even never complete, i.e set buy at $1 - it's unlikely to get filled anytime soon. If limit order is placed slightly away from market price it sits in the order book. If many users do this the buy and sell books get filled up which is good for liquidity. Gdax charges no trade fee on those.

Existence of a cryptographically secured token on a distributed ledger doesn't make it a currency. Currencies need a good degree of acceptance.

Everyone who has BTC will get b2x for free. People do not value what they get for free. There is zero acceptance for b2x coin. Can't buy anything directly with it. It will be sold by the ton fast. Miners will have a choice to mine BTC, bcash, or b2x. They will mine whatever is most profitable. As price of bcash and b2x continues to tank fewer and fewer miners will mine them. Low hashrate, transaction confirmations take hours or days. People dump even faster. Death spiral.

Pool doesn't matter. What matters is who gets the BTC payout. It is estimated that majority of hashrate is concentrated in China, cheap electricity and whatnot.

You will have both if you buy before the fork. However, if s2x coin is worth about 20% of BTC and BTC price drops 30% because "aah fork, sky is falling" weak hands, then you'd be better off buying after. No one can predict this. I'm going to hold on to what BTC I have and collect the s2x coin. Will observe how it does on the market and possibly sell some or all of it.

You had small amounts in 3 addresses. They were combined to a total of 0.101. From that, 0.0726 went where it needed to go and the difference 0.02919.. went to a change address in your wallet. At least it should have.

Wallets store keys, never coins. Wallets do not need to be online to receive. The balance is assigned to the address associated with specific key ledger generated. The movement of balances between addresses is recorded in the blockchain on 1000's of nodes.

Ugh, that shit again. $ doesn't go "into crypto" or "added to industry." Money goes to the seller. Seller then buys lambos or whatever and cannot sell again.
There is a simple way to reduce bitmain's dominance - compete with them. Start your miner fab plant, set up mining farms, etc. You are not doing them any harm by not buying BTC and sitting on your fiat.

Withdrawing has a specific meaning. Withdrawing bitcoin to PayPal was never possible. Paypal doesn't accept bitcoin. You can withdraw bitcoin from coinbase at any time to another exchange or to a proper (or shitty hosted) wallet.
You are referring to *selling* bitcoin on coinbase and then *withdrawing fiat* to paypal or bank account. There isn't any particular issue with withdrawing fiat to a bank account, not any more than doing so to PayPal. Sell your coins and withdraw funds to a bank account. If you want to avoid bank and paypal don't use coinbase.

Very few things require a blockchain. What you're proposing certainly doesn't. Blockchain is a way to store data in censorship resistant and trustless way. It also happens to be slow and expensive. No need to shove square pegs in round holes.

It doesn't prevent, but slows down, UTXO growth, by limiting throughput. It is necessary to have the UTXO set in full to verify all inputs. With rising BTC price transactions will have smaller and smaller amounts of BTC potentially growing UTXO set to petabytes in size.

Do not confuse seeds and private keys. Seed is words. Privkeys are numbers derived from seed. Addresses are derived from privkeys.
No. Signing with 1 key only proves you have that key and own that address. Other addresses should not be linkable to your first one. Don't know what you generated that seed with, it could be some old wallet that has a faulty generator.
