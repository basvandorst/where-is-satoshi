i'm off work now so i'm going to read all that stuff you sent. I just want a way to take my coin off of the grid completely until i want to use it to exchange, then pop it into a wallet meant for that purchase, do the transaction, and be done. Is that covered in the links you gave me?
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:39:52
Nah, I don't 100% buy it that it's a good long-term thing. It LOOKS LIKE it right now, but I don't trust what it looks like. Anything could happen. The whole thing could bust, it could get dwarfed by an altcoin with a gimmick that fools the layman public, it could become illegal, anything could happen.

I will read these and reply further after work... until then, my question is: "when is greater user-friendliness coming to bitcoin?"
I have no faith in the ability of bitcoin to go global without a way for grandma to buy and store some with no hassle. What should I understand about the state of that development? I won't trust my money in bitcoin if that's not coming soon. The tech won't grow without it.
@_date: 2014-06-08 07:17:47
well there's thousands of orders of magnitude of difference in verifiable certainty between the sun not rising tomorrow and bitcoin not spiking again. You could safely estimate the chances of the sun rising tomorrow at .99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
but you could really only estimate the chances of bitcoin hitting a massive spike in the next few weeks at, what, .6? 
I'm not JUST channeling hume on the induction fallacy, I'm also pointing to the fact that the induction fallacy weakens as an argument for a position against the existence of a pattern as the evidence for said pattern increases. We just don't have that much evidence. "It happened 3 times" is nothing like the sun rising every day for billions of years.
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:40:27
I said it was "eerily" stable. In november, the price hit nearly $1200 then fell to $400 by may. It's changing by tiny bits in comparison.
If bitcoin grows to $100,000 a coin and fluctuates by $80 daily, it will be stable enough to use as currency.


You have got to stop making these ridiculous predictions. Why does everybody think they're psychic as soon as money is involved?
@_date: 2014-06-08 01:39:00
I'm buying safely right now. I feel very strongly that bitcoin is a good investment at this time, but not so strongly that I'm willing to put money on it that I will need and cannot lose. I may be able to buy a single-digit number of extra coins before the swell, if there is one, and that satisfies me just fine.
@_date: 2014-06-16 05:19:37
A little bit because it's unpredictable whether you'll win or lose moeny, but a little bit not because there's not "house" to make sure you lose so it can win. Everyone who invests early wins together when the price goes up, and as long as the price stays up, people who invest later don't lose. Then people lose when (if) it all crashes.
So yes, it's risky like gambling, but no, it's not stupid or immoral like gambling because you're cooperating with people to make a thing become great rather than challenging something to see if you can profit off it at its expense.
investing is cooperative gambling against fate, whereas regular gambling is individualistic and against the house.

They use past data to make future predictions. It doesn't work because reality doesn't work that way. Predicting markets is like predicting weather -- you can be only half right short-term and wrong most of the time a week out, unless you live in death valley and every day is the same. Bitcoin is going to surprise everyone no matter what it does.

You really have to prove things to people before thy accept it. Visionaries are few and far between in the human race. If you told people that the automobile was going to take off before Henry Ford started cranking them out, they'd have said similar things. People used to think electricity was a stupid fad -- electricity! They said it was too dangerous and impractical and nothing would ever replace a good oil lamp.
Bitcoin isn't guaranteed to succeed, but we are not at a stage where the average person can recognize its potential. Once people are offered 2% off their online bill payments if they use  a one-click bitcoin account setup option, they will adopt.

You're forgetting that most people can't analyze political and financial news as well as you just did. If you're a European and you hear that the EU just created a negative interest rate for money stored in banks, and you're painfully stupid, (as most human beings are) then you might just interpret that news as good enough reason to buy bitcoin.
Just because a thing is true doesn't mean that people know it's true, understand it, or will act react to it rationally.

If you aren't careful to qualify your predictions as moderately-informed guesses, you are no better than those idiots who go to vegas with their savings because they "have a system."
It LOOKS like there is a pattern happening that is somewhat predictable. We have a reasonable amount of data to suggest that it is somewhat likely that there will be another swell. DO NOT BET THE FARM ON IT. IT IS A MARKET and markets are nothing at all if they are not fundamentally unpredictable.

Bitcoin will never be usable as a currency unless each bitcoin is worth many thousands of dollars. There are only 21 million bitcoins. Assuming that all of them are in circulation (they aren't and will never be) and assuming the price stays at 600, that equals 12 billion dollars.
12 billion dollars.
That's roughly $1.40 for each person alive.
Now remember that most bitcoin is hoarded in the hands of a few early adopters.
Do you really think that businesses are going to fuck with bitcoin to get a share of the $12bn that's equal to a few hundred dollars a month if tehy're lucky? Do you think coffee shops will accept bitcoin just in case one of the fabled few bitcoin owners graces them with their presence?
Until the market cap reaches hundreds of billions, bitcoin won't be worth adopting by anyone but a few big-name brands who want to look hip. For anyone but them, bitcoin will mean a lot of risk and effort just to accept a few dollars a month that they could accept in state-backed currency anyway.
Please get off your high horse about speculators. We need people who want to make money on bitcoin to get the price where it needs to be. We want people to throw thier money at it so that it becomes useable. The suggestion that bitcoin could be anything but a laughable novelty at $600 a coin is ridiculous because it assumes that it will be adopted globally by millions of businesses who are desperate for that one or two $3 coffees per month to be paid for in bitcoin because it's soooo cooooool.

I *hope* that bitcoin swells in value and becomes usable as an everyday currency. I don't dare to think it will. I'm not smart enough to figure that out.
I'm invested in it fairly heavily for my financial position and I hope to make some money selling on the peaks and buying on the dips. I also hope to have a significant amount of my money in bitcoin when it becomes user-friendly enough to get a drink at the bar with it or to pay a bridge toll with it.
But I don't know.
I'm taking what I see as a fairly large risk with my investment. I'm happy that I put money in and helped the tech grow, and I hope to gain value off of that as well as help launch the tech.

I'm expecting to see that too -- peple who bought when it was high and are hoping to just get their investment back. But that's not going to be a huge number of people or a huge amount of money. They will probably choke growth for a few weeks on the way to the spike if there is one.
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:35:38
I can't believe I'm actually explaining this.
1. because the vast majority of them will be able to get the same few hundred through conventional means without setting up bitcoin payments, meaning that the effort isn't worth it.
2. because the vast majority of adopters will never see any bitcoin payments at all because bitcoin will be such an incredibly miniscule share of the economy -- 12 billion dollars is a small percentage of a small percentage of the currency that exists on earth right now and the likelihood that any will be spent at their establishment at all is tiny.
3. because the bitcoin they do receive won't be easily spendable in other capacities and will need to be sold for fiat anyway, which is another pain in the ass and may result in losses.
If businesses cannot count on a significant portion of their daily business being done in bitcoin, tehy won't adopt. A business only has incentive to adopt if they are losing business to other businesses that have adopted bitcoin. with only 12 billion dollars worth of being passed around, the business that most businesses stand to lose is 0, and the business that others stand to lose is negligible.
Bitcoin has to go from billions to trillions to be a game changer.
@_date: 2014-06-12 00:59:27
I would sell to dollars, wait for a price drop, and reinvest and wait for the next bubble, then sell at the peak again, and reinvest again when it levels out. I would wait through YEARS of doing this for bitcoin to become a stable currency because I passionately hate the federal reserve and its relationship to the status quo and I believe bitcoin is a way of democratizing value exchange.
Once the money was spendable, I'd buy a modest home so I didn't have rent anymore and instead had a stable store of concrete value and a higher quality of life.

@_date: 2014-06-04 07:48:02
From the article:


I disagree. If bitcoin was 10 cents apiece, at 21 million coins, that would be a total spendable value of $2,100,000 USD. Two million dollars worth of bitcoin in circulation isn't enough to get businesses to adopt it as an accepted method of payment. 
If we assume each bitcoin user had $200 worth, that would be 10,500 users globally. That would make it pointless for establishments to adopt bitcoin even if every single owner lived in New York City. If you said to an owner of a restaurant or a store in NYC: "Hey, I want you to go out of your way to set up a way for people to spend this alternative internet money here, but there are only about 10,000 of them in the city and they each only have about $200," that business owner would correctly tell you stop bothering him.
The total value of bitcoin when it stabilizes is absolutely essential to its long-term success as a stable currency. Unless bitcoin's value grows to the size of at least a few trillion dollars (something like 100k-300k per coin), we won't see it become mainstream globally at all.
Unless I'm missing something? Someone care to explain it if so?

that's a pretty rude thing to say in an employment market like this. Don't forget how severely unfair the job market is to people who are at the bottom and want to climb -- skills and qualifications are mostly accessible only through huge loans which are unlikely to pay off with a well-paying job.
In a fair and equitable society, it is a shame to be poor. An an unfair and unequitable society, it is a shame to be rich. We have the most unfair, unequitable society we've ever seen. It's a lot harder than you think to get out of the minimum wage rut.
