Personally, I would use Coinbase to setup a daily buy of $50. That way you would dollar cost average over the next 2 months.

Gold is definitely used as a store of value, but it does have industrial use.
The current price is a consequence of both the industrial use cases AND its speculative value when considered a store of value.

The ~~dotcom~~ crypto bubble occurred in the late ~~1990s~~ 2010s and was characterized by a rapid rise in equity markets fueled by investments in ~~Internet~~ blockchain-based companies.
I am a believer in cryptos, but there will definitely be a bubble from over-investing in the next few years.

Why isn't the price of bitcoin set by the cost to mine a coin? Am I looking at this backwards?
Supply will grow with price because more people will mine if the price increases.

Ah right. The total prize per day is fixed. Got it.

You are going to get stupid answers because this appears to be a stupid question at the current state of bitcoin.
BUT once bitcoin is big enough, the amount of coins that are "lost" will be an important factor in pricing. Give it a couple years and someone will do an analysis on the number of addresses that are inactive. They will come up with a ballpark figure from that and analysts/investors will use that number to determine the value of bitcoins with the lost coins considered.

Based on an extremely rough guess at mining costs, $900-$1000 is around the break even point for profits at the halved reward.
This number could change greatly dependent on adoption (aka demand). I wonder if there are any adoption models that closely match bitcoin to this point?

"The number of bitcoin that will ever be issued is capped at 1 billion. Today there are about 15 million. In the year 2140, there’ll be 100 billion."
Who writes this garbage?

"The mission of the FBI is to protect and defend the United States against terrorist and foreign intelligence threats, to uphold and enforce the criminal laws of the United States, and to provide leadership and criminal justice services to federal, state, municipal, and international agencies and partners; and to perform these responsibilities in a manner that is responsive to the needs of the public and is faithful to the Constitution of the United States."
Are they faithful to the Constitution of the United States?

I find this extremely interesting actually. The end game of Bitcoin will be global usage verified by servers taking transaction fees to stay profitable.
This actually caps the value of Bitcoin and ties it to physical assets (hardware and electricity costs). You could make a really rough estimate of the "final" Bitcoin price if you could first estimate the maximum transaction fee people are willing to accept. 
Again this is assuming global usage for currency and many other probably weak assumptions. Still, this is the first time I've thought about a theoretical max value for Bitcoin.

Do you see a situation where bitcoin is $10,000 and you would rather have fiat? 
What purpose and value does the fiat have at that point?

I don't think you understand how to use the word risk.
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:20:09
Risk is inherent in everything. Asking if there is a risk to bitcoin is a silly question because there is risk to everything. 
A better question would be, are the risks associated with bitcoin worth the reward? This is called risk analysis.

Free market at work! In theory, whoever can product electricity most cheaply will do so, achieving the the lowest cost to society. This helps with the issue of energy transportation. Very interesting.

We are on the same team. Crypto has the potential to disrupt the current banking structure.

1 cookie for $2....oh don't forget the transaction fee of $4 or else you have to wait hours for your transaction to get processed by a miner.
Bitcoin is a speculative store of value at the moment. It's not a very good currency, yet. Microtransactions are not a thing yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:01:28
You can easily sell 200 BTC (1.8 mil) on GDAX. The 24H BTC/USD volume on GDAX is $215,321,000.
You need to contact GDAX first, but they will facilitate. You will then need to tell your bank that you will be depositing a large amount from investments. Don't mention bitcoin.
The real question is....why would you cash out all 1.6 mil? Then what? You need to talk to a financial advisor. 1.6 mil needs managed.

Bitcoin is not working great for microtransactions. It's expensive and slow. What cool-aid are you drinking? Maybe you are comparing bitcoin to something like western union? If so, then yes, bitcoin is lightening fast and cheap. If you compare bitcoin to visa, it's prehistorically slow.
Bitcoin does 300,000 transactions per day.
Visa does 150 million transactions per day. 
ps I hold BTC. I believe in crypto. I just think we need to be honest with what BTC looks like right now.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:52:22
Spent $10 to send BTC in around 2 hours (6 confirmations).
You won't be buying coffee with BTC for a long time.

I hate the argument that gold/diamonds are worth so much because of their industry uses. There value would be 5% of what it is today with just industry use cases.

You are actually predicting a drop after the fork?!? How bold.
