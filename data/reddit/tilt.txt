He's right. If bitcoin hits a mil, that doesn't mean milk will go to $100.

No worries :)


No - you then combine privkeypart with your private key in order to create the actual key to spend it. bitaddress.org can do that for you too.
It's because the stuff vanitygen generates (in this mode anyway) is not actually a full key pair, it's only half a key. So I never know the full key.

But to be honest it's not that much trouble to just download vanitygen yourself and run it locally, assuming you're running mac or linux.

Yeah I used to understand this stuff a lot more a few years ago but all I really remember is vague handwaving stuff so all I can say is: it works! More info here

vanitygen on the commandline is fine if you build it from a trusted source. Any online service is also absolutely safe IF you use a split-key vanity address.

No it's the public key. You can't reverse engineer the private key from the public so there's no trouble there.
Better explanation:


The idea is, that you can generate a vanity address without even knowing what private key it will actually belong to. One party grabs a random ECDSA keypair and saves the private key for themselves. They later can issue a request for a vanity address to be created, by supplying the public key form that keypair, their desired pattern and so forth. A person takes with looking for the vanity address is required to brute force random ECDSA private keys, get their corresponding public keys, add them to the provided public key, and proceed normally with SHA, RIPEMD and base58 until they receive the desired pattern. Then they give the private key they found to the first person, which adds the two private keys in order to get their vanity address. The best thing about it - the person looking for the solution won't know what the resulting private key is! This means that you can outsource your vanity key generation without needing to trust any third party.

Holy JPEG compression!

No, if you use a split-key generator then there's no way they can spend your coins. Essentially, you create a key pair and supply them with the public key. That is enough for them to generate a vanity address for you but the fun part is that there's no possible way for anyone to use that vanity address without BOTH the key they generate and the private part of the key you generated. So no, an online generator that uses split keys is totally secure even if it's compromised.

Example: You want an address that starts 1hash, so you go to bitaddress.org and generate a key pair on the vanity address tab
You record the private key and send the public key to me:


I then run vanitygen on my machine with that as a piece of the key, looking for addresses starting 1hash


I then send you the resulting address details:


Address: 1hashj4a76E9YF3Whw5dQhqGGmhvXvruU


Now it's only possible to actually access that wallet with both the PrivkeyPart that I know AND the private key that only you know.

When I first read about brainwallets I thought it would be trivial to write a bot that continually watches for common phrases/words/etc and sucks up all the coins sent to them - I'd be hugely surprised if this doesn't already happen.
This is a fascinating bit of detective work though. The change transactions theory seems plausible.
