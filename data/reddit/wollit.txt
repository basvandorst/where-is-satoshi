how does bitcoin remove need for trust when it comes to me deciding whether or not i want to meet you for a date or loan you my car or let you stay in my apartment?
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:09:39
thanks. understood.
so how do i go about making one. specifically if i create a vanity one, how do i get the checksum at the end to work?

super cool trailer.
looking forward to the full thing
@_date: 2013-06-24 14:38:59
one way of doing it is sending you payments equal to the transfer fee

we are not ready for primetime. the site is a holding page whilst we are in development. when the time is ready for launch, it will clearly explain who we are and what we are doing.
 - appreciate your feedback btw.
@_date: 2013-06-18 08:03:55
that's exactly why we're building wollit.com.

it's like having a little cash in one pocket so if you get mugged you can give them that and they won't ask you to open your other pockets where your main stash is
@_date: 2013-05-13 16:37:06
it's all done client-side. the app never has access or even touches your funds
@_date: 2013-06-18 10:14:35
care to elaborate?
@_date: 2013-06-04 20:56:07
tell me more please. how would you see it working?
@_date: 2013-06-04 09:41:49
am interested to understand more. can you expand?

losing wallets is unlikely as they are effectively just encrypted text files which can be backed-up in multiple places.
the issue (at least with hybrid wallets aka ones which do the heavy lifting in the browser using javascript) is that a user is fully responsible for their password and if they lose that it cannot be recovered.

we are far from using bitcoinD. all will be publicised soon. you should know a metric ton of work has gone into the backend of this thing. when we go into the developers who've helped out I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:46:49
thx. 
bet your ass we're going to build an app.
@_date: 2013-05-21 11:19:18
yup, we'll then get in touch directly.
@_date: 2013-05-13 19:19:37
quite a few, but we'd like to keep them quiet till we launch.
you can be assured though that it will be incredibly simple and versatile and a pleasure to use.

Hi everyone,
thanks for the comments.
1. wallets will be secured by passwords and not your social auth account details
2. wollit at no time has access to your private keys and therefore your bitcoins. everything is done verifiably on the front-end.
love to hear more feedback. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 13:16:48
wollit.com - will be launching soon.
@_date: 2013-05-13 16:14:52
it will do what it says on the tin. its still being cooked right now.
@_date: 2013-06-04 12:59:43
superb comment
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:28:56
will do.
prob a couple of days.
@_date: 2013-06-24 12:45:22
we will cover transactions fees. (to start with)
@_date: 2013-06-24 15:14:41
we didn't post the link.
@_date: 2013-06-24 12:17:10
agreed. we are on it
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:51:45
true true.
hybrid ewallets are the future.
users don't need to go anywhere near the blockchain
