Not sure if you visited the link, but there is definitely more than 1 online.
I checked now, the following are up and running (at least there is no indication of otherwise):
- CAMBARE LTD (238 Graham Rd)
- Welcome News (you mentioned in OP)
- N1 Mailbox (275 New N Rd) - check with operator before, it is online, but was reported sometimes to have issues due to non-stable internet
- Smokers Paradise (351 Green Lanes)
- Mail Plus More (42 Watford Way)
- Fuckoffee (167 Bermondsey Street) - one user reported some issues during process, but generally machine is working.

I think the closest to your needs is Netcoins 
They have an app for iPhone or iPad, which could be used by retail store cashiers to sell bitcoins.
Depending on your location -- they could cover legal aspect of operating such a business as well.
Michael Vogel is owner, probably can come up with details PS
But generally if you have a store and want to have a bitcoin ATM at your location - I think there will be existing operators who would be glad to put ATM at your location. You can pm me and I put you in contact with those in your area.

I'm not against segwit and think it is a big improvement, but I think your post itself is very biased and FUD to some extent.




No, segwit primarily was a work for sidechains. Eric Lombrozo mentions it explicitly at the very start of [EB117 episode]( (3:30). Here is the quote from him: "He [Pieter Wuille] had been working on segregated witness idea for the sidechains stuff they've been doing with Blockstream".




I think the main concern from opposing side is that softwork here will lead that part of the network will be useless with respect to new transaction type, as they could not validate them. You don't address this issue in your post.




It's not only about lines of code in the client, it is about upgrading the whole ecosystem of bitcoin, as all the participants will need to update their software on their own, which is a huge work compared to just updating the bitcoin node client. All exchanges, payment processors, wallet providers etc. will need to make updates to their software. Do you think these updates will be similar in work-hours equivalent compared to 2Mb hard fork case for them?
@_date: 2016-04-11 14:43:18
Not many.
Normally they can ask for SMS verification via mobile. ID scan can be something at higher volume, e.g. when someone wants to buy $3000 per transaction.
Moreover, there are machines that still don't ask for any details, just cash in - bitcoins out. Most Lamassu machines work this way.
Check locations and types of machines at [coinatmradar.com]( For many machines details about verifications are also avaialble, e.g. recently added 
You see there in description:






So you can buy up to $800 without intrusive ID scan and your picture. Just phone.

Thanks for the link, interesting.
Can you ELI5 on the following:
Transaction with escrow is basically a postponed transaction. So if I got it right all three create a transaction with three R-hashes today where only 2 needed to put transaciton through lightning network, so it actually triggers when either sender/receiver agree or escrow reveals his R-hash.
But isn't there a problem that routing channel can be not found when actually transaction will need to occur? What happens in this case?
As far as I understood sender, escrow, receiver don't have to have direct channels open with each other, right?
@_date: 2016-04-04 06:47:50
Start with finding it on the map (e.g. [coinatmradar]( and check user's previous feedback (just to find some reliable info). You can check prices/limits there.
It was often the case that someone drove to a place and machine was not working. So if you're going to spend 5 hours to drive to it, I highly recommend call operator in advance and check if it is working fine.
How to buy bitcoins from bitcoin ATM varies depending on machine type, but here it is covered well: 
Regarding wallets - some machines can print generated on the fly address QR code, but it is recommended you have your own, e.g. installed on the phone, or you can just print QR code of your address, if you have it on your PC.

ok, clear. I was misled by your previous statement "sidechain elements alpha had just implemented the **hard-fork** version of segwit". Now you clarified that there could not be any fork at all as it was a brand new chain, which makes sense.


That is pretty obvious, but it doesn't make soft-fork a good solution for all the cases, it still has drawbacks. Also as mentioned by other redditors soft-forks are different and are not all the same. E.g. the comparison of segwit to P2SH doesn't make sense, as P2SH txns were supposed to be only part of the main bitcoin functionality and it is still a minority of transactions even today, however, segwit is supposed to cover the full range of all bitcoin transactions on the network very quickly.


Yes, but claiming something doesn't mean it will happen. In anyway, this is still a lot of work (more than in the case of the hard fork). This was my main point. I'm not saying they will not update at all, as it is pretty obvious that using segwit gives advantage at least from the fees point of view. So even if some wallet provider won't update users will just flow to another wallet, because there are economic incentives.


Totally agree here, but the main concern is when we need segwit. Malleability issue was there for a very long time and all already handle it somehow. Yes, fixing it at a protocol level is an important thing to do, but there are higher priority things to be addressed now, like the network txn processing capability.


All agreed, but doesn't address the main point of OP who said that segwit update is no more difficult than hard fork from the implementation point of view. I'm not discussing whether segwit is good or bad in general, I'm just addressing what OP wrote in his post.
@_date: 2016-04-01 12:00:20
I see. But probably it is not really relevant to the particular ones at coinatmradar. I mean it is for sure still not 100% perfect, but the availability issue I've been addressing very hard, because I was receiving complaints that people drove to location for couple hours to find out it is not working.
I did user feedback section for every machine listing, so anyone can now check the history of machine's availability from reports of other users and when it was available, also integration with manufacturers allows to track online status of machines better. The ones, which are not working get removed from the map.

Can you give any clue on what kind of extra regulation? Court cannot come up with their own regulation, so should be referring to some existing laws? So what was that in your case?

@_date: 2016-04-02 21:54:42
Well, to be honest US is the most leading country far ahead of others, so wouldn't feel it like this. Look at NY, there is bitlicense and it is top city wrt BTM number. Operators just follow those rules, it becomes more costly, but in the end most costs transfered to end users. So I think this could be the reason of higher average fees in the U.S. compared to rest countries 
(10.8% vs. 8%).
@_date: 2016-04-03 11:55:56


I see. That makes sense. Anyway, I agree that segwit is more a solution for malleability, rather than an update for addressing scaling issue.


I'm not very familiar with sidechain elements alpha,  can you bring a little more light on why segwit was done there via hard fork, not soft fork? And if it was testing of segwit, wasn't it more meaningful to test the same approach that is going to be deployed to mainnet?


I was addressing the concern about the trick that old nodes will assume new segwit transactions as any-one-can-spend transactions, that means they [old nodes] can not validate them, but just rely on miners, who included them in the block.


I was addressing the point of OP that segwit soft-fork and 2Mb hard-fork are basically about the same from development-resources point of view. Which they are definitely not.


According to your link. Many have backed the decision to do it, but have not done so, I see Ready=No almost for all of them. But the main idea is that it is a lot of work for all to update their software, whether it was done already, or is going to be done (which is the case for majority of ecosystem as of now).

I assume your origin country is not US, depends on where you plan to install it. I recently posted an article about using bitcoin ATM as a remittance tool  actually with arbitrage pricing it is possible at many destinations already.
So if there is any large remittance corridor from your country, or to your country (in case you want to install two-way machine) - it could be a good option to promote it like this. People can get immediate bonus when can send cash to cash at reduced price.
@_date: 2016-04-12 12:12:14
Sorry, I was not clear, I meant not the rules, but type of businesses that should follow these strict regulations. Court can not come up with strict regulations themselves and apply it to you only, they should be described in laws for somebody to follow them already. They just apply this same regulation to you, that is what you don't agree.
So who are the entities that should follow these strict regulation apart from bitcoin traders.

Depends on how operator checks it, some operators do check against databases, which means burner phone might be not accepted.

I don't know about particular case of comment author above, but the OP article describes a way to transfer money via bitcoin ATMs network.
Sender buys bitcoin at one bitcoin machine for cash (e.g. in Canada for CAD). Then sends bitcoins to recipient, and recipient sells bitcoin for cash (e.g. in US for USD). Finding bitcoin machines with low buy fee on one side and low sell fee on another side gives a way to create this remittance corridor, which is cheap and almost instant.
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:04:06


But could you give your thoughts why it should be otherwise? I mean in the U.S. it is normal that bitcoin ATM operator for example has AML/KYC compliance policy developed and follow those monitoring rules. I mean you can disagree with this, but for me it makes sense that somebody who trades bitcoins professionally should obey these laws.
I had a quick look at the link you provided and looks to be the company falls under § 3 (1) 5):


So the court assessed it differently then. What is the category the court put the company? 2) financial institutions?
I mean even if they assign 15000 limit to obey - it is still required to do due diligence even for smaller amounts, as they combined can lead to 15000, right?
Also regarding other European countries, it is really different everywhere, in Germany for example you can't run a bitcoin ATM unless you have some bank level similar licence from BaFin, that is why there are no bitcoin machines in Germany basically. So it is strict in other countries as well.
The good thing you still can do the business, it is just stricter conditions, but not forbidding it.

This scenario is well covered in the article.
There is even one more scenario, when sender buys bitcoin to his address, and then sends bitcoins directly to the recipient's bitcoin ATM address. In this case residual will stay in sender's bitcoin address.
With services like the one from BitAccess (when you deposit bitcoins online and then recipient just redeems the code for cash) it is even easier to do.
Generally, scenario 1 or 2 can be chosen depending on who is more technically advanced with bitcoin: sender or recipient.

You need to open channels on blockchain with time-restriction. So look at it as clearing and settling of transactions in advance. Even if the channel is used in full later.


They cannot be all locked, channels are cycling, there is still expiry time for every channel. So either locked bitcoin used in full during channel life, or they will be automatically settled.

You probably have not visited the site then. There is a very easy way to report machine as working or not. And due to this functionality many machines have been removed from the map and quality of data increased.

You say you submitted it to other resource and you don't want to submit to all different places. Can you please name the service where you have submitted data?

I didn't get the relation of the gas price example, I think it will be vice versa, when people stop driving, demand goes down, prices with same supply will go down, and then supply goes down probably to regulate the prices and find maximum profitability point for sellers.
But speaking about miner fees - I think it is better to look from perspective that miners sell their services to bitcoin users. They basically sell a service of confirmation and they have some fixed costs (hardware) and variable costs (electricity, rent), well and both those costs basically don't depend on how many transactions you include in the block. So I think another example might be more fitting here - wholesale price vs. retail price. If you sell something in big quantity - you can give discount to buyer, this is how it works as you get bigger volume and better turn over. Here is the same, the more transactions miner have to commit to block - the cheaper every transaction will be to end users. So, reducing the number of transactions (which will happen due to LNs as only settlement transactions will be on blockchain instead of every and each individual tnx) - then miner fees will be bigger, otherwise miners will just leave the market and network in general becomes less secure, which you probably also don't want to happen.
@_date: 2015-12-25 00:22:42
For me it looks like your scenario has flaws. This is exactly the issue which I don't understand in layman's terms (I'm def not an expert on LNs).


How this practically happens, when it takes 10 minutes to open a channel? So you come to Starbucks, stay in a queue, then when it's your turn you say you need to open a channel, basically do the transaction to open LN and then buy a coffee with your paper dollars, because you cannot use LN until it is confirmed on blockchain? Or you just stay aside an wait for 10 minutes, or 30-50 minutes, while other people are served?
I didn't understand your analogy to gift card, sorry.


I think this is not real plan for at least near future, Starbucks won't have any wallet, or open any channels with their employees. They will pay salaries in old good for them dollars. The most what can happen is that merchants including Starbucks might start use services like Bitpay to accept bitcoins, but that means they convert funds into fiat immediately, they don't poses any bitcoins, so they won't be able to open any channels.
I also don't understand what's the point of opening a channel by Starbucks with Sally for paycheck. They need to lock so much money without any reason there, when salary is paid - there is no need to get it immediately, Sally can wait for 1 hour (6-conf without any problem), simple onblockchain tnx will do the trick.
Say Sally gets $500 a week as a paycheck, so can you elaborate on the channel characteristics which Starbucks will have open with Sally in your example? Amount, reopening periodicity? I can't understand what for this channel is needed.


I understand, this is the idea how LN should work, but I don't see how it can be practically achieved, as such a sequence of participants won't be able to be built in practice.
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:57:08
Regarding the genesis machine you mentioned - if you click "Check online" you basically get online price which is the same as at bitcoin ATM, have you tried this before visiting machine / writing this post? Probably for BitAccess machines online pricing is also available. Which machines you mean? Looks like one is "Vape Supply Co" it is mentioned as 8-10%, but then you click "check online" and it is 20% buy and 5% sell. Another one probably "Henley Vaporium" - also online pricing is available.
Regarding incorrect fees - it is really hard to track how operators change stuff, and regarding this 15/18% you mentioned, it was reported by operator as 15%, although online prices indicated that the fee is actually about 17-18%, which I asked the operator and have not received the answer yet (machines were added recently).
Anyway, I'm working on some updates on the site, when fees field will be updated in almost online mode, of course, for those which provide feeds. So stay tuned, coinatmradar will do his job! I always vote for transparent information and sometimes struggling with operators about it. Also the base for calculating fees will be the same for everybody, as sometimes it is announced as small fee but then it is calculated on some strange feed which is already much higher than the market.
Stay tuned, soon will be some good updates to the site. New York machines mostly run by CoinBTM and they charge much higher than average fee, probably thank Lawsky for this.
@_date: 2015-12-29 08:36:42
LN is not a practical concept, nodes will be regulated by law as being money transmitters, no retail business will ever use it as it will require licenses which cost hundreds of thousands to obtain.
I'm not against LNs, I think it is nice concept and the more ways for circulating Bitcoin the better for users, but it simply can't be used as a scaling Bitcoin network instrument, it won't help Bitcoin to scale at all in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:56:06


I don't see logic here. As I mentioned above - there is no difference for miners how many transactions to put in a block - costs will stay the same. With your example about gas - it is totally different, you can not apply it here. 
So as a result of fewer transactions, miners will either increase fees in order to include into block - which is against your logic, or just close business, because they can't cover the running costs at same level of fees (because there are now fewer transactions). Which will lead to smaller miners number and hence centralization which is even worse.
So as a result of LN, we either have higher fees on blockchain or more centralized mining industry, even more than today's. I think both of them are quite bad for bitcoin economics.
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:21:45
You are concentrating on fixed costs, however, there are many other factors influencing price setting. E.g. as a localbitcoiner you are risking to meet someone you don't know - risk of robbery, risk of getting legal prosecution as you are conducting business without proper registration/license. So I would say different factors might equate each other in my opinion.
Also don't forget average bitcoin ATM fee now is about 7%.
Here is a short calculation:
- average bitcoin ATM volume - $30K per month
- 10% fee
- $5K cost of two-way machine (BitXatm), $3K cost of one way machine (General Bytes) (90% of volume now is buy bitcoin, not sell - so one-way might work good at current market state)
- serve machine yourself (grab cash periodically)
- find a friendly store to place your machine w/o rent in exchange for new customers traffic
You get $3K per month in gross profit, so basically it covers the cost of machine in 1 month (of course, this volume appears not immediately, but after 5-6 months).
If you did any business before, you know that ROI of 1 year is something normal, it can be 2-3 years if there are substantial investments.
Now assume you are an operator who launches 10 machines, let's make them Satoshi1 machines with cost $6K each. So you invest $60K for getting hardware.
Legal costs (not sure about U.S. laws as vary from state to state, know that some operators run machines in particular states by having bitcoins in hot wallet, so recognized as no money transmitters) - I'm not legal expert, but let's put $100K as initial legal costs for 1 state.
Now every place you rent for $500/month and have cash taking service for $2K per month to serve all your 10 machines.
Volume assumed still $30K/month (however, there are cases when monthly volume is $200K or more per machine - I know such operators).
So per year volume is $30K * 10 * 12 = $3.6Mio, your gross profit (10%) is $360K, after sharing 1% of turnover with Genesis Coin - you are left with $324K per year.
Initial costs = $60K (hardware) + $100K legal costs = $160K
Running costs = $2K + $0.5K = $2.5K * 12 months = $30K per year
So after year 1 you have $324 - $160 - $30 = $134K net profits or $10K per month, which is even enough to cover work of 2 people, one is you taking care about accounting and compliance, second guy - support.
Year two will bring you $324 - $30 = $294K or $24.5K per month, not bad. So even at very early market - bitcoin ATM business can be profitable at 10% for sure.
Now imagine what will happen if any kind of significant adoption happens? And you are already there with bitcoin ATMs at different locations and which run smoothly with established reputation.
Figures above are very rough, but I think reflect the reality.
So if you share your vision on figures to justify that 10% is too small - will be interesting to check it.
Edit: formatting.
@_date: 2015-12-20 18:59:09
Many info you can find at coinatmradar, here is some stats in a nutshell:
* Average volume you can expect in several month is $30K per month;
* Some operators reported spikes in volume trades recently Nov-Dec, some did even $10K per day(!) in turnover;
* I know some cases when machine brought like $15K in turnover over a year period, or about $1K per month only (hardly can cover even initial costs with average fees of about 6% now);
* Check your state's required legal status, running a bitcoin machine out of the legal field might end up in a lot of headache for you to say the least;
* You said you want to have a two-way machine, according to info from operators 90% of volume comes from buy operations only. However, during price fluctuations, e.g. recent price rise - volume of sales increases and became about 50/50 with buy volume. So may be target initially only buy volume (you can find one-way machine twice cheaper than two-way, so less to invest initially).
Concluding, it is a profitable business (even not taking into account additional traffic, which you can convert into sales if you install it at your business, some reported 10-20% sales increase). Many things depend on your approach to run the machine: promoting, good location, good support etc. If it doesn't bring you enough volume, don't try to jump to a new place immediately, normally it takes 4-6 months to reach normal volume (knowledge in society around it increases). If doesn't work - try to find a better place, probably you will understand after couple of months.

Onblockchain transactions are needed, LN can not function w/o them. The fees will be higher as you correctly pointed out to commenter above.
But isn't it a problem? Who in his mind will open channels for locked $10 paying for this opening of channel $1? So then the locked amount should be bigger in order to smooth the higher fees, say 100-200, which is a lot for locking I think, but even in this case it is kind of loss of 0.5-1% immediately in the network fees. Figures just made up by me, but generally you agree that fees will be higher than current 3-4 cents? And how big they will be - will depend on how LN will be used compared to onblockchain tnxs.
I see a contradiction here with LN in the way, that the more popular they become - the higher the network fees per transaction (because they pull tnxs from blockchain means the rest transactions have to compensate to miners in the form of higher fees), but the higher the fees - the less popular LN to be, because it is more expensive to open/reopen channels.
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:39:56


This is called market. The price (fee size) will just settle there where it will profitable. Obviously, with LNs this point will be higher than w/o LN.
Other "healthy" miners will not catch those "cheaper" tnxs, because it won't still be enough to become profitable. Only enthusiasts (who spend more than earn) could catch those transactions, as I mentioned, this is not healthy.


Many things related to oil is mostly politics, bad example. Also when did oil usage dropped? It was [always increasing]( as economies grow.
Can you give any reasoning why you think miner fee size will drop with introduction of LNs? I just can't get your logic here.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:41:04
I agree with you. Regarding $0.5K vs $5K for rent - yes, it's a minor mistake, I kept in mind $500 per location, so for 10 machines it will be $5K. Which reduces the gross profit by $54K per year, or $4.5K per month. But there is still a way to find a friendly business that will host machine for operator for free, in exchange for free publicity and some new traffic.
Regarding liquidity - yes, this totally jumped out of my mind when I briefly wrote it, and it is a valid argument. And the problem is not getting and freezing the capital itself, because it is assumed the investor has it, but as you mention providing liquidity to the customer in the environment of restricted relations with the bank.
But the capital required is not that big, if there is a way to consolidate the bitcoin source for all machines (bitcoin pot) then for 10 machines holding like $20K in bitcoin should be enough, with possibility to convert funds from fiat to BTC online, and replenishing BTC address. Of course, there should be much more capital in fiat currency at exchange or better several exchanges, but it is not subject to btc volatility risk. Basically you will need to have 2-3 days turnover of capital in operation in order to cover wire transfer period from your bank to exchange (so about $60-90K sitting on exchanges). In Europe this can be reduced of course, as SEPA payments delivered within the day or on the next day.
In general my assumption was that being a transparent and KYC/AML compliant business an operator should be able to find a bank, I mean if you can't find a bank which will accept your business model - then there is no way to run the show at all. Alternatively coins could be purchased from miners directly, but not sure how the cash is accepted on this market. As we see consolidation of bitcoin ATM business, e.g. more and more operators create networks of bitcoin ATMs, rather than machines run by individuals as was more a trend at the beginning, I assume there is a way to run this business and convert cash into bitcoins.
So in general your argument is two-point:
- on the decreasing price market (which was happening from the beginning of 2014 till now) operators due to holding liquidity in bitcoins lose value of funds and pass these costs to customers? Also putting the figures into perspective, if in the model above (10 machines) operator must have $20K in bitcoins, so even with two-fold fall of bitcoin price during a year operator loses $10K, which is 10K/3.6Mio = 0.0003%, I mean it looks to be totally not significant. Even if the bitcoin holdings should be $50K or $100K, it is still drop in the size of fees.
- second main argument is that it is hard to convert cash to bitcoin on regular basis, and operators pay 5-7% markup on this. I mean if this is the case, this increases the end fee for customers dramatically to 15-17% leaving 10% as net fee charged by operator, which some charge. But are these 5-7% justified? What kind of market players category charges that much on wholesale market?
You provide some valid reasoning, but the model of operating is still not clear. My assumption was of running a bitcoin ATM biz via bank, however, you say it is not possible long-term as account will be closed anyway.

This particular model is Satoshi1 which only allows to buy bitcoins, but there is now very similar Satoshi1 model with bill dispenser, where you can sell bitcoins as well. It is already live at other location.
Of course, there are many other bitcoin ATM types, some allow only buy bitcoins, however, many allow also sell bitcoins.

They will include transactions in the block with higher fees only, and reject low fees.


The same as now, transactions will stuck somewhere in the middle and not included in the blocks. The case is very theoretical, as there will always be someone who will ready to pay higher fees depending on the business case.


Economics, as I mentioned there are costs for being a miner and only those who accept tnxs with higher fees can be profitable and incentivized properly. I see what you are saying that there will always be some kind of enthusiasts who will burn their electricity and invest own money just to support bitcoin network. But I think this is so wrong to rely on this. In healthy approach - there should be clear incentives to be a miner, if you are relying only on enthusiasts - this will be a very weak network as there will definitely be not enough mining power to guarantee enough hashrate against attacks.

I mean it is clear that there is no practical implementation yet, but before implementing the stuff - at least there should be an example of how they can be used in real-life circumstances. Not in some vacuum sphere.
I mean for regulators it is just one step to create law, that if you want to be a node for LN, means payments are routed via you, you need to have money business license. Then believe me, no big registered companies will ever use LNs, clean bitcoin is much better as it allows for companies to work in a legal environment, where it is allowed. But trying to make a coffee shop to become a money transmitter - just doesn't make sense for me.

I thought to find something new on your list, but looks like you copied it from coinatmradar.
@_date: 2015-12-07 15:14:23
Here are just 2 posted only several days ago. So this kind of stories you mean?
@_date: 2015-12-22 08:36:55
I remember there was a Robocoin machine closed in Australia, because banks terminated relations, although the business was following all legal requirements and rules. Didn't know that exactly same picture is currently in North America.
I remember this FinCEN statement, but basically what you say is that it doesn't work and banks close accounts of MSBs without consider their business model anyway.
So what we get in the end with the bulk opearators (2nd group) is that end customers basically pay twice the fee, one is the localbitcoins and the other one by operator on top of it. So it is cheaper to get coins by meeting locabitcoiner, however, ATM gives advantage, the question is this advantage really worth that much higher fee?
I do understand the current state better now, however the model of repurchasing bitcoins from localbitcoiners seems very flawed to me, although it is only currently available opportunity as you say. Solutions could be:
- Unbanked bitcoin machine (when via price machine coordinates the demand and so keeps the constant amount of bitcoins and cash available over time). The problem is the demand and supply is limited to geo burdens and price discovery might not be efficient for particular ATMs. I think BTCPoint was working on some kind of unbanked functionality, but I think it ended up with nothing. What do you think about unbanked machine, is it real it could be helpful in this scenario?
- Having some cash eating business in parallel, e.g. Satoshi Citadel in Philippines have several business and for example they have bitcoin remittances, when for example money comes from abroad in the form of bitcoin and you need to cash out to local users. In this case bitcoin ATM business and remittances could co-exist, if the volume is about the same for both. Of course it will work in case it is more about incoming remittances, which is probably not the case for US. However, maybe there are other potential businesses which can eat cash. E.g. issuing payday loans in cash, and then customers will return via transfers. Or checks cash out services. I've seen many bitcoin ATMs are located at cash exchange offices, so it might work like this already.
I mean in general the current state of things is clear and it is understood where from the higher fees are coming, but again this problem looks flawed and should be resolved over time in some form. I also had an impression that getting cash instead of wire transfers was something advantageous to the bulk seller of bitcoins. E.g. if bitcoin ATM operator could find a miner who mines on wholesale level, then actually miner would be glad to sell bitcoins even at lower than market price for cash. At least, this was an argument by some operators, when basically the discussion was about shifting the fees to miner, from whom to purchase at low than market price and then sell bitcoins to customers at 0% (market rate).
I think over time it should get resolved in some form, because for now it seems to be very inefficient.


Don't agree here, statistically if you do regular purchases (say daily) of similar amounts all short term fluctuations won't matter, only long term will define a loss or profit for operator because of rate volatility. You provided an example when the price goes down for 5-10% quickly, but on opposite it could be the case when price goes up 5-10% quickly after bitcoin purchase. So one day will be exchange rate loss, another day will be additional margin when bitcoins price increased. The problem is only when price rises quickly - many bitcoin operators just stop operations, because it is more advantageous just to hold bitcoin funds, rather than sell and repurchase, because during this lag before repurchase price goes up again.
However, if the business is provided on regular basis only long term matters, and I mentioned price two-fold decrease, because this is what happened over 2014-15 (1000-&gt;500-&gt;250). But looks like there was some bottom touched at 200, hope for optimistic scenario here in the future.
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:28:56
OK, opening a channel from home like a card - makes sense. So actually you do this before coming to the shop. But still, I hardly see a real-life example when major retailers start using bitcoin directly, none of them do it today, so I think it is very optimistic that they will in any near future, till then - LN will work (if they will at all) only via individual channels or specialized companies.
But the main problem here is that if the end retailers are not going to use LN, then all this LN thing will be used by two friends sending money each other for a breakfast costs they split. So you will not be able to pay with bitcoin at Starbucks.
Also regulatory point of view, making it requiring to have money transmitter license, no retailer ever will use LNs. Do you see it is real that Starbucks will spend hundreds of thousands in order to facilitate LN payments? And every and each retailer will do this? Prepaid cards work just fine.
So I still don't see where LNs can be used practically, I mean it is easier to imagine that much more retailers use bitcoin with 0-conf and via payment processor with immediate conversion to bitcoin, but LNs just make adoption much more complicated.
Regarding hub "charging additional fee", so we invent another VISA or Mastercard, that will charge fee for doing payments (how much 1-2%?) and then also the fees on the main blockchain will also be increased. But then who is going to use a system which will cost more than current payments in legal tender?
I mean I understand the theoretical idea behind LN, but practically I don't see a way it can happen.
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:59:40
Working on this. Something similar to what you described will soon be added, at least with respect to fees.
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:58:49
LN at least according to description works like Alice pays to Bob through Carel. The route might be longer.
The idea is that if you want to pay for a coffee in a coffee shop, lets say Starbucks, that means Starbucks should participate in LN means have channels open with others.
So according to docs Starbucks should have also not only incoming channels, but also outgoing, in this case Alice can pay Bob via routing the payment through channels opened by Starbucks on both sides.
Just looking at the definition of [money transmitter]( - I assume Starbucks very well falls under description of money transmitter, that means regulators can easily force them to have a license in order to participate in this scheme. And this can be easily verified whether they use it or not. My point that no retailer in strong mind will pay hundred of thousands for getting these licenses across different states just to be able to participate in all this new LN thing and provide to a minor portion of their customers some convenience.
Look, bitcoin is not used by retailers directly, it is used at best by accepting payments via bitpay or other payment processors, so they get fiat in the end and don't touch bitcoin. Why one can think that they will jump on LN train at all? In the light of legal field restrictions, they will not do this in my opinion even if they wanted, because costs are too high.
And without retailers or any meaningful players, LN is just a small network between friends used to send small transfers, so argument that somebody will be able to pay for coffee with LN is a myth in my opinion based on above argumentation.
@_date: 2015-12-24 22:15:20
The core arguments which I agree (both mentioned in the post):


- Regulation is a pain, now bitcoin works without intermediaries. You send direct transactions and miners include them in the block. With lightning networks we talk about hubs be it big centralized organizations or individuals, but according to economic sense these participants are doing nothing than **transmitting money** from one user to the other one. There is a clear reason governments can come up and regulate it, saying if you want to do it - get money transmitter license first. Ok, the software is opensource and everybody can run, but will it be used as intended? I think sending couple of people to jail or apply huge fines for doing this in unlicensed way, an nobody else will want to do it.
- Another argument is about finding routing. So you are staying at Starbucks to buy a coffee, and when you are at cashier desk you try to pay via lightning network, and there is no route to pay to Starbucks. So you need to open a new channel, which will require on average 10 minutes for onblockchain transaction. Question 1 - will Starbucks be a part of lightning network at all? Question 2 - who thinks a cashier will wait 10 minutes where there are 5 people in a que behind? I see when people discuss cancellation of 0-conf transaction, they say - there will be lightning networks, we don't need 0-conf. I just don't see a practical way how lightning networks can replace 0-conf in such cases I described. Any help to understand it?

I responded to him above - but I think you are lacking info here.


There are basically two up-to-date sites only (coinatmradar and coindesk map). Not many as was mentioned. By running bitcoin ATM he should know this.


Specially to serve this I implemented voting functionality - which allows everybody to report machine as working or non-working through upvote or downvote - I can't imagine what can be easier. Here are details 


I provide public API with locations of ATMs. Can you elaborate how you envision collaboration? I'm just trying to do the job properly and keep the map as much up-to-date as possible. If somebody doesn't want to reveal information that his machine is relocated or off, there is no way for me to know about this. If you run a bitcoin ATM and care about your customers - I think it's not really a problem to submit info about your machine to several resources, which will cost you ... maybe 15 mins max? The problem looks totally imaginary to me.

It's a market price. That's even lower than localbitcoins users charge you, however, operators need to spend a lot in one-time and on-goings investments. Average worldwide fee for buy operations at bitcoin ATM is at 8% now. In the U.S. it is higher I believe.
@_date: 2016-03-09 08:50:09


You are misled here. We already have fee market. It works without RBF or anything. If those transactions are accepted and mined - that means market accepts them. When miners decide to raise minimum fee in order to include transaction into block because there is not enough bandwidth or storage - then these dust transactions will never end up in a block. So it doesn't necessary means that all this dust will be in the block when you raise block size. Also it doesn't mean blocks have to be full when you raise it. Say if 90% of mining power includes minimum fee conditions - then such dust can be settled only in 1 out of 10 blocks. In all the other 9 blocks there will be space left in the block (although there are dust transactions in mempool) they could be 1Mb for example in size out of 2MB, but all dust will wait in mempool. Also if there is 10% hashing power can accept them - it doesn't necessary means they will mine them, because they also have fee priority probably and there are other higher fee transactions will be there for every block 10.


Are you serious that you blindly believe whatever Luke-jr says? You talk about 2.1 mb connection you have, I assume it is 2.1 MBytes/s, not Mbits/s, right? Just go on and check yourself what will happen if you have internet 4 times worse. Just limit the bandwidth of your node. There is a new parameter ["maxuploadtarget"]( in Core 0.12 (I assume you run core). Limit it and see whether you can be a valuable node further. And I'm 100% confident you will be.
Even the Core team themselves recommend minimum of 144 blocks per day there, which is 144 MB now. To be able to provide this output you need to have 0.0016 MB/s connection upload speed (144/24/60/60), which is 1250 times smaller than your current connection. I simply don't get what leads you to think the way you think.
Now let's think a very useful node, and that blocks are 2MB and full, you set the goal to relay blocks for 8 other nodes (this is more than being useful for network in my view). There are 24*6 = 144 blocks mined per day. So you need to relay ~ 2MB*144*8 = 2.3 GB of data during 1 day, which results in 0.026MB/s speed, which is still 78 times smaller than your current internet connection speed.
**There is no centralization is going to happen because of bandwidth limitation of home nodes when you move to 2MB blocks.**


They are **already implemented** in alternative client. The speed I mentioned of 30-50 times improvement is the factual information based on observations of nodes running it, these are not theoretic calculations. There is a solid solution already working. The problem is that Core ignoring it for some reason, but I don't want to speculate on this topic.
So it is basically about pulling the code, verifying and testing it. Means 1-2 months and it can be easily used in Core client main net.


Can you clarify on this? Coinbase is running nodes already and I think they run many nodes. How it can attack bitcoin and why have not attacked before?


How can Coinbase add KYC/AML features to protocol? This is kind of FUD people drop. OK, if they hire several developers in order to push their vision into code (like blockstream is doing by the way). Bitcoin is open source, everybody will see, people will switch to other implementations, no one will support core, it is like changing 21 million cap. I don't see any reasonable way how any kind of KYC/AML can be included, it's just nonsense, sorry. Do you have any more details on this?


This is not serious. You compare the temporary patch, which Satoshi introduced (which even was not a part of protocol) to compare with 21 Million cap which is the core idea of Bitcoin? That it is totally out of the loop I think. I mean it is used by some as FUD to make hot discussions. But it is so irrelevant. Also when you say changes, ok, there are technical things like protocol, but there is also economics and ecosystem. Core, by not removing this temporary patch limit, is making much bigger change to be honest.


They were mostly all supporting bigger blocks, at least 2 MB for sure. See report from Toomim. But then were frighten, and pushed to step back, like on this last meeting in Hong Kong, which is actually kind of absurd in my vision. People say blockstream is not controlling developers, but then miners want Back to sign as president of blockstream instead of individual. They come up with a roadmap, which is not an official roadmap of core (roadmap over roadmap). So that means there is a big chance that this agreement won't be hold on core's side, because very few from core (Todd and Luke-jr only) were there. I mean, this is exactly what is ruining reputation of core team. And then you say something about Mike or Gavin. I've never seen Gavin involved in any shady tactics like I see permanently from lately from some of Core team.


No, it is far from reality. See calculation above.

I'm running coinatmradar and just published an article on the stats in the U.S.: 
There you can find that New York and Chicago are two most concentrated areas with respect to bitcoin ATMs number. And this is mostly due to two big operators in both regions - CoinBTM in NY and Red Leaf in Chicago.
I hardly can make any conclusion from your census map as well. I think it doesn't really make sense to connect bitcoin machine locations to race/nationality of people living there. Well, at least from NY map I don't see any correlation.
With respect to profitability, CoinBTM has 33 locations now on my map (I think 1-2 are pending, as I saw them via API), and they mostly have Satoshi1 machines (not Genesis1), so it is ~$6.5K (I think they have discount on this volume)*33~$200K invested.
Average machine has about $20-30K volume per month nowadays. And CoinBTM charges about 18% on buy operations now (from BitcoinAverage) - check prices of all NY machines here 
So it is ~$25K * 33 * 0.18 = $150K gross profit per month. Assuming the volume is lower for each machine as there are pretty many close to each other, but thinking about ROI period of 6 months - they will need to have $200K/6/33/0.18 = $5K volume of one machine per month - and this is more than realistic. I know some operators have machines which bring $100-200K volume per month for 1 machine.
CoinBTM did rollout over time one by one and not just investing six-figures amount at a time, probably by financing new machines from previous earnings. Although I think 18% is quite high, but on the other hand if there is demand then the business model is very neat in this particular case.

Let's try to look at real figures:


You are wrong here. And I don't say there were no spam transactions, there were. But go to tradeblock and check what is really happening, but not read the FUD on the internet from both sides of debates. Just check it yourself:
This is an average weekly block size taken with 4 weeks moving average to smooth the chart. Spam transactions are not consistent over long time (month is definitely long enough that is why 4 weeks moving average was taken). So basically this chart shows the real demand for block size.
You will see that in **3-4 months** from now with same trend blocks will be full and it will be not because of spam. Look a little bit further than today, just not to make rush decisions later and think about. Segwit will be there quite soon, but adoption will take some time, highly probable more than 3-4 months. Also in order for segwit to take its full effect (1.7x improvement or about) - all transaction have to switch to segwit, which probably will happen not less than in a year or later. Of course, sky is not falling - as basically it will be reflected in substantially higher fees (much bigger than during small spam flood we've seen recently). It's going to be really harsh times if we don't act accordingly now. You can wait and see how it goes, but then in summer say **if fee rises to $2 per 500 Byte transaction - is it some normal scenario which you think is ok?** I don't and won't like it to happen.


Spam - yes, but it is also the best way to fight against its users, especially new ones. Also you don't understand that fee market is not panacea, the problem is not that you need to pay higher fee (however, if it is $2 per tnx it is also a huge problem), but that you can't be sure unless you pay much higher than average fee.
Also it is some logic flaw I think - when you make a payment, you want to pay, period. You don't want to play with fees, e.g. send a payment now, then 30 minutes later check it and update it with higher fee, track it again later and update fees again. That's why RBF has flaw in itself, because it was promoted as something to be used in a normal scenario, but it actually should be a solution for emergency situations only, which should occur not more than in 1-2% of cases, otherwise UX is very spoiled.
Wallets can do a better job I agree and we saw that many lack a simple fee calculation feature, but again as I said before - fees won't be able to be predicted accurately when there are fluctuations in artificially restricted conditions (small block).


Where do you even get these figures? You definitely cook it wrong. With 2 Mbit/s (or 0.25 MB/s) internet connection (which is like 20 times slower than average) you can support up to **~150MB blocks** (check what is extreme thin blocks, which are already implemented). That means theoretically (taking into account only bandwidth restriction) - blocks of 1Gb and more can be supported today already assuming the bandwidth is used over 10 minutes for transactions transferring evenly and then only small diff is sent when block is found and propagated. So move from 1Mb to 2Mb is not an issue at all here. was doing tests without relay networks or extreme thin blocks and 4Mb blocks were not posing any issues. With extreme thinblocks the capacity grew 50x times. So if we have segwit + 2Mb block size increase - total 4 Mb - there is absolutely no problem with bandwidth limitation. You and your internet will be just fine for sure if you run a node yourself.


As you see - no disaster, sky is not falling again. Using centralization argument in an already centralized mining environment with moving to potentially centralized LN in the future is quite not right to be honest. Also you do understand that miners will still need to use the same bandwidth as today with segwit, they will simply be paid less in fees for that, because segwit transactions are counted with discount. Only SPV nodes win like you and me, but it won't be worse than today for sure.

I never told that the issue is traffic. I said GMaxwell meant 12% traffic improvement (link you mentioned about blocksonly), and I said this figure is not relevant because it is about traffic, but not internet speed (bandwidth). With respect to speed - thinblocks give a huge improvement for average node, and this is what matters, not traffic reduction.
@_date: 2016-03-16 14:09:39


This is the figure of improvement with respect to **traffic** over 10 minutes intervals assumed by gmaxwell. However, what I mean and provided an example before to you, there is an improvement for internet speed required to run a node of 5x times at least, which is far more than 12%.
Blocksonly - might be useful only if you want to become not useful for network and stop relaying transactions. I mean there are use-cases for this, but hardly it is even close comparable to what thinblocks do. Because they are limiting functionality of nodes, thinblocks on contrary is an improvement in all aspects for majority of the node network.

But you do realize that receiver (merchant) in majority of cases now and in the future is and will be using bitpay or any other payment processing service, for which receiver doesn't have access to private keys?
Immediate refund from merchant looks impossible in real life because of this.
@_date: 2016-01-08 12:39:04


Just following up on your full quote from previous post:


* the problem is that the market situation is exactly the opposite as receivers want to honor 0-conf, this is the root of the issue
* Also transaction happens without attitude of the merchant to it. Obviously exaggerated example will be that merchant accepts bitcoin payment as done when there are 6 confirmations. Does it mean that when there are 3 confirmation the transaction "hasn't happened"? I don't think this is the proper perspective to view at this. Also the issue of all discussions is that RBF supporters say that 0-conf are insecure and could not be used by businesses, which generally states 0-conf = "transaction hasn't happened", this is why I responded in that way. The reality shows it is not like this.


The problem is not actually about default. The problem is that with intro of RBF in the way it is suggested by Peter - it will totally change the risks, which merchants face today. And this will result in many businesses just shut down the opportunity to pay with bitcoins because of this. It brings much more incentives to double spend, because it is much easier now. I think whenever it will be released in April, many people will specially go to brick-n-store merchants and try to double spend.
In general you have many valid points, and probably if at all RBF will be included in current form, market will find a way to live further, software will be rewritten supporting tries of RBF double spends. But why all this mess is dropped to the market is still unclear to me. Argumentation about more secure and robust system doesn't make sense. The only reasonable explanation is if the block size stays limited and there is no space for all transactions, then there will be a nightmare as too many transactions will get stuck and something needs to be done with this.
But blocksize limit is an artificial limit (it is a different debate), hopefully it will be done differently then current road map, also I still believe FSS-RBF is better choice. If someone wants to push the transaction, he/she will find a way to add inputs to the wallet (and in many cases additional inputs will be there already). The solution is that it will become possible in a predictable way to unlock funds, now there is no ruled way to do this.

I didn't mention this obvious conclusion in my post because it is the logic against LNs. This is actually the only way I see LN can evolve in real-life scenario. But then you have the problem of centralization, so you get another VISA and Mastercard in the form of Bitpay and Coinbase. This is something all of the proponents of LN says will not happen and accepted by all that it is a bad scenario.
This is mentioned here 
*"My main concern from the beginning was that, as a hub-and-spoke payment layer, there would be very few hubs and the network would be quasi-centralized and a regulatory sitting duck."* You just made the same conclusion.


In case of nodes - transaction don't go through address/balance of miner (it goes from user1 address to user2 address directly). In case of LN - transaction goes through LN node opened channels on both sides, this very similar in logic to being a correspondent bank in an international payment (series of bank-to-bank connections).


I was not talking about IPs.
Simple example: there are 2 agents, agent1 with established connections in LN, agent2 - brand new user. Now agent2 opens **the only** channel with public LN node, say Starbucks. And makes a payment to agent1. If payment is done via LN - this is a proof that Starbucks was used as a financial intermediary for this transaction. Busted. There is no technical possibility it to happen differently.
Now I do a control order of drugs online in the same way, and it just proves that Starbucks facilitates illegal drug purchases. I don't know how to more clearly explain this to you. You can talk about tors etc, but LN is totally different from bitcoin with respect that **you need to know with whom you open the first leg channel**, and this is the point of privacy failure here.


**Bidirectional Payment Channels**
OK, the name I used was wrong, forget about unidirectional, this is BS, you are right, however the core argument is valid, and you were so rushing to call the whole point BS that probably didn't read till the end. I just repeat it for you:


Biderictional channels are basically the ones with a multisig initial transaction (correct me if I'm wrong again, but this is not the main point) where both parties participate in the inputs. Now can you give a simple use case how all those ordinary bitcoin holders / users will get incoming channels, in case of bidrectional form or not?
As it is easy to open channels in the direction of aggregation (from small users to big public players, like bitpay), I don't see a path down to simple users again. I just can think of salaries paid in bitcoin by companies via LN to employees (but LN doesn't make sense for salaries to be honest due to redundantly big frozen funds), plus this won't happen in 5 years from now for sure. What are other use cases you can come up with?


I know you understand the difference very clearly. Only nodes who verify signatures will use the same bandwidth, same as with plain increase of cap to 2Mb, all the rest will not test this scenario.


That is your imagination replaced the words I used. I said **cap** has to be adjusted accordingly. With proposal like the one from bitpay, there is a cap present and it is not an artificial limit, but market driven limit.
If you repeat "Core’s plan is better" twenty times it won't become better. I have nothing against core plan if it was logically justified to be a solution to the problems which exist now. Segwit postpones the issue of today for a year, and then we are here again. I see a tendency when some participants claime they will fork the core client, which I think will be a huge problem for bitcoin. But instead of addressing issues, you (proponents of core plan) just call everybody who raises any concern against it stupid and arguments BS. This definitely "helps" to resolve the tensions.

Well I agree that bigger share of empty blocks compared to other pools might indicate something, but the idea itself is not contradicting. They mine empty ones in order to maximize profit, so not to work on invalid blocks, and hence no hash power is wasted. Why at the same time they can't be pro for increasing block size, because the ecosystem reached a point when there is not enough space for transactions? All is logically correct here.
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:38:26


Are you talking about relaying of tnxs or blocks here?
Can link to source where these figures are taken from?


Agree, so I'm stuck with internet speed requirements I have now. And in case block size increases, I'm as a home node runner - will think twice whether I can run it as it takes too much bandwidth. However, thinblocks solve this issue for me and for thousands of other nodes.


What do you mean by limited? Yes, every improvement is limited. Segwit is limited by a factor of 1.7x or so, but don't you want to have it because it's limited? And also probably I miss something here, why can't miners continue to use relay networks, while the rest majority of the network use thinblocks?


Can you clarify here? I don't see latency an issue for an average node, especially when the problem is internet bandwidth, not latency. What is average ping time - 20ms, thinblocks do like 4-5 interactions, so it is 100ms in latency + some additional calculation on the node sides - which I never saw mentioned as an issue.
What is the latency figures you are talking about and why is it a problem as it is probably minuscule?

The argument used is that with extra input (FSS RBF) it gets bigger than with rewrite of transaction (opt-in RBF or full RBF) - I never said that "unconfirmed transactions take space in block".


In order to make transaction RBFable later in opt-in RBF concept - you explicitly mark such transactions with a flag on the client side. If it is not - it is similar to plain old 0-conf and can't be rewritten by default, unless miner decides to do this on his own as it happens now.


It looks like totally on opposite, this is you who has no idea but just decided to put your two cents here.

Although price of device got better, shipping is still kind of crazy and illogical, $50 for 3-5 days delivery and $75 for 6-10 days delivery to Europe (the longer it takes the more you pay, ah?). Also for this price I probably can get a wide screen TV delivered, not a device which fits into the pocket.
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:31:32
So to put things in perspective, you did say 3 purchases, $30 each and paid with 3 transactions by spending 15c as fees. And then they reissue you 1 transaction which is a grouping of previous ones and you pay only 5c instead, so you basically saved 10c on $100 order. Which is like 0.1%.
PS I still believe majority put things in the cart and make one order, rather than making several checkouts in a row.
Hardly this example can be a justification for RBF.
@_date: 2016-03-16 12:42:00


I see that you mean something else under latency, because above I definitely was not categorizing as a latency, maybe except CPU usage, but again not for block validation task, but for some operations needed for exchanging data for thin blocks can fall under latency.


Well, if you can't load a block within 10 minutes time - I think you should care, because you will become further and further past the network.
What I meant is that internet channel of home users is limited and thinblocks give a huge improvement to this part of network, which is majority of nodes I assume.
@_date: 2016-03-11 08:43:52


Yes, you can check it. Dust is not settled on blockchain. You probably mean transactions which were flooding network recently - they were not dust. They were normal transactions with high enough fees.
I just checked addresses from the video  this one 1CMqRknGWyzbHFQeezorHhF1jc6ret5s43 for example, and you see that all these transactions paid 0.0001 BTC (~4c or ~45s atoshi per byte) in fees. When I said dust I mentioned 1-10 satoshi/byte. I don't see any reason they won't be included. But these types of transactions can't be generated to fill the whole 1MB extra space as you clearly understand, otherwise someone will have to spend a fortune on this. Dust is not included in the blockchain already. If you say it is and on massive scale - will be glad to check your proof.


Will be glad to check it, do you have link? The blockchain link you gave about orphan rates - doesn't go to history well, only recent blocks are there.
When I used 1% I was addressing to P.Rizum presentation. And basically the logic of propagation time increases with block size, and hence orphan rate increase.
However, giving another thought - I agree it might be a valid argument that with improved tech, e.g. extreme thinblocks - there is no necessity to transfer the whole block, so that dependency may become much weaker, while generally the logic should hold true. Genuinely interested in stats of orphaning over time here, if you can share - will be good.


If the current version of the blockchain (with not spent outputs) should be stored on all nodes agree, I don't agree that the past history should be stored on as many as possible. This is very similar to segwit, when you and I won't download and store signatures, but some will. My main idea here was that attack you are afraid that someone will fill the block is meaningless, because this data can be dropped out and not impede network to grow.


This is totally different case. The analogy is exactly with central planning of government as they influence the whole ecosystem. Also what do you mean central planning by participants, it's just business planning. Coinbase and Bitpay already doing this. Don't get your analogy here. What the devs are doing now is very similar what the gov in soviet union did for example, when they decided how much food and clothes people needed pretending they know what the market demand is, you know what the result was in the end.


Well, this is crazy argument I would say. This is like saying if you don't like what gov is doing in your country - you are always free to go to another country. But if you'd like to live in the country where you were born? But just with a different government?


We can speculate a lot about as well as core devs can. They may say lightning network won't be centralized, but in the end it is possible that all nodes of lightning network can be run by financial institutions only. Is your argument that while it is potentially possible - we should not implement lightning networks now?


I agree that node requirements grow, but my personal feeling that prices for hardware fall at least at same rate. Right now 250Gb SSD costs about $80, which I think is not a big deal and will be enough for couple years for sure.
Regarding internet - you can limit nodes connected, you can limit bandwidth used by node, so I think now there are many inbuild tools, which allow to run node at home w/o issues.


Yes, agree in general. But there is no proof in your lines that regular people won't be able to run nodes in case block size limit is increased to 2 MB.




Don't agree. If core against moderation, they can leave this subreddit from posting here, for example. But it obviously that they are not against, as it makes life easier for them by reducing competition. I mean, you can different opinion, but it is quite obvious to many.


Nope. It will be implemented anyway, it was added to core roadmap without any major discussion consensus. I agree that it is a good improvement to network, but it is not in the scope of scaling solutions. Also the fact that segwit was developed for blockstream purposes, but not for the better of bitcoin shows the whole problem.
@_date: 2016-03-04 10:22:18
That is totally fine behavior currently and yes, it is already included in the protocol logic. With halvings happening the most financial benefit will come from transaction fees, not reward, so miners will most likely include transactions, otherwise they don't get paid enough and there is no incentive to mine empty blocks in the future.

Those are not "bitcoin ATMs", but traditional bank ATMs, which dispense cash by just entering a code w/o a card. Although bitcoin service provider integrated selling bitcoin for cash over those machines doesn't make them bitcoin ATMs.
Btw they are also listed on the map when you click "Other cash services" in the filter. There many more thousands of other services in different countries, and many are still not listed as don't provide API for locations (like libertyX in the U.S.). So buying and selling bitcoin for cash is now really becomes quite easy, the only restricting factor is fees.

Not really a lot. Assuming 0.11.2 and above update on both clients we will have more than 5K nodes at least. Some older ones will also update, some Classic ones probably drop out, but in general that will have no big effect on decentralization and number of nodes compared to what we had before Classic.
@_date: 2016-03-18 12:14:34
Thanks for response.


Blockchain is a ledger. If someone uses it e.g. to store info about copyright, e.g. hash of the article by sending a small transaction and paying accepted by miners fee, why not to store 5 cent transaction? Nor me nor you can decide what people should do. This is called permissionless ledger. If it is accepted by some miner - then it has to be in the ledger.
If there are sidechains in the future specifically designed for this - then ok. But usage onchain should not be restricted, if it is accepted by network participants.


Looks like the stats on orphaned is pretty stable, so my assumption was wrong. That means in case there are dust txns, and miners will fill 2MB blocks fully - the only factor stopping this scneario are costs associated with such an attack.
Also given thinblocks, and Gavin's header first mining - orphan rate probably will go much lower than today, so that makes my argument even weaker.


Some nodes who decides to do this, for which traffic and storage is not a problem. Your point here is that there is not much incentive - no one will store it and it will be lost?


This is in theory, as you see in practice a small group of people controls how it is going to work. Although potentially it can be changed, like government can be overthrown, it doesn't mean central planning is not happening.


The difference is not big, many people also left Soviet Union for better life in other countries. I think it is a strange argument that people can flock away from bitcoin. I would rather prefer as more people use bitcoin as possible, means coming from other cryptocurrencies to bitcoin. Also what do you mean by free market? There were black markets (free markets) back in dates, where stuff was sold at higher price due to deficit in the shops, that is very similar to the free "fee market" we are pushed hard now, when people have to pay more for the same transactions compared to the free state, when there is no limit.


That is definitely true. But my point was that if I don't want to leave my country where I was born, why should I? It's not about how difficult to do this.


LN are trustless similar to bitcoin. I don't fully understand about what kind of trust you talk. My argument was not about the size of transactions, but about the entities participating in the networking. E.g. legal requirements may push LN nodes to have licenses, or economies of scale, or requirement to have a lot of funds to open many channels will incentivize nodes of LN to become bigger - hence centralized (similar like mining did). So my point was - that there is real potential that nodes of LN might become centralized, but this is not an argument to not build LN, right? Similar to onchain scaling.


There is no much risk as all calculations and tests show it. Also I agree that there is no sense to risk - if there is any other good alternative. Here we disugree, because I don't find segwit a good scaling solution given current market circumstances. LN is too far from being a solution today.


Hardly an argument with number of active users just twice smaller in alternative sub. The reach of audience will be absolutely the same.


Well classic people were not invited. Also the ones who wanted to attend were rejected because "no place left". I'm very interested to hear who in your opinion was presenting opposing opinion there? The list of members signed underneath the decision you can find on medium article. I'll help you - none was.


Well, I agree with this. But then these are just shady tactics to push and force others to do something. If you're find with this - I don't. The problem of this private meeting is that they decided not on private matters, but on public ones.

What do you mean by bitcoin operators? I have barely heard about DDOS attack on the whole network of nodes at the same time. Do you have a link?


I disagree with this. They have very good economic incentive not to act according to majority best interest. Explained before that price of bitcoin is not the main factor.

Again, I didn't say in my initial statement that DDoS attacked are organized by anyone from Core team, that was misunderstanding. However, I do believe it is connected to core in the way that it is someone who supports core is doing this. Quite a substantial argument. At least similar as the moderation on reddit for example, as the core team says they have nothing to do with moderation and can't influence it.


Fair enough. Shift to Classic is not of the same value probably as was shift from potential weakness of the system. I mean it is obvious from slush pool voting, when 80% of all miners simply didn't vote. It shows that miners are basically reluctant here.


I didn't pay attention to "Hearn" parts in your comments because as I mentioned above I don't find it relevant. I don't support XT in any way.
If you have any thoughts/proofs on issues with Classic (like this KYC/AML you mentioned or blacklisting) apart from the fact that Gavin is the same person that was working on XT is now working on Classic - let's discuss.


This relates to the short term dust tnx flood which happened recently and already stopped. It has nothing to do with long term growth speed I provided link to and based my calculations upon.


What do you mean by price is not growing? If you say it fell from $1000 in Dec 2013 to $400 now, I will answer it grew from $100 in Aug 2013 to $400 now, or it grew from $200 in Sep 2015 to $400 now.
Also there are many other factors apart from adoption, which influence price, like market manipulation as liquidity and market is very small. Also the whole impediment and uncertainty now which happens for long time already is influencing it. When the block issue is resolved, e.g. core adds increase, or classic takes majority - price will grow.
Just as a final remark. I think core team is misleading public in many ways. One of this is "contentious hard fork". Why not for example to include hard fork condition when hash rate reaches 95% (against 75% in Classic) with say similar 28 days to activate.
That means 95% of miners will already switch to bigger blocks software + during 28 days most of this 5% left will also switch. But even if they don't switch immediately because they don't read news or abandoned mining equipment (hard to believe), the fork is not contentious anymore. If you can comment on this - will be glad to hear as I see you are pro-core. There is so much FUD coming from their side. If it was fair reasoning of their agenda - I think much more people will support them, but the more I read the more I see how inflexible they are and just want to stick with their plan even if it's worse for the majority of the network both short and long term.
@_date: 2016-03-14 13:42:50
Running a node using blocksonly is like running a mining node without signatures verification when segwit is implemented. It is cutting node functionality out. On the contraty, xtreme thinblocks leave absolutely the same functionality and value of nodes for the network they have now, but increase performance manifold at the same time.
You can't even compare the two, because thinblocks are much better for the network by definition, irrespective of bandwidth improvement.
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:25:08


Yes, additional input is required and this is not more due to privacy concern, however more to immutability requirement of outputs in FSS. Network basically doesn't know whether you reduce output for change address or merchant payment destination address, that is why the only way to add inputs and outputs as well. Yes, it slightly increases the size of the transaction (no estimation how big), also the idea is that any transaction can be marked as RBF (even when there are no more additional inputs in the wallet now), however, when you actually issue RBF replacement - you need to add inputs. I don't see any problem. If somebody got stuck transaction - he will find a way to get additional input in his wallet to fix the transaction. But in most cases it is not needed, if the block space capacity allows to accurately predict/calculate required fee.
Also when wallet is used quite often - there will be no lack of inputs. It is more a problem for a first user. But as I said RBFs should not be used a lot, in my opinion it is an instrument to push stuck transaction, which never happened to me for example. Other people want to artificially restrict space in block and then you really need some more broadly used instrument to push all of them. But this is very flawed logic and basically kills user experience, as you need to monitor all your transactions and then reissue again and again with higher fees.


Where did you get this "transaction hasn't happened". Transaction happened from the very moment when it is seen by the network. It is just about the probabilities that it will be mined and stay in the longest blockchain. The same applies when 1 confirmation is received - there is basically no guranatee that this transaction will not end in orphaned block and be canceled. From this perspective (probabilistic approach) - 0-conf is a very valid concept.


Your example is so narrow applicable. First of all you can agree to meet, and then wait with a guy to receive finally 3 confs. One solution.
Also the first confirmation might happen in 5 minutes (you can't cancel it anymore), but then next two confirmations might be postponed by the network, e.g. 1 hour.
Also if the guy agrees to 0-conf, you can sell another coins to him directly from your wallet and use LBC balance later for different purpose.
There are so many factors, that this possibility to cancel transaction until next block mined (which by the way may happen in 2 minutes and there is no time to receive any response) is really very tiny.
Moreover, you just mentioned that another guy can agree for 0-conf, but basically with RBFs this will not be possible anymore. So if you meet someone to exchange - you will always need to sit together until it is confirmed. And it may take even an hour or more. Otherwise, the seller can easily cancel transaction and buyer left w/o cash and w/o bitcoins.
So your example in my opinion is excactly against RBFs, as 0-conf are much more valuable in your use case.


I'm also not really defending 0-confs, I just compare the two and for me it looks that RBF is totally breaking current business matters and doesn't add anything valuable, only headache for everybody.


My opinion this is something bitcoin should not be left to happen. At least for now there are clear opportunities to fix it. Later some new technologies could make it even better. Like year ago nobody thought about segwit. Now it is a really cool improvement including the optimization of block space. Those artificially limits imposed are just working against bitcoin.
This looks a bit crazy how unpopular decisions are being forced by a small group of people. Interesting to see how bitcoin will overcome this centralization problem. And it basically should. This is why we are all so inspired by this new technology.

@_date: 2016-03-10 09:27:45
Let me go one by one:


This is myth spread mostly by Peter Todd for RBF pushing. Miners won't include them. Economic incentives are exactly opposite.
Right now orphan rate is about 1%, increasing the block size (in case it's full) to 2 MB will raise the orphan rate to at least to 2%, I assume more as it's probably should not be linear growth. So when miners include dust transactions - they earn fee from these tnx, and they loose on orphaning 1% difference from total reward (which is block reward + fees without dust).
If you look at what are the average fees: 
It grew from 100mBTC to 350mBTC in beginning of 2016, let's take 250mBTC as average. That means on average miners earn 25.25 BTC now per mined block.
Now what are the dust tnx fee to take 1MB, usually that are in lowest 1-10 satoshi per byte interval (see  let's assume even the maximum 10 sartoshi/Byte is used by them, that means for 1MB it will be 0.1BTC (which is $40 per block or $6K per day, which I find stupid to spend money on such attack, but let's assume someone do this long term, losing just $180K per month for adding redundant 4.3GB of data in blockchain per month - all this extra space will easily be removed by pruning, because dust transactions as you said go through many payments but return to the same address). Anyway, let's continue with calculation here. So if miners include dust transactions they will earn 0.1BTC, now if they implement minimum fee and not include they will not lose 25.25*1%=0.25BTC (1% comes from the fact that their blocks will be orphaning much fewer times). Economic incentives strongly say not to include them, because it is 0.15BTC per block more profits for miners. This is exactly what happened when miners stopped mining small satoshi dice transactions assuming they were dust. Hope it is pretty obvious for you now, that it is not to be decided by central planning, rather market should by itself decide what is dust and whether it to be included in blocks.


Yes. And my assumption is not an assumption anymore. This is exactly how extreme thinblocks work on mainnet already. Instead of sending the whole 1MB block when it is found, nodes just send missing transacitons, which is about 20KB instead (30-50 times improvement), and can be neglected in the overall bandwidth. So the whole data is transferred now evenly over 10 minutes. The fact the core team ignores this improvement doesn't mean anything. That's their choice and they have other priorities. But it can easily be done, it is already done and working in other client.
Also even if you talk about propagating full 1MB over 30 seconds for 8 other nodes (which is not relevant anymore), that is still 0.26MB/s speed required, which is 10 times smaller than your figure. Where this 2.1MB/s speed comes from? Can you provide calculation behind?


This is not relevant. Let's talk about real life rather than imaginary. You and I run nodes, so it is not possible for all nodes to be run by one central authority. Also this is not relevant to what we discuss at all, because the same scenario can happen if there are only Core client nodes. So what is your point here?


Please don't shift to Mike Hearn, he has no relation to Classic.
Also his blacklisting of tor exit nodes was due to massive DDoS attack coming mostly from tor nodes as far as I know, which was ruining the network growth. I didn't like his drama quit, but he did a lot for bitcoin over many years for free, you can't dismiss it. Again, let's not talk about Mike here, as it is not relevant to our discussion. If you have some concerns regarding Gavin (as he is mainly involved now) - then mention it, but please don't shift discussion to something else.


Right now there is nothing similar in Classic, development is transparent, you can check their roadmap.
Also switching to Classic now, doesn't mean you have to stick to it until death. If you don't like it - switch back to Core at any time or any other implementation which will be there. This is a basic freedom of choice. I don't understand why Core team is so hard against this freedom.


This is not correct. Segwit by itself is a huge change to bitcoin as well. Changes the data structure behind, the whole industry has to update software, economics are changed. I mean I'm not against segwit, just your argument doesn't hold. Hard fork doesn't necessarily means the change is bigger than what can be done via softwork. You understand that softwork like segwit can also split the blockchain and basically fork it, right?


Ah, this is far from reality. What do you mean by "without anyone paying attention". Discussion about block size is happening for 2-3 years, special events are organized with major industry players like recent round table, I don't think this can be called "without attention".


Very obvious, there was no Classic released by this time. When it was released core started playing the games, like organizing this closed door Hong Kong meeting where pushed miners with whatever arguments to stick with Core client. Although after this meeting even those who agreed to stay with core are very vocal publicly that Classic is the better choice. I think it is still about conservatism and hard switch to something else. Anyway, if they don't vote with their hash power, then it means that core is something that proposes more benefits to them.


Fully agree. Even more for example with extreme thinblocks it will be much easier to run node at home, however Maxwell is against it, pushing relay networks, which gives advantage to miners, but not to the rest of the network. This is really frustrating to be honest that such improvements, which can make life of ordinary users better, are just ignored.


I don't beleive this. I vote in similar way like those "vote brigading" based on content taking decision on my own. Does that mean I'm troll or doing brigade voting? No. For me this is a clear evidence this is not truth in general. The same way as Maxwell or LukeJr said about there were no DDoS attacks on alternative clients, said this is all imaginary. I run it myself and was attacked, now I know for sure they were lying. Also this all anti-core and pro-classic drama came exactly from this failed moderation. I think if it was done properly - then discussion were much more healthy and community would win a lot from this. However, what is done is done.


This is far from truth. It is not only about domain. This site or this reddit for long time was the place for fair and independent discussions of bitcoin. So the whole userbase was gathered and attracted by this, and then the policy suddenly changed.
But even from the names perspective bitcoin.org is much better than bitcoin.com. *.com are commercial domains basically used by companies operating for-profit, *.org is organization domain in general and is much more neutral with respect to profit.
Also you ignored my analogy with microsoft, I tried to make clear what I mean via similarity of situations.


I would agree with you if both platforms were existing from the same moment in history, which is obviously not. So it is very strange comparison then on your side.
@_date: 2016-01-06 08:05:25
The more I read the description you give - the more I understand it is against RBF, but not for it. You say miners, nodes are motivated by their own incentives and apply whatever rules they want still within scope of general consensus. So why give them RBF, let them maximize profits with 0-conf. This is exactly what they are doing now. Give it to the market to decide.
Also your reasoning about profits maximizing, it looks like RBF in the long term will lower profits, as you explained before, people will try to send low fee transactions first in order to check market and those transactions will end up in the block. I mean, at least it is not clear whether RBF will increase or decrease fees. Of course, if you artificially limit space in the block - prices will increase, but if the block increases and there are a lot of space for tnxs or it is improved in some other way like segwit or something else core devs come up later - fees will decrease.


Why you assume that RBF = higher fees? RBF are transactions which can be replaced later in a generally accepted algorithmic way, market detects the fees. As I mentioned miners can lose on RBFs and acceptance by miners of RBF is probably not due to incentive, but because it is included in the core client.


Yes, now I see when FSS-RBF won't work immediately.
I mean the very easy solution could be to have rules for FSS-RBF accepted by protocol and then not in all the cases a user is able to send RBF transaction (but it is easily fixable). Wallets will integrate it in software for showing warning message that this tnx can not be RBFed without additional actions, if the user still marks it as RBFable - then later he will need to organize it in some way as there is not enough inputs to send second transaction, e.g. send another payment to wallet or sweeps a new private key from cold storage.
I mean, I don't see it as any different from complexity for the ecosystem than full RBF itself. While FSS RBF can cause some issues to users of wallets only according to mentioned above scenario, which is easily fixable, full RBF causes problems to many more participants (users, merchants, etc). But the advantage of FSS RBF is the clear useful use case - to push your transaction when it is stuck, while for the full RBF - I still can't find a single use case, given that transaction can be totally reverted, changed etc.
So there are very clear rules which need to be fulfilled in order to use FSS RBF, who wants to use it - should follow rules. The good things are if you send transaction marked as RBF not fulfuilling the rules, you still can fix it later if you need. Because not all marked as RBF transctions are going to be changed later - I think it is totally fine scenario.
Agree with you, but this is way way too early to do this. Bitcoin miners will start rely on fees fully in 2140, which is more than in a hundred years from now. Till then theoretically mining can be covered by mining reward, which is halved but still present and it really depends on the bitcoin price, whether it is enough or not.


Fee market is already there, people know that tnx can get "stuck" and add higher fee. I agree that it will be useful to have some way to push forward "stuck" transactions, but full-RBF is not a proper tool for this, as it does not push transaciton forward, it basically overwrites it with whatever user wants ruining many business cases at the same time.


OK, but I don't see anything bad about it. You paid and you got it immediately. This is very cool user experience.
If you are honest user - it is great for you, you don't waste your time later to check whether your tnx is confirmed or not. You just ordered, paid and it's done. Probably if it is not confirmed - you will be contacted by operator, but in most cases it will be ok.
If you are fraud customer - it won't work for you, because you won't be able to board on plane or move into hotel - as you have not paid it properly.
So truly don't see any problem that it works like this. Moreover, I see a huge advantage for customers that it works like this.


Agree, but I can't find it reasonable enough argument to just eliminate those use cases. Not many people used it in bars and restaurants, but some did. So now basically nobody will be able to do this.

I think they claimed for a while already that bitcoin is "surrogate money", so basically yes.
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:44:00
It's not fully true.
Although the number of small fee transactions increased in the mempool - this should not change any confirmation time for other higher fee transactions if there is enough space for normal activity excluding spam.
Now look at coindesk article where fee prediction from 21.co was announced (20 days ago): [ and compare to similar screenshot from above - you will see that transactions that were confirming with 0-1 block are now forecasted to be confirmed with 2-18 blocks (21-30 satoshis) and basically the safe fee to get included in the next block increased from 21-30 to 41-50 per byte (2 times) over last 20 days.
People don't care about mempool (there is limit introduced in 0.12 and rest spam transactions will be dropped out of mempool), but the problem is that people pay as much fees as they did in the past and transactions don't get confirmed now, although before it was ok. It is not even about the size of fees, as there is no big difference between 4c and 8c for a business to pay (not talking about users here), but the problem is unreliability. E.g. customer purchases bitcoin from bitcoin ATM, and then he sees the next block got mined, but his pending transaction to receive bitcoins is still unconfirmed. It repeats with next block, then user panicks, tries to call support number of bitcoin ATM operator. They both try to figure it out... Aha, it was sent but fees are now not enough..
@_date: 2016-03-14 19:08:23
You are wrong. They have a big one. Transactions are sent over 10 minutes period approx evenly. This is not a problem for bandwidth at all. The main issue was for nodes to send out and propagate blocks quickly over the network when they are mined.
And this is where "-blocksonly" don't help you, however thinblocks is a huge advantage as shown in the video of saving of about 10x. When block is mined you as a node receive it and need to send to ~30 nodes quickly within 20-30 secs or so. If full block is needed to be sent (let's assume 1MB) - then  there is min required speed for your upload 1MB/sec. In case of thinblocks - connection of 100Kb/sec becomes enough for the same speed propagation of the blocks. I hardly can call this a "small effect".
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:10:47


The main difference in two double-spend scenarios as far as I understand is level of effort to be applied, while in case of 0-conf the only reasonable way to do double-spend is to issue a second transaction spending same bitcoins to a different address at approx same time as main transaction is made.
Also propagation should start from other side of the network, so that most nodes see the second transaction first, also later it depends which part of network mines the block first. Practically it becomes very difficult to do this, and doesn't worth an effort for 3 bucks coffee.
In case of RBF (again as far as I understand) there is a time till next block (10 minutes on average if transaction is done at the beginning of next finding) for the attacker to basically revert transaction. This is much easier and can be done even by a school boy. So you buy a coffee, go out and issue second transaction.
Accepting 0-conf and accepting full RBF transactions are two totally different risk scenarios for merchants. The only way to handle this is to not accept RBF at all for quick payments. But this really produces a lot of mess in case somebody does RBF disregard warning at cashier, or disregarding inclusion in merchant request that tnx should not be RBF.
I did pay with bitcoin in real-life and it was a little bit of a hassle for barista to do this via bitpay terminal. I think in the scenario of issued RBF, when it should not be an RBF, and barista would need to explain in some way that tnx can't be accepted because it is RBF - this looks to be very nasty. Also barista need to understand what RBF is in the first place, and this won't be the case in 95%.
I really try understand what for the full RBF is needed, what is the use-case and what problems it solves. Could you please help to understand in simple words?
@_date: 2016-03-14 19:11:03


Where do you get these statements from? Any proof for your words?
@_date: 2016-03-08 14:46:51


This was rough assumption, what is yours?
I was thinking about recent spam and we've seen 2x fees growth over a short period. Spam was taking about 40MB of mempool.
I was looking at the chart I provided a link, so let's assume now it is 800 Kb average growth of 50,60,70,80 next months. That means about three months later begining of June we reach 1Mb limit, then number of transactions continue to grow and in 1 month on average there will be demand for 1060 Kb blocks. That means mempool will grow and won't fall back like it did recently after spam finished. 60Kb overuse per block results in 8.6Mb mempool increase per day. Which means in 1 month we will have 258Mb sitting in mempool and growing. This is 6x worse than during last attack, so if during attack the fee increased 2 times, during the time when it gets worse over a month the fee will need to increase 12 times, which is probably $1 in case you assume 5c normal fee now. But in 1 month later it will be $2. Anyway, there are many factors, and you are right saying growth will simply slow down, so it is hard to predict proper fee size, but it will be for sure much higher than we've seen recently. So 10c transaction will be impossible.
Anyway, this is just assumption, but it can be better, it can be worse (much likely as it is increasing like snowball). In Core 0.12 they put 300 Mb limit for mempool, so they already estimated how bad things can become and how many transactions can stuck in mempool (and this for sure will be not spam).


This means by keeping the block small you artificially impede the bitcoin adoption and growth. Instead of growing further it will start to stagnate, because for many use-cases the fees will be just too high, have I understood your logic correctly? What's the point of this (artificially slow down bitcoin growth)? Also it is very strange when people talk about market, but operate in a non-market, but centrally planned conditions. If there is no limit on block size - then it is market, basically market will freely decide which fee is fair, in the conditions with 1Mb set it is not fee market in its full meaning, it is kind of forced fee market.


I think you are taking words out of context. It might be not ready e.g. because there is no easy way to use it for example, there is no easy way to purchase it, but definitely not because there is not enough space now for new users. Also I'm not talking about mass adoption, I just talk about not ruining what was already built over years. Bitcoin has a momentum and network effect, which can be lost.


If I can make a payment of 10c for 1c and all are happy including the whole infrastructure and storage, why not? There is 0-conf, which was killed by RBF, but is still alive. So you don't need to wait 10 mins for micro-payments, unless they are coming from Peter Todd, no one else is trying to double spend such payments.


He still believes that blocks of 500 Kb are more than enough. It is strange you cite him as his view is obviously far from reality as blocks are already 800 Kb on average. Also his argumentation is rather strange, he talks about 5Gb limit for mobile traffic, does that mean he is going to mine from his phone? On phone you use SPV wallet at max, you don't need to transfer data and operate as a node, you just get info about transactions you need. He is saying "which is just barely enough to leech on 1 MB blocks" and I say it will more than enough to leech on 2Mb blocks. This is what is called FUD, he gives some conclusion without giving calculation figures or any reasoning. Is there any proof for what he states?


Also you clearly have not read my comment and that there is implementation of extreme thinblocks already in production. He is taking about propagation of the full block every time it is found. And then I agree you need to propagate it several times in short while after it was found. But in case of extreme thinblocks - only propagation of transactions is taking most bandwidth and it is spread over the 10 mins period. When block is found you don't need to transfer this full block again, you only send missing transacitons to other nodes - which reality showed improves the speed by a factor of 30-50x. So his argumentation already outdated, bitcoin tech already stepped further.
I have provided a calculation for speed and blocksize - what is wrong in it or what don't you agree?
More over in latest client you can limit not only number of nodes connected, but the bandwidth usage, so again there is no issue at all to move to 2Mb now.

@_date: 2016-03-31 14:21:35
I also think it is quite high, but if it is that high - that means the market is at this level.
As a proof you can see that discounts on purchases via purse.io are also at about 20% level, which is generally the same as paying fees to operator.
Regarding driving an hour to machine to get pissed off because fees are too high, I think nowadays it is less a problem than before. At least on my site you can find online prices/fees level for most machines before visiting any location. Also you can call operator in advance to find what is the rate at machine. I don't think it is that big problem today.
In the blog post I mentioned above - you can see that worldwide average fee of all bitcoin ATMs is at 8% now, while in the U.S. average is at 10.8%. Yes, 17-18% is higher, but if it is set like this, that means it is most profitable for coinbtm, which you can hardly blame them for. I mean if you don't like it - simply don't use it and there are alternatives in NY.
Look, on the other hand they have 6 two-way machines and they charge 0.8% for selling bitcoins there, which is almost market rate and comparable to online exchanges, where you need to send much more info and wait much longer.
@_date: 2016-03-18 18:08:06
Almost. Of course, it is not possible to track every and each case immediately, but map is mostly up-to-date. Added user feedback for every location made the tracking process of closing bitcoin ATMs much easier.

Segwit activates at 75%, not 95%.
It will be a huge error to activate it at less than 50% hash power or even above 50%, e.g. 50-60%, because there will likely be same result as from hard fork - split of blockchains.

I think we are (at least I am), my core argument that there will be no that many transactions to fill the block size fully (I wrote about in my previous response and you have not addressed it). So basically whatever short-term maximization goal they have - they won't be able to increase it forever, it will go in hand with the economic activity. And this is in general I find good long term because the system scales with how much it is used.
Just couple remarks on your rest part (although as you mentioned it kind of becomes not relevant).


Why do you think they are not? I do believe in miners' smartness and market forces in general.

Then advise core team to reduce default nodes connected from 8 to 1, they definitely made a mistake there.
I can't believe you are serious with such statements. You either totally don't understand how networks work or just trolling. I think the second - so no sense to continue here.
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:20:59


But the problem as far as I understand - it doesn't not introduce anything to the merchants, who needs to accept payment immediately. They can't wait tnx to be included in the block due to business use case.
Basically, there was already a way not to rely on this security issue before - you simply wait for 1-confirmation. However, 1-confirmation is also not a guarantee that payment is successful.
Bitcoin is all about probabilities: you see a transaction on the network - there is some probability that payment will be successful. Next step - 1 block confirmation - probability of successful payment increases, then 2 confirmations - probability increases even more. So it is just the very first step of probable successful payment. Why don't you let the merchants decide whether they can take this risk and assess those probabilities by their own. I mean people can earn on this more than lose - this is how it is normally done. With RBF you simply take away the possibility for merchants to earn on this use case and I don't get why.
I mean to some extent I see the reasoning, but it should not result in total elimination of 0-conf. It is like banks should not give loans, because 5% of borrowers, don't repay, or Visa should not issue any cards, because credit card data can be stolen and somebody could misuse credit cards.
I agree with you that it is better to have a solution more secure, but then it should be provided first. Lightning networks is something can help here, but it can happen only in several years, not months as you write. And it is arguably whether it will fly at all (i honestly think regulation can be a deal breaker for LN). But people will be reverted from bitcoin today, because now they cannot make immediate payments.
Opt-in RBF confuses me, because:
- 0-conf are still there for those who want to use (basically that means it is still insecure)
- RBF cannot be a replacement for 0-conf, so basically the functionality of bitcoin is reduced for many merchants
Are there any examples that somebody lost a lot because of this (insecure 0-conf)? Because I only hear people complaining that their business is stopped because of this, and never heard any example that it brought any negative effect to someone. Do you know of such cases?

What's the point of changing amount/inputs/outputs?
Wasn't it a solution for "stuck" transactions? In this case it should be enough to issue similar transaction, but with higher fees in order to be included in the block with higher probability. Allowing changing everything looks to be a total mess and I can't really get the reasoning for this. Was it described somewhere like in a BIP?

Nice try with FUD about 476Kb 24H block size average - looks like Alex can't read a simple chart.
24H average dropped from 900k to 800k, what he is looking at is MA 7 chart (7H average). Taking into account many blocks are empty or are artificially limited by miners (500k, 750k, 950k) and should not be counted towards average it is pretty obvious that blocks are full and we have not that much time (~4 months according to previous weekly rate of growth) until collapse and "fee market" to skyrocket.
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:48:28
Is there any proof/study that there is normally no extra inputs available? Or this is just imaginary problem?
But even if there is no extra input address available, if transaction is stuck - you just add this input in order to push transaction. Problem solved.
In case you normally don't have stuck transactions - there is no real problem to make out of this. It will be the case of 0.1% of transactions or what? So FSS-RBF should be just fine for this purpose.
When you say transaction gets larger when you add extra input, just think about when all RBF=1 marked transactions are sent to awaiting 0-conf merchants and then are sent back / refunded - this just uses much more space of blocks comparing to simple 0-conf with extra inputs in case of FSS-RBF.
Your argumentation is not really persuading. Regarding privacy opt-in RBF is reducing privacy when it's used for several transactions collapsing as it reveals more information about sender. And this is mentioned as one of the use-cases of opt-in RBF.

What will be the reasoning to make blocks very small for miners?

But then what for RBF? Merchants should decide whether 0-confs are secure or not. And this decision can be done without RBFs. Introduction of RBF makes it a "must".


This is very hypothetical and only in theory. I mean with the same success one can argue that in theory 0-confs are fine as although it is possible to abuse system, adversarial users won't do this, e.g. because there is mitigation of risk (this is exactly the case in the link you provided, that guy was afraid to double spend at bitcoin ATM because there was physical opsec, probably camera or whatever).
Practice shows that 0-confs are secure to the extent it is required to conduct business.
I mean it is very similar as to say that private key in theory can be bruteforced, however, it is not practically possible and the whole bitcoin is built upon it.


If there is at least one case appear when it is a real problem - then it will be implemented very fast and everybody will be glad about it, however, now it is meaningless to add this and break a lot of useful use cases. It harms bitcoin much more, including in the future, as it creates an obstacle for bitcoin to grow.


They are not. They work just fine. It is imaginary problem to assume they are broken.


They can easily use what you think is "secure" by waiting for 1 confirmation, protocol already supports it. No need for RBF at all.


As all discussion shows RBF is not "better" and doesn't align with the system as it breaks its usage in many cases without anything in exchange.
I see your point. To be honest when I started digging into this RBF thing yesterday - I thought there is some motivation, but as of now I more and more understand full-RBF brings a lot of harm instead of helping at all.
Nobody could provide a single real-life use case when full-RBF actually helps or solves any problem. Shapeshift example which you used on opposite shows that there is a huge requirement for 0-confs to stay untouched. Looks like I made up my mind about this topic. Thanks for your help and trying to provide reasonable argumentation.

Ok, please correct me if I'm wrong. I have mycelium wallet, I go to ATM scan new spare address from my HD wallet and buy bitcoins, then they are sent from bitcoin ATM operator to this address. Doesn't it create a new input in my mycelium wallet, which can be used for FSS RBF?


Can you please elaborate that it was "completely unusable and not beneficial at all"? Where it was implemented and who gave this assessment?


I was referring to example of people arguing, that when merchant expects 0-conf and receives RBF transaction instead - then he just reverts it. As you can't simply ignore transaction (as it will still settle in the block later if nothing is done) - argument from RBF proponents was that bitpay or other payment processors will implement automatic refund to the payer with child pays for parent scheme in this case. This I call usage of block space for nothing, as there will be 2 transactions added with no economic result at all. If this will happen regularly - then you use blocks quite inefficiently.


There was a nice diagram on reddit (can't find it now). So the idea of RBF usage - it can basically collapse several transactions (if they are still unconfirmed) to one general transaction with many outputs, this is how space on block can be saved.
Say instead of A paying to B and C, and then C (previous change address) paying to D and E, you collapse two transactions and have A pays to B, D, E in one transaction.
Now if I paid somebody to A and via blockchain analysis I find that D belongs to Bitstamp from the first scheme I can not conclude for sure that person I know (owner of A) sent money to Bitpay, in case of collapsed transactions I know this for sure. This is privacy reduction.


opt-in RBF breaks currently used risk management control and basically restricts usage of immediate sales a lot, like shapeshift, buying coffee at cafe, selling small amount of bitcoins for cash in bitcoin ATM etc.

If you have a reliable userbase over time - then yes, but if you increase it - you never know whom you meet.


Agree. The whole point of bitcoin adoption is to make these people who don't care about tracking start using it. Which means other factors than pseudonymity incentivizes people to use vs. traditional fiat currency.


That is a very good rate of 2%, but probably due to high volume trades you do. I know more about figures like 10% fees, which makes it fully comparable to ATMs, but the volume is lower than yours, like $200. Bitcoin ATMs give an advantage that people can buy even $10 or 20$ of bitcoin, which you will hardly find someone on LBC agree to meet for such an amount.
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:17:49
1. Can you please link to his measurement?
2. Looks like you don't understand the issue here. The problem is not in the volume of data transferred (in MB), the problem is in the speed, it is also called bandwidth and usually measured in (Mbit|KB|MB)/sec.
Let's assume figures are right. So let the total volume of data transferred by a node over 10 minutes (tnxs + 1 block) is 100 MB. So 80% of data is transferred within 10 minutes (tnxs relayed approx evenly) - that's 80 MB. Now block is mined and 20% (block propagation) - 20 MB (say 1MB block to be sent to 20 other nodes) need to be relayed during 20-30 seconds after it was mined.
So that means required internet connection speed for tnxs = 80MB/10*60sec = 
0.13MB/sec, and speed required to relay 20% of traffic for blocks is 20MB/30sec = 0.66MB/sec.
So as you see even that tnxs take 80% of all traffic, they actually require bandwidth 5 times smaller than block propagation. This is exactly the problem xtreme blocks solve. They make block propagation bandwidth limitation is not a problem. They at least give an improvement of 5 times and making the next limit problem as tnxs propagation bandwidth limitation. But 0.13MB/sec upload is quite a low level internet connection - so that means it won't be a problem to run nodes, hence less centralized network.
I'll be very interested to hear your counterargument.
@_date: 2016-03-08 19:25:37


I already did in my previous responses. Segwit will start taking effect only in 3-4 months, so when the problem is already there according to my scenario. Fully it will take effect when all move to it (more than a year). So segwit will help you a little bit, but when it starts helping - there will already be a situation I described above. Also segwit is very limited it gives 1.7x or something depending on transactions types in its full effect, so aligning these two events - segwit will not be efficient to solve the problem we are going to see very soon. I mean it will create some improvement factor, e.g. 1.3x improvement after 3-4 months from now, but this won't be enough if you agree with growth I estimated.


I find this not relevant to be honest. These are two totally different scenarios: attack and normal state of system. If there is attack which raises the fees to $10 per transaction: 1) such attack will probably be very expensive (for what purpose somebody will do it?) 2) it will be easily mitigated if needed and if it spoils the system. If those transactions are just transactions with normal fees which you can't mitigate - then why do you call it attack it is just usage of the system on general terms? Miners will mine transactions and they will get paid for this job quite well.
Speaking about costs, if you assume to raise the fees to $10 the attacker needs probably to take out all transacitons up until $9 or something (just estimating), that means for "attacker" to take the full block (1Mb even) will cost ~ $10 * 0.5 * 1000 = $5K per block or $720K per day. Well if there is somebody willing to spend about $1 million per day for useless transactions - then I don't care about him. Let him do this, miners will be so glad and many more appear so that network will become very strong.
Let's speak or at least try to stick with some real life scenarios. I do agree that exaggerating things might show some effects, but doing real life estimations is much more relevant.


This is again not relevant. This is something we already have and will irrespective whether block size increased or not have in the future. Or you are trying to refer, that because of increase to 2Mb - nodes will become centralized to the same extent as banks and basically can decide whether you can have access to your funds or not, by for example not relaying your transaction? I think the latter doesn't make sense.


Exactly - I reached similar conclusion above.


I think you get me wrong. I'm not against segwit, nor LNs, nor sidechains, nor any other improvements anybody comes later with. Also raising block size to 2Mb doesn't necessarily says we will need to increase it to 4 or more later if it is not necessary. Let the system grow dynamically and generically with its speed. I'm quite certain that there will be improvements in the future, which we don't even think about today. But we need to solve the problem when it exists. You said before to other redditor, that why should they rush with solution, let them decide carefully. The issue with block size was discussed for 2-3 years already. The responsibility that is was not solved previously and left as it is fully lies on core team. If you follow the discussions - you see they were really kicking the can all the time giving different reasons which were addressed by others, but ignored by core or they came with some other reasons. Now you say bandwidth is the issue - it is not the issue with existing solution. The main mistake - core was not addressing it before. Whether it was done on purpose or due to lack of vision - let the conspiracy theorists decide. But we need to solve the problem which we have, there is no other way. My argument that segwit is not solving this issue short term. It should be segwit + 2Mb increase - this will give us at least 1 year of time to develop and integrate the rest solutions.
I started as totally neutral, but seeing what happens shifted me totally to block size increase side. Also the unprofessional behavior from core side - I think this is something, which is obvious to society and that is why many people are angry.
You say the system will be more centralized if there is increase to 2Mb - what do you mean exactly? We have now about 10 main mining pools (with 3 dominating and taking about 65% of hash power) today and about 6K nodes now. So what is your vision will happen next when the hard fork happen? There will be 2 pools left and 300 nodes left? What is the level of centralization you are so afraid of? In my vision - it won't change significantly at all +-10%. Just saying everything will centralize, this is very bad is saying nothing. We always have centralization/decentralization ratio, the main question is about the level of both, which is acceptable.


Bitcoin is also open source, but for some reason Core team believes it is not. They are saying they are so generous to allow others to use the code (gmaxwell), or they frighten everybody about the other implementations ("contentious hard fork", they will change PoW algo if miners switch to others etc). Linux exists in so many different forms, why can't bitcoin do the same?


Ah, don't agree with you. If it was so, then it's fine. But the attitude of core (blaming every and each who tries to diminish their power), blockage of discussion on main platforms, DDOS attacks... I hardly believe this is the fair environment to say that market rejected them. According to slush votes 90/10 is pro alternative implementation rather than Core. 90%, this is not even 50/50.


This is a myth, you can have both, don't need to sacrifice adoption, you won't lose decentralization. See my question about centralization level above.


Sure it does. The lack of nice interface is totally different from limitation of protocol. Also when did he say it? Do you have a link, I'd like to check context and date. Recently, Peter Todd was participating on Epicenter bitcoin show and was attacking Gavin out of nothing just putting some citations, when he was asked when Gaving said this, answered - don't remember, maybe somewhere in 2011. Gosh, this is such unprofessional. Please, don't follow same route.


It existed for long  time, it created class of merchants and it was working just fine. Then Peter came with his super vision. I mean it is pretty clear that they needed to have something like RBF due to future collapse, but RBF was definitely not a solution for double spends. I'm very glad it's going to be removed in alternative implementations. But this is a totally separate topic.


Who are these nodes? How many are there? What does it even mean "struggling". I launched a node on my old laptop with an average connection of about 4MB/s, got synchronized during 3 days and no issues running all the time, until DDOS started. There were 0 issues. Does he mean nodes on dial-up internet? Then probably they have issues, but you see how absurd such argument would be. This is again what I call FUD, making conclusion without having any proof or figures. LukeJr has so many FUD in his statements, that I would actually be careful whenever I see anything from him. E.g. his recent proposal to change difficulty calculation, because he expects number of miners will be only 50% after halving. Really?


I think Maxwell said it doesn't make sense as they already have relay networks. Also he was saying when they were not implemented that improvement will be not more than 15%, but it actually was 30-50 times. I was not reading him directly, just others discussing it. Anyway, I've never seen that it is going to be added to core client in such a way. IBLT probably is something similar which planned for maybe half-one year from now. But what for implementing this from scratch as there is already tested and production ready solution. I think this is actually a huge advantage to have many independent clients and teams. It will be exactly like linux development, but the core team is very resistant for some strange reason. Well, not strange - quite obvious, but definitely not accepted by many from community.

There is a huge flaw in your logic.
Just looking at figure from different perspective:
In the end of 2015 the average block was 0.6 Mb, now 2 months later it is 0.8 Mb, so 33% growth in 2 months, if same growth goes on:
    01.05.2016 we have 0.8*1.33 = 1.06 Mb
    01.07.2016 we have 1.06*1.33 = 1.41 Mb
    01.09.2016 we have 1.41*1.33 = 1.87 Mb
So your estimation of segwit improvement (1.6 Mb) can be exhausted somewhere in the end of August 2016 already.
I mean this is also kind of exaggeration and truth is somewhere in between, but just to show how your calculation based on period from 2009-2016 doesn't make sense (there was much smaller userbase till 2013 and in 2013 compared to now as well, also growth is not linear). Your estimation of 4 years to grow only up to 1.6 Mb block size is definitely far from reality.

You don't get it. What you say might be correct if you have only one node connected to you. Default is 8. Can be 20-30 on average. So instead of sending 30 MB, you now send 30*30kb ~1Mb. Just rough figures, but should be OK for you to understand the difference.
Upload speed is bottleneck, not download.

12% is misleading, it is about traffic, not bandwidth. Again traffic is not issue, speed is the issue. As I showed you above and you didn't argued - bandwidth requirement is reduced several times, which increases the potential number of nodes in the network a lot as people even with very slow internet still can run a decent node on the network.
@_date: 2016-01-10 21:08:39


In this video he address the "cautiousness" that block size increase should be addressed with. He suggests 2Mb as a temporarily first step solution in order to see what happens, because bandwidth will increase etc. For me it is that he is not talking about replacement of 2Mb that segwit is giving. Because segwit will increase only bandwith for those miners that will verify signatures as well, so this is a very tiny portion of market participants. He is more talking about hard forking in my understanding, when the block size will actually increase.


This was rough assumption and might be exaggeration to some extent, you are right. I was basing my assumption on 
I said 6 months after segwit, which planned to happen Q1 probably, so I meant 9 months from now or roughly end of 2016.
In June 2015 average block was about 0.4Mb, now is about 0.6Mb, so x1.5 increase over 6 months. Hence, the extrapolation mid 2016 ~ 0.9 Mb, end 2016 ~ 1.35Mb, mid 2017 ~ 2.03, and I think it is fair to say that the max limit should never meet the average, it should always be about 20% above at least, otherwise it is kind of collapse for bitcoin (I know you don't agree). 
So based on figures above it is about Q1 2017 when the 1Mb (effectively 2Mb w/ segwit) will become not enough. If there is any substantial growth in 2016 (and this definitely can happen because of segwit itself, halving etc) - then 2Mb can be not enough even earlier.
Many people talk about fee market development etc, but I agree with Bobby Lee in this video when he says that **"bitcoin is successful because adopters in general like it for what it is". And low fee transactions is one of these "what it is"** and very strong one. Someone said nobody promised transactions will be cheap forever, but I don't agree with this. They can be and this is one of the qualities of bitcoin that was mentioned all the time with respect to bitcoin. Do you really believe that someone in developed countries will use it in case tnx costs $5 to do? Will never happen, general public don't care about decentralization. If they can make a payment in SEPA network for 30c that will settle during the same day, then what for bitcoin is? Buying cannabis online or making donation to Assange? Very low fees is the core of bitcoin, and to some extent I agree with last bitpay article on blocksize that 0.04c is big and we should make it smaller. I mean for average person this is almost nothing, but if there is a way to make it lower - this will be a great move. Keeping bitcoin transactions almost free. This is possible, if there is no artificial barriers at least for now. When the tech is not reaching the speed of bitcoin - then we can face fee market develops, but the difference is that in this way we won't be able to do anything, now we can. And solutions like segwit achieve this, because it will basically make all transactions cheaper and we need to keep it like this.


Regarding segwit adoption, I also believe it will be adopted very quickly, and the reason is that old clients won't be able to verify "everyone can spend transactions", that means someone can easily create such a transaction, which old blocks will mine, but then the block will be orphaned, so it is a loss for miners. Other nodes also will need to take it careful, as otherwise someone can pretend to spend bitcoins from such an address, and they can't verify if it's true.
Anyway, my main point about what to do w/ 1Mb (effectively 2Mb w/ segwit) when it is not enough, if it doesn't happen in 6 months, will probably happen in 1.5 year. The main idea is that it will happen for sure sooner or later and we are in the same boat again.
There should be some solution. If it is not found - then hard fork with blocksize increase will be needed, at least 1-time in order to move even in some dynamic block size. And hard fork is needed to be announced in advance, e.g. 6 months before. So we are on the very edge here  wrt to terms.
You talk about other solutions:
- IBLT - as far as I understand bloom filters help save on the traffic sent between nodes during propagation, it has nothing to do with the block size. If there are transactions for more than 2Mb blocks on average and you have 2Mb cap - there is nothing IBLT can help you. You say we can increase cap by this time in more relaxed way because there is no pressure on bandwith increase, but according to current tests 2Mb now will also be just fine for example.
- Lightning networks - this is a far theory concept. If at all it will be implemented and caught by the market, it won't happen earlier than 4-5 years from now in my opinion + I have some considerations that LN won't work in real conditions in the way they are supposed to work according to white paper. The problem is regulation and money transfers licensing.
I see your point regarding trying other solutions first and if they don't work and limit is taken fully - go into slow hard fork blocksize increase, but I personally think this is not the best way. Why do you want to drop bitcoin market into chaos. Imagine if the fees increase and substantially, that will change and slow down bitcoin economy a lot, people won't use it like today. I mean, even sending to and from exchange will cost you more and you think twice before doing this, not speaking about all the other applications.
I think the problem is that after segwit there are no other solutions (LN is hardly believed to be) an cores are very reluctant on addressing this. I think if they come w/ clear plan to adopt bigger block size when this and this happens by this time - then the whole community will fall into peace. The core is doing great job, but ignoring the concern of the whole community looks to be not wise at all. I agree with you that segwit can short-term solve issue of the block size, but it is simply a black hole what happens next. And it is a very strange approach for a 7Bn thing.

Also it makes more sense to pay 10% from item price for delivery rather than 50-70%.

Yes, may be you are right.


You can do this in fair manner, like we discuss now listening to opposing arguments, you can do this in unfair manner like this meeting was, when obviously no opposing opinion was presented there. Also the whole thing that it was organized without public announcement show the type of tactics are used. If you are ok with it, sorry, I'm not.


Can't say anything here, have not seen that, but you might be right. I think again it is more like an hysteria now with anti-core attitude, which is of course bad. But my opinion that cores and moderation here is the main reason for this.


No, definitely not. They were accusing the posters on reddit about fake DDoS reports, that there was no attack happening at all. Here what google gives at top 


These are two different scenarios. 1) when domain belonged to them and they forgot to renew - that is their problem. 2) another one that somebody registers domain with name resembling trademark. Many sues are there in the courts. Even not the correct spelling 


No, nothing wrong with this.
I think you take it out of context. The convo was:
You said: The bottomline here is that you act like it's the combination of letters in the name that matter, instead of the actual content.
I said: I would agree with you if both platforms were existing from the same moment in history, which is obviously not.
Of course the later started platform can become more popular, nothing against this. But what I said about comparison here is that current subreddit have grown its userbase mostly when there was no crazy moderating policy, now by changing the horses they take the advantage of their users by pushing the agenda they want.


Any proof there was DDoS on core clients at the same *scale* as on Classic network?


No, I mentioned it above, core is vocal against moderation, but action-wise support it. Just restraining this sub by cores and saying they will return only in case the policy becomes fair, e.g. not saying that altclient is an altcoin, should be enough. Of course, it is much easier to say we can't do anything about it, because its theymos. Double standards in my opinion. They can influence the situation, but they don't want to.




Comparing the situation when one pool gets &gt; 50% (known 51% attack becomes possible) and the situation when we just choose what is the future of bitcoin (no threat to the network here) is like comparing change in 21 million cap and change in block size limit to me. So, no, I can't agree the situations are similar and motivation behind is also very different.


That is speculation, please don't do it. If you say so, then abandon core code as well, because it was tainted by Gavin according to your reasoning.


Then I misunderstood you. Can you link to the core devs analysis you mention of these long spam tnx chains being done for years that basically results in the tnx growth? I assumed that you were addressing to recent claims that the spike in transaction flood was related to some circulating transactions ending up at the same address that initiated them.


You ignored my second part of answer. Of course, price is not in 1:1 relation to tnx number. Like the spike in price in the end of 2013 is There are many more factors. But in general the market grows, userbase grows, price grows. This should hold and I think it holds when you look long term.


Sure they do. But the fact that you can move the market price with just few million dollars should tell you that you can move the price without any change behind e.g. tnx number growth.




Don't get your argument here. In the Hong Kong meeting Back and two other cores signed under the paper to increase the size to 2 Mb after segwit with activation in 1 year, because the fork is "contentious". What is the reasoning not to implement it with 95% acceptance threshold and faster activation time? By saying bitcoin is not a democracy, do you mean that small group should not care about the community and do whatever they think is better or is better for them?


But you agree that it is not only devs as well. I see your point and agree.


They for sure don't have bad intentions, however, their personal intentions might differ from moving to general society better state. Price of bitcoin might be high in both scenarios, when only corporations can use bitcoin network or when ordinary people can use it directly. There is much more than simply a price of bitcoin. Satoshi gave to us not an investment instrument that you can earn upon by investing in it and waiting the price to grow. He gave peer-2-peer permissionless and trustless digital cash. My view is that poor guy in India could sell his goods not only in his village, but abroad as well. And he doesn't have to go in a bank to beg to open account for this, which they won't open. He is free to establish it on his own.

But those orders you need to do within average 10 minutes, there is high probability you are already confirmed, e.g. ordered 1 item 2 minutes before block is mined and next one later. So RBF can't be used.
Also how often do you buy at amazon in such a way, 2-3 times a month? Which in the best scenario will save you 30c per month or a cup of coffee per year.
I'm really interested in seeing real use cases for RBF, but really struggling to find any. Asking people who are proponents, but nobody can give any clear example with obvious advantage for any business or user.

Shapeshift is exactly the example I used in another post.
They accept 0-conf again. If you ask why - the answer because they earn much more on immediate transactions (convenience for users) rather than their loss of 3 BTC reported by the guy at provided link.
They have some limits policy 
To reduce the risk. And here is the confirmation that they enabled 0-conf again 
Example of Shapeshift basically demonstrates why 0-conf is needed, rather than opposite.


I don't agree here, you can consistently steal, but amounts you steal are limited. And the better the company works - the less you can steal. However, the company earns much bigger amounts on other fair transactions. I would agree with you that 0-conf is an evil when 100% of customer user base are fraudsters, which I think you agree is not the case.
@_date: 2016-01-10 12:44:44
Thanks for such a detailed reply.
Here are my thoughts in short:
1) Your ideas make sense. What I don't like is the complexity, especially with split of fees for current coinbase transaction and future ones of other miners (if I understood it correctly). This basically changes the protocol quite substantially. Now it is very simple - you found a block = get reward 25 BTC + fees of your mined transactions, which go to your coinbase UTXO.
When you start to split - questions arise, which transactions' fees give to you as a miner, which leave for future, also who in the future will get it. This is quite complex even from logic, as well as implementation.
And in the basic way it adds "artificial restriction", similar to set 1MB limit now. Also flexcap which you mentioned in another post, which says - that for bigger blocks there should be higher difficulty is the same "artificial restriction". I mean they are not that restricting as 1mb limit, because they still allow to grow, however, they are disincetivising blocks to grow in non-natural way.
2) You look at current size of blocks mined in bitpay proposal as a "vote" (similar as in BIP 100), but I don't treat it like this. Median moving max block limit is just an extra space added above current average block in order to handle bigger/peak number of transaction, but normally the block size will be based on the current bitcoin economy requirements. It is like VISA processes bigger volume on black friday, so there will be a space for these short high-volume periods. So basically block size will settle itself at level of economic activity in bitcoin (number of transaction), leaving some space above it for extraordinary high volume. This is not something like in 6 weeks (bitpay puts 2 week median for increase) from now we will have 8Mb blocks, this will not happen because there are not so many transactions. You say you assume that there are enough transactions to fill the full limit of block - but I find this as a very inaccurate assumption, far from reality. Here I talk about natural economy growth.
Of course, there can be spam transactions (which can be easily solved by limits on min fees by miners), also the spam attack should happen over long period (in order for block limit to increase), which will be costly. That's why I think it makes sense to have these 2 weeks in bitpay proposal to increase, but this is point to discussion, because a balance to be found, as too long period - will make the limit not flexibly adjusted when needed. I think 2016 blocks from bitpay proposal are coming from the same period for difficulty recalculation.
Another artificial transactions peak could be because miners will include their own transactions in order to artificially increase block size, so to kill the competition. To be honest I understood this threat but only to small extent. Miners will have higher costs for storage, bandwidth. Also the propagation time will increase. One can say that miner can start mine next block immediately, because current big one still propagates and have an advantage because of this. But this is doubtful, as there is higher probability of orphaning, as someone can find smaller block and propagate faster at the same time. Also in the end response can be symmetric, as someone will be able to also find big block, hence making this miner in disadvantageous situation using same logic.
3) Maybe bitpay proposal is not ideal, but to my mind this is one of the best alternatives we have now described. I don't like artificial set of increases like BIP101 as it can go far beyond the market needs and then some attack might be executed (e.g. when block was increased to the size when technology has not evolved yet). However, the steady self-regulating size makes so much sense. Also the increases like 2-4-8 from Adam Back when he still suggested it - also doesn't make sense, as it is a temporary measure, it is just postponing it for several years, and then we are back to the problem again. Bitpay proposal makes it kind of fix forever, this will adjust in the future, like the difficulty adjusts now. So market grows, the block size limit will grow as well (hopefully technology will support it growth). If technology isn't that fast and makes it hard to run at that block size, there is still a way to limit this by miners simply by mining smaller blocks than max limit and in this case natural fee market will evolve, not the artificial fee market which is suggested now. And the majority of miners will route the best path.

What is the real life scenario when you're going to consolidate outgoing transactions before next confirmation?
What is the estimation of how much space can be freed up because of this?
Also I don't see any problem with using FSS-RBF for same purpose? Can you elaborate why it can't be used?




There are legitimate reason to cancel, but not the customer should decide about it.
Putting "undo" in the hands of a customer is a big misconception.
Also this is the exact example when 0-confs work fine, so even transaction has not hit any block, the ticket is already reserved for this user. So with RBF you stay at home celebrating that you can now undo transactions (which was always promoted as huge advantage of bitcoin against existing payment networks that transactions are not reversible), however with 0-confs you go to theater or fly for vacation :) I prefer to go on vacation, honestly.

I know that it is not 100% the case (although not clear how often it is a problem).


This is exactly what I meant, if you have not inputs - you just organize it (buy from ATM, get from exchange, ask a friend), but it is easily doable (adding input). Also this is needed in some very rare cases, when transaction is stuck. I use bitcoin for several years, and never had a tnx stuck.
In the end of the day it can be implemented as a feautre of wallets, when you click reserve for fees, and click a button when one output is split into two, and one change stays in the wallet just in case it is needed for FSS RBF.


When you say implemented and deployed - you mean FSS RBF? Can you give a hint where it was used, just want to check more details. I just raise concern that opt-in RBF also can use block space for no reason (refunds), it can reduce privacy with transactions collapsing, so it is not really better than FSS RBF from cons side, however, it is much worse than FSS RBF in the achieved goal side, as it ruins many things at the same time (eliminates many use cases, increase fraud potential).

Segwit is a cool thing, but totally not enough for scalability fix required by the market. It is actually solving different things, like malleability issue, adds script versioning which is great, but scaling is just a secondary advantage which comes with it and which is very very limited.
What will you do in half a year after segwit going into production (assuming it is live in Q1 2016), when even the reduced segwit transactions will eat out the whole 1 Mb block size?

Could you please explain in simple terms what problems RBF solves in it's implemented form? I'm not taking any for or against position, just genuinely tried to understand the use-cases by reading Peter Todd's desc, but could not find any.
I do understand it could be useful in order to facilitate "stuck" transactions, but in this case inputs and outputs from predecessor transaction should be present in unchanged form, just adding new ones for increased fees.
What for it is done in the way that transaction can be totally rewritten with a different transaction?

I don't know where your aggression comes from, I wanted to give my arguments, you give yours. If you think you're the smartest and nobody else can have any valuable input - then there is no point to discuss anything.
However, I try to put my thoughts one more time. I see that the most contradicting aspect is LN. Here are my thoughts why I think it won't be a solution for scalability:
Just to be clear. I think LN is a good idea and I have nothing against its implementation. However, I have concerns regarding its applicability in the form it is promoted to solve problems. There are several main points LN can fail in my view:
- **acceptance:** in order it to function in the way described - all participants need to become nodes of this system, means use bitcoin directly. After 7 years of bitcoin existence, have you seen merchants use bitcoin directly? They use bitpay, coinbase, but not bitcoin.
- **legal regulation:** IANAL, but I think there is a big difference of running a bitcoin node and being a LN node. When you are a LN node - you are part of the financial scheme. Bitcoin nodes are doing just calculation and confirmation of data, they are not establishing direct relationships with parties of transactions. LN nodes establish direct financial relations with other parties by opening channels and hence fall under money transfer regulation in my view (again this is just my concern and I'm not the lawer). I hope that it won't be the case, but I know how regulators can be crazy about such things. When you believe that some group of libertarians do whatever they want, it doesn't work like this with established businesses - no one will want to go through the hassle of sues and courts in order to prove that "LN node is the same as being a bitcoin node".
Another point here - is that it is hard to detect and prove you are running a bitcoin node, however, it is easy to detect you are part of the LN. This creates a pressure for business just not to be LN nodes. Without businesses on board you can use LN only for transfers between friends by opening direct channels with each other.


It is very different from the perspective that it operates with money transfers, but not just data transfers and hence different laws apply.
- **long-term:** when I say 4-5 years I don't mean technical implementation and availability, I mean usage. This echos the point made in "acceptance", but generally even if we imagine that all will jump on LNs, it is still not clear what is the current usage of bitcoin network, as there are some use cases which won't move to LN, like buying drugs online, or first acquiring of bitcoin from ATM for example. You can't use LNs for these. These are just two examples, but generally the point here is what part of all transactions can move to LN, and which never will due to nature of these transactions.
- **unidirectional channels usage:** This I find a flaw in the logic of LNs itself, maybe I just don't get it in someway, but I read white paper and many other stuff discussing pros and cons of LNs and still have not found any proof my concern is invalid. LNs work based on one-direction channels. That means if A opens channel with B, only A can pay B, but not B can pay A. Hence the obstacle for receiving payments for A. While it can be easy for a network to direct payments to big players, like well-established business (forgetting about issues I mentioned before, let's assume business are all-in LN), because they can publicly announce their LN ids and people can open channels with them in order to pay later, but there is a huge concern how these same people (small players) can receive payments. E.g. I'm a regular bitcoin user, but I have no clue who on earth will open a channel with me by locking his bitcoins in order to make regular payments to me in the future. Hence, I can't accept payments over LN in such a way as payment will never find a route to me and this reduces the usage of LNs a lot as even the transaction which potentially might be moved to LNs due to its nature will not be moved.
I'm really interested to hear reasonable arguments on above points, but not just saying that *"you are showing that you are not educated on this matter and are hoping to get away with simply parroting some talking points"*.


Just to be clear here, I didn't like BIP101 as it was far beyond the required by network volumes (not to mention technical requirements, e.g. issues raised in toomim presentation), however, I do like the latest bitpay proposal. Because it is self-regulating and can grow the network with respect to technology improvements and network volume requirements at the same time.


No, segwit does not do this. Even speaking about bandwidth usage these are two totally different scenarios - to use segwit with effective block size increase to 2Mb and to simply increase block size to 2Mb from 1Mb.


Agree, I'm not the one who is for the cap to be removed, it just has to be adjusted accordingly, because the objective conditions has changed (technology improved, network grew) since its introduction by Satoshi. It is the cap that should make the system more secure with respect to protection from attacks, but not the cap that should create obstacle for using the system in the way it was used for 7 years.


Who detects whether it is "detrimentally high" or just "high" or "normal"? It's like being half-pregnant, you either need to be for "fee market" or against it. I put the fee market in quotes, because we already have a true fee market. It is just not an "artificial fee market".
There is no point to discuss my second part of response, but I'm truly interested to hear your objections on arguments I put about LNs.
And now I go an whine a little, because there is rain outside.

Thanks for your time to give such a long answer.


I didn't think about privacy issue before, but what is your vision on privacy in the following scenario:
You need to have at least 2 inputs:
Normal transaction:
    Input1 - 10
    Output 1 (coffee) - 3
    Output 2 (change) - 6.8
Assume 0.2 is not enough as a fee and there is another input address:
So RBF will be:
    Input1 - 10
    Output 1 (coffee) - 3
    Output 2 (change) - 6.8
    Input 2 (new address of payer) - 5
    Output 3 (another change address) - 4.5
So 0.5 is added as an extra fee.
The only privacy violation is that it is seen that Input 1, Input 2 and Output 3 belong to the same person. Input 1 and Input 2 belonging to the same person is not really a privacy issue, because both could be used as inputs for any other transaction. So the only issue that it is know that Output 3 is also from the same person. However, it is not clear which of Output1 or Output2 belong to this payer. As RBF is something that is going to be used not all the time - Output3 basically will dissolve at next payment.
So can you please elaborate or give link about privacy concerns?
With using only one input for both transactions, basically the change Output 2 address becomes known (because it will receive a little less in RBF), but again it will dissolve at next step. RBF is to be used only for stuck transactions, and if you obey the rules of fee calculation - normally you don't need RBF at all, right?


I see your point, that makes sense. But paying currently 4-5 cents is not an issue so that user spends his time to bet and play in order to send fee of 3 cents instead of 5 cents. Also as segwit promises fees going to decrease proportionally to the data transferred decreased then fees will be even less.


I just provided my thoughts above in this comment. And that was kind of obvious scenario when I felt frustration, why RBF is done in the way that everything can be changed there. If there are any flaws in my logic - will appreciate if you correct me. The basic idea is to guarantee that Output1 and Output2 will be in RBF transaction with same amounts locked.


Yes, but as you said probably we are at too early stage for this. But in general miner reward = number of transactions * average fee, so miner reward can grow and replace current block reward with fees only in the way a) increase number of participants=&gt;number of transaction at about same level of fees b) increase average fees with about similar level of users/tnx
I tend to believe scenario a) is more preferable and more probable as we are at very early stage with very low userbase, which can grow dramatically.
I mean speaking about RBFs and how they influence miners - it could be the case that RBFs replace 0-conf transactions, which basically eliminates one part of bitcoin economics, merchants don't accept bitcoin payments "for coffee" or similar stuff, and this reduces that people use bitcoins for this =&gt; less transactions =&gt; less fees for miners.


Can you provide any example when such merchants had losses because they accept 0-conf?
Being a merchant i would do this in the way: 0-conf seen - confirmation of reservation is sent to customer. Booking is not yet paid. When you get (and probably in this case 1-conf is not enough) e.g. 6-conf - send confirmation to customer that payment is accepted with all further details about booking. But booking a flight is totally unrelevant example here, as customer provides all details as by giving fake details - he won't be able to use it. Also KYC allows to chase the customer in case of fraud.
I mean a proper example here is Shapeshift that they accept 0-conf for immediate release of altcoins when you fund with bitcoin. And they were facing issue because of this, as people were able to double spend. But this is their business, they calculate that by allowing immediate conversion - they earn much more than they lose because of double spends. With RBFs you shut down this opportunity to earn for them as they will need to wait 1-conf for marked as RBF transactions. Which makes it less user-friendly as customer needs to wait and basically some customers won't use the service because of this - hence lost opportunity for the company.


Agree, but it is still a use case, and later it could broaden a lot with adoption.








yes, there are probably ways to limit risk, absurd example could be scanning ID of a person when he buys a coffee with bitcoin, I mean this is sure an exaggeration, but generally the accent here on why to make obstacles to merchants, while it was working and was working fine before? People say 0-confs are flawed, but I don't know of a single example when 0-conf issue cost someone a business. Some people lost on this, but they earned much more on this.
I also was doing bitcoin payments in bars and restaurants. You know, there is a lot of confusion for staff to conduct bitcoin payment. Adding RBF complexity at this stage looks like is not justified at all. As I wrote to another redditor here, I agree that moving to a more secure way is generally a good thing, but RBFs doesn't give any security for this segment of business, it simply takes away business opportunity.
To be honest I don't see what is the use case for RBF in general (what other businesses that can win from RBFs). You said people will try to play with sending different fees in order to save money on fees and find more appropriate market fee price, are there any other scenarios how RBFs can be helpful (I read your explanation about miners and consistent state twice - didn't fully get the idea, honestly)?

It's possible only when on average the block propagation time will be more than average block finding means &gt; 10 mins. What is the average block propagation time now? About 30 seconds? That means your scenario may become reality only at block size of 20 Mb now, and taking into account xtreme thinblocks innovation from Unlimited client, it is equivalent of what.. 20*50=1Gb block size?


I checked through recent history, was not able to find two consequent empty ones from them, can you point which blocks are these? But I'm highly confident if you look at times between blocks - it will be very small from previous, like 20 seconds or smth.
I'm not an expert on mining, but I do believe that it is still a distributed setup they have, so it is still some time needed to propagate info even within Antpool infrastructure, during which time another empty block can be found by another part of the network. Again I'm not an expert here, but I don't see any contradiction in their logic. If the empty block is mined after 5 minutes from previous block - yes, than some dirty game is here, as at this time - they will for sure have all info about the previous block with all transactions included there.

What kind of response have you expected? That I will claim that fees at ATMs should not be higher than 0.5%? All of us understand this is not possible. They are just doing business and I see nothing wrong w/ it, having machines w/ 18% is better than having nothing. I genuinely don't get your point. They were probably investigating the market, I remember those machines were charging about 30% at some point of time and finally they chose what they think is best for them. This is called market, whether we like it or not.

But should not it be done then in the way that outputs should not be changed, however, inputs could be changed to whatever is more comfortable for HD wallet or any other wallet.
I mean to do it in the way to guarantee that the recipient that was receiving the payment initially will receive the same amount in the future even when another RBF tnx applied for predecessor transaction?


This is basically the only reason I see RBF could be useful, but in case it is implemented in the way I described above - I think all will be happy, because it is in no-way touches 0-confs, which people use as an argument. If 0-conf is sent to shop it would still accept it whether it is RBF or not, because it is guaranteed by protocol that transaction even if overwritten will result in same outputs with same amount for this particular merchant.
The other 3 arguments I don't fully understand:


Can you please elaborate on this? How RBF allows lower fees and why it's going to be a more efficient market (compared to the case of FSS-RBF)?


Why the current behavior is not consistent? I mean, it was the case when tests were done on network, all tnx settled long in blocks and people knew that tnx should have higher fees in order to settled immediately, it was kind of a market self-regulation. Again don't fully understand your reasoning here.


But as far as I understand this basically not makes it better, rather makes it worse, as it eliminates many use-cases how people use bitcoin even today (I mean 0-conf).


E-commerce purchases are no-way different now, shops wait for confirmations in any way before sending out goods (and there is always lag in time after you paid and your order is shipped, it doesn't happen during 10 minutes).
The problem with RBF is about small purchases at real store and for small purchases where it doesn't make sense to identify the customer, like coffee, as this is the mostly used example in order to prove 0-conf are needed.
In no practical way merchant can use his software in the way to wait for confirmation first before serving the customer.

As you addressed to this comment from our [dicussion]( I reply here.
I read your thoughts on the contradiction of short-term and long-term interests of miner and I don't fully get the logic to be honest.
So you assume that miner short term need to produce blocks as big as the max block size limit. Why?
First of all - there might be not enough transactions in the mempool for this. Second, max limit can be bigger than average blocks produced and this could be an equilibrium.
As you say if miners want to vote for current block size limit of 1Mb the majority of miners just continue mining of 1Mb blocks (no need to reduce it to 50%), limit will be increased to 2Mb in a while based on median of 1Mb, but miners still continue mine 1Mb blocks and market will be stable.
Actually as I mentioned in another comment - there are forces moving block size into different sides.
Orphan rate will push miners to decrease block size. According to [Peter Rizun]( current orphan rate is 1% of all blocks and this can increase with increased block size. Also this increase will probably be not linear to block size.
Jonathan Toomim did [some analysis on testnet]( and it shows that at 8Mb per block Chinese miners will have long propagation times due to Chinese firewall, that means orphan rates can increase a lot motivating them to mine smaller blocks.
If the increase from 1Mb to 8Mb block will increase orphan rate from 1% to say 10%, that means 9%*25 BTC (current reward) is 2.25 BTC loss on every mined block on average. Currently transaction fees bring smaller amount to miners than this, so for them it makes sense to ignore fees and rely on reward solely, means to reduce block size and decrease orphan rates.
10% orphan rate is something I just made up and it could be different, but generally the logic works and market will be self-regulating.
So the technology will evolve, which will allow to propagate blocks faster, then orphan rate will decrease at same block sizes and then miners will be incentivized to increase block size, because now their marginal gain will be more than marginal loss. You know it is kind of basic microeconomics 101 course when they compare marginal cost of production and marginal profits in order to find an optimal production point for manufacturer, but very same logic perfectly applies to block size self-regulation.
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:58:30
I just try to be short however to address your concerns:
Regarding the fees - my vision is not exactly what you summarized. My view is that miners on their own can decide on fees threshold which tnxs to include. So it is not that every miner will include all tnxs from mempool, but the one who wants to do it. It is similar to how it is now, there is minimum recommended fee based on transaction size, but there are miners who still can mine it with 0-fees. Same approach stays the same for the future. Miners on their own decide what to include and every miner has his own economic incentive to maximize his profits.
Addressing your question about the future, when hardware costs are small, badnwidth costs small, there are still rent to be paid, electricity etc. In the end of the day, if there is literally 0-costs to run mining farm (not real case), there is still minimum profit amount miners want to earn, so they can't include only 0-fee transaction in order to run mining equipment, they still need to be profitable. So if all transactions on network become 0-fee, miners will be incentivized to set the minimum, and this is how fees will increase.
So basically general approach - let the market decide what the equilibrium parameters.


I don't get the logic here, why you want to go to 2 cents, but not to 0.5 cent? I think differently here. Also how do you decide that 2 cents is ok, and $2 is too big? I don't care if the fee becomes $15. But only if this increase happens due to market natural conditions, e.g. huge adoption, technology is not enough to cover growth speed, miners can't propagate bigger blocks, they just increase minimum fees they want transactions to have. If it grows to $15 because of this - then ok, there will be less people using the system, transactions number decrease, fees decrease. This is market, it will self-regulate. Technology will improve, and the same transaction volume will be less costly to mine - then fees for customers decrease, new customers jump on board.
Same in the scenario of short-term vs. long-term goals. As you say, short-term they want more profits, include everything, users set lower fees, profits of miners fall, there are less miners as some need to close mining, other set minimum required fees, rest miners adjust fee pricing, fee increase, the higher the fees new miners come, etc.
I don't see any contradiction, just let market decide where the equilibrium is.
Your proposition might be meaningful, just put it as a BIP and suggest to devs. If there is enough support it could be evaluated, there is not really much sense to prove it only to me.

ouch, first time hit 10000 limit on reddit comment, here is the second part:


I agree with you that running a full node is the way to be sure about state of blockchain. However, I strongly think you are misled by figures here. 99.9% SPV clients relying on 0.1% nodes can be fully decentralized and no problem with it. It is basically something like this already, if there is say 1 million users and 6000 nodes. Percentages doesn't mean anything here, what means is the number and independence of nodes behind. If you have **100 million people** using bitcoin (1/3 of the U.S. population) and if there are **100 thousands independent bitcoin nodes (~15 times more than now)**, is this a trustless system in your opinion? Because it falls exactly for 99.9% trust those 0.1% nodes.


This is from an article 1 year ago. 
And he is talking about difficulty to store your bitcoins safely for average Joe at the moment. I fully agree with him, what is the issue here? But again this is totally not relevant to bitcoin impediment which is introduced by Core team now. I hope you clearly see the difference yourself.


Strongly disagree here. Bitcoin is public domain. Also for example bitcoin.org was registered and passed by Satoshi initially. I don't care if Theymos creates his theymos reddit sub and do whatever he wants there. But this sub was for a long time a place for an independent and fair discussions about bitcoin. Lately it can be hardly called like this.
This is similar if there is some individual comes and registers site microsoft.nz in New Zealand, he will lose this domain easily later via court case initiated by Microsoft. The issue with Bitcoin is there is no central company behind that can sue current "owners". Also opinion manipulation is why all this crap in community happened. I see you are a reasonable person, but I see you are definitely falling under propaganda to some extent like with this internet connection speed. And I think it is due to lack and blockage of information including here.


By core you mean core team? Of course there is no evidence, although no proof it is not connected as well. But I never meant that anyone from Core team ordered this attack, also they definitely have financial resources available, as many are early adopters sitting on some meaningful amount of bitcoins. Anyway, I think this will be crazy if they do it, so I do believe it is not related to team members. But what is obvious is that these attacks are sponsored by someone hardly supporting core and against anything alternative, or you don't find it obvious?


They are no free. Take just DDOS attack in mind, miners get DDOSed and hence lose money (this is a business first of all and they switch back to whatever generates stable income, ideology is good, but not when you start losing money), home internet users who run nodes get attacked - lose internet, hence not run node anymore. I mean this "free" is far from reality especially with so much politics in bitcoin lately.


Many probably do. Ether was pumped from $1 to $10 in just one month. Shapeshift volume grew %1000 over 2 month of 2016. Isn't it an indication that bitcoins are sold, alts are purchased? Regarding miners switching, this is not a plug and play thing you can do in 5 secs by clicking the button. If you have mining farm, you need to go over many devices to switch every and each and set it to new pool (I don't know details as never mined, but I've seen comments that it is not that easy to switch a big farm, won't say much as I'm far from expert here). They have a huge intertia with respect to actual actions. Also now it is kind of uncertainty period, when pools are kind in support of classic in public, but still mine core, e.g. Antpool. So if you are a miner connected to antpool, are you going to jump to some random small pool that supports classic? And you know that small hash rate will make payments out rare and random? Miners like stability. So it is obvious it is not changing that fast like many people screamed before. Such a change requires time. But I don't agree with those saying miners stick with Core. Most of them don't like it. Also businesses don't like what Core promotes. Check last round table meeting minutes. Most representatives there were against this backdoor meeting blockstream organized with mining industry.


Sure it did. Not less useful than yours or any other node on the network. Till split happens - all nodes are doing absolutely the same job.
I see we are kind of not taking extreme positions on both sides and I'm glad about it, as I think it is always good to keep mind open. I see you have some valid points and concerns. However, just try to think with your own head and do your own calculations. Whenever somebody from Core or Classic says something - don't take it for granted.

I clearly understand this, but who guarantees that initial fee of transactions will stay the same as today? This is economics and behavioral approach, after introduction of RBF users will probably be more relaxed about sending much-lower-fee transactions as they feel confident they can replace it later if any problems with higher fee one.
So generally, while they will send second RBF transactions with higher fees (compared to their initial ones) - it will be still lower than today's used average fees, because the fee market moved down in general because of RBF.
So I still don't see any flaw in the logic that RBF != higher fees. The market can move in either direction and this will result in higher or lower profits for miners, but you can't say for sure fees will grow on average.
However, they can grow because of limited space in blocks, but this is unrelated to RBF at all. Average market fees will also grow if blocksize is not enough even without RBF as well.
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:54:13
I see your point, but the whole thing about insecureness of 0-conf is questionable, after what I read I see it is no less secure than RBF, however, much more useful.
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:02:04
ok, I see your point although I strongly disagree with.


They are hugely affected, actually use cases are made impossible, although they were possible before.


Why someone should tell businesses what they should do. It is their choice to decide whether it is secure or not, Peter Todd can't decide it for them. If they lose money, it is their money, not Peter's.
But this is not even about Shapeshift and businesses who lose customers, this is about users as well.
I give you a simple use case with Shapeshift as you mentioned this service and will appreciate your comment on this in the light of how it is "minimally affected", although I think it is affected a lot of.
    **Use case:**
    
    Bitcoin user (me) wants to buy digital goods in online shop which accepts dogecoin.
    I don't have to go through the hurdle of installing dogecoin wallets or relying on someone else, I simply check out at online shop and am given let's say 10 minutes and doge address where particular amount of doges needs to be sent.
    
    Now I as a user go to shapeshift, enter dogecoin address of the shop and send bitcoins to shapeshift, and it's done. Shapeshift converts and sends funds almost immediately by relying on 0-conf.
    
    Now, because RBF introduced and 0-confs are eliminated, I need to wait for 1 confirmation on blockchain in order to get dogecoins first, but that means I'm out of time on the online shop and payment won't be accepted.
    
    That means I'm as a user have to install dogecoin wallet, convert it e.g. via Shapeshift, and then using my own keys send payment to dogecoin address of the shop.
    
    I don't want to have this all hassle with dogecoin wallet as a user. I just want to make a one-time dogecoin payment, maybe I will never use dogecoin again, but because you guys decided for me that it is insecure to do such a payment, I'm just out of this opportunity anymore.
The big problem with RBF - it doesn't add anything with respect to security. It is basically equal to say - just wait for 1 confirmation and you are fine. But merchants can do this already, so no better security here at all. If you want to force somebody to do something, then this is kind of planned economy in soviet times when people at top "knew" what the demand in the country was and what people should consume. We know how it ended very well.

Here is a collection of info to start:
[Bitcoin ATM profitability calculator]( - you can use to calculate ROI in case you have estimations.
[Here are examples of how much other locations do]( - on average good location brings $20-30K volume / month. Many people say I'm too optimistic, but these are values I get from many operators. Some do better, some worse.
Here are things to pay attention to when [starting a bitcoin ATM business](
I think there are two main things you need to address before diving with your head into it:
* legal requirements - in the U.S. you need to spend a while and do things properly, not to have problems later.
Here are a few links that will help you to start:
[Bitcoin ATM regulation 101](
[Bitcoin ATM regulation 102](
[Bitcoin ATM for beginners](
* bank relationships
Another important thing to address is creating a full exchange cycle, so you sell bitcoins for cash, and then somehow convert cash to bitcoins. Normally you would have a bank account where you deposit cash and send to exchange where convert to bitcoins, but due to lack of bank relations - it is very hard to find a partner for this. So make sure you paid enough attention to it and have a plan B in case your account is closed.

So you get free publicity in local press, you get new links from online directories, which increases your site rankings and improves business visibility.
The only thing which I would consider is whether to install yourself, or just partner with some existing operators. I know many of them are looking for a good location. Cooperation will remove all headaches with organizing the stuff. If you need contacts - send me a pm where you are located and I will put you through with operators in the area.

This is highly likely connected to BitGo attack if operator was using their wallet.
Lamassu recommended to temporarily turn off machine, read here 
So you can contact operator in this case Bitcoin Direct:
Support phone: 844-VEND-BTC
Support email: info
And check status of it. At least BitGo is back online and probably machine can be turned on by operator already.
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:52:25
Highly probable not, otherwise it would be lower already. Demand is limited, you don't get much more traffic w/ lower fees to justify lower price. This what market has set in current conditions and operators maximize their profits.

On all bitcoin ATMs you define amount of fiat currency you want to withdraw first. Then it gives you a QR code with address where to send bitcoins, also a particular amount of bitcoins to be sent is displayed on the screen or printed on receipt (depending on machine type).
Usually QR code supports amount autodetection by wallets (so needed amount is set inside QR code) - so it should be automatically detected by most of the wallets and displayed to you for confirmation only after you scan it.
Here is a [tutorial with videos how to sell bitcoins at a bitcoin ATM]( Check it for machine type you want to use.

6% is lower than what bitcoin ATMs charge on average (8%). All depends on use case. Now you can come to HCMC w/ bitcoins and cash it out immediately in local currency. 6% is comparable to what you pay eg at airport exchange office (usually 10% or more) when converting from USD to local currency.

Exposure is definitely better, but you need to realize that costs are also higher. With local business you can reach into agreement even to place for free, but just bring traffic to the shop owner, which won't work with shopping mall, where you need to pay for location rent and everything extra.
EDIT: I confused the comment author with OP, and assumed you are looking in CA (but it is not in original post), let me know which state or city you are and I check a list of closest machines to you, which are in shopping malls there.
@_date: 2016-06-18 11:12:20
Sorry for late response. Yes, there are 4 in the center of Calgary. In total there are 9 in and around 
I know malls in the U.S. charge about 1-2K per month for locations, which is quite substantial amount.
Great that you are looking in bitcoin ATM business opportunities.
Let me know if you have any other questions, will try to help with advice. I think it might be pretty hard there with BTM, as there are 9 around already. I mean, yes there is missing one in South part, but bitcoin demand is still limited, and sometimes people ready to travel 1-2 hours one way, so I think it might be not a lot of advantage to put it in South of the city.
@_date: 2016-06-09 08:13:52
Average worldwide buy bitcoin fee at ATMs is 8%, in the U.S. it is higher, I think on average 10-11%, didn't check stats lately. So 9% is in mid market or lower than market in case you purchased in US, whether it is fair or not is a subjective question. For operators running machines, this is definitely fair.

He wants to sell bitcoins to machine, not buy. That is why it is that cheap. Some operators purchase bitcoins from users even at prices better than market.

Nice try to attack me in public.


That is lie, please provide your evidence. Here I allow you to show internal correspondence or screenshots of it in public.


Again, just your assumptions.


Bitexpress and MetroBTM brings me $100 per month in total, you should have known that as you used featured operator service as well which costs $50/month. They are not where I make money, and you know it, but still trying to attack my reputation.


If other operator tomorrow will ask to remove you - and I will follow this immediately, do you think it is the right way? Article in OP is posted on 14 Jan, and this is one of the first public notions of this case, article on coindesk was on 12 Jan.


Start with yours, pls.


That is not your business. You never told me how much you're making on all your customers, why should I tell you.
And now let's get the full picture. I know there is a group of operators, who are pissed off with what I'm doing and you are definitely a part of it. You even created account to give your [negative comment]( on the article I've written, but then disappeared without giving details what is exactly wrong there, I assume because there is nothing you could tell.
Mostly before your dissatisfaction was about information I share on the blog, you guys were pissed off that I create competition for your business that new people start and try to run bitcoin machines. Later on it moved to other services, like Analytics which I launched just recently, as you saw this as a tool can be used by competitors, and you obviously didn't want to use it. I know you guys are trying to sabotage my work by misinforming other operators and biasing against me, and even working on another similar website, which is totally fine. I think the more there are sites like mine the better, as it gives more access to info for end-users where to buy/sell bitcoins.
However, what worries me is that you do this behind my back, I asked explicitly on slack that if there are any issues or concerns with what I do -- please contact me for discussion. None of you have approached me. What I see only are some attacks from drop-off accounts on reddit like yours. Pls grow your balls and contact me in public or in private, I always listen to what worries people, of course, including operators as they bring most of the revenue to me.

There is a general way of [how to buy bitcoins from ATM]( Verifications depend on country, region and operator itself, as even within same legal environment operators may choose to use different forms of verifications.
Generally used in the U.S.:
- small amount without verification
- bigger amount using mobile verification by SMS
- bigger amounts by scanning your ID doc.
However, you can still find a machine that will allow to make a big amount transaction fully anonymous. Search for your best location.

@_date: 2016-11-04 06:28:45
You mean licence is required in some states, and in others not. Agree. Although general practice is that when you sell from own stock you might get excluded from requirement to get license, however, when transferring funds from exchange - highly likely you'll need license, even in states when former is excluded. And right, finding it out is always a costly process.
@_date: 2016-11-03 07:47:17
And plus to pay for money transmission licence, which costs a fortune to get in some states... and also hello Bitfinex, in case of operating via hotwallet, operators still hold money on exchanges, but the risk is diversified..

Good advice. OP just create QR code using any online generator site, e.g.  then print it and bring to ATM, that will save you a lot of time..
Blackfrog uses Genesis Coin machines, so entering address at ATM should also be possible, but that is a cumbersome way..
@_date: 2016-11-03 11:35:39
If you sell bitcoins from your stock, then its vending machine. If you are intermediary between exchange and your customers, well, it's not vending machine even by definition. Not sure about court decisions, but there were some operators shut down by regulators in the past due to not proper licensing based on operations provided.
@_date: 2016-11-11 18:00:26
Probably in order to follow the limits they have: CHF 500 per day and 5000 per year..
@_date: 2016-11-03 16:06:18


It's not about time elapsed, it's about origin of funds.
In case you have bitcoins in your wallet where from you send BTC to customer (BTC you hold before the purchase happened), and at the same time you replenish from exchange to lock the price for yourself - that's fine.
If you get BTC from exchange and then send it to customer - doesn't work, as you literally send the funds you just got, means you are intermediary.
Initially you were talking about sending directly from exchange to customer if I got you right, which is clear evidence of intermediary service you would provide.


Go over this article, PYC operator the first came up in my memory that was shut down 
I see many times words like "penalty" and "fines", and no single "court" there. Of course PYC probably could go to court, but for obvious reasons it is waste of time and money, and we all know who would win this case.

CeX in UK runs machines without fees, e.g. the one in [London](

I see your point, so basically you meant to collect funds but have them further deposited at this company's account in traditional bank?
This is kind of bank on top of bank. In this case you don't need banking license, right.
But it looks a bit complicated. I think what is required - an easy point to exchange fiat-&gt;bitcoin, bitcoin-&gt;fiat. Those deposit services are actually redundant and introduce another third-party with additional counterparty risk.
However, your argument about splitting AML/KYC procedures and the operation itself - totally make sense. The guys from Qwikbit (Lamassu bitcoin machine on Isle of Man) did exactly this.
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:08:44
Next time you will ask for confirmation of the confirmation?

It is actually around 6% on average with some even doing this without fees (rare case).
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:01:20
Depends on the amount you want to buy, there could be some AML/KYC rules.
So generally for buying bitcoin you need wallet on your phone (or some machines even can print for you) and you need cash.
Then depending on the amount and operator rules, some will require phone verification by SMS, or even ID scan.
Check here more details about process of [buying bitcoin at bitcoin ATM](
But no other app is basically needed. You can even come without wallet on your phone, but just with pre-printed QR code of your wallet, which you can scan at ATM.

*Any customer with channels at both exchanges is able to route payments between them and collect fees for the service.*
This is one of the biggest misunderstandings, if customer opens channels with exchanges they can't route payment via this customer, they need to open channels with him/her. Now, why they will do this? Why they will lock funds with particular customer? This issue is broader, as it is easy open channel in the direction from small player to big player, it is harder to get it drilled down to small player back. This is a huge limitation of LNs, as only payments to big players can be done, e.g. pay to Overstock store possible, but paying to a person hardly possible.
Another thing which nobody can address is money transfer licensing. For me it is obvious, that being a node routing the payment might easily be required to have such license, which costs a fortune. Now think who could have it, and you will get similar world we have now with visa and mastecard, when there will be only few big transmitting nodes. This can work, but that is not Bitcoin as we know it.
@_date: 2016-02-27 18:18:40
Many things depend on the machine type, operator and amount of cash you want to get.
Here is general process description [how to sell bitcoins at ATM](
Some operators didn't require a single confirmation for not big amounts (~$200, but I know about cases up to $1000). Probably after core 0.12 client and RBF introduction there now all require at least 1 conf.
From verification point of view two-way machines usually ask at least for mobile verification by SMS (be ready for this) and in case amount is big enough - ID scan might be required at machine. But again this varies from machine to machine, you need to check for the ones you plan to visit.
You can find machines which allow sell bitcoin operation at [coinatmradar.com]( (use filter at the bottom to show only crypto-&gt;cash supporting).
In case this is a BitAccess machine you want to visit, recently they added a functionality to send bitcoins before you visit bitcoin ATM. Here is description on their [blog](
So you can send bitcoins beforehand and when come to machine - just use the given redeem code and get cash instantly without waiting for confirmations as bitcoins you sent will probably be confirmed already in the blockchain by this time.
Feel free to ask if you need any further help.

It was initially posted 18 months ago, but I regularly update it with new information I find. There are several pretty recent examples. You need to read it, but not only look at publishing date.
From what I know from discussions with many operators across the world, the average volume for an average machine is about $30K per month if it's in a good location. Normal volume reaches in about 6-8 months from start. That is a good point to start calculation. Here is a [profit calculator]( for this purpose. Average fee worldwide for buys is about 7%, in U.S. it is higher, I assume about 10%, didn't check lately.
However, there are also many costs. I don't say running a bitcoin ATM is easy money and everyone should jump onto the train. I think such times passed when every bitcoin enthusiast bought skyhook for $1K and installed somewhere at his small shop. Right now the market matures, bigger players come into play, there are more requirements to run it as a business, there is more clearness now legal-wise than 2 years ago when it just started, and it generates more hassle and costs as operators need to be KYC/AML compliant, means you need to spend on lawyer, licensing, getting your compliance policy written.
But it is possible to run machines profitable and many do, although again, this is not an "earn easy money" market.


This is very subjective, I mean that's your opinion, but it is not based on any real metrics.


Agree, but this is only for bitcoin to cash, and the main demand which bitcoin ATM machines cover is buying bitcoins with cash not vice versa. It is 90%/10% ratio with dominance of bitcoin buy transactions (info from many separate operators).


That might happen, but much further in the future than even your projected 3-5 years. Majority of bank ATMs today are run based on Windows XP, do you seriously think they can be adjusted for bitcoins? I think if there will be native shift of bank ATMs to bitcoin direction (first of all the banks themselves have to make this shift to bitcoin in general) - they will need to update hardware or at least software on the whole network, and I'm not sure this is possible on existing hardware, otherwise I don't understand why financial services are provided on OS, which doesn't receive even security updates anymore. And these are tremendous costs for such updates. I mean, all is doable but I hardly believe it will happen at least in any foreseeable future. If the market will grow that big current operators will eat a great profit share till this moment.
By the way many bank ATMs can be used already even without cards you mentioned, e.g. in Spain, Poland ChipChap provides possibility to sell bitcoins, but again this only about sales, not purchases.


Don't agree with this. Figures show different trend, just look at localbitcoins charts (which basically reflect the demand for cash to bitcoin and vice versa operations) - it grows and grows a lot. This is the same market bitcoin ATM cover. My opinoin, is that Bitcoin ATM is even more convenient and reliable than meeting some stranger for money exchange. So I don't see any problem with sustainability of the market. Bitcoin adoption is so tiny at the moment, and bitcoin ATM is one of the easiest option to get your bits, compared to going through registration process at exchanges, sending all your docs and waiting for several days to be approved.
Bitcoin ATM market is growing, although may be not the fast, but I see acceleration recently.

Assuming 7Mb will come from spam (1Mb is taken by normal operations as of now), that will cost spammers at least 0.00001 BTC/Kb * 1024 * 7 ~ $30 per block or  $4320 per day.
So who do you think will pay this amount and mainly for what purpose?
Also if the spam is consistent miners will probably change block inclusion minimum fee and that will raise costs for spammers much more.

This is not obvious for any discussion, this is simply wrong. We would't have 8Mb size blocks today even if Gavin's suggested cap has been imposed.
If we have it in 8 years from now - is it a big problem, when 1TB will cost probably $10 or less? I don't think so.


Why do you think so? If it changes overnight - yes, it's a problem, but if network grows continuously with the natural demand size and technology advancement - not a big issue.
Answering your initial post question:


Also, in the future there for sure will be a solution to save on storing and transferring the whole history of data.
Just an example coming to my mind, there could be a parallel data structure (which replaces part of existing main blockchain) with cleaned transactions history, with only UTXOs. Like block restructuring leaving only UTXOs and then you hash those new blocks and include this hash into current block. All nodes verify that all unspent transactions are there and after this basically the previous history can be dropped as it is not needed anymore (e.g. after a significant number of confirmations above the block with included hash has been added).
I'm not an expert - but I think there are so many opportunities people will come up with when it is **really** a problem.

1. They are conservative and as was mentioned many times were waiting for someone taking decision and just wanted to follow.
2. Were misled by Core team members, e.g. Maxwell mentioned potential of only 12% improvement, but in practice speed improvement is 5000%, which eliminates the bandwidth bottleneck problem fully, as blocks can be 50Mb, which will be comparable to current 1Mb propagation speed, and hence bottleneck will shift to disk storage instead of bandwidth. Also last meeting with Back where he tried to persuade them, and the following game with signing the roadmap as president or individual. Also the roadmap on top of another roadmap from Core is misleading by itself. But some miners/pools already started opening eyes and see what's going on.

I see your point about legislation, but hardly see it will adopt. Maybe in 20-30 years, but initially it will be a huge resistance, with particular lobby trying to ban everything related to LNs.
Regarding paying for anonymity, I see it is about 20-30% now, at least this is how much people pay on purse.io, which basically allows to get bitcoins anonymous I think.
Regarding uni vs. bi-directional channels, my understanding was that for bi-directional channel both parties need to open it by funding multisig address, at least this is what I understood from white paper.
If it works like you describe - this is a big advantage. But I dont get how it can work technically. Can you elaborate? My understanding is that payment within channel is basically sending signature for particular amount.
If customer opens 1 BTC channel with exchange C and then sends this 1 BTC via this channel. What you say exchange C now can send payment to exchange B via customer say for 0.5BTC using this 1 BTC received, but what stops exchange C then to close channel and use the full 1 BTC payment and basically frauding customer?

Ok, now it looks like you are spreading FUD.
First of all BitLicense is a local doc issued by NYSDFS, and has nothing to do with FinCEN.
But also..
The regulations define virtual currency business activity as any one of the following types of activities:
But, the 2 following activities **are excluded** from the definition of virtual currency business activity:
**development and dissemination of software in and of itself**,
How then bitcoin software development is connected to BitLicense as it is out of scope of this doc?
@_date: 2016-02-12 10:07:06


I'm eager to see where FinCEN clearly states that hard fork of a virtual currency is a new virtual currency :)
Also here is the FinCEN guide on Virtual currencies
They talk about users, administrator, exchange. Creator and administrator there refers to the ones who create units, but not creating software code.
Although for centralized virtual currencies administrator has to register, in case of de-centralized virtual currency - miners are assumed as users and not required to register with FinCEN.
IANAL, but reading FinCEN regulation it is obvious this guy is spreading FUD.
Why he is not talking about MSB registration of Lightning Networks and need of implementing them in AML compliant way? Oh wait..

You issue a currency when you mine it, not when you develop software.


This phrase also literally says in plain English that if you only develop software - you should not care. Also having this phrase make it clear that issuing currency is definitely something else, but not software development.

Exchange - agree. "publicly releasing a coin" - where did you read about it? It is not mentioned in the doc. And what do you exactly mean under "releasing"? So development of Classic and putting it on github is a releasing of new coin in your understanding? It is written explicitly that it is excluded.
As you read software development (incl. development of Classic) has nothing to do with this regulation, so initial article was FUD with respect to this point. That was the point.

Thanks for your reply, looks like many things changed since I read whitepaper on LNs, need to reread it.


However, this just raised the logical concern. If it's done like this (payment within lighting is done in the way that recipient can't control funds [to new multisig address as you wrote]), how is it going to function at all? I mean, how it is different from simply saying over email I send you this amount. The set up is that the funds are still in 2-of-2 multisig as they were initially when channel was opened.
Before when I read it the point was that recipient can broadcast transaction at any moment and get current state of channel settled. Now it looks like to be not the case according to what you write. So how is it going to function if for example customer A won't provide the key and time passes - then initial transaction will be unlocked, but it won't represent actual balance state within channel anymore, so recipient will still lose.

First of all you ignored the question - about who would like to waste money on this. I agree there could be periodic attack to check burdens, but burning money consistently is out of logic of any reasonable spammer.
Regarding miner's benefit - they benefit even more if they raise the minimum fees and same spam occurs.

I never meant that fees from transactions have to replace full reward miners get today or in the nearest future. Block mining reward will start fully coming from transactions only in 2140 or about this year, so we have roughly 125 years for investments steady increase in infrustructure, don't see any problem here.
Block reward halves every ~ 4 years, so after the halving this year, there will be 4 years till next halving, which is half of the whole bitcoin life currently, but even then the halving will still leave substantial part of reward coming not from transaction fees. And so much can be done till then with respect to optimization and technology also will make it step forward over 4 years.
Keeping the fees low can bring new customers =&gt; hence price of bitcoin grows + more transactions in bitcoin economy, so in the end miners can even earn much more compared to the case when fees rise and nobody uses the system.


Nobody argues against this statement even including all Classic supporters.
@_date: 2016-02-13 21:26:03
Hey, thanks for coming back, because I think I get some knowledge about LNs discussing with you.
I've heard some podcasts meanwhile and I see what you mean.
So basically every transaction issued within channel is timelocked, and the time locking each transaction is going backwards, means later issued transactions within channel have earlier unlock time.
That means if Exchange B tries to spend money from transaction 1, when they already did transaction 2, basically customer A will see they broadcasted it, and broadcast transaction 2, which will happen earlier.
I see some risks coming, when transaction 2 will not be included in the blocks, which means that transaction 1 unlock time will be reached, when transaction 2 is still not confirmed


Should be vice versa here right, first transaction is not valid until timelock for second transaction is reached + some additional block height, right?
Also with latest tendency from Core to influence fees, channel parties will have no clue what the fee will be at the moment when timelock is finished, so they can't define fee in the transaction, so that it will be included in the blocks for sure quickly. In case it is not included - this is a failure of the model, as there will be a way to cheat other party.
Also there needs to be monitoring implemented on both channel sides, that means e.g. wallet software or something that will be responsible for channel will need to run all the time, otherwise one side can miss the moment, when other side is cheating. And this complicates the things, as you can'y use wallets in same way you use now, like Multibit SPV client. You open it, sync, send transaction, close.
Is my understanding correct now? What is your opinion on the last two points?


I didn't get this. They send signed transactions, but not private key. Sending a private key gives another party (Customer A) full power to send all funds to himself at any moment, which doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2016-02-09 14:26:23


Gavin is not the one who fills blocks.
8 Mb cap is totally different from actual block size, don't misinterpret these two things.
New 1 Tb drive costs about $50, so not really a problem to be honest for several years.
Also there is no sense to back up blockchain as you said you've been told, it is backed up across the world. With unlimited internet today and high speeds, re-downloading blockchain file should not be a big deal, just a matter of several hours.

Can you give examples of countries and how much it costs there. So your vision that companies in U.S. for example won't be part of LN? Did I understand you correctly?


That's a myth, with LNs you can always prove who is the first node via which you are routing payment, because you explicitly open channel with this party. This is easily can be used for legal enforcement.


You are putting my words out of context. What I said that if customer A opens channel 1 with exchange B and channel 2 with exchange C, it is not possible for exchange B to route payment via customer A to exchange C or vice versa. However, it was explicitly stated in the article.
What is possible in this set up that customer A will be able to pay to/via exchange B, or to/via exchange C. But this is much less useful use case.
What am I misunderstanding exactly here?

OK, good. I do believe that exchanges won't care to open channels with their customers manually, but let's assume they do this in automatic way that anybody can open a channel with them by initiating it. So 2-of-2 multisig is created.


I didn't ask about this, this is totally clear and different from scenario which I mentioned.
Here is the scenario I described:
Assume customer A opened two channels with Exchange B and Exchange C. And funded both with 1 BTC himself. Exchanges didn't fund any of these channels.
Now he makes a LN payment to Exchange B for 1 BTC, generally by sending signature. Now as you say Exchange B can pay to Exchange C via customer A.
Assume this is done.
What happens next Exchange C closes channel and gets 1 BTC.
Now Exchange B closes channel with the previous transaction customer A sent to them and gets also 1 BTC (which already didn't belong to them as they transferred it to Exchange C).
There is something in the whitepaper describing the penalty in case not the latest signature is broadcasted described in chapter 3.1.4 (probably this is what you mean they will lose everything in the channel) - but this has no sense in the setup I describe as exchanges don't fund channels, so there is no penalty can be applied, also it is not clear how to implement such penalty autotrigger, as bitcoin protocol doesn't care about LNs, and basically broadcasting valid transaction will make the payment.
Can you help to understand how the customer A is insured in this case that he won't lose 1 BTC in such a fraud scheme? Or just direct me to proper chapter in LN white paper.

The core advantage of LNs afaiu is not that you can establish channels with parties you want to pay directly, but that all channels form a payment network, which basically can allow anyone to pay to anyone. Of cousrse, they may become just receiving LN nodes, if software will allow this. But that is not that useful.


You do understand that U.S. law works out of U.S. as well? That is why Swiss banks have to provide info now about US citizens to US authorities, that is why companies which are not registered in US, but still had to ban New York users in order not to full under BitLicense.
I mean, I agree with you that there will be potential some shift into non-regulated countries. But the fact that majority of bitcoin users and companies are in US, this will be a very restricting factor. People talk a lot about tech side of LNs, which I agree is great, but totally ignore real life problems like regulation. And this is something not to be underestimated.


Agree, this is probably possible. But the main idea of LNs is that people open channels for some real life problems, e.g. you need to pay for coffee often in Starbucks, and then those channels used for routing payments to recipients in several channel jumps. You are right, that probably opening channel specifically for the purpose of routing payments via this node is possible. Although the motivation for opening those anonymous nodes is very low, as the only incentive is to get fees, which will be very low, compared to violation of law and potential imprisonment. Anyway, this is something can be seen only when LN works and how it evolves.


I never said anything against it. Applying this to examples with a person in between two exchanges - in order for the routing to work at least one exchange needs to open channel with customer, and this as I said will hardly happen, why exchange will lock funds with any of its users? This is the problem I see, which I mentioned that channels can and will easily be opened to the bigger players direction, they will hardly be opened in reverse direction. That is why routing of payment from exchange to exchange via mutual customer will hardly be possible.

Cash section misses Bitcoin ATMs, one of the easiest ways to buy and sell bitcoins, there are ~800 locations worldwide. Check coinatmradar.com
@_date: 2016-09-15 22:56:57
This tutorial might be useful for you 
In a nuthshell, there are normally three ways:
- 0-conf accepted, means you get cash immediately. But it is usually for not large amounts. However, I know operators who still does it e.g. for amounts up-to $1000.
- several confirmations (usually 1-3, normally 1). You get redeem code and btc address, when you send BTC and get needed amount of confirmations - you just come to machine and put in redeem code and get cash.
- bitaccess machines allow to initiate sell process from home via online (you need to be a registered customer of them already), so you just come to machine later one time only to input redeem code and get cash immediately.
So it depends on machine you plan to use and operator of this machine.

If you have any issues at using ATM - you probably need to contact support. If you did - tell your story in more details here - as it looks half a month for sending money on failed transaction is something abnormal for operators. Usually operators do this asap as complaint comes and the true failure is verified by operator, e.g. cash is deposited, but no outgoing bitcoin transactions. So 1-2 days max.

Regarding the pics - I don't remove the old pictures as it is a history of the location, even if there was a different operator. In the description it is clearly stated that it is Genesis machine now, before it was Lamassu. I don't see any contradiction here to the truth and am not going to change it as I explained in emails.
Regarding the customer complained about machine being one-way and not two-way, this is my fault as I have not updated the direction field correctly, but you never pointed me to this error. It had nothing to do with images you mention. However, after the customer complaint I fixed this issue in description immediately.
You have about 10 machines, and relocate them periodically and change description quite often. Sometimes I feel myself being your employee and updating bunch of only your information, the only difference I do it for free. And instead of being grateful for this, you blame my service not for the first time for updating with big delays, that I have outdated information etc. This is really strange, keeping in mind that wrong information about fees that OP raised was coming from your side as you mentioned above (whichever employee it was) - was it done on purpose or by mistake is a different question.

Why do you think so? The number of bitcoin ATMs is growing. And many people get to know bitcoin via first interaction with the help of bitcoin ATMs.


Rather strong a statement. There is not much scam in bitcoin ATM related business.

For one-way solution I think GB is really good and it is about 2 times cheaper than rest with similar functionality.
For two-way, I think GB and BitAccess are quite comparable in price/functionalities, so placing first is not intended.

You have fees of 76 sat/B, this is far more than needed to get into the next block. So fees for this particular transaction are enough.
However, this transaction uses several unconfirmed UTXOs which used also another unconfirmed UTXOs.
One of the transactions used as a source for yours is this one

How to sweep bitcoins from ATM receipt tutorial

Planned. But there is a problem, as similar service is provided by several independent providers through the same points, e.g.  as well. Of course, I don't want to add them twice, that's why thinking how to better do this.

Those are not bitcoin ATMs per se, but terminals or offices allowing buying bitcoins, or more precisely codes which can be exchanged for bitcoins (similar to ones in Austria). Read more:

Here is a list of [bitcoin ATMs which allow sell bitcoins for cash around Brooklyn](
[This one]( is probably the closest and it charges only 2% for selling bitcoins for cash.
@_date: 2016-05-19 07:27:21
Due to irreversible nature of bitcoin, this is not a good idea as there can be charge backs on the card. And processing company will charge this money out of your pocket in the end. However, you might cover this by your risk policy, e.g. putting smaller limits for operation (which is not good as you are limiting your business growth), and increasing fees in order to cover such losses (also not good as it will be worse than competitors).
Anyway, cash is much better as many still use machines to get "anonymous" bitcoins, which you can't get by using card.
There was one manufacturer in Australia providing similar solution you ask about, but I think they closed their business 
Also I think they had their own "debit card", which you needed to pre-purchase or smth.
Another example is Mutocoin in Israel 
They also used cards instead of cash for purchasing.
I think I remember there was one more hobbyist developing a machine and showing a prototype, also used with cards, but which has NFC function. So you basically needed to touch the pad, rather than insert card in slot. However, I can't find this video now. But it was kind of garage project state.
By the way you can find many bitcoin ATM types here  if you have not yet visited this page.

It should be fine, as you see there are even couple of positive feedbacks left on the site for this machine.
As others told - just try with small amount and see how it settles, then do your desired trade amount.
Also if you want to really preserve your location - replace image in your post. Google search for images works quite well these days.
Fees announced by operator are 0.9% from BTC-e, so it is very good deal knowing how much ATMs charge usually.
Will be great if you could send your feedback to me, so I update the listing with more details.

Germany is very limited in number of bitcoin ATMs. However, close countries are not. So if it is just 1 hour car drive - you might want to go to Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic or Benelux, depending on which part you live in.
Find ATM locations here 
PS and don't forget to click "Other services" at the bottom filter to see many more locations to buy for cash.

The guy provided his phone, ID probably (as he was selling BTC), machine has a camera which probably made a pic of a user and you advise to go there and try to scam an ATM business owner, really? Why not to go to any bank with a gun and ask for cash isntead?

Yes, I think it is general countrywide.
You can find and check all their locations here

It really depends on the operator how many confirmations to set. Sometimes the number of confirmations may depend on the amount you withdraw, which makes sense to me. E.g. I would allow to withdraw up to $200 without confirmations (just transaction to be seen on network), however if somebody wants to get $2000 out of ATM, I would probably ask for at least 2 confirmations.
Just as an example, here is similar Genesis1 machine to what you used, and it withdraws immediately 
Anyway, in your case 50+ confirmations and no withdrawal is definitely some issue, normally it is 0,1,2 - confirmations operators ask.

I see your frustration, as I have not checked the site. You are totally right, that the number I received from the company representative is not listed there.
So have you been able to reach them and solve your issue? What is the state?

hm, 18-24: 10.07% Seems reasonable. Where do you get this under 1%?
@_date: 2015-10-06 07:11:33
Got an email from Eric almost immediately..
In a nutshell his reponse:
"I asked them to contact us on twitter.. Or support # works fine so I dont know why they would say that it says that.(415) 466-2945 is our support   We have not received any emails.."
Also he mentions that there were some temporary issues with connectivity due to service provider, but the machine should work fine now. They have checked the history of tnxs and none of the transactions looked like OP described.
So I would recommend to try contact the operator again, as I was able to do this easily and get response quickly.
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:21:18
Which machine was it? Just contact operator if tnx doesn't hit the address. They will definitely help.
Maybe operator was using blockchain wallet as well for sending out bitcoins, and because of blockchain.info issues they didn't send bitcoins.
**Update:** Looks like your address is not valid. Check here 
Either you mistyped it here, or if you provided the same address to bitcoin ATM it probably could not send bitcoins, as the wallet software should not accept it. However, the ATM UI showed it as if it's ok.
I suggest you contact the operator regarding this.
Interesting what the machine was it as normally it should not accept wrong address when you scan QR code.

I think you are missing one important thing:
In order to run it that way - you need to have a merchant account with a card payment processor - and I think it is highly likely you won't get one as you are not a standard merchant - you are basically providing money services or more precisely exchange services, which I think are excluded from activities you can get approval.
So actually before looking for ATM - I would check legal aspects and also checked potential partnerships with banks/payment processors as this is something you need to operate the way you plan it.
In case of using ATM with cash, you can basically run it without bank account or payment processor, the only thing you will need to find where to exchange cash to bitcoin back. But this is another question. At least it is possible. With cards it might be not possible at all because traditional financial institutions might simply reject your applications due to high risk profile or whatever other reason they use nowadays.

It doesn't work like this. Even if there are 6% of pro Classic miners/pools, due to variance it will be changing over time, so 95% will highly probably be quickly reached by these BIP supporters.
If you look at stats of mined blocks, Classic "lives" in interval 4-6%, so it is more like 5%, not 6% of hashing power backs up Classic implementation now.

We have some online checks implemented, not the status, but online pricing and fees mostly, sometimes limits and verifications type. It depends on the info operator of each machines provides. You need to click "check online". Unfortunately, for both machines in SG - there is no data provided by operators of the machines, so we have nothing to show.
But we have another functionality - user's voting, so literally you as a user may leave feedback about successful or failed attempt to use bitcoin ATM, it will be saved in history and other people could read and get an understanding whether machine is working or not, we also calculate online status of machine based on this. So if it was many times mentioned as offline or removed - it will be reflected in the status.
Regarding your previous search of SG machines, - yes there were many before, I think about 12 machines in SG or something, but almost all of them were removed, so the map was updated. Now as you can see only two left, which we know are still in place. Have they bitcoins or not, this is a different story. Also if you know about other locations - please submit.


For lamassu machines (an both in SG are lamassu) - usually operator sets up in the way, that bitcoins are purchased online on exchange, whenever somebody wants to buy from ATM. But operators can also set up to sell from their wallet (which was probably the case with machine your wife visited), and in this case they need to replenish bitcoins manually, but this not general practice to my knowledge.
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:38:02


It was a year ago - many things changed, e.g. BitLicense.
I think at the moment volume of $20-30K is something operators should expect after a while, say after half a year when machine becomes known in the area. All calculations can be done based on this.
@_date: 2015-10-12 11:41:32


Useless at the moment, as there is only significant demand from bitcoin buyers/sellers. I know several cases when the machine supported initially several altcoins, but then it was restricted only to bitcoin operations as nobody was using it to buy/sell alts.
Shapeshift is good because it is online and accessible from anywhere, physical location of ATM limits its use.

It is a lamassu machine (very easy to use)

The only possible approach for you I think is to look for a big operator in your region (who already have done all the legal stuff, so adding machines to the network doesn't increase legal costs for them). And then discuss about pricing, so basically your input is investment into the machine itself, liquidity and running the whole thing, which also requires quite a lot of resources, while they provide legal coverage and making your ATM compliant with local law. Then you agree on revenue sharing.
Let me know (can in private also) where you are geographically, I will try to help with contacts in the area.
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:44:10


How is this relevant? Do you know traditional ATMs run by individuals?
EDIT: gave another thought, it is relevant.
Yes there can be fraud using traditional ATMs, e.g. stolen cards, but this is all included into the price. Which basically I suggested as well for OP. There exist card bitcoin ATMs - so the idea makes sense to some extent. However, traditional ATMs are run by banks and bitcoin ATM by individuals or small companies, so I think if someone steals 10K from ATM - it will be a drop in bank's balance sheet, however most probably it will be an end of the business for individual operator. I just put things for concern.
@_date: 2015-10-07 11:45:27
Great, glad for you!

Sorry, don't take my words as offense, you just said you were trying to find ATMs in Singapore, and if you google it with 100% you get coinatmradar on one of the top lines. So I assumed you did know about it.
Anyway, you said there are 2 machines which don't work - why do you think so, have you visited the locations?
Also the one which you say is operational afaiu is not on the map, could you please provide details about it and I add to the map so others will find it easily. thx

Your speed is far more than needed to run a node smoothly, assuming it is Mbit/s. Well it basically means that you can download 1 block per second, and relay 1 block per 3-4 seconds.
It is probably some attack like DDoS that was reported at some time and for some clients.
You might want to change parameter:
-maxconnections=&lt;n&gt; Maintain at most &lt;n&gt; connections to peers (default: 125) To reduce the number of connected nodes.

I think there are different economic cycles in place with 4 years about the min. Kondratiev found long term cycles of several decades for example.
The main wiki article gives several types of cycles: 
Starting with 4 years, and then 7-11 years etc.
I studied a while back, so 4 years was something in my memory, I googled and found the article mentioning 4 years.
According to investopedia it is a bit more than 5 years

Thanks for this interesting post and sharing your experience.
You have a broken link to coinatmradar btw.
Also if you find any inconsistency on the site with respect to description of ATMs - let me know, will update it.
As far as I understand the only issue you've found that machine at Jack's Liquor is set to be one-way? Will check with operator.
Actually General Bytes have different hardware. This one in particular is called BATMThree and is two-way by default, but probably in this case operator has switched off selling bitcoins feature. Will figure out and update accordingly.

Disclaimer: I don't know how in particular the software and checks internally work and do checks, however from what you describe - there is nothing wrong with this scenario.
When you verified as a customer via ID check - you are not limited to use just one bitcoin address for all your operations. In this sense - there is nothing wrong to use address of your gf to sell bitcoins via you as a customer.
In this case your ID will be associated with these bitcoins you sell on the operator side, but there is nothing that can prevent the transaction to be successfully done.
On the contrary, I would prevent you using a different person ID, unless this person comes with you and uses machine on her own. Some machines might ask to make a picture of you for additional checks, it will look fraudlent if person from ID is not the same as the one who uses the machine, so I would highly recommend to use your own ID instead.
