I thought the same thing. When are they going to announce something while everyones freaking out.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:49:19
Whats going to happen when they come back on? Massive sell off?
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:16:42
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:55:06
I didnt sell. I wish I had though!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:27:32
exactly. Cant sell or buy right now. Not sure if they will get executed later though.

"We have new hardware coming within a few hours and we are in contact with companies that make this hardware to boost the system. Actually they contacted us." -mt gox
Is anyone else going to take their bitcoins out before the people who "contacted them" are going to "boost" the system?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:01:32
Its def being coordinated and its happening ad precise times.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:50:51
15k down
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:24:05
I would of made a killing today if I was able to trade w/o delays 
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:57:47
If BTC is going to last. Something has to be done about this.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:35:39
When they have been down before. They put up a notice, or suspended trades. The site hasnt been shut down before though
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:16:29
its not working. people are still making the trades.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:56:10
I want to hear this answer too. 
I mean, when GOX comes back on. I think the prices will plummet. Do you not think that?
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:06:33
Sooooo. Do you guys still have faith it will jump back up? Or do you now think there is no hope and to dump what you have?
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:01:10
I read the post's about UK bank accounts being seized. But wouldnt that only be good for BTC. People real money getting seized, so it forces them to consider BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:47:19
A big reason why the trading keeps plummeting is because people cannot BUY on gox. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:25:11
I tried to sell too. nothing happened. I dont think it will execute at all. There is no transaction, nothing. BTC are still in my account. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:28:41
So can you buy on BTCe and Sell on bitfloor?
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:09:14
Anyone think it is because UK cutting people off from buying BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:12:05
How does that work. How does ~1 bitcoin total drive the price down?
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:59:25
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:57:36
Too bad the lag is too goddamn high to make any sort of knowledgeable trade. wtf
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:56:48
What? Whats that mean? The UK took everyones BTC's??
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:02:37
This idea could help this.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:03:55
I wonder with them going down for 2 hours is going to affect the market?
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:03:47
So no one knows. Alright. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:54:56
makes sense.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:52:56
you see thousands of transactions going through that are .001
Thats the attack
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:27:36
What is better?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:19:37
There may not be much left to fall.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:14:33
I think they already did this.
You cant make any sales for less than 1 anymore
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:08:25
I am looking to buy some, and should I be worried about giving someone my name as well?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:30:51
Can you really make money this way? Someone could make a killing.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:19:02
-11k for the day. Hoping its going to start moving upwards at a substantial rate. I dont need reddit gold though, just wanted to share. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:56:34
Sounds like a big timer from SR wants to cash out. 
Seriously though, I wouldnt be surprised if most of the top BTC holders are originally from SR. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:40:04
I am selling becuase i want to have SOME fucking money and not zero.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:22:37
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:08:14
So this should cause MAJOR concern for the market. Correct?
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:08:00
But. Will they get in trouble for owning BTC? I dont understand. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:22:17
Right now I wish i got my order in 1 hour ago. 
I cant even sell right now.
