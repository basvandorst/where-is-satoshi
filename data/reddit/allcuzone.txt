Exactly, this is just unsubstantial FUD. Users will stop using hubs that implement KYC and they will lose business from liquidity. 
I just don't understand how you can just "implement" KYC.

I believe only a few select coins will be the ones that stay in the future. So yes, most of them are scams or will have little impact.

Did you seriously wipe out your own text and said'fixed that for you' for a Reddit meme lol
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:43:30
Lightning network by itself won't solve everything. A block size increase, schnorr, and other technologies will be implemented to fix

@_date: 2017-12-30 08:56:15
What website or service is this
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:40:29
I agree that hardforks should be avoided, but how else can we keep on like this? I support Bitcoin Core all the way by the way, I'm not trolling
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:49:21
Ok but don't we have to increase it anyway at a point?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:06:23

@_date: 2017-12-04 22:41:22
The host is actually such a lad
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:58:20
I am not trying to troll, but the transactions are getting crazy. I think in the short term we need to at least double the blocksize. I support the Core team hardforking into a doubled blocksize.
If you support the doubling of the blocksize governed by the core team please express your support.

I don't see the market cap of XRP going to 200bln any time soon
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:28:00
The Blockchain info wallet probably tracks that

@_date: 2018-08-21 10:29:47

ffs bcash propaganda fooled me once again
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:16:52
We should be worried. If exchanges collude to all shut down, all the Bitcoin would be centralized into a few entities. Then we will truly have centralization of funds, essentially destroying Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:35:04
This has been there for a long time...
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:47:18
Of course they will still be valid...
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:53:47
Some wallet services don't give you a private key. Best you make one in Electrum if you want the seed
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:10:10
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:46:04
Sell it if you need it. There is no other choice
@_date: 2018-05-31 03:26:49
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:04:27
you confirmed your first statement 
@_date: 2018-08-28 09:08:12
If Bitcoin ever hits 1 million, it won't be all green, it will be because the USD has devalued significantly. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:11:09
I don't understand why people use online wallets. Damnit Electrum is free and its more secure. Don't give me bullshit about the password, there is a SEED people.
Sometimes I wonder if people are just lazy or legitimately clueless
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:12:58
Most people can't explain to me what the internet is...
Doesn't make it bad it's just because people are ignorant
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:27:48
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:45:18
What exchange
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:00:43
If you have the 12 word phrase the private key can be derived from those depending on the derivation path.
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:46:52
See a doctor

but yeah I see what you mean and I'm a big optimist, but BTC needed this shake out.

@_date: 2017-11-05 09:07:13

congratulations my man
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:57:44
I will admit, it kept me awake at night for a good amount of time when BTC hit 5000, but now I have found inner peace. At least I have a piece in the revolution.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:57:45
You don't have access to your bitcoins anymore on the chain.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:55:54
Might be bip 39
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:47:36
Your reasoning is quite sound actually
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:43:46
You can't delete bitcoins, you can delete the private keys holding the bitcoins though.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:19:42
thanks for the imagery
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:09:44
Folders are all empty... So both possibilities won't happen?
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:35:54
Use a lightweight wallet like Electrum :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:34:32
Tell her. Better to be honest than not sleeping at night
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:59:37
This is spooky
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:46:35

@_date: 2017-11-30 23:04:56
Thanks for your research!
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:57:59
So the fork didn't go through
@_date: 2019-02-11 08:32:47
No it doesn't, wtf is now
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:48:42
slower confirmation times, but it won't happen
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:48:50
I laughed

I meant buying plane tickets with bitcoin on expedia 
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:46:30
Yeah I'm sorry. I read that as I own valuable blockchain dot com...
Forgive me
@_date: 2018-03-21 09:14:13
This will force the network to be decentralized 
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:24:51
Great or not great, this is mainstream adoption 
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:22:01
It has begun!

Of course you can. Remember to always check the address.
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:20:53
I don't think you own block chain dot com...
Anyway if you're dealing with large sums just get a translator. Cost should be little to nothing compared to the deal...

I hate to break it to you but nobody is giving away cash to individuals.
