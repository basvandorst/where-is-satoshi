If your savings are losing their value, it's like nothing else matters, isn't it? No pain is as great. Hopefully, his fears won't be realized. An amusing little comic which pokes fun at the deepest fears of hodlers.

Even I'm trying to figure it out. Maybe it's just a case of clickbait headlines. My heart is sinking as I write.

No, that's not at all what I mean. Sometimes, when you're in the thick of a situation, you don't actually see the bigger picture until afterwards. There may be factors involved which aren't initially obvious. I'm not at all referring to bot manipulation. Sometimes, in hindsight, taking all factors into consideration, it's easier to see what was really going on. That's what I mean.

Bitcoin has recently gone into football. I read somewhere that a Bitcoin investment platform signed some sponsorship deals with several European Premier League  clubs and paid for the deals in BItcoin.

Perhaps it's one of those things which, you know, gets clearer with hindsight?

Milton Friedman was a most influential economist. I studied him in  college. Apparently he was a great monetarist and influenced world leaders. Interesting to note that he predicted Bitcoin.

Aww! I thought I was sharing such deep wisdom! (wrings hands in despair). Bitcoin is doing okay, though. You have to admit..it always bounces back.

Bitcoin faces many problems, but it always faces them head-on and comes back smiling. You have to admire that It's a great lesson for life.

Her hair? LOL...maybe she's trying out a new, more modern style.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:44:38
My thoughts on Bitcoin are the same as always; it's worth holding on because in the end, you'll be glad you did.
@_date: 2018-07-27 06:37:00
Just watching and waiting.
@_date: 2018-07-25 17:48:09
There's always news about Bitcoin....

So Kim Kardashian has taken to Bitcoin? It's nice that she's told the world. More endorsement, it means. She has a huge audience.

Guess who's worried about their lifesavings? Ha ha. If Bitcoin is a scam, he's sunk. No wonder he went crazy.
