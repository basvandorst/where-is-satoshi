Sell, plenty will buy your discount coin. You shouldn't be in btc if you can't handle the swings.

Do you know how markets work?

thank you! why am I getting hit with down votes for solid advice??

"Like I said, I'm a smart person."
I stopped reading there

$35 dollars in btc isn't a lot. What would you do with $35 in real life? 
You could cloud mine with it, but it isn't likely you would get your money back for a variety of reasons.
Best case just hold it and buy more. HODL

Always buy the dip! Not a peak
@_date: 2016-06-13 07:17:20
Correct, it was apart of the gold lifetime package

I should add that you might want to consider ethereum mining, also offered by genesis. In hindsight this is what I should have done because it's the most profitable right now and the difficulty isn't anywhere near btc's. You can also choose which coins you want to mine (doge, dash, etc)  by splitting your hash power between them.

I also have a friend doing this. Using money you don't have does not sound smart to me...
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:28:58
You said you bought for 730? You'd willingly take a loss? It will go back up. It's just a matter of time, whether it be days (probably), months or years. 
Again, if you need the money now, invest in something other than btc
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:51:36
Actually genesis is legit, but LIKE I SAID IN MY POST you won't get your money back. The difficulty increases at a rate that outpaces your initial investment.

We need more people like you on this sub.
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:12:56
is coinbase really this bad about exchanging?
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:59:40
Are there any "risks" in cloud mining?
Yes, there are. You may not get your money back if you cloud mine or if the difficulty of bitcoin outpaces your initial investment. Fortunately, genesis is legit from what I can tell, although others, which I won't mention here, are most certainly ponzi schemes.
What was your experience with this?
I bought a contract from genesis after a lot of research. All positive, daily payouts. Throw me a bone and use my code if you use genesis. Gives you a 3% break on whatever you buy. Q7jbz3

Buy them on exchanges...

I bought 30 dollars or .1500 terahashs of power. Not a lot, but that's because it was/is an experimental investment. At this rate, it pays out roughly 0.00028k satoshi per day, or $1.35 a week. You can extrapolate that data higher or lower depending on your price range.

Thank you for linking this. Much needed at this time, even more so in the future
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:20:55
The contract is a bit misleading -- it will only mine for as long as the power is still profitable. Once it isn't (when the difficulty gets too high) it will stop. You should have you money back by that time however and a little more
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:33:43
Must be. I've seen a steady drop from 690-660 in last 15 min on coinbase, but holding a steady 700 on kraken/ bitcoin average
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:14:10
Long term holders mining = proof of stake. That's what the guy above is saying.
@_date: 2016-06-14 05:57:32
where are you getting these numbers from?
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:44:39
One thing is certain about bitcoin -- nothing is certain. 'The price most certainly' increasing sounds great on paper, but risking 20k of money you don't have? In my friend's case he will have to pay for college either way. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 03:16:49
First off. You aren't going to get rich quick off stocks or bitcoin. 5-10% a year is actually really good and compounded over the course of 30-40 years ends up being a lot of money.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a wild card. No one really knows what the future holds for bitcoin. If you don't have a 6 months of living wages saved in an emergency account then I wouldn't invest in stocks, let alone bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:36:14
There's two ways of rewarding: Proof of Stake and Proof of Work. Bitcoin is proof of work, while proof of stake rewards members for holding an asset over time.

nice blog post

$5 under the price? it's got to be 20 bucks at the least and even then with how volatile it's been that's low.
