The difference is that with BCH, that blocksize is unavoidably used by default (assuming enough transactions), whereas with BTC, its an option for people and businesses to adopt, and it is more complicated to implement

Orrrr just have a solution built in that doesn't require every exchange and wallet to spend time and money developing an adaptation

It's currently an artificially limited resource. Why should everyone else try to work around this? Why not adapt and stop blaming everyone else for not doing workarounds? Segwit was always an option, hence the soft fork. 
2mb makes fuck all difference to centralisation and node ownership. You can buy a hard drive now that holds the entire blockchain for the price of a single bitcoin transaction.
Don't get me wrong I admit that IF everyone used segwit we would be better off, but that's not happening overnight by any means. It's up to bitcoin to adapt, not everyone else.

Enough for right now, enough for 1 month from now

If you think 1mb is fine for now when then mempool has recently peaked at 290k unconfirmed transactions, and the average tx fee was $30 then I have nothing more to say to you. You clearly don't know what you are talking about.

Because you are playing the blame game. 3 transactions per second is pitiful, everyone shouldn't have to bend backwards to preserve this shitty state of affairs 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:57:20
I'm confused, do you really think 1mb is enough?

Again, this backlog is not because of "poor behaviour", people move money, buy things, and transact with friends. That's the vast majority of what is causing this backlog. NOT poor behaviour. Your mindset baffles me

Yeah i understand this, but 8mb blocks is never going to have a centralising effect. In 2 years, expanding to another 1tb HDD is going to be significantly cheaper. 
There is no logical or scientific explanation for not changing to larger blocks NOW, to reduce transaction fees massively and ease this backlog. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:41:46
Won't lightning network hubs end up centralising the network more than 8mb blocks? 
You can get a 1tb HDD for $60 - $100, that will last for over 2 years of full 8mb blocks. That's pretty cheap and hardly centralising in my opinion.

Irresponsible and wreckless? Yes because every bitcoin transaction is irresponsible and wreckless /s
More people use bitcoin every day, therefore the blocks get fuller and fuller. This is nothing to do with being irresponsible. You can't keep blaming everyone else
