That's so goddamn condescending.  Not to mention naive.  If someone's going to do heroin, they're going to do it anyway

Because the privacy of the student trumps the convenience of the public.  For real.  Most schools won't volunteer this information even for a job search without at least the students permission

Largest network I think would be harder to penetrate?
That's what I would guess he meant.
Larger distribution of computing power dedicated to it would make it harder and cost prohibitive to try to make up 51%

Is this the end of the road for the online drug market?

If one alt coin is being mined by 12 people, then all I need to do is double that computing power.  A large agency could reasonably do that to any coin that wasn't distributed well or enough.
If one entity controls a large chunk of computing power, then I can manipulate that entity.   He's saying bitcoin is safest because the most individuals over the greatest area are investing computing power.  So it would be most expensive to gain control of.   By orders of magnitude more than is feasible

Young people built the atom bomb and put us on the moon.  Those young people then got old.
The average age at NASA during Apollo 11 was like 26

The idea of soylent (currently in its infancy) will likely merge with the idea of lab grown meat

Dude fuck that guy.  It's a great idea.  The specific application isn't nearly as important as the initial implementation.
The first Webcam was used to monitor a coffee pot down the hall.  This is the kind of thing that builds on previous ideas, and is later used in things that had nothing to do with the original idea.
Just because a vending machine already exists doesn't mean this idea doesn't have merit.  It's just one more piece to the Internet of Things, and block chain enabled devices, and universal everything.
I like it.  It doesn't have to be a vending machine. It doesn't even have to be a lock. 
It's easy to criticize, it's a lot harder to create

What if you had 25,000 bulbs in the same pool
@_date: 2015-05-16 21:32:00
All of the ideas that you could use this for already exist.  And work better now as they are.  Coin op lockers, parking gates, vending machines.. etc.
But by creating the method to allow this alternative way, you will be opening up entirely new approaches that aren't currently used because people don't even realize that it's possible.  You know?
I don't understand that guys perspective.  I think it's been common of naysayers throughout history.  Discouraging new approaches because the old way is good enough.  
Wright brothers weren't trying to replace trains, or get to the moon.
People scoffed at their toy.. "I can get across America by rail in only a week!  Your bicycle stays aloft less than a minute"
Why bother trying to find an alternative?  What's wrong with the train?
I don't understand that kind of thinking, but I suppose it might be useful if only to encourage the Wright brothers in proving them wrong.

How'd it go?
@_date: 2015-05-16 21:26:02
There are other suggestions littered all over this thread, but my first thought on lock was something like a parking lot.  When you enter you get a little ticket, and then you pay and it lifts the gate.
You could be assigned an address when you enter, and when it has the funds it "unlocks" your account.
Others suggested bus station lockers.
I really think that the idea itself is more important than the specific application right now.  Similar to the block chain itself.  We still aren't sure exactly how it will be used or be most useful.  
The proof of concept is the important bit.
Do you plan to actually try to implement this?
@_date: 2016-12-29 06:32:36
Imagine if "Best performing asset of 2016" is a headline you could actually purchase for an investment that you hold.
Who knows, man.  Probably, tbh
Maybe the hacker known as 4chan bought them as last minute gifts, and then spent their christmas cash on more

Instead of raising block size has there been any suggesting of making it more frequent?
Make the blocks 1/5 the size and have them confirm every 2 minutes
@_date: 2015-08-13 18:48:11
Thank you for explaining that
@_date: 2015-08-13 18:47:16
Does that generally take a bit?
I'm very interested in bitcoin but unfortunately still have a very rudimentary idea of how it all works
