Yea I mean investing in gold futures is thousands of dollars for like every penny it ticks, predictions are sooo time sensitive in anything related to money, it makes me laugh when these pundits talk out of their ass and say they called the correction correctly when they've been talking about impending recession for years

Where are you getting this information from? I've managed to accumulate 1btc I first got into it around $300 sold it all at $800 then just recently averaged in around $10k. I'm just curious to read the analysis or experts that say this is going to moon. Obviously I believe so but it doesn't seem as certain as you say.

After that story of local Bitcoin holding like 9 bitcoins of someone from 2016 I'd rather stay away from them
@_date: 2019-08-22 18:06:36
Cool well that's enough hype to fuel my excitement to more accumulation lol. People need to make sure to max out their Roth and 401k with some traditional stock ETFs at least that's what I do, auto paycheck deduction to safe stuff then if if in the unlikely case I lose my ass on Bitcoin I have a reasonable safety net in the retirement accounts.

It's ludicrous to me to leave that amount of cash on an exchange. Unless he is just THAT rich and it's only like 10% of his money. I don't think he has any legal recourse here since it's a crime, unless it was an employee that committed the crime in which case he could definitely get all that money back in the lawsuit
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:26:14
Are you a moron only capable of repeating canned memes? Lol just because someone used an exchange to make money doesn't mean they can't make money off selling the coin. It's a financial instrument, you just sell at a profit I don't need to physically own those it's the discretionary spending fund
@_date: 2019-10-24 20:17:30
I admit I don't know much about eth but do consider it in the same tier of "safe" as Bitcoin.

Lol I have a ledger dumbass but nice job assuming. If it goes to $100,000 I'll have sold my Robinhood amount at $20,000 anyways so victory
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:09:19
I have 2btc actually in a ledger.  And within Robinhood I've got the proxy for BTC which will be sold for cash to make profit, and the money saved is on expense fees. Profit equals revenue minus cost :) so my profit will be higher when I sell the proxy for btc in Robinhood because I paid no fees. Not sure why this is so hard for you to understand lol

To back you up even more- the Winklevoss twins view it as a store of value as well. There's a great book out about them that covers how they discovered it then led to Gemini etc. Supposedly they are still holding that initial Bitcoin and probably met Satoshi just didn't realize it
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:15:05
This noob doesn't even understand basic economics bro. Sell low because it's only gonna go lower, then buy once it moons since at that point it's going to $100,000, bro
@_date: 2019-08-24 21:08:52
It's a lot for someone under 30. Past that and if you don't have 100k net worth it's kinda a squandered youth. So yea this dude is just bragging seeking validation

The same investment principles that apply to buy and hold stocks apply here. Ok the price went down. Has my investment thesis aka why I invested in the first place changed? No. Ok, so continue as planned and hold for a year minimum through the halvening. Maybe at this point if anyone is down too much stop buying more, but there's no reason to sell just hold it like you told yourself you'd hold it and don't panic sell. Don't be stupid and convince yourself it's on sale until you have no cash left though, because then if the economy does crash and you need money you're fucked. When I say "you" I'm not talking to this poster I'm replying to just in general since this was a good comment.
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:08:55
I'm still using Robinhood because anyone who has more than $1000 in BTC would be silly not to honestly. Sure it's uninsured, but basically they would have to go bankrupt and lose everyone's money to lose mine. The fees on coinbase and gemini were about $35 per grand. Think like $7 if you only want to buy $100. PLUS coinbase sells it to you above market value at a worse rate than Robinhood when I've compared. Especially since I like smooth averaging in small amounts it's especially convenient. Like I've saved probably $500 on fees from Robinhood but I also can't sell for more than a year so you're right I'm kinda fucked and can't spend it since I want to lock in the long term tax rate on it but I hodl anyways

Same reason a company might dilute it's stock and sell more shares. It makes the company money. It doesn't make an investor who isn't part of the company any money, it just dilutes their holding. Ripple generated revenue and customers by giving out their coin, someone who is just holding the coin experiences inflation. Same as a bank printing money. Bitcoin is decentralized so from my understanding they would have to come to a concensus to create more coins, which wouldn't happen since so many disagreeing people would have to agree.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:54:33
Yea btc is the only one I know of where some corrupt few top people can't just ruin it for everyone. Most companies in this space make money surrounding BTC services not actually from just holding it, that's why they may not care about day to day price fluctuation
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:55:15
I know I dumped all my litecoin in favor of BTC, I was holding xrp bags for 3 years and that crap only ever goes down since they keep pumping out a higher supply. Eth hasn't increased supply yet, but they've said they would consider it as well so I'm sticking with the coin that won't dilute itself
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:35:24
I'm the guy you're replying to and I agree with what you've said but keep in mind my concern isn't the limit orders I don't do short term like you're saying I do buy low and hold. I actually never sell lol so I'm contradictory I know. Cheers buddy I wish you lots of money and good quality of life and much fortune. Sorry if I seemed like a cunt I was mad about other life stuff. I hope we all succeed
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:25:08
Oh I guess true. The question here is: where is the line of reasonable liability that a corporation is expected to have. He was their customer expecting his information to be protected, which is normal. So in a civil case the fact that this company let his account be defrauded.  Definitely seeming more like a settlement would come out of it
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:36:31
Exactly. Shit like this is funny to me because non Americans assume we follow the law. The US is the most distrustful population of their government of all the developed world. Even China, people actually trust their government more because of the brainwashing propaganda. Many take this freedom for granted, but it's what makes the US unique.

Thanks for the detailed response! Appreciate the last comment, but I'm doing pretty well safe job and a couple retirement accounts, but I put all of my disposable income in Bitcoin and have the retirement funds as backup no matter what I won't be screwed age 65 I'll just not be rich worst case scenario. Gratitude and building relationships are definitely important things in life money isn't everything for sure.
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:16:41
Oh wow I can pay $365 a month, almost 5grand annually, to go through this hassle to avoid taxes? Wow what a luxurious convenience lol. Dude just think about the opportunity cost of paying that much monthly versus you know actually investing it in the crypto then tell me with a straight face it's a good deal for the consumer
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:55:27
I do that but Robinhood gold doesn't give margin on crypto and no brokerage really does. So I use margin for regular stocks then only hodl 1 coin
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:16:41
Oh ok still a $365 initiation fee though
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:42:51
Out of the loop- could anyone please explain where this quantum fear came from suddenly? My friend said he's not accumulating more because of quantum computing, but that wouldn't have the technology to break 256 encryption for many more years. Fear mongering so people can buy up cheap possibly?
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:43:55
Oh god dude I was gonna get a hardware wallet now this seed you planted is giving me serious doubts. Never underestimate corporate greed there are countless examples of company execs taking all the money for themselves and declaring bankruptcy or just saying the customers funds were hacked. What do you recommend? Obviously an exchange is just as bad if not worse, and paper keys are way too risky.
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:33:40
Thanks for the elaboration. I see now it seems the guy I responded to was making a joke that went over my head about how anything can be compromised and "unsafe" if you dig into the minutiae enough. Definitely trust trezor 100% more than an exchange though that's for sure so I'm waiting until Robinhood allows transfer of coins and will put it all in hardware wallets
@_date: 2019-09-01 14:11:50
I just keep like a grand in the big alts like eth and ltc just in case, but they're not a safe bet at all
