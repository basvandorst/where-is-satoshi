Just tried it again, after entering my credentials it goes to the enter an Authy code to log in page.
You can check the option to not ask for a code for 30 days.  Maybe you did that sometime?

Yep, anyone that says something good about Coinbase is a shill or fanboy, has nothing to do with the fact that their website is professional looking and a vast majority of transactions with them go through flawlessly.  Point me to a better USD/BTC/BTC&gt;USD that does business in the US that has a site that's as easy to use as Coinbase.
Edit: I'm assuming the down votes without a reply with a better company means one doesn't exist?  This is why a lot of non early adopters think Bitcoin is a scam.  *We don't like one of the only sites that doesn't look like a scam but we're not going to tell you why and we're not going to give you an alternative, oh and we're going to call you names while we're at it*.  Seriously, if you all want to further Bitcoin along to wider adoption you need to stop being pretentious assholes.

I have used my Chase account to purchase from Coinbase, several times.  No issues at all.  There's something else to this.

or, could it be that Coinbase actually comes across as a halfway professional company in a sea of worthlessness?

I'm not on the list and have not received any scam/phishing emails lately, but I do have a Coinbase account.

I signed in yesterday and used 2FA and it's always logged me off after 10 minutes or so of inactivity.

So, removing viruses/malware is something anti-virus/malware software shouldn't do?  Wat?

Here's how I made Bitcoin mining.
1. Buy USB ASICs for $30 on Amazon.
2. Mine for 2 weeks.
3. Realize that it's never going to pay off.
4. Sell as used on Amazon for $50.
5. Buy Bitcoins with profit.

I've never had a single problem funding from a Chase account and every one of my purchases Bitcoin had gone up in price after I placed the order.  Granted all of my purchases have been under $1000.

The only thing I can think of is that he was running a business out of his personal checking account and he didn't want to switch to a business checking account, that has fees, when Chase approached him.

An investment trust that holds Bitcoin as its asset, ~174k BTC in total.  Each share represents about one tenth of a Bitcoin.  Trades at a premium to Bitcoin since it can be purchased like a normal stock.

GBTC.  1 share ~= 0.1 BTC.  Pretty high fees and trades at a premium to Bitcoin. 
Whether or not to invest in GBTC vs buying bitcoin directly is a pretty divisive topic, but if you want to get BTC in your IRA it's a simple way to do so.  It's also cashing out its BCH holdings over the next few months so there should be a dividend soonish.

Hmm... I should start bitchcoin.  I mean, I'd already have some good advertising in place.  I'll even make the change between Btch, mBtch, and uBtch at every users whim, maybe start out at aBtch and make people feel special.

I would fully expect you to get your coins on the 20th.  The coins I have that went pending on a Friday I ended up receiving the following Friday.
