Kodak was my signal that shit is about to hit the fan. 
I think crypto will eventually be a game-changer, but I think we're going to suffer a huge storm of crashing alts (or BTC itself) and stocks of companies who tried to cash in on the trend. It'll be rocky, but I think the tech will win out in the end..

Yep. Too many people think "bubble" means "going to die." It just means crypto will *change*. 
We are tracking right along the typical bubble curve. Currently looks like we may be at the "denial" phase after leaving the bull trap. Of course, we may be too close to the data to tell! This could reverse tomorrow and hit a new ATH for the next 5 years, and these dips resolve to a pretty standard upward line. 
It's incredibly interesting to watch. I just hope people heeded our warnings to not over-invest.

I thought that looked like a bull trap. Let's see what the next few days bring.

My thoughts exactly. This looks like a textbook bull trap.

"cut you for it" is a betting game. You both cut a deck of cards and reveal the bottom card. Either the high card or the low card wins (in this case, the high card). 
So we both cut, I draw a 2 and you draw a King. You win. 
The bet was for the dotcom millionaire's entire net worth. This signals that it's chump change to the billionaire.

So it has been 7 days. I don't know the exact time of the post, but the high from December 22 was ~15.5, low was ~10.9 (via coindesk). Current price has been between 14-15k today. 
I guess he's still got a half day for it to blow past 20k, but it looks like your left foot is safe.

Yeah, I can see how HODLers may jump to that conclusion, since there have been so many trolls in these threads. 
I've got no skin in this game, though. I'm just an accountant/tech geek who really likes watching history unfold. This will all be part of a finance/econ textbook in the next 10 years, I guarantee it.

I mean, I think this is a bull trap and the price will tank soon, but he at least offered *some* support for his claims. You offered none.

I was calling a bull trap last week, I may get to see if I was correct a lot sooner than expected. 
Regardless of outcome, this is seriously interesting from a finance perspective.

You're asking people to predict the future. His answer was sarcastic. 
If you think the price will go up, then now is a good time to buy. If you think this rebound was a bull trap and the price will drop soon, then this would be a bad time to buy.
But no one knows. We're all just making various degrees of educated guesses.

...by watching a price graph? 
Literally all of that information is based on a price graph (slight exception for bull trap, since you don't actually know it *was* a bull trap until afterwards. It's just that the sharp increase after a price drop *can* signal it)
ATH = All time high (in the last 52 weeks). I don't touch things near there unless I have  good reason to think it will continue/stay steady. I didn't think that with BTC, which is why I didn't buy in at 4k. Turns out it kept going, which means I lost out on a lot of gains. However, I didn't expose myself to any diversifiable risk, either. 
Large dip... Do I really need to explain this? It just happened. 
Stay = price stays relatively steady for a few weeks/months without significant gains or losses. 
Slowly start working upwards = the price has *slowly* increased. I don't have a hard number for this, but quick, large price gains make me nervous. 
It's just a really conservative investment strategy. Most of my investment goes into my 401k and Roth. What I invest myself I'm pretty risk-averse with. 
However, BTC's performance lately has proven to me that it has *some* real value, eventually. At least, it's made me willing to risk some money on it at some point (whenever I feel more comfortable). The sheer name recognition tells me that it or BCH could be game changers later.

Hopefully super cheap BTC. I've been holding out for the bubble to pop for a month now. I don't ever buy near the ATH, but a sharp rebound after a large dip can signal a bull trap. I'm looking for it to drop, stay, then slowly start working upwards over a few days/weeks.

Yep. This is why speculation is generally known as a fancy word for "gambling". Except the big players have expensive simulators and researchers to give them an edge, and the little players get a few price graphs provided by the big players. 
Taking out a bank loan for speculating/beating the curve is exactly what causes financial ruin. It happened to Iceland, it happened to the timeshare billionaire, it happens to compulsive gamblers. Eventually, you will regress to the mean.
