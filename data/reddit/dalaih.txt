Hold on, let me look for a vimeo or other links.   
It's called "the 10 Million Dollar end game" or something

Kraken pays their employees in BTC, find a boss who'd pay you in BTC.

I'm working on better titles,  I'll try not to disappoint next time. I hope you'd let this one slip by.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:46:50
I'll do better next time, I promise. :)

Here's the [video]( It talks about what is bitcoin, how it works, why is it valuable, what stage are we at when we compare bitcoin to the internet.

You've got these options with [bitrefill](

Okay, here's an alternate link from another channel.

Youtube took the video down.

It may be easier and faster to purchase a hardware wallet on Amazon but I, personally won't risk it.

Holy shit!I am not kidding here, I was just watching it right now and after reading your comment, I refreshed my browser and I see that too, strange and it isn't available on the creators channel too.
Fcking youtube

In your example you are not paying for the car with bitcoin, but with $$.   
When bitcoin achieves mass adoption we won't be using fiat to settle transactions. To purchase a car priced at 0.00003 BTC and you will pay 0.00003 BTC

The device can be tampered or might come with an existing seed phrase. Most new users would think the seed phrase came with the wallet which isn't true. Seed phrase is generated when you set up your device
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:22:49
Yes, I am out too
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:21:28
No clue, really. It was strange how it got taken down or deleted. I was 30 mins into it, when I posted it the first time. After reading the first comment of the link not working, I refreshed my browser and **poof** it was gone.

Yes, this is his 2nd interview. 1st was back in 2015 I think.   
[In case if you are looking for his 2015 interview](

oh wow, thanks for that tip.  It worked on Chrome. Wasn't working on Brave.

Lol stay away from anyone giving you free BTC

He wants to invest $200 now and sell when it reaches 20k to buy a new phone and wants to know how he can use BTC to buy a phone. 
u/btreur If you are in the U.S, you can use bitrefill to buy Amazon gift cards or use moonpay.io browser extension and pay directly with BTC on Amazon.com

This video deserves a spot on the stickies or in the about of this sub. Doesn't matter how many times it was posted, i think.
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:38:20
The 2nd video isn't public yet.   
I logged in using email, but can't play the video because of the videos privacy setting.   
It's hosted on [vimeo]( and set to private for now, I think.

I'd advice to go for a paper wallet instead of a hardware wallet for now. Although hardware wallets are the most secured but you may not want to spend on a hardware wallet for just 50 AUD worth of bitcoins. On the flip side offline paper wallet are equally secured provided you keep them somewhere safe and don't lose them and they are free. Go to  to make one.

The energy used to run the Bitcoin network atm doesn't matter. Bitcoin in a nutshell is financial stability at cost of energy consumption.
