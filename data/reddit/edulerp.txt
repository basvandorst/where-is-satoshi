The coin one is faster tho

I'd recommend [coindeal.com]( because it offers various trading tools. For example, galaxy score tells you the condition of a coin of your choice like bitcoin.

Coindeal. It supports new technologies like SegWit and gives discounts to the users with the SegWit address.

I'm not so sure if buying bitcoin anonymously is safe, many  of websites which allow you to do that is just a scam.... Better use realiable exchanges like for example CoinDeal or Kraken. In that way you can be sure that your coins and money are safe.

Buy the dip!

You're doing your part.
And how about you, random Reddit user? What did you do today to popularize Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:13:11
Gotta hold as if my BTC was a lifebuoy.

Well, CoinDeal is soon going to be available in the US, so I'd go for it if I were you. It has free deposits via bank transfer and if you're a SegWit user, you get a 50% discount on your BTC withdrawals.

Pretty accurate

It's funny because it's true.

Dear [**u/Mnmsaregood,**]( remember that the amount of money you own doesn't define you nor how cool you are. You have a strong comment and post karma and you received a silver badge in the last 30 days. For me, you're pretty cool :D

\- it has around 50 cryptos (BTC as well ;) ) and 7 fiats 
\- if you're a SegWit user, you get a 50% discount on BTC withdrawals
\- free deposits via bank transfer
\- very secure (VQF, SSL, 90% of coins are held in cold wallets)
\- voting system - users choose next crypto to be added to the platform
\- lots of payment methods (for example VISA, Skrill)
\- no limits of the amount of BTC you can buy 
\- useful tools (like Galaxy Score - it tells you the condition of a coin)
In general, CoinDeal is worth checking out. I'm using it since the beginning of the year and faced no problems so far.

Not to mention that when you try to buy BTC on [bitcoin.com]( you're redirected to buy bitcoin cash. It can't be more scammy, in my opinion.

I'd go for CoinDeal. It is currently in the process of joining the US market. It's an extremely secure exchanger with around 50 coins, lots of fiats and various payment methods. It also gives its users free 100 coindeal tokens. And if you're a SegWit user, you'll get a 50% discount on BTC withdrawals.
