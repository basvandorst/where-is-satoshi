I don't have a hotspot on my phone but I'll wait til my roommate gets home.
I'm using 3.2.3 which is likely the problem but it worked fine until very recent. 
Thank you, though, how do I make sure I don't get phished? By downloading from the right site / make sure nothing extra installs?

I don’t have much to be paranoid about as I only have like $160 in it but I appreciate it! It would definitely suck to lose it/fuck up my system so I’ll try this tonight. This was very detailed and not a lot of people care to give out info like that so thank you I really appreciate it.

It seriously worked like 3 weeks ago when I bought seeds of the vault. But no doubt

Okay, thanks for the advice. I do care about privacy but am extremely busy these upcoming weeks. I'll try to look into how those work. Should I be okay if I just download from electrum.org with homebrew and everything?

I have terminal in my utilities folder but I don't know much about it. What does netcat do/why would I need it?
When I type: vps.hsmiths.com.server:50002 into my browser it says: This site can't be reached \_\_\_\_'s server IP address not found. So does that mean someone's not blocking it because it doesn't say connection refused?
