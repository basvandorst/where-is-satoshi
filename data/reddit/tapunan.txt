Based on that chart, assuming the pattern continues - we're looking at Bitcoin possibly going down back to around 2000 dollars as the pattern shows the price going back to near the previous high price before going up again. If this happens, it's going to be fun reading reddit posts  :)

And assuming Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates themselves have not secretly been buying  and Hodling :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:04:57
Agree with this. I'm in the IT Field and among my colleagues, only one bought when it was around 2,500 Australian dollars (about 1900 USD) and he only bought because of FOMO coz I was talking about Bitcoin since the price was about 1,200 Australian dollars. My other IT colleagues kept calling it worthless, tulip-mania ... 
They would say " why would people buy it, there's no use, you can't buy anything with it and so on" .. I countered with Japan using it and big stores implementing it; it Australia, you can pay utility bills with it - they still thought it was worthless. Funny thing now, they are the ones who keep bringing up the price of Bitcoin BUT still with the mentality that it's worthless - like "I can't believe people pay 15,000 Australia dollars each)". They seem to be more obsessed with it than me and my other colleague (we're of the HODL mentality). 
One of them even said, "oh, it's going to go down to 3,000 Australian dollars when the Bitcoin futures market in the US start" - at that point, I've already given up arguing  :)
It's like they have a FOMO mentality but also don't want to buy so they're just following the price and looking for excuses to justify not buying it.
Anyway, back to my main point, Bitcoin has been in the news a lot in Australia but asking around, from me and my wife's office (she works in the Financial industry also) - not many people really invest in it. And this is Bitcoin, other crypto-currencies are in an even worst place of not being in the news at all so nobody knows about them. I'd say even less then 2 or 3%.

Same can be said for any other investments - stocks, bonds, properties, artworks and so on. If you buy anything for investment, make sure not to sell low and make sure not to invest money that you can't afford to lose so that you can make it through any price corrections.
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:36:38
I'm actually happy to read this - coz when people say - "Bitcoin is in a bubble, people are just buying due to FOMO, prices will crash soon" and so on - I always felt we're still in the early phases and not many common people actually know about it or believe and invest in it - these comments somehow validate it.
That and the fact that except for one guy - none of my other colleagues in the tech field have invested in Bitcoin. My relatives have never even heard of it except when I asked them about it.

If they do this (ie dedicate a single nuclear plant to mining), can Russia theoretically do a 50% attack on Bitcoin ? 
Hmmmm, for conspiracy theorists, maybe their aim is to control bitcoin - think about it, this is going to be Government-backed mining operation. 
If China does the same thing and both countries go back-and-forth increasing the mining difficulty - it might concentrate mining power to 2 governments, what will this do to Bitcoin ?

At first glance, I thought that was what McAfee was supposed to eat.
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:08:55
She may be right about the companies themselves but let's be realistic, most people who have access to these use them. I use Uber, PayPal, visa and Facebook (though not that much lately but not due to FB the company, just got tired of too much food, selfie and lazy posts). 
But anyway, most people I know do use them. You may hate Uber the company but I prefer travelling and booking Uber over taxis. I've had PayPal transactions returned when the sellers didn't post. I just don't know why I'd use FB coins to pay but we'll see when it comes out. 
I hope the teams behind each crypto are realistic in acknowledging that the Facebook coin MAY pose a threat and that they should upgrade and surpass whatever FB comes out with. Rather than simply dismissing it bec it's evil.

Over 11k!!! I didn't jinx it ������
@_date: 2019-06-09 01:25:54
And even if they know about it - I doubt a lot of people would invest in it. I've mentioned this before - I'm a web developer - in my IT team - I first talked about Butcoin 2016 - my techie teammates ignored me. 
When it rose one of them bought - the others just called it a tulip craze and a saying it's just one of those "Greater Fool" speculative items. When it went up 2017 and down 2018 they said - see - we told you - it's going back down - better sell to the next fool.
Just this year - another one bought - the others still talk about it but still have the same tulip view point. And this is just in my team - we work with finance people - the few that I ask I think last year barely heard of it - just that they see it in the news ... so yeah - we are in very early times.
The question is are we fools holding fool's gold or early adopters - only time will tell.

@_date: 2019-06-27 00:48:08
Yeah but there are people who expect pullbacks - that's where I'm curious at. 
If people think 13k is good enough and sell - I understand but to expect a pullback down to say 9k and below (from some technical analyst) - someone should be selling at 9k and below - why !?!?! after seeing it go to 13k ?
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:24:42
I remember explaining to my wife about Bitcoin and when it came to validating and PoW - she asked me - so who puts up the mining computers. I said anonymous people around the world. She then asked - so you don't know who's validating your money. Why would they do it for free ? What if they are hackers? I explained the whole concept behind it, mining fee but she still didn't trust the validating system coz they are unknown.
Imagine now Facebook saying - we have validators - they are Mastercard, Visa, Spotify, Uber, PayPal ... now imagine my wife and other people like young millennials hearing this - if they ever decide to experiment with digital coins - which one do you think they will use and trust ?
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:51:14
Why do you need to install a bitcoin wallet first?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:49:04
Yeah, depends on the country - in Australia - the tax office specifically mentions this (copied directly from their website) - "Where you use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use or consumption, any capital gain or loss from disposal of the bitcoin will be disregarded (as a personal use asset) provided the cost of the bitcoin is $10,000 or less."
Not 100% about the "10,000" part - I assume this is the transaction cost in dollars of what was paid in bitcoin. This means buy Lambos will be taxed  :)
OP should ask an accountant knowledgeable in Bitcoin or ask the tax office themselves. In Australia, using bitcoin is the only way I can think of to avoid tax completely - so better find out how it is in the USA.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:06:52
another alternative - index funds (ie Vanguard) - probably safer than bitcoin - but with less profits - but remember in investments - less risk=less profit / high profit = high risk.
I also agree with others when they mention risks with Bitcoin, it's a high-risk investment - same with other cryptocoin. Always be on the look-out for news that may affect it ... though in my personal opinion - it's probably 'safe' until the next halving in 2020, as I'm pretty sure the next halving will raise it's price more - after that - who knows ?
@_date: 2019-06-11 08:04:45
I did the same thing or should I say WANT to... 
My nephew in my wife's side just graduated from computer science.. Told him to download an android wallet and to give me the receiving address... He said thanks but that was that.. He hasn't contacted me yet about the address and I won't remind him.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:11:54
In his defense - his logic was kinda sound. Ignoring all his other reasoning, his basic reasoning came down to - if BCH and BCG fork went through - B2X surely would've gone through with no problem.
Unfortunately, it didn't - too bad for him.
I just hope he followed the usual advice of investing money that he can lose.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:57:41
Yeah, that's why I was wondering why the image seems to give this huge importance to the guy not installing a wallet first. He can always buy first, in fact KYC requirements at exchanges would take longer than a wallet installation.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:20:25
I think what some people wanted to see as the title us " So apparently there are only 70 days that Bitcoin has been unprofitable to buy. This means that if you’ve bought Bitcoin at any random point in time **and HODL since buying** \- there’s a 98.17% chance that you’re profitable **if you sold today**"
Sure, there are lots of days that if you bought and sold when price went down you will not be profitable but from what the OP wrote - I think not selling is his main message.. just HODL and sell only when profitable. 
Even other investments like stocks/gold are the same thing, if you don't sell at a loss, you will only be losing in paper and not in reality. Hence why most advice about stocks say it's a long-term strategy - like 10 years or more - if you need the money earlier than that they recommend a HISA (high interest savings account)
@_date: 2019-04-05 03:06:17
You maybe right - can't understand half the stuff in that chart - hence my last point  :) 
But in my opinion you cannot discount and say Bitcoin as payment is the last step - I think it being slowly used as a payment system will "level up" the fundamental values in this chart.
Hmmmm if I read some correctly - let's say the "greater acceptability and recognizability" - I'm reading this from common man's point of view which is recognizability by the common person - acceptability by the common person - if this is some sort of techie buzzword then I'm mistaken and ignore this paragraph. But if this is what I think it is ? How would say acceptability increase and be possible for Bitcoin if it's not be used as payments ? Store of value ? Recognizability - same thing, people know what Bitcoin is or have heard of it but unless it's used 
Also, reliable store of value = reliability to store in what way ? The recent New York Times pointed to this when it was compared to stocks - if someone steals your stocks - you can trace and recover - if someone steals your bitcoin - it will be hard to trace and recover and most likely it will be lost.
Price Stability - unless Bitcoin is owned by a lot of people or it's price increases to a high point, price can easily be manipulated and will never be stable. Unless of course some exchanges introduce controls like in stock exchanges that stops specific shares from being traded if the price swings a lot - obviously this will never happen.
In the end though, I actually agreed with you - we are still very early in Adoption. And again, in my opinion and this is for Bitcoin not other crypto; for Bitcoin to be adopted - I think all the steps in your chart is intertwined with it being used as Payment.

Widespread adoption 
  \- when big companies accept it readily and make it available (eBay, Amazon, Utility companies and so on) in their checkout - if people go to check-out - hopefully payment by Crypto should there (people should not have to buy gift cards somewhere else first)
  \- small shops should accept it like say accept Apple Pay (my wife loves this) - just buy and pay with your phone
  \- when there's someone people can turn to if something happens (credit card gets stolen/hacked - report to bank - actually happened to me, bank reimbursed everything; vendor is a scammer - PayPal can reimburse you) ... Crypto wallet gets hacked - sorry - you just lost everything
   \- When really big companies adopt and push for it as a payment option for small companies - Apple Pay, Google Pay.
  \- last, when people can come up with explanations that the common person can understand  :) I read this chart - can't understand it (Convenient Unit of Account - what the heck does that mean ??)  :)
anyway, whether we want it or not - in my opinion, for real widespread adoption, we need banks, credit cards and governments to somehow cooperate. 
Do you think PayPal would've been popular if you needed to say buy a Paypal coin or something and that if you lost it - you lose everything - as a common person - I love Paypal bec I can pay via my credit card and still have the Paypal dispute option in case some vendors don't send their stuff (happened to me a few times with eBay stuff). Same way with Apple Pay, convenience of the phone but you still need credit cards to link to it.

Agree with this sentiment. This does several things :
1. Remind people to only invest money that they can afford to lose.
2. Allow me and other people to get in at a cheaper price again.
3. I'm actually on the side of people that believe regulations is still important in Crypto. We may tend to imagine a world where crypto is replaced by dollars but in reality, people want regulations in one-way or another - to protect as from fraudalent exchanges, financial spending stupidity (ie ICO). I actually believe adding regulations will bring more mainstream people in.

Isn't this an old FUD news? 
If I'm not mistaken - the proposal only prevents transactions using $10,000 of PHYSICAL cash from being used to avoid money laundering and criminals from being able to dispose of their cash. Cheques/credit cards are not part of this. And this is only for Individual-&gt;Company transactions - it stated that individual transactions (like second hand car sales) are exempted.
I mean when was the last time someone actually carried around $10,000 in cash to pay for stuff? Imagine someone going to a jewelry shop carrying a suitcase full of cash and wanting to use that to pay - kinda suspicious right?

I wonder how normal Chinese investors are feeling - either they sold when it crashed or they're holding - see the price surge - but can't sell.

So not sure what you mean ? If it's for second hand car - the bill allows it - you can pay in cold hard cash :) .. if buying from a car dealer - bank cheques, personal cheques is ok.

Baby steps. 
And from my point of view, even now with fiat, exchanges/gateway of some sort are needed ... Try paying with your local currency in another country, you most likely can't. Even credit cards are exchanged to the local currency used by the business. I know, I just got back from a holiday. 
This is how I look at it and realistically how businesses will look at it. Accepting crypto is like accepting credit cards, as long as it goes back to what businesses can use they will accept it and I'm ok with that. Credit card, apple pay, transportation card and now crypto via bitpay or whatever. 
Just a different point of view of adoption. Let them get used to it first.

Agree on the belief system - same way that Gold is more valuable than Silver (more industrial use) or Platinum (more rare). 
Or why a Diamond (not even rare) is super expensive. Belief whether by marketing or historical tradition dictates values of some stuff. 
For BTC, FOMO (for now) will most likely dictate it's value.

I also hope this means eBay will accept Cryptocurrencies but then again, if you look at the ad - it's just like a normal ad for eBay - "Reach 179 million active buyers in the world's largest marketplace." sounds like an ebay ad you will see in bus stops. Another states 'Digital Collectibles. It's happening in eBay' and 'Virtual Currency. It's happening in eBay' seems to just say you can buy these stuff in Ebay like 'Sports memorabilia or Game of Thrones collectibles - it's happening in eBay'.

IF Bitcoin goes that high - I will sell half and put a downpayment (or maybe buy outright) into a real-estate. This way even if Bitcoin goes up some more I still have half of my bitcoin to sell later. 
If it goes down, I would still have a property ... either way, I will have a property :)
So the question now is - will Bitcoin really go up that high :)
