Why Argentina? Inflation is out of control there

Uhh? Why do you think he is subject to US law? He obtained and leaked classified documents of the US government. You can't do that and then go "lol i'm not subject to your laws". Everyone in the world is subject to US law. Just because the US won't spend the effort to get you doesn't mean you aren't subject to their laws. Ask those Russian hackers who went on vacation to Latvia if they are subject to US law (hint: they are).


That wasn't why. The fact you think that shows you don't understand the situation. He is being charged for releasing thousands of unfiltered classified documents. If he wanted to go the journalist way he could have walked into any paper in the US with the evidence and it would have been an instant Pulitzer prize winning piece. Instead he leaked indiscriminately which directly leaked information about troops and assets that were not related at all to the incident you are referring to.

Paying $60 for a product and then not having it delivered for multiple months is ridiculous. Stop supporting companies that screw over their customers.

What are the choices for hardware wallets? All the ones I am seeing are $60 which is ridiculous.

Can you link me? I have a bet that the guy had extremely bad security practices.

That is understandable though. Why wouldn't you suspect coinbase (a relatively new business) over visa?

It's not and a search of the subreddit found nothing. 
The guy who lost the bitcoins installed a malicious chrome extension. His bitcoins were never safe. Even with a hardware wallet. A fool and his money are soon parted.

Good luck spending any of it without going to federal prison.

Spending those bitcoins would likely reveal his identity. Working for coinbase wouldn't do that.

US law applies worldwide.

What does working at coinbase have to do with anything?

You can't be saying stuff like this when 2 post above you were saying 
"Let's keep the discussion civil and professional". It is best to avoid taking the bait. When you take the bait you look stupid.

Not surprising. Countries like Vietnam and China don't want capital flight. Bitcoin makes it easy. That is why so many rich Chinese people are interested in bitcoin. People like Jihan Wu like bitcoin because it will allow them to easily leave to the west with tons of money.

What? No he hasn't
