It looks like they would have to know your master public key and 1 private key.
I do not plan to provide my master public key to anyone

There was apparently a BIP written, not sure of the number, that allowed you to time lock the next spend from a created UTXO.
This would have allowed the user to send the BTC to the attacker, it would have showed in the mempool, but miners wouldnt pick it up for X time (even without a block height on it).
There would then be the option to send an "emergency transaction" to yourself within the 24 hours in order to get back the funds.
Another option is that he could have used a block height that is infinitely high, and RBF, so the first transaction would never confirm due to the high block height, but RBF would allow him to change it.

It was working, but now it says "Coundn't finish all requested mixing rounds, BadRequest". Win7 x64
Do I have to keep HiddenWallet running while we wait on the mix?  Or has it already sent a signed transaction over to use ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:45:12
So just to be clear, I would have to keep HiddenWallet open and running until the mix actually happens ?
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:59:22
I was able to replicate. I closed hiddenwallet using the windows task manager after I hid it in windows (I couldn't figure out how to "unhide" the GUI once I hid it). Once I re opened hiddenwallet and tried the mix again I receive the error. 
I'm sure I could replicate it again if I tried. Seems like something is not being written out fully to disk when the application is force closed. 
I'll give it another go tomorrow removing my local data and re syncing. 
Just for reference, how do you "unhide" the GUI in windows once you use the GUI option to hide it?

in for some tBTC for the mix

any idea when Edge wallet for iOS will be available ?
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:26:58
I like to look at the bottom chart.  it shows what transactions and what sat/byte are in the mempool at that time.  Then you can use your own judgement to know what fee to use. 
As mentioned on the site, most of the time the top 1MB gets pulled off every block, so if you see .9 MB at 140 sat/byte, then you have a slight chance of making into the next block at 140 sat/byte

How about to TailsOS?  This project promotes open source privacy tools and makes it easy for users to keep their privacy online.
Why They Need Donations: 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:49:32
You could always load your wallet into Electrum, create a "Replace By Fee" transaction to raise the fee you paid.  This will ensure your transaction actually gets confirmed in a block, at the expense of the higher fee.
It will eventually get mined, fees havent been at 20 sat/byte in quite a while.  if you raise it to around 100, it will take a week or longer, but will more than likely get picked up
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:01:38
What Wallet are you using ?  Bring your seed or import a private key into electrum or core and make sure replace by fee is enabled. It should allow you to do so. If you are sending to a new wallet you control. You can try child pays for parent and send to another address you control.

TailsOS - Privacy for Everyone
Tails fits the cryptocurrency model of security, privacy, and anonymity on the internet in all transactions.  Keep it free and accessible to all by donating. 
Tails is free because nobody should have to pay to be safe while using computers.
But we need your support to stay alive!
Tails is an irreplaceable security tool as it allows anyone to use computers safely. But we know that secure tools need to be free software to be reliable and relevant in all situations. That's why we are giving out Tails for free.
If everybody using Tails today donated, our fundraising would be done for the whole year. But not everybody can donate. And that's fine. We just need some of you to give to keep on providing such a secure platform for everybody.
Donations from individuals, like you, are our most valuable funding as they make Tails more independent from government and corporate funding.
This year, please consider making a donation to protect and sustain Tails.

Gemini is my preffered exchange for these reasons:
1) Instant ACH Deposit.  You can deposit from a bank, and instantly trade with those coins.  Up to $500 a day
2) Lower Fees.  No deposit fee, trading fee only .25% and no withdrawal fee.
Things I would like to see improved:
1) Allow more ach deposits daily, maybe through better verification, up to 5k a day, 25k a month.  
2) Add more coins, Litecoin specifically.  its really what has kept me using coinbase for usd -&gt; ltc.
3) Implement SegWit.  If you can implement segwit it shows you are dedicated to improving BTC.
4) Support weekly/monthly buys.  This is a simple concept, and Coinbase has a lock on it in the USA.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:55:58
I agree.  Its not all on exchanges, but for everyday spending (most of the transactions coming from mobile wallets), there is not even 1 other option other than GreenAddress, and it is not great.  Most people dont want to pull out their hardware wallet or desktop wallet in order to pay for a $10-50 item.
Bread, where are we with SegWit support?
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:54:47
Same here, i am getting it with LiteCoin.  Gonna withdraw on coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:49:55
You mention Electrum has having a iOS app.  i do not believe this is true.  Should be modified for Android and Desktop only.

Once I removed all local data %user%/.hiddenwallet, and re-extracted the zip.  I restored the wallet, let it sync, and now we are rolling again.
Not sure what caused the error previously, but resetting all the settings help get us back on track.
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:13:33
Try this my friend:
It will convert bitpay stuff into a real address.  Just make sure to send the exact amount
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:21:35
I know they had to cancel all open orders on the BTC-USD book.
Check  twitter and such
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:25:49
Once someone can get a partnership with a liquidity pool and offer instant conversions from BTC to USD (similar to bitpay), I think more retailers will come on board.  Right now, no one wants to take BTC and hold BTC, other than a small minority of retailers.    Looking at BTCPay and OpenNode as potential options for USA Residents if they can solve this problem (Coingate does not operate in USA)
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:08:13
I would recommend getting on the LND Slack and asking there.  Lots of good help there.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:19:58
Same story, probably not same text.

It appears its missing Bgold, but otherwise its nice
@_date: 2019-12-30 15:34:56
Look at mynode. Installs core. Lnd. Electrum server. A block explorer and more
@_date: 2019-12-31 14:43:19
3 should be just fine.

Can you input a source and destination node ?  I can only find where you can use random source and destination.  Very cool visualizer.
EDIT:  What about inputting a value as well?  The paths would change depending on how much value you want to see the graph for.

I do not believe that you can see any transactional data (# of transactions, value of transactions, or transactions over a timeframe) unless it is routed through your node.  You can only see overall capacity of nodes and channels, as well as the channel's fee structure for relaying a payment.
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:30:16
Awesome.  Looking forward to the binaries, even though I jumped the gun a bit =)
For the power users, they could just compile from source
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:22:36
Just use gemini.  Instant buy with ACH.  Granted there are fees, but not nearly what Coinbase is.  They hold your coins from withdraw until the ACH clears

If you dont have the bandwidth or always on PC at home, here are some VPS providers for cheap that can help you run a node:
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:54:27
For the record, I would not recommend keeping any satoshis on the hosted VPS for security reasons.   I think people have different reasons to run a full node.  I personally want to support the ecosystem and learn more about the software without requiring a constantly on PC at my house.

Create a wallet on electrum on desktop.  Then get your master public key and you can use that on another machine as a watch only wallet to generate receive addresses and not allow spending from it.
I am sure there are mobile apps to help using the master public key on mobile to accept, but not authorized to spend.
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:04:17
Final is not out there, but they will show there when binaries are built

I was thinking about this the other day. Qr codes are nice, but building a standard around the NFC contactless payment system would be cool. Would only need to transmit the signed transaction and most mobile devices give developers access to the apis to develop. Biggest problem, the hardware to support it on the vendor side

Contact your Representative and let them know you support this.
Find your representative here:
Here is a sample form letter I just wrote:
Dear &lt;Representative's Name&gt;,
I am &lt;Insert Name&gt;, a &lt;Age&gt; year old living in &lt;Your Town, State&gt; in your District and I feel very strongly that the lack of guidance from Congress around the taxation of Crypto Currencies, such as Bitcoin, are stifling the innovation and impact they could have on society and our modern financial system.
Please join your fellow Congressmen David Schweikert of Arizona and Jared Polis of Colorado in supporting the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act.  It reduces the tax burden of small value transactions and would force congress to set guidelines of how capital gains should be treated for larger purchases.
If you would like to discuss Crypto Currencies, such as Bitcoin, and why I feel strongly that they are the future of finance, please contact me and I would be more than happy to give a crash course and answer any questions you may have.
Please find the text of the Act that was presented on September 7, 2017 here:  
I would also urge you to join your fellow Congressmen in the "Blockchain Caucus".  This group of Congressmen fight for the rights and liberties that Crytpo Currencies allow, while still enabling their users to have clearly defined regulation that does not hinder their growth.
&lt;Your Name&gt;
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:47:51
Do you have another Charity that takes Crypto that will help after these recent natural disasters ?
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:49:03
Gametime.  Thanks to all the devs who put their time and effort into building great software and constantly improving things that seem to work well.
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:39:34
Red Cross supports all people in need.  The money could very well go to those victims, or the earthquake victims in Mexico, any of the Caribbean Islands that were recently affected, or any future natural disaster that has yet to happen.
