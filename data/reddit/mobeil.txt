More than a xenophobic narcissist, yes. They just don't compare. But a racist country will elect a racist president I suppose. 
But thanks for proving my point.

Ah. :( was in a rush and it was the first google. 
Not sure of the reputation of this source (  here's an example:
"It only got worse from there. He proposed banning Muslims, an entire religious group, from entering the US. He argued that a federal judge overseeing the Trump University lawsuit should be disqualified because of his Mexican heritage. He regularly retweeted white supremacists and neo-Nazis. He frequently used anti-Semitic language. He called Elizabeth Warren, a sitting US senator, “Pocahontas.” He hinted at nationwide implementation of stop and frisk, a policing tactic that was deemed unconstitutional in New York City because it targeted minority residents."
And these examples go on and on. I'm very keen to hear how this isn't true though!

He did also call to ban Muslims from entering USA. But here's a quick article highlighting a couple of examples: 
I'm definitely open to information/evidence from Trump to suggest he isn't. I just haven't seen any, and him constantly repeating "I'm not racist. I'm the least racist person you know" doesn't really help!

All today proves is that racism trumps sexism. 
Edit: because you can't argue crazy with logic, I hope your post gets down voted to smithereens.

Well, funny thing..

What's wrong with that? If a good or service is traded in AUS then it should be paying a fair amount of tax?

All good, all good, 
"Penicillins are a certain collection of antibiotics that eliminate infection causing bacteria. "
Wait, there's more:
"Also known in short as pen or PCN, they originate from a type of fungi called Penicillium fungi. They are used in the treatment or prevention of many different bacterial infections, usually caused by Gram-positive organisms."
So Ahh, tasty penicillin?..

Sorry I had to be the one to break the news :(
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:19:41
Do you like Penicillin?

Oic - thanks for the FYI :)

They're humiliated because of their own spending - they surely can't expect to have it best both ways?

Tell that to our prime minister..

It's more that once a backdoor is built, it then gives hackers an entrance in.
