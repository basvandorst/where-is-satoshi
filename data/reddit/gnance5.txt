$600 made. If you made over $600 you are supposed to report it and pay taxes on the money you made. Not your initial investment. That was money you already had. I’m not sure if the exchanges will report your profits if over $600. They don’t even bother under $600, it’s not required. No one is.

Less than $600.00 you don’t need to report it.

It is just my opinion. I’ve only ever owned bitcoin to buy other coins. Now I use Ethereum. Me personally, I avoid bitcoin. Am I right or am I wrong in avoiding it? Ethereum is cheaper to use and faster in MY experiences. Don’t get me wrong, I am a major long term holder of my investments. Even though the market is not doing good price wise, I have many altcoins that are technically spectacular and I feel will be successful or else I would have jumped ship a while back. Good days and bad days. These bad days, they too will pass. I hope.

This whole crypto currency saga WAS just a passing fad to make some people wealthy. I’m losing faith every week.
