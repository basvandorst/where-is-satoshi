Ok its a bit funny but it would be boring with only 1 coin. As much as i love BTC i like other experimentation as well. But year 90% of them are shit.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:45:24
I'm in it for i hate banks and refuse to save my "money" with the gangsters. They ask me what i want to do with my money when i take out "too much". Hell i have to fill in a blanket for taking out or in money after some silly small amount. Even a iPhone cost more these days then that. So no i dont want lambos. 
Also i think mining might go away in future. We might consider another consensus method. God forbid of PoS or something proofs to be a good solution. Smart people will find new ways i'm sure.  For now the network is safe and has room to grow.

What i understand is that we are at v0.15.1 and moving into 0.16 and later 0.17 which are both major releases or what is it i'm missing? Either of these 2 version from what i see is substantial in term of scaling issue. I'm not that great at reading the github so maybe i'm missing something. Tried to check previous comment a little but cant find much either. Anyway i'm really looking forward to LN, BTC is really bad as it is now. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:49:20
Thank you will read the article tomorrow, I have read about LN and offchain channels but can always lean more. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:19:09
And what is exactly in this "new" version? 
If its the 3 items from below than its really bad for a major release! What about LN and scaling solution?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:46:22
Just go to the tools menu and select blockchain and open your segwith wallet. From there you get segwit address. Send your funds there. Thats all.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:29:18
LOL mine does the same :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:42:15
Its all great and all but be sure you won't be doing any trade any time soon. LTC/ETH goes fast but BTC takes 1-3 hour depending on network load. I have had bad luck a few time with up to 12 hour. 
Thats the only thing i don't like with BTC. Huge confirmation times. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:39:24
All of that sounds great! One thing i don't understand is how is the LN utilised, i mean do we get a simple interface to do the exchange?
If i understand it there has to be a counterpart for the LN and exchange to take place. Also it won't help with the fee when it comes to sending to lets say Coinbase (when you want to go to fiat).
Segwit should reduce the fee once Coinbase implement it i hope. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:58:24
Google/Apple/Amazon/Mobile/TV/the Internet ...........
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:44:22
You get to select if you want your wallet to be legacy or segwit. Just select segwit. Thats the updated address format. You can receive BTC from both legacy and segwit. With segwit fees should be lower.

Gratz. I'm holding my 1 BTC on a pretty Ledger :)
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:10:08
Waoo Mark is my new hero. He told them the truth and they shutup with followup questions. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:48:44
Can you elaborate on that? In what regard and how?
Also my question is more about the BTC and the near future changes. I know the block size has increased on BCC but that is it. Or is BCC also going to add another update? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:19:03
Very good read, now I understand what segwit2x is and the background. Thanks for the link! 
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:35:14
Hehe nope, it feels crazy, never seen it rise like this, I started again buying at 2700 which I thought was crazy high but looking back I should have gotten more �� 
I'm sure a hard crash in imminent but now we are making new ATH which is a good indicator we will get back there again after the dip.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:54:33
Thanks allot, let me read more on it....
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:52:46
Hehe me too, now I'm buying more ETH in the hope that I can swap later. Hopefully ETH rises even if we see a dip in BTC. I want more of precious hehe
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:49:50
I thought the consensus was to go 2x actually but maybe I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:21:27
I hope we get to be to with our much smaller shares. I started very early but wasn't smart enough to hodle.
I had the chance again when ETH was 10$ but got to few (hate myself).
This time I got more NEO so I hope I get to the moon �� this time . Still will hodle my BTC if it rise to the crazy amount people talk about. I mean there are only 21 miljon and trillions of people so just HODL ��
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:30:52
Ok 7.5 billion to be exact :) , even if one third comes onboard = Saturnus hehe
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:57:39
This sounds really scary. Can't end well if they don't come to a consensus fast. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:32:09
Thanks for info. I guess that is true. Still with bitcoin gold of they remove support for ASIC it might be a bit better. It might not be as profitable as today for these companies to mine. 
O well I just hope we don't destroy bitcoin thanks to all these forks and internal fighting.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:19:39
Yes i read about that, they will have a much faster hardware 7nm if remember. 
Still None of that answer my questions or the whole dilemma around mining. I like to understand what is the consequence if miners stopped mining in China and we only had to rely on say Genesis (Ireland mostly) and people around the work who might pick up the slack if difficulty goes way way down? 
I can guess the transaction would be slower maybe at first and maybe higher fee. Or?
@_date: 2019-09-07 14:49:43
Now imagine even more noob people wanting to enter bitcoin. There has to be much much simpler wallets for people to use + better addresses.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:38:22
I'm noob at the technical part of things but in reality tired of the manipulation and the whole miner business and the dependency on them. To be honest I like what bitcoin gold is going to add, that being ASIC resistant. Much like vertcoin. 
Here is what my knowledge lack but what would be the consequence of the bitcoin went this route? Meaning bitcoin = bitcoin gold
We get rid is mining nonsense and China dependency on my simple thinking. I'm sure you guys will bring up many other problems with that but is it not better to get back our freedom from these big corps who try to disrupt bitcoin for their gain?
Sorry if I'm saying things that are maybe stupid even but I'm guessing many people like myself are thinking in this way as well. Not everyone are hardcore. From outside the idea being ASIC resistant is appealing.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:19:44
You can get bitpay card. Uses visa for withdrawal. Easy.
And this picture being old smells like someone wants a pump.
@_date: 2019-09-07 14:52:25
Exactly, unless 1 Sat gets much much higher value so that 1 BTC is worth 1 million dollar :D
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:11:41
So the question will be which one will  dominate. ETC don't seem to take off compared to ETH. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:43:07
Agree i have the same feeling, a big deep like what we saw 17th of June before we go back up again. Or atleast i'm hoping for one :D
I'm all invested in alt coin now and don't wanna bother with back and forth but if it deeps i might get 1 BTC :D no cash left hehe
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:15:22
cool, i think this is what new people will imagine it to be for real :D
@_date: 2018-12-29 19:50:20
You dont need to wait more then maybe 5-10min for taking out your coins from Coinbase. I dont understand your problem really?
I also recommend Bitstamp, reliable and good service. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:18:37
Thats what i was expecting, then it might have been your bank that delayed the purchase. If coinbase get the fund they give you the coin right away. It has happened to me once and it was my bank that caused the headache. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:29:26
Cant say i was impressed, very very slow for trading! Took a day to get my coin out of there. They do things manually and dont even bother to transfer during holidays so be prepared for that! 
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:23:39
Thanks might try them next time :)
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:11:13
Great idea! I already use ledger but its a good idea if the majority of people learn how to receive their coins on hardware wallet or even computer wallet like Exodus.
We will for sure expose scam exchanges and also learn a thing or two. Always own your key or its not your coin. Thats why we dont another centralized "bankster" node that are acting as exchanges now. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:45:18
Waiting for that myself, there has to be more panic coming our way before it takes off, but then again maybe now at this moment around 2037 is the lowest, this market is soooo damn hard to read. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 19:49:06
Coinbase is a good option if you want to buy with FIAT. I trust them much more then most other alternative out there. 
Also Bitstamp is a good option. Atleast in EU these are the only 2 option i would recommend if you want to send money to. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 07:49:27
Game over for 99% of shitcoins once more wallet use this. 
I still love privacy coins but man BTC is killing other shitcoins left and right.
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:07:30
I dont think it was the coin that was the issue but your bank! 
Did you have the money already with Coinbase when you purchased? (also buy from the pro.coinbase for avoiding fees).
I buy regularly and never waited anything then a few second before i see the coin on my balance IF the purchase it approved by the bank or if i already have money on my account that is.
