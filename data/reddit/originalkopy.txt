Even if you lose your hardware wallet, almost of them support a recovery seed. Which is a random collection of words that you can enter to recover whatever was on your wallet. This is much safer than an online wallet. Once it's gone, it's gone.

Not a single argument? I guess if you want the same exact car with much less space then get the cx-3 lol. I lug around alot of gear for outdoor sports and going up to Tahoe in the winter. The AWD is amazing and can carry 5 people comfortably. Cx-3 is just a smaller version of it.

May I ask why US equities are good too buy because of the new tax reform?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:49:30
No one mentioned the 2 or 3 though?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:04:50
I have the cx-5, suv, and after doing all the research, it's definitely the way to go.

Has anyone been able to send their coins off of coinbase? 9 hours later, still waiting for them to hit my wallet. Good luck out there boys.

Something or nothing will happen, I guarantee it.

Wouldn't it be great if we talked less about the price and more about scaling and the issues that our current implementation has and how we can all work together to ensure we actually do get to that 1mil per coin that we keep dreaming of?

How is it regulated in the US?

That doesn't make much sense. The highest rent in the Bay Area is in San Francisco. It would be much cheaper to live near Cupertino (maybe not in it but a town nearby) and commute from there. It wouldn't make sense for Apple employees to live in expensive SF to escape expensive Cupertino.

I think the question is worded fine just because it mentions digital currency. Paypal does not use a digital currency, it uses $ which is Fiat.

Hey guys, just bought my first bitcoin after the china crash and been a lurker ever since. One of my favorite online tee stores just started accepting bitcoins as payment. When you use bitcoin, you apparently get a free hat. The image I linked is the announcement I just recieved through their email list. Get a free bitcoin hat and buy a cool shirt from their site. :D
ps im in no way affiliated with 6dollarshirts.com, just a fan of their stuff
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:17:22
please explain how losing all your bitcoins in a single click is any different than eBanking or eTrading where you can also lose all your money in a single click? yes you're right, one dumb click can cause you to lose all your money but this isn't specific to bitcoin... in the slightest. also... there is a trace, you can see every transaction that has ever happened so you know if/when a transaction has occurred. are you sure you know enough to be making these kinds of speculations?
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:52:44
And you're fully verified?

A bug in the protocol, or any flaw in bitcoins design. He means an internal problem like that. No outside factor other than a flaw in the technology will cause him (or I) to give up on bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:19:56
I have 2-step authentication on my coinbase account but what if your phone gets lost or stolen? Could this potentially be another security risk? What is the best way to avoid losing access to your bitcoins if you lose the ability to 2-step auth it? Do you even see this being a problem? I know there are ways to get around the phone authy (google auth and backup phones) but what if you have neither. Sorry for so many questions, just wanted to hear your guy's take on this. thanks
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:50:33
That's exactly what this sounds like, an elaborate plot that could only be better retold with Michael Bay and some 'splosions. It's an interesting set of theories but very far fetched IMO.
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:54:41
I don't think it's actually regulated in the sense other currencies are, can u provide some proof?
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:13:51
Sounds possible but this is still just conjecture. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:20:54
You're probably not verified. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 01:58:39
Bitcoin and it's exchanges are still very very young in their life stages. Not everything that is released is perfect right away. Bitcoin is still in beta after all. Only time, intelligence and heavy scrutiny by the bitcoin community will fix these problems as the technology matures. Sorry that you lost some coins to due speed bumps in bitcoin's early stages, nothing is perfect, but it will get better and it has. Sorry to use a cliche but Rome wasn't built in a day, you can't expect Bitcoin and it's dependent organizations to be either.   
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:10:41
Greed fosters stupidity as well as innovation, Bitcoin has seen its fair share of both that's for sure.
@_date: 2014-01-29 01:43:22
I posted this here, the day you guys sent out that email informing your subscribers.
thanks again!
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:57:52
Yea sorry about that, didn't see all the other comments that had already said what I wanted to say until after I submitted. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 22:28:48
I'm sorry but I have to disagree, just as people should not b betting their life savings on bitcoin by buying into it, you should not be basing your future on it either. Remember the whole thing could crash tmr. There are no gaurantees in this technology... having a degree is 100% safe and doesn't have the possibility of being worth noting in a year. Do yourself a favor and go back to school. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:54:47
I was wondering the same thing. I would assume since they just added the support they haven't updated the info in their sidebars yet. I sent an email to their info address to ask em about it. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:29:59
What would be their motivation for that?
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:50:55
I'm starting to think that Mt. Gox had a much bigger impact on the overall market price than we thought. The deliberate arbitrage, price inflation and high volume trading there might have been (somewhat of) a reason for it staying so high for so long. What do you think?
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:46:50
thanks for info, definitely puts me at ease with holding my bitcoins at coinbase.
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:45:35
you probably just shouldn't use the internet at all if you're going to be that paranoid about it. lots of the applications and websites you use today were built off of the data that those services collected over the years. you can't have your cake (complete anonymity) and eat it too (free web based services). take off your aluminum foil hat buddy.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:45:33
Damn, how did I not know this earlier... so even in an eCommerce site where checkout is done in https but the browsing shopping is just http, an intruder can disable the SSL and takeover their session? Thanks for the info man.

Why would this cause a crash?
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:59:07
I don't think you can compare the blockchain to an exchange. One is a ledger of the history of every bitcoin transaction, another is a process by which you actively try to match up buyers and sellers as quickly as possible to complete a transaction. One deals in recording and keeping track of data, while the other deals in real time moving of currency (whether it be crypto or fiat). Exchanges aren't part of the Bitcoin technology, it's a service, whereas the ledger is an inherent piece of Bitcoin.

You sound like a really nice guy and everything but putting yourself second isn't actually helping whoever you're putting first that much... The number one investment you should be and need to be making is on yourself. You owe it to yourself and need to be selfish and figure out your own life/financials before you can really help anyone. Stop using the excuse that you put yourself second as a reason for not achieving your goals and living up to your full potential. You only live life once, live it for yourself first and whoever you choose to spend it with will only benefit from it. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:14:06
Having an entrepreneurial spirit sounds great and everything but unfortunately for a young engineer graduating or just having graduated college, the opportunities available to you (career and money wise) are much much MUCH greater than trying to stumble your way through growing a start up. As a computer engineering student I created a neat product for smart home automation (think nest combined with an xbox kinect so you could control your house appliances/functions via body gestures). Could I have built a start-up out of my product, absolutely. but the offers I was getting to work for companies and the paychecks that came with them were too high to say no to, especially with student loans to pay off. Just trying to give a first hand experience with the options that "typical engineers" have these days and why most of them aren't pursuing interesting and entrepreneurial ventures rather than taking a fat salary with job security. The juice has to be worth the squeeze and it just isn't 90% of the time. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:15:20
Not to my understanding, no. Someone needs to be the middle man between the buyer and seller or you'll have chaos. How else would a buyer and seller be matched up? An exchange facilitates that transaction.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:56:38
Valid point. It would be a quite the double entendre if the real satoshi were to sign something saying he was not Dorian. Not only would Leah and Newsweek be eating their words but the world will know that the true mastermind is still out there. Damn I feel like I'm living in a movie!!! Love this shit.
@_date: 2014-01-09 01:28:21
Right, their view of the world is very finite especially as their life's end is on the horizon. No appreciation for the continuity and progress of technology leads to inherent subconscious reluctance to the idea of change. Not meant to be a blanket statement for all old people but I can understand this explanation for why the elderly are against technologies like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:22:30
Right, I never said my faith has wavered, I believe in it whole heartedly. But the price seems to be easily manipulated in these early stages, something history will highlight I'm sure.
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:17:57
y did you do that? a year and a half is nothing, you won't be missing anything in that time and that degree you will have the rest of your life. when ppl tell me they are considering routes like this i highly discourage it. its the entrepreneurial equivalent of skipping college to go play for the NBA, you could suck in a couple years or get hurt... and where would you be then? get your degree yo
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:32:49
Those scenarios aren't something I would realistically consider in my idea for the future of bitcoin. Its a technology by the community for the community, that's the notion I have faith in. If you live your life expecting the worse to happen then you won't take any risks and a life without risks is not a life that sounds appealing to me. It may be bit of a naive notion but at least I believe in something. Also im not an idiot, I don't have my entire lIfe savings in bitcoin. I hold enough that if it were all to be gone tomorrow I'd still be more than ok financially. So yes my commitment to bitcoin truly does run that deep but I'm not blinded by it by any means.
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:01:38
Agreed, obviously they won't b the highest quality shirts but they're fun to wear for six months or so before they fade out or stretch out. And a tip for everyone, get on their mailing list and check the tee time shirts they promote daily. Along w the code that comes with the saying promotional email you can get free shipping so the shirt really is only $6. That's how I buy most of my shirts. Happy bitcoining :)

some friendly advice about a product i supported on kickstarter, grab an orbit key to keep your keys more organized, i got mine a month ago and it's been pretty handy in stopping that key jangle... unless you're into that kinda thing :P
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:21:48
This is pretty tinfoil hat but I want it to be true so bad, it would make the crazy plot twist that's already unraveling into something out of a mission impossible:7 movie... gawd damn

I'm in the same boat as you, can't stop hitting refresh and reading what people are digging up on this. I'm getting chills just thinking how mind-boggling this is. Fucking. Mark. The. Magic. Guy.
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:31:42
Ah, then its your bank or credit card institution that is flagging the withdrawal and preventing coinbase from pulling your funds. Try to contact your bank and see what's up. Who do you use?
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:09:40
How and what are you mining on if you don't mind me asking
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:37:21
Ah got it. Do you know what, if any, plan there is that the Bitcoin community has started talking about in the case that quantum computing does come about sooner than expected? Won't quantum computing make Bitcoin unsecure since anyone could brute force the private keys?

@_date: 2017-11-25 18:50:45
Why would it need a fork? Wouldn't it just be more like a patch, or an update to the core functionality? Someone correct me if I'm wrong but generally a fork implies development and use will move in two separate directions.
