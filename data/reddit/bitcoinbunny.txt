There are different methodologies for getting what you want. Don't make it sound like your way is the only way. That's just arrogant, condescending, ignorant, and dumb.

Well, if you're so successful in proving your point, you wouldn't have withdrawn onto the deep abscesses of the internet. I take my advice from those who win in real life. Unfortunately for you, there are many nuances to winning over people. Niceties and ass kissing doesn't always get you there.

go fuck yourself. They should have shut down deposits but they kept them open despite finding out they didn't have the coins.

It's amusing that some of those who espouse bitcoins, which is fundamentally about deregulation, are those that enforce and promote censorship. Then again the opportunity to gain an iota of power such as in a "highly coveted subreddit moderator" position will attract the lowest common denominator of men.

if you know the blogger, how did he find this leaked document? If it's real, I suspect it was deliberately leaked. Did/does he have close ties to Mt. Gox?

Oh i never implied anarchism, I implied fascism. One means no regulation, the other means a lot of censorship. Dumbass.
