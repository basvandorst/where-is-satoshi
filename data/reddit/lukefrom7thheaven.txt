Did you come here to vehemently defend a gold stock, or to give some semblance of credible advice.
Exit Bitcoin before your Windows computer gets hacked.

seriously? this press release said nothing at all. It's a political non-statement.
Fuck politics, and fuck the Bitcoin Foundation.

It seems like, deep down, you're only into Bitcoin to "get rich" in the eyes of your peers, but you can't make up your mind. The whole OP was essentially a bitch post about how one of your coworkers is rich and therefore you feel like less of a man. So let's add -1 to your suitability for Bitcoin given that your intentions are in the wrong place.
Libertarian ideals may appeal to you, but at the end of the day you don't give a fuck about freedom or what global issues Bitcoin could solve. You're only here to make money, you were always here to make money, and you didn't even make much money. Now your stupid coworker is shoving it in your face, and you're jumping right through the hoop as if your sole goal was to profit from Bitcoin all along, but you failed at it. Or failed to realize it because you were confused.
Are you long on Bitcoin? Are you just using Bitcoin to buy shit you don't want on your CC? Are you hating yourself because you bought stuff for BTC when you could've hoarded coins, like your friend did? It's not really clear what you're up to, but it is clear that you feel like a failure given that you didn't turn into a millionaire overnight.
I don't know what to tell you. The biggest risk to Bitcoin is a government war-on-freedom style shutdown. MtGox is about to be supplanted by a throng of utterly pissed off, infinitely higher performance competing exchanges, so the lawsuit means nothing. It appears BTC has been tanking lately due to possible insider trading from fucking Peter V's alpha CoinLab investors, who have likely been dumping a large amount of coins this past week. The price drop over the last couple days really didn't make much sense, but in retrospect, now it's looking like some asshole investors knew about the lawsuit beforehand. This, and the single most damaging string of DDoS attacks by price manipulators in the history of Bitcoin, have tanked the price and scared a lot of people out of the markets. It sure has scared the piss out of you, OP.
Judging by your comments, there's probably still quite a few straggler early adopters, or lucky investors, who now just want to GTFO of the market because the swings are too intense. Thanks for the information. The price will probably bounce around the $75-$150 range in the coming days. The tree needs to be violently shaken to force out all of the weak hands (like yours). After that, the sky's the limit.
That, or Big Brother crushes everything and we all go into internment camps for reeducation.

Bitcoin will either be a fringe currency or an infrastructural currency, not unlike Linux. Bitcoin payments will always be faster, cheaper and more secure than traditional means of payment, which means there's a compelling business reason to see it better integrated into existing systems. For instance, with Bridgewalker, USD payments are converted into BTC, which is then transferred from Person A to Person B, and then converted back to USD. This can be faster and cheaper than had Person A wired USD to Person B; it's also more secure than cash, since cash can be counterfeited.
It would be liberating if Bitcoin were outright banned, because then it would be clear to everyone that there are some sick, twisted motherfuckers running this planet who'd rather stomp out human progress than liberate people.

I don't see the appeal to these stacks of paper. Physical bills could really attract negative attention from the authorities, because it is illegal to circulate money that appears similar to fiat (paper) currency. Yeah, Bitcoin is different, but tell that to the boot stomping on your face for eternity.
Fascist legal ramifications aside, I wouldn't ever accept paper bills like these anyway. I doubt I'd even accept casacius coins, because there's just no way of knowing if the private key has been compromised at any point in time with any of this shit.
