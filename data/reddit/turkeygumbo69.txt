There’s even one like this that has your password in the subject line, check your junk folder in your email. You probably have one too.
One of them threatens that they have recorded you through your webcam masturbating and threaten to send it to all your friends and family.
Change your passwords people!!!

Yeah, you refer to the system you used to pay...that’s kinda how it works. Can I pay with card? Cash? Bitcoin? The end. 
“Pay with dollars and cents?” Sounds kinda dumb to me when you can just say “cash”.
“I paid him in bitcoin” and “I paid with Bitcoin” both technically work.
Regardless, it isn’t even plural because he didn’t even spend an entire bitcoin, much less multiple....you must be really stupid.

Why would you use something like that when there are cards that convert to crypto upon order/swipe? That’s like me tracking down a landline to make a phone call...or writing this message to you via note in a bottle.

It’s not even a full bitcoin ��.  “You don’t say can I pay in dollar or dollars”. Unless you’re from another planet perhaps.
“I paid with cash”
“I paid with bitcoin”
“I paid with yen”
Pesos works, Rupees works...bitcoins does not.
The proper way to say that is “I paid with Bitcoin”.
Just bugs me because then more people start saying it incorrectly and before you know it, all of us bag holders look just as stupid.

Bitcoins, as in plural? Can I pay with “cashes” instead?

The objective is to always shorten the code or refactor it. This is supposed to be concerning?
