Is there any hope of getting it out at this point? Similar situation, ~8.6 bitcoins kept captive by Mt. Gox

Alright, I'll pray it goes through quickly!
One final question- how can I do Proof Of Residency as a minor living at home?
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:29:04
Oh well, I'm not a verified Gox user, or at least I don't believe I am. How does it work, anyways? Like what is this guy going to be able to do with Gox bitcoin?

I'll try to avoid panicking. I'm going to keep checking this subreddit to look for news of them opening up withdrawals, is there anything else I can do?

I have 8.6 Bitcoins stuck in Mt. Gox. I was 15 or 16 when I bought them for $13 each several years ago, I just wish I had been wise enough to withdrawal them when I had a chance :/

I really appreciate your reply, it is so much more helpful than the "lol ur screwed" replies that I got previously! 
I'm going through verification right now- Is it safe to give them their drivers license? I feel somewhat sketchy giving them my personal information like that.

alright, I'll keep an ear to the ground!

I have coins in Mt. Gox. I have been meaning to put them in a more secure wallet like an offline one, do I still have a chance of doing that?
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:48:45
All ~8.61btc that I owned were in mt. gox. Fucking sucks, knowing that I could have prevented it just by withdrawing earlier.

Damn, well I'll talk to my parents. I might be able to wait for my tax return, but that will be in a few months. Shame I can't use the one from last year. Thanks so much for your help, I feel like I'm not completely screwed now!

I'm in the same situation. 17 (invested at 15 or 16) and lost ~8.61 btc.
Learn from this, and don't beat yourself up over the money (it can be earned again over time) but rather not withdrawing it to a local wallet before it was too late.

I have 8.6BTC that I bought at $13 each. It was tempting to cash out when it was worth 2k, but I am in it for a long term investment.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:23:55
Same here. Luckily I threw $100 in when it was at 13 USD to 1 BTC, but boy do I regret not investing when it was at $3-4!
