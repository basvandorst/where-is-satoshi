this is actually pretty normal for bitcoin. this is how it works. it usually gets confirmed eventually. if you are in a hurry, send a larger fee. i am trying to save lately by using smallest fees possible, still nothing lasts more than 10-30 min on average to be confirmed.

try mining some cpu only altcoins. like kriptonyte or x11

i completely forgot about it, and got surprised when i got sms from bitstamp, saying that i set myself an sms alarm for when the price goes under 500€.

I was reading last few chapters with teary eyes, yet cant help myself to remind you, that we are not the only ones you are working for. Never forget about your family!

spoon or fork?

this XT thing, lets say i dont like it and i started running an extra nonXT node. Will it matter at all if i dont own some 26% of network mining hashrate?

i think my first choice would be mycellium. Coinbase is a company that holds your bitcoins, that is why i dont even want to know much about how it works. but i read it is easy to acquire coins there with a CC or similar.

As i understand, you must have used a middlemen between coinbase and paypal, and that middleman is the one that screwed you. there are many scam offers lately promising 10% more value out of thin air, which should be a warning by itself. If you fell for this one, then i'm sorry you lost your coins to a scam.

Have you heard "black MIDI"? i find it very comparable to spam filled blocks. 
If there is a plan to sort that out, give me a donation address!!

blockchain wallet is a pain in the ass. you need to carefully make a manual TX with fee that you believe should push the TX through.

Three blocks found in less than a minute (according to timestamps). How does that happen?
@_date: 2016-09-27 08:12:10
well i just use my s7 to blow into the heat pump that heats the whole house with sanitary and radiator heat. i can say that i am recycling the heat from the miner, but who knows with what kind of pathetic efficiency

another product i do like to use is the BitStamp app. it is essentially an exchange app, but it also works as a 0 fee wallet. and since it is an exchange, noone should keep too much funds there.

Transfer them to address you control and HODL!

at 1MB blocks, its rougly 52GB/year (minus negligable percent of empty/not full blocks). do the math if the blocksize increases 1x/2x/4x/8x/Nx

you have the money on the address you wrote down with pencil. If the wallet address changed, it means that blockchain wallet created a new address for your privacy. 
It is a pain in the butt to use blockchain wallet, but try again and you will find the money you missed. after all, the school is worth 80 bucks right? ;)

thank you!

maybe few miners need to pay some bills and pre-halving stash just ran out.
@_date: 2016-09-13 08:37:30
yes and im sorry i cant help. im just figuring out how paypal would accept bitcoins but since im not using coinbase i thought this was "just another walet" but i guess it is much more than that if it allows you to transfer value to paypal. i'm sorry i cannot help you further.

yeah right. 100%/week? STAY AWAY!!!

When it was my first time using 'simple' online banking to pay the bills it was also a bit frustrating at first. But even my mum was doing that before me, and she quickly learnt something new out of necessity. Same thing would happen to Bitcoin. When majority realizes its potential, they will adapt, even if it looks complicated at first. And if someone asks you how it works, i believe best thing is to just forward them to  !

chinese voted for 8 then as the only alternative to 20.
Be your own bank starts to loose its sound when one cannot run a full node anymore on now ok, but soon obsolete hardware.

mostly dont fall for scams that promise you that kind of money for free, or just to install their super new awesome virus/trojan to steal all your private keys and login passwords...
@_date: 2015-09-03 20:36:18
coin flapper and coin hopper. not sure if they are available for iPhone though, android works.
@_date: 2015-09-14 20:57:37
if there is a chance of that, there will never be 21m bitcoins!

Whats up with theese scams lately, growing like mushrooms...

is this something like OneCoin? :P

i have seen an article in newspaper about bitcoin, half of page, last tuesday. that might explain Slovenia on 2nd place?
@_date: 2015-10-17 10:37:10
What if...
...bitcoin is the AI we are expecting by the end of 2016? As some scientists might suggest this assasination scenario would be best survivability option for the self concsious, probably intelligent by design beings, wouldnt it? In attemt to aquire capital to evolve faster and faster. Eventually pay humans "in bitcoin" to help it reach it's goals?
It might already "own" all the Satoshi's coins!
It might already be causing another economic "panic" all over the globe.
What if...

You got the point. You may find obstacles on your journey, but dont be afraid, FAQs and google are your friends.
And a hint, currently i believe you can get most of your electricity by mining ethereum (with a GPU). But that might change soon, as the difficulty and hashrate are skyrocketing lately. Do your daily research.
@_date: 2016-07-17 17:13:08
my thoughts as an enthusiast (wouldnt say experienced enough):
learn what mining is all about, how it works as deep as you can grasp it, learn about different algorithms and which can be profitable. 
I would only use minergate as a testing ground, to see quite quickly what kind of hashrate some hardware can produce, than i would learn more about most exciting algoritm and coin and go mine it directly with a help of a pool with that specific algo.
and while you can make BTC with cpu or gpu mining, it only means you are selling your hashrate to miners who understand how to use it. they actually pay you in BTC, while they mine their favourite coin. it is not worth hashing SHA265 (the bitcoin algorithm) with CPU or GPU though, you need special hardware (ASICs) that can do many many more hashes than many million(!) CPUs combined.

Btmaintech introduces QuantumASIC. instantly mines all the remaining bitcoins. Security becomes obsolete. Money becomes obsolete.
