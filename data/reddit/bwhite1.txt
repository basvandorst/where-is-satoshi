I got a random PM from some one in regards to holding onto BTC for me. They said in the message "I saw that you posted about owning bitcoin"... It was a post from 2 years ago, the message came in last week.

Your list of hardware wallets says only the ledger nano S, I can confirm that the Blue has it aswell.

Only time I’ve ever dowbvoted this phrase...

I've started using mine whenever I can and replenishing when I can. I don't spend as much money as i make and I've been fortunate with the swings so far.

Perspective is everything. Let me guess you're a 12/17 BTCbaby?
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:19:41
What does this all mean? Bitcoin is very confusing to me and I'm trying to understand how it all works better.
I didn't realize until a friend told me that moving bitcoin between wallets requires a miner to approve it. What does it mean in that one miner / operation got this block and why is it 'shitcoin'?
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:56:30
So how will I go about accessing the new coin?
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:14:19
Will do, thank you for the reply!
@_date: 2019-03-12 20:25:05
Shove 'em up your ass because you've already fucked yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:59:53
Good. You're not making the first mistake most people make. You're not buying btc with money you can't afford to lose.
Most people jump in and lose money because in 3 weeks they need that money back
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:48:47
Where can I read up on this?
@_date: 2019-10-08 21:31:38
Came to say this... lmao. 
You can 100% make a fake bitcoin.

BCH? goes flying from the bucket.
It's too bright compared to the smoke. Eye immediately picked up that something was thrown out.

It’s all about proper venting and a little bit of sound proofing (insulation works too)

To be quite honest I spent less than 1 minute looking it up before sending that :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:54:45
people say btc is worth 3x gold....
if it was really worth 3x gold btc would be worth 1.5 million usd per btc.
Just wait for the day that BTC market cap is the same as gold (hoping for 5 yrs) and then you'll be good.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:41:22
No. Yes. Maybe. 
Why wouldn’t you want to spend more to make a transaction?
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:42:01
Awesome! Thanks Yoda!
Part of the post for me was venting frustration for the operational methods of coinbase. The customer support taking months+, fees even when it's stated that there aren't any. It's still a recommended platform on the sidebar is another thing, I don't know if this means that this is SOP for exchanges or if this is an outlier.

Even when you're buying / selling between their wallet there is still a 1.4% fee. At first I thought it was a transaction fee from the miners, but that is significantly lower than 1.4% 
When I sold a bitcoin today selling it to my coinbase wallet cost 25$ and maybe a penny or two, selling it to my bank account had the same value. So they say they don't charge a fee if you use funds that you keep with them, but they charge you the same 1.4% that they do for a bank transfer.

Fuck man I tried to upvote you twice and it won't fucking let me!

Yes. Suck all the dick you can.

No it doesn't. You can lead them to water but you can't make them drink.
