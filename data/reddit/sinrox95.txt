Ah, I see. Wow. Sounds good. I won’t have any issues purchasing from Singapore ?

May I please check if I can perform the transaction despite being someone from Singapore ?

Firstly, thank you very much for your reply and the suggestion.
I checked Coinhako before. It uses Xfers.io (almost no fees required) to deposit $$ for the purchase of BTC/ETH. I was able to increase it's daily limit to only $20k but unfortunately they are having a major upgrade and hence am unable to deposit any $$ till 11th Dec :(
Do you mind if I ask what's your daily/weekly limit for Coinbase ? I had just started 2 weeks ago with Coinbase and their limit has yet to increase despite all the verification. Currently on a mere $3k weekly limit via Xfers.io and only $100 daily limit via credit/debit card :((
Will it increase over time as I use Coinbase ? Do I have to max out their limits every day/week to increase the limits ?
edit: I just realise I asked way too much omg. My sincerest apologies for that.

this is the transaction ID. Oh btw, thank you so much for your assistance :)

The deposit limits are way too low unfortunately and it’s gonna take ages... :(

There are way too little sellers in my area and there’s not enough coins there.

If the queue gets longer and longer, will that mean I will not get my BTC transferred for the rest of my life ?

Singaporeans unite !!!!! I've yet to try. How about you ?

Hi, when I checked the transaction ID via the link sent, nothing appeared but when I checked on Blockchain.info I can see the transaction. Does this mean anything ? (not being able to see on yr platform)
