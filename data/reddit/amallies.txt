Yes. Well it's a multitude of actions as you say. Part of the strategy is physical, and the other is psychological (because people buy and sell on emotion, charting patterns, and news etc.). 
A number of strategies culminate together to push the price one way or another with two goals in mind:
**1)** to make profit
**2)** deflate confidence in Crypto, as a direct competitor to a largely unchallenged monopoly on fiat-money issuance by central banks (like the US Fed for over 100 years).

Success is literally hypocrisy though. For every winner there has to be a loser. Everytime the lion gets a kill to survive, the gazelle has to die.

Anybody notice the guest speaker's almost canned and predictable scepticism?  It aligns very closely with the anti-coin narrative set up by the media industry.
He's the kind of guy that reads a heading on a news website and then emulate's the same mindset without thinking past that *first layer of information*.
**THE MEDIA**
**1)** The Media is Centralized:
**2)** The Centralized Media is anti-crypto:
**3)** The Centralized Media is well coordinated:

Wow a person with an actual audience spoke positively about Bitcoin and this random anon on Reddit has the audacity to take a swipe.

**Here's some background:**

Yeh, so it's basically a scam. If you're not able to withdraw tokens then you're not really buying crypto. You're just pretending to.  
You're in essence, buying something more akin to a derivative i.e. 'derived from the underlying *real* asset'.
Which is why we should not be encouraging use of Robinhood where possible, and should instead herd people towards buying real BTC tokens on other platforms and withdrawing them to their own wallets to take supply off the market.

No they also pumped the market, a lot of that money was their money. They pumped it and got a lot of greater fools to rush in, then initiated the catalyst for price reversal.
So they made money. That's how whales operate. You use the huge pools of capital at your disposal to influence the price in the direction you want it to, up or down there is money to be made.

They absolutely do.

It was much "smarter" before the 2017 pump when we used to talk constructively about building our future rather than whinge and moan about prices.
Too many people who bought at the ATH (i.e. dumb money)

Doesn't mean we won't win these games. The banks need to gtfo.

Still a scam to me. I don't agree with their practices. Think bigger picture please.
It's like me opening a cake shop where you buy and hold paper cake tokens instead of cake.

Exactly. It's like me opening a cake shop where you buy and hold paper cake tokens instead.

CME's futures have a lot more volume than CBOE but they're both guilty:
