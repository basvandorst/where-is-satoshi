Thanks, I'll check it out.

Hey, thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-08-23 23:04:04
How? Did you use Safello, or one of the other online exchanges?
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:16:36
Wow. Thank you so much! These are my very first bitcoins, you can't believe how excited I am right now.
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:03:06
I see, thank you for the references. I'm new to all of this, and confused intrinsic value with being a good store of value. Again, thanks for correcting me.

I see, I was mistaken.
My thinking was so: if the Bitcoin Core devs switched away from Bitcoin and made a new cryptocoin, maybe to fix some (hypothetical) limitations in Bitcoin, BTC could be completely replaced.
But I guess instead of doing that, they could simply improve Bitcoin itself. Plus, it's unlikely they'd replace something so early in its infancy.

I've been an Apple user since 2006. Loved getting the latest devices, and I was pretty much a typical Apple fanboy. But then I got bored of Apple. To me, their keynotes were getting less and less interesting, the "amazing", "incredible", and "revolutionary" they kept repeating felt empty, and I was pissed at all the restrictions (seriously, why would Apple ban Bitcoin apps for so long? what else will they ban in the future? now the only Bitcoin apps in the App Store are horribly shitty, because devs didn't have time to iterate upon them as they did on Android).
Last month I decided to buy a Galaxy S5, and frankly, I don't see myself going back to the iPhone. Seeing this latest event only reinforced that; all that hype, just for bigger phones and a watch (i.e. exactly what everybody was expecting) was intensely underwhelming.
Now my only regret is getting the S5 instead of waiting for the Nexus X.

Yeah uh who the hell are those guys?

Now that's an interesting discussion.
There are plenty of economists and other experts who warn about an upcoming financial crisis. [Here]( is a good video explaining the workings of our current monetary system, made fragile by deficit spending and fractional reserve lending, and why it might well collapse soon.
Here's one problem which needs to be put on the table if we want to debate Bitcoin's value properly: we need to differentiate between money and currency: currency (e.g. Dollar, Euro, etc) has no intrinsic value; it's easily used for barter, but it can lose pretty much all of its value through deflation. Money can be used for barter, but has intrinsic value (e.g. gold, silver), unlike currency. If the monetary system crashes, paper dollars will have no value, but gold will still have value.
Now, all currencies that have ever existed have all failed after some point, because they have no intrinsic value, and governments can print them. Gold and silver have been money for centuries, simply because they can't be printed.
Bitcoin has advantages and disadvantages: it can be traded very easily without middlemen, which makes it great for barter. It also can't be printed, just like metals. *But*, it has no intrinsic value (as Warren Buffet and others have pointed out), and it's still speculative at this point, which means that when the financial crash comes, people might either rush into Bitcoin for the super-easy ability to trade it, or rush away from Bitcoin because it's never been "stress-tested" during a crisis and they have more confidence in metals. During previous crises, people sought refuge in metals to escape from currency devaluation; crypto-currencies are a new phenomenon, and may or may not take the status of "money refuge" alongside precious metals.
Either way, the price of Bitcoin will likely go way up, or way down during this very decade, depending on how people respond to the crisis. I think Bitcoin stands a pretty good chance, but let's put everything on the table if we want to have a proper debate here.

Except Apple's two-factor is **incredibly** shitty. You can login through icloud.com and access calendars, emails, plenty of very personal info without entering the second-factor code. It's only requested when you're trying to change the password and I think for Find My iPhone, but it's absolutely not on the same level as Google's or Microsoft's.
Not to mention that Apple doesn't support the RFC6238 standard (i.e. Google Authenticator) and uses a proprietary system for code delivery.

I'm in Europe, so Coinbase doesn't work here. I was inching towards Bitfinex or Bitstamp, seeing as they seem reliable and their spread isn't too high. Safello been promoted a lot recently, but their spread is pretty big (25€, about $30), and I'd get the best bang for my buck. There's a single ATM in my country (France) but they take a 10% fee, so not too keen on that.
Do you have any experience with Bitfinex?
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:18:24
Thanks a lot for your responses.
Frankly, realizing this is making me a lot more confident in Bitcoin's value. The more I learn about bitcoin, the more game-changing it seems.

I think the blockchain has intrinsic value as a technology, but Bitcoin has little. Bitcoin could, theoretically, be replaced by another crypto-currency, whereas gold/silver aren't really replaceable.
Also, it's true that the value of gold and silver is mainly derived from investors' confidence that they have historically been good investments during times of crises. Problem is, Bitcoin also has a ton of potential there, but hasn't yet been tested by a financial crisis, and therefore it might react in unpredictable ways.
I think it's going to react well (because Bitcoin is much easier to trade and obtain than gold), but that's speculation at this point.
edit: not sure who downvoted you. I'd prefer it if people here joined into the conversation instead of doing that.

Thanks, I'll look into that!
