Came here to see if this was asked, leaving knowing it will never be addressed.

I'm not sure what's going on with u/btcJeff, think he shuttered his site. You tried Ships and Travel?

A lot of things aren't adding up here.

Maybe it's just the wording of the post. Usually people who are so careless with their words don't understand the details. Admittedly, I jumped at the language.

My bad, it's Ships and Trips Travel. Sorry.

This a joke? Governing BTC and "benevolent dictators"? Lol

Please. This entire AMA is you saying you knew Mark was up to something, but you didn't really know anything, but you knew something, Mark bad, Adam good. No coherent answers, no real talk, not even an actual apology. But hey, you got paid so it's all good, amirite?

I didn't try to book a cruise, but I've used them for flights and the site is coming up ok for me now.
Edit, a link --

Something tells me you don't understand why people have a knee-jerk reaction to terms like "benevolent dictator," like an understanding of history and what has drawn many of us for years to things like btc, years before it was a reality, just a pipedream in the making on cypherpunk and the like.

Damnit, I wish I had a few shekels left to tip you.

Likewise, Thank you for doing exactly that - policing my language and contributing absolutely nothing to the conversation.
