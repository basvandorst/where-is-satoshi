Your asshat tone certainly doesn't seem like you trying to "warn the people over at OB", sounds more like self righteous shit talking.

Oz of Blow? ~1000 bucks tops
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:31:31
No thanks
@_date: 2017-01-27 19:27:35
Its was an entertaining couple days though

I originally bought 1 BTC for ~740 in order to buy some new shoes from OB, flash forward a few months I'm still wearing my old shoes and my BTC is up significantly. Hurray for Bitcoin.

The DOW is at all time highs, what recovery?
@_date: 2016-11-10 23:03:40
Right. That and GDP/Unemployment Rate. What would you suggest? 
@_date: 2016-12-12 17:01:12
LOL I just saw a post there for "A prayer to get anything you want (REAL)". 
Edit: Just found "Tutorial: Erwin Santos teaches Justine DeCello how to perform fellatio", apparently someone is posting about this guys affair with Justine, there are multiple posts referring to this extra marital relationship. There is some truly funny stuff over at Pastecoin. Cool idea though.

Yes it was so we didn't have to see 20+ posts about the price. That gets annoying quick
@_date: 2016-11-30 17:36:29
Not true at all

But the "yellow cake" claims were what were actually used as evidence to congress to invade Iraq. That didn't exist and was fabricated.
edit source: 
the chemical weapons claim was put as justification after that fact
@_date: 2016-12-01 17:59:01
miniscule? how do you figure that?
@_date: 2016-11-30 17:40:08
again false 
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:37:09
I wonder how this would play out in the US, with companies like Western Union making tremendous profit from transferring money I'd imagine they would fight it tooth and nail. does Australia not have these huge business interests fighting this?

"Such millennial morality"
Says the douchebag

I also work in oil and gas, the down turn hurt the industry bad and many people found new jobs/industries but the fracking companies in my area starting to cope with lower prices and drill again.

If I was a Dream Market user I would be very concerned now. This dude was an Admin with an unencrypted laptop AND didn't dispute his identity. What an asshat 
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:18:26
edit: obviously this relates to my area specifically but I've seen similar trends with other colleagues around the country. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:57:33
They likely don't want evidence, only to act like a shithead
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:51:26
Right look at how many upvotes some of the absolute bullshit speculation comments have garnered
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:37:14
Jeff Sessions? I didn't know you were on reddit
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:40:10
Agreed many of the comments here are ignorant as fuck. Its kinda funny if it was so lame.
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:10:03
Just looked her up in Wikipedia and the section "bitcoin debacle" of her page tries to gloss over that fuck up. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:02:05
Lol tell that to Europeans 
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:20:51
Great Book
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:09:24
Good point, didn't consider that. Very difficult to subvert human greed. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:11:02
Wouldn't current millionaires say the same thing? They got rich from taking a business risk, that you did not take? Not talking the trust fund kids, although I think its likely there will be trust fund kids with millions in Crypto in a generation or two.
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:28:42
People were slaughtered by the millions tho

"Economic depressions are magnificent social colonics, as they wash away all of the filth that accumulated in the prior age"
Apparently this dude hasn't been observing the obscene consolidation by the wealthy following the great recession, or the depression for that matter. The wealthiest people gobbled up assets for cheap and now sit even higher on the throne of wealth.
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:17:44
Same thing happened on the 30s dude
