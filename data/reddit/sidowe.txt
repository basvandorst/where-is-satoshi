Also you seem really lost, so you probably did not know what I meant by free markets can regulate things.  We have the FDA right?  They supposed to keep us safe from drugs and food.  But often they are corrupted by monopoly interests who want to ban competition.  This stops life saving drugs from hitting the market.  It also allows dangerous chemicals and poisons to enter our food and people think its ok since its allowed by the FDA.  What if instead we had a free market institution formed privately, called the FreeDA.  The FreeDA could assign their own certifications to companies that wish to be certified.  They can certify things organic, they could put their stamp of approval on new drugs.  The free market could decide if they trust the FreeDA's opinion.  Maybe the FreeDA is doing a sucky job, and are being corrupted like the FDA now.  Well guess what then we can have a competing institution created by the free market called FreeDA2.  FreeDA2 is more honest and does a better job than the FreeDA1, so people start giving them more trust than the FreeDA1.  They hate that corrupt garbage FreeDA1 so they choose to trust FreeDA2 instead.  People can decide for themselves which drugs are ok to use, which foods are good based on free market regulation.  Today you can't do that because we have a monopoly on regulation.  In a free market system, if corruption arises, then competition stamps it out.  Please please please understand.  Its not that difficult really.

Sounds like Bitcoin is a legal tender in NH if this passes.  Then the IRS can eat shit as we don't owe capital gains anymore when we spend Bitcoin.

Also check out Peter Schiff recently, predicting all of this:

No I didn't see that, but its not too surprising.  It just sounds really weird to me sometimes.  If they replaced blockchain with "blockchain technology" it would sound better, or if they said "Blockchains are used for this or that."  Real Bitcoiners or cryptocurrency advocates would never say it the way they do, so it makes you wonder if they are just really clueless to what its all about.

I can't vouch for their integrity as I have not used them.  But you may try [cryfter](  It appears they sell pre-paid visa gift cards for Bitcoin.  Also [paxful]( is a peer to peer site that seems to trade in Bitcoin and pre-paid cards.

Ok, well just enjoy it when you no longer have your public sector job to suck off us anymore.

I knew someone would ask source.  I tried finding the video earlier but couldn't find it, but just looked again here is a good video by Mike Maloney explaining it: 
@_date: 2015-09-17 01:57:12
Well it still sounds kind of stupid I think.  They should say "blockchain technology" if they want to talk about it that way.

Its not difficult to understand.  Capitalism has provided freedom and prosperity throughout history, and communism and socialism has provided 100s of millions of innocent people dead under Mao and Stalin.  Take your pick.  I never look at things as black or white, the world is never that simple.  But what is simple is that capitalism works, and governments only wreck the free market causing regulatory capture and problems.  Anything that government does the free market can do better.  But you don't understand that.  You think that things need to be regulated.  I think they should be regulated too, but not by governments.  The free market should regulate things.  You are the one looking at things black and white thinking, only government can regulate things.  There are many ways free markets regulate themselves and they have incentive to do it much better than governments.  When governments regulate things they turn into monopolies because big companies buy off the government to put their competition out of business.  With free market regulation there is competition not monopolies which reduces corruption.  There will always be problems in the world, and free market isnt perfect but its the best system we have ever had.  It has resulted in the most propserity.  The United States had the most free market capitalist system in the world and that is why they created so many technologies and inventions ushering in the industrial revolution.  Now since the country is turning communist from within, all of our prosperity is going away.  Hope you understand now.  Hope you can wake up from your television induced trance.

Well that is good lawyer argument, but there are lawyer arguments on the other side as well.  Would be interesting how that holds up in court if the IRS tries to charge someone for not paying Bitcoin tax.
@_date: 2015-09-17 05:34:32
That is a dumb comment.  Obviously there can be more than 1 blockchain.  They could speak of it as blockchains plural, or blockchain technology, but no they just say "Blockchain".  They sound as retarded as you.  You seem like the one who is a moron and can't understand English.
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:21:56
Well its because corrupt interests have gotten in control of banks, and government.  They used this power to enrich themselves while sucking off of the rest of us.  They have more than quadrupled the money supply since the 2008 banker bailouts.  They are basically keeping interest rates at 0 injecting the failing economy with free money.  It works in the short term to prop things up.  They use it to prop the stock market up as well, whenever it crashes they use the plunge protection team and buy it up again.  It can only last so long.  Its kind of like injecting heroin into the economy.  It works for the short term but then you get so addicted you need more and more.  Now we are so addicted to the 0% interest that if it is ever raised the withdrawals will be so horrible that things will collapse much worse than in 2008.  If they keep injecting the heroin then you have to realize it can't go on forever, the money is being debased.  Its only a matter of time before this house of cards falls.

No its not about right.  You are completely mischaracterizing and oversimplifying what I said and using a strawman.
Seems you do not want to realize the truth, and just want to live in fantasy land.  You completely ignored what I said then made some fairytale up.  Check out Peter Schiff's youtube videos, he breaks it down for you to understand.  But my guess is you do not want to know the truth you just want to stick your fingers in your ears and close your eyes to reality.
@_date: 2015-09-17 22:58:37
Yeah exactly, every government organization can make any claims they want, it doesn't make it true.  What happens when multiple government organizations within the same government contradict each other?  This is the world we sadly live in.
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:10:53
government=mafia  stupidoes looks like a government operative.  If not he is at least a public sector worker getting paid by our tax money while sucking off of us since he can't get a real job like the actual ones that produce things in the economy.  The cognitive dissonance is strong in these ones.
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:47:12
Yeah you are, u even had to ask the question before if you are right.  I told you you are wrong, and now you say no you are right again.  If you were so sure you were right then why did you ask?  Asking obviously shows you are lost.  I don't have time for lost people, I will move on to someone who is not a brainwashed jellyfish, find someone who matters.
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:08:14
When the government comes down on you, nobody will care either.
@_date: 2015-09-17 22:41:03
Good. That is the right spirit to have.  I would check out Peter Schiff's videos on youtube.  He is a pretty smart and reasonable guy, he understands freemarkets and capitalism, and is good at explaining it and poking holes in the anti-capitalist arguments.  He even criticizes Bitcoin, which is one of the few points I disagree with him on, even though he does accept Bitcoin for his gold business.  
These debates have been going on for a long time, I would suggest watching the following two videos from the 70s by the famous economist Milton Friedman a self-proclaimed libertarian with a "small l" and a classical liberal in the vein of Thomas Jefferson.  Its pretty entertaining and also educational and enlightening:
He also predicted Bitcoin very acurately in 1999:

Also you have to realize interest rates have never been this low this long, and they have never printed this much money in all of history.  This is unprecedented territory we are in right now.
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:29:50
If 46K euros is significant to you then why were you risking this much in an account that you don't control?  Didn't you know you needed permission to get the money or if the coins got hacked or stolen, lost, you would lose everything too?  Seems like an expensive lesson to learn.  Learn how to hold your own private keys.
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:45:43
Its really tiring debating the pro-Fed anti-capitalist people on here.  There is a lot of them.  Wish I had more time to educate them.
@_date: 2015-09-17 03:16:54
This is a huge strawman against libertarians.  Libertarians have nothing against banks.  Banks exist in a capitalist freemarket, its when they team up and buy off governments so they can print the money out of thin air and get trillions in the 2008 banker bailouts that libertarians don't like.  What is wrong with you?
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:12:45
Stop trolling man, get a life.
@_date: 2015-09-17 18:15:17
What are you talking about bro?  Sidestepping what issue?  Nobody said Bitcoin is magical or makes it so there is no need for banks.  The strawmans continue.  Libertarians have no problem with banks.  We want free markets to fix things since governments never fix things and only make things worse.  This type of senseless argument that you are making is why our country is in so much trouble.  Please just wake up, we are in huge trouble, we need people to wake up from their television induced trances.
@_date: 2015-09-17 18:13:07
I dont know maybe.  But you would not go around saying "Internet is a great technology". Or "Our company is starting to use Internet to connect to people".  It sounds weird I think.

Any business in the USA is illegal.  In fact the average American commits 7 felonies per day and they have no clue about it.  The government or some rogue elements in the government can come arrest you anytime for any reason they want.  You need a license to even be a hairdresser.  I would suggest saying fuck the rules, go anonymous, and just do business black market agorist style.  You will thank me one day.
@_date: 2015-09-17 18:12:01
What are you talking about man?  You are really lost.  Its really disturbing seeing so many lost people like yourself who do not understand the difference between communism and capitalism.  This is why our country is in so much trouble.  Just stop.
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:32:15
They can't raise interest rates, it will trigger an economic collapse the likes of which the world has never seen.  They can't keep printing free money out of thin air either.  Catch 22 scenario.  Bitcoin moon soon.
