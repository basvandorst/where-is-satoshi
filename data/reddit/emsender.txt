   I may not agree or support all of these guy's outlook or opinions, but they've helped to spread the word to larger audiences

1) call for regulations
2) complains against regulations
   Theory 1- His previous stance was the real one, this article is written by someone else as a PR effort to gain the community back. Succeeded in even getting a public apology from evorhees.
   Theory 2- Incompetent business leader with millions on venture capital invested in his project, does not have the slightest idea of how regulators and regulations really work.
   Regardless of which theory is right, would you trust this person as a community "leader" or would you invest millions in his projects? Could this be another disaster in the making? It would not be the first time that an incompetent manager aided by great PR gets to fly high in Bitcoin, just to crash down hard some time later. Mounty Karpeles and Neo Brewster would be proud. Bitcoin seems to attract stratospheric levels of professional incompetence...and still people "thank" them for their continuous changes of mind, defend them or justify their actions. Bitcoiners sometimes...

Interesting coincidence someone with the same name "died" in Cyprus a year before, details not clear
    
"Companies House has confirmed there has been no change to the ownership of the company and Mr Brewster remains as the sole director. The accounts are currently overdue.
An email address was provided for those who had lost money to try and obtain a refund."

If you find many people that do the same thing it can get complicated.
Suggestion: if you find that you can't make everyone agree, set up three or more teams with the same goal and make them compete. Then the community will choose who's the winner. The worst thing that can happen is that you end up with several different styles of good quality ads.

Guys, cut him some slack. The guy is leading not one, but THREE revolutionary companies and dealing with decisions that literally involve rocket science. 
And yet his day has, like ours, still 24h.
It would be nice if he knew more about it, but a man in his position 1) pays people to know more than him about it and 2) whenever he wants to know about it, he'll take 10 mins to learn what others take a year, and he'll start to generate ideas around it in a way that 99.5% of the population of the world can't.

Marketing technique to create expectation. It has a two-punch effect in the mind of the consumer and helps to keep their product in their mind for longer. It is the same concept why nested stories hold attention over time. (opening a story, not closing it and starting a new one. Comedians do this all the time to hold attention)

Amazing, Roger. Thank you for following through and sticking for what you believe in, in a world so devoid of principles and honour. Not many men like you are left, but it's a pleasure to see that there are still some amongst us.

Your comments here and this article are the stuff history is made of. We do not realize it so much because we're in the middle of it. I am saving these webpage.
Imagine when they start issuing their central Bitcoin and we have to explain to the plebs "you know what is Bitcoin, right? Everybody does! Well, this new currency by the Bank of X is just like Bitcoin, but totally controlled by a central party. On the other hand, Bitcoin is much stronger because it's not controlled by a central party. This currency is just a poor and weaker copy of Bitcoin."
My point is that one day almost everyone could be familiar with Bitcoin and by its mere existence and ability to "stay" people will be more comfortable with Bitcoin than with these copies (if by then they still have the option to choose how to store their money)
Funny thing is that the main argument of why people don't adopt Bitcoin today, will play against the banks in the future: "I'll stay with Bitcoin, which is what I know, thank you"
Turning of the tables indeed. Maybe not the plebs, but the wealthiest people on the planet are not stupid. Where do you think their capital will flee into when something like that happens?

He also said:
"Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose."
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:08:11
That's exactly what I meant when I said "if they still have the option of choosing where they put their money". The current corrupt governments will not go down without a fight, and they won't hesitate to use all sorts of violence -physical and legal- to extract all the wealth they can get to.

Good idea. Always ignore the naysayers, unless they propose a good alternative to what you propose.
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:11:04
It is a lose-lose situation. If it goes up, they'll quickly forget it was you who introduced them to it, and think instead that they're very smart. 
If it goes down, they'll blame it on you forever.

I may be wrong, but was it not somewhere that printers and photocopiers keep a copy of everything you print, or was it only a timestamp they keep? I don't trust my printer anymore...

lol your question is so funny you made me sign in just to comment. The price of Bitcoin is so volatile no one can predict it accurately for the next 60 hours, let alone the next 60 months. Learn more about Bitcoin and take your own decisions based on that.

I watched the "predictions" video and only saw a mostly white-upper middle class- bunch of losers complaining about how they're being pushed out of business. The state of the press in the UK is pitiful and they have not done much to improve it. They've been for long in bed with politicians and corporations merely repeating what they're told without any worthy analysis. New business models will push out of public scene and bring them down to the level they deserve to be at.
    In the video you can feel that they see themselves as trendy and progressive but they're as conservative and elitist as their predecessors have been.
...and then their fears: OMG we're going to see more trolling on the net OMG we must control it OMG someone can blog without going to uni OMG OMG OMG and people are reading it OMG OMG!!
    Particularly funny was to see the author try to cling -thinking in the usual old-fashioned ways- to payment per time reading:
    "For every minute I remain reading articles, my browser continues making those little payments and as soon as I leave that website to return to Twitter my browser stops making the payments."
    Well, they have a hard lesson coming, because I think people will pay for quality with Bitcoin, not time, regardless of how shiny is your website or connected you are or how many twitter "followers" you have. 
    I think the smartest among them can see this, and they're terrified. The rest -majority- are too dumb to even see this coming, but they're terrified too 
    The coming world is a rather transparent meritocracy with little -if any- corruption in which the best are rewarded handsomely, but people like these are forced to go back to their parent's house in the countryside until they get better at their craft, if ever.
