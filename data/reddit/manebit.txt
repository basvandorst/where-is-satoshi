True to a point. But using the same time frame as the difficulty (2048 blocks), would be a great starting point.
You'd have a check statement every 2016 blocks, similar to the difficulty check statement.
Another approach would be an internal exponential scaling factor. That way you could easily compensate for the difference between the two adoption curves.

As in, P2Pool is acting out of the norm. They are mining, but including little to no transactions in their mined blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:47:58
great plan. Just link the block size to scale with the difficulty factor. This allows for moore's law to take its course properly along with nullifying future complications.

Seems to be someone attempting to reach 1,000,000 tBTC.

why 144?

Yes, same here!

These coins were auctioned off.
@_date: 2014-02-03 03:14:24
This is the worst possible thing for Bitcoin.
Think about it, there are supposed to be only 21 million Bitcoins in existence and people are just going to throw away BTC?
Why??? I understand that this would make the value go up but the whole point of Bitcoin is to make it a global currency, not some elitist exchange protocol.

I paid $740 for them, including shipping. 
I've considered repairing them but then I looked at the PCB. It's double sided so that's one difficult soldering job to be done.

The seller had 95.7% reputation. They only had one bad review and that was for slow shipping.

I've turned my guestroom into a sort of "lab" for all my techy needs. I'll probably get rid of the bed and put a center workbench there instead.

If a currency continues on a hyper-deflationary path then what's the point of spending it today when it could be worth more tomorrow?

Screw these guys. They are some of the biggest sticklers in present bureaucratic existence. Assholes told me that a package I had was overweight by 5 ounces. 
Furthermore, they said they couldn't print new postage in the office? So... I had to drive all the way home, affix the stamp, and drive back. But guess what? They closed on me, an hour earlier than they were supposed to.
Even if they accept bitcoin, I will never use them. It's a regulatory bureaucratic disaster waiting to happen. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:24:03
Can someone explain this to me? How the hell can you have a standalone blockchain without a cryptocurrency holding it together?
I feel like this is something investors don't get. You can't just decentralize data in a blockchain without some (mining) incentive holding it together.

Well yes, as of right now it's just the bootstrap.dat file. 
I'm planning on creating an open source autoinstaller that would allow newcomers to quickly download and automatically install the bootstrap.dat file and extract it to the full Blockchain in their Bitcoin appdata folder.
The same would go for all the altcoins out there.

From what I've learned, when people start saying things like "Oh, it will never fail" and "It's been around for decades, it can't collapse now" you know shit is about to hit the fan.

Indeed! The problem is conventional investors are not used to Bitcoin's volatility, and in fact that's what scares most of them away.
If they want to survive, they have to adapt to the new atmosphere of the 21st century.

Quick question, I see you are using a modified version of mmcFE...
Who updated the code to support the new RPC?
Also, are you willing to share the updated code?
