Great news, however, not sure how you can have Bitcoins and be homeless.... Can they not exchange out?

I shudder to think that Coinbase will be playing the Paypal routine of locking accounts etc... This is Bitcoin for crying out loud.. Why are they running it like the PayPal dinosaur...

Things are just not adding up.

I dont understand. Your website says.. 
"Our speakers will explain us the Bitcoin mechanism and tell us why, in their opinion, the Thai authorities have made such a decision (a first worldwide)."
How can you discuss legal issues, when you state that Thailand has made a decision, based on a statement by bitcoin.co.th that is proving to be false. Are you aware that the reported Department that supposedly issued the statement does not exist? Shouldnt the discussion be about the validity of that worldwide statement... Bitcoin.co.th has sure made a mess for Bitcoiners in Thailand... Disgraceful!

Further to that. Thailand has not banned Bitcoin. We started investigating further and there is some debate as to who is saying what.
