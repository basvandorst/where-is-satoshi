no a dollar is a dollar, independent on how it is written somewhere, in your bank account, or floating on a bill or in coins. A bitcoin is a bitcoin, independent how it is written, in the blockchain or floating in a LN payment channel. That is the analogy.

It is based on bitcoin and secured by the blockchain. You open a payment channel with some other one and put real bitcoin in that channel. From that moment, there is some balance in the channel, and payment / receivements are done by exchanging bitcoin transactions between those two participants of the channel, changing this channel balance, without writing those bitcoin transactions on the blochchain. The channel can be open forever. When you are done, the last transactions are written to the blockchain.


It is not custodian.


yes security is provided by bitcoin blockchain


It will never be as fast as Lighting Network, while you are doing bitcoin payments with Lightning Network, Also they are private / anynomous.


No they are not more secure, LN has the security of Bitcoin


I expect limits are temporary, LN is still not completely developed yet.
Keep in mind the fee of LN transactions are very low, they are very fast and private, so private microtransactions are made possible by LN.

To be more clear, every receive address is deterministictly derived from your seed, represented by your pass phrase. As long as you remember your pass phrase, the wallet will regenerate that exact same receive address again, as long as there is no tansaction made to that address.
So generate that address and forget it; it does not matter if you received bitcoin on it or not. It is your address and only yours; it is bound to your seed pass phrase.
As stated elsewhere, however you can, you better not reuse an address you received bitcoins on in an earlier transaction for privacy reasons. Just generate a new receive address for every single transaction. You can have as many receive addresses as you want, based on your seed pass phrase. No one is able to link the receive adresses you generated from your seed pass phrase to another receive address based on your seed. It is a one way derivation. No one is able to calclulate your seed public adress based on a derived receive address. So no one can aggregate your received money in your wallet, when you do not reuse receive addresses and as long no one knows your seed public address.
YES! It is magic. Thanks to the deterministic and hierarchical characteristics of your wallet software.

1. the 24 words are determistic derived from the private key. From this 24 words, the private key is determistic derived. It is bi-directional; the 24 words is just another representation of your private key. You can derive the 24 words from the private key and the other way arround.
2. The process is as follows: On blockchain check money sent to (derive public bitcoin addres from (derive public key from (derive private key from master private key (derive master private key from 24 words)))) and accumulate this money to the balance value in your wallet software. The only deriavation that is bi-directional is the derivation of the private key from the 24 words, all other derivations are one direction only because of the nature of cryptography.
3. I do not know what you mean by "verify address"
4. The wallet software decides how much fee is putted in a transaction. The higher the fee, the more change a miner will pickup your transaction to put in a block.
5. a. BTC is only a concept, BTC does not exists physically. The transaction that party A paid party B is stored on the blockchain, the ledger of Bitcoin. The blockchain can not be altered. The blockchain is distributed across many computers on the internet; so it is in the cloud. To pay money from address A to address B, you need the private key of address A (see answer 2 for derivation of the address from your 24 words).  
b. The only thing you have to remenber is the private key. From the private key, you can calculate the public key and then the public bitcoin address. To be even more concrete, you need to remember the 24words and share this with no one (except with me).

No it is but op is talking about Samourai, and I am almost sure that is a HD wallet.
But indeed, not HD wallet reserves some private address on forehand, which are not derived or dependent on each other. But then, you better make a backup of your wallet regular, because otherwise, new allocated private addresses with bitcoins will lost after you loose your wallet.
Unique to a HD wallet is, you only need to backup (remember) your pass phrase.

Well some can be assumed with a certain level of certainty: if the price will go up, more miners will mine, even only for the transaction fee. If the price will go down, it is not rendable to compete with other miners, so there will be less miners.
So the higher the price, the more safe the Blockchain will be; and the opposite. The safety of the blockchain is organic dependent on the price. It is balanced.

Another thing is this:
Your public bitcoin address is derived as follows.
You start out with an private key. From that key, the public key is derived. After thad, the hash is taken from the your public key. This is your public bitcoin address. It is one way: you can not derive the input value (the public key) from the hash. You can not derive the private key from the public key. However, it is much more (and then I mean much more) difficult to derive the public key from the hash, than the private key from the public key.
As long als you only receive new bitcoins on a bitcoin addres, only that bitcoin address is readable on the blockchain.
However, when you pay that bitcoin, your public key is written on the blockchain. So it is better to spend all your bitcoins of an address, because then there is no money anymore associated with the readable public key. It will then never be used again. If there are more receivenments on one address, the change is, you do not spend all the coins of that address. However, if you received only one transaction on an address, always all bitcoin on that address will be spend when you do a payment. A part of the bitcoin is sent to the public address of the other party you are paying. The rest of that bitcoin is sent to a new address in your wallet.
Do not confuse this with how private key's are derived from your seed. Your wallet had one master seed private key. From this master private key, other private key's are derived to receive transactions. From that private key, the public key, and the public address (hash) is derived. 
When you start your wallet software, the sofware is just trying to derive private key's from the master key (seed) and checks if there belongs bitcoins to the public address of that key and accumulates the value. It stops when it find a address whitout any transaction to that address. So the derivation of key's from the seed is done dynamically, when you start your wallet software.
Please backup your seed (represented by the pass phrase), otherwise you loose your money.

That 'something you are talking about is the picture or movie of the situation. It needs to be in the picture at the moment the picture is taken. So I want to write it down on paper to make the photo inclusive that paper. It is a bit impractical to write down a blockid, so I want a short derivate of this block id. Important is I can not predict a derivate of a future blockid.
I do not need to link this picture back to the blockchain because I do not need to prove BEFORE what time the picture is shooted. I want to prove the existence of the situation AFTER a given time, what must not be in the future.
@_date: 2018-10-17 06:43:06
I do not think I want that. I only want to prove the ssituation AFTER a certain time. It is also more easy to implement, no need to change the blockchain.

I must write it down and put the written code in the picture in a way I could not do this by editing the picture.

Well, sure someone can do that, but I cannot do that. I am not that handy. And when I make a video instead of a picture, moving the paper with code in my hand, it will be even more difficult. The longer the movie the more difficult and time-consuming to spoof that movie.

Before there was Bitcoin, I always thought, why couldn't we just have digital money? Money we can send each other directly. That would be very efficient.
I did not understood it: Why isn't it there? The technology is there, we can sign transactions?
But somewhere I understood, without able to identify the problem, there is a double spending problem. I did not know it has a name. And to solve the double spending problem, there is a need of a central database to register which coin is already used.
Then I red about Bitcoin. It was a eureka to me. But I was also disapointed. 
Eureka: With Bitoin, I have my central database, it is distributed. I never thought of that solution.
But I was also disapointed because it is a very expensive solution. And with very, I really mean VERY.
I am a software and database designer and I dislike to replicate data. It does not sound good. Now this database of Bitcoin is very duplicated, storing the same data a lot of times, and that is very inefficient, but I knew that is the only solution to make Bitcoin the money of the people.
But, I realized even, it is a VERY expensive solution, because of the need of the puzzle (the mining) to keep the database distributed.
But despite of this drawback, I was (and I still am) a very big Bitcoin believer.
Then I red about Lightning Network. That made me very happy. With that solution, I have what I wanted: sending coins directly to other people, without the need to trust anybody.
I fully agree with OP. Be efficient. Develop smart solutions instead of expensive solutions. Blockchain is an expensive solution and I would only use that when needed. It is like developing database application software: First design smart software, which queries the database in an efficient way by doing it smart. Do not query records you do not need, because the database is slow. Then, after you made the application software smart and it is still too slow, only then add memory and very fast disk space to the database engine. Because if you do it the other way around, then, first of all, you are not a smart developer. But secondly, even more important, you could have used your maximum reserve of upgrading the database server, and not solved your problem.

O thank you very much, so Electrum Personal Server (EPS) is the way go? I have to say, it was much easier setting up EPS than the Bitcore server. That is a pain in the ass. I needed to edit source code to solve problems and I have still problems left.
I have two problems with the EPS solution:
First, your software is still in beta. I do not have problems testing beta stuff, but when I want to use it for real, then I do not like running things in beta. How do you think about this?
Second, I want to run EPS on my linux server, while using Electrum on my laptop. As you advices, I configured EPS to only accept local connections. So I need to use a SSH tunnel to use this system setup. I am not a linux expert, I am able to set that up, but it is not very stable because of my lack of knowledge about SSH.

Not every Lightning node has enough energy (funds) to pass the energy forward.
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:25:56
I do not know. I use a standard setup op Ubuntu. I do not know under which account auto start-up applications run. Do you know?
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:56:59
Find the best contributors to the lightning-rfc (BOLT) and you have the candidates for Satoshi if he still lives.

Why is it not highly unpractical to have all the money allocated in the bank while people need to use the money?
Maybe better to put just enough money in your 'bank channel' to pay you taxes, and nothing more than that, otherwise you can not spend than money on lightiing.

LN makes more use cases possible Visa never dreamed about... such use cases requures more txs per second.
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:34:57
I think you are right. How can I kill the X auto-mounter?
@_date: 2018-06-03 09:05:39
It works. I disabled auto mount from the "disks" application and added the mounting to /etc/fstab manually. Auto starting bitcoin\-qt in Startup Applications works after that.
You are my hero.

This is the answer to his question
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:05:30
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:07:55
Why was I affraid of that? Thanks. Now I know why I am doing all this shit.
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:11:21
1. I assume, the public key's or bitcoin addresses I am watching, are send to Trezor's Bitcore servers, so:
1.1. Trezor know's which bitcoin adresses belongs together;
1.2. Trezor know's which IP adress is wachting those bitcoin addresses
2. Also, I assume, when I send money, the transaction localy generated for that, is also send to Trezor's Bitcore servers. So then Trezor knows which transaction history belongs to what IP address.
I assume issue 1.2 and issue 2 I can solve using Tor. But I do not think I can solve issue 1.1 using Tor (because I assume the Master Private Key is sent to the Trezor's Bitcore servers).
**Using own node**
When I run my own node, the blockchain is locally stored, so no need to query a server on the internet for watchin my addresses. Also, when I send a transaction via my own full node, the origin of that transaction is not known by the bitcoin peer to peer network.
Are my assumptions incorrect?
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:57:02
This is not an answer to his question
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:24:52
do  you have references?
@_date: 2018-06-28 12:47:48
True you can spend everybody connected to LN if there is enough liquidity in the path. I expect and hope liquidity will be slowly increased when the adoption of LN will grow, and so will your money in LN channels be more usable (you don't want that on a bank anymore). This is hope about the future.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:00:56
@_date: 2018-06-28 12:50:07
Also in the future you don't know you have multiple channels open to the lightning network. You LN wallet will manage that for you.
@_date: 2019-08-05 07:36:52
Isnt that what computers do, repeating things over and over?
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:09:25
done! thanks. Now I will work on mounting the device in /etc/fstab. Correctly?
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:21:49
Thank you!
1. I was suspecting that answer :). 
2. Thanks for the tip and how clear it is stated to not use this on the public internet. So I think I just need SSH.
3. ;)
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:48:18
How can I run Electrum through a SSH tunnel?
@_date: 2018-06-08 09:54:55
What are your costs and what is in?
@_date: 2019-10-07 18:37:01
Interesting. Also:


@_date: 2018-06-26 15:54:55
How much can it be in the future do u think?
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:15:17
He is asking how a wallet knows all the private keys while his backup is only one. He is not questioning how to come from 12 words to a number.
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:25:17
Nice thank u
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:46:33
Is that your private key?
@_date: 2019-08-05 07:42:53
When i was a programmer and my boss asked me how many time bulding some new functiinality costs me and I answered,  the thing I have to build is a bit complex while explaining the complexity,  he answered always: aah come on,  it are just some IF statements.
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:04:48
No tried already that, same result: path not found.
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:43:14
Thanks for your answer. I tried in [wallet.trezor.io]( to "Show XPUBs". Well, it worked without the need of any interaction with the Trezor device. 
And this is expectable. I think, it needs to be possible to get every public key from the device, on any level in the key derivation path's, so also the XPUB. Every wallet uses its own key derivation path's.
So, I assume I have the trust the software in my browser it is not sending the XPUB to Trezor's Bitcore servers (and ask that in the trezor reddit)?
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:06:31
Is this a new expression? My two sats instead of my two cents? Very nice.
@_date: 2018-06-15 21:41:47
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:04:31
Maybe double spended transactions.
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:01:36
Sugarrrrrrrr. It is used for drugs and I do not.think these kids will pay taxes.
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:10:52
thank you for your suggestion for doing more research. Checking my assumptions on reddit is part of my research.
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:40:17
Thanks. Can you give an example with my drive /media/username/Blockchain?
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:56:49

@_date: 2017-11-08 18:02:04
This. And then comes the dump. HODL 
@_date: 2019-12-10 21:37:44
no, 21 million less the count of mine, I am a hodler.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:30:05
with the text in a balloon  the Internet is saying: it is your turn... In the background a graveyard there lying the post branche, music and movie industry (maybe some others too)
And offcource a balloon at Jamie, he complaining: you are a fraud.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:48:54
To confuse everyone
@_date: 2019-04-20 06:52:34
Who the fuck is grandma?
@_date: 2019-12-11 06:53:46
Because there will be less supply  the prise of bitcoin on the markets increase. This will be a slow proces. In the mean time fees will rise, miners drop. Lightning network will be more adopted, it will be logical price of onchain raises. Some of this is already priced in, nobody knows how much. It will be a smooth proces.
No worries. 
@_date: 2019-12-10 21:35:06
It depends on on the size of your internal memory you order with it. But I assume you can upgrade it later on.
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:14:33
you can buy 0,000000001 bitcoin from me
@_date: 2015-07-23 21:00:46
What places are that in the States where all the piles are shooted at?
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:36:50
One icon for each digit?
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:48:02
So only HODL by everyone protects us to this? I think that will never happen unless there is a world wide revolutiion. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:11:48
Lightning Network allows trustless anonymous bitcoin microtransactions limited especially by balance, not block size, yet still secured by the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:38:31
Will BCH have more orpheans than bitcoin because of the bigger blocksize (and lack of improvements) and so you have to have more confirmations to be secure the money is not double spended?
Because the argument of BCH is faster because of blocksize? It has its drawback in orphans and so in number of confirmations to wait, no?
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:45:17
I think NSA is from another planet spying us. The only thing you can do about it is put on your aluminium hood.
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:52:49
sure and only after that they can invest it. However they are garandeed being paid and they can cash more frequently (lets say once a day) than now.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:54:40
... or a collapse of the fiat system. Then everyone will HODL. Also do not forget the influence of global political power struggle what can make this diffigult for goverments. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:41:48
I think Satishi did do a great job to balance blocksize, 10 minutes of mining, network capacity, number of orphans and number of confirmations. Changing one of these parameters has impact on the others I think.
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:43:30


I think Satoshi foresees payment channels, which is Lightning Network an implementation of.
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:07:05
The question I have is: would it ever be possible to have a LN payment processor on a chip? Because then the use cases are huge. For example: to pay the electricity you are using in your house at the moment you use that electricity. Energy companies will be very happy with it.
@_date: 2018-07-03 10:46:26
What is the difference with Electrum Personal Server? What are de advantages?
@_date: 2018-07-15 19:33:09
And bandwith? Because limitid bandwith will result in orphan blocks?
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:57:47
To all those who are online now I wish a very good ride. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 06:35:34
Hardware wallet support
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:30:22
You need fiat for that, what if there is no fiat system anymore?
@_date: 2015-11-10 06:10:20
But they have to know my address to start with. What if I earn anonymous?
@_date: 2018-04-28 08:55:24
So indeed, you can not 'print' new gold \(= bitcoin on the blockchain\), while you can not decouple the 'paper money' \(= Ligtning transaction in this comparison\) from the gold \(bitcoin\), so you can not print new paper money.
It is logical the financial industry and goverment is afraid of Bitcoin. But bitcoin is such very transparent, this is the best solution for our next step in evolution on world level.
There is no need of a 'Big Mac' price index anymore, everything can be relatied to the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-10 06:11:23
What if big transactions are made small?
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:45:29
This is very nice
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:40:33
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:45:52
This is very nice. An animation on top of it showing LN would be very cool.
