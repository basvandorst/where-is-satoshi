I don’t have more evidence, asshole. I’ve been saying allegedly. I’m done with this conversation. Watch it play out and eat your words.

Dude are you even following the full story? You can be a journalist AND also be a criminal by using criminal means to source information. The two are not mutually exclusive.
Assange wasn’t arrested for being a journalist, he was arrested for being a shady actor who used illegal means to steal extremely sensitive information. And not only that, it sounds like there is mounting evidence that he used that information to conspire with foreign governments agains the US. That’s why he was arrested. Innocent til proven guilty, so let this play out in the courts.

Wait, clarify your point on “Russia” what are you even referring to? Not clear. 
All journalists do solicit information, I agree. The illegality of what Assange allegedly did was use illegal means to acquire the info. Reporters can’t break in to someone’s house to dig up a story and claim journalistic freedom as a defense.
Notice I’m saying *allegedly* here. Innocent until proven guilty.

I read as far as “witch hunt” and stopped reading. Just wanted to let you know I’m not wasting my time arguing against a brick wall. Not on a Friday.

You just proved my point. Chelsea illegally acquired the information. Assange allegedly conspired &amp; aided Chelsea in her illegal acts. Full stop. 
What debunked Russia bullshit? Elaborate, little boy.
