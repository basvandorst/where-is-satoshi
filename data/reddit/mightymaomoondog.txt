I never invested in shares but I bought Bitcoin there.  Question, I asked Kraken if they had any downloadable information regarding my purchases with Cavirtex,  they said they didn’t - so how do I produce purchase price evidence for my bitcoin if the CRA request it?  I know what cost avg is but not actual purchase price and dates.  How do I handle this?

I mean, just use Quadrigacx in the first place?  Then send any Bitcoin or Ether to Binance to purchase other alt coins or send to your cold storage or desktop wallet.

Any good capital gains information for Canadians that I can read up on that is straight forward?  I used to be with Cavirtex but they got absorbed by Kraken.  I contacted Kraken support and they have no records from Cavirtex.  I bought a few Bitcoins but cannot recall exact dates but I have a rough idea of my cost average.  Thoughts on how to handle this if I choose to sell a coin?

Ahhh good point, did not realize you could use a cc with Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:19:33
Just use Quadrigacx.

Exactly my perception too and I am in the same boat as you.  I guess we have to always be ready for the big waves.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:16:29
You bet!  Just a little rattled these past few days.

Typical behaviour from Goldman Sachs to make a statement like this.  Don't get me wrong, a correction is likely, proceed with caution (I'm bullish though).  But in typical fashion, Goldman Sachs is trying to exert their influence.  Suspect they have already invested heavily into Bitcoin and are trying to generate a drop in price only to reinvest back in on the dip.  I have seen this happen with Blackberry stock - Goldman Sachs making specifically unfounded comments (not reporting actual facts), causes concerns with investors and the price drops within 24hrs.  Only to rebound shortly thereafter.  I suppose it still will work out in the end for Bitcoin.  Just don't be completely reliant on what Goldman Sachs has to say because their greed is usually at the centre piece of their "caution" press releases.

Your words of support are appreciated.  Great to have this community to reach out and help a fellow Hodler!  Thanks again.

I went through the big decline in 2014 and it didn't phase me at all.  But when your investment grows into something that can take your family towards financial prosperity, it gets pretty real.

Hmmm, just looked up what 'shill' means.  Unfortunate you feel that way.

Thanks for your attention to detail.  I bought my first 2 bitcoins late December 2013, yes I was gripped with FOMO.  The bulk of my purchases were in 2014 and a few more in early 2015.  I just sold my BCC and converted it to BTC.  Do you think I should have kept it instead of converted?  My belief was that BCC price was artificial and not sustainable in the long run.  Sold to bolster my BTC.

Not to mention, Ian very passionate about Bitcoins success, by default, I want everyone to win with Bitcoin.

Nice that we can check in CAD.  Maybe one day we won’t have to because Bitcoin will be everywhere eh?

Thanks for the link, definitely answered my question.

Agreed.  Only my co-workers whom I’ve worked with for over a decade and in some cases 2 decades - the level of trust is paramount and exists between us.

Quadrigacx is very good, I’ve been using them for over a year.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:46:13
One other footnote, one member is my boss :P. Have to keep it honest!
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:45:05
I’m not sure why either, definitely a premium price.  But I understand that from exchange to exchange there are price differences.  Maybe the strategy is buy Bitcoin on exchanges with generally lower prices and sell on Quadrigacx:)

Why not covert to ETH instead of $$$.  Transfer back to exchange with lower BTC price, convert back to BTC.  Monitor all fees to ensure coming out ahead.  Working on a spreadsheet to help coordinate this.  I am with 2 exchanges that typically show $100 difference in price.  Sometimes up to $300.  Could become very lucrative.

Agreed.  His argument appears to be very hollow.  He might as well put his ear plugs in because the Bitcoin party is far from over....in fact, all night long!

You weren't kidding were you :P

Noticed I used a lot of 'my' in my post, should be 'ours'.  Just in case the wife happens to read this, love you babe :P

I've been a long time Hodler, have had a few wavering moments but when I read an article like this and it's all that can be said by a Nobel winning economist...the laughing  and the fighting are almost over :p
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:17:15
Your point is so true.

It did breach $8k, got as high as $8.1k, eh!
