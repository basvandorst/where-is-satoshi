These numbers are bogus and I don't have to even begin to prove it. 48%, that is laughable.

Like I said it's a billboard near my house. Just thought it was weird..

Dear god edit out the parts of you fucking with the camera. It's like nails on a chalkboard for me.

It is a billboard up the street from my place. I thought the reddit community might be able to tell me what the deal is with it. I agree it seems like a lame way to make $. I wouldn't know how to go about getting my own billboard anyways haha. I suppose I should have expected some form of accusation.

next time cue up the video in the right spot. I don't want to watch a shitty rap video in order to see a couple frames

Tell me, can you walk into an electronics store an purchase a 7950. YES! Can you do the same with ASICs???? That's MY definition of normal and available. Also tell me, do FPGAs have the ability to provide large memory caches and a price that isn't astronomical? Regardless of KW/H ratio?
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:53:27
7950's are NORMAL consumer hardware when compared to ASICS and less expensive. They have large amounts of memory making them a better choice over ASICS for Litecoin because ASICS are too expensive to implement large amounts of memory. SCRYPT relies on large amounts of memory, not just fast arithmetic operations. Am I wrong here?

All this helpful info! I'm going to tip you .00001 BTC, or did I want to tip .000001 BTC? Let me get my glasses and pointer out so I can count the zeros, my exhange doesnt use the mBTC prefix, nor does my online wallet :(

please explain why it failed at allowing users to pool mine with normal computer? please.

Cool I wrote all that down. Thanks!

This is amazing. The implications of this idea are staggering if it is successful. I am particularly interested to see the evolution of Bitcoin under a totally different system of governance. When I first started daydreaming about the far reaching implications of Bitcoin, the concept of bringing freedom to those who are otherwise oppressed by corporate and economic climates was the most exciting possibility. Hopefully these Native Americans can use the governments own loopholes against them to make a real difference for their community. It is a community mistreated and neglected by the institutional laws and hopefully, Bitcoin, can offer a way to finally fight back. I love this story!

Thanks for the insightful response. I'm glad you used proof and logic to respond to my points. I was worried that people would just attack me with no basis, but here you proved me wrong!

Ok then, open your mind:
 
1. Litecoin's code has the ability to create 4x the amount of coins overall, somewhere around 84 million or so. This makes it less deflationary and better for smaller purchases because it keeps the price of one coin roughly 4x less than Bitcoin. You might say that because Bitcoin can be divided into tiny decimals this doesn't matter, however receiving .000001 of anything is disheartening and bad for market confidence. Bitcoin can eventually be used for large investments (home buying, retirement savings) and Litecoin for everyday purchases (coffee, online shopping). Think of Bitcoin as gold and Litecoin as silver or what have you.
2. The mining process for Litecoin uses a different hashing algorithm and is not only able to create coins in smaller time intervals, but it also does not rely on processor power/efficiency and uses increasing amounts of memory to make the mining process harder. This puts a stop to the mining arms race created by increasingly hard to get and expensive processors and levels the playing field. We are already seeing the emergence of mining "cartels" in the Bitcoin world and in the end they will hold too much of the bag.
3. Transaction verification is also greatly improved. Whereas Bitcoin takes 10 minutes or more to be safely confirmed by miners, Litecoin is instantaneous in its verification and just as safe. This makes it even more perfect for smaller everyday transactions.
4. Litecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub on October 7, 2011 by Charles Lee, a former Google programmer who worked on projects such as Google Play Games, Chrome OS, and YouTube. He has a  BS and Masters in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT and just recently was hired by Coinbase as a full time employee. In my opinion, I believe that Litecoin will be added to Coinbase very soon because of his recent employment.
If this doesn't convince you then maybe listen to the endless media coverage about Litecoin's success and further potential.

it's not meant to be GPU resistant as GPUs are consumer hardware with high memory cache and more accessible to average people. ASICs have poor memory cache which is bad for SCRYPT. It is estimated that ASICs are reduced 10 fold in efficiency when compared with consumer GPUs. Am I wrong? If so elaborate more.

Litecoin is not a scam and it's not going anywhere IMHO. It's been around longer than the others and was made to address real issues with bitcoin and does a good job at that.
