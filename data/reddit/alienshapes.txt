Seeing the adoption first-hand i tend to disagree. Whenever a superior payment channel is presented, users self-educate and follow accordingly.
Seeing the crooks from the dark web/ ransomware victims catching up so fast to crypto firmed my belief in the masses.

I think they do with their moneypolo and advcash funding methods. They try to stay away from IRS deeming them money launderers i guess.

That is also true. Thanks for the clarification.

How come it's deemed hard to get fiat in or out of BTC-E, for me they've always been the most straightforward. I'm asking because haven't moved fiat with them since 2014.

Thats a damn tough question. Hardware backdoors are hard to overcome. But in reality they are used so rarely that they become less of a concern when you realize you won't be running the Death Star.
Overthinking deep security is the first step to missing on the abc's.

Dont worry about such miniscule amounts. But do know that they will know you're sending the money to a btc-related account and its possible they can question you or stop the transfer. It just depends on bank policy.
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:57:52
Since you're wrapping on the same machine, just make the RPC accessible on loopback or secure with firewall. Otherwise i'd still use stunnel4 for TLS wrapping. But in your case a microservice on the same host and a cold-wallet storage option for majority of funds is gonna be a good call.
Don't worry too much though, that's not rocket science. Tech is reliable by now and tested with years. Don't forget to turn pruning on so blockchain doesn't eat your storage :)

Stock trading has taught me to play the situation and not the anticipation. I would wait for the ETF decision and jump immediately afterwards depeding on the sentiment.
If you truly think of it as an in investment - you can go ahead at once.

I just realized how rigged those mining contracts are. Thank you for the reasonable explanations. People do get hooked on the promise for a static price for an infinite payout as it seems, but rarely factor in the fees.
@_date: 2017-03-12 07:33:43
It is more than feasible. That is the way to go in my oppinion if you are serious about your coin. Bitcoind has a decent RPC stack over which you can slap any wrapper u want. Just remember to secure it as they dropped SSL support awhile back.

Have very little hope for finding a card issuer that is not bound by its sponsor or VISA/MC itself to facilitate KYC.
Apart from that i can point you to worldcore.eu which are pricy, but do the job.

That is not correct. While btc-e had representation in Bulgaria it has no office here. I have talked to support though and they have a cash exchange option in Moscow, Russia.
Message me for another small exchanger that provides btc over the counter.

these gadgets are extremely unreliable. and since they're SoC(system on a chip), if it burns, getting data out of it is hell.
so if u go that way, make sure to have backups on the side.(seeds and logins)

Because that way i would have to automate the fiat settlement myself as the business meets its costs in fiat. It is not impossible, but time consuming.

I can only guess they 'card' the GCs with stolen credit cards and then try to sell them as fast as possible so they get clean btc for them quasianonimously.

I was doing arbitage on gox years ago and wouldnt repeat. Theres a big mismatch between the speed and accountability of blockchain and traditional banking and you get to tie down a ton of money making a few hundreds.

The thing is that the particular story that inspired the author's secops dive is quite farfetched. It was very precisely targetted to an extent that leaves me to believe the victim was very vocal and boastful about his crypto whereabouts.
Having said that i very recently fell victim to phishing and the first thing the attackers tried doing is emptying an exchanger account i have holdings in.
I was in tact because of strong, non-related passwords and my decision to separate different workflows across different machines and accounts.

Register on their ticket system. They will ask for some proof of ID and set your new email accordingly.

I have made that clear so many times. Bitcoin is not suited to driving daily purchases. It is slow, currently expensive and not as user friendly as we all wish. It however is an amazing tool for larger denominations of value transfer. You dont go to the candy store with a fully setup escrow account and you rarely buy houses with your daily credit card.
What we can hope for is either a smaller cryptocurrency taking the change purchases or the LN being implemented so it accounts for sidechained faster transactions.
That leaves us with a lot of room for improvement and experimentation.

But then calculates the price of products with the processing fee upfront. So to the retail user barely anything is without cost

Deterministic wallets don't work like that.  The addresses have been pregenerated for his hd wallet unlike bitcoin-qt wallets where they are generated on-demand(unless configured otherwise). 
So do a repair wallet and you might see your coins back. Then try recovering from seed. Keep in mind multibit had a ton of trouble with wallets lately and you might have to use 0.1.1 to recover properly.

If you buy your coin from Al Capone...
@_date: 2017-04-21 07:13:41
Try to update to a normal wallet for once. MultibitHD has a very high chance of creating problems right now and is barely maintained.

With crypto, you are rarely in that position as you rely on exchanges. And that alone is a factor creating those same discrepancies  that you're eager to exploit. Basically the price differences exist because of how funds are handled in or out of the exchanges and the fees involved with that.

That is not fully correct. Multibit HD uses 24 words for its deterministic wallets. Many of the modern ones use 12 words these days.
@_date: 2017-07-02 03:48:00
You got that wrong. Profitable mining is done via MOON energy.
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:11:23
MultibitHD has a way of fucking up wallets. I would suggest you move to a better maintained wallet. Electrum for example.
Am talking from experience.

Yeah, it is stupid to pay with a credit card and then resent verification. Are your concerns privacy- or comfort-related?

Is this multibit-classic or multibit-HD and which version?
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:25:38
it is a multibit hd bug (un)fortunately. they've let it sit for too long. I suggest moving to Electrum. Let me know if you need to recover any locked coin from your MBHD wallets.

The blacklist did mention it in episodes as means for a value transfer. Person of interest as well. CSI:Cyber has some mentions.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:32:38
if you have a non-corrupted backup, back it up, get mbhd 0.1.1 and start it with it and it will open the wallet. transfer your coins asap out to electrum.
@_date: 2017-06-03 08:41:37
This is something that MBHD does and their team tries to blame it on malleability.
Try to find an uncorrupted backup, open it with MBHD 0.1.1 and re-scan it. Then you empty it and switch to a better maintained wallet.
If you cannot find a backup or your mnemonic, chance for recovery is slimming.
