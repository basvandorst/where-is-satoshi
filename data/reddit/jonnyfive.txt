For accepting online transactions please show me a cheaper processing fee structure for a small business.

Yes, credit card - keyed since its entered by the customer online. It's a digital marketing company.

Can you please give me a recommendation for a better merchant provider for online transactions? I will only be doing about 5 transactions a month for $2K each, all keyed or online. I've been doing a lot of research lately, and am pulling my hair out trying to figure out who to go with!! This is my first business.
Honestly, after hitting the $50K free from Braintree, PayPal is the cheapest I can find (since after $3K of volume transaction fees drop from 2.9% to 2.5%). No interchange plus model is worth it for my low volume, all keyed transactions, as visa is at 2.4%+ and Amex is 3.5%+. The best flat rates I can find are all at 2.9%.

Does anybody have recommendations for payment processors (other than PayPal or Bitcoin) which do provide seller protection for sale of digital goods?

Would you mind suggesting alternative payment processors other than Bitcoin which are suitable for sellers of online services or digital goods?

So it's quite obvious by the responses that if I were to do this, joining a mining consortium is the best route.  Is that even worth it?  How would this compare to, for example, one of the butterfly labs ASIC miners?
