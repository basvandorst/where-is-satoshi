This is awesome. Showing that bitcoins can be used for solving real world problems can help prove validity of crypto-currency. Keep it up guys.

Hopefully this is the casy, Vonney. The BFL miners were around that pricepoint not too long ago, but with their gained popularity I think they wanted to cash out. Still glad I bought one.

OP Here:
Fact of the matter is, I did invest the past month or so in attempting to understand BTC. Also, I do understand that BFL could very likely be a scam. What I didn't mind is taking the risk involved in spending $300 on a miner and having it not show up until months after promised. If this fails, at least I didn't invest a ridiculous amount of money to make a bad mistake...
My question was more tailored around what everyone thinks the network difficulty will end up at after this whole BFL craze is finally said and done. Right now there are too many points of view on the BFL debacle as a whole, so I guess understanding the difficulty has to be nearly impossible to guess. That being said, here is my pointless guess:
With the difficulty currently at 7,673,000 with a network hash rate of ~60Thash/s here are my speculations on difficulty after ASICMiner, AVALON, and BFL flood the network with power. We'll end up at about 1200Thash/s, which is about 19 times more efficient than today's number. Multiply our current difficulty by 19 to receive a projected difficulty of 145,787,000. Punch that into your calculator and smoke it.
I really just wanted people to talk about projections in this post rather than rant about the possible Ponzi that BFL is, however I won't tell you not to chuckle. I'm glad I got someone to laugh because of my ignorance.
If you guys ponder along with me, I'll wait to see my Jalapeno until June of next year :D

I'm wondering the same exact thing. Their site shows a much shorter miner, one that looks more like an Apple TV that is the 5GH/s miner.

I'm in the same boat as you Marcus. Just ordered mine this weekend, wasn't hopeful on seeing it any time soon. I don't really care if June isn't the projected ship date. I'm just excited to see the damn thing mine.

They've clearly stated on their site that if they are unable to deliver their product, then a refund will be issued. They did also preface this with the fact that they have no idea when the units will truly ship to their customers.
I think CardCounter has some validity in his post.

Massively relevant point.
