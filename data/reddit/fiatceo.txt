That's not true. 1 USD = 1 USD

Do you know what else you can do with paper? You can wipe tears with paper!

I would like to hire you for fiat consulting services (free of charge of course)
@_date: 2014-06-16 10:32:47
Why trust ghash.io when you can trust me instead?
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:52:18
Thank you for exposing me to your world. Now let me expose you to mine.
(P.S. :- Do I stuff the dollar bill in my USB socket now? Can a techie help me out here?)
@_date: 2014-06-16 12:40:16
I hope for your sake you honestly do believe that you are funny or witty
@_date: 2014-05-22 13:54:27
Speaking of which there is a lot of industrial demand for paper. Paper has a lot of intrinsic value. You can write on it, wrap your food in it, clean stuff with it, make bags to hold stuff in.
I think you guys are completely missing the intrinsic value of bits of paper with dead people on them.

Wow. Is this a real account? Can someone verify?
@_date: 2014-05-21 16:40:07
Fiat (since 1933) - Already reached a billion users
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:31:14
Oh no! We're sorry to see you go. Are you doing drugs? Are you a terrorist? Why do you want to leave our products?
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:11:05
No.... Come back to the bright side Edmund!
@_date: 2014-05-21 15:37:39
That's not true. I'm still here.
@_date: 2014-05-21 15:47:42
Thank you for pointing this out. This only affects users of ebay. Fiat money users are unaffected.
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:05:49
Haha. Loved that one.
100 bits

Hah! This is why you should use fiat. Oh wait...

Just post a message on your Twitter or blog with the Reddit username.

Why don't you dump all your BTC for my Fiat? I promise you that a dollar bill is a dollar bill and will always be a dollar bill. You must of course agree to be "moderated" by some of my agencies just as you will be moderated at but you will come to like it here.
Come over to my friend.

And so it begins :-

I know right? I don't understand why people always underestimate me

In other non news, most hotels in nyc now take fiat payments on a permanent basis
@_date: 2014-06-16 10:36:02
Fiat money! At least you can vote for a roomful of people who will then pretend to act in your best interests.
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:40:37
And that is why you don't invest your hard-earned wealth in a premined pump and dump like Ripple.
Come to I personally guarantee that nobody had mined any fiat currency before the public establishment of it. No premined scams here sir.
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:55:26
Of course! We all know what the most stable money in the world is!
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:54:40
-69$ for an overdraft fee
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:02:17
So too can fiat! You can get a stack of fiat notes and set them on fire! You can also easily control the amount of heat by controlling how much paper you throw in there.
You're really underestimating my products mate.
Caution :- do not place eggs directly in the fire's heat unless you like your chicks hard-boiled.
@_date: 2014-05-21 16:37:50
But... but... what will happen to my bits of paper if no-one has diarrhea anymore?
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:51:01
Excellent question. You can get fiat either as :-
1.) Payment for goods and services
2.) Exchange your bitcoins at a Fiat exchange like Bitstamp
3.) Get free fiat by becoming a close pal of mine and taking part in the mining process. Please go [here]
