What you're proposing is not realistic. For the blockchain to keep track of day to day transactions, iot transactions, financial record data, and who knows what else, 8,20, 100, 500mb is not enough.

Greek gov can print as many Drachmas as they want. They can't do that with bitcoin. You can't really compare the two that way. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:04:39


Yes! the Spanish and the Italian government officials are not Corrupt! Corrupt government officials is something that is unique to Greece!!!! derp derp derp


who is cheering for it?!?! We are simply pointing out the fact that we live in a house of cards! People are affected by it is NOT FUNNY! we are however using humor to point out to the other people (millions) living in Euro zone that be careful! Diversify! your money is not safe! 


The point is, that with bitcoin, all you need is an app on your phone and you can hit the ground running! It's too late for Greece! they can't even pull their money out! But, lets say italians took out 20% of their money and bought btc! If suddenly they find themselves in the same situation, at least they have something that they can use to trade for goods and services! 
stop being a douche!

You are simply wrong. You haven't need to Greece have you ? There are a lot of family owned shops. They can start accepting btc just by simply deciding its time. No permission is  needed. That way people can at least buy food and shelter from one another.

Adam is so right. Gavin's behavior is starting look fishy to me. The lightning network has promis and if successful, it  can allow us ALL to be able to run a full node. Why not wait? They are trying to control the network. We need to be very careful and thoughtful about our next few moves.  We can literally lose the network to the same greedy corporations satoshi was trying to bypass. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:01:23
Okay then. If you still don't understand why Bitcoin is better than paper fiat, then I have nothing to tell you.
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:06:08
In my opinion, Gavin and Mike are working with big business. Does it matter what you call the Corp ? Who cares. The ones that can afford to have datacenters. Big business. You know... Wall street type companies. Those guys !  Are you awake ?

I call BS on that! even with the so called stress test, nothing happened! Jesus Christ! will you people ease up already! A lot of people don't want this increase right now! and you know what? If what you said about :


Then people would be outraged  and everyone would know we have to do something! The fact that you people come here with hypotheticals means that the SKY IS NOT FALLING!!! it reminds me of all the weapons of mass destruction arguments!! 
*" see this vile... saddam has million tons of it .. hidden in his underground fortress!" *
lel.. seriously bro.. give it a rest. 


 
Again... BS  sudden forks when the situation calls for it is actually the safest way to go! you know why game theory non-expert?!!!1  because then EVERYONE would be on-board! and the risk of a split-network would be greatly decreased! You can get everyone on-board in very quick time! We don't need to use horses and pigeons to communicate! In case there was an ACTUAL problem, then the overwhelming majority would get on board the new chain! and you wouldn't have to beg them like a panhandler and because it would make FUCKING sense!  Also, a fast hard fork has happened already and everything went just fine! and that was before the community was this strong!

he can't spend them anyway! people are watching those coins like a hawk and if they start to move, who knows what will happen to the price. People are not comfortable to know some guy owns 1 millions coins!  They are just hoping the keys are lost! 
If he made this into a public event, where he said on P2P forum using his account that he is going to move them and they work with Yanis, Andreas to somehow distrobute those coins to the people/familes (PROVABLE this time! none of that .. oh.. we'll give 7% to the charity the rest in some fat cats pocket) It would be the most amazing thing in bitcoin history imo.

Pretty much right. 
Miners are looking for a hash of a block that start with x amount of zeros and the only way to get it, is by changing the input (block +a random number ) when they get that they will broadcast it out and if it becomes the next block they get the blockreward / coinbase of 25 btc and it becomes spendable after 100 blocks have passed

Those investors are most likely invested in bitcoin in general, so the 21 million is to help scale  this project  which their other investments are dependent on. Pretty simple really! 


HODL THE FUCKING PHONE!! WHAT!??!?!!?!?!? How dare they?
Again, hoping to make some money on your projects is not something that tells me they are crooks! which whats this engineered narrative seems to say. 
Open-sourcing their project and encouraging people to fork their project or join to help however, tells me where their heart is at!

One bitcoin is enough if you divide it enough. just add one zero. remember, adding another dec place will enrich EVERYONE who has coins instead of QE which comes from the FED to the Banks to the smaller banks to maybe you.

[Like this post](
What this genius fails to understand, is that this is not a patent! or a closed source tech! This is an open source project.  They are genuinely trying to fix this issue w/o having to have to increase the block size every few years and did i mention ?? it's open source on fucking git.

miners and people who are running full nodes will decide. This WILL cause a fork, the question is, how bad of a fork! 50 50?  60 40? 90 10?  One thing is clear, with this little consensus, there will be pandemonium.

"Two wrongs don't make it right but it damn sure make us even"


It's not about escalating the conflict! Its about I'm sick and tired of coming here to read all these Gavin praising and blockstream hate to the point where, again, it makes it look like an engineered narrative. The other day, I was reading all of this hate comments about Adam! Come on guys! this whole thing was built on top of his hash-cash idea! I mean FFS, he could be one of the original member of "satoshi" (whom ever they are) for all we know.  Is this like buying all those "likes" on facebook? Can you buy "hate"? Who knows!?

@_date: 2015-07-22 18:05:58
I don't think that they will simply co-exist! I think they need each other, and actually they are complementary to each other, like I said earlier. 
Ethereum doesn't really have it's own "currency" per se. It's gas! It's literally called gas! Gas (ether) is used to run DAO/DAPs.  You're not going to use ether to buy cookies in real world. You are not going to use ether to buy a watch or pay for rent. Gas will be used to run decentralized applications on the ethereum blockchain. People will use bitcoin to buy gas so they can use/run DAPs.  If you want to use a decentralized reddit or facebook or Insurance or whatever, You will only be able to use Gas and the only way to get gas is most likely with other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  In my opinion, when ethereum (frontier) actually launches and DAPs start to take off, that's when you'll see the real use for bitcoin.  
Does that make sense?

No! What I'm saying is that there seems to be an engineered narrative here which says "These blockstream guys are blocking the size increase because they want to make money off of their technology" but what they fail to mention is that this is an open source project! anyone can learn and consult with their knowledge in payment channels, and hell, they can even stick a fork in it if they wanted to!

again! there is NO formal education in the topic of conspiracies! What the fuck is wrong with you?? I'm an engineer. Do you know what engineers love the most? Logic! You don't need to be an "expert" in politics to understand that Politicians LIE! That's their fucking J.O.B! So, as an engineer, I use my logic and determine could they be lying? If so, why? Unlike you people who fucking read op-eds by numb-skulls like Paul Krugman and eat it up like a fat kid eating hohos without asking a single question. If you get a "formal education" on economy, that basically means you have been fully brain-washed into the current broken system, because if you asked too many questions about the fuckary involved, you would have flunked out a while ago. Formal eduction teaches you not to question authority and regurgitate what you've been told like a good monkey!

What do you call the treatment that guys like Peter Todd or Adam Back are getting from the Gavinites? You don't see that as disrespect? 
Again, what the current narrative seems to suggest is that "zomg.. blockstream .. EVIL CORP.. they wanna stop bitcoin's growth so they can make money!"  which is absurd!
