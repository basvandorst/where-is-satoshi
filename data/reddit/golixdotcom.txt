bitcoin is changing a lot, especial in terms of improving financial autonomy, which no doubt is still a struggle in Africa. It's just a matter of time before African countries fully harness BTC to improve financial circulation

This is one of the crucial part about bitcoin that many people are still grappling to understand. Confusing BTC for a ponzi scheme is not doing cryptocurrencies any favour, hence it should be noted that detailed articles like this, can give better insight to many who still believe that BTC is a Ponzi Scheme

Lol You've gotta love Dragon Ball Z! 
It's over 9k, it back under - we're stuck with this Yoyo every few cycles. When will it end?
Judging from the rebounding BTC et al prices everyone in the cryptos trader (and HODLer?) 'verse is chuffed with the G20 outcome- which essentilly kept this going. 
That's all good, but sooner or later this issue has to be addressed. 
One could argue its a necessary stage of cryptos evolution.

In ZImbabwe it's a possibilty. We have a colourful history with an out-of-whack currency that led to the adoption of a "multi-currency basket". It's still in use, with the USD in the lead, but forex is still a nightmare, and cryptos are pulling some weight in terms of cross border payments.
If Liechtenstein works out (work out is relative tbh) it could start the discussion and you might get an ether-based token trading in one or two banks with the central bank's go ahead. 
NB ZImbabwe is also a small country (sub 15m population - emerging economy, in Africa etc) so its hard to not be drawn to the idea of it also happening here ;-)

Yes that's true. For us Cryptocurrencies present a bigger opportunity than just getting rich quick in Africa. We (golix.com) are the first cryptocurrency exchange in  and have realised (backed by stats of course) that a significant portion of our clients use the platform for things like remittances, international payments and so forth rather than just to hodl etc. Our aim is to afford people in Africa financial autonomy and cryptos seem to be the answer

Yea we definitely can't rule out the fact that some were trading to get rich fast

Interesting right there... now just thinking; does the rate of adoption reflect on the greatness of the product or it's reflective of how humans have evolved in terms of being quick(er) to find value in innovation and/or inventions
