You can't be seriously saying that taxes are what separate us from chaos.
"E*veryone would have to pay for their children's education privately*"
What's the problem? Don't you pay for your internet **privately**? Don't you pay for your clothes bought from a **private** store? The difference is that you're forced to pay for, following you line of thought, schools even you do not have kids. If it were not for taxes, who would pay for the weapons sent to the arabs kill themselves with? Who would pay for the airstrikes in Syria? 
*"People would die of starvation and exposure to the elements regularly"*
Really? How do you know that? So before welfare, corpses were piled on the streets and we had to walk with gas masks? Sorry to pop your bubble, but in Brazil, which got some of the highest taxes of South America, more than 65k people were violently killed due crime. Just yesterday, our national museum burned down because the fire fighters didn't have had **water**, yes, **water**. They basically just stood there and watched. We got *free* healthcare, but is doesn't work. We got *free* education, but it also doesn't work. We are just beign robbed by the gov. to sustain a system bound to fail.
So, if do not live in a country like this, it is rather difficult for you to understand why libertarians say that taxation is theft.

I agree, I don't think this is a breakout leading to an uptrend yet. There's more space for a bigger retracement for around 5k.
