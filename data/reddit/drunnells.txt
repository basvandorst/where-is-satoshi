Con - Can't withdraw to Bech32 / bc1 addresses. I'd like to purchase on Cash App and then send to Bitcoin Lightning Wallet for spending via Lightning, but receive address is bc1 only. Also con - No Lightning in Cash App.

This worked on Gboard for Android as well!: settings-&gt;dictionary-&gt;personal dictionary
I had been disappointed since Feb that iOS Gboard had the symbol, but Android did not! ₿!

I personally would love for Bitpay to work. No hate here. BUT saying that there is no possible way for Bitpay to not work is just false. Consider this experience:
I am in the US, so I purchase some Bitcoin from Coinbase. Ready to make a transaction, right? I go to a vendor that has a Bitpay checkout thinking that I can pay with my Bitcoin. Nope! 
Ok, no problem, I'll transfer some to my Ledger and spend from there - Nope, no hardware wallets work with it!
Ok, I have been using a Lightning/Bitcoin wallet too, I'll just use that - Nope! No Payment Protocol support built in! 
I gave this transaction more than enough chances, I'm not installing a specific wallet just for this one purchase. What I found that was easier than dealing with Bitpay was just not using Bitpay at all. I just want to spend my BTC, I don't care about the payment provider.

Hey, thanks!!

Recently had a similar issue on ledger.com. Took me a while to realize that my wallet wasn't even compatible with Bitpay's Payment Protocol. Today I made a purchase with a vendor that was using Coinbase Commerce, which worked as expected with a normal payment address, but involved waiting 10 minutes for a confirmation. As a Bitcoin enthusiast, I'm looking forward to these problems getting solved and having a smooth transaction experience! It feels like Lightning might be the fix, but just isn't quite there yet.

Thanks in advance for the tip!
If anyone is interested, I am able to receive the tip without running a node with the Bitcoin Lighting Wallet:
Seems to work great, as long as you have enough room in your channel! I opened a channel and then made room with Lightning Conductor:
