Would someone be able to explain to me why the actions of bitcoin core developers even matter? I mean, can't we just use some other software instead? Please explain.

I've been out of the loop with the crypto community for a while, but I've recently been made aware that there are a bunch of people who think that bitcoin shouldn't be used for transactions, and instead it's only a "store of value".
Sorry but this is some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard. Bitcoin doesn't have value unless it's used for transactions, that's what it's useful for. Where do you think the value actually comes from? Does it come from hype? That's called a bubble.
I think this kind of thinking is due to the hodl meme. I'm sorry to break this to you, but the only people who are now rich due to bitcoin investment are people who adopted it back in 2009-2011 (usually to buy drugs from Silk Road). You're like a decade late to the party, this isn't a get rich quick scheme. Crypto has a bright future, but that future is going to be in newer coins. Satoshi's white paper was revolutionary, but the technology has progressed greatly since then. 
Also, you don't know how to invest if you think that holding on to any particular asset while the price drops is a good idea.
I had to get that off my chest. Downvote me if you want.

I just wrote software to trade bitcoin for me (it's only like 500 lines of poorly written code, nothing fancy or anything). It's infinitely better than hodling, but if you're going to do it, make sure you actually know how to trade first, too many people just get into it with no idea of what they're doing. Spend like a year or so trading stocks first and you'll be good.

This isn't a zero-sum game. When bitcoin pumps, a lot of altcoins pump too. But shitcoins pump because people are dumbasses.

Why hodl? Why not sell now and buy the dip later when the crash ends?

Ignoring the fact that Microsoft and Facebook are the worst when it comes to privacy, I'm happy that these big companies are adopting bitcoin and blockchain technology. This might be the initial push that's needed for mainstream adoption.
