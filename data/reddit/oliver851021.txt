Bitcoin buyers get freshly printed Tether borrowed, buy quite a bunch of bitcoin and thus make the price spike because of the tiny market, wait a bit for FOMO to raise the price even more, then sell the bitcoin at considerably higher price, pay the Tether printers and keep the profit. Bitcoin price is tanking. Wait some time. Rinse and repeat. 
Thin-air-Tether, backed by nothing, easily gives you the liquidity to manipulate the price as described. If you would have to do this with real dollars, you would need a serious 7-digit loan from a real bank, for some reason the bank would want to have securities and interest. Much easier to do it with play money.

I think your thoughts are heavily biased by the shitty American banking and payments systems.
Imagine a young person in Germany starting their first job with a company and getting paid their salary. The young one opens up a bank account without a fee and will get a debit card for free. Now after the employer would wire transfer the net income after deducting insurance and taxes, there is some money on this account. The guy has installed automatic payment of his rent by wire transfer and has accepted automatic deduction for phone and electricity by direct debit. Going shopping, they would pay with the debit card (no interest rate) or would first go to an ATM to get some cash (no fee). Moreover, they can get a cheap or free credit card and they can agree to pay 100 percent of the bill the next month (no interest rate), so they can easily buy things in the internet and even open up a PayPal account. Since they are still young, the bank account might be almost empty when the next salary would arrive one month later, by wire transfer. Of course our intelligent young person is aware that the credit card bill of the last month will hit their account in the middle of the month, and will consider this as well.
There's no debts, there's no fees, there's no interest rates. Everything they do is their decision. The 1.x percent inflation rate wouldn't matter because the salary is going to rise next year and the money is turned over within the one month. And everything is heavily protected by the banks and the law. 
Why should they use crypto, except for the adventure of the new experience?

@_date: 2019-07-14 10:04:26
The kind of trading you're talking about won't push the price up, as you can see looking at the currencies. You're making a lot of assumptions and hope all of them are going to work, but you forget that there's no central banks stabilizing bitcoin. Even USD and EUR which have a market cap in the trillions sometimes need stabilization measures, whereas the small unregulated bitcoin will remain to be swinging with unpredictable volatility and most market participants will lose money, as they do in the Forex market anyway. No way this will help the average Joe to use bitcoin on a daily basis. Actually it's gambling, not investing.

The money is the hard earned money from all the people who believe that "number will go up". Unlike houses (which pay rent) or stocks (which pay dividends) or bonds (which pay interests) the bitcoins are just there, passively, representing nothing in real life, and they have exactly the value which the next buyer is willing to pay at the moment you're going to sell. So "hodling" and DCA'ing bitcoin means that you spend your money of today (your money is gone) and you keep up the hope that after a long time, everything with the bitcoin ecosystem is still fine and you can sell it for more money than you paid plus the money you could have earned with one of the methods above for instance. Which went well for the early adopters who started at a few dollars and sold for close to 20k.

You're totally missing the point that wages from today are 25 to 30 times higher than in 1930 as well. I agree that it confirms the inflationary nature of money, but it disproves your claim to be robbed all the time. Whereas only rich people could afford one car at that time, today most families have two much better cars, and in addition they have a fridge and a TV and computers and several smartphones and ebikes and cameras and a lot of other gadgets which would have been unaffordable then because after buying the food and paying the bills, no money was left over. Today average people have still money to travel during a PTO. Average people are much richer today than they were in 1930.

You're right, to be a game changer you actually need to change something which people perceive as a benefit. The most recent game changer in the payment world was PayPal, because they added trust to online payments, so merchants and buyers couldn't trust each other but both trusted PayPal - and the money paid was instantaneously "transferred" i. e. credited to the merchant's account so that they could ship the goods immediately.
So PayPal added trust and speed to the online retail business, while most crypto is slow and trustless. And very complicated and very risky. Sooo...

The big risk for bitcoin is that there might be too many people who have to stop their DCA'ing when there's no free money, and too many people who need their bitcoins back to pay their bills.

There were times when inflation was around 2 percent *and* you could get 3 percent interest for your savings account (at least in my country, don't know how it was in the US).

I'm quite sure that the psychological effect is considerable. However most people overlook that the halvening is already being discussed for a while, so all the FOMO has started to be included into the current price. This anticipation effect will get stronger during the next months, and it might well happen that the price is climbing until the halvening to further compensate the growing FOMO. But at the very day of the event, there's not much more to be seen (because it has been anticipated long time before), and the missing spike at the day of the event will cause disappointment and a consecutive price drop.

Your point about mass adoption and utility is the crucial one. If everyone is going to use Libra, because it's no hassle and accepted everywhere, bitcoin and other crypto might run into an acceptance issue.
However all over Europe, some officials have reacted to the white paper and said there are legal issues. I'm not into all of the details, but for sure offering financial services is heavily regulated in every single country, let alone creating currencies..

If you look at the historical charts, there's not much to comfort you. The issue is that internet and bots can intensify each market sentiment exponentially. After it will hit 10k, some sell orders are triggered, will push the price below 10k again and then everything is at stake, and the bull vs bear bet is running again. If the trading bots get nervous you might have an avalanche of sell orders crashing the price down in a few hours. If they are outnumbered by the buy orders, the price will come up again and even go higher. The small market and the gambling attitude are amplifying all movements in a somewhat crazy style. So far, the bulls have countered the drops successfully..

There's surely a lot of potential in this direction, and I also agree that it's the two billion user base which makes the pivotal difference. And of course the huge financial power FB can move to get such a new big thing started. I don't see it as an existential threat to currencies if the backing is properly kept up, since the Dollars or Euros or whatever have to be exchanged into Libra in the first place. FB or its Libra consortium will require a banking license of course, but it shouldn't be a big deal for them to get one.
@_date: 2019-06-21 10:38:29
I don't think it would be a big issue when we restrict the Libra model to the US and to the dollar. In this case, it wouldn't be anything else than a stable coin, and as far as I have understood your taxation rules, it wouldn't even be a taxable event because of no gains. So I'm quite sure they could just run such a model with no legal issues, legally it shouldn't be so different from a gift card except that they promise stronger backing for the coin.
It's getting complicated with a) cross-border transactions, and b) backing it by a whole basket of domestic and foreign currency, thus determining an own fluctuating price against each currency. Both of it will cause a lot of headache on the side of FB and of all responsible authorities in each country.

That the US are still using checks at all is ridiculous. Europe abandoned checks 15 years ago, it's really obsolete. Tax authorities here will just do a wire transfer to your account if you get money back.

The texts read, "my money is gone", "donate generously" and "the high price of bitcoin" so I would hope there's some insight into reality. Will be super interesting anyway!

You're right, until now they didn't say that they would do fractional reserve, unlike Tether who finally admitted it by silently changing their TOS. As long as one "Libra" keeps up its initial backing as outlined by them prior to the launch, it's not money printing.

It might seriously jeopardize the current crypto market, because it will offer a lot of easy-to-use global services with their coin, maybe even free of charge. The perception of people will be that it's convenient and useful, and that's all what it needs to get mass adoption started..

November 2020 - down to 87 USD is more pessimistic than I thought, but let's see whether they are right.

I was ranting about the US as a whole, I'm fully aware that people can't do a lot about it. Looking at Amazon and Apple Pay, checks are like stone age nostalgia. Here in Germany basically all is done with wire transfers, that's why credit cards aren't that common either.

It's insane that BSV quadrupled upon the copyright thing end of May, and didn't drop back since then. Amazing crypto space - solely moved by emotions.

LN doesn't work either, you know it. Network topology, vulnerability (watchtowers..) and most of all, the required prefunding of channels, are the show stoppers. This is the imminent problem of bitcoin the pioneer crypto currency, it doesn't scale.

It might not crash the ecosystem for technical reasons, it's only that *other miners* wouldn't be able to earn money any more. Everything else would still work. Agreed that people would possibly have psychological issues with the divine number guessing - but we are in a hypothetical scenario anyway.

I'm wondering why people would still want to listen to the "experts", after all of them miserably failed to predict something close to the truth for 2017 and 2018. Any reason why they could be closer in 2019?

Maybe they would try in the first place, but you know that bitcoin cannot cope with all payments of a country of 31m people.

Only cash - no checks, Germany has still almost 50 percent of payments in cash. And the credit cards aren't liked so much because of their high fees, but the debit cards linked to everyone's bank account are widely accepted and have less fees for the merchant.

The article is really well written and important. Silently, with internet, we went back to a "low-trust society" which is as bad as it sounds..

Between zero and 1k, only the long-term holders are still playing around with it. FB coin, Apple coin, China coin have taken over. 1 Dollar has the value of 85 cents of today's dollar. Be realistic. 
Except, we're going to have another big recession, if the debt bubble would burst. Then it's going to be worse and unpredictable.

Everybody is bitching about the Euro but the fact is that it has become the second reserve currency of the world. The only currency which is almost at eye level with the dollar. None of the national currencies could have done that, not even our beloved Deutsche Mark.
