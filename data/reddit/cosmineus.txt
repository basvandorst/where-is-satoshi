The graphs are starting to look like my grandfather's wood saw. Come on bitcoin, do something.
Btw. Where are we in the btc timeline? I mean if you buy like 1000$ worth of btc now, there's no chance you're a "whale" to the one buying btc 5-6 years from now. But in dinosaurs to present day timeline are we seeing keops, jesus or 2pac?

That is what i was asking. The 24 private key words are the key to the ledger or to your account/private keys? Because from the online reviews i understand that you can restore your keys into any new ledger and access your funds. That means, i think, you can resset it and the device will give you your own 24 words for a new clean setup. Am i getting this wrong?

Dude. Correct me if i'm wrong. A whale is another dude with a bunch of bitcoin. Big bunch. So isnt't in that whale interest that the price go up so one lambo tuns into 5? What's the ideea? If someone sells 20000 btc the price goes down by 2k and then buy again to benefit from that?

Thank you. Cost isn't a real factor given that we're into crypto, but i'd rather spend 200$ on btc in a paper wallet instead of a overpriced 70$ hw wallet. I'd rather ask a friend to buy and bring one on his vacantion abroad. Or look into archos safe t. At 50$ is a steal. Later edit: it's actually 410 usd for a ledger nano s
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:54:14
The first time i read about bitcoin was in 2013 at about 300$ usd. I said " it's not going to catch". Then at 600$ i said "it's over. It has no future". At 6000$ i said "what a bubble. Someone is going to get hurt". At 18000$ i said " shit, i'm missing the train, i'm in!" Now i really want it as low as it can get just to buy even if i'm WAY below the line
@_date: 2018-10-20 13:54:24
I heard about the risk. Just asking if you can reset it to factory settings. Like i replied to a fellow redditor right now in my country a ledger nano s is 410usd. Would you buy it? That's alot of satoshis on a free paoer wallet. Edit: just checked. now is on sale but still over 200$

Romania. Biggest online store sells  (emag.ro) it at 1666 in our currency (Ron). Given that 1$ is 4Ron that means 410$. would you buy it?
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:54:18
Shhhh bitcoin is doing something!
@_date: 2018-10-20 09:12:14
Apparently in my country a ledger nano s is about 200$ (way off from official site) and some sellers have it for ~70.

My first ,the biggest, buy was at almoust ath. Since then i bought 3 more times in the mid 6k's and i actually need it to be 11k to break even. No worries. You only lose if you sell. If nothing bad happens i don't need that money. Feeling allmoust confident.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:50:04
Yey. Only 12k to go till break even

Yea. Coolwallet does not have that. Would be nice
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:29:58
Stfu. Where did you get that from? As long as the energy cost of mining 1 btc is on average 6000$, wright now btc is underevaluated. Support for what? From whom? 
Just buy and relax or forget about it for 2 years

@_date: 2018-11-19 16:51:54
I believe you guys should just shut up. I didn't get in for the tech either but you should have known better that cryptos are hugely fragile. What goes up must go down and the harder you fell the more you rise. There is only one way to lose in crypto: IF YOU SELL. The days of fast money are in the past. If you have the balls buy now and forget about it for 2 years if not, just sell and leave us alone!

I'd like to present you with a notion called black friday. Were you sleeping? Bought coolwallet s at -40%.

At least bitcoin is doing something!
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:36:12
It prompts you on the card itself the ammount going out and the full adress of the recipient so you can verify it with the app. 
After you check the adress you validate with your fingerprint
Btw why would you need a pin code when you have fingerprint sensor. It cannot be forgotten and it's unique. I use fingerprint sensor on my phone to validate mastercard transactions for years. 
I don't work for coolbitx neither had i owned a ledger/trezor but an least it's ubercool and cannot be tampered with. I mean good luck if you can insert any chip in that thing like we seen on ledger/trezor

As i said before in this thread: Coolwallet S is a mobile only hardware wallet. You sign via 2FA ( fingerprint scanner on your phone and button on your card). It is tamper proof, bendable, exactly credit card size. I love it!

Please enlighten me. What do you mean by "passphrase support" ? 
It's the seed used to recover lost wallet?
@_date: 2019-01-10 09:14:58
You have good odds that this bitcoin thing will work out but then the greed kicks in. You'll postpone your cashout hoping it will rise further. again and again because it's never enough. Suddenly it drops 90% because bitcoin tends to do that sometimes. 
Later edit: Just don't hold it in exchange
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:31:01
Question please: i read an article (forgot source) that pointed that the mining cost of 1 btc is on average 5500$ (depending on country) taking in account am S9 hardware. Isn't this like a stretched rubber band? It cannot sustain current levels. It either crash or rise above the cost of production, because miners have no interest, wright?
@_date: 2019-01-04 13:35:07
I have to disagree. As i remember, when i first setup my wallet, the app promted me to ask if the seed should be delivered by app or by CARD. I clearly remember choosing by app because i was kinda lasy
Later edit: wanderig how "encripted" the bluetooth thing is tho. 
I charge the device once every 2 weeks and not because the battery is depleted but because coolbitx recomends so. 
This wallet suits me best because my gaming era is long gone and my computer is NAS only via xpenology for streaming and havent opened the laptop since july.

Thanx a lot. After your reply i started searching and today it has arrived. It's wonderfull. Exactly the size and thickness of a credit card. Used mycellium to sweep my paper wallet. Worked like a charm. Still 0 cornfirmations after 2 hrs tho.
You should really consider it. The fact that you can only use your phone is a wonder. Now researching what are the diferences between wallets that starts with 3 (has it by default). Only had wallets that started with 1
Edit: ordered on black friday for 60usd. With customs tax and other dhl tax it was about 95 usd.

You'd better get that btc back pronto because in a few month it will worth peanuts :)))
Serious, now. Why tf would you keep btc in exchanges? Hardly seen any mtgox victims screaming their butts of on reddit. Most of them had taken bigger loses. NOT YOR KEYS, NOT...ohhh wtf
What good can your constant reddit spam can do? Cases like yours are as frequent as plane crashes (given that day to day volume of transaction) wich leads me to believe they're on to something and you're a fraud. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:54:20
Don't let them get to you. Next time just say "I bought bitcoin" and they'll welcome you to the family :)
