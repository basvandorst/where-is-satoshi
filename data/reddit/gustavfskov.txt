and what are the chances that you are going to give it back and not file for bankruptcy instead?

AFAIK, all cryptos but BTC are safe. Zane mentioned this many times before as well. The hack was limited to BTC only, from what I read..

in terms of seeing our money ever again. FUCK.

a ROUGH estimation of the BTC amount that has already been considered "lost" up to this moment? Or in percentage of the total BTC amount kept on BFX?

this is SO fucking dumb. SO.fucking.DUMB. who on EARTH advised this?!?! exposing an internet-enabled node to a fucking internet-enabled 3rd party to store your customer's funds, instead of just a hot wallet? really? omg.

Zane, in all honesty, do you really think this is going to go any other way but filling for bankruptcy / Gox scenario? I'm not being sarcastic or cynical, but would you REALLY have the resources to make ends meet with such a tremendous loss?

why did Bitfinex choose segregated wallets to store their users` funds, instead of the cold/hot wallet setup? Doesn't it mean that when a node is hacked that relays requests to BitGo, then the criminal can disburse all funds from all wallets? Contrary to when the funds are kept in an online hot wallet and the main amount in cold storage (offline). What am I missing?

money laundering?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:16:24
i'm starting to think that too.. Bitfinex, with all their money, security advisors, auditors.. and falling for this shit - speechless..

if your customer had an account balance in fiat - are you expected to cover it, like other cryptos but BTC or your will "share" the losses between all users equally? I.e., if you were a draw a decision regarding on how you'd cover for the losses at this very stage - would you reimburse all the unaffected users (if the user had fiat, then pay him in fiat, if the user had LTC - give him his LTCs back etc) and try to compensate the clients that lost BTC over some time instead.. or they will be no such "selective" action?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:59:13
pfft. come on. that's it? I'm looking at the losses 10 times of that and I can tell you that I really can't share the same positive outlook, because I most likely understand what 120K BTC losses are going to deliver to the table

why was this setup preferred over the hot/cold wallet configuration - it means that one of your servers gets hacked (the one that communicates with BitGo) and then it's possible for the offending party to initiate requests that disburse coins from wallets stored by a 3rd party (even though securely).. this means you can lose ALL user coins, while cold storage would have had been kept offline.. what gives?!
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:52:41
how much you lost?
