market cap of Dotcom bubble reached a max of ~7.5T 
market cap of cryptocurrency now ~0.5T
Take into account the copious amounts of Quantitative Easing that has occurred after the Dot com bust plus the financial crash of 2008/09.
We're only at tipping point this year. This is the year of defining utility for a lot of coins. Many will win but a whole lot more will lose.

It really bothers me that any site on the web is centralized to an extent which really bothers me and questions transparency on behalf of owners of CMC and other similar sites...I think we need both decentralized exchanges and decentralized web URGENTLY!!! Time is really running out. As more and more exchanges become clogged with new sign ups and slow broadcasting transactions, the more FUD we'll see from new investors. 
1. We need ease of access and improved UI for the layman.
2. We need more zero knowledge proof platforms and increased privacy. Or else hire more staff and get better servers to handle all the requests.
3. Atomic swaps need to come into play. 
4. LN and other 2nd Layer solutions need to be continuously tested and adopted.
5. SegWit urgently needs to be deployed. It is ready to go.

Noob sentiment:
1. "It only went up 50-100 dollars, BTC is going nowhere."  
2. "BTC drops 50-100 dollars. OMG it's dropping, it's going to crash. I'm selling."

A bullrun is due soon, judging by TA. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:57:22
Adoption rates are still very low so the market is still going to look bullish overall this year maybe not as potent as 2017
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:16:19
Wait til Late Feb, that's when the party resumes.

neither is it going below 10k
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:14:10
That was because of Asian FUD. Look at all last year majority of weekends particularly on Sundays were low on volume. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:22:36
They're busy implementing LN, Lambo supercharged..I mean Teslas
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:40:57
funnily enough I heard it through a ponzi scheme called OneCoin back in 2015. Started learning about Blockchain and then invested about 2k Euro in BTC at the end of 2016. I'm at 22k euro but I forked my earnings into some alts as well.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:29:22
They knew this would impact the market they're not stupid. Ffs
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:03:55
News probably not reaching enough people yet and futures are still in play til the 26th
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:14:11
Why do people think Futures stopping on the 26th is necessarily a bad thing? It means no more manipulation for a bit. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:58:15
it's better if some coin with greater utility takes over because Bitcoin is all speculation at this point in time
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:41:23
Thought that was the goal of NEXUS?
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:13:34
It's time to start a physical revolution. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:55:07
Because inflation continues on and on and purchasing power of Fiat dwindles.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:38:43
Give it til the 26th until CME futures expire. If we stay above 10k. Then we could go on a small run. The real test is if it stays above that til the end of Feb. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:16:37
Asians won't trade much til after Lunar New Year, today was the day Koreans were supposed to come back into the market but no volume tells a different tale

So it's all about Tether FUD

I think the Pfizer route is more likely with LN and Segwit adoption.

Does the Intel bug have an effect on Cryptos in any way?

 just Google it ffs
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:03:18
It has hit 10k support many times already. Look at the charts we've hit a higher low at every dip in this triangle pattern.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:29:38
I'm guessing this is the 5th Elliott wave down and then we're back up?

No one gives a flying shite, never invest what you can't afford to lose. The onus is on them. Not us.

What I meant to say is it's like previous dips
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:42:47
Volume is super low
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:05:42
you've answered your own question lol

 OLD NEWS MOVE ON
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:11:57
Nope, transparency and immutability are very important factors in an economic sense. Imagine the amount of money saved in risk management, supply chain and logistics by using cryptography and a consensual distributed ledger system that self regulates. It eliminates a lot of human interaction but not necessarily completely. Billions would be saved. Blockchain is purely mathematical.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:19:27
This is just a theory but what if the current FUD is to shake out weak hands so the guys on wall street, big bankers and financial institutions across the globe start pumping the market next week when they get their fat bonus??
Thoughts? This manipulation is becoming a lot more frequent. Media spreading FUD to cause mass hysteria and then week later starts creating FOMO. ELite are accumulating?
NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:38:18
Because of the Utility of some coins and Bitcoin as a store of value. Other shitcoins will not last and a lot of that value will flow back into Bitcoin or Ethereum.

"South Korean Banks Drop Crypto Accounts as Government Plans a Ban" - Bitcoin.com
Is it true or just FUD?
What worries me is alot of the volume comes from Korea too
Any guesses?

Wow BTC is going through some frenzy today!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:10:22
Also what is astonishing is 11B 24hr volume!!! And that is still minuscule compared to FOREX which is like 5.5T plus daily 
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:09:05
I think this is the end for Bitcoin and alts

looks like we're forming a handle
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:59:36
Mainstream media outlets need to be put under scrutiny and put under all sorts of pressure. This cannot continue. How long more is it going to take even the most blind and unaware to realise it's all elite propaganda. Something has got to give even outside the scope of Bitcoin!

There seems to be a global orchestrated attack on decentralisation. Do not give up. We need to out number these evil bureaucrats making all the decisions that keep suppressing our freedom. With all these bans and fake news etc there has to be a backlash
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:58:24
I think there's no point of hodling, just accumulate more and more but low sell high
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:44:22
Just remember that the underlying technology and other DLT projects are only beginning to develop their ideas and strategies for the future. It takes years and years of testing to get best quality out of your project. The only reason why it's so speculative now is because we now have the internet at our exposure and can gather info much faster than we could in the 90's during the dot.com phase. Plus people want to get rich quick. 
The best projects will give the best opportunity to investors and many will die too. Projects that can scale and save economies Billions will thrive. I also think when the general public start to USE the technology, we might see another bubble and then stability. 
The best option is to accumulate and not sell and stay out unless you've made a decent profit. If you sell at a loss and don't come back in then that's a hefty fine you have to pay.
