Then you don't take the job...$500 is great for someone new looking to build a Portfolio that they can show employers to get a higher paying job or even a expert looking to make pocket money...most people make 500 a week in the US anyway especially where I live...don't crap on the guy he is apparently paying what he can afford and if it's in crypto it's a great addition to a investment...

Yes in the states and I attempted multiple times back in NOV and this month as well to no success

Ignore the A holes above.. blockfolio is great..would be better if they let you account for fees
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:33:33
Pay your phone bill
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:29:20
Blockfolio just needs a way to account for fees when transferring buying and selling and it will be 9/10

I've been buying and selling for months on CB since BTC was 7k verified and all but even then GDAX could not find my public record despite accepting my ID for coinbase...so you are incorrect...GDAX is off limits to lots of people because of this issue..and I believe it's intentional

So can I purchase tether straight off bittrex using a wire transfer or debit card? Enlighten me what is tether ...I'm fed up with not being able to verify on GDAX due to it not accepting ID and I want a way to have USD funds available for buy orders cause I always miss the dips due to Coinbase slowness
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:40:53
I started at 7k and have only 2k in cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:29:03
Bought more
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:34:04
No it doesn't been verified on coinbase for months at this point still can't get verified on GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:25:41
I have some good amount of ADA im wondering if I put all in cause I'm here for gains in $$$
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:33:12

I was able to purchase 99USD BTC at 9300 surprise ingly on coin base ...but they limit me to 99USD A week
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:29:02
So if I had a buy order with that had been a gaurentee of it going through?
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:49:24
I am now then proud owner of $120 worth of Bit coin...I took the plunge
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:29:47
I don't even know what segwit 2x means I got on the Bitcoin bandwagon 2 weeks ago
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:18:00
I know it's volatile but I love how you see growth
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:49:51
Is that a free program
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:06:31
Get a gemini exchange account at least deposit $100 Usd at a time to use in buy orders
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:23:07
This actually happened?
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:51:36
