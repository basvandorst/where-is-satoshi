Basic translation for those who are curious.....  quick intro into what bitcoin is.  then a short segment of a coffee shop that received it's first bitcoin payment from an american student in beijing. quick interview with the american student. then closed out with some of the strengths and weaknesses of bitcoin.

There simply isn't enough people who would be willing to boycott apple, especially just for that.  
I think a better solution is just continuing to work with the bitcion community to continue to bring it more mainstream and get wider attention.  Eventually if bitcoin became popular enough I'm sure apple would start allowing bitcoin related apps.

Luckily 2,000 euros isn't the end of the world.  You learned a good lesson and will come out stronger and wiser because of it.  Life goes on, no point in beating yourself up over it too much now.
As far as gambling goes, I don't think gambling is a problem and I would never say "Don't gamble ever".  It's people having problems with self control that's the issue.  Most people gamble with disposable income and they usually go in with an attitude of they are simply paying for some entertainment.   When you're gambling with 100% of your savings though,  that's obvious a red flag that you have some self control issues and shouldn't gamble.

I agree bitcoin prices have never really been stable. Not really sure if it's been more volatile of lately or not but the fact that it's been huge dollars swings makes people notice it's volatility a lot more instead of when something goes to $2 to $4 in a day (still very volatile).
My question that I ask everyone, is how do we get bitcoin prices to be more stable. I personally feel like the prices need to be pretty stable for the average person to consider using it to buy/sell things and not just hoard/invest.

paypal could.... but currently they don't. end of discussion.  they simply don't accept any type of confirmation of bitcoins sent.  if someone says they didn't receive the bitcoin or someone hacked their paypal, they will win 100% of the time due to the current way paypal is set up.
and yes there are honest people who will want this service, you're right about that.  but the amount of people out there who want FREE money is a MUCH larger group of people.

I don't know if bitcoin will end up  being the winner, but the concept of p2p cryptocurrency is certainly here to stay and I agree it's the future of transactions. 
As other people have already mentioned, there's quite a few problems with bitcoin still for it to ever go mainstream,  either the bitcoin community addresses those problems over time or something else comes along that fixes those problems.

I believe dwolla use to make you wait 30 days before you could use any money you deposited. They did this on your first deposit. 
Seems CampBX is following suit.
While this is going to be annoying and cause problems for first time depositors , it really is in the best interest of consumer protection and an exchange protecting itself as well.

haha i was thinking the same thing. was definitely expecting something a lot more negative than what the title indicated.
Good read though, some really interesting points he made. Both good and bad.

I'll let the courts figure this one out.  Based on mtgox's failure to live up to expectations in the past though I'm not too surprised to see they failed to deliver with coinlabs as well (allegedly) 
The whole "they are inexperienced so cut them slack" thing doesn't really hold weight when you sign a business contract and flop on your promises, real people are losing money because of some of mtgox's decisions or lack there of.
Like I said though, I'll let the courts figure this one out if it goes that far.  Bitcoin itself will still be around whether there is mtgox or not, mtgox has helped a lot with getting bitcoin more popular but something else will surely come along if mtgox were to go away. And that something else would have the advantage of learning from mtgox's mistakes and growing pains.

I agree, just wait and let it play out and wait for more details to come out.

110% you will get screwed over.
there's literally nothing stopping people from screwing you over due to the way paypal protection works. 
you're basically hoping that the world is full of nothing but honest people and no one would ever try to take free easy money.  sadly, that's not how the world works.

I'll try to get a translation up on here later when I have time.  Kinda hard to translate 10 minutes worth of stuff. I can get the general message translated though.
Kind of surprised the government is OK with BTC so far.  In the past China has outlawed online currencies.  And China's government is usually never a fan of something they don't have full control over.
