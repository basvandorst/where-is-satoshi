I researched the Bitcoin technology and it seemed a positive step.

How well is developed  system of payment for services and goods using Bitcoins in China? I'm going on a trip and don't want to exchange a lot of money cos of losing it on transactions. 
Will I be able to pay my lunch using Bitcoins in Burger King for example?

What is the meaning that the money were found?
Necessary to know the owners of wallets, as it was noticed here, and it is almost impossible

Why don't you want to mine the BTC?

Your videos are great! I found them very helpful. 
Education is the best way to promote and develop Bitkoint especially at top universities.
 Wish you good work and good luck!

I think that the use of Bitcoins should be a serious financial decision.
Of course, this kind of support is needed by the system. But rapid development of whole system depends precisely from the people interested in this,not just from the "investors."
But such support is the best way  today.

It eliminates steps 4 through 9 in the Original Post of this thread?

It's cool! It is the first time I hear about such serious purchase using Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:16:30
I think it's great idea! Bitcoin is a strong and competitive system which reached a high development level and should start using by public institutions.

It is awesome!
Do I understand correctly the Lego accepts Bitcoins now ?
@_date: 2014-04-28 15:30:08
It looks amazing!
 Has anyone tried to use it and knows the commision rate of a ATM?It takes only a euro or dollars also?
@_date: 2014-05-27 11:02:25
I like that Bitcoin ATM are spreading in states of U.S.

I think Bitcoin is not popular due to lack of awareness among people. IMO, it is the main reason.
