You don't yet have the "online storage with file manager", so are the uploads (as a member) tied to the account currently?
The whole Java thing is a major turn off. I would have more trust in a download manager than having to have Java installed as a plugin in my browser. There seems to be a new exploit every minute for it these days.
Regardless, I enabled Java (I have it disabled by default) and tried uploading and downloading after registering, and everything seems to be working just fine.

I have a feeling the user-side encryption won't change a whole lot, in terms of illegal file sharing. Well, public file sharing at least. There are thousands of smaller sites sharing links to files that require registration to see links, for instance. It would be hard for companies to register for them all, check all of the downloads, and then report the copyrighted material in question.
At that point you might be legally obligated to remove the files, but I don't know where you're based or the laws. Another question would be once copyrighted material was found to be hosted from a company finding the password and downloading the file -- would you ever (if you are not currently) be forced to track the IPs of those who upload? I'd guess you would.
The client-side encryption before upload is still pretty nice. It alleviates the requirement for you to have to take a checksum of the uploaded files and compare it against known copyrighted works, so it would be very easy for the same file to be reuploaded within minutes of its take down, and it could take days before it is removed again.
