The question of trust wouldn't be such a big problem if the registrar was controlled by the Namecoin maintainers.
This could be a bridge if you will from where we are now (hopelessly centralized domains) to where we wanna get (decentralized options such as .bit). When there is more .bit domains it will be easier to make the case for Mozilla and other other browser developers to add support to blockchain domains.
ICANN has a process for granting these ggTlds and even though the .bit is currently available, it most likely wouldn't pass their approval process if the applicant wasn't the Namecoin maintainers themselves.

Well, Bitcoin itself is not very private. For those instances where you need privacy you can always give out your btc address in a more private manner.

Naming system and privacy conscious, see guys?
I don't get one thing though. Is it blockchain  based? Or it only works with their own wallet ?

Linux excessive number of distros is the reason the desktop and laptop markets are still dominated by Windows/Mac.
Sure people are free to fork, but there needs to be more awareness in the bitcoin community of malicious forks that only seek to sow division among us.
Beware of fork and conquer.

Well, there is a way of getting namecoin domains (.bit) resolved on every browser over night.
By purchasing the ggTld .bit from ICANN and as the owner of the TLD, resolve it using the namecoin blockchain.
That could be accomplished easily if the namecoin maintainers would start a foundation and then collect the ICANN fee of $200,000 on Kickstarter.
Problem is some of those guys are too utopian to ever get any real world thing ever done, they need more  pragmatism.

Makes me wanna start a lightning node :D
Where do I start?

I tried that on my Mac, went from 2 days to 6 hours and still dropping fast :D
This should be by default!!!

Couldn't namecoin be adapted for it? That could give .bit domains some traction as well.

And an address like 1kaksnndhshsnkaabsb is less prone to phishing?
Should we stop using domain names and use IP's too?

Good point.
Here's another one,  avoid endless forks.
See what they did to Linux with the endless distributions: consumer is confused by all the choices, goes for Windows/Mac instead.
Beware of fork and conquer.

Very unsafe indeed.
Just consider for a moment that many WiFi printers send a copy of everything you print to their servers somewhere out there.
Good example is Brother iPrint&amp;Scan app. It sends everything you print or scan to their  servers.

I care a great deal about privacy, believe me.
But why having a naming system necessarily implies a privacy loss?
And even if it did, such a system would still be useful in cases we don't care for the privacy such as a business collecting a payment. You could always give out  a non public address to receive a private payment.

I will check it out. Seems ETH is making progress on this with their .ETH naming system. Some registrars are already offering it even, I've seen it at  Internet.bs
