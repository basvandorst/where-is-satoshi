I do! I pay my 2 crypto friends with nano. For dinners and beers. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 13:38:34
Is this good or bad? What does this mean? 
@_date: 2019-02-27 13:10:25
I walk by it often but I never went in to see what’s actually going on there.

We’re not here for morals. We’re here for deflationary vs. inflationary currencies. I care more about owning my own money and not have it turn to nothing. I don’t want a government to take away what I rightfully earned. I don’t care about lazy beggars and homeless people. They are there by choice. Money is not evil.

I ate at that kimchi Korean restaurant on the second floor by the exit to the BTS. But I never been inside this bitcoin place. Is it an exchange of baht for crypto?

You know what I mean by fake news. Of course it’s fake. But Trevor has an underlying SJW agenda.

I thought futures are no good? People will short BTC into oblivion again.

How about the NASDAQ bitcoin futures 2.0? Since it will be settled with bitcoin and not paper bitcoin do you think this will be good or bad for growth of bitcoin price? 
@_date: 2019-01-12 20:23:42
Thanks for the explanation! 
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:41:52
Should we panic? 
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:32:56
Isn’t this good for bitcoin price? Less production = less available coins to sell
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:20:28
I’m buying small amounts right now during the dips. There still hasn’t been a trend reversal so I’m pretty confident it will drop a bit lower. At least $3,200-2,800
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:32:08

Why not? 
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:32:34
I’ll be waiting. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:24:25
Then stay home and don’t venture into the unknown woods!

Put half the money into dividend stocks, save the other half. move to Indonesia or Vietnam, find a nice lady open a bed and breakfast together.

Just don’t sell them for 30k!
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:38:36
You’re saying it right. Saying bitcoins sounds like saying “moneys” something a little kid would say. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:50:35
Yeah it should be ethereum or LTC at his left. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:10:39
I predict a strong move coming. Could be up or down. Or more sideways movement. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:22:07
You’re so salty it’s giving me hypertension. It would be great if it was 1000 I’d buy up real quick.

@_date: 2018-12-06 13:07:42
This is what I have in mind also. The bitcoin power bottom 
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:40:00
If it was my money I would spend 25% of my investment buying now. Then wait for a trend reversal and invest the rest. But since it’s your money go on buy in now! Could be 100k tomorrow morning.

Oh grandpa. Who let you out again? 
@_date: 2018-12-13 07:06:20
Are you in Bangkok? Get off at nana plaza station walk toward the “Times Square” area. On your right near all the Korean restaurants you will see a sign with bitcoin and ethereum logo. Go on and buy there. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:25:40
It’s my bad. Last year I wished to Santa for lower bitcoin prices. So I could buy more. It’s just my wish coming true. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 20:23:45
You just got cucked!

Bitcoin is old, don’t expect it to perform every time. This is what we call in trading “ED” or erectile dysfunction.
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:11:26
I have been buying aggressively into this power bottom. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:53:46
How can they do that? The codes are in my head. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:27:59
I love the guy and his energy.

Use coinbase so you can take your crypto and place it in your own wallet or ledger. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:24:29

@_date: 2018-12-07 20:49:10
It is with paper futures.

A power bottom 
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:52:23
Yeah it most likely will go below 3k. There is a lot of irrational panic currently.
