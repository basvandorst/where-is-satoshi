I will not miss intentionally misspelling "hold".

No, he is just explaining it to people who didn't get the joke, like me.

It's a crypto currency where you can use the currency in exchange for computing power from the miners. You can run programs, websites, and services completely decentralized on Ethereum.
This way Ethereum's value is not closely tied to centralized entities and outside things, because you can buy a common resource from the decentralized network itself.
E: spelling

Seriously, this post is trying to say that paper currency is unstable. News flash! Bitcoin's value is so unstable people use it as a risky *investment*. Bitcoin is still getting there.

Rip me.
But that was a cheap woosh, because I had no way of knowing it was misspelled since that how I thought it was spelled.
Going to fix it though, thanks.

I couldn't resist, and gave into the temptation and bought it.

Detroit Maker Faire
The company is called [cyberoptix]( They make and sell their ties in Detroit. I think they have a HODL tie as well.

Mark: This sounds sloppy, what should we name it?
Joe: I have an idea.

Don't let your deams be without monetary value!

I'm not going to argue the stability of paper currency, but the post is trying to say that paper currency is bad because it is unstable. Bitcoin's value is so unstable people use it as a *risky investment*. They are trying to say "paper currency bad, crypto good," but they use an argument that Bitcoin also fails miserably at. (Don't worry Bitcoin is slowly getting there though!)

The store also accepted Bitcoin as payment, as well as other crypto currency such as Ethereum.
