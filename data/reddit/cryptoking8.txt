If you live in Canada; I like QuadrigaCX as it is easy to get your ID verified and you can deposit dollars via Interac (1.5% fee).  Transaction fees are 0.5%. Site is generally user-friendly; but, you pay slightly more for the convenience.
Kraken is also great and bitcoin is usually less expensive; however, ID verification can take a while and you have to bank wire CAD (0.1% fee) to them and depending on your bank.. can be slow. Transaction fees are anywhere from 0% to 0.26% (depending on your trading volume).  The site is not the user-friendliest; but, is a good value.  
Coinsquare is another one that takes CAD; they do crypto and gold and silver too.. more expensive than the above and lower volumes.
.. hope this helps

Depending on how much you want to buy; there are other exchanges that take CAD and you can buy BTC at a better trade price.

I agree.. demand really started taking off in May once South Korea and Japan gave cryptocurrencies their blessing.

I don't think we're anywhere close to critical mass yet.  Going by the numbers off of blockchain.info .. there are 17.6 million wallet addresses of which 97% have less than $5 worth of BTC (these accounts can be completely disregarded or dead); leaving approx. 531,000 wallets (users) .. let's round up to 600K users; given population of the G20 countries is approx 4.6 billion (theoretical users) we are at less than a tenth of 1% of the global market penetration.
Also, if we compare global market cap of crypto ($167 billion) vs just the the market cap of the S&amp;P500 alone ($21 trillion) = 0.8% .. long way before we hit critical mass IMHO.
