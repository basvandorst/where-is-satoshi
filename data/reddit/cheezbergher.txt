It's true. Eventually we're going to need a regulatory body that has the power to break up hashing monopolies, if such a thing is even possible.

This concept is not new. He's basically describing [Freenet]( which has been around since 2000.

That's what Bitpay is for. Still deposits $'s in you bank account much sooner than the major ACH processors.

Go back to fucking your cousin, redneck faggot.
@_date: 2014-11-16 23:25:06
I don't see why that couldn't be added to Freenet.

Your car made cream my pants. You have fantastic taste, sir!

 No, that was caused by a bug!

I'm not sure I understand the purpose of this. At the listed hash rate, it would take at least 6 years for this thing to pay itself off, and that's assuming you can get free power.

Yeah obviously, but are you aware of the [increase in blockchain difficulty in just the last couple of years]( And the performance of mining chips is increasing just as fast while their prices continue to decrease. 
If you want to spend $400 to help diversify the network, be my guest. But you will never make any money off this thing.

Does anyone? It's just a Raspberry Pi with an ASIC miner board on top and some preinstalled software. It's too expensive for what it does. You can get a few USB antminers and a raspberry pi on your own for 2x the GH/s per $.

Maybe, I saw it hit $395 today and it was around $335 two days ago. It's down to $355 right now though which is making me nervous; I wish it would just hit $400 already!
I think it only reached $200 less than a month ago. I've got a pretty strong feeling that we're inside another bubble right now.

I would lose a lot of money if I converted it back to bitcoins and moved them to Bitstamp though
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:45:17
crap... how do i get $10k out of gox then? Reinvest it as bitcoin first?
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:49:16
That sucks dude.
Opposite thing happened to me. 3 years ago I made a Mt. Gox account a few months after they opened and I bought 65 BTC for less than a $ each.
Then somehow I sort of forgot about my account.
Two days ago I found the login for my account saved in an old DataVault database I had saved on my old computer. Logged into the account and my jaw practically fell off my face when I saw my 65 BTC was now worth over $20k. I sold 30 of them the other day for around $10k, saving the rest for now.
I've been freaking out for the past few days about it. Should I pull the rest out now or hold onto it? I can't help but feel like this is a bubble and it may be my last chance to get that kind of return.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:49:31
Awesome, thanks. I needed that reassurance. It definitely looks like we're in another bubble right now though, but I think I'm going to hold through it.
Another question if you don't mind. Mt. Gox is making me nervous since I've heard a lot of people complain about how difficult or long it was to withdraw cash and I've also seen they've had a couple of major lawsuits this year. Would it be a lot smarter to pull the coins out and deposit them in a wallet on my computer, then perhaps save them on a few hard drives that I stash somewhere? What's the best place to keep your coins for long-term holding? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:04:31
true. aw well, may not be a big loss after all. The pice is lower now than it was when I sold them so I put an order to buy back the coins.
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:56:28
Seriously, this is hurting their business. I pulled all of my BTC from Mt. Gox because nobody was able to withdraw.
