who the fuck upvoted this off-topic crap?

we don't need such heavy security against reposts.
also reposts aren't nearly as annoying as the trolls who keep spamming the same old arguments year after year, and a bot linked to a blockchain won't stop them.

muforce is a known troll. downvote, report, ignore. don't waste your time on him he won't even read your reply.
he is only here to make people like you waste their valuable time.

how is this important?
we don't *have* to become millionaires next week. we can live with natural adoption for a while.
who cares if without china we will become rich slightly slower as long as bitcoin prices rise several per cent each week?
don't mind the downvotes, there are either more active trolls than usual or a bot doing this today.

his point is that those things are surviving because there is demand for them even though they have deservedly or not a bad reputation.
bitcoin is incredibly useful compared to those things and fills a much bigger niche - imagine how well it will do :)

other emerging technology can't take over as any advantages other currencies have will just be assimilated by bitcoin.
and i think it depends on where you live. in europe propaganda doesn't seem to be as bad, we get told some lies in the printed press and constant warnings that bitcoin is backed by nothing but everyone knows it exists, is not controlled by anyone and is doing exceptionally well.
people i talk to don't even care that the price dropped recently because they're seeing the bigger picture.
word of mouth carries a lot more weight than anything you see on tv, read in newspapers or get told by banks (people here hate banks).
spread the word amongst your friends and let bitcoin grow naturally, we don't need artificial pumping.
i would love to be rich next year but i don't mind waiting a few more years either.

don't care.
edit: wow, someone turned off the downvote bot.

no shit sherlock.
of course the propaganda agents will use their shitty "tips fedora" meme on anything bitcoin related.
but it won't work. they've been trying to use that and similar memes to discredit hackers since the 90s, maybe even longer, and it never worked. it just slowed progress down but didn't stop it.
in a sense this is just the continuation of medieval age witchhunts - but we don't live in the medieval age anymore, ergo this tactic never ever worked and hopefully never will :)

it's brilliant, just don't let anyone catch you as writing on money is grey area in some regimes.

reminds me of how the closure of silk road made idiots panic sell, causing a dip much worse than SR's market cap :D
well, there are only so many idiots who can sell before they're out of bitcoins and we have no way of predicting when that will happen.
maybe it already happened and future FUD can't cause more drops.
remember how the SR panic sellers regretted their idiocy when the price exploded afterwards and never ever dipped below pre-SR-bust-lows again.

didn't even realize there was a video.
you guys should use NoScript, it might look like a handicap at first but it actually improves your browsing experience.

in case you haven't noticed, there's a bot or two running today that are downvoting everything that gets said here.
just upvote anyone with 0 points who isn't a troll.
