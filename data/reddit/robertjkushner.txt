no no no I'm not in dyer need. I make due with what I have.The struggle is real for a lot of folks. I just like the idea of looking out for the cook out as well. People work hard for their money not to have to hand it out. I'm surviving :) Thank you

Thats the way to do it! It takes more pennies to make dollars and more dollars to make coins. I've tipped out more then I received so I can no longer move forward until I make a deposit. 
They say that money talks, my just waves goodbye =\
Happy Tipping

I wish I had a warm meal today. A cup of dry cereal for breakfast and can tuna with no bread or mayo. May have a cup of hot noodles and a can vegetable on the side. Tomorrow I'm shit out of luck. Pay day isn't until next Friday so best believe I'll be hunting food pantries. It's almost deer season. Will not be hungry this winter :)

I'm noob here. Looking to learn the ropes =\ Where would be the best start? I'm just getting familiar with r/bitcoin

I would love to participate. Unfortunately I'm no bitcoin millionaire. I'll have to start by building my wallet. And then I can pass some coin on :)

I'm still new to this changetip. I think its an awesome idea. Yes I would install the app and my friends as well. I sell a lot of stuff on craigslist and it would be ideal if my buyers would pay with changetip although not many people know of bitcoin or other cryptocoin. I'm spreading the word of coin currency to my friends and family by sharing and liking threads. Hope more and more come together and make this happen. I would tip you u/worldcoiner thought my wallet is empty :) good luck on your journey

The price has seem to been neutral this week. rather steady. I hear its going to be on the rise again. I wish I would have bought them when they were cheap! =D

.50cents is a lot to people in america as well. considering the inflation of a dollar. it takes 2 incomes to run an average family and still thats not enough. ends wont ever meet =\

Credit card/debit card has always worked best for me.
