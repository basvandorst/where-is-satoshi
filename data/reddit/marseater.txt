How much have you got so far? Every time i cash out it goes into negative so i need to wait for it to go positive again...
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:39:53
tbh i have no idea whats going on. My account has been switching from postive to negative for a while although it stopped about 20 mins ago. I cashed out 0.15 just to see whether it worked...
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:47:24
Right, i think ive worked out whats happening, everyone who has transferred money in is getting that exact amount repeated every 10 minutes or so. I put in in 0.1 and i seem to get 0.1 every 10 mins, i assume you put in 2?
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:26:33
your retarded, like i said on my post on this issue
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:51:27
You are obviously retarded. These twitter stunts don't involve the money of the company's customers. No one cares if you get some random messages, people get spammed all the day. People care if a place where they are keeping their money is insecure and unstable. Its quite simple...

How do you figure that, they could have lost 100s of bitcoins plus this ruins confidence in their system. What happens if this money was coming from other peoples accounts. With me I could of taken 1 BTC, other people could of taken 60. Would of been the most stupid marketing trick ever
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:00:22
Ah, makes sense, if this is happening to many more people though most wont be as noble as you....

I transferred from kraken, and then it started happening...

woops, just re-read it, your right - my memory must be going...
I cashed out to a paper wallet so i think im safe though
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:44:35
two bitcoins?!? how long has yours been going on for?
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:06:25
Yeh, ive message them as well...
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:40:42
I've read that article before, dont see how it relates though...
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:19:55
yeh i'm -.48 some crazy shit going on
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:53:35
That explains it, it matches your deposit every 8 minutes.... this could be the end of cryptsy
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:50:48
As in 2 extra? It will work if its like mine... I wonder how many people this is affecting
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:17:39
I've used this, does work but has a bit of a mark up, probably the easiest way to get bitcoins though
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:45:29
I'm not going to keep the bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:24:39
I think the whole website is a bit confused at the moment
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:42:15
Oh SgtFuckface, you do make me laugh
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:13:37
You dont need to give them any of that stuff
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:32:54
HA, maybe, depends whether they allow me to keep them, ive cashed out some just to see whether it works - which it did
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:45:24
How much did you transfer in originally from coinbase?
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:39:54
You think we're part of the advertising campaign? You're very cynical aren't you

This will destroy their whole company if they dont look the email i sent to them!
