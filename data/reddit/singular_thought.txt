There is no need to send them to another party.

He might be using a Bcash (bitcoin cash) wallet.
Have him confirm which he is using.
If he is using Bcash he can export his private key from the Bcash wallet and import it into a Bitcoin wallet and the funds will appear there.

There is a lot of malware out there that does one thing:  Sit quiet and invisible but constantly scanning the computer for anything that looks like a bitcoin private key.
The instant it finds the key it will send it to the people who wrote the malware and in a few seconds they will transfer the bitcoins to their secured wallet.  Even if you disconnect from the internet to use the key, the malware will just sit quiet until you reconnect and it will then transmit your private key.
Poof.  Gone.
With a hardware wallet like Trezor this become impossible because the private key never leaves the physical device and can never be accessed by any means.
If you get a trezor, ensure you accurately write down the 24 seed words and put them in a safe place.  They will be used to recover your wallet should the physical device be lost or damaged.  The order of the words is also vital.  They cannot be used to recover your wallet if a single word is out of order.
Do not let anyone see the 24 words.  Do not copy them to your computer.  Do not take a picture of them.  Do not record them on anything other than the piece of paper.
Whoever knows those words in that order will have access to your bitcoins.

Check out YouTube for a detailed explanation... but it will support an unlimited number of transactions per second.  The only limitation will be computer speed and network bandwidth.

Give it some time.  Some exchanges take a few hours to process a transaction.
If you are in the US, go to bed and check it in the morning.
I don’t think a bitcoin transaction can be initiated without a well formed target address. (An incorrect address, yes, but not a bad or empty address)
Edit:  If it isn’t there in the morning, send a support request to the exchange.

At first the internet was difficult and only for geeks.  In time it became easy for everyone.  
It's just a matter of time before the same happens with Bitcoin, and especially the Blockchain.  I can't wait to see what all will be done with that.  There is so much potential outside of the currency arena.

Use two factor authentication on all online accounts.
Keep your coins on a hardware wallet.
Don’t trust any incoming communication.
Verify all incoming claims by contacting the exchange, bank or credit card company directly using a phone number you already have as a result of doing business in the past.

BTC does not have futures markets (yet) so there is no one shorting BTC.
Most likely people who thought “I better get out while it’s good.  Don’t get greedy with investing.”
A bunch of coins hit the market and the backlog of buy orders gets emptied out causing the lower limit orders to start getting processed.
Anyone on an exchange can let a limit order to buy BTC at $1.00 but odds are the low supply of coins for sale will prevent that order from ever executing.  If a large supply hits the exchange, the limit orders will start executing from highest to lowest.  This is what triggers a dip.

The 2FA is for online accounts, such as email, bank accounts and crypto exchange accounts.
It is also very useful for hardware wallets (such as Trezor) in case someone gets physical access to it.  By default Trezor has a PIN number that must be entered for it to function.  Every time the wrong PIN is entered the Trezor doubles the wait time between attempts.
The only way to steal from a hardware wallet with a PIN is with the old “Five dollar wrench attack”.  (

No, there is no additional security risk.
The core node is the only service listening on that port and therefore the only process that will respond to incoming traffic.
If there was a security risk it would be due to a vulnerability in the bitcoin source code and all nodes would be vulnerable.  Such a vulnerability could cause anything from a minor inconvenience for all the nodes to a catastrophic collapse of the entire network.  This is why the source code is tested as much as it is.  It’s some of the most tested code out there.  
Go to Help &gt; Debug Window.  In the Debug window click the peers tab.  This is a list of all incoming and outgoing connections.  If you run the node long enough you’ll notice a list of banned IP addresses at the bottom.  These are the incoming connections that your node detected as trying to do things that break the Blockchain rules.  Those “naughty” nodes have been blocked by all nodes they tried to interact with... basically they were quarantined from the entire bitcoin network and your node helped enforce the quarantine.

Give it the ability to import public addresses (qr code or text paste) so balances (and total $ Balance) can be tracked for various coins.
With this, the users’ balances will always be up to date even if they are active traders.
