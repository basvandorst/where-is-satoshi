That Video is textbook for what not to do. Next time place the camera directly opposite of your subject and place your dialog on a tablet PC and slowly scroll it. Most importantly don't lie. 
Edit: figuratively speaking.

This is why you shouldn't let paid shills masquerading as news shape your opinion. I invested 7 bucks to date I'm only down by ~50 cents. even still BTC value hasn't dropped below the Dollar yet. Nothing the denziens of bullshit mountain push can ever refute that.

united Airlines. I was bumped off a flight home from SFO and had to exit th terminal to speak to an agent to reroute. she thought because of the type of ticket I had I was an employee and proceeded to give me the harshest treatment I've ever experienced. "I'm sorry I don't have time to deal with a customer of your status".  she shut me off mid sentence. I can't tell you the levels of restraint I had to channel. Fuck United

Ididn't want to link it for fear of getting banned but the title on youtube is BITCOIN VS. ________  EXPLAINED FOR NOOBZ + Why MICROSOFT Likes It. 
The video itself didn't do much for me in terms of advocating one over the other. However it did make me want to pay more attention to what is happening right now. Is there a summary of what has happened So far? 
I didn't mean the debate was the cause for concern sorry, I just meant that the problems addressed by the debate continue to go unresolved in a manner of speaking. 
Thanks for the explanation. I feel like I have a better understanding  of whats happening.  Hoping for a proposal that works for everyone.

Marijuana tax act for bitcoin. Sorry but we ain't falling for that.

Ah I see. I'm scratching the surface on one topic and as I am invested in the second(is that the correct terminology? Does owning bitcoin make you a stakeholder or a shareholder? ) It seems to me the that the proponents for the BTC alternative claim that both are based on the same idea(blockchain) just that the alternative can do more comprehensive things.  The way the guy in the video explained it, it seems like the alternative was more favorable to entities seeking recurring automated payments(which is a cautionary flag for me). But if the Idea is sound and unexploitable I can see how the current debate may be cause for concern. But as a hodler, to me that is just a sixth of what the BTC market cap is around. I remain Steadfast.

That was very grounding. Thanks for your Insight. I'm just a hodler but  I'm looking at ways to use bitcoin in a more profitable manner.
