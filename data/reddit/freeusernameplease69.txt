As long as people think there is a correlation it is enough to drive the price. I believe enough people think there is a correlation, to profit highly from the next halving.

Why do we need a transaction fee market if the difficulty adjusts depending on number of miners?

If you are that poor how do you deal with Bitcoin transaction fees?

When I got into Bitcoin this was the meme constantly posted on r/bitcoin:

Do you know if the Bitcoins mainly stay on the localbitcoins site or do people take them out of there? The use cases you described sound mostly so that they stay on the site and don't hit the blockchain.

I have no words if that is the case.

Care to elaborate what is the usual usecase for Bitcoin? You get paid weekly in cash, run to the closest Localbitcoins trader at the local shop? Use bitcoin directly to buy goods or sell them to others when in need of cash to buy goods?

I'm a simple man and like things that I can confirm already working. And with working I don't mean technically or in theory. I'll get interested in lightning once the ecosystem works as a whole. Meaning that people enter the lightning network straight through fiat gateways and never leave the lightning network before converting back to fiat. I just don't see it feasible for the really poor people to manage their lightning channels themselves.
If companies like Localbitcoins adopted lightning I would get somewhat excited. But as this would make it easy for poor people to transfer their money of their platform, I slightly doubt they will be pushing for lightning anytime soon.. I wish I am wrong.

It's only cringy-worthy for people who entered after 2014

You do realize that you pay for the size of the transaction in bits not dollars? It would cost the same even if it was $2.5 he was moving.
