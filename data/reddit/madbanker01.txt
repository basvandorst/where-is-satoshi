I don't see this as a regulation of bitcoin issue. A government official is there to serve the people in a democracy. He is not there to abuse his power to make money at the expense of others. What he did may be totally legal, but that doesn't mean he should be able to continue in a position of trust within the government.

I imagine you are talking about normal AML &amp; KYC rules. When folks sell their bitcoin and transfer the fiat to the credit union, the credit union needs to check the origin of the funds. Much like if you turned up with a suitcase of cash.

Not entirely true. Most high end brokerages can arrange the purchase of partial shares (MSSB for one). It scares me to think about this, because it clearly means that there is some form of hidden pooling or derivatives going on under the covers that the client is completely unaware of.....

You are correct in that I am hedged in that way. My issue is not personal, but for the success of crypto in general. I can't see merchant adoption advancing until this is resolved. If you were a retailer, would you even consider accepting any crypto right now? Bitcoin is too slow &amp; fees are too high, no other crypto is the clear leader, so the easy thing to do is to just accept fiat.

It depends on why you are in to bitcoin. 
If it is just to make money, and if the $2000 you made means a great deal to you, then sell.
If you want to learn, and if you want to be part of the revolution then hodl.
If the potential opportunity of a truly life changing amount of wealth is more important than the risk of loosing the entire 1btc, then hodl.

CME launched 7 hours ago. Impact on Bitcoin is open to debate, but it is definitely a major development. From my perspective, one of the most significant aspects, which is little discussed, is that it solves the price discovery question, and thus paves the way for an ETF which will ultimately allow institutional investors to buy the underlying Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:06:50
I wouldn't buy a whole one in your situation, but I doubt you would regret putting 10% of your lottery winnings into bitcoin. Buy 1/10th of a coin, and enjoy being part of the experiment.

Rather than just launching an ISP, why not a whole parallel decentralized internet, with encryption at the core. I think Kim Dotcom is working on something of this type - except I imagine his will not be decentralized.

My guess is that absolutely nothing will happen in the first few hours. Remember the futures are dated for January, they will be cash settled, and they will only allow balanced trades. To me this means nothing will happen in the short term. Long term, the price discovery alone will lead to ETFs being approved, and greater credibility in the traditional markets, which will drive prices higher - possibly much higher.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:02:49

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:12:24
Not really. No one mentioned buying in. No one has a great strategy. Everyone knows crypto is risky. The point we are making is that this is not the end of the world. If you invested amounts you can afford to lose, then relax - whether you decide to sell, hold or buy more. There are lots of reasons to be positive about bitcoin's future. As this thead is about depression, the message is valid and not irresponsible. If the risk is too high for someone to the point of depression,  then they should sell some of their coins, but they really shouldn't feel the need to panic.

This is becoming a worrying trend. There are a few tales like this on here. AML risk is usually the excuse - which from the bank's perspective does have some validity due to the regulated world of fiat banking. The regulators are the 21st century red flag men, the banks gladly do their bidding - especially when it protects their interests.
It also reminds me of the Wikileaks blockade. 
The means of control that Andreas talked about is becoming increasingly evident. 
We need to start a list of bitcoin friendly banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:46:11
I mean something Satoshi foresaw and expected. I know that is an appeal to authority, but in this context is valid. Also the problems around that particular change only come to play if the increase is larger than the technology improvements can accommodate. I am talking about a small increase until lightening is ready. If it wasn't for all the BS, I don't see why this hasn't already been adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:18:19

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:42:44
Okmilk's point is valid though. There have been countless bigger (as  a %) corrections in the past, and prices have recovered every time. I imagine very few long term holders are selling. The point he is making to noobs is fair. That does not negate the other good advice here not to invest more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:34:52
A solution to the scaling issue &amp; real possibility of a physical ETF (not a futures based one) will lead to much wider adoption and price appreciation IMHO.
Maybe I have coined a new phrase there - a "physical bitcoin ETF" - I know it is a contradiction, but for those who don't know, a physical ETF holds the actual commodity or stock that it tracks, as opposed to a synthetic ETF that tries to match the price of the commodity or stock through derivatives and other financial magic and wizardry.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:55:14
A sensible block size increase is not a hack. It was envisioned from early days. I agree lightening is a better solution,  but we need something  until it is ready and adopted. It hurts me to watch merchant adoption and ATM deployment going backwards when there is no need. It is pig headed stupidity not to use a block size increase in the interim.

No one should criticize your thinking. You should not take more risk than you are comfortable with. I would say though that expecting only upward movement is very unrealistic. It might (or might not) fall a long way before upward movement returns, but I expect in 5 years we will have much higher prices. The $100,000 to $1M per btc that some pundits predict are not outside the realm of possibility, and I would say are quite likely if we can get the scaling issue sorted out, and adoption becomes widespread.

That doesn't count because it relies on user and provider action. Bitcoin is based on incentives &amp; game theory. You can't blame users for not acting in a particular way. The system needs to ensure that they do. Satoshi understood this, I don't believe the core devs do.
@_date: 2018-09-10 12:21:42
That is a pretty significant development. Obviously only really relavent for Canada, but it does make it less risky for the SEC (for them) to approve an ETF.

Couldn't add text to the link, so adding as a comment. Steve Hanke (not a bitcoin lover BTW) talks about inflation, and describes a log linear collapse of failed currencies during extreme hyperinflation periods. Looking at it from a bitcoin perspective this describes all fiat currencies at the current time - i.e. bitcoins apparent log linear growth is exactly the same as a log linear collapse of the fiat currency being compared.

You are right, I am sure that there is some of that going on. However if bitcoin continue to mature, it is a near certainty that one will get approved eventually. I am just disappointed that a physical ETF didn't come before leveraged trading and derivatives. What worries me is what happens if the first ETF to get approved is based on derivatives.

It will be like talking someone out of their religion. I will respond to one point though. You seem to imply that bitcoin serves no useful purpose, all I would say to that is to talk to a Venezuelan, or an African worker in a developed country trying to send money home to their sick or aging parents. If you have difficult finding people of these profiles, I can probably make an introduction. Get a clue, and look outside your rose garden.
@_date: 2018-08-22 22:59:37
Thanks for the question. It gives me the opportunity to add the explanation to the thread.
Basically, there are many variations of this mechanism, but the simplest form of manipulation is that you take out a massive contract on the future price of bitcoin. This costs you $x, with the potential to gain say $10x if you are right. You can now afford $9x to manipulate the underlying bitcoin market by trading on regular exchanges to make sure that your bet pays off. Obviously, more complex variations of this are possible, particularly if you know an exchange is about to go offline etc.
As bitcoin is not a regulated market, this probably isn't even illegal. If you did it with stocks, you would go to jail if caught.

I think the problem with that thought experiment is that the change is instantaneous. If society transitioned  gradually to one without religion, other societal responses &amp; solutions would emerge, so I don't think we would see the kind of effect you imply.
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:31:18
Back in the 80s, I used to think like that. Since then, I have come to realize that markets are more fragile than we sometimes think. I am not asking people to behave as I do. I am asking people to study the issues in order for the market to operate as rationally and evenly as possible.
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:23:37
I can think of lots of ETFs where this would apply, but it didn't stop them from getting approval.
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:55:59
Once we have a USD denominated ETF, we will then soon have ones denominated in Euros, Pounds, Yen etc. A reduction in volatility is what is needed to think of the price of real world products in bitcoin. The ETF will lead to that.

The world definitely needs multiple payment channels. A monopoly on this is a very dangerous situation for freedom &amp; democracy. It will be interesting to see if Germany or the EU can pull this off though. TBH,  bitcoin isn't ready for for this kind of application, but it will be one day :)

Nice sermon, but doesn't have anything to do with the point I raised.
@_date: 2018-08-25 23:03:24
I didn't suggest a link between reasonableness and atheism (or bitcoin). I know some very reasonable religious people, and some very unreasonable bitcoiners and atheists. Please don't take offense by my question, none was intended, nor was I suggesting any form of superiority of one philosophy over another. I am just trying to see if there is a high degree of correlation between the 2 subjects. I also take your point about religions challenging authority, but I see this more during the establishment of a new religion, not in following an established or majority religion. I think the communist connection is a red (pun intended) herring though, as in a way communism, particularly of the Russian flavor can almost be seen as a surrogate religion.

You are actually right about one thing. Sociopaths do tend to float to the top in investment banks, however there are also a lot of smart people within the system who are working against them. At every turn, we tie thier shoelaces together and slip laxatives into their food. Sometimes we even do things to promote bitcoin, like pushing for an ETF.

I never said it was risk free. The point is that you can gain big by successfully manipulating the market. This is especially true with derivatives. With typical bitcoin volumes, it is not difficult for those with deep pockets to achieve. The risk is like all things, mitigated by doing it many times. Some you will win, some you will lose, but being incentivised to manipulate a thin marked is likely to lead to manipulation.

In a free market exchange rates exist. These are bi-directional. Today 1 Euro = 1.15 USD / 1USD = 0.87 Euros. Do you think folks in Euroland value their potatoes in USD? This is a non-issue. When we get bitcoin value stability, then we can start valuing things in bitcoin, and not before.

I know a lot of the guys and girls at MS, and the majority are very smart individuals - I mean really smart individuals. What I find interesting is what happens when you put a lot of smart people together in a regulated,and controlled corporation. The IQ of the individuals is not reflected in the IQ of the organization. I tend to think the same is true of morals. The individuals in investment banks are - believe it or not - some of the most altruistic people I have met, but that is not how the investment bank itself behaves.

I partly agree. One of the key weapons we have is "avoiding involvement", but expecting the market to take care of the problem is dangerous, because WE are the market. That is why my first ask was a request to learn. I fear that those involved with the issues that I listed are more literate in legacy finance, than many bitcoiners, and as such risk being taken advantage of as mainstream finance inevitably gets more involved in our project.

That is a very insightful piece, and made me think about the ETF a little differently. That said, for the first time ever I don't fully agree with Andreas - particularly about the manipulation part. Either way though, I do agree that it is inevitable at some point. It is just a part of bitcoin growing up. The voting piece is an interesting angle though, and one that I hadn't thought much about before. That said, ETFs have rules, and the policy on voting could be one way that an ETF differentiates itself from another. The main reason that I am still pro an ETF is that I believe the increase in capital will reduce volatility, which I see as the main thing holding back adoption as a currency.

In some ways, your comment is correct - my statement is possibly a bit OTT in the context of the specific example, however in a democracy, it is the duty of the population to safeguard the system from such dangers. If 1935 Germany is too extreme an example, I would suggest that you take a very close look at present day Turkey, and the last 15 years of its history.

That is one perspective, but not a well thought out one. Let me take a few of your points:
"*So how exactly do you safe guard my 5 million investment from manipulation that’s orchestrated over the border, and plays against the laws and rules set by the SEC?*"
That is true for every commodity - oil, gold, copper etc. Whilst it is true that they are harder to move across borders, they definitely do cross borders, and are more often than not purchased across borders.
"*You don’t think pension funds are going to gamble their clients money down the drain surely, and only a mad man would stake his future retirement fund on a volatile token like BTC.*"
Self invested pensions certainly will. Managed pensions will probably invest a very small percentage as part of a diversification strategy. Do not mistake risk for bad.
"*Take a look at the price, low price low adoption.*" 
Are you kidding? $6000 per bitcoin is hardly low. 2 years ago, it was less than $600. All that is happening now is a natural ringing from the over exuberance when it hit $20,000. It will take time to re-stabilize. Ping me in 2020.

I doubt that will ever happen. What I think we can hope for though is that banks of the future will be less powerful, more transparent, and only able to provide services that do add value. Basically not recognizable as banks of today. 
You also need to see the 3 types of banks for what they are:
Central banks = money supply manipulators for government whims and wars. They primarily cause inflation and global poverty
Investment banks = Businesses that make money out of other peoples money by providing services that are sometimes of real value, sometimes defective, and sometimes weapons of mass destruction
Retail banks = financial police, who need to know what we use our money for in order to approve our spending, and to protect us
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:59:15
The difference in the 2 is that the lira is on a well known path that has been demonstrated by many other countries, whereas bitcoin is a solution to their problems. Some of the more significant examples of central bank overprinting are in the Hanke Krus Hyperinflation list: [
In short the lira's value is almost guaranteed to fall further, whereas bitcoin is likely to ultimately increase in value.

@_date: 2018-08-22 04:28:08
My point is exactly that. Through arbitrage and normal market mechanics, you would expect all exchanges to have a similar set of pending orders. Just pulling the plug on BitMEX shouldn't significantly affect the price, even if it allows the most leveraging &amp; shorting.

Makes sense, particularly if it is an option. What I mean is that it requires a little more trust than converting at the BTM, so when a customer has established that trust, it would make sense to streamline operations.
@_date: 2014-10-17 22:26:15
Theoretically, Circle would be the answer, you should be able to set it up, and transfer to a credit card or bank account in minutes, however I tried today, and can't link it to my Canadian bank or credit card. I know others have succeeded.

If there is no announcement on Friday, and then nothing by mid day Monday, then it is going to be fun watching the price on Monday afternoon. That roller coaster gif is likely to get some serious wear. Whoever owns it should lubricate it in preparation.
I'm just a spectator who knows nothing, but my guess is that they would have announced by now if they were going to, which would mean that they are deliberately letting it  go by default. Why wait for the last possible moment?????  - Unless they want to torture us.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:30:52
Can't say I agree with that perspective, although I would agree that there are some relationships between the various points.
'1. Side Chain - I think you miss the point. You don't need "access to their side chain" for the ETF to act as a side chain. If I sell one ETF unit, and you buy one, then that happens off-chain.
'2.  My grandmother will never use Coinbase
'3 &amp; 4 are definitely not the same things, although I agree that my pension example of a regulated entity was a bad one.
'5 - Existing derivatives are are not easily accessible to those likely to use them - ie regulated professional traders.
'6 is tightly linked to 2 (not 3 &amp; 4)

May be, may be not. I don't want to fuel a bubble, but I think markb_uk's logic is reasonable. Assuming that the bitcoin price is proportional to the number of users, then due to the network effect, an annual doubling is very achievable until the growth runs up against some kind of limit - hence why he has a topping out number. This is basic exponential growth, and is seen in many natural and financial systems (think virus growth etc). This is also why we often use log scale for financial charts.

@_date: 2017-03-10 00:29:14
I was wondering this. It would be cool if someone developed a tool where you type in a number of bitcoins, and it estimates how many people have that number or more. Obviously it would need to make lots of assumptions, but I would think that with some quality research that the assumptions could be reasonably accurate - eg by blockchain analysis to look at coin to wallet distribution etc.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:06:05

@_date: 2017-03-01 18:44:36
I partly agree with that, however saying that just because the tx's will be new - ie that they would never have hit the main chain without the ETF, doesn't take in to account that the new transactions represent growth. ie more transactions will occur, and more people can trade or hodl BTC without a proportional increase in main chain capacity.

What is interesting about this, is not that it is yet another bitcoin project to save Venezuela, but that  Prof. Steve H. Hanke is promoting it. Hanke has not been a supporter of crypto up to now - and reading the article leaves it unclear whether he really is, but he is at least warming to it, and has found a use for it. Hanke (Google him) is a well respected economist, and something of a guru when it comes to hyper-inflation.

Im not going to comment on Brexit pros &amp; cons, but what I find fascinating is that Bitcoin is starting to act like a normal asset class - ie the price is responding to world events in ways that are to some extent logical. I think the way that it has moved throughout the Brexit saga will give BTC more credability as a mainstream financial tool.  Just my 2c.

You may get a pre-announcement indicator on Bitcoinity :)  - the price will probably move sharply up or down about an hour before the announcement.....for some inexplicable reason of course.
That is if there is an announcement. My more likely guess is that they will let time run out, and thus approve by default.

There are many people with assets in ETFs who don't even know how to switch a computer on, and probably don't even know that they have assets in ETFs. 
Your point on side-chains is like saying that there is no benefit in any side-chain.

I plan to champion this campaign, and treat everyone so politely and in a gentlemanly fashion, that anyone behaving otherwise will look and feel like an ass.

Well put. Unity is more important than many of the details being fought over. If someone doesn't like the direction Bitcoin is going, they can always launch a totally separate altcoin, and let the market decide. Messing with the main chain should be off limits to people who support the core values that bitcoin promises.

Parents are usually right - but not always. 
If you are only talking about say up to $100, and you are OK with loosing it – a real possibility, then I would respectfully suggest going behind their back. Plan on telling them a year later. :)
Here are a few suggestions:
Firstly, buy $10 per week, rather than all in one go. That lets you reduce volatility risk, and also you will be playing with smaller numbers as you get used to things.
I don’t have any experience of parental controls, but if your phone is effectively monitored, you still have some options:
Do you have a PC that is not under surveilance? There are some great PC wallets.
Bitcoin ATMs are great for smaller purchases, and usually have an option to give you a paper wallet directly from the ATM. So you could buy some with no technology at all. Some ATMs do ask for a phone number to send an SMS confirmation code to, but that should not look very suspicious – you could also use a friend’s phone for the SMS if it needs one. It will probably not need one for $10.
Local bitcoins can theoretically be risky – ie meeting a stranger to buy something, so if you go that way choose a public place like a coffee shop or something, and don’t share any personal info. Again, go small -ie $10 at a time. Im sure any reasonable seller will buy you a coffee, and help you through the process, and share some tips.
Finally, if you can set up a wallet somewhere, PM me your public address, and I will send you $1 worth to get you started. You could also post your public address here and see if anyone follows my lead.

Congratulations. 
I definitely don't want this to sound like I am belittling this achievement, but what surprises me is that there are way more people out there with over $100K USD in the stock market who don't own a single bitcoin. At this point I would expect honest financial advisors to be suggesting that wealthy clients buy a single bitcoin. It may still crash and burn, but it is easy to make the case that it is a much better hedge than 'more stocks'.   
Again, serious congratulations. Now keep it quiet, and stashed safely under the mattress.

Fully agree with everyone ripping the 'Expert'. We all have more expertise than most of those interviewed by the MSM.

One point I find amusing, is that people who refer to a lack of "intrinsic value" never bother to look up what it actually means. If you do look it up (try a quick google search), in the context of stocks for example, perceived value, based on future potential (eg hiring a new CEO etc), is a very big part of establishing a stock's intrinsic value. By these measures, bitcoin's intrinsic value is closer to the moon than its current market price. I think this should be our stock response when detractors play the "intrinsic value" card.

So far I have them in an album, but was thinking of a better way to display the collection, and compare them to alternatives - I was thinking of including gold in the comparison somehow. I might post pictures of the work so far at some point.

Many were caused by war funding, but also many were government incompetence, or social commitments, natural disasters or commodity price collapses.

Some folks can't be saved, and probably don't deserve being saved. 
That said, rather than pitching bitcoin, it might be better to just help folks see what is wrong with fiat and traditional banking - ie inflation, government manipulation of interest rates, QE, bank's acting as a point of control, the privacy intrusion of KYC &amp; AML etc.

That is a good model. You can use the hw wallet for large amounts (plug it into your phone or pc to access the funds), and a software wallet on each pc with petty cash. There are many models you can adopt. The best suggestion I can make is to play around with a small amount of funds while finding a model that works for you. But if you have enough bitcoin to worry about, then get a hw wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-24 19:27:32

Not sure why you highlighted that ad. IMHO Huawei is being vilified as part of a trade spat. They invested big in R&amp;D (yes I know their pockets are lined by the Chinese government), and all they are doing is reaping the rewards of their investment. The issue is that most Western companies reduce spending on R&amp;D as a percentage of income when they become bigger and more successful. As for the 5G drama, my uninformed opinion is that a big motive (and funding) for the  upgrade from 4G is to better facilitate government surveillance. So the question is; would you prefer the Chinese government, or the 5 Eyes governments to be watching you. Personally, I prefer the one that is furthest away from me.

Also I don't agree with your comment on selling. I don't measure my assets in local currency. That is part of the point of bitcoin.

If the kidney is in good shape (you don't drink do you?), then at today's rate, you can probably get about 44 bitcoin for one kidney.

No. I based on history (yes, I know - no guide.....), I would expect to see a reduction in volatility as things settle down after the fork drama, and when stability starts to become the norm again, I would expect a gradual price rise as people feel it is safe to enter the water again, and as the halving get closer.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:13:27

My 2c and amateur analysis of this saga is this;
1. Roger was bitcoin jesus, he was a leader, and had a lot invested - financially and psychologically into bitcoin.
2. Roger gets frustrated with the lack of progress on scaling.
3. Roger decides to do something about it to save bitcoin.
4. He saves bitcoin by supporting big blocks. Unfortunately much of the market doesn't appreciate his efforts. He believes he is jesus, so he knows his way is right. They will see in the end.
5. The honey badger moves against him. He starts to feel threatened. He starts to loose money.
6. Now he is cornered, loosing everything, and starting to think that it might not play put the way he expected. It's not his fault. It's everyone else's fault. If everyone bought into his new prophecy, then there wouldn't be a problem. Bitcoin cash would be bitcoin, and all would be well.
7. Fighting for survival and trying to avoid crucifixion,  he lashes out to any interviewer who asks hard questions.
Bitcoin is never dull, and this is where I probably get flamed, but I think his original motive was the health of his vision of bitcoin.
It was us that gave him the jesus title, so I suggest that we don't crucify him, but try to help him find a path back to enlightenment.

No, because when it reaches 20K again, that will probably be the start of the next run to probably 50K - 100K. Also, if you were to sell, what would you do with the proceeds?

Yes, when you talk about inflation in any 1 country, because it devalues that currency against all other currencies, and the price of Bitcoin is influenced by those other currencies. But that doesn't mean the price of Bitcoin will rise much when measured in anything other than Yen.

I never knew that, so I checked: 
"The British pound has its origins in continental Europe under the Roman era. Its name derives from the Latin word "poundus" meaning "weight". The £ symbol comes from an ornate L in Libra. The pound was a unit of currency as early as 775AD in Anglo-Saxon England, equivalent to 1 pound weight of silver."

Now it is 224 British Pounds to 1 pound of silver. That is actually a lot better than I was expecting. I guess that is in part because Britain had the gold standard until 1931. 
I know that the Romans did debase their gold &amp; silver coins though.
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:39:24
A better definition (thank you Wikipedia) is:
Fiat money is a currency established as money by government regulation or law. The term derives from the Latin fiat ("let it become", "it will become") used in the sense of an order or decree. It differs from commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is created from a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange (such a good is called a commodity), while representative money simply represents a claim on such a good.
So Bitcoin can not be considered fiat. I don't think it is commodity or representative money either, but that could be open to debate on the basis that Bitcoin is considered a commodity by some.
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:53:05
You could interpret that to show that when money comes out of the ground, you don't need to print so much of it in order to prop the government up.

@_date: 2017-04-25 22:14:52
....and it is a particularly interesting question when you consider that at the time of the Pizza purchase in 2010, probably every FIAT currency would be on that list. At that time, 1 US$ would buy you about 250 BTC. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any time when 1 US$ would buy 1000 BTC, but I guess before the Pizza that was theoretically the case, as they would have been worth pretty close to zero.

By realizing that although this is painful, it is not unusual when looking at bitcoin price history.

It is very clear to those who have been here for a while, that the type of people who got into crypto during the last year or so are different to those who preceded them. I am keen to see bitcoin go mainstream, so feel it is important to educate more than criticize these folks. I hope that does not sound patronizing. What we need are people like Andreas who also have the ability to connect to the non geek / non financially savvy community.

Don't try to time the market, just buy small amounts regularly over time, but never more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:40:32
A hardware wallet or even a free software wallet (eg Mycelium) will solve this, and is really the way that you should be holding your bitcoin. With either, you are not at risk of exchanges going out of business, or any other issues you may encounter with them. It is important to realize though that your personal wallet is 100% your own responsibility. Loose it, or loose access to it, and you loose the coins forever, so back it up somewhere safe (just follow the wallet instructions for this). Hardware wallets are much more secure (eg Ledger or Trezor) than software wallets, but cost more, so it all comes down to how much bitcoin you have. Leaving bitcoin on an exchange has proven many times to be a very bad idea....
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:50:15
I think there is a decent chance that this is right. If not as soon as it comes back online, at least quite likely after the dust starts to settle.

It obviously is by definition, or miners wouldn't mine. There are many things that use much more energy that people never question, such as banks IT infrastructure to support KYC &amp; AML, or many areas of government waste.

It would depend on many factors. If the crisis was because of fiat printing, and bitcoin was having some good press at the time, then bitcoin would do very well, IMHO.

There is a fine line between censorship and valid moderation. In the end, it comes down to the professionalism and personal opinion of the mod. I have had posts removed that I couldn't see anything wrong with, so I get where the complaints are coming from, but my vote would be for the mods to immediately delete &amp; block posts from the negative haters that don't add any value ("going to zero" brigade), but to totally allow negative posts if they have something of value to add to the conversation.
I have started doing my part by reporting trolling posts to the mods. I encourage others to do likewise.

Its going great! Lightening is expanding fast. Regulators are taking a reasonable line (for the most part). Lots of resiliency tests have proved the technology &amp; reward mechanism.

The BCH firework show has deflected atention from what is important. All the reasons that I got into bitcoin 5 years ago are more valid now than they ever were. Global debt is out of control. Central banks are out of control. Bitcoin is more relavent now than when Satoshi pasted the text from The Times of London into the Genesis block.
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:35:21
One other reason that is often overlooked about the usefulness of bitcoin is the education that it gives to anyone who spends time to seriously research it. This IMHO is no small thing. It opens eyes &amp; gateways to  knowledge &amp; understanding that is hard to come by through other means.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:08:31

This goes together with the recent senate hearing, where it was clear that the SEC viewed many ICOs as securities. They were also clear that bitcoin was not a security. This is a non issue for bitcoin. 
You can watch the full hearing here:

That is because this is about securities (which is what the SEC has jurisdiction over). The SEC was very clear in the recent senate hearing that some ICOs are securities in their eyes.

Correct. We don't know. We do however know that the recent price drop is not unusual compared to bitcoin's historic volatility. I don't see anyone referring to previous crashes as 'proof' of anything - just giving some context.
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:23:08
I think it goes wider than that. I would say that KYC &amp; AML, while for 'good reasons' are forms of government over ambition and control. The old established rules of law seem to have been eroded bit by bit in a post Sept 11 world. What has it to do with the banks or the governments how we choose to spend our money? Having to answer AML questions to move our own money is a form of censorship &amp; control. Concepts like innocent until proven guilty, the need for warrants or court orders before snooping into people's lives etc all seem to be things of the past. They have been replaced by civil asset forfeiture, KYC, AML and turning a blind eye to the occasional murder of a journalist or 2.

Because bitcoin is not a debt based currency unlike fiat. This point shows why that matters.
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:27:38
I struggled with that for a long time. I agree that it is kind of priced in, but I also believe that an unusual supply and demand balance is at play. My hypothesis is that the demand side is mostly set in fiat - "I want to buy $300 of bitcoin", and that the supply side is mostly set in bitcoin - "I want to sell .5 bitcoin". This interplay means that a drop in supply (a halvening) might have more impact than the market in general has priced in. I welcome any views on this hypothesis.

@_date: 2018-11-25 13:00:28
Not sure if you are being sarcastic, but that is exactly what has happened several times already. The absolute number is not relevant, only the percentage matters. I am not trying to make any predictions, but the recent drop from $20,000 to $3800 is in no way unusual when looking at the historical timeline. If the big numbers fool you into thinking differently, stop measuring the price of bitcoin, and start measuring the price of Satoshis. (right now 1 Satoshi = .0038 US cents).

Good analysis. Probably as good a growth forecast as you could do based on past price analysis, and halvings etc. What it misses of course, like all predictions, are any unexpected step changes that might occur - eg any tipping points in adoption, or any new regulatory hurdles etc. That said, great job, and better than 99% of price predictions out there.

I tend to think there is a motive behind posts like " *I think we hit $1200-$1500 by....*". It seems like an attempt to influence price for some advantage - like shorting, or seeing bitcoin as a threat etc.

@_date: 2017-09-13 03:01:28
It seems so. I think the recent price rise brought in many new bitcoiners, who have not been through previous turmoils, and they are very easily spooked. As for the JD statement, I would see that as a big positive. We are on his radar. As for China, if the rumor is true (which I doubt), then the facts will not be as big of an issue as the rumor effect is having on the price. So just HODL, get some popcorn, and watch the action.

Yes he could. Yes he would know. Don't know if any one would use it though.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:08:53
Definitely. 
I get hanahookie's point about what inflation is, and he is right, but there is also the wealth re-distribution effect at play.
Higher minimum wage is a form of wealth re-distribution. Those who have more than they need (eg the 1%) do not increase their spending by the same proportion if they are given more wealth. So a higher minimum wage increases the amount of money being spent, which does cause inflation. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 06:43:58

@_date: 2017-09-15 09:03:45
Yes. It is over reaction to events in China coupled with a pull back given the massive recent rise. When there is a big rise, it pulls in many noobs. These noobs have not been through previous volatility, and are easily spooked, and thus sell.

I don't like to give advice, but having been through a few of these cycles, I would suggest that noobs try to ignore the price and just HODL. Markets are cyclical, and I am confident that we will see much higher highs in the future. Don't try to time the market. Just HODL. Now that some clarity is emerging regarding the China situation, it is likely that the worst is behind.

Yes. It is over reaction to events in China coupled with a pull back given the massive recent rise. When there is a big rise, it pulls in many noobs. These noobs have not been through previous volatility, and are easily spooked, and thus sell.

@_date: 2017-09-08 17:09:50
That is a well worded version of a common question. There are many things that markets value, which don't earn money in the form of dividends or interest. Think of the price of eggs etc. 
So how do you put a value on it? The best method is to compare it to other assets or markets - eg x% of the value of all gold in existence, or y% of the international transfer market etc. There is a handy calculator somewhere out there that lets you play various scenarios. I will try to find the link for it shortly.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:31:14

I fully agree. I was expecting to get flamed for both posts, the one here, and the one 'over there', but on balance, I seem to have received mostly positive responses from both sides (including Reddit Gold status &amp; $8 worth of tips :)). That tells me that most folks on both sides are reasonable, and want to heal the divide - at least the personal one, if not the philosophical or technical one.

No don't!
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:24:01
There is some truth in what you say, however the reason that I ventured over there in the first place was that I was getting tiered of seeing personal attacks over here, so lets clean our own house, and let them do what the will. As for 'begging', I can see your point. That said, my intent was to try to avoid being roasted, which is what I expected given all the posts on here about r/btc, hence the tone. I wouldn't call that begging.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:46:17
The fact that you can list the flamers proves my point. There is a vocal, but small minority on both forums that prefer to attack, than to debate. They need politely sidelining in favor of those who apply reasoned debate.
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:31:19
Come on. Lets be better than that.
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:30:03
I'm not sure that analysis is correct. While it is true that on the surface, Japanese people are in favor of central control - particularly government control, I am not sure that is a complete picture. There are some very smart people in Japan, who outwardly comply with social pressure to conform,  but inwardly reject a lot of the assumed norms and social stupidity. I believe that Fukushima changed a lot of people attitudes, which is not always visible on the surface. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:47:25
My take is not to worry about a China exchange ban at all. The effect of a negative rumor on price is nearly always worse than the actual news - markets hate uncertainty (buy the rumor, sell the news). This goes for stocks, bitcoin, or pretty much anything. Bitcoin is always volatile, and there could be a price drop, but long term I am very bullish. If there is a drop, just continue hodling, and all will be well in the end. That is how quite a few folks got rich here, and these issues are small in the grand scheme of things. Bitcoin has been through far worse.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:21:31
I recall reading that as well. If true, it is not so weird at all. Hal could easily have come across his neighbor's name somewhere, and appropriated it from the beginning. That might also explain why even in the last few months of his life, he felt the need to rescue DN.

I remember. It was an excellent post, and has aged very well. The predictions were far better than any CNBC experts, thus, obviously proving its authenticity. 
Careful analysis shows the only incorrect prediction was the $1000 in 2015 - it actually happened in 2014, so a few months early. Either he got his history mixed up, or more likely, his post accelerated the timeline. Interestingly he was back on target with the $10,000 by 2017 prediction. Next checkpoint is $100,000 in 2019.

This is 100% correct, and would be most noticed in the price of high price items - particularly housing and cars, where debt is basically assumed. I cringe every time i hear a car showroom advert. They nearly always get in a phrase or 2 about "bad credit OK" etc. Why not just buy a car you can afford dummy. If you use credit to buy a depreciating asset, that is dumb IMHO.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:28:18
I do. I remember a heated email exchange with Mt Gox customer service about some account issues that prevented me buying before the price spike. Couldn't get in until it hit 13. I was furious about it. Funny thing was, the emails were signed Mark Karpelès. Had no idea who he was at the time of course. Sad part is that because I missed the price explosion to 13, and didn't want to buy at the peak, I only bought about 1BTC to experiment with :(
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:51:14
Miners sell a large portion of the new coins to pay for electricity and new hardware. New coins are thus a large percentage of the supply on the market. If supply falls by 50%, and nothing else in the system changes (which is not realistic), then you would expect a doubling of price. That is an over simplification of course - you need to factor in sentiment, news coverage, market pricing in the halving etc.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:10:32
That is not a risk that I would take. Bear in mind that no-one had heard from SN for years, nor had the coins been moved before the "I am not DN" post came out.
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:50:41
I will look into that. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:26:22
This is a non-issue - see above, or watch the recent senate hearing where the SEC chairman is very clear that the SEC only considers certain ICOs as securities. Bitcoin was specifically stated not to be a security. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:30:31
Well that may be the case, but do we really understand their basic point of view?
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:07:53
There are 2 types of people on here, those that bitcoined through previous dips or crashes, and those who haven't. Anyone who sold during previous dips sorely regrets it now. You will not be able to time the market, and will probably loose a sizable percentage of your stash.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:44:00
That is fair, as long as they attack the argument, not me. Also, I'm not sure that there is much poking to do. There are some surprisinly diverse views on that forum, and most folks actually agree with us on more things than they disagree on.

Even so, it doesn't matter. When Gox went down, bitcoin didn't die. Long term it was a good thing - compare the price now &amp; then. This time we now have diversified exchanges all over the world. At that time Gox was practically the only exchange. Also, remember that the Chinese are pretty inventive, and even with capital controls will probably find ways to use overseas exchanges.

Thanks. Good link. Anyone know what the status of any replay protection implementation is?

This is an important point. You don't have to be an anarchist or extremist to realize the value of an asset that governments can't control in order to get re-elected in 4 years time. Even if not widely adopted, it is a check &amp; balance against monetary inflation and government's over ambition.

Yes 4% fees = 4 Euros.
Bitcoin ATMs vary, but usually they have a choice for how you collect the BTC. They typically will either transfer it to your wallet - you scan your wallet's QR code at the ATM, or it will print you a paper wallet that you can sweep to your own wallet later.

There is nothing official yet , but I suspect something is a foot. That said, it will not be as bad as the rumors. Rumors always have a bigger negative impact on prices than actual facts. Markets don't like uncertainty.
I wouldn't be surprised to see a tightening of regulations, but maybe staying short of an outright ban. That seems to be the hint being given if you read the various sources carefully. This might cause many exchanges to close, but I wouldn't be surprised to see some finding a way to stay open.

Well that might be true, but I will try to respond as I have here, i.e. don't give or accept personal attacks, but argue the issues with an open mind. Folks who don't respect that approach don't deserve to be listened to - whether on this forum, or that.

How will you handle the word text file before you encrypt it? How will you create the file - will you type on a keyboard?
I would write the seed words on paper - with a pen, and make a few copies by hand. Then rip them each into 2 or 3 parts and store each piece in secure, but different locations, such that even if you can't recover all pieces, you can recover a full seed set.
Or you could just keep your coins on a Trezor, create 2 or 3 backup Trezors,  then destroy all paper seed backups and store the Trezors in different places.

I agree to a point, but as per my post to another comment in this thread, I think main stream adoption is a journey, not a destination.

Basically yes. ETFs can either hold the physical asset (as this one proposes) - in which case bitcoin will be bought and sold OTC or on exchanges to keep close to the 100&amp; backing. There are also ETFs called synthetic ETFs that simulate the price of an asset. This is usually done through futures.

It reads like a machine translation from Chinese. That said, it is hardly surprising that most people invest in crypto without "professional financial advice", as the professional financial advisers can't typically make money by recommending crypto, unlike their kickback based funds.

I don't think anyone buys that CSW is SN, however there is one thing that continues to puzzle me;
When Dorian Nakamoto was 'outed' by Newsweek, Someone with SN's keys came to his rescue with the famous "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" message. With that background, faking being SN would be very stupid, as you would likely be called out by the real SN - unless you somehow knew that wasn't going to happen.
So I wonder if CSW was in some way connected to SN, or at least knew who he was, and therefore knew that he would not be able to respond for some reason. 
This suggests to me that SN is probably dead, both by the fact that he didn't weigh in on the CSW claim, and that CSW didn't expect him to. 
Obviously, that fits the Hal Finney hypothesis well. Does anyone have any evidence that CSW had links to Hal?

I doubt that they will completely stop you from trading bitcoin, and am sure that even if they do, they will not force you to sell what you have. Hodling will probably be fine. There is usually only an issue is if there is some genuine conflict - e.g. if you own shares in a company that they are advising, or involved in some kind of corporate action with, so unless your employer is trading bitcoin, I doubt they will have an issue. My guess is that they will just want an annual compliance statement from you.

Not only the influx of capital, but after the initial frenzy dies down, my belief is that the effective increase in liquidity will do a great deal to reduce volatility, making it viable for bitcoin to really be seen as a currency or stable asset. That said, for a while after any ETF launch we can expect some crazy volatility - possibly exceeding anything we have seen so far. .....and yes LN (or a working scaling solution) is also vitally important.

Great question. The only issue with the BigMac coin is the counter party risk of McDonalds. If they go bust, or they decide not to honor the coins for some reason (read the ts &amp; cs), then they are not worth much. That said, they seem a pretty sound version of money compared to fiat. I would probably accept them as money personally as long as there is no expiry date on them. It reminds me of the Moscow underground tokens which briefly circulated as a fiat substitute.

Actually, I had thought about this before , and I agree there is an issue here. However it is an issue that has been faced before with other sound money systems (gold etc).
The answer is quite simple.....
It is basically an economy not based entirely on credit. When loans are made, the interest has to reflect the true risk (including the systemic risk you describe). You would likely see very wide ranges of interest rates depending upon the risk, but loans would be the exception, not the rule. The economy would depend on savings, not credit. This is a good thing IMHO. The seeming need for "extra currency" would come from other loans that default.
The real problem's start when businesses become custodians of other peoples bitcoin, and eventually move to a fractional reserve system as the Italian goldsmiths did in the 1700s.

I do not believe it is the same as previously filed. This time they have addressed the investor risk through the insurance component, and custodial aspects, and have defined how they will address liquidity concerns - by buying through OTC markets. It is being billed as a partnership with the CBOE. I agree that the CBOE filing is for the necessary rule change.

There are different types of ETFs. Those backed by the physical asset, and 'synthetic' ones, which are not. The one proposed is backed by real bitcoin (does that make it a physical bitcoin ETF????). These are not good for market manipulation, but are good for increasing liquidity, which is needed to reduce volatility. I am all for it.

I was thinking of starting a thread, but found this thread was leaning in the same direction as my own thoughts. I believe it really is different from 2013. My logic is this; the price is determined by the supply demand ratio (obviously). On the demand side, the network effect is fundamentally exponential - as it was in 2013. However on the supply side, there are 2 big differences - firstly the new coin production is half what it was in 2013, and secondly, a bigger ratio of hodlers have held bitcoin for a length of time (ie through previous boom &amp; bust cycles). Long term hodlers are far less likely to panic sell than noobe bitcoiners. My take is that this boom or bubble (I am ok to call it that) will not drop back to anything like the percentage of peak that we saw in 2013. In fact I think we will see upward movement resume before this run comes to an end.

It supports the bitcoin merchant, it supports the cafes that choose to have BTMs, and it supports the BTM network (yes I know the BTM exchange rates are a rip off, but if you use purse for the purchase, you can offset that with the discount - and also support purse!).

That article is flawed in practically every paragraph. The author clearly does not have a clue about the subject: 
"Supply is thought to be increasing at a 4% annual clip, around half the previous rate" - really - "THOUGHT to".
It states that the variation in price by country is related to the limited supply of bitcoin - the variation in price by country is 100% due to friction in the the fiat system between each country, making arbitrage difficult.
But the bit I love is the claim that bitcoin can't be valued, as there is no dividend. That would go for gold too, and errr.... wait that would also go for any currency with 0% interest like erm... the Japanese Yen, and pretty much most Western currencies since 2008.
Shame, as the Nikkei is usually quite respected. Shame on them for publishing this rubbish. They should reach out to some Redditors to write their next article.

I assume you are talking about the price. If so, don't think about the last six months. Look at the chart from 2009 through to today, ideally as a log chart. All that is happening now is the inevitable continuation of what was set in motion 10 years ago. Read "The Bitcoin Standard", and understand that Bitcoin is the hardest form of money that mankind has had to date. The price at any point in time is just a function of Metcalf's law and Gresham's law. Google them if you are not familiar with these laws.

The daily discussion thread accounts for 90% of the problem. Maybe it is time to kill the thread off, and rely on Reddit's normal algorithms to let the hot topics float to the top. That is how it worked until relatively recently, and we also have the chat rooms now, so there really is no need for the daily thread IMHO - it just acts as a troll magnet.

Agreed. That said, it does help to understand some of the other comments round here. The 'quality' of the bitcon community is not what it was. Many of the latest round of bitcoiners need a bit more time to understand and get educated. The good thing is that bitcoin is a great educator.

That is a great initiative. Do keep it going.  I think it will show a valuable trend. Bitcoin is a peer to peer currency, not  a b2c currency. This is an important  way to chart acceptance, and could evolve into a really useful tool.

Stock answers that do not stand up to scrutiny. 
1. I am not a gold bug, but you can make a reasonable case that gold has been extremely stable over thousands of years. The so called volatility comes mostly from fiat devaluation. Looking at gold price in terms of purchasing power, it is surprisingly stable.
2. Gold does have some limited uses, but that is pretty irrelevant to it's value. All of its uses can be well served by other materials.

And the fun bit is that this will repeat. Those 'laggards'  that came to get rich will sell at the bottom of the bear market, and get burned. The laggards that take (or took) time to understand what bitcoin was created for will hang around, and become the future early adopters. Bitcoin is one of the few things that rewards engineers, intelligence, self study,  and the understanding of technology. Many things in life seem to reward sheep, sports fans, marketing executives, salesmen, people who have an elevator pitch, or a go-to-market strategy (whatever one of those is).

Multiple free speech focused alternatives to Patreon could be bitcoin's killer app. Developers, please see this as a call to action. I don't agree with some of the comments below, stating that it is not needed as artists can accept bitcoin directly, as not everyone is set up to donate bitcoin yet. Multiple competing professional sites that accept bitcoin as well as other payment channels would be in heavy demand right now.  Patreon does far more than handle payments, it enables content searches, hosts content etc. These are not things that bitcoin does on its own.

Don't be put off by other's comments. Arbitrage is a tried and tested way of making money. In mature market's such as forex, there is very little to be made, and in immature markets such as bitcoin, there is usually a reason others are not doing it at scale, thus removing the opportunity. However, (and this is an important point), as an expert in a specialist field (you qualify for that description), it is often possible to find arbitrage opportunities that others are not fully exploiting. I did this 5 year's ago, and found non-USD markets to be the best. Look at CAD, GBP etc.

I don't have a problem with the fact that it is a centralized intermediary, although directly accepting merchants would be much better. Until we get wider direct adoption, what we really need are a number of competing services like this to bring the 7% to 12% fee down.

Here is probably the closest thing you will get to a straight answer; It depends entirely on utilization, and its ability to nibble away at conventional assets. There is a fabulous tool over at   that let's you plug in a few variables, and it will calculate the per coin price based on your estimates. When I use the tool with my best estimates, I get about $20k. That is a figure that I have held as what i consider a realistic target since 2013 - ie well before the momentary 20k market spike last year.
