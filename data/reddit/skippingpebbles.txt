Well for starters there's a maximum number of coins i.e. a few bit cents off 21 million. So it's partially a question of supply Vs demand. ~7.6 billion people in the world—that's not much supply vs a lot of potential demand.
Secondly, people are not only buying bit coin because of the rapid price increase, but also to avoid banks which have a reputation, for example following the sub-prime mortgage / financial crash. Lastly, if you compare with other things that have a high value e.g. gold. Gold is not easy to transfer. Shipping can take weeks and it's at risk of being stolen plus it's  expensive to store large quantities. Thousands of Bit coins can be stored on a USB stick. Gold still holds value because of supply Vs demand. It's worth mentioning that gold doesn't have a intrinsic value, it only does because as a society we decide that it does. 
It's the same for bit coin. It looks to me that bit coin will be a long term investment, that people will hodl and continue to invest in.
Imo Lite coins and other alt coins are likely to be used for rapid transactions for physical / online purchases.

Yes but most gold isn't used for any purpose it's just sat in bank vaults in kg bars. When alternatives to gold are developed like graphene, biological chips etc then gold won't lose it's value. Same with diamonds super useful for drills numerous other applications but they're ubiquitous. Only worth a high value as supply and demand are controlled. With bitcoin there is a relatively low maximum 21 mill.
