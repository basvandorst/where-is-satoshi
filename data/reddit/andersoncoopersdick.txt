Most of that 50% cost comes goes to cover this advertisement, costs from running this campaign, and the car that it looks like someone is going to win. Its not from the currency being used.

Okay, So it would be capital gains if I convert it back to USD. 
How about if instead of purchasing $2000 with the 10 BTC I have in the above scenario, I purchase $2000 worth of goods using BTC. That should not be taxed correct?
Edit: Sorry, I just read the link you posted and that answered my question. Thanks.

Assume the economy grows at an exponential rate. That is, if it generally grows at an rate of 3% per year, this means the equation of the size of the economy is approximately:
y =  C*(1.03)^x. For some constant C.
taking the log of y gives: log(y) = a*x + b which is the equation for a line, lines are more intuitive to interpret. 
(NB: in this case a = log(1.03), b=log(C))

Is this because it increases the scarcity of BTC or does it benefit the rest of the world because they are somehow recovered? What if over time as people keep "losing BTC" eventually all the Bitcoins are lost? 
(Note: I know I sound like an idiot here, my understanding of how bitcoins work is probably completely wrong.)

That is not true at all. See [this]( documentary if you're interested in electric car's first rise and fall. [(Video Link Here)](
