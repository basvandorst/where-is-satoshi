now here is the real kicker thought. bitcoin our revolutionary  savior... lol. if gov issued fiat falls apart.. what do you think will happen to the crypto value.. u know the crypto that was bought and paid for with gov issued ponzi fiat. 
what bitcoin's real value is.. bitcoin has the ability for the average person to profit on the greatest ponzi scheme ever made... fractional reserve lending

USD is the biggest ponzi scheme in the history of ponzi schemes, the only reason us goes to war with countries is because they dont use USD to trade, which marks them as an asset ok to be exploited without hurting the USA's economy

you are right they are idiots. banks are only required to hold 10% so out of 1000$ deposit they can loan out 9000$ and maintain their reserve ratio..

oh and for someone so edumacated how is it u do not know that the price is normalized across exchanges through arbitrage bots via api access? that being said gdax does allow api access why is theirs still higher? magic i guess.

My first reaction was to call you stupid and walk away. However, you are probably not stupid, just ignorant and lazy. Take time to educate yourself about a subject before you offer advice. Let me let you in on a secret which will help you. It's the holidays so I'm feeling magnanimous. Day traders are all hodlers first. We never touch our bitcoin. We do however take margin positions out when it's an obvious buy or short. So if we were day trading our own bitcoin we would under perform the market... However we don't, so we get standard bitcoin gains + a little extra. 45% dip? Lost half of my cash buffer which was only 10%... Bought back in on the reversal 3 times at 3.3x margin with 2 shorts  in between that. So this dip, irked my bitcoin dropped 45% in value but increased my bitcoin holdings 37%. The goal is to keep the balance in cash buffer until a dip then you convert it.
Moral of the story ? You've been missing out on easy coins because you let others on here convince you of mindless hodl. Educate yourself. You'll never get ahead doing what everyone else is doing. 
Edit-- most people don't/can't day trade because it's tedious and requires tremendous self control, focus and time commitment. The analysis is the easy part, It's the sitting in front of 3 monitors watching candle graphs and indicators 14 hours a day 7 days a week that is difficult. Hence the lazy accusation.

They aren't making money on trading fees... its 0% on limit orders. Coinbase makes their money on skimming, inflating the price during bull on up swings and deflating the price on downswings, and also their 2% price adjustment on buys and withdraws. Use a real exchange like bitfinex, your mind will be blown and you will feel very ashamed you thought coinbase was an exchange. Don't let their bit licenses or their claim that they are the largest exchange in america fool you, they are crooks. The largest exchange by volume by predominantly english speakers is bitfinex(4x coinbase)... coinbase's platform is laughable compared to bitfinex... they know this that's why they pay many shills to extoll coinbase and smear bitfinex.  Open up other exchanges and compare to coinbase... you will be able to tell who is the fraud. Notice how coinbase gets stuck on odd numbers 9245 or something... while most other exchanges NEVER get stuck if so only for a minute or less and always at a nice round number 9400 or 9390.  That's when they are doing the skim. Their orderbook is fake, they skim and place their own orders first.
