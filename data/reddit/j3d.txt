Also for those wondering about alternatives, I've only had great experiences with CampBX. They're based in the US and also work with Dwolla (not sure if things will eventually affect them) but at least for now you could send btc to campbx and then withdraw to Dwolla if you wanted. CBX accounts are pretty easy to set up too.

CampBX has a "Spend-x trade" option now where you can do just that. click the "tradenow" tab. underneath of the quick buy/sell boxes you can specify buy with x amount of USD.

I used them years ago and they were awesome. They are back as of March 18, 2013 but it seems like they are more geared towards professional investors now. You can "request more information" on their page but I don't know if they are really geared for individual trading.

I got verified in about 10 days but that was a couple months ago where I STARTED at about 9000 in the queue so it's probably longer now. Once you're verified, Dwolla deposits usually happen within the same day.

I don't think it's too long.  I believe it's usually within a couple days.

yep same two I use, but I am going towards only using cbx to even the centralization of mtgox

Yep. The ATI Radeon cards are way better for mining because of the architecture of the cards. But at this point, GPU mining is definitely not worth the energy costs for running them. With the ASIC hardwares starting to appear, GPU mining will become obsolete.
As for everything else, you're on the right track. But I am with the crowd who says NEVER hold all of your coins in an online wallet as it is not as secure as a local (or even paper wallet). For Bitcoin-Qt, make sure you go to File-&gt;backup wallet which will give you a wallet.dat file that you should keep as secure as possible. I keep mine on an encrypted external drive.

Definitely. I switched from Mtgox to campbx about a month ago and I'm very happy with my experience so far. It also now the 4th largest exchange after the closing of bitfloor.

Ah I see. Well i am currently using campbx and i have lived it so far. You can transfer from dwolla without any verification but a non verified account can only move $1000 a day. And campbx is now the 4th largest exchange I believe. I'd like to see Mt gox not be so centralized so campbx is an awesome alternative.

Do you have a verified Mt gox account? Why not just transfer from dwolla with a Mt gox deposit?
