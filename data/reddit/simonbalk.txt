Yes. The post was made at the office and this is my personal account. Sorry if unclear but didn't want to wait with replying to questions till tomorrow ;)
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:56:26
That's correct
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:35:03
Thank you for summing that up.

Depends on the definition of a pornographer :) we run FreeOnes the porn site. If that makes one a pornographer than yes we are.

Engrish  is not my first language but I'm doing my best ;)
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:13:26
That's actually a good question which I'll address tomorrow. It's a partnership we run so have to talk this over first. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:34:19
It only makes sense to add it. Lmk if you need help setting it up.

I would say that's one of the biggest myths in adult. People actually do care about their cc statements specially the last few years with the economy being so bad and people being more aware of their sendings. 
Of course you have people forgetting to cancel but that's not what most revenue is coming from. 
Ps keep in mind we are a free site mostly promoting pay sites. We get a commission on every sale but we don't really run pay sites ourself.

Bit pay was extremely easy to integrate into our website FreeOnes.com

1. Yes since today. There is a post about it here too
2. Cams might come later. Right now you can buy myFreeOnes credit packages. 
3. My bad

Spendings not sendings. Damn auto correct again ;)

I feel the same way about drm on porn sites. It punishes the legimate buyers. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:11:02
Believe it or not but there are still lots of people paying for porn. If you offer a good product and a good user experience then people are still willing to pay. 
Yes there is a lot of free porn on the tubes and yes a lot of people got screwed over when they used their credit card, no need to deny that bit we do our best to get at least a little bit of trust back. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:29:35
Exactly and we are aware of these issues. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:36:04
No problem
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:28:02
I do know MetArt is offering the option too. Since we work closely we looked into it all and added it as we'll. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:12:38
Time will tell. At least some companies are showing not to be against it and I think that should give the industry a bit of credit. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:38:51
Good point. Or 2 actually haha
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:20:12
We used to be an innovator but now the adult industry is mostly a follower. Not sure if we've seen the light but its a step into the right direction I think ;)
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:11:45
We are on it so give it some time please :)
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:40:22
Thank you
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:28:36
As well, not as we'll 
Damn auto correction
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:27:11
As stated we run a big adult free site mostly pornstar based. One of the paid parts though features photos and videos uploaded by models themselfs and in exchange for credits users can buy this content. And as of now we offer bitcoin as a payment option. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:41:22
We are actually planning an AMA soon :)
