Yesterday I was thinking that it might be easy to get Manchin on bitcoin's side by setting up a PAC or Super PAC for him that takes donations in bitcoins. That way, he's got an interest in them. I tweeted the idea to Marc Andreessen, and he favorited the tweet, so he may think there's some value to that. 
There's a couple problems with this though. 1. Manchin isn't up for re-election until 2018. He's not in dire need of support at this point. 2. It's probably not just Manchin that dislikes bitcoins. My guess is that it's a significant portion of the Senate Banking Committee, and that the Committee chose Manchin to give the statement because he's from a small state with an older population. He would have the least to lose from his constituents by making a public statement against cryptocurrency. The SPAC would probably have to benefit the entire Committee to be truly effective. 3. We would be rewarding bad behavior. When politicians realize all they have to do to get a SPAC that supports them to spring up is to speak up against bitcoin, it could incite more negative comments. There may have to be a creative solution to keep this from happening.
Does anyone have any thoughts?

Wow, I completely glanced over the first child comment. Yes, you make perfect sense. It's been a long day.

"Would you have listened to me then?" 
I tell my friends that now probably is at or near a low point for bitcoin and that the further away we get from Gox fiasco, the better for the perception and price of bitcoin, but they are still hesitant.

I think you're overestimating the knowledge of the general public.

Fair enough. However, I think that's easier said than done. Federal politicians are very entrenched. Few ideologues, many people that respond to money.

While it may also mean "hold on for dear life" now, that was not how the term was created. As you've probably read in other responses, it was originally a misspelling of hold.
