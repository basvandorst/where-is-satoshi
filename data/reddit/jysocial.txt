This was the thinking in 2013.

Yes. Bitcoin had been in the news a lot coming up to the 2013 crash, big companies had just started to adopt and the news was looking very positive. Maybe it will be different this time, only time will tell. I think expecting the current growth trend to continue is pretty naive tho.

There's no incentive for any company to do this, they have no stake in whether bitcoin catches on or not.

I just go to localbitcoins.com and use their escrow to buy coins. But thats just me.

They havent been proven as yet no. They have shown that they have BFL pre-orders, and they are also a mining pool, but other than that, you would have to wait until they start paying dividends to know if they are legit.

The problem with bitcointalk is that people throw around scam accusations without going through channels to get their issue resolved. People jump the gun a lot.
As always I'd suggest waiting to see if people get dividends before you invest.

They haven't started mining yet, they start June 20 from memory, using Avalon gear. I have had a couple of contacts with them, asking about time frames and asking to change my payout address. That was before their big website redevelopment.
If you're worried they might be scamming people you might want to wait until after June 20 to see if people who have contracts start to get paid or not.

When I lost bets with SatoshiDice I would get a small amount back, if I win i get the larger amount back.
Sometimes it takes a while for anything to come back - up to 40 minutes sometimes for me.

I have a bridge I'd like to sell you

Theres a thread on bitcointalk  but thats the only one I know of.
Another option is Hashrack.com Im currently saving my coins to get a contract there too
@_date: 2013-06-16 10:17:37
I would be very interested in this

I have a couple of contracts with cloudhashing, and I have talked to them a few times via email. From what I can see they seem to be legit. The are waiting on orders from BFL, but they also have Avalon orders in and are organizing to buy a bunch of ASICminer gear too
Edit: They have a newsletter if that helps

If you are in Australia you can use Coinjar.io and deposit money at any NAB branch

Luckily all my bitcoins are locked in bitfunder where I cant access them because I have no access to a scanner. All I can do is watch my stocks slowly dwindle to worthlessness.
Take that hackers!

Cloudhashing dividends are paid fortnightly. If you get an indefinite contract they keep a percentage for buying more hardware to keep your investment profitable for longer. If I recall correctly they are going to open up more contracts soon for a bunch of hardware they are planning to buy in September.
Note: This is all theoretical until they can be proven reliable

I think probably eBay would be your best bet, or possibly list them on Bitcointalk.org in this child board 
Good luck!

I already have a bunch of btc invested with you in BTCInvest, you really do a great job! Definitely trying this out! My link is:

I bought 1 bitcoin worth of shares at .0008 (about 1500). Considering cashing out but I'm a bit indecisive - especially as they have just brought 3 avalons online. 
Aw heck, it's only 1 bitcoin, I'm staying!
