This is bad. Only enables the scamming of the old or ignorant

Well this is just wrong but even if it was true, is that really what you want to happen?

Water is wet. Did it really take this genius this long to figure out their business model?

There’s a reason why people who know the basics of candle patterns do better. Not only that but there’s other ways to analyze trends besides just staring at a graph. As is evident, most people aren’t willing to put in that much effort

This ain’t complicated. I’m not decreasing my ratio. Sell high buy low. It’s not rocket science. Anytime prices change by 15% you know that there’s gonna be a shift coming soon. If you’re feeling confident in your TA you can even short

If you guys sold every time it peaked and bought every time it dipped instead of holding, you wouldn’t have to have these pity parties like retards. It’s not about either short term or long term gains when you can have both

By your logic, I sold at 9k and am now buying way cheaper, thus setting up for making a profit. Sit down and shut up you fucking brainlet
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:15:53
Yeah that’s what I was referring to haha

Y’all are straight up retarded

Whenever it goes above 7500, in about a month. It’s not that hard TJ set limits for yourself to minimize loss. I’m not saying I’m an investing god. Please do your own research and you can come to your own conclusions. Start at investopedia

That’s the way

95% of people here are brain dead. How is your only strategy to hold and wait for the best.  There’s a sucker born every minute
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:02:54
Duh lmao.  But no for real you can tell trends. You know it’s not gonna stay at this same price and the cycles have gotten predictable enough
