They mostly operate as an in person bitcoin exchange, host events and provide co-
working space to developers.  
I work out of La Maison du Bitcoin.  Our projects are btcReport (iOS app) and Coinhive.io (unreleased).  While working there, I notice people coming in throughout the day to trade and/or talk bitcoin.  Additionally there's a lot of press coming through.
All in all, it's a cool place to work!

This is great!  I also think there's lots of innovation in building industry specific applications on the blockchain, especially when targeting specific markets.
It's similar to a spec that I've been working on for artists/musicians (and need help with) : 
However, with playcoin, miners can earn coins by collecting 'download fees' for hosting content while the owner of the content is paid directly.  The idea is to create economic incentive NOT to pirate.

BTW - btcReport was recently used as a 'use case' at the BTC2B Conference in Brussels.  We released some of our stats within the talk.

One of the early iOS bitcoin ticker apps, since 2011.  It supports 30+ markets and 25+ currencies.  It's focused is on using good design to target the mass audience with simple and clear presentation of data.

I'm the original developer and my partner from HandsomeCode.com is the designer. We had 3rd developer help us out earlier this year.

We'd like to release one soon, as well as Windows Mobile.

I'm still waiting for my Trezor to arrive but I own a Ledger.  
I personally know the guys (I live in Paris) who developed Ledger.  They are very competent and have built a really nice product.  
As a software developer, I look forward to them releasing the API for connecting to the device.

They announced a new realtime trading platform: rtbtc.com

I'm product designer for Paymium and a few weeks back we launched a product called: Instawire.org
Simply send a SEPA transfer with your bitcoin address (or first bits) in the comments section of your transfer and we'll send you btc when it clears.

There's also instawire.org if you can to do a SEPA transfer (BTC/EUR).

Thanks for noticing!  We're pretty stoked to have released it so close behind the release of iOS6.  
Because of legal issues with virtual currencies, Apple can't sell bitcoin wallets on the app store.  However, with the passbook pass we're as close as ever to having realtime balance updates on iOS.
You can still send from your mobile phone using the same instawallet on Safari.  We'll have another update soon that will support QR code scanning.

In this proof of concept, we explored using the blockchain as a digital notary.  The concept is "microinsurance" which involves short insurance contracts.  
We leveraged the Bitcoin blockchain's ability to timestamp and notarize the steps for ownership, transfer and return of the item.  With these "facts" recorded in a public ledger, the insurance company has a public record of when to start/stop the contract.  
In a fully featured implementation, we could also include other proofs, such as solvency (mentioned below), know your customer and other specific facts about the contact.
We chose Bitcoin's blockchain because it's the most proven to be immutable.

I once sent out an automated batch of transactions that included several duplicates transactions.  I personally emailed the holders of the wallets and received almost half of the refunds.

Apparently the FBI has in its possession 173,991 bitcoins.  What do you all think about this petition?

The scroller starts on the average of all markets for the currency selected and the range is based on the spread.  The diff between top/bottom quickly lead to this problem.

Keep an eye on the btc price and do conversions.

With $80M of bitcoins today, and it's potential to appreciate, he may be able to hire a super team of lawyers to defend his case.

ZeroBlock and btcReport are good friends and are looking at ways of working together.

How about working with a website, such as bitcoin-central.net, that supports Yubi keys help?  You have to physically insert the key to login.

That's exactly how we see it at Paytunia.com.  We're working to create a trusted payment network alongside bitcoin.  Visa and Mastercard are essentially doing the same with the dollar.
We believe it helps to scale the bitcoin network by reducing the number of transactions processed through the network.  Instead they are cleared intra-bitcoin-wallet.

Hey guys, I'm the developer of btcReport.  We're shipping a fix for this today.  
For the techies out there, the min/max was based on an avg price for all the exchanges we support.  The spread between the top and bottom markets got too wide too quickly.
All in all, my apologies for the bugs.  We released a massive upgrade to support more exchanges and have yet to perfect it.
Once we're stable with the app+backend, we'll be revisiting alerts for a more improved user experience.
Thanks!
