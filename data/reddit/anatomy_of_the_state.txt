but my purchasing power is up 10x for the year, most people in for a few years took mad profits during the parabolic move and are getting ready to average back in. fomos who thought they could buy a top and would get rich need to learn to buy even when it isnt exciting.

the difference vetween old hands and new hands is pretty obvious in this exchange. 10k is an amazingly high price for btc. 20k was a blow off top and anyone in longer than a year was foolish not to take profit between 15-20k. sorry you bought the top of a bubble, now just dca in for a few more years.

btc cant be generated by a privileged gang like fiat. govt and banks collude to give elites of society the new money before it dilutes in purchasing power. crypto wont change inequality but it will remove monetary policy from control of the war mongers and destroyers, and hopefully empowers builders.

People will spend it on something they value more than the potential gains, causing people to delay fulfilling wants and building capital. We are starting to see a competition between state credit money and blockchain, and greshams law does suggest people will spend their fiat and save crypto. Savvy investors will be able to recapture capital accumulation gains that have been denied by inflationary money by using crypto as a longterm savings account (just need to cash out during the crazy times and make scheduled deposits during the boring times).

once btc establishes its dominance with stable prices the btc:gold ratio will be stabalized and show fiat to be worthless. gold and silver will be a convenient means of payment for those wishing to stay completely offgrid or carry a device, if the grid goes down, or to avoid transaction fees. unfortunately for pm holders the ratios will likely be 1:100 so btc is a better buy. i think fees may always be high for onchain transactions for small purchases, if there are millions of other simultaneous transactions are also occuring, and pm coins may be used as pocket money. both are highly attractive for their inflation protection, and fun to hodl.

so you admit they have a bad reputation? like one for dishonesty? nyt lies us into war, covered up wienstein, hired the guy that covered up jimmy savile, has been shown on undercover video to be run by partisans, and changed the trump wiretapping headline  (just examples off the top of my head).
here a brand new story about russian collusion and BRIBERY, nyt wont touch this one though

Metals will be the pocket change of the future as they have many inverse qualities to crypto and have no transaction fees.

i meant hype not activity. overinvested meaning it is going to hurt if btc goes back to 2k

the dip was yesterday and last week. when you put cash in, make limit orders that spread from a little below current price to 30% reduced. walk away and do it again next month. If you think we are bottoming out at some point cancel some limit orders and do a market order to twist the knife

people can do what they want but I will laugh at all of the socialists fomoing in, getting rekt, and wanting government regulation. crypto will undermine the state so no more welfare, get a job or build capital.

@_date: 2018-04-03 22:08:14
oh youve been telling people about bitcoin for years, when it was actually kind of cheap at $500, or you have been telling people to buy as a hype bubble subsides...?
@_date: 2018-04-14 13:42:15
ahh yes cryprocurrency the passion of fascists. crypto will make the state obsolete and early adopter libertarians are going to get to test even more of their ideas.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:37:49
yeah and all coins come from miners who are capitalistic entrepreneurs selling their good, btc is basically a commodity of digital scarcity. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:13:57

lol in december btc went from 10k to 20k, this is the hangover. if you think the party is just going to start back up you havent watched markets for very long.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:30:20
i was telling people not to buy at over 10k because it was clearly the blow off top time.
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:49:21
This tech and space was built by libertarians, statists should stay the fuck out.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:33:55
true if the people know what they are doing and saving incrementally, going in heavy during a record setting year fuels bubbles and creates volatility that decreases btc use as a currency. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:45:13
but investing isnt nearly as fun as gambling. i especially enjoyed the guys who cashed out their 401ks to buy btc at 12k, they could have at least just bought gbtc instead of paying the tax penalty.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:25:32
i look awesome, bought at 400 sold at 15k. learn to bubble, you buy when it is quiet not shooting up, see you in 2022
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:12:07
Except us neckbeard libertarians built this stuff, got in way early, and sell to losers who dont now how to bubble. enjoy the free market, why would I leave when i make 25x my money every 4 years. Most early bitcoiners were goldbugs, and silver and btc were trading at libertarian festivals for over 5 years. the people actually using crypto are black markets and libertarians.
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:40:37
it's always a good time in bitcoin, when the price is low I am buying and when the market is euphoric I am selling.

curious if there is anyone here who voted for hillary or bernie in 2016? my hypothesis is there are few big govt supporters in crypto and the socialists are going to use the state to try to steal our crypto?
