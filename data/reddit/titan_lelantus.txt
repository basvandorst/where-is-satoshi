2. A Mars currency... really... I think we're about a century at least from seeing any form of outerspace and interplanet bartering.
3. Checking out the Marscoin foundation, and believe me I know this, it looks like one big pump and dump coin...
4. The idea of a foundation.... rofl.
All in all, no, just no.

Anyone reading this thinking this has anything at all to do with Bitcoin's popularity please dont get it twisted. Bitcointalk has had a number of site failures and hacks. User information including passwords have been leaked in the past. Also the site operators have been said to be misappropriating donated funds and making up extortionate fees so they can pocket them. As a long term Bitcoin member I used to keep track of Bitcointalk for all my news in the past, now I find reddit, and various news sites are much better. Bitcointalk won't die but it will certainly shrink its user base because of their alienation and reputation as a breeding ground for shit coins....

@_date: 2014-12-19 21:00:53
It doesnt matter what they need to make once the coins have been mined, the fees are the same. You cant make people send more or less, theyll send what they want to. Hopefully if adoption goes up, each block will have more transactions which means more blocks, but the time we'll see fee's above the current 25 or future 12.5 btc rewards will be a while. 
Using your assumption on what miners need to pay their electricity, this wont make fees in btc more, but this will have an increase on price, therefore a single btc wont cost $315, but much higher

I agree with you in the short to medium term, but one day in say 5-10 years time, while you will still be able to buy bitcoin with fiat and vice versa, I believe itll be its own source of value, equal to fiat in acceptance.

TL;DR, just going on the first two lines, the market is not that saturated. The market is heavily overbought, and as for huge selling pressure.... volume was not that great. We're in a state of limbo right now, but generally we have way too many bagholders who wont sell, as soon as we get the slightest whiff of $500 we're going muhn. The network effect essentually means sooner or later a lot of the 21 million coins will be held in wallets and not traded online. The natural effect of Bitcoin means that over time, like gold, supply is naturally removed from the market. (unlike gold, proof of existence on the ledger means fake reserves cant be used to manipulate the market... see gata.org)

Sure in a perfect world that would be there, but ultimatley the way of the market would ensure someone would pretty much undercut.... and it would be the big miners. Thats why we wouldnt see a dramatic increase in fee price as someone will always do it cheaper than others. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:17:06
What youll effectively get is the current situation. Those who paid off their hardware a long time ago will just charge fee's that are electricity cost plus a bit. The big hardware manufacturers are able to produce cheaper hardware too, so theyll pay it off sooner, and then charge a cheaper fee to ensure they get the blocks jammed with transactions

Go to the development topics on bitcointalk... but yes its a mess. At the moment bitcoin can handle 7 tx a second which is a lot. But itll only take a small fix to double up the block size so dont worry its not a huge concern. Im pretty much betting that the devs are working on a new update anyway. If the problem was really hard to fix then worry but so far things you raised are not huge big deals.

No stupid to just let people who commit victimless crimes off with a not guilty. I understand what you guys are after but this is not the way to do it... Perhaps educating jurors to the gain loss ratio in a case... but not automatically saying 'Not Guilty'. Example, you are saying DPR committed a victimless crime, when in fact he pushed for members of his staff to get killed, and also allowing a platform where gang run cartels could sell their merchandise. Even if they are not directly selling them, the drugs, such as cocaine, lsd etc are produced in mass scales by these gangs who abuse their own lands. Im not anti drug, anything but, I like some just like others, but I dont believe in one second that guys like DPR should get away with what he did. For me he crossed the line in trying to get people killed.... if he didnt go doing this I may have seen some admiration in what he did by decentralising the drug marketplace. I believe that these marketplaces may be destroying regional gangs, but not the originating cartels etc.

regarding your first point, at least you are removing outside influence from hackers by holding your seed. Think of it like putting something in a safe. Its safe until someone breaks into the safe which is a rarety. Regarding fire etc, you can make 2 or 3 copies and store them in different locations to be safe. Also make sure you have password encrypted on your trezor, itll be super safe. 
Secondly regarding your usb, the usb didnt get hacked, im assuming your computer had malware which is the reason you lost coins. The usb is safe, but when you transfered onto there you must have had a copy on the computer. Malware is the biggest oversight regarding wallet storage, you need to check very meticulously.
Disclaimer... I own a trezor and can say its super safe and easy to use. Only bummer is theres no litecoin support yet. But otherwise its one of the safest methods of storage. Even if theres malware on the host pc unless the trezor signs the transaction off you wont lose coins.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Marshals Service announced on Tuesday that three bidders won last week's third auction of bitcoins seized from Ross Ulbricht, convicted of operating black-market website Silk Road.
Marshals Service spokeswoman Lynzey Donahue said in an email that the winning bidders won quantities totalling 27,000, 20,000, and 3,000 bitcoins, adding the transfer of the virtual currencies have been completed. There were a total 50,000 bitcoins auctioned off.
She did not give the identities of the winners.
