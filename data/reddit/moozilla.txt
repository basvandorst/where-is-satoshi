I've made several BTC by writing open source articles for the Devcoin wiki, and coding open source software. (Actually, several million DVC, which I then converted to BTC.)

Try [their official support thread on Bitcointalk]( I had a similar issue with them, luckily was only $50, but it ended up taking them 8 days for me to receive my purchase. Unfortunately, it seems like a common issue lately, that thread has had 200 pages of posts in the last week alone! (Also it's kind of ridiculous that they don't respond to support tickets filed on their site or by email, and make you find some forum thread.)

It was 2.89 when I was considering getting in yesterday. Decided to wait for the dividends to pay out. It was 2.86 when I woke up this morning...

There is still money to be made on alt chains.

Buy shares of a stock or bond on BTCT, eg. you could buy 4-5 shares of [this](

I highly suggest talking to this guy OP. I had a problem with my bitinstant order and USRAY on Bitcointalk (who apparently is the same guy as this) resolved it.
I had to wait 8 days, but they did eventually complete my order!

You're much better off buying DMS.MINING than BASIC-MINING. The price/Mhash of DMS.MINING is better than any other mining stock or bond out there that is currently paying out dividends, and if you look at the history of dividends it is MUCH better.
Now is actually a really good time to buy DMS.SELLING, since we're due for a 0.008BTC dividend _per share_ (that's like 25% of what you invest) on the 12th. Just make sure that you sell your shares after the dividend and buy MINING again before the prices correct back. (Although, I admit this is a bit of a risk, so if you want a safer investment, now is a great time to get in on DMS.MINING since the price is low from everyone selling their shares to by SELLING. MINING shares are currently 0.016950 - I expect that to correct back up to 0.018-0.019 in the next few days.)
That all said, the numbers I have ran show DMS.MINING (and other mining bonds I've ran as well) to be a much better investment than ASICMINER, when you consider the daily dividends and compound interest, even with the difficulty skyrocketing. Unless you think ASICMINER could get over 10btc a share in the next few months, but I seriously doubt that.
