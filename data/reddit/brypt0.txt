Firstly, what's 11000 to 19000000 percent wise? On top of that, have you heard of a pension? SS? Dividends? The sheer fact that its a negligable percent of his portfolio does infact invalidate the premise that it is a bad investment. Secondly, bitcoin is not just some highly volatile investment. If we were talking about a random penny stock or shitcoin you would be right. Are you just holding for quick gains or do you actually understand it enough to see the big picture?

A lot of negative comments. So old people should stay away from learning about new technology because we don't know how much longer they'll live? I've been trying to convince my 42 year old mom of why bitcoin is amazing--showing her log charts, explaining the capped supply and halving, comparing the marketcap to gold, etc--and I don't think I've convinced her yet. Honestly, good job.

the red prediction line on that chart's sayin we wont get another bull run till like 21-22, if it actually takes a year after block halving for the price to start going up that would really catch a lot of people off guard lol

Thanks for replying,
I am talking about solo mining I guess I should've clarified. You wont make any money from fees even if you don't mine the block? For some reason I thought every miner at least made some money from fees.
Like, I thought different miners filled the block with transactions and consequently earned the fees from those transactions, but whoever actually mined the block got the reward.
Could you explain how it actually works?
@_date: 2019-03-28 18:26:17
So you could potentially be mining solo and never make a dime? Lol, thought they at least got some fees

When I had stuck transactions several months ago it took like 2 weeks and the transaction got cancelled and the bitcoin returned. Not sure how the congestions doing rn, check

Thanks! It is a very short amount of time, so I was going to talk about shitty international banking, who satoshi is (one of the best stories imo), why the network is secure (where I would briefly touch on mining + hash power) and how the price moves (hype cycles and where the block reward halving usually falls within the cycles using some visual graphs, so I could maybe convince some to dip their toes cause of the halving coming up).
I'm probably not going in depth on how mining itself works, I just realized I kind of don't understand who gets the fees. I get the 10 minute block reward, I was just under the impression that blocks got filled by various miners who then earned those fees, but the reward itself was for whoever actually mined the block. But apparently I'm wrong and you could be hypothetically mining forever and not make a dime? I \*really\* understand the pool appeal now but damn lol

sure, tone vays
why do all your posts make you sound like a bitfinex'ed sockpuppet lol
any way have fun getting an aneurysm when the inevitable bull run happens :)

yeah, I was watching the price like a hawk at the time, here's my tweet:

they should investigate the sec

565 days until the next reward halving!

holy shit i was looking at different format &amp; thought the '17 was the day my bad
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:48:42
hang in there m8! think of the block reward halvening!
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:11:50
Ok good idea, I'm just confused by the page. There's 3 sections: mnemonic, derivation path, and derived addresses.
For the mnemonic, I've changed it to 12 words, entered my mnemonic, and entered my pass phrase. 
For the derivation path, I've changed it to BIP49 (because when I was talking to support, they said I could verify if I restored the correct wallet by checking the address calculator to see if the wallet had the same receive address as my transaction. The type of address is BIP49 segwit) 
And if all the above is correct, then the derived addresses should have the same receive address as my transaction? Or what am I looking for in this case? I'm just not very technically savvy with all this, sorry.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:22:14
yeah, and I figured out you have to check both "BIP39" and "extent this seed with custom words" when restoring your seed. 
I've also tried with all three of options for restoring that follow this part.
legacy (p2pkh)
p2sh-segwit (p2wpkh-p2sh)
native segwit (p2wpkh)
None have worked.
This is crazy cause I know for sure that I wrote down the correct mnemonic and pass phrase

I'm not sure if there are bitcoin atms in Canada but I would be surprised if there were't. That's how I bought my btc considering I don't use banks
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:55:46
I solved it! I edited the original post to describe what I had to do.
Thank you for caring, I am extremely grateful!
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:13:48
Thanks. Nothing has worked thus far :(
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:07:05
Now I'm just having trouble trying to restore a 12 word seed in ellectrum. Apparently they changed to 13, trying to research what I can do now.
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:05:16
i could never articulate why it sounds wrong but this is it
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:36:27
No, but thanks for following up. 
I came across this post where they had a similar issue to mine:
and this post where they're saying that they couldn't export their samourai wallet into electrum:  
The person with the similar issue to mine got their coins back after a long time of trying, by installing an older version of samourai and restoring it there. I've had no luck with that so far, so I messaged them maybe to get some advice or the exact version they were successful using.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:25:36
No that's not it. I tried switching tor on and off, also data connection. None worked. Support is saying that the wallet I'm restoring doesn't have the same receive address as the wallet with the btc in it, because I'm not using the same mnemonic or possibly passphrase. I know I am though, and others have also had this 0 btc balance issue in the past.
I'm going to try using electrum, I haven't yet because I've never used that wallet before and also other have said this did not work for them, I'm afraid I wont know what to do if I try and it doesn't work.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:43:40
I figured out how it's supposed to be done in electrum (file &gt; new/restore &gt; standard wallet &gt; i already have a seed &gt; enter the seed and click options, check extend this seed with custom words and BIP39 seed, hit next then enter passphrase)
but it hasn't worked. So I found this other post where others were having the same problem, they were entering everything correctly but it wouldn't restore:
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:35:05
Once. I made the wallet and sent my btc to it in jan, that's the 1 transaction shown for the address in the block explorer:

@_date: 2019-05-16 20:15:05
I tried breadwallet but I can't find the option to add the bip39 password along with the seed, and just the seed has not worked :(
