Right, I don't disagree. But your entire comment is a critique of the system, it doesn't change the facts. And the facts are that these laws and regulations are in place, and whether or not big banks break them at their own discretion, doesn't mean that they can't and shouldn't enforce them in other scenarios.
Whether you agree or not, cryptocurrency had been used and will continue to be used in MANY illicit endeavors. The financial institutions are going to try and mitigate risks of getting hell thrown at them by the SEC, until they can figure out what do to. Chances are they just introduce their own block-chain backed system, I know BBVA, UBS, and Chase are already working on these things.

Oh... Right... That's called covering their asses.
If it turns out you are some sort of drug kingpin, at least they can show a log with notes or even recording of you saying you're not. They don't have a magic 8ball but they do need to do some sort of due diligence.
And I agree that it's congressional nonsense. I think we have too many regulations, especially when they're not even being uses effectively or effeciently.

Email can do what posted correspondences did, but faster and better.
Bitcoin cannot be used to make electronics, medical devices, dental structures, jewelry, or for various other things like space tech. 
Bitcoin is great, I have some, but comparing it to gold is comparing apple to oranges. A proper comparison is to compare block-chain technology for money transfer to bank wires and ACHs. 
Bitcoin was intended to be used as a currency, and thus a means of transferring funds, NOT as an investment vehicle you just let sit in a vault. An investment that is neither tangible nor has utility it's faith-based value is not a sustainable or stable one. 
This whole bitcoin futures trading and funds nonsense are only going to hurt bitcoin. Everyone trying to invest in it right now has no idea how the technology works, nor what it really is, which means it can turn into a volatile, emotion-based, penny stock style trading environment.

To be fair, I do a lot of business in East Africa and there are very strict AML/CTF protocols in place.
And I said it happens with new accounts. If it's a source I deal with regularly they don't care. If I'm suddenly trying to wire $1M to a new account in Rwanda they're going to want to have "Know Your Client" info and so on.

First of all, the IRS does keep track of investments such mutual funds. Secondly, as with other investments, you only get taxed when you realize the profit, hence being called a "capital GAINS tax". 
It seems you are just complaining about not wanting to pay taxes, and ironically you are probably one of the people that complain about rich people or corporation evading taxes when you're basically trying to use BTC to do the same. 
Edit. 
Just read your "EDIT 2". Gotcha

That's not how it works.... If I wire $10k from my Chase account to someone else's BoA account, they don't just say "welp it's going to BoA, so it's all good". They want to know who is on the receiving end of the account.
Whether or not you think it's bull shit doesn't change that the regulations are in place.
I own a company that does international business, and I have to deal with the headache of this stuff all the time. New account I'm sending money to? They want copies of the passports of the account holders and all sorts of documentation that's proving I'm not breaking the patriot act and what not.
Regulations are a pain in the ass to growth and that's why a lot of GOP people hate it, but it's a double edged issue. What keeps bad people from doing bad shit also keeps good people from doing good shit via the same channels.

I own a company that mines and exports precious metals, including gold.
Gold is used in electronics, medical devices, dentistry, space technology, and of course jewelry. 
It also has thousand upon thousands of years of historical demand behind it which gives investors price confidence.

I mean... it's not a wrong criticism if the person is holding any substantial amount of money. It's like storing the ket to your home under the doormat outside. 
Also, this was most likely an inside job by the company itself.

He never specifically says what it's for. My point was that it is intrinsically perfect for illicit activities, and that environment is exactly where it started and flourished. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:27:45
The only reason they care is because they are being held under SEC regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, which puts them in a place of responsibility to know where their account holders are getting money from. It's typically going to be for amounts larger than $10,000 in an effort to crack down on money laundering and illicit business.
 No matter how much you love crypto currency, it's naive and ignorant to ignore the fact that at the end of the day, they were very much made as vehicle to move money for illicit activities (it was pretty much born for Silk Road).
If I owned a small bank and I see someone is moving 10s of thousands of dollars back and forth to and from anonymous sources, I'd definitely be putting my guard up. One account holder being linked to some sort of illegal activity and the SEC is going to rain hell fire on the bank. I may be wrong, but chances are OP wasn't just trading a couple hundred bucks here and there.

Eh, I think sometimes if the situation is dire and it's the only option, and you're asking for a reasonable amount, it's fine. Assuming you're the type of person that pays back and don't leave your friend having to be the guy that has to remind you to pay them back.

Someone disappearing over owing you money isn't "a friend", at least not a good one.

I'm not saying it would be fair, in fact I don't think it's at all reasonable to expect someone to pay you back an unrealized ROI. My point was that he said his friend was bad with money and would leave if it were a big number.

This is pretty misleading. 1% of the world owns 90% of the wealth, and it's because of basic economics. 
These relativistic stats are poor indicators in general. The average American is in the top 1% of the world, and minimum wage puts them at the top 2%. People keep using percentages to make it look like it's an "us vs them". 
Furthermore, 50% of that bottom 90% has net 0 assets or is negative by having more debt, which also skews statistics. Also, it's the top 0.1% of that top 1% that own like 90% of the wealth.

That's not how it works. It's based on intrinsic value vs market value (economicly, not from a ethics value theory perspective). You can't just look at the supply without taking demand into account. Aside from a complete disregard for how complex the actual underlying of "value" is (such as the micro and macro economics, markets, social atmosphere and outlook in regards to the specific commodity or currency, etc...). In a system where the demand for bitcoin is that high there would most likely be pressures towards making gold also skyrocket in demand and thus value. Not saying bitcoin (or any future digital currency) won't ever reach that price, but using basic math, very broad assumptions, and correlative facts isn't how it works.

Many people are trying to help establish a btc system in places like Africa.  It can really help those types of areas.

But the use of it as an actual daily value for currency and purchase of goods/services is very important. If people are only transferring it and saving it as an investment vehicle, then  it loses its value as a currency model. 
It would also decrease the odds of mass adoption since most people don't really deal with investments, but everyone deals with buying things. That can cause bitcoin (or any digital coin) to go into a negative spiral.
Simply put, if these coins are not mass adopted as a use of "money" for daily life as opposed to hoarding it for a "maybe I'll get rich in the future), then it's not going to do well.

It's not a question about how high it goes, it's a question about whether that price is sustainable and if it will crash. It can hit $10M and crash, or it can reach $10k and be stable for the next 30 years. The latter is more important.

There's a difference between money and currency, in this case, fiat. 
Someone can also estimate the fiat worth of something. If I say "it's estimated that $100M worth of diamonds are laundered" it could mean that people simply just handed diamond to one another as a store of value in exchange for whatever else they wanted. The $100M value is just to give everyone a mental comparison of how valuable the transactions were.

You should really have an internal investigation. See if employees suddenly have new found money, or their family or close friends. But realistically whoever did it is probably smart enough to hold on to them for several years, maybe even leave the company. Good luck.

This is idiotic. Just because someone can have something stolen from them doesn't make it not theirs. So if you ever park your car outside of your garage it's not your car? If at any time your phone isn't in your pocket it's not yours?
Yea sure, your habits can increase the odds of you being robbed, but to say he didn't own/deserve the coins is nonsense. 
Bitcoin is also not supposed to be some secret hard to use form of money reserved for the technologically savvy. If it's to be adopted by the masses and gain real spend value then it needs to be something the average person can work with and feel safe. Their money should feel just as safe with Clinbase as it with a Bank or institution like Fidelity, or what's the point?

There may be a statute of limitations affecting you at this point. When someone steals something from you, you can't really wait several years and the value happens to go up and you decide to now file a lawsuit. I have no idea what the laws in Australia are, but you should go into it.

You can always Google it yourself.
But,I agree, if the OP's intention is to get donations sent, s/he should take the initiative to provide info.
Peterson is basically a big soci-political figure in Canada and the USA. He's a clinical psychologist at U of Toronto. He goes as classic leberalism, but he's fairly conservative (due to his fairly strict religious creed). He's gotten a but big due to his outspoken condemnation of people that are toooo liberal. For example, he doesn't believe in laws to protect a trans person from being called by pronoun they identify as since it would go against freedom of speech.
I agree with a good deal of what he says, he's very pragmatic and realistic, however some of his viewpoints I'm very much against, and they happen to be the ones that involve him pushing his religious ideals. 
Over all, he has a very large platform and him getting only $1,000 in donations in a week is actually incredibly sad. I would have thought he would have resided 10-100 times that, especially since the first week or two is when there is the biggest fire under donation requests.
