Hahaha I thought it meant the value of Bitcoin at first.  Very confused/excited.

Haha!  That worked!  I downloaded a fresh file from my email and it worked, while the ones I had on my desktop wouldn't ever accept my password or wanted a second one.  Weird.  Thanks!
Edit: wait, nevermind.  It's saying that one is empty :/  Now I'm more confused.  Cause I have the address stored as a Watch Only elsewhere and it shows funds.
Edit 2: Looks like the file in my email and the files on the computer are different backups.  None seem to have the same passwords.  The one that appears to have the actual funds on it, no password works for.  I don't know how to get to it.
Edit 3: Ok so the different backups had different passwords for whatever reasons, and importing created a new address which confused me.  But importing the old backup that my password worked on actually let me use a private key recovery tool, and I'm all good now.  Not sure why it let me import onto blockchain with the same file and didn't bring the funds/wallet over with it.

So basically you got $35k at today's rate instead of Friday's rate?  They ate $13k for their screw up and saved you from the loss you could have incurred?
Pretty awesome customer service resolution there, and great for you if it goes up from today's price!

Then how much were people able to invest back then, or was it mostly mining at that point?
I have to think there are literally new millionaires on this sub now.

Word of advice I received when I was younger.  If you truly want into something, nothing is really stopping you, only excuses.
If you had a guarantee that $100 today would give you $10,000 in two years, you would find a way to get that money.

Really?  I heard they've been able to recover from drives in fires, water damaged and rusted, and even shot.

Have you tried higher level professional recovery?  
They can do forensic level recovery.  May cost a few thousand if they recover it, but with the amount you have, it's worth it.
