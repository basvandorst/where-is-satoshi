If this was a title from 18 months ago....the whole crypto market would pump at least 10%

Our personal wealth, mine, yours the regular people who don't own banks or institutions...at least I don't :)

Totally agree with you, and on top of that when the normies start to see some positive news on main stream media and start to feel a bit more confident about buying bitcoin, Red lines ruin it.
If you open YouTube there are so many crypto related channels and 99% of them are full of sh\*t
There are two channels I follow producing great content:
"Data Dash" and "Coin Mastery"
However, people outside of the crypto scene will hardly discover these guys.

It's just another "smart" way to pump the price, dump their bags and now start accumulating again before the market won't be as easy to control/manipulate.
I just hate how people with such great influence are only using it to get their already super rich asses even richer, rather than try to have at least a little positive impact on our spoiled society.

What a stupid way to show off, perhaps he/she has a Bitfinex affiliate link somewhere on the car as well :)))

I don't think anybody knows on 100% what was the exact reason for this or any other dump, but here is what I think is the solution:
We should all stop thinking short terms, focus on the macro and whenever someone ask you about bitcoin you teach them the same, because what main stream media and shithead Youtubbers are "preaching" doesn't help the average Joe to understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin.
If you're looking for a YouTube channel that analyzes the market as a whole and focuses on the macro things I recommend you check "Data Dash" and "Coin Mastery"
I'm not not associated with this guys, just recommend them as they provide tons of free value rather than analyzing the charts and tell you which dip to buy.
@_date: 2018-09-08 18:31:19
You're missing the point....as yoi can see from the way people react to your spammy posts and comments, not everyone has the same mindset like you do, in fact most people here don't.
And that's not because they're stupid, it's because they understand the fundamentals and the fact that people like you are screwing up the whole idea of Bitcoin for short term benefits rather then let the market mature and allow everyone involved at this point to get substantial wealth.
That's the biggest problem of society today: Everyone wants fast results, no patience, no long term thinking....

Great piece of news, but to be honest I don't think "good news" work as they used to in terms of price movement...neither than charts are showing which direction the price will go as accurate as in other markets...we are still in a stage where only the Whales have a significant impact. 
Would love to hear more opinions as I'm not an expert
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:26:09
And with those great news the Bitcoin went 5%+ down....Seems like crypto good news doesn't work like they used to
@_date: 2018-09-08 08:06:05
I hear you, very few people have the balls to buy something even at $100 per piece and not sell it at $500 or $1000.
A friend of mine was telling me back in 2008 to buy computers and start generating this digital coin that suppose to increase its value in time.
Of course I said this was another internet scam and missed that opp, but let's say we did start to mine Bitcoin when it was about $10 per coin I don't think I would hold it until now.
I know someone mining ETH Classic and he has shitloads....what he did is put them in a wallet and locked it with some software for 2 years.
I guess nowadays it's easier to think long term when you know what happened the last 10 years.
@_date: 2018-09-13 10:23:11
Yup, fun coupons sounds about right :) 
@_date: 2018-09-08 13:34:14
Hahahah, must've been right? Don't really remember what year it was, just that it was worth about $10.
Never took advantage of that opportunity anyway, so it doesn't matter. 
Thanks for your input
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:53:30
I totally agree they have to and will embrace it as they don't really have another option and yes you're right.
Wall Street sharks want to put their hands on as much bitcoin as they can at this price levels so they can made more money.
Governments on the other hand are scared that if they can't control the crypto they'll lose control over the population.
My point is that all this volatility caused mainly by the wall street guys have a very negative impact to the average Joe, who would've started to buy a little every once in a while even if using it as a store of value rather than currency
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:22:07
I don't think good news have the impact on the market they used to. But always being optimistic about Bitcoin, it's only a matter of time to see new ATH
@_date: 2018-09-07 08:37:27
Absolutely, unfortunately most people who are preaching about bitcoin are trying to educate the average Joe how to get to the moon using the elevator.
I'm planing to do a educational video series about Bitcoin and spread it across social media just as an experiment to see how people will consume this kind of content.
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:10:35
We can surely make some money riding their waves, but shouldn't we focus on the Macro and think about what will happen to Bitcoin in 5 years if these fuckerz keep buying tons of it?
Aren't we going to miss this chance to not allow anybody control our wealth?
@_date: 2018-09-09 07:05:34
I don't think we should feel sorry about it, there are many other "great" opportunities I've come across during the last 15 years and none of them is here.
I think we're still in the game at the right time and if we focus on the long term we'll do great.
@_date: 2018-09-30 18:12:10
This baby rallies happened so many times in the past 6 months that I'm not sure if someone is actually getting excited by such headlines
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:15:04
Those big red lines every time the price goes a little over 7K are getting most people who are involved in the market for more than 12 months  very frustrated, but that's not the big problem as most of us will keep our minds straight and Hodl.
The bigger problem this blood sucking whales are creating is that although everyone who has internet is aware of Bitcoin already this volatility scares the sh*t out of them, therefore there is no fresh retail investors money coming in and slowly but surely Bitcoin becomes the digital gold for the big boys.
I encourage everyone who has even a little influence on social media or anywhere else to educate people about Bitcoin and current market situation, if we just sit and wait for another bull run, the Sharks will buy enough Bitcoin to manipulate the market even more in future.
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:34:04
I really don't get the point of such predictions....I mean 2030, that's 12 years from now...we should be more focused on helping newbies understand crypto rather than engaging with such posts.
No hard feelings, just my opinion
@_date: 2018-09-17 09:18:46
Considering Bitcoin was pronounced "Dead" on media quite a few times during the years I think we should definitely celebrate this anniversary...but more importantly we should share this with family and friends non-believers and get them into the crypto space, before it's too late.
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:24:06
I'm sure you're killing it and making shitloads of money....and you're on Reddit looking for some affiliate commissions just because you want to help people get wealthy right?
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:53:49
Not sure whether the moon journey is still on, but we can certainly retire way earlier if we start doing the DCA now and not be afraid from the bears :)

Nice work...let's hope Bitcoin won't end up like Sir Gregos....Just Kidding, there is no way
