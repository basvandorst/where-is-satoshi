This will be huge for ICON (ICX) which starts trading in a couple weeks.  It’s the only South Korean ICO that got in before the ban on new ICOs and they’re heavily connected to the tech and finance industry all over that country.

I highly recommend you hold it. Don’t fall for the narrative here from a bunch of people who emotionally dumped theirs months ago, and now are full of rage at BCH. 
Hedge yourself on this debate because none of us knows how it will play out. And don’t fall for the narrative that BCH is just run by one individual. It should be painfully obvious at this point that it’s a massive movement trying to solve a huge problem in bitcoin. 
Be wise. Not emotional. And make sure you read all the information sources available on bitcoin. Not just this sub, where the information is often carefully curated.

LN was promised for availability Summer 2016.  At that point Bitcoin was already becoming clogged and fees were already well above where they were supposed to be.  
This created concern and anger among the industry.  People waited, and waited, and waited.  They saw no forward progress on LN - still - for another year.  People rightfully decided BTC would never have a scaling solution. 
This is what spawned alternate implementations of Bitcoin and the idea to fork.  Bitcoin Cash is not a “fear move” because of impending LN.  It was move made because of ***no*** impending LN.  It was a salvage move to save Bitcoin from impending irrelevancy and un-usability because nothing was being done. 
Both LN and BCH seek to fix a problem that has been virtually ignored since 2012 when scaling was already being called a serious concern.  It’s now 2018. This issue got old years ago and has now grown Moss all over it.  We need action.  I hope that LN is not still 18 months away like I saw announced recently.

They were working on it 2.5 years ago.  At some point they can be forced to hurry up.   This nonsense that scope creep can continue forever, and ever, and ever, and ever in the name of "QA" is silly.  At some point a dev team is either moving too slow, or not at all.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:23:24


No.  1 year is an eternity in Crypto.  It has been this way long before any hype bubble existed.  This relates to how quickly the ecosystem changes.  Not hype.  Let’s know our crypto history.  Maybe you weren’t here in 2012...
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:48:59
So continue to support the one that takes 10x longer instead?  Outstanding logic.  Speed will come with time.  It’s still growing forward, unlike the one you prefer.

He got it from endless posts here saying that it shouldn't be used as a currency for small transactions, and that it is a store of value now.  Not sure why you've missed that literal avalanche of sentiment around here...
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:38:59
When you actually look at the technology issues at stake here, there’s one obvious winner. And it isn’t the one everyone here wants it to be. So they have to focus on character assassinations of random people that represent that technology.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:00:12
Bitcoin was not created so that we could refuse to scale it, and “just use Litecoin“. Such responses should be considered an attack on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:12:14


Bingo.  Minus the childish “getting back at Core” part.  He wants to restore Bitcoins function as peer to peer cash. 
And I will also post this to prove you are correct. At least the first part of what you said. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:34:25
And to clarify - anti BTC in this context only means unhappy with the choices being made by the development team in charge of one implementation of BTC (core). It does not mean against bitcoin. I know you said that but just clarifying.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:35:24


Classy.  That’s right.  Demonize and ostracize yet another major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem because they promote a coin you don’t like for emotional reasons.  Is there even 1 company left out there that you guys haven’t boycotted?  
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:33:22


LOL ... unbelievable.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:09:11


We should be focused on the real concern: that their message is accurate.  Bitcoin isn’t usable anymore. That’s not up for debate. It’s not an opinion.  It’s a fact. 
The entire purpose of this technology was to be an electronic payment system that transfers value cheaper and faster than banks. It no longer does that.  
In fact it’s not even feasible to use at all now. And the industry is leaving in droves. Even if the developers are sitting there acting like everything’s okay. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:41:34
If the technology was actually being discussed on its merits, with a fair and balanced representation of both sides, some harsh realizations would hit folks.  
To avoid that, the focus is pushed away from the technological crisis and focused instead on individuals. It’s been this way for a long time. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:31:59


Just because a solution exists doesn't mean it is a rational one that will ever be used.  This is why developers should work closely with product people who interface with end users.  So that what's created will actually be feasible, and implemented.  Unfortunately, these devs have repeatedly said they have little interest in hearing from those players in the ecosystem.  So this is what happens.  Nobody uses what they make.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:14:28
By the way, I appreciate your thoughtful response, minus the Snark and underhanded insults. 
All your post tells me is that this situation is a lot more complicated than many think. But the problem remains. Other teams working on other coins, are able to move forward and work together. 
The question is not whether you’ve provided solutions. The question is why this particular team and industry are failures at forward progress. In other words, the real problem is that the problem is a lot more general. More global.
Of course you will point the finger at them. And they will point the finger at you. But at the end of the day, the two of you together have resulted in failure. This is why I don’t have a problem with alternate implementations and forks popping up. Alternate teams. 
I have strong opinions on why this actually has failed, and they are because I watched the Dev team laugh, mock, and ignore input from the industry. Very condescendingly, similar to how you speak to me here. It’s that same attitude. That same lack of people skills. That same arrogance that I saw day after day.  I saw it firsthand. You can tell me I’m delusional all you like. I watched it play out. 
There has to be compromise. The trade-offs you call deal killers, may not actually be deal killers. And vice versa. At the end of the day it’s an awareness that there will be trade-offs, and that some sacrifices will have to be made for the greater good. 
This I believe is where the failure has occurred. You guys have decided what the greater good is, and you’re making decisions that developers have no right making, because they don’t have first-hand experience out in the industry, or with end-users. 
I know you guys ridicule that line of thinking, but you are incorrect. ***In the real world, development teams consist of more than just developers. And decisions are never made by developers. Developers consult on technical limitations, security risks etc. The decision for the greater good, is made by somebody who has a global understanding of all players in the ecosystem.***
There is a way to move forward on this, but when somebody’s got a stranglehold on the code, and won’t compromise or work together, or even sacrifice some things so that the technology doesn’t end up a complete embarrassing joke like it currently is… The result is failure.

Litecoin has been irrelevant for 8 years and will continue to be.  There are 1,400 other coins out there which do more than LTC.  And it doesn’t have Bitcoins network effect to set it apart from them.

No one got into this to have no currency either.  And that is exactly what Bitcoin has become.  Not a currency anymore.  :(
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:26:25


For Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts this isn’t just about “returns”.  It’s about making sure Bitcoin remains fast and cheap to transact with. (It’s entire reason for being invented in the first place.)
This is an identity war right now. And one side seems to think useless digital gold nuggets that have no utility are just fine. The other side disagrees. 
BitPay - the largest crypto merchant processor in the crypto world just announced Bitcoin Cash support for this very reason.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:09:41
Compelling argument.  You've convinced me (of nothing).  
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:41:11


No.  API support was discovered five days ago and was announced on the other Bitcoin sub. It’s been discussed there for almost a week already.
But the 1 solitary post here about it got downvoted to zero so nobody saw it, because of the bias against BCH here.  Now you see what not having access to all the information can do.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:53:08
You are viewing this as “well we wrote a ton of code“. 
What has been done has is not being adopted by the industry. And that’s because the industry reached out but devs werent interested in their input on how this should work, look, act, etc. 
What problems it should solve. And how it should solve them.
Busywork that doesn’t result in a solution that is desirable and used by the industry, is wasted time. Even if the code is amazing, and even if the solution makes sense to you.
This is why the prevailing mentality that only “engineers”have anything relevant to say about this problem, is very shortsighted. 
When developers operate in a vacuum and reject all input from other players in the ecosystem, they develop things that don’t get used. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:01:42
This is why they aren’t supporting it:

Since you are a fan of utility over useless speculation, I assume you are a fan of BCH? In a weird twisted sense, you match the worldview of those who are trying to make bitcoin peer to peer cash again.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:10:06


They are. BitPay is Bitcoins biggest merchant processor and is now developing for BCH due to the BTC fee / delay problems.  
Coinbase, Bitstamp, countless exchanges and literally every Bitcoin ATM company in the world have already begun / finished modifying their code to add BCH support for the same reasons.  
Steam was the biggest merchant accepting BTC for payments and just dropped BTC support a couple weeks ago. 
There are over 7 dev teams working on alternate implementation solutions to problems that are being ignored in BTC.  
Living in a bubble of denial with a hyper-focus on Roger Ver isn’t going to change the actual problem facing Bitcoin right now.  


This has nothing to do with Roger.  It’s about a technological innovation that was poised to change the world by being faster and cheaper than banks.  
This is about that innovation now being slower and more expensive than banks and a dev team that seems to not give a rats ass about that for some strange reason.  This is about BTC losing literally all of its utility. 
I couldn’t care less if Satan himself was the one fixing it.  And Roger is hardly Satan. He may be socially awkward and say stupid things sometime s, but he cares about Bitcoins purpose.  
And he’s hardly alone.  Even Vitalik Buterin (creator of Ethereum) and Coinbase CEO are BCH proponents now because it solves the problem that needs to be fixed.  It needed to be fixed four years ago.

LN doesn't just arrive.  LN needs to be coopted.  Doesn't it?  Channels.  Hubs.   Processing systems.  Software.  Hardware?   Honest question.   
Bitcoin just works.   That's all it has to do.  
Is just .... work.  
Its a finished product on-chain.   
Anytime you create something that requires adoption and customization and participation on top of the original product, you're going to have a miserable time with adoption.
See SegWit for example.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:38:53


Oh, so because he wrote it five months ago, it’s no longer valid? 
Or you are just anti-BCH because you sold all of it (or never had any) and now only hold BTC.  So you’re worried its value will drop. Let’s call this what it really is, shall we?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:00:31
If there is any dump at all, it will rebound higher than before, afterwards.  Nearly a million BCH has been dumped by companies all through November and it still came out the other end higher than $2,000. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:33:57
There is absolutely no correlation between how much code you wrote (which isn’t being used), and the price of bitcoin currently. Nor is it indicative that BTC is doing well as a technology. There is no correlation.
None.  Zero.  
BTC price is rising due to speculative hope of future price increases. 
Nothing more. 
BTC isn’t even (rationally) usable for anything right now due to fees and wait times. It is far more logical to simply use a bank or PayPal. Or western union.
In its current state, BTC has no innovation, and nothing new to offer the world. I can hide money under my mattress if I am only looking for a useless store of value. 
Please do not attribute price gains to any success technologically.  We need to fix this problem. Not live in denial. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:03:51
Because it was a technology that was decided by developers, to the protest of the entire industry, but they had no interest in what the industry had to say. 
There were [numerous meetings with them to discuss better options]( but they couldn’t be bothered. 
So now they’ve created something that nobody wants to use. Which is exactly what happens when you let developers run the show. They think they’re smarter than everyone else, and that “non-technical people“ are idiots, so they create something nobody wants to use. 
We warned everyone of this for years. And now here we are. And all of you are scratching your heads. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:09:54


The entire reason we are in this position right now is because this particular team “tests” things for years.  The scope creep is insane.  And things get so far behind schedule that the product itself suffers.  At what point do you trade the slow speed of testing for a more efficient, competent team?  
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:04:54


No. We’ve been saying this for five years. Nothing has progressed. I know a lot of you are new here, but most of us aren’t. There’s a reason these alternate implementations have popped up. Because everybody got tired of waiting. An insane amount a reasonable time was given, and what was done was insufficient, and not what the industry asked for. So let’s stop saying “it’ll get better“. We are way past that point.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:47:23
Gemini will add Bitcoin Cash support before it adds a coin with no relevance to Crypto like Litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:54:56


Bitcoin cash exists because the Core dev team refused to scale bitcoin, which is why it’s now currently costing over $20 and taking days to send one transaction. Back in 2012, before it was derailed, it cost less than a penny, and took 10 minutes. 
This is why bitcoin forked to BCH and now bitcoin cash exists. No matter what anyone here tells you, this is the truth. Some of them dumped theirs in August, so now they are anti-BCH. Others simply have decided that it’s OK that bitcoin is no longer a currency. 
Those who promote BCH feel that it should be a fast, cheap currency, and want to restore that function. This is the honest, truthful difference. The other response you got, is not.
My recommendation is that you hold both BTC and BCH, because there is no way to know how this will play out.
