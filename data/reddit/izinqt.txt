Yes but that is the market made up by thousands of people not two individuals making a deal that is also contradicting the market.

Have you actually used PayPal? hahha
@_date: 2015-06-16 09:43:53
What are these colored coins that everyone seems to talk about??
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:27:28
Exactly my point
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:29:12
Interesting concept but there must be some other part of this? There is obviously a trust issue here right? Cause the satoshi isn't actually valued at X amount but valued for it's market price. So both parties would have to agree about this special value and never change their minds about it? How would you guarantee such a thing?

Not like you need a car to get around, we are not talking about cities build around the car.

What he is saying is when and if most stores and people accept bitcoin as payment you might as well get paid in bitcoin instead of fiat currency. At that point the companies might as well just hold the bitcoin they get from transactions. Of course that will not happen this year, stuff like that takes some time.
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:18:18
Of course their are people 50+ that have more knowledge than most if not all talking here right now, how ever I would argue that they are not a majority among the group of people with an age above 50.
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:16:41


Haha you wish, there will always be wars :/
@_date: 2014-09-20 17:18:39
Paypal takes something like 3 % and is a cost for you regardless if you can see it or not.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:38:10
Oh so you think the ongoing war in Syria would not have happened if there was no fiat currency? Come on, I'm all for bitcoin but lets not get delusional it will not stop humans from starting any wars.
@_date: 2014-12-13 21:50:22
They do take their time but you can expect the stuff they release to be of really good quality.
@_date: 2015-05-12 12:17:07


? yeah that would be what the people who makes the microwave does. Programming is not something everyone knows, not that strange.
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:46:30


Really? Sure lots of people have shitty connections but not that shitty? :O And in any case if you are running a mining rig you should probably have a decent connection? 
But yeah the real problem is when the size increases it also means the entire chain gets insanely much bigger to download and store. But even 100 Mb alone isn't really that much tbh, you should be able to handle that on even an ADSL/VDSL connection though handling the entire chain is more difficult at that size imo.
@_date: 2015-05-12 12:14:46
Yeah think about the property value!
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:34:37
Yeah and without that paypal fee the price would have been 97 dollars. Just because you do not see the cost doesn't mean it isn't there.

Indeed, to me gaming have absolutely nothing to do with gambling two very different things.
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:22:36
That is how capitalism works, when competition is really high the market is running at a loss till some companies eventually goes under and it stabilizes around a low margin of profit. If someone can make 10-15% profit (after calculating with inflation etc) it means that there isn't enough competition in the market place.

@_date: 2015-05-31 14:10:22
Fair enough :), yeah it somewhat problematic problem, the blockchain doesn't scale very well in it's current form.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:41:21
In a scenario where bitcoin is used as the main form of payment I find it hard how someone couldn't justify spending a day or two learning how to protect them selfs? You work 40 hours a week but cannot spend 8-16 hours one time to protect the money you earn? 
It is not logical at all, but on the other hand humans are stupid and passively does nothing until it's too late, ah well.
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:54:48
Red cross is a fucking scam organisation, at least the [Swedish one]( Would never ever give them money.
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:51:52
Well I would say that the problem is that your ISP have caps tbh not the bandwidth use. Netflixes refuses to implement offline play (IE let you download shows/movies to your drive) which I agree would be a nice feature, but it ain't going to happen.
@_date: 2015-04-19 21:37:54


yeah no that certainly is not the problem, you are sending video files they are big nothing you can do about that, that they ain't already doing. Netflix sucks because of region locking AND they want to push for DRM in html5, but they are currently the best legal alternative on the market. Kinda sad when you think about it.
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:56:35


datacaps on none mobile connections are unheard of in my country. 


Offline play / local caching is from a technical standpoint the same thing.
@_date: 2015-04-21 13:59:43
It's not really about the laws though? There is nothing illegal to sell your content through digital downloads, that is done via itunes and steam every day. This is all bureaucracy and old stupid companies that cannot get their head out of their asses and get with the times.
@_date: 2015-04-18 12:59:28


You can absolutely do that, but unless you can defend said land with force if necessary you are probably going to have a hard time keeping it.

It is if you don't live in USA

Fiat currency does not work without computers either, you might be able to exchange small amounts between individuals but the entire system would collapse without computers. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 16:27:14
read the title again...
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:55:53
That is honestly not a good idea, and I don't think different currencies are that confusing for people. Paypal use several currencies for example there doesn't seems to be any problems there. Writing a $ sign when the amount is in Bitcoin is just confusing and gives you the wrong impression. Also, most people in the world does not use dollars.

Humans do love revolutions
@_date: 2015-02-12 00:19:58
wow that seems weird to me, but then again there are also plenty of people who think that the WWW is the internet.
@_date: 2015-02-12 00:13:12
at the moment anyway
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:26:10
Spotify used to do it, they switched off the network in 2014 though.
Skype was running it in the beginning as well, not sure how it works now though.
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:32:46


The thing is that still happens, patents are completely useless unless you have the capital to defend them in long outdrawn court cases, and even then that might not help. Take the Swedish inventor Håkan Lans for example, [he have been locked into insanely costly and long disputes and gotten nothing from it]( 
Patents does not help the lone inventor, they stifle innovation and makes sure big companies can control the market even more.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:57:54


Yeah good luck...
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:56:42
The chines have a very tight control of their currency and have a fixed exchange-rate to the dollar to keep the value low so they can sell / produce a lot of cheap stuff.
