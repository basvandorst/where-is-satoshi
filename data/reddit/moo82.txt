It's intellectually dishonest to restrict the block size and not define the exact requirements for a block size increase. Without those requirements clearly outlined, the restriction is arbitrary and most probably just the desire of a self interested partisan group.

Yeah, man...move that over to electrum NOW!  electrum.org.  
You can use any wallet that will show you the private keys to your addresses in reality though.  When this is all over, you can just import those into the wallet of your choosing on ANY bitcoin chain.  If there is a split, you'll have all money on ALL chains.

You just said the requirement was Segwit.  You're going to get Segwit.  Now what are the requirements for a block size increase after Segwit?  Remember, it's intellectually dishonest to restrict the block size and not define the exact requirements for a block size increase. Without those requirements clearly outlined, the restriction is arbitrary and most probably just the desire of a self interested partisan group.
@_date: 2017-07-09 02:32:16
So after Segwit the block size should increase to 100MB?
@_date: 2017-07-09 00:09:48
That's a misdirection.  The exact requirements for a block size increase must be defined.  Once Segwit goes through, this is even more pressing.

It's intellectually dishonest to restrict the block size and not define the exact requirements for a block size increase.  Without those requirements clearly outlined in detail the restriction is arbitrary and very probably just the desire of a self interested partisan group.
