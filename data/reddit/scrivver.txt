I can't speak to the actual efficacy of the methods, but there's always also crypto-anarchism, which seeks to replace and invalidate the state in many ways, and just requires voluntary participation. One of the hopes of that methodology, since decades ago, is that by popularizing anonymous encrypted economic exchange, it can frustrate states enough (through lack of taxation) to either defund and shrink/phase them out or force them to play the part of the villain exercising obvious violence against peaceful people.
We've never seen anything like it in practice, but widespread crypto -- and especially cryptocurrency -- is a huge part of it, and it's a neat idea. I would definitely prefer peacefully building a voluntary "exit" to a political system than destroying or coercing others to leave it. But this is all *quite* the rabbit trail from the original topic by now.

Unfortunately, the theory of democracy fails to account for the legitimacy of political authority in the first place (in a group of three, two wolves do not gain the rights to dictate the fate of the lamb because democracy legitimized it), so saying we have democratic means to change some policy doesn't constitute a justification for the policy's existence.

It isn't even difficult. This has been done before, even in the US. The half-penny was worth more than today's dime -- you see any of those in circulation? Many countries have eliminated their pennies (or equivalents) with no issues whatsoever. All it could possibly do is save millions of $ per year, *not* counting all the value saved by not transacting in it/managing it in circulation anymore.

In other words, "competing"? Isn't that just what markets do? By that logic, most other coins are "bribing" in this same way.

A banking license is just a license to do those financial acts which are considered criminal for anyone else to do. Welcome to statism and cronyism.

Just use a technology originally conceived, described, and designed by cypherpunks/crypto-anarchists which was openly expected to completely vex systems of taxation.
And remember not to do any of that stuff with it.

One option could be to export your keys/seed to a cold wallet, something physically tamper-resistant which lacks the ability to spend from it (if all you care about is the long term storage). Stuff like [this](

Unfortunately for this case (but fortunately for security reasons), the private keys used by the ledger are generated and locked within the secure element and are not imported or exported from it. So the only way to send BTC to your ledger is via the blockchain. Currently this can be... Difficult, as you've noted. But it also supports other, less stumbling coins if you have those as well.

The Live Free or Die state. For anyone who doesn't know, that's their state motto. They seem to be living up to it.

Well many US states might as well be entire countries. My home state is more than 2x the population of Belgium, and more than 5x the population of Norway for example...
So I'd still be excited.

Yeah, that is far from the worst thing about the Hillary campaign/presidential prospect. I'm opposed to a Trump presidency, but I would be in even more disbelief if people actually voted Hillary in and breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they dodged a bullet, rather than throw up in their mouths when they realize what they're stuck with.
It is incredible how she's managed to avoid looking so bad simply because she's "not Trump". The American people forgot how fucked they were when they managed to somehow pick a side between Tweedledee and Tweedledum, instead of *throwing out* the two candidates that *nobody* wanted in the first place.

Having had conversations with some of this "next generation" about many of the serious matters you're alluding to, it can feel really hopeless -- but not because they simply don't *care*, but because they know jack squat to begin with. People like us live in a certain kind of environment, with a shared awareness of (and interest in) a lot of events of particular types.
Just trying to find someone outside my environment who knows *anything at all* about the Snowden leaks is all but impossible, other than the usual "There was a guy named Snowden, and he leaked some stuff" and maybe "he's a hero/traitor and should be pardoned/hanged". You and I would think, given the incredible consequences of the programs detailed in those leaks, that people would and should care to do something about it. And when I actually get a chance to sit down with someone and illustrate the leaks for them, they usually have the same incredulous reaction. And now they *do* care. But they simply never knew something that I basically take for granted.
I have run into one guy who blatantly admitted he didn't care, or didn't see it as his place to do anything at all, even when everything was revealed to him, but most people do care once the scale and truth of the matter is impressed upon them. But they don't already live in the same kind of world you and I do, where we seek out this kind of stuff, and mass media (and the lack thereof) does a good job of keeping people unaware. 
It's cliche, and I don't want it to come off as but the concept that people really need to "wake up" has truth to it. So many people are asleep and in the dark, but aren't resistant to what you want. There are just so many of them that it's hard to wake them all up if you're going one at a time.

I'm so sorry, man. I recently got a couple hardware wallets (Ledger Nano S and Trezor) to compare and avoid this exact scenario. I'll only keep a small immediately-spendable amount on my phone, with the rest in hardware wallet accounts or cold storage. Hindsight is 20/20, and it hurts, but I hope this helps you moving forward. Pick up one of those and you'll be alright even if your device is riddled with bitcoin-stealing malware.

Tweet them! They'll probably pay attention to public cries like that, if they want to avoid looking like a scam. Another guy had a similar problem get resolved just a day or so ago here on the sub.
