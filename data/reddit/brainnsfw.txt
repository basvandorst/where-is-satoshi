Even though I'm no lawyer, am Dutch, yet still can't understand this 100%, let me at least clarify some parts so there's sufficient context here:
* The defendant (Koinz Trading B.V.) was previously ordered to pay 0.591 BTC (mining rewards) to the plaintiff. This had to be paid in BTC because this was simply the original agreement.
* The plaintiff in this particular hearing was a lawyer. No other entity was named.
* The subject of the hearing was to declare bankruptcy, requested by the plaintiff. 
* Dutch law states that bankruptcy can be requested either by the owner (defendant in this case) or a creditor. In the case of a creditor, certain proof is required (this is important soon).
* The court originally set a fine (in a previous hearing) up to a maximum of 10,000 euro's if the defendant did not pay the BTC. In the case of a bankruptcy though, fines can't be enforced by court.
* Because the court won't be able to enforce the fine if the request for bankruptcy is granted, the only remaining option is to pay the claim in bitcoins. However, the court can only grant this claim in bitcoins IF it is a verifiable claim.
* The next bit basically explains bitcoins to the court. Important is 1 sentence: "As such, bitcoins represent value and are transferable.". Due to the wording it isn't inherently clear if this is a case made by the plaintiff or a conclusion from the court. I'm leaning towards option 1 though, because of the sentence following immediately after (next bullet).
* The statement immediately after: "In the eyes of the court, it seems to carry the hallmarks of a property right. A claim in bitcoins can thus be seem as verifiable.". This effectively means the court can enforce the claim during the bankruptcy proceedings.
* The next part is a long way of saying that plaintiff handed over proof that the defendant hasn't paid anything and that the plaintiff is not alone in this regard (recurring theme). This is enough proof for the court to grant the request to bankruptcy.
* It all pretty much ends in stating a bankruptcy procedure will start.
So TL;DR: 
* Court hearing is regarding a request for bankruptcy (made by plaintiff).
* Debt has to be paid in bitcoins only because this was clearly the value agreed upon previously. In other words, there was no mention of the fiat value this represented at the time, thus no lame cop out. This does NOT mean the court decided that bitcoin is a real currency; the court is simply neutrally stating that this was the value both parties agreed upon. If it didn't involve bitcoins, but pokemon cards to be paid, the court would've made the same decision.
* The case presented to the court lets them conclude that transfer of bitcoins is verifiable. This simply means that the plaintiff can prove the debt was 1) agreed upon and 2) not yet paid. For reference: if the plaintiff said he was owed 10,000 euro's in cash, it would NOT have been a verifiable claim because there's no way to prove the cash was paid or not (different story if it involved a wire transfer obviously).
So while technically positive news in that the court hasn't dismissed the claim because it was bitcoins, it's simply neutral as to what bitcoins actually are. That bitcoins are a verifiable means of exchange shouldn't be news to us, but that alone doesn't equal "official financial asset".
