Yes. I looked at Amazon and other sites. But I heard they come direct from China and takes like a month to arrive. Is that how long it took for you?

I'm at the Wallet page and I entered my Identifier then clicked on open wallet. Afterwards a bunch of html popped up. I can't log in.

They are managing risk. They are better at building mining rigs than investing in Bitcoin. Therefore minimizing their risk. They don't know the future of bitcoin.

I was able to find a local copy of wallet.aes.json. I am using MultiBit now. On the "Import Private Keys" tab, I selected file then put in my blockchain.info password. Unlock was successful. I see in the "Import file" area-&gt;Replay date says, "There were missing dates. Have to go back to genesis block."  I clicked on "Import private keys" and an error message says, "The private keys import failed. The error was "com.google.bitcoin.store.BlockStoreException java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelExcpetion". I closed MultiBit and started over. This time when I click on "Importing private keys", it says completed successfully. I'm guessing I have to wait until the synchronizing with network is finished.

Normif, well thought out post!! And Litecoin has peeked some [interest]( recently! Now it needs more people using it to [buy goods and services!](

High end GPU miners will be replaced by ASIC miners because it's more efficiency.
Therefore, GPU miners will either sell their gear or start mining other crypto currencies like Litecoin which does not benefit from the ASIC architecture at the moment.
