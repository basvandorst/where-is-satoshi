This is true, will actually try to do this as the home insurance thing does not sound like it will work out.

Yes the wallet is encrypted, kaspersky, malwarebytes, and avg free all were unable to find a keylogger. However I found in my started a sysdir.exe which looked suspicious, and i went to the path it was located at, "C:\ProgramData\SysApp" and it had sevral config files that I was able to open up and they appear to be a keylogger, one of the logs read as below.
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
    &lt;configSections&gt;
        &lt;sectionGroup name="applicationSettings" type="System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsGroup, System, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"&gt;
            &lt;section name="Keylogger.Properties.Settings" type="System.Configuration.ClientSettingsSection, System, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089" requirePermission="false"/&gt;
        &lt;/sectionGroup&gt;
    &lt;/configSections&gt;
    &lt;applicationSettings&gt;
        &lt;Keylogger.Properties.Settings&gt;
            &lt;setting name="Keylogger_TheBestKeyloggerWebReference_Service" serializeAs="String"&gt;
                &lt;value&gt;
            &lt;/setting&gt;
        &lt;/Keylogger.Properties.Settings&gt;
    &lt;/applicationSettings&gt;
&lt;startup&gt;&lt;supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.0"/&gt;&lt;/startup&gt;&lt;/configuration&gt;

Original post of how i got my coins stolen and how you can keep it form happening.
The original address that my coins were taken from, the transaction of the stolin coins is the sent amount of 4.3 BTC.

This was not a flaw in bitcion, this was user error, just like if i lost an envelope full of cash, im not getting that back. Go find a new bridge to troll under sir ;)

This is true, as I said I found the original .exe file and the install file and uploaded it to   and not even 1 of the 59 AV programs detected it as a virus/keylogger.
@_date: 2014-12-15 06:50:36
Agree 100% like I said in my reply to him, this was not a fault in bitcoin but only my own user error.

There are keyloggers for linux....

I simply use MS's built in RDP with the RDP port forwarded to that machine.  But there were no records in event viewer for any RDP attempts. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 11:34:36
I have records of all bitcoin transactions and dates and the price of bitcoin the date i sold/purchased/mined/traded them.
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:19:36
I didnt even know that was a thing.
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:38:30
Sad thing is I kept it on bitcoin core because I didnt trust online services, but if i would have had it all in my blockchain.info account I would still have my BTC thanks to two-factor. The irony.

I found the sysdir2.exe was still in my recycling bin.  I have uploaded the link for it
There is also a logs.ic and settings.ic in the recycling bin as well, could I use this information to get any info from the thief?
@_date: 2014-12-15 06:51:02
You forgot to list my tears as one of the ingredients ;)
@_date: 2014-12-15 06:23:20
Honestly that is what I am still baffled about.  It was on a computer I use very very little, only to make a bitcion transactions.  I have not downloaded anything on it in months.  However I did notice when my BTC was gone my antivirus was disabled also. Only thing I can think of is some sort of drive-by download but I don't even recall ever having a UAC popup (its a win7 machine).  I have other computers in my home that I use for everything not bitcoin related.  And they all came up clean on AV scans.

I know it is not rocket science but its always good to get a second opinion before accidentally making a fool of yourself
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:37:14
The actual sysdir.exe is not there, the sysdirinstaller is the link is below 
Also here is a link of all files in the directory
