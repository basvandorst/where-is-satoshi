I wasn't planning on getting his special, but I will if he takes Bitcoin for it.

Very Cool!  We are a Bitcoin Development team with an office at a co-working space.  Do you plan on selling these? How much would it cost to get one of these set up ourselves?

Hey, Peter, the CEO of CoinLab here.
TL;DR I can tell you much more on skype / phone, drop me a line at peter
In brief, though, you could (depending on the speed of your cluster) put a node or two in place and talk to a pool manager or the satoshi bitcoind client to get work, then pass it on.
There are a couple of gotchas that might mean you don't want to do either of those; in particular, pools typically set difficulty to "1", or about one successful 'share' every 8 to 10 gigahash-seconds. If your cluster is fast, you're going to have communication troubles like that.
On the other hand, the satoshi bitcoind isn't really tuned for this either -- it will send work out to you, but it's not great at managing monster numbers of individual work units, and doesn't count shares.
All that to say, drop me a line -- we have a solution for you, and could get you bitcoins back (pay per share) or hard currency if you prefer; we have a system that will quote and pay computation back in a number of fiat and virtual currencies.

Call your credit card company and tell them that you need to reverse the charge because the seller never delivered the digital goods you purchased.  
The nice thing about non-bitcoin payments is they are reversible :-P

We're listening to your album at the office right now.  Great stuff! [(tweeted)](
@_date: 2012-04-24 18:08:01
I agree!

How do you get to a .bit address?  Is there a web portal?
@_date: 2012-05-07 17:27:02
I like the QR code links! Printed and posted in our office. Thanks for the mention.

Once you get Bitcoins working, will they show up in the leaderboard?  I'd love to see 3 BTC above the $20 donations :-)

I believe Dwolla now has a 30-day waiting period for new accounts to transfer to Gox and other Bitcoin-related services.  
@_date: 2012-08-10 00:00:16
CoinLab definitely needs one of these :-P

"I would argue that if people had a choice in currency, whether they be rich, middle income, or poor, they would have a way to park their income and wealth in an alternative medium of exchange and unit of account, that they could have greater security of: that it's value is more certain and stable based upon their fears and expectations about the trend that their own national currency is following."

I will be doing an AMAA here tomorrow; I'll keep everyone posted.
@_date: 2012-09-27 23:21:58
Theymos comments seemed great; worth discussing at the very least. I'm hoping to talk about them in an AMA tomorrow.

Interestingly we've had two platinum sign-ups and no gold so far. 
@_date: 2012-08-04 00:09:49
This is a very cool business model :-)
@_date: 2012-08-04 00:22:42
What about MTGox's green address?

This is not vaporware; someone broke our press embargo a day early so all the communications are unfortunately not teed up properly..
 Mark et al are sleeping right now in Japan, but they'll confirm this soon.

That's a sensible perspective if you're privacy paranoid. Most of our employees trade at exchanges that require personal documentation because they trust them more; that said, almost none use exchanges as their storage of last resort. 
@_date: 2013-02-27 21:57:25
This is true.

It'll be one transparent order book for Gox/CL customers.

This is not true; Jinyoung is a full-time employee of the Foundation. I can say that, while new to Bitcoin, she's super enthusiastic about it, and wants to do a good job at this. She's also smart and interested, so feel free to send her polite comments or improvement suggestions, I'm sure she'd appreciate them.
@_date: 2013-02-27 22:00:17
Yes, there are lots of pieces of the American business that nobody overseas wants to deal with. :) So, condolences / congrats might be more appropriate. :)

I wouldn't say I'm particularly greedy. 
What's hard for a lot of people to understand is that Bitcoin prices today could be set by any one of hundreds of NYC hedge fund managers, just for fun, with their bonus money.
The only way to protect Bitcoin is get liquidity numbers up into the hundreds of millions of dollars on the book. 
If you have other ways to do that, I'm all ears.

I hope you stick with us. What we intend is to leverage the existing security and exchange, and improve parts of the process. It will look like Mt. Gox at the beginning, and be cleared on the same exchange, it will just be easier to get your money in and out, and hopefully account signups will become much easier and faster.
@_date: 2013-03-02 05:26:59
Yep, this is correct.
