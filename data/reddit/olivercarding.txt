Thanks for the nice words. Austin was a great interviewee and definitely one of the most interesting people I've been able to talk to about Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-12-10 18:23:09
"Unfortunately, a lot of the discussions about private chains are very shallow and not very informed, you have some people who think they’re just databases, that they have no benefit, you have some people who say that Bitcoin as a public chain is the only one that’ll ever work and everything else will fail, where in fact that entire conversation is broken and shallow, it’s like going back to 1994 and saying you deployed TCP/IP on an intranet, that’s not the internet! We don’t talk that way these days, you just say you’re using the internet and using a common protocol and how they’ve used it differs dependent on their needs. Some people are using IPV6 to route to long haul mobile data on very large fibre networks that don’t route public TCP/IP but it’s still part of the internet, it’s all using the same protocol and that’s the more interesting potential future."

I am not suggesting that it resulted in them receiving millions of followers etc, Bitcoin is still not mainstream. I am showing that following the announcement the amount of followers began to increase.

If "satoshis" was changed this could turn into a good little marketing campaign.

Been topping up my stash for weeks using Circle for iPhone. I wish they would market it a bit better towards those new/ inexperienced with Bitcoin as it's so simple to use and would definitely help those who are interested but think that Bitcoin is "too confusing" 
Edit: Should mention I am from the UK

I'd totally be up for this if it was for a general Bitcoin advert. But do I really want to donate to what is essentially a companies marketing budget in the name of Bitcoin? Not really.
@_date: 2014-06-12 11:46:57
Thanks, glad you liked it. I thought the same, and theorised that it could be something to do with manual action and being wary and removing links as updates rolled out as I know they've been penalised in the past due to some pretty spammy techniques. Good to see they are properly earning links this time.

I had a terrible experience using the ATM in the Manchester, Arndale store yesterday. It was out of BTC and kept asking that I put in less than £10 even though it wouldn't accept less. I have had positive experiences buying with Bitcoin through CEX's website though.

Stuart Fraser is Iris Cantor’s nephew and is the VC of Cantor Fitzgerald. He's definitely a real person, but whether or not he knows about this shit storm is another thing entirely. Someone should bring this to his attention though he does seem to have been dealing with GAW for a while, prior to their involvement in Bitcoin, back when they were Great Auk Wireless.

Agreed! Coinfire was the best Bitcoin news site in my opinion, Mike and his team had a good understanding on the technology and really promoted journalistic integrity. Shameless plug, but Coinjournal.net promotes similar values. Check us out

I'm optimistic we will see a resolution within the next fortnight

I want to remain unbiased, but in this instance: We discussed that with Austin in December. Apparently, all Blockstream employees have a clause written into their contracts where their work should always be in line with the values of Bitcoin. If Blockstream were to ask them to develop something that goes against the principals then they'd be able to resign and still receive pay.

We accept donations because quality, well researched content is expensive and advertising doesn't pay the bills. There is a very limited pool of legitimate Bitcoin or cryptocurrency companies that invest in advertising.
We regularly get advertising requests from scammers and companies who could potentially put our readers at risk and value the quality of our content and ethics over making a "quick buck". 
Legitimate Bitcoin companies: Please consider advertising with smaller sites that value their readership. 
Readers: If you enjoy reading Coinjournal and can afford it, please drop us a few bits next time you read a story that you enjoy. Our donation address is listed on that page 
Thanks,

Our response to McCrum's sloppy journalism: 
@_date: 2016-12-27 12:31:10
Shameless plug but  was founded from people having similar issues with "Crypto media". We spend a lot of time conducting research before we'll write about any company and pride ourselves on the quality and accuracy of our content. 
We publish infrequently due to the costs of decent content and turning down a high percentage of those that approach us about advertising.
One of the biggest issues we find is that legitimate companies in the space don't market their products/services properly and have no marketing budgets. 
Anyway, check us out, we are probably the best Bitcoin news site that you've never heard of.

Advertising should be led by those selling their products/ services in the space. 
The amount of companies that properly market their products is depressingly low.

Great to see miningpool.co.uk included on here which is a site I'm involved with. Thanks, I will get a donation sent over when I'm at my desk tomorrow. 
Like others have said: It's expensive to run a decent news site. Donations account for very little, making it impossible to run without advertising. We've had offers in the past to feature products in return for cash, but we aren't interested. Carefully vetted banner ads and the odd affiliate link are the only type of advertising we will accept. When a website starts offering to promote any product for a price the quality instantly drops. 
For anyone interested: We are planning on rebranding in the next few months. The site was originally started to put an exact match domain to good use and just featured mining news. Frankly the name sucks and with having some of the best writers in the industry writing for us it makes sense to give ourselves a more professional image. 
Thanks again :)

Thanks for the positive feedback, but slight misconception: CoinJournal has never tried for investment, though we did try running an ad-free model which didn't work. 
We have had offers of investment/ acquisition in the past, and though the valuation was good and acceptable, we never felt comfortable with those making the offers and the direction that this would potentially take us in. 
Sorry you don't like the logo. You're not the only one, and it doesn't work with lighter colors and as a result had some new branding done a while back, but it's taking a while to roll out. Some elements are used on our social media and in the promotional items we've done lately.
To the person(s) attacking us for having adverts on the site. Do you have any idea how publishing actually works? Do you think that journalists write for free? The site is actually largely funded by myself and subsidised by adverts. We do our best to ensure that we are not promoting scams, even blocking sites served by Doubleclick on a daily basis.
On the point of what sites should be trusted/read. I am not going to personally attack any other sites in the space, but I only really read Bitcoin Magazine. Most of my learning is now done by listening to Podcasts.

The whole campaign was pretty poorly orchestrated. There were so many better ways the company could have spent their money. Even on the game night the whole thing was terrible from a social media point of view. It was really sloppy and they missed a lot of opportunities. The sponsorship never felt like a "game changer" for me anyway, but aside from that the marketing around the event was poor. 
It's my number 1 biggest gripe with Bitcoin companies, they market terribly!

The 1st batch of Kncminer came out around that period. The ROI was insane. I was running roughly 2 TH/s which was returning around 1.5 Btc a day (From memory). It was when they did the reseller scheme too, so the machines cost me a lot less than retail.

I've never personally had a problem with Circle. It's the easiest and quickest way to buy small amounts of Bitcoin in the UK by far.
