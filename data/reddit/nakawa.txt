Scary stuff

poor old woman - I feel so sorry for those normal people. They worked there whole life, and now ? What a mess.

you had problems with your kraken account before , when adding deposits or requesting withdrawals ? May be it's only you, someone posted already [here!](

a vanity plate saying 'bitcoin' doesn't necessarily scream anything, but could mean anything. Most probably it's a bitcoin lover - so WTF is wrong with that?

OP seems to refer to the few large stake holders
[Bitcoin Distribution by Address!](
So currently 19.66% of all Bitcoins in existence are be held in only 98 bitcoin addresses.
And we can not know how many of those 98 addresses' private keys are being controlled by how many different people.
In fact, those people have ( not only in theory ) the power to influence the bitcoin price and quite related it's volatility.
They may start moving out some coins and immediate FUD spreads. They sell a couple of 10's of thousand of their coins on exchanges which results in the price going to south.
Sure, so called professional bitcoin traders always may make money out of volatility. But thinking bigger we know that is not exactly what Bitcoin currently needs to get globally accepted, not only by merchants but by the average Joe.
So I am not saying it would make any sense, but the power is in a few hands. We tend to ignore that. We shouldn't. That's what I think.

There are many out there, but most are not reliable.
I hear good things about a guy names Dr. Heinrich Vollmer alias
 on twitter
[google that guy!](
AFAIK he buy / sell in bulk p2p
no bad reputation so far

And what comes next ? Asking for selfies when people want to withdraw - that would be it 
May be they just do it for so called suspicious accounts to prevent id theft
I guess I need to find another way to exchange btc/eur may be p2p but with trustful people
even escrow services can be fraudulent, and run with your coins or delay for months

where do you see they use okpay ?
If they did, they are doomed from the beginning.

 Enough room for a scam.
If this model is getting popular, users of exchange will store lots of their fiat money in OKPAY.
OKPay just needs to wait until amount is large enough and then ... BOOM
( remember the stormpay.com disaster back in 2006 January busted due to the collapse of 12dailypro.com hyip ?)

does it mean that - IF all the good news which have appeared in the last months, the bitcoin price would have dropped already to say below than 100$, 
and it is only above it because we have seen these continously good news for the last months ?

he will find a way to make it

Didn't you forget to mention with which method you encoded the message in the first place ?
