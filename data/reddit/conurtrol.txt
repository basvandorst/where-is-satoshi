Bitcoin currently represents 90.6% of all cryptocurrency equity. The other 9.4% is divided among more than 500 altcoins. I think it takes a fascist mentality to want to destroy all those coins and tie everything to bitcoin through altchains. Any increase in network effect will be negligible but suppresion of development and creativity is a real concern.

They are trying to use bitcoin's near-monopoly power to give the borg-like ultimatum "assimilate or die". If you don't join, they will just clone you anyways. Do you think that type of environment leads to passionate innovation?
@_date: 2014-10-22 23:14:00
Ok, so now that you know what I meant, what is your response? I'll reiterate: Why create a new innovative coin if the monopoly is going to steal it and clone it(and possibly modify it so as to be non-differentiating) for a sidechain? How many brilliant people are attracted to this space by the lure of creating something amazing and getting rich doing it? Why would they stick around? Are you saying that an innovative coin could be created in such a way that it wouldn't be at risk?

If an innovative altcoin does not want to be a sidechain then will it be cloned?
@_date: 2014-10-22 23:03:55
To be taken seriously they would have to open source it and then it would be immediately stolen and cloned for a sidechain of the big monopoly coin. Why would they bother in the first place? I'm not saying that no one would ever do it but just that the effect on innovation will be stifling.

Afraid of shadows? Destroy everything.
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:21:51
Do you see how this might stifle innovation? Why create something if the monopoly is just going to steal it. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:53:48
Perhaps I misunderstand your meaning with the word "differentiating". I was referring to altcoins that have a new feature not found in bitcoin. What was your meaning?
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:00:48
Here is what I think will happen based on reading the relevant bitcointalk threads awhile back. Perhaps things have changed but here goes:
Bitcoiners decide they like the innovative features of 5 altcoins. They create 5 sidechains, take a bitcoin blockchain snapshot, and distribute the new sidechain assets accordingly. Is this a realistic approximation of what you expect?
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:32:37
I'm specifically talking about altcoins that are differentiating. Why create one if the monopoly is going to steal it? How many brilliant people are attracted to this space by the lure of creating something amazing and getting rich doing it? Why would they stick around?
@_date: 2014-10-22 21:19:10
Don't believe the hype. That is a marketing slogan they are using to justify their actions. Their initial and primary goal was to destroy altcoins. Go on bitcointalk and look at how they talk about alts and the alt section. Words like "dirty", "filthy", "scammers", and "swamp" are quite common. They found a way to potentially exterminate them while pretending to be the good guys. Bitcoiners will go along with it because they see dollar signs.

So when I say that this project will steal innovation and equity from altcoins while suppressing future innovation, would you agree?

This is revolutionary tech from a well respected developer with the credentials to pull it off. He's not going to open source it until XCurrency is complete and securely positioned. His months old REV 1 tech has already been cloned multiple times so why take the chance of getting ripped off after all the work that has gone into this? There will be code reviews by established experts and a very large bounty for anyone who can defeat the privacy of the completed XCurrency.

Fascist attempt by bitcoin people to steal all the innovation and equity from altcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-23 00:40:01
You are talking about alts that are "straight clones" that have "no distinguishing features". I'll ask for the last time: Why create a new innovative coin if the monopoly is going to steal it and clone it(and possibly modify it so as to be non-differentiating) for a sidechain? How many brilliant people are attracted to this space by the lure of creating something amazing and getting rich doing it? Why would they stick around? Are you saying that an innovative coin could be created in such a way that it wouldn't be at risk?

Wall Street Journal reporter choices:
1. Present an honest picture of a complex subject.
2. Advance a political agenda and scare people at the same time?
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:11:10
Ok, will the current equity of altcoin stakeholders be respected or will the altcoin be cloned and owned only by those who transfer bitcoin into the sidechain?

Monero has a feature called a "Viewkey". You can give someone a viewkey to see your transactions, but the transactions are still invisible to everyone else. This would allow companies to keep their financial dealings private but still comply with regulatory agencies when necessary.
