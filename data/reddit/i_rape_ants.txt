Where I live you have to register your name when you buy a TV. You then get billed $400 a year as long as you have it. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 10:16:59
Well it's still use of the network even if it's just long chains being sent forwards. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 15:19:09
Not sure either, but that is the last thing I'd ever do. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:30:30
It is decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:39:21
How much do you want to bet? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:58:23
First of all, calling it "bcash" is immature and unnecessary. And that comes from someone with my username.
Second, you seem to be incredibly certain of exactly what would happen if he dies. And I very much disagree with you. The price would possibly go down, maybe by a lot. But long term I think it would keep on chugging as long as people have value left in it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:47:41
It's 100% false. Sure, he seems to like it and promote it, but it wouldn't stop existing if he left this earth. You're spreading 100% propaganda. 
Just to be clear, I own more btc than bch, and will probably continue to do so. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:35:51
Why would you say that, it's not true at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:09:13
Sure you *can* call it what you want and you *can* ask him to do that, but all it does is make this whole crypto environment worse to be a part of. Nothing good comes from it, at least nothing I can see. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 16:20:40
That's awesome, let's hope more big players help the network by doing this. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:20:33
Oh my you are quite the twister. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:00:21
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:17:44
Exactly. You'll never mine 0.34 btc with that equipment, and with electricity you are effectively paying ~318 dollars for 0.34 btc. Just buy bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2015-12-13 22:22:48
About $90k now. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:06:58
 No information there either. Very strange.
@_date: 2015-12-28 00:31:32
Nope

Lol man, he's suckin' some sweets. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 21:04:11
It's possibly you getting hacked, move your coins to a safe place asap and change all passwords and activate 2fa.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:11:36
Well look at you now  :P
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:43:31
I'm not sure of the details, but something like this has been proposed. I'll see if I can find a link.
Edit:  
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:30:03
Yeah, I'm sure he has a quite calm schedule nowadays. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 22:17:01
Huh, that's pretty awesome! Did this happen relatively recently? It doesn't feel like too long ago I last read something negative to bitcoin from him.

@_date: 2015-06-25 22:32:42
If he paid with his phone, he would have had to transfer the snapshot of the qr code to another device, then take a picture with his wallet. I hope there's a solution for this soon. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:15:24
My fear is that Gavin and other devs might get burnt out by all these politics holding them back. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:16:09
That's pretty much what the article is about. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:17:15
Thanks right back! First time gold receiver, finally I can see what it's all about :) did the purchase go as planned? 
@_date: 2014-09-04 12:51:11
But still, if you buy that equipment it will never mine 1.2 btc during its lifetime. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 10:19:16
Please take my word: you'll never get your 1.2 btc back. Just hold on to them!

@_date: 2014-06-27 19:11:48
WHAT HAPPENED!? 
@_date: 2014-01-22 11:35:10
That does not make it flawed. It rewards early adopters, and in fact continues to increase in value so it is an attractive investment even in the future. Unless something horrible happens. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 11:58:35
Just sent you a few bits!

Lol, must be :-) 
@_date: 2014-04-13 16:28:50
I guess there wouldn't be a need for a "Litecoin" sidechain. My guess is that the succeeding chains will be the ones that serve a real purpose. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 08:21:12
0.0012 btc :) 
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:02:27
Sure, so like basically he just opens his wallet on his offline computer and creates a new wallet. The wallet then makes him a private key and a public key. He then sends some coins to his public key (bitcoin-address). The private keys stay offline and are only used to sign transactions later on if he wants to send some coins from that address. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 19:29:52

@_date: 2014-07-06 19:58:32
If you plan on using it for something public, you should perhaps get bitcoinm.com, bitcoimn.com as well. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 15:38:22
What the hell man, don't spread your shit opinion just to scare people. If you don't have anything smart to say just shut up.
@_date: 2014-07-13 19:21:49
You are jumping to conclusions. Renowned fraudster? Please explain. 
I don't have any money invested with them, and probably won't. But I see them (him?) as someone doing great work for the community, and getting bashed and threatened by jerks that may have lost money elsewhere in the past, and have become ultra-sceptic. I don't hope you guys scare away new developers/entrepreneurs from trying to create something new. 
If I'm wrong and this turns out to be a big scam I apologize, but none of the "evidence" has convinced me yet. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:12:19
The difficulty automatically adjusts. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:34:17
But still, imagine if he did sell at $800 and bought back at say $480. He could buy back his 2500 coins and still keep $800,000.

You should probably send out a new backup to everybody that has that activated. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:50:13
I don't think he means that a bot did it, but that some guy ready to jump on board wired a bunch of money to btc-e and spent it all on one buy, eating up the order books all the way up to this peak. The exchanges should have some sort of warning to the customer of about what's about to happen. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:33:59
Pure bitcoin businesses won't need bank accounts in the next years. All transactions will be in bitcoin. Regular bitcoin exchanges, of course, need to be connected with banks to work. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:25:05
Yeah, I saw that. But is there any plans on using them in some way? I think some went to the wizard ad some time ago. Does that still run? 
@_date: 2014-09-21 09:15:05
Circle is still invite only. But it will make it much easier to buy. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 22:58:30
I gave 0.1 btc to three of my colleagues and none of them seem to care. Let's see in a year or two.

@_date: 2014-10-28 20:23:07
So sad to see you go. 
I've used you regularly for both buys and sells, and really like your service much better than bitcoinsnorway. I wonder how long they'll stay in business with all this happening. 
You should contact VG or Dagbladet and tell them your story. The media seems interested in bitcoin. 
I hope this works out for you guys and that you'll relaunch in the near future :) Thanks for you've done so far!

Wow, didnt even occur to me. thanks! 
@_date: 2014-07-19 17:02:11
You're right, sorry for the off topic. 
I also spread the word on bitcoin, not because I think them buying in will increase the value of the few I hold, but because it might increase in price some time from now and this looks like a incredibly high risk high return investment. Of course I tell them that it's a very risky investment, if not they may lose money they can't afford. 
So I do it to possibly help my friends and family. So far only my brother-in-law and his dad have bought. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:13:13
Imagine that, VISA and MasterCard blocking Circle.
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:48:18

Okey.. let's hope he gets a bunch of bitcoin users in the times to come, nice to see at least some using it there :)

5-10 tickets they might not have sold otherwise, with fees and other benefits much better then any other payment method.

He would generate the private keys and calculate the public keys from them on an offline computer. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 21:26:43
But what if the protocol changes years from now and the transaction becomes invalid? 
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:59:45
Holy shit, not exactly the way I thought this would be like. My guess was SecondMarket getting the most expensive blocks, just because of the number of bidders there. Amazing.

Yeah, so $0.02 worth in bitcoin per day. Or (assuming the difficulty won't change (it will)) you'll get your money back in ~~5000 days~~.
Edit: divided by 20 of these coins, 250 days.

He praised the dogecoin guys in their sub a while back, so I guess maybe he has some of those. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:07:29
They will begin tracking them from the moment they receive the coins. What happened to them before will of course be your job to report.

Thank you, plenty of super tips. I think I'll start giving him something like $5 a week for him to save, he could follow the value and hopefully see them increase in value. I'll also give him 1 btc as soon as I can create a proper multisig paper wallet for him. 
Again, thank you for the ideas! 
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:02:38
Hi, and again thanks for the great service. 
What if users could donate to say Stackoverflow through changetip, but it would only be redeemable by them if they integrated bitcoin in one way or the other. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:52:51
Cool to see you guys do this ama.  
Just a thought, what if you made professional looking pdfs ready to print, with nice explanations of what bitcoin is and how it can benefit merchants, that we can print and hand out? I have seen some of these, but not well enough made to make a nice impression. 
Thanks for doing what you're doing! :)

Sorry for your loss, pretty cheap lesson though. 
Did you use two-factor authentication? If not, be sure you do next time. If you did have that activated, it could be your email that's been hacked and a copy of your blockchain.info wallet was stolen and cracked. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:48:56
Did you try? 
I bought with my european card a few weeks ago. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 15:09:15
Maybe they are making their own system for receiving bitcoins. There really is no need for a payment processer if they plan on keeping the coins. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 19:47:38
 pretty much what you're looking for I guess. 
Edit: it should be 20%
@_date: 2014-03-23 09:19:51
They are actually quite easy to make. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:44:04
What about the address to their site? QR codes are not unique to bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-05-04 20:41:45
Wow, thanks bud! I sure will ;-) 
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:13:40
Yeah, using a service like Blockchain.info he can enter his address and see his balance. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:13:33

My recommendation to you would have to be a Trezor. Keep the seed you write down during setup at a safe location. Then if you lose your Trezor, you can get your coins back. 
Just did this myself, and it really feels good to know they are safe. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:36:36
Sorry for your loss! May I ask how many you lost? 
@_date: 2014-05-03 18:18:58
The way I understand it is that the second "for sending"-password is the one the backup is encrypted with. Please correct me if I'm wrong!

Haha love these..
Keep em coming! :-) 
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:15:22
Yeah I see your point, and bitcoin is actually a lot like crack :) Pretty addictive. When I tip I hope it makes you interested and that you perhaps try to understand what this is. Not because it will make me rich, but because it's a really cool technology that might change a lot of things world-wide. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:28:45
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:04:00
Still applies for dogecoin.

Well say bitcoin reaches $10,000.. $100,000.. $1,000,000.. at what point do you change your mind? It's not a get rich scheme, it's just the rise of a new world currency. Of course the price has to follow.

Hopefully SHA256 will outlive us all. It's impossible to know what will happen, but I'm willing to take that risk. If other people fear that it will be "cracked" then they are free to invest their money elsewhere. I just hate when some people come to this subreddit and just spread their crap for whatever reasons they might have. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:43:39
"I wouldn't be surprised if the CIA/NSA could make fake bitcoins." 
That's just because you don't understand the technology.

If I'm not mistaken you can get some back on your taxes in some countries. But I agree with your statement. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:57:39
This is still Bitcoin in its infancy.
Of course it's volatile. It will continue to be for years to come, hopefully with a upwards trend. 
But I guess you are just trying to bash bitcoin and its users, and not even try to understand what's really happening. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 19:58:16
Now you can buy twice as much!

Are you paid to visit this sub?
I can't understand how anyone can be so negative to Bitcoin and then spend so much time here.
You sometimes write interesting things, but for the most part its stuff where you nitpick and just troll.
Do you understand Bitcoin and how it works? All of those great ideas working together to create it. Are you against that? Or the users? Why?

If you don't understand this, thanks for all your hard work! 
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:06:52
Awesome, I hope it works without any problems. 
I would recommend a Trezor for each. Help them out with the steps needed to properly secure them and store the backup seed somewhere safe. 
Then I would contact [Sturle]( I'm sure he can help you out! 
Good luck! 
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:45:00

  The miners pick all the transactions with sufficient fees,  together with a new one with 25btc to their chosen address, and makes a "file" with all the data in a specific order. They then make a hash of all the transactions, meaning they kind of encode it down to a much shorter string. They hash it together with a number, called the nonce. This is the number they try many different values of when they mine, looking for a hash that has X leading zeroes. When they find one that has enough, something looking like
00000000000000004a04db4d20417f2cb3f31961b2d6a87c2a8afd335c695f88, they release the file and the nonce, other miners check that this is correct and add it to their chain. Then the race starts again. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 16:19:47

@_date: 2014-05-31 19:37:42
He means send all your coins to a new address before you send then through the mixer, to keep no of inputs down to keep the fee down. Not sure if it's enough to effect the fee from the mixer though.

@_date: 2014-09-16 20:41:58
You could perhaps keep a small amount of the bitcoins, say 5-10%. It could pay off in the long run, if it doesn't you have only lost a relatively small sum of money. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 12:11:56
No shit Sherlock. 
Sorry. 
But yeah, they made sure to trigger it to buy a few cheap coins. Now that they are gone it's time to launch!

Great answer. Good luck, I'm sure you'll do great. Can't wait to hear how it goes. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 13:39:12
Remember to consider the difficulty increase. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 21:43:32
If millions of dollars are being pumped into bitcoin the price will go up as available coins are being bought. Then everybody profits on Wall Street whales' big buys. If they ever happen.

As you see your dollars (or whatever currency you hold your savings in) become worth less and less as years go by, and bitcoin swinging up and down but pushing upwards, you might begin to rethink how you want to keep your savings. 
Of course, bitcoin could plummet to $10 or less and die, but that doesn't look like the most probable scenario. 
Us early adopters take a big risk with a potentially huge reward. If you don't wish to do this, don't. But stop wasting everyones time with your shallow negativity. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:43:43
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:52:05
Ahh that must sting now. You can perhaps send a really small transaction to the same address and add a note where you ask for it back. It probably won't do anything but maybe one time in the future a company goes through their old addresses. 
It's going great, never been better. Thanks for asking! 
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:49:10

I agree with most of what you're saying. But all I can think about is black friday and the impending crash from all the coins spent and converted to usd. Maybe smart to sell now and rebuy after? Who knows. 
Edit: not talking about a $10 btc type crash, only a dip.

$2 for you to experiment with :) @_date: 2017-02-15 17:44:43
Changing from sha256 would be the worst possible option in my view. The miners will follow if they are presented with a proposal they agree to and from which they can make the most money. It's the way the system was designed to work, not that everyone was supposed to follow the devs of one implementation. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 11:37:28
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:10:29
Thanks for replying. 
Yeah, I've seen several but they have all been quite poorly worded and designed. I just feel we need some sort of PR material made by professionals.

My god, you did this?? what does a subscription for Entertainment Weekly cost??
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:15:29
Yeah the translation part would be a little difficult, maybe release them in English with a way of editing/translating it. Maybe if you have a website you could have a PR section that users can help translate. Sorry if I'm handing you guys all the work, maybe this is something I can start developing myself.

Time to eat that hat! :)
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:46:09
I agree with SpaceTire. Your initial post is quite rude.
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:00:33
You said it. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:10:20
If the USD was to fail, I definitely wouldn't sell my bitcoins for USD. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 09:25:23
Holy crap, thats a boatload of miners. What do those cost? That looks like a hell of an investment!

@_date: 2015-01-30 21:32:24
So if bitcoin ever hits 47k you'll sell them for dollars...? 
@_date: 2015-01-30 21:21:44
Walk around with thousands worth? Why would anyone do that? I have my long-term coins on a Trezor and keep a few bucks on my phone just in case I get to use them. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:51:04
Hi Ryan, sad to see you leave the reddit crew. 
I feel this idea is about 10 years late, most people (At least to my knowledge) already have access to internet at home, and away from home you usually have 3g or 4g access, making this pretty obsolete. 
I could be wrong and out of touch with the world, but I feel this is a waste of time on your end. 
For the good of the bitcoin ecosystem, things like openbazaar and lighthouse are projects that might need your expertise. 
If you want to make something new, how about... Well, what if you could make a complete automatic ad-system? Crowdsource it on lighthouse and hold on. I'll donate to that cause! 
Anyways, the best of luck to you! You seem like a talented developer!  Cheers. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:32:17
Not quite this much though. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:39:07

@_date: 2015-01-21 20:17:05
Awesome. Good luck. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:10:16
Same here, and it really bugs me. And I prefer the good old Baht-symbol. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 21:29:35
If bitcoin ever hits 47k I'll keep my stash in bitcoin, only exchanging to fiat when I need it. It'll probably be easier to use them as bitcoin NY then anyways. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:04:20
Never regretted buying a Trezor, the ease of mind is worth a lot more to me! And I'm sure SatoshiLabs now will think things over a few times first before they go live.
And I will never move my coins over to a wallet made by Chinese copy-cats. I'm not sure what backdoors they could hide in there, but just the thought of it scares me. Be careful people!
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:40:34

Pretty cool. I really liked the last one. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:20:47
Ahh of course. I feel like that is a mistake I could do. Thanks for clearing things up! 
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:56:05
Then you know more than enough. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:26:22
I doubt there is any automatic vote manipulation, it's users agreeing with Erik and disagreeing with you. It's bad reddiquette, but that's just how people are. I might be wrong, but consider the possibility. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 21:24:52
As we see again and again, the number of new subscribers here go in waves as the price goes up and down. If we get another rally, I'm sure more people will hit the subscribe button. The future of bitcoin does not rely on subscriber numbers.

Of course you get to see some bad behavior from the other side, the same thing happens on other less censored bitcoin subreddits from Core supporters. There's no way you can say that what you have been dealing with is a vocal minority, or a mostly silent majority. 
Many of the Core devs have made huge contributions to Bitcoin, no doubt. But to think that they are somehow now on top of it all and that they now are "official leaders" is just plain wrong. 
On a side-note, I remember when you got your mod status. I was so happy for you, and have always read your comments with much respect. I still do, and I believe you are a intelligent person that I hope soon will see the whole picture. Users wanting a biggier max block size != one homogenous group of horrible trolls. Stop spreading that image please. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:30:39
I'll take some lessons if you promise to read some of what the other side is saying. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:52:39
Sorry, I'm not sure I understand what you ment here. Do you believe that mining an empty block on top of a recently mined one is bad? 
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:04:07
Buy? 
@_date: 2016-01-09 20:34:25
Who says what Bitcoin is or isn't? Is that your decision? You make my blood boil with thoughtless comments like that. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 17:35:57
This really is about governance. Look at how "the other side" is being treated and how the Core devs/BS (plus helpers, you included) talk about the issue. You make it seem like it's a vocal minority screaming and being difficult only for the sake of being difficult. There really isn't any way to count who is the majority, but there are a lot of people on each side. 
The people in charge of the reference client want to stay in control, and many people (myself included) believe that is a problem after seeing how they have acted in the last year. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:27:10
That's a very arrogant stance, and it's a big part of the problem. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:17:16
Please refrain from calling ignorance when you seem to have a very shallow understanding of the issue. Rising fees is very far from the only problem. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:54:22
Some of us see what you are doing as spreading FUD, lies and helping extend the disagreement. Half the bashing posts on this sub are from you, come on. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 20:39:08
Sorry, I've never heard of the service. Is there a way to contact them and ask for help? If not, let's just hope they fix this and that you'll be able to withdraw later. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:03:58
Nah, we just have pretty much the exact opposite view of the situation. But I'm pretty sure we still live on the same planet. 
I'm not saying everyone that disagrees with me are idiots and are paid to destroy Bitcoin. But you and many of your friends spew this crap all day. We have a disagreement and should find a proper way to go on. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:39:20
Yeah that would be bad news. It's nothing to worry about when a miner finds an empty block, I guess it probably usually happens right after the previous block was found so other miners will get both blocks within a short time. Do you have any info about that Luke? 
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:47:18
Please show proof of what you are claiming? 
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:56:40
You are making this up, how is he paying them to mine empty blocks? Is this your theory or do you have any solid proof? They are only empty if found right after another block right? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:56:47
Do you have any real proof of this? Because if you don't, you are just spreading misinformation. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:54:10
No he doesn't, that's not more true than Mr Maxwell or Mr Beck wanting it. Please stop the misinformation, it has gotten so extreme lately. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:57:31
Yeah. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:44:51
I've seen several posts stating that the blockchain.info mixer was not working? 
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:19:45
They are very open and I see this case in a very different way. These unsubstantiated claims are not needed, it only continues to divide us. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:16:28
That doesn't really address my question though, do you have any proof of the 100s of reddit accounts by people paid by Roger Ver? 
I agree some of his actions have been bad ideas, like the tweet thing. But many people support increasing the max block size, Mr Ver isn't their leader. 
But I'm sure you'll ignore this and lump everyone that wants a real max block size increase together as paid actors. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 23:33:11
Well he's not talking about moderators removing spam. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:33:52
Yes what we need is a way to work this out as adults. I appreciate your efforts to calm the situation. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:16:11
Good luck, and be careful. Throughout the years I have invested in some alt coins and increased my holdings to almost 100 btc the summer of 14. But as time went by and I made several bad investments as well as the coins I already had started falling. 
So now I have about 4 btc left. It hurts but I just wanted to warn you! 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:50:39
Amen. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:20:19
Lol, okay. Thank you for your insight. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:28:19
Not like anything like that has ever happened with Core (or qt), no way! Right?
@_date: 2017-03-02 10:54:45
You are making the situation worse by acting the way you do. The age of his account does not invalidate what he is saying. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:53:08
There was never not a human element. Come on, you don't make any sense and I'm sure you see it yourself. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:57:01
So these "attacks" you're talking about include publicly backing another implementation than Core and running another subreddit. Yeah, horrible horrible stuff. Nothing he has done can compare to the damage done to the community by some Core devs, who have seemingly created this situation on purpose. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:50:11
Try reading and understanding how the mechanisms that incentivize the miners work. They wouldn't shoot themselves in the foot like this, they want bitcoin to grow and for there to be room for more transactions. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:20:56
Any proof of these claims? How would you measure fear like that? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:39:07


Yeah we have a little more time to figure this out, see? 
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:11:55
I'm not sure if you understand why they mine empty blocks. It's nothing to get angry over. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:21:10
You're assuming so much about myself and others, it's weird to experience. He is free to buy and sell what he wants, that doesn't invalidate the fact that many users see the network as close to broken by congestion. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:13:29
Sure, but the whole mining ecosystem is adapting to the value of the block reward and fees. It's how it was always ment to work. 
There has to be some fees, but they don't need to be as high as we've seen recently if we allow more transactions into blocks, with or without segwit. 
I agree with you on the recent BU fuck ups, several things need to change before it is ready to go. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:58:48
Nothing sinister about mining empty blocks right after another one was found, it's just what they are incentivized to do. 
I don't see attacks on Core as attacks on Bitcoin. 
You are using incredible amounts of energy on bashing Roger as the leader of the opposition. Let's try building bridges and repairing the community. We should be able to find a compromise that can be implemented. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:37:53
How can you imply that it will be Bitcoin after a very controversial UAHF and/or a POW change? 
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:13:13
Yeah it makes no sense. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 21:06:20
You *do* know there's a lot of different people visiting right? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:45:09
I'm sorry but this is ridiculous, they would never do this as it would kill all confidence in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:03:06
Some of it might be happening now, who knows where we would be if things were allowed to grow organically. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:24:46
What is your conclusion Sherlock? How many fake accounts do you count? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:42:04
Really? How can you say that? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:41:41
There's no premine. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:28:14
Hehe okay, it was nice talking to you. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 13:12:43
Yeah, this is so sad. Imagine all the businesses that have investigated into using the Bitcoin blockchain, but because of these artificial limitations they use their time on other ideas. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:32:51
Not sure who is downvoting you, this is correct. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 09:55:17
Lol 
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:10:51
Not the smartest thing I've read today. Any more attacks on users with a different view than you? 
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:03:17
So the only options we have is to either keep the 1 MB limit, and make due with 220 million tx per year, or increase the max size to 1.6 GB allowing 1 billion tx per day? 
@_date: 2016-06-02 16:40:26

@_date: 2016-06-14 20:28:18
...yeah okay. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:37:05
Yep. Some seem to think that is the way it should be, and others would like for there to be more space in the blocks for more transactions. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 23:36:06
So we might as well stay here..?
@_date: 2016-06-04 09:50:15
Yep!

Two of those are mine, sorry.  
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:24:08
No, I don't work for Ver. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:59:35
Yeah, renaming is bad, glad we all agree. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 23:37:04
Not to you, but for a lot others. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:11:07
I guess to incentivize traders to do just that. Not sure what the exchanges get with this, other than being able to show off their high volumes. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:10:37
No but many users agree that this seems like the best option. 
Rogue redditors do not dictate Bitcoin, sorry. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:19:45
Maybe a few users are spamming, there has been behavior like this for a long time. But are you saying this explains all or most of the increased number of transactions? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:39:53
Nine yesterday and three today. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 23:50:34
Yeah, or some sort of flexible limit. I'm not in favor of any implementations, not sure if the best option exists yet. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:41:16
The Core devs have plans for some scaling, but quite small compared to what many believe should be done. I fear this will slow down/stop adoption and funnel users into other coins that can properly scale. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:04:27
Lol, you need to back off. I'm not sure if you're serious but thats such a foolish statement. 
@_date: 2016-11-10 17:01:39
I agree. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:02:34


Yep, myself and a family member have both had trouble with them earlier.

I can't find anything with that txid, can you double check it? 
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:57:20
Not really feeling it after all those low blows from Mr Mow. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 23:40:34
It's not in their interest to increase the 21 million cap, as belief in the system would fail. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:22:08
You are not making sense, how is implying that silly? Of course there are many things running the price discovery process. But I can't understand how you can argue against more users = higher price. 
I see you have said something like "Adding one more user does not make the price grow exponentially", thats not what anyone is saying. A lot of new users would probably increase the price substantially. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 18:26:26
No, what you are saying is wrong. You are trying to redefine the whole idea of Bitcoin, this is crazy. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:30:03
You don't know what your talking about, reading your comments I see you have clearly misunderstood something. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:12:20
A very smart investment anyways, I love my trezor. The weight off my shoulders can not even compare to the price, and if you buy any more you can just not have to worry. It feels so good compared to the uncertainty. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 10:14:47
Wow, you really seem to have it figured out. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 20:33:32
Incredibly helpful to have an oracle like yourself visit this forum and spread your absolute truth. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 19:30:18
Wow. Because the people and businesses of the world would have any need for that with a tiny max block size? 
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:03:24
1NSmSoDDCnDU8kwyEa32zrXwAobMAtKtDJ I hope you don't have to pay me! 
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:22:36
I still can't find any transaction. Maybe you can remove the extension completely and restore it? And If it's not there make a new transaction. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:04:09
...what the hell is this? Are you serious? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:43:00
It would. Hilarious!
@_date: 2016-11-01 09:17:27
I'd like to return your kind words right back to you. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:46:10
Trump will do some dumb shit. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:26:05
You were talking about adding *one* user. 
The quote you paste in every other comment has been mended on the blog, so the fact that you continue using it shows me you are not acting in good faith. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:06:33
If adding users to the community = more users buying bitcoin, would that not possibly raise the price? 
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:28:07
Do you understand how ridiculous your comment makes you look? Implying that everyone that disagrees with you are being paid, it's such a cheap shot. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:39:22
If 1% use it they will still save a lot of money in fees and charge backs. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 21:52:35
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:17:56
It might be, I didn't write it and I'm no professor. I still believe if we let Bitcoin run the way it always has up until a while ago, allowing more users and increasing the use cases, the price will most likely follow, increasing the compensation to the miners. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 16:35:50
How is it misinformation? 
Edit: You might mean that we don't know the reason for the suspension. That's true, but as he said it might be because of him mentioning someone by name. I'm not sure if what he did there is enough for a suspension though, we'll probably know more soon. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 22:56:15
Great analogy. I think he just pretends not to get it. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 16:32:58
@_date: 2016-11-24 17:00:58
Hero worship?
Roger Ver has an opinion. Some people agree with him, some don't. Sure, some praise/thank him on reddit or twitter, but this happens to Core devs as well. 
He was called bitcoin Jesus a long time before this whole community split. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 19:19:37
@_date: 2016-12-05 18:28:49

Finally you understand. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 00:32:59
Pretty much nothing from you makes much sense to me. But I guess we won't agree today who's the doofus. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 21:41:21
Don't mind if I do. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 16:50:04
On since 2013, but that doesn't matter. I don't remember anything about death threats or anything like that. Who were threatened and what happened to the bad guys? 
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:09:22


That doesn't sound very secure, won't there be bots running known words and phrases like on other brain wallets? 
Also, you should write down a howto in your will. You could die tomorrow. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:38:30
Oh don't follow my lead there =P I have it at home, the same place as the backup card. I'm ashamed, and I need to find a new place for the backup!
@_date: 2016-11-24 20:55:12
That happening does seem like the most probable scenario here, honestly. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:05:06
We've all been there.

It really is crazy that these people are wasting this huge opportunity by screwing it this much up. Why don't they do anything about all these bugs?

Why do you oppose an increased blocksize? 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:56:02
This is obviously not him. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:28:35
The fact that they are even hiding their massive censoring is crazy. I don't like that, but they don't care. Lets hope things get back to normal after a while.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:49:55
@_date: 2015-08-08 19:05:57
They're just exaggirating the current situation. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:47:14
Yeah, a whole bunch of transactions for 0.00001 BTC with a  0.0002 fee. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 21:05:12
I totally agree, it's well worth the cost knowing your coins are safe. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:35:39
Same mods as here. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:48:37
Good luck, I hope things go as well as planned! :)
I remember you talking about building some sort of app for sharing wifi with other bitcoin-users. What happened to that?
@_date: 2015-07-27 09:57:47
It seems like you're not the only one experiencing trouble with them. Search this sub to see what others are doing. Good luck! 
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:04:48
Amen, I agree with Mike on this. 
It's so sad to see how some of the other devs have handled this issue, with FUD and pure crap. So many people I used to respect now make my stomach turn. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:32:15
It's pretty safe on any computer with a trezor. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:46:33
Do you know the outcome? Did they take his money? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:27:55
There will always be someone with a different opinion, you can never get "universal agreement." What are your thoughts on that? 
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:18:52
Good point. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:47:52
That's like, your opinion, man. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 10:45:30
Sorry but he is only being careful. It's very risky selling btc on eBay, many sellers get scammed. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:58:03
I believe ment helping the owners of this service? 
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:19:54

@_date: 2016-09-22 11:10:44
Do you mean bitcoin.com? They found a block a few days ago. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 18:16:06

@_date: 2017-09-17 20:06:56
..because many miners also support it? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:59:07
You make this into a huuge deal, it really isn't. Having millions and millions of nodes doesn't help the network in any meaningful way. Most regular users can and will trust the wallet providers node etc, no matter what you wish for. And that's fine. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:28:27
Is what he's doing against reddit TOS? Or any rules? I don't think so, his account is used not only for promoting his own stuff. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:07:17
What good will your node do when the chain you follow has no hashing power and no new blocks are made? 
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:45:22
Lol, really funny descriptions.
Almost makes me want to buy some - but I'd never eat it!
You should add more candy as well, with "sarcastic" descriptions. Nice work!

@_date: 2015-04-23 18:10:06
You might be on to something here...!!
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:20:37
Yeah, right now. But if we're hoping to get some adoption, that needs to change. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:13:19
What is that site, bitcoinlnsider? Not i but a small L. Phishing?

bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-10-16 19:37:58
Your refusal to debate people that doesn't "understand" that may be the reason you still have this view. Bitcoin is being changed now, completely. What I mean is Bitcoin is now being transformed to a settlement layer on top of what some others see as Bitcoin. It was never ment to be always congested and for fees to skyrocket. At least there never was any real talk of this back a few years ago. All of a sudden people guys like you treat guys like me like idiots for disagreeing. 
Anyway, I believe the default in case of controversy would be to keep it running like it always has. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:01:37
..really? My God. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 19:23:52
Very nice of you, but aren't you just acting like a bottleneck here? I'm no expert though, sorry if I'm wrong! 
@_date: 2016-10-07 21:20:15
My bad, thanks for the correction!

..or this. Done. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 21:09:41
Once more off-topic and once more, a upvote for you. Second in a long time.
I don't have any huge problems with segwit, but I'm for a maxblocksize increase. I would also like to see Core replaced with a new team, with some former Core developers as well. 
I see many posts hating on segwit without them having properly read about it first (I guess.) 
I like the tone of the two last replies of yours I've read, keep it up! ��
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:47:14
Seriously, you either need to stop commenting here or you need to at least try to understand what you are vomiting words about. You are annoying as hell, with no substance. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:34:59
No problem, the max block size will be increased shortly, I think Gavin is bumping it up to 20 mb. Later it can be increased again. No worries. 
@_date: 2015-10-26 23:26:23


- americanpegasus
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:05:08
Exactly what I got. Well, it's just 5 bucks. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 16:46:31
A small increase like to 2mb would be no problem for 98% of nodes etc. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:13:47
If we get near that limit it'll probably just be increased more. Don't worry about it, it'll be fixed before it's an issue. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:29:16
Lol this is such a weird statement, it's crazy to think that it matters. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 22:04:18

You have many strong opinions, but that doesn't mean you are correct. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:52:26
The other guy backed out. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 15:57:13
I very much agree with you, what is happening is no one will take any chances to build stuff for bitcoin now, they use other alternatives. How some people can't see all the possible huge adoption being stopped because of this. I'm very sad it has come to this. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 11:13:58
People call us crazy, but I agree. If bitcoin is left to thrive it will explode in popularity. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:58:57
I think he means your use of the word "wallets". 
@_date: 2016-05-15 20:23:46
Nothing does. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:05:09
No, people should stop whining about thinks already being fixed, if you have any real contributions they are more than welcome. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:00:23
Lol man, awesome video. You should edit the description to Bitcoin tips: 1...... 
Best of luck, I guess you'll get some busy days onwards :) 
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:01:58
Hmm. I have heard something like that before.. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:04:57
You should appreciate your small balls. Going all in is pretty risky. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:37:12
Where do you live?
The easiest is probably  I bought from them using my Visa debit card. You can also try  if you are from the states or  if you are from europe.
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:20:44
What happens if the miners fork and your node stays on a blockchain that never gets any new blocks? 
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:30:37
Obviously on the behalf of changetip.

@_date: 2015-03-13 20:22:13
"in their current spam" = all transactions from them or only a few? If it's only a few you need to buy a book on how to communicate better. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 20:47:17
My guess is a test trade back in July went through the API and cryptowatch saved it. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:26:50
Thanks, hadn't noticed! 
Oh? Please update me, that was the last I heard of it. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 10:37:20
You should be happy they are offering it back to you, many exchanges take your coins after x months of inactivity. 
Don't store coins on exchanges! 
@_date: 2015-02-06 15:34:50
No, it doesn't need gold, at least not any more. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 10:22:25
These attacks are simply some people taking the transactions and making a copy, changing just the txid. The txid is not hashed together with the rest of the transaction, so they can be changed and rebroadcasted. Nothing gets lost, it just creates difficulties for some nodes and wallets that use the txid as the identifier. 
A 51% attack is when 51% of miners start mining with other rules, so they can eg increase the block reward from 25 btc per block to whatever they want. 
Edit: okay, so scratch that last part.  Sorry. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:53:18
Yeah, I really appreciate his commitment to this subreddit. Of course, you do great work yourself, thank you as well.
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:14:35
It'll pretty definitely be converted to usd before you can play with them. But later you convert your winnings to btc and transfer them to your wallet. Still a huge deal if they do this. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:56:57
Damn, BashCo is doing a great job moderating this sub. I hope he continues this way, it'll be a huge loss if he gets tired of it.

We wouldn't increase capacity to match PayPal now, that wouldn't make any sense. 
And the fee is relatively cheap now, but this might just be getting started for all we know.

Haha he's so crazy, he might actually eat his dick if he loses. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:52:51
Yeah, you can just copy your new receive address and send to that at a later time.
I'm not sure about adding a passphrase after creating the wallet, I think that'll produce a different set of keys.
You can use it for many things, have one for "deep savings" or whatever.  I used it when a buddy of mine had to wipe his Trezor, so I was sure I sent him back his exact coins without mixing my history with his.

Do you really think a zillion people will run a computer 24/7 to earn tiny amounts of bitcoin? I really don't see this as a killer app, sorry. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 12:46:20
Nice work! I don't own an Xbox, but I like your idea :) 
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:10:02
That may be the way you see things, but that doesn't give you the authority to control how other people communicate. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:49:28
My guess is you messed up the seed in one way or the other. Did you set a pin in Hive? Try importing it again with variations of words you might have misspelled. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 11:29:16
It doesn't, the difficulty is adjusted so one block is found every ten minutes on average. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:58:41
I like the bitcoin twist on this. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:09:26
This is just crazy. Did they do this on purpose? 
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:17:19
Every sale where bitcoin is used is cheaper for the merchant. Almost no one uses bitcoin right now, things take time to grow. Jeez... 
@_date: 2017-07-12 23:14:15
The guy smiling is holding the sign. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 20:41:10
Many of your "concerns" are things that are already being worked on, and it most likely will be accepted by most miners, and things carry on. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:46:19
Block size will be increased over and over as bitcoin grows. No worries! 
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:35:22
Yeah at todays block reward, but it decreases quickly.. Give it 20-30 years! 
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:30:44
With the difficulty, finding a block on your own would take months or years. The blockchain will quickly die. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:36:59
Ah, in a hurry I just read the topic. Sorry OP! 
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:35:40
This is brand building for Bitpay, not a bitcoin ad.

I doubt that many people see him as a god. It's more that what we signed up for, what is written in the whitepaper, is being changed by a small group of people.

@_date: 2015-02-19 17:33:08

@_date: 2015-02-17 22:01:07
Sorry for your loss, I hope you get your coins back!

You yourself are a liar and a hijacker. At least from where I stand. Any comments on that? 
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:47:37
You seem to be the only one in this thread that thinks this is ok. You also throw around insults to those who disagree with you. It's not what the community needs, you are not helping anyone acting this way.
