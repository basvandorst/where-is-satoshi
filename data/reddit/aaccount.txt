I don't know why they are saying wikileaks and snowden verified it... Cisco disclosed the leaked 0 day exploits are legitimate this is no faked leak as they just had to release fixes:

My favorite bit of this:


Okay so at least he understands that prohibition doesn't work, and recognizes that it will still be used by people legal or not.  So he is fine with it being used for darknet purchases, but wants to deny the law abiding world the advantages of bitcoin.

Coinbase offers recurring payments.

The majority of that transaction volume for BTC is simply changing between users own addresses or changing between gamblers over and over again.  So you would really need to see some stats related to how many commerce transactions are taking place i.e. how many transactions are Bitpay and Coinbase processing for merchants I'm sure it's much less than $2.7B.

Not all that ridiculous if Jared DerYeghiayan actually does have the purported evidence.  Although unlikely it could explain where the Bitcoin to purchase Silk Road from Ulbricht came from.

I have NEFCU  (New England Federal Credit Union), and they charge me $6.50/mo.  The charge says it's for my bill pay that I use, but that sounds more than fair of a monthly fee for my checking account w/interest &amp; online bill pay.  There has to be compensation for a banks overhead costs somewhere, and credit unions are definitely still the way to go even if you pay $5/mo to not get raped by other bank fees.

Ha when I read the headline "ATMs being rolled in Australia for online currency Bitcoin."  I was thinking to myself some stupid robbers didn't know the machine doesn't have actual coins in it.    Headline should be "ATMs being rolled out in Australia..."

I'm not saying you're wrong, but people die in high-profile cases all the time.  See JFK Assassination for starters:
I know one instance doesn't make my point, but if you're under the delusion nothing in high-profile cases ever goes wrong you're either an idiot or troll.  Either way grow up and read book sometime.

Was SegWit in v0.13.0, but not set to signal until v0.13.1? I'd expect a change like SegWit to come from a v0.14.0 not a *.1 patch release. Does Bitcoin core use semantic versioning?
@_date: 2015-03-07 01:57:48
Clearly you missed the point that you don't know what USD is actually worth.  Because having 5000 or 10000 shares of a mystery total issuance is difficult to value it feels good to value something where you know there will only ever be 21 million total shares issued in bitcoin.

Leahy most certainly does have MPAA ties.  He is always siding with them in all manner of disputes.  He even gets screen time in blockbuster movies such as Batman:
As a Vermonter I'm sorry this idiot has any power, but what are you going to do when incumbents always win.  Anytime I point out how terrible Leahy is as a representative for VT I'm told "no he's great because he has seniority and is able to bring pork barrel spending to VT"...  Even by conservatives...

Even after receiving a $1 Million order they still need to take pre-orders?  They are a joke, but more importantly a scam...  Finally received my shipping notice today for an order placed 7 months ago...  If they aren't front running the market by mining until it's not worth it for them anymore I don't know how to explain their incompetence.

In this case the merchant is already on board.  He's marketing to the consumers with a great discount.  If it proves to be ineffective at marketing than he can always change the special to a reasonable rate for himself as well later.

2% isn't that enticing especially for someone who has never used bitcoin before and sees no point in setting up an account.  Offering 5% + I think breaks a psychological barrier in finding it worth your time to actually setup a coinbase account for the discount.

Glad you pointed this out.  It was exactly the same key point I saw in this video that I was going to mention.  Very interesting to see Bernanke's public acceptance of it over Gold as you know he was not being fully honest about the reasoning behind that belief.
