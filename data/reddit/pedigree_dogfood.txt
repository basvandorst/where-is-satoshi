Mintpal was bought by Moolah IO awhile back, after mintpal was hacked and funds were stolen. Moolah CEO is Alex Green, who apparently has scammed people before.

I just sent you guys an email! Hopefully this works out well :)

Thanks for the reply. I'll probably sell my Target gift card to you if you are offering 80%, that sounds much better than I imagined.
edit: Received the bitcoin! Thank you! Very fast, would recommend.

I usually don't keep coins on trading sites, I had trades processing late at night so I went to bed and when I woke up the following morning, the site was down and all this had happened.

Actually sold some Amazon gift cards there, Im in the process of selling my target giftcard.

Thanks for the info. I'll look into getting a prepaid visa.

That's a shame...
Do either of these tweets mean anything for us?
Or is all hope lost?
Edit: Apparently the Moolah CEO is a well known scammer and mintpal's credit union account was recently closed. They also seem to be blocking withdrawals. I'd say we were fucked over. Oh well, hopefully they get buttfucked in court or at least in hell.

Thanks for the suggestion, I actually just made my first transaction on there just minutes ago, and was in the process of making the trade when you posted that. I was afraid of scammers, but it seems like a really nice subreddit as long as you're careful.
