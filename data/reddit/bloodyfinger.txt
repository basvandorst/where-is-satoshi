So what exactly is it good for at this point except hoping that you can sell it for more than you paid?
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:52:05
Honestly, as people who want to promote bitcoin adoption, you should try to come off as more serious. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 03:24:41
This is actually good for bitcoin.

Wow, as someone who was seriously considering adopting bitcoin I've got to say that seeing the maturity level of people in this thread is seriously off-putting. There's fundamental differences between a knowledge repository and a digital currency. Seriously, you guys give off an uneducated, self-righteous, and holier than thou vibe in this thread. It's pretty cringey. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:13:35
I'm saying this with all honesty: you need a mental health checkup. You sound absolutely delusional.

So I should start using bitcoin because some people want to do away with banks? I'm not exactly following your logic of how this benefits me? I like using a bank. I think it really helps me organize my finances. Paying with a credit card is easy and provides great security to me. How does converting my money to bitcoin provide me any benefit? Please, I'm really curious. 
Also, whether or not I can pay for things in bitcoin, the actual price of these things is are still priced in real world dollars. That makes the prospect of converting my money to bitcoin. For example, if I had converted my money several months ago when bitcoin was at $1000 and people here were absolutely raving about it, I would be in big trouble right now. I would have lost ~90% of my buying power. That seems like a *huge* red flag for me when considering bitcoin, and it isn't really offset by the benefit of "some people want to not have a bank account one day".

What (if ever) *will* be the advantages? I'm very curious about this?
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:18:33


You make some good points, but this part I find very hard to believe.
Anyways, thanks for taking the time to respond. You actually do raise a lot of really interesting points. Cheers!

Question: What is the benefit of converting my money to bitcoin so I can pay for things with Uber? What problem is bitcoin actually solving for me, an individual, on a legal purchase? I regularly use Uber and pay for it with my credit card. I just can't see how bitcoin is making this better/easier/safer.

I'm pretty shocked to see a comment like this actually in the positive upvoted territory on this subreddit. I guess the recent crash got rid of a lot of the delusional idiots. Comparing the volatility of bitcoin to an actual (stable) government backed currency is a fool errand.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:09:30
I kind of want to just go back through all the old threads, all the old PMs, all the history, just to find all the delusional fucking idiots who were claiming "Bitcoin at $10,000 by xmas 2014!!" and espousing it as the second coming of Christ... just to rub it in their smug fucking faces. Oh god, this is just such buttery popcorn. I'm loving all of this.
Ahhhh fuck it... who am I kidding? This is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:44:24


This could just be the stupidest fucking thing I've read it the past few hours. You are delusional. Get help. Bitcoin will never be at "tens of thousands of dollars".
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:36:43
Well right now processing fees can usually be negotiated for about 1-1.5% of the total transaction. If I pay with my VISA, I already get 1.5% back in rewards, I have a ton of other benefits too like being fully insured, and security features. Even *if* they do lower their fees (which I doubt they would do), I still don't think I would want to switch from using my credit card. I'm really not worried about my credit card info being stored also, since once again it is fully insured.
From what I've seen with bitcoin is that this is actually a huge *disadvantage* compared to credit cards. Look at what happened with Mt Gox. People lost a lot of money without any insurance whatsoever. I really don't see how what you listed are benefits to me (again, I'm just being honest, this isn't an attack).
What are the potential benefits of programmable money? What does that mean exactly?
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:03:37
Just out of curiosity.... do you see bitcoin as *just* an investment? What I mean is... are you buying this for any reason other than to just sell it off when the price increases?
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:10:17


Nah, I'm actually pretty happy thanks!


I have an excellent relationship with my mom! :)


It will most certainly *not* be $10,000+ some day.


Well you got the first part right, it won't happen overnight. Or over two nights, or three.... over ever. How do you know I have an ugly face by the way? I think *you* have an ugly face!


Nah, this isn't really like that.


Oh god no, not at all!!! I have an amazing wonderful life! I don't need to pray for other's failure to make me more satisfied... but in case it was just wonderful.


Well *obviously*! This *is* good for bitcoin. I already said that.


If "ifs" and "buts" were candy and nuts, we'd all have a merry Christmas. If my aunt had a dick she'd be my uncle.


This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:14:42
Honestly, thanks a lot for taking the time to respond where others would have just been childish and argued.


This actually seems really interesting. I'm going to read more about this.


This is why it's valuable to have people take that leap into bitcoin and test things out. Tinker, see what works and what needs to be built. The more people taking this leap, the more success bitcoin companies will see and can expand.
You are actually winning me over. There are definitely down sides but overall it's starting to look a lot more interesting. Seriously, thanks again for taking the time to write all that out. It's definitely in its infancy and with it's ridiculous growth in the past year there would obviously be some growing pains..... but now that you've explained more of the positives, I'm feeling much less negative about it than before.
Cheers :)

You said a lot without really saying anything. What exactly is the *benefit* to for to actually adopt this? I completely understand that it is a "paradigm shift" and "an entire new ecosystem" in some ways.... but I'm not exactly sure why it is better than the system I am currently using? It is definitely not obvious to me. I hope you don't take this as an attack, I'm actually very curious to hear your (or anyone else's) thoughts on this.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:12:29
Doesn't it worry you that if you had heavily bought into bitcoin a few months ago, your buying power with Uber would have been cut by over 80% since Uber prices their rides in your local currency?
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:12:04
You. Are. Delusional.
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:36:19
Yeah no kidding what a stupid fucking statement. The USD is backed by the **United fucking States Government**. Arguably more stable than oil. People in this sub fundamentally misunderstand economics and moreso what makes currency actual currency. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:58:06
BTC would be *pointless without gains and losses*?!??! I'm sorry, but that may actually be the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Don't you *want* stability? I mean, either it is a currency or a store of value. Both those things need stability. If it's not stable then it's just basically gambling on a Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:42:42
Shhhh you'll ruin the circlejerk.

No, but that chart was clearly posted to make is "seem" like Bitcoin has steadily increased in value and isn't trending back down toward zero. It's a "feel good" chart.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:46:57
Fuck, me too. Should we start a subreddit? 
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:53:16
This chart is literally just so people can feel better. Stop lying to yourself.
