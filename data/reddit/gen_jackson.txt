Ah thanks a ton!

Did you make passphrase.io? 
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:37:01
LOL. 
Nice. 
Bitcoin for the win, bros.

Are you retarded? Do you know what communism/socialism brought to this world?
Take a look @ communist china,  the USSR, Germany, even the U.S.A.
Hell, I can't own a freakin lemonade stand without being called out for not having a food licences.  I can't sell my own food. I can't sell raw milk. I can't get a bank account - all because of this crappy socialist mindset and you say 


To say this is to show your **absolute** ignorance. You have, obviously, no experience with the real world. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:15:11
Jw, why are you doing this?

so much money

How exactly can he play the market??
(This is a legit question, not just some smart-ass troll - I am fairly new to BTC and am inquiring about someones ability to manipulate the market just by sending 1000 bitcoin)
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:41:05
I have, but I find that the amount of times I will find a nice fitted jacket for a good price is very rare and its not worth getting the CRAPPY, CRAPPY jackets I find there.. Absolutely CRAPPY
Lol, BFX.... *SIGH*  
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:57:24
Hopefully something good, no? 
I think the rise is a good size after the BFX hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 18:52:56
Maybe. 
Thanks tho. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 13:51:28
Look - I know in the future, 10+ years from now, bitcoin will be worth millions. [I was just asking for a prediction for 2016]. But other **idiots** want to hold on to the stock market because they believe that this communist society we have been oppressed by will work forever. **Sigh** - *Globalists...* and even capitalists for that matter. 
So, basically my point is that people don't look ahead into the future because they are ignorant. 
[Fiatleak]( is a cool website were you can see, live, the amount of bitcoin being sold. It is bizarre. And China? China... China is buying bitcoin
 &gt; with every *yuan* the can borrow 
@_date: 2016-08-24 18:18:49
Thanks for the feedback!!
I am very excited!~!
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:13:53
Lol, when you post your address, but know that hundreds of other people will also and if this is legit (which i doubt, but what the heck), your chances of actually winning 10 bitcoins (which at age 15 with 0.5 btc, you are hoping to God this is legit and you win) are very slim.... just looked at how many BTC actually will be donated.... 1000 BTC.. WOW.
Now I really hope this is legit...
What the heck... anything free is worth saving up for!!
Looking back at the ledger for this address, it's crazy to see how many inputs/outputs have been generated by this address!
Bro, if you are reading this, at least send me 1... I need suits from Mens Warehouse.. ;)
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:46:14
I'd rather it rise than go down, duh. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:20:55
DO ANOTHER!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:47:16
But wouldn't this make the price of bitcoin go down?
Because it would be a private party giving 1MM Bitcoins thus no one is really 'purchasing' (as if from an exchange) - but then again, I really don't understand Bitcoin in terms of price.
Would you mind explaining??
So, scarcity makes something more valuable (assuming multiple parties want that certain 'something'). But, the BFX hackers didn't make new btc so why did the price drop?
I don't understand the term 'into the market', I guess. Because to me it appears as if 'into the market' would mean that more btc were created (i.e. by mining) so when the price dropped $100, after the BFX hack, I didn't really understand (and still don't). 
I understand that 'volatile times produce volatile prices' - but how?
@_date: 2016-08-26 01:40:00
Thanks for you feedback!!
@_date: 2016-08-31 22:29:00
Thanks, I will check that out! 
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:33:39
You really think all of the rest will leave the EU??
I didnt think that faar. 
HODL ALL THE SATOSHIS!!!!!!
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:33:12
Yeah, how I wish I knew of Bitcoin and its potential when it was 1.27/BTC!!!
See you in 10 years when we are the top 90% of the rich folk ;) 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:08:31
like 79 dollars worth. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:02:50
lol - yes; more from my father tho. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:08:09
Ah, thanks for the advice. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:03:52
I dont see how you can hold a position of big government and fiat money?? 
That is what I mean by 'world economy' - all the fiat currency - not something hard like gold, silver, bitcoin, etc. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:05:46
Yeah, I was just expecting it to rise, not drop - But, I can see the volatility of it at this stage. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:43:50
So you would hold to the view that the world economy is not going to fall? 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:06:12
Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:05:13
This is the most liberal thing I have read in 5 minutes. 
Better go check drudgereport.com to see if I can find something more liberal. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:07:17
Thanks for the advice and I definitely will! 
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:30:07
Thanks, man!!
And I will hold those 'Satoshis'
Edit: Hodl those Satoshis
Just found out what hodl means... :) 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:06:48
I know, but in the context of all that I have said and the current events, I expected it to rise. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:29:05
yeah, yeah. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:51:07
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:50:58
Lol, agreed!
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:35:14
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:14:46
True - 
But when the USD is worth nothing, what will bitcoin be worth?
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:42:09
True - Can you up your fee through blockchain.info or must you use some other wallet? 
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:51:09
okay - great thanks for the clarification!!
@_date: 2016-10-27 13:38:03
Great stuff!!!
Thanks for the insightful post, man!
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:07:15
ffs. 
why didnt anyone tell me this was going on? 
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:50:21
Ya' gotta' love the free market!
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:02:19
that is the thing, fiat currency really has no real value. It's just paper with numbers on it. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:45:27
What do you mean by 'doesn't seem to care'?
Do you mean it's a common problem, so there is no need to freak out about it?
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:50:34
No problem!!
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:38:06
Great insightful information!
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:50:51
Thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:44:37
So basically it's a matter of how urgent your transaction is.
If you have an urgent transaction, you could up your tx fee and get the transaction through faster; but, e.g.,  if you are just sending money to a cold wallet you wouldn't mind the wait.
Am I correct or at least thinking down the right track? 
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:34:50
I was using the 'proper business' way of abbreviating thousand.
46MM* would be crazy - maybe even slow the system? 
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:17:43
So basically it's a tactic used to lower bitcoin prices so that me, as the short position, will be able to buy more for a lower price??
What, by the way, is 'shorts' and 'short position'?
Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:51:37
Nah. 
A Lamborghini.
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:51:29
This is deep.
P.S. Thanks - this really did help!
