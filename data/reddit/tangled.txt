That's a really bad video for what you're trying to achieve; unless someone is already embedded in the semiotics of both bitcoin and Apple, it's completely meaningless - and, even then, it's fairly crude. As a nerdy bitcoin fanboy promo it's fine, but as a protest video it's way off the mark. No one who doesn't already understand this issue is going to understand the video, and it just comes off as a swivel-eyed rant referencing lots of geek stuff.

Each time I click the "pledge" button it goes up by two or three counts. Which is surprising, particularly when you note that if you leave it for ten seconds and then click again, it goes up by between 12 and 14 places.
Given it's not obvious how you navigate the site at first, or what you are pledging, that suggests that you're getting HUGE traffic. Truly huge traffic. Like well over 5000 people an hour (because, after all, not everyone is going to pledge).
In fact, I see that someone further down said it hit 24,000 3 hours ago - and it's now at 39,000.
Also - you say "a few months ago" but the domain was only registered on March 21st.
So - I have to ask... Is this just bullshit? 
Are you running Google Analytics on the site?
Edit: there are 117,981 readers of - and it tells me that there are "482 users here now". So I'm sorry, but this is definitely either fake or there is something badly flawed in your site. Even if every single reader of visited your site and clicked pledge multiple times that would not account for the huge number of "pledges" you're claiming. Given that the pledges are completely meaningless, it's nothing but a vanity metric.

I don't understand, no. Please explain?

haha! thanks for the tip :)
By plunge I just meant that it's just hassle to find a straight-forward way to trade ££ for bitcoin. I've looked into LocalBitcoins and that looks like the easiest way in the UK.

The button is bullshit, and that makes the message completely bullshit. It's a vanity project, and nothing more.

Oh, right - when I was reading mtGox stopped withdrawals, I assumed that meant you couldn't get dollars out, not you couldn't get bitcoin out either. Wow. 
But yes, cautionary lesson for everyone there then - don't leave your bitcoin sitting in someone else's wallet. 
Was there any advantage to people leaving bitcoin in mtGox rather than withrdrawing to their own wallets, or was it just laziness/convenience/(misplaced) trust?

Or one of the crashes is so fundamental that it never recovers.

Ah, sorry, I thought he meant send bitcoin to someone and then they actually physically go to a shop and buy something, then send it to him. 
But yeah, it seems to me that the whole "lets use fiat because it shows we hate the establishment" is one of the massively douchey image problems that bitcoin needs to counter before it gets anywhere near mainstream.

That's not true though. If people lose faith in a particular currency as a means of exchange, then they will accept it, but only if they know that they can turn it into their preferred currency easily and at a stable rate. So long as bitcoin fluctuates wildly, it's not stable enough for people to use, and the more it crashes, the less willing people become to hold it for any length of time, unless there are enough goods available for purchase with bitcoin that it doesn't matter but so long as it fluctuates wildly you cannot, for example, sell basic commodities in exchange for bitcoin, because it becomes too complex to manage the market. It's a vicious circle.

Problem is, it's not about how low it goes - it's whether people lose confidence in it as a medium of exchange. Which, to be honest, at the moment, it hasn't got. The media attention just now that is resulting in spikes is not because people see it as a viable currency, but because speculators are rushing in and hoping to make money - for those people it's just another financial instrument that people are betting on in the hope of making a quick buck, and has no value in itself.

This money was stolen from me when I, at my own volition, sent a bank transfer with a reference attached to it.

See above: I thought that the OP meant "I will send bitcoin to you, you will go to a shop and purchase goods for me, then mail them to me". I didn't realise that he was talking about internet-shopping-by-proxy.

It's nice that you're an optimist. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 11:48:08
Not an answer to your question, and I'm not trying to be a dick here, but why do bitcoin people always say "fiat" rather than "cash"?
