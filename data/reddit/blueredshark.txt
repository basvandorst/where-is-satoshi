"never came back" its been like 1 month+ since that... relax baby booo.
Every move up has had its correction, his buying at 19000+ is probably the one of the stronger FOMO cases i´ve ever seen in my trading career

Cryptos have been out for years, the only exciting thing about them is the %Gain, thats all it is to it.
90+% of the people investing could not give a rats ass about "crypto" saving the world
Inflation and wage inrease goes hand in hand, 95% of people spend 90% of their total net income they earned the same year.. thus making inflation not relevant.
For a crypto to survive, and to be normalized as a currency it needs one thing and one thing only : price stability.. but with price stability the excitement dies off.
Cryptos are a fad.
Im perfectly fine buying and earning money in todays currency, if i save money (inflation) i as any other normal person invests it, or puts it in a savings fund.. where you beat inflation and gain % extra on top of it.
Most of the investors in crypto are 20-30 year olds, beard growing know it all!

Wow insanely cringe worthy thread.. that and the 82% up vote..
You do know that every time BTC made a huge move, it had a correction of -60/70% from the ATH..
Why the hell did you buy at 19,000... did you really think it was going to 100,000 without you.. FOMO level: Stupid.
