Bitcoin is a currency. Bitcoin surpassing Western Union isn't comparable at all. It would only be meaningful if you said 'Bitcoin surpasses US Dollar in daily transaction volume'.
What this is essentially saying is, US dollars surpassed Western Union in daily transaction volume.
Well no shit.
edit: I'm an idiot. Should have clicked the link. Leaving my stupidity up and owning it.

In order to regulate wall street you have to have worked on wall street and understand it. Are you saying an otherwise qualified person shouldn't get a job bc his personal political opinions differ from yours?

Ok, that makes a lot of sense. Didn't think about it that way, but it makes sense. Thanks. I do still find that that would be difficult for the population at large to accept, hard for them (me included) to relate to.
It seems like that would stand in the way of large scale acceptance.

Right, but most people don't by Berkshire Hathaway. Either they are educated investors or they have shares through a mutual fund.
If Bitcoin were to stay a currency on a smaller scale, for more technologically educated investors, it would be one thing. But I hear a lot about how people want bitcoin to go mainstream. I don't think the average person would understand why the value is so much higher than what they're used to.

Not an economic reason, more a psychological one, but your comment isn't entirely off base. I am not a professional, but as a layman, it seems to me that the larger population would find it difficult to understand and/or accept a currency that is valued so much higher than the one they currently use.


As far as pricing/market value goes, you're probably right. But as far as wide acceptance, it seems to me like it would be the more important factor. It's difficult for normal people to relate to. 
Kind of like when they say the US puts a million dollar reward on the capture of important terrorists, but no one turns them in bc they don't understand how a million dollars could possibly relate to their lives. It's like a made up value. 
This is how I feel the general public would feel towards a currency valued so much higher than their own.

It was pretty clear selling drugs online was illegal. And knowingly providing financial services for a site that sells drugs is also illegal. I don't think anything was unclear.
edit: which is why he admitted it and plead guilty

Why would a link to an AMA use NP? Aren't you supposed to participate? It's not exactly brigading.
