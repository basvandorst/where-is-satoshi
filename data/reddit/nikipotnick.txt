I think there is a difference between what range it can be stable at versus what price point it could touch on a given day - maybe on a crazy day it could reach a million but I think a more reasonable estimate is up to 200K (so, a bit over 10X of what it is now). Don't get me wrong , I'd love it to hit a million, but we have to think about what is a stable price point - at 200k it is maybe 40% of the gold market - that is not too shabby - maybe, maybe it could (over say 20 years) hit a 500K stable range to be on par with gold, but having a hard time thinking it could be worth a million (so, about 2 times gold market cap) for any kind of stable length of time.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:50:41
Well if we get into the 500K - Million range I'll sell and put the winnings into a sensible, well balanced and diversified portfolio. No sense getting too greedy - take a good profit and convert into something can be well diversified and maintain for the long run - that is how to create generational wealth - take your winnings and spread it around into multiple instruments / sectors (so, bonds, stocks in different verticals, etc.). Anyone can win the lottery. It takes some thought to preserve those winnings. So, once I feel like I've made a nice little bundle (and holding at least a year to qualify for capital gains instead of  income taxes to get some savings there) then I'll sell. But not for a while yet. HODL. :-)

You could argue this is an urban legend. There is ZERO proof this ever happened. There is also ZERO proof "satoshi" is a real person. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:40:00
I don't like this Messianic crap. You'd think Satoshi was the second coming of [fill in the blank your favorite higher power]. "Satoshi" is most likely a pen name for a group of developers who in turn were most likely hired by some state actor or other (possibly Japan, maybe even the U.S. itself). Give it a rest with "Satoshi" as Keanu Reeves from the Matrix. Grow up.

blockchain is here to stay - bitcoin was / is an early experiment in blockchain so it is good store of value, collectors item type of thing, even if other crypto's replace it like for example litecoin or monero - bitcoin is kind of a digital gold or digital baseball card, for having been the first experiment with blockchain which will revolutionize b2b interactions - won't be as obvious to the person on the street but it will still be big (ripple for example already disrupting b2b money flow).

@_date: 2017-12-11 09:56:28
I am more optimistic on TA than this article - I think if you combine 2 or more indicators together that is safer than using only 1. So instead of for example trading based on RSI, try combining it with say Stochastic. But I also agree long term hodl strategy also works so you could always take some of your money and trade with it (based on combo of TA indicators) and take the bulk of the money and spread it around in a long term well diversified hodl type way.

I agree. Just put some money that you can afford to lose in, and then don't worry about it for a  year, and then come back and see where your investment is. Also for goodness sakes diversify - buy a nice well balanced index tracking ETF that is across several sectors (they are  many out there, just search around). That should be 95% of your portfolio and only should have 5% in crypto, tops.

Not an academic here but just my gut - I think BTC will continue to "moon" upwards possibly rivalling the market cap of gold, then it will correct back down, and find a stable range to settle it and possibly move up again albeit more slowly - rough guess - maybe it gets to say half a million or even a million then falls back to maybe 100K and finds a stabilization around there and then creeps back up but more slowly - amazon did similar - it mooned in the late 90's, crashed down, then crept back up again but more slowly. If we see a 500K - million per coin, I'd sell because it would almost certainly find a lower, more stable point after that - again not an academic, just an opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:10:48
This is why you need to diversify always. I tell people to buy lots of stuff - bonds, stocks, even collectible art - crypto is just one thing out of many to invest in. Bitcoin I think has very good possibility and I am long on it, but it has risks. As you say what if for example whoever the people are behind the "Satoshi" pen name decide to dump their 1 million coins? That is the end of the tulip bubble right there. So buying bitcoin you are in effect betting that such an event won't happen in the near future. So while bitcoin has promise as a new standard of reserve like say silver or palladium, it has big risk, namely this very issue of "whales" deciding to cash out. Diversify and make risk your friend not your adversary. ;)

Thanks for your post. I have a not too dissimilar tale myself - I didn't actually get into BTC until recently after having been sober for over a year. However I always liked investing and cannot help but think I may have gotten into BTC in 2013 or 2014 had I not spent those years in a drinking stupor basically. Like you, I am now sober and working, and putting what I can into Bitcoin. I think that is about all I can do right now. (I also have some diversification into other investments like money market etc.) Coulda/Shoulda/Woulda does not help anyone. I feel it myself but all I can do is maximize opportunity TODAY. That's all I have. Good luck (to both of us). :-)
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:02:45
Think of it this way - if 1 BTC gets to a million USD then 1 Satoshi will equal 1 penny ($0.01). Then things could be well priced in Satoshis - cup of McD's coffee - 99 Satoshi. Cup of Starbucks latte - 300 Satoshi. Etc. It could be the new normal. Personally I think BTC is more store of value than real life currency but you never know what could happen.

First of all I think "Satoshi" is a group - the code is too complex for one person - it would be like 1 scientist making the atom bomb - you need a team for that type of effort. Second I think the US government knows who these people are, and I also think a state actor was / is behind the whole thing - maybe Japan, but in any case the US government knows who these folks are. Also, why would we want to track them down? So long as they are not a threat to national security we should leave them alone. They would be a target for criminals wanting to steal their million bitcoins if their identities were known. Leave them alone and trust the government is on top of it. I am not worried. Just let them be.

Bitcoin has value as I have said many times as being the first mover in the Blockchain era - other coins are more speculative but Bitcoin is a store of value.

I have said many times and will say it now. "Satoshi" is a pen name for a group of at least 4 devs most likely hired by a state actor of however many participants to develop bitcoin. The NSA knows the identities of all of them. It is much too complex a project for only 1 developer. I do have a concern that these devs may dump their coins on the market one day in what will be perhaps the greatest pump and dump scam in the history of the human race.

@_date: 2017-12-17 17:35:24
I think it opens later tonight tho not certain. I think if futures are positive it will be self-fulfilling prophecy for Bitcoin price - that is, say if lots of people are buying futures to say that the price will hit 25K a month from now, then that positive sign will drag the current underlying price across the 20K mark - yes there is a wall right now but if the futures open bullish that will impact positively on the underlying asset.

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:26:39
Yeah at this rate it could easily get down to 10K. After the flash crash I hoped a bottom would be established around 17K. That did not happen. It continues to fall. I think we are starting to see a shift away from Bitcoin and into alternatives such as BCash or Bitcoin Gold. We may never see 18K again at this rate. You are a FOOL if you are buying Bitcoin now. I have some and I guess I will hang onto it because I do not like selling at a loss. But I sure as fuck ain't buying no more.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:17:39
Just use technical indicators (Stochastic, RSI, etc.) to see if Bitcoin is over bought, then take a (small) short position, then after it goes down a bit, get out of the position and take your profit. Nothing wrong with riding the waves a bit using derivative vehicles like CFD's etc. One option would be to have a long position on the underlying asset (BTC) and then take long or short derivative positions as indicators warrant. That way, you get your cake and also eat it - you may profit in long run by buying and holding but you also could get lucky if you time your derivatives trading at the same time also. Maybe too risky for me personally, lol, but if you are quite clever you might be able to do it. What I would NOT do, is  short BTC itself. All indicators are that it has lots of room to go as sort of a "new gold".
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:57:18
I think other coins like LiteCoin will take over as the "currency" while BTC will be the "store of value" - in other words things like LiteCoin (or Monero, or Dash, etc.) would  be the crypto "cash" and BTC would be the crypto "gold".

I believe that blockchain will be here to stay in one form or another but of course I cannot know that Bitcoin itself is here to stay but I think it will always have at least some value as nostalgia / collectors item as being the first experiment in blockchain technology. I see blockchain as more b2b rather than b2c (for example, Ripple  using blockchain technology to facilitate banking payments between institutions). So to that extent I believe in blockchain and by extension Bitcoin. But no, I do not for one second think Bitcoin (or other digital currencies) will replace fiat. That is a sucker's bet. My plan is to invest and take out some profits and put those profits into more stable, long-lasting things like instruments related to traditional equities and bonds, etc. Just my opinion.

You know, a friend recently asked me what I would recommend in terms of good ways to save money and I told them to be safe buy like US savings bonds - everything other than that is a roll of the dice. If you want safe, go with US savings bonds - everything else you have to be willing to take a gamble.

I think blockchain is a great b2b technology of the future, whatever may happen to bitcoin.

Verge is a scam, pure and simple. It periodically announces a grand new technology for shielding IP addresses called "Wraith Protocol", pumps up the price, and then after that fictional "protocol" of course never comes out because it does not exist, the price falls again. They did it this past Halloween and I think they are still at it. The Feds really ought to arrest them all. They are CROOKS like in the movie "Boiler Room" - just that simple, fellas. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:00:16
Alt coins rise will fall for the most part including ether and litecoin because those have no real use cases besides pump and dump. Bitcoin could correct to 15 - 16 K support levels but I'd expect so thereafter for it to get moving again. With futures a reality now for bitcoin, it should have less volatility and steadily appreciate as adoption increases.

I'll bite - yeah it is digital gold as a store of value , back up, etc. NOT a currency. It might hit 20K by end of month with everyone talking about it and Ameritrade futures starting (provided they don't start shorting). My basic view is that blockchain is here to stay, Bitcoin has historical interest as the first experiment in blockchain (like Model T was first car made in assembly line). You don't drive Model T's to work but you might get one for collector value interest. Same with Bitcoin. It has historical value as blockchain first experiment and thus has value as collector's item - as a currency, hells no. (Edit: Blockchain will revolutionize b2b transactions (like ripple now doing) and many apps can be built on it (such as with ether) so lots of value, albeit backend, to blockchain - BTC was the pioneer here and thus will always have collector value interest but again, NOT as a currency because blockchain is basically a dev tool like HTML - it is not something consumers would need or want to use.)

I'd take the winnings and put it into a well diversified portfolio which a financial adviser (which I am not, lol) can help you  with.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:39:01
Put 5% of portfolio into crypto only - so in 5k example put like $4,750 into a safe index fund and $250 into btc. Ask a investment advisor to recommend good index fund (not one myself as disclaimer lol). Don't over extend is bottom line.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:06:47
I am bullish on Bitcoin but two things - never put more than 5% (tops) of your total portfolio in crypto - that is just common sense. So if you have 100K don't put more than 5 K in crypto. Also don't put more than say half of that crypto allocation into Bitcoin - diversify. There are other good crypto's out there - Ether, Litecoin, Ripple are possibilities.  Also I have latterly taken an interest in some of the more rare, exotic offerings like 42 though have not invested there yet. Bottom line crypto is not "magic" - it is an investment and belongs in a well diversified portfolio and again you should not only invest into BTC but other cryptocurrencies as well. Not sure what caused the big drop (of over 2K) this morning but this just goes to show you need to diversify and not bet all on one horse.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:50:54
For goodness sakes don't put more than 5% of portfolio into crypto so if you have 25K that is $1,250.00. Protect yourself from major risk. I think BTC has long term (5 or more years) upside still but you nevertheless ought not to risk more than 5% for any reason.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:21:10
It is about how much return you think there will be - say if you think it would go up 10X its current value, then 100 would turn into 1000 down the line (if you think that). Personally I think Bitcoin could get over the long run into the 500K - 1 Million range, say 50 times current value (so your hypothetical $100 would in that instance be worth $5000). But that time horizon could be who knows - 10 years ? 20 ?  30 ? That is why I say to only spend small amount you can afford and be willing to just wait and see. [I give this estimate based on estimate of total gold market value - if BTC catches gold, then its price would get into that range - a big "IF" to be sure, but something some see as at least possible.]
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:59:02
No. A thousand times no. I use discretionary money to buy BTC - in other words money I otherwise would blow at the mall. But I sure as heck won't dump my 401k (real money)  for it. That is remarkably imprudent. BTC is a speculation, albeit a fun speculation, and should be treated accordingly.

Also in the case of debt (been there, done that) - make that your first priority to take care of, and then say if you have an extra 50 or 100 bucks laying around that you were planning to spend on a new shirt, then you could forgo the new shirt and put into bitcoin as kind of a speculation type thing. But definitely getting debt managed is first priority (believe me, I have dealt with this issue of having to fix credit and all that - doable but takes time).
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:56:48
Bitcoin has scarcity compared to some of its rivals, also it is the first mover, so has historical interest there - basically it is a store of value for crypto or if nothing else a collectors item for crypto.

Deficit means higher interest rates which hurt stocks. Therefore one needs to diversify (into municipal and state bonds (NOT federal bonds which are riskier due to increased deficit) , REIT's, precious metals, and, yes, crypto). What is bad for one thing is good for another thing. This is bad for stocks but for other instruments - certain bonds, real estate, etc. it may be a good thing in terms of diversifying away interest related risk.

Only put in what you would otherwise spend on say dinner out. Don't put "real" money into any one asset - DIVERSIFY. The only "real money" investing you should do is in say a very well diversified index tracking fund or something equally diversified and conservative. Crypto is NOT a short cut from having to make smart investing decisions, and NEVER put more than 5% of your portfolio into it.

Agreed - I know I am speculating and accept the risks including that "Satoshi" may decide to unload one day, thereby destroying in effect the world . And that is the game. Thus nobody should put in more than they can easily lose.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:08:21
That is immature reaction. If Bitcoin is going to be a normal asset to compete with say gold , it needs to have the normal up and down cycles like everything else - this  "moon" talk is amateurish. I hope to see it settle into more normal pattern of slow yet steady accumulation. I am still bullish - but if it shoots up to 50K overnight you can be assured it will dive back down just as quickly.

SLOWLY, lol. There is a Windows App called "Bitcoin Miner" you can download for free. It is SLOW - took hours for me to get 200 Satoshi which is like a little under say 4 cents worth at current prices. I just did it for fun but not going to be wasting my CPU cycles on it for the most part. Better off buying at an exchange. Also use ipayyou.io wallet myself - they have a way to earn bitcoin by trading in amazon gift cards - no I am not "shilling" for them, lol, just a site I happen to like.

Sorry you feel bad. Hopefully today's drop was a result as some speculate of people selling BTC in order to buy its  alternatives like Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Gold.

Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, basically endless derivatives based on the original design. I think they are stupid and detrimental to long term BTC growth but bitcoin developers are childish and like the shiny new object like a 2 year old, so it will keep forking and keep getting hit in value as a result until it either is destroyed completely or they learn lesson and quit the fucking forking habit.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:11:08
you misunderstand bitcoin completely - it is just a store of value like gold (or my favorite, palladium). it will NEVER replace regular currency like dollars, euros, and so on. NEVER in a KAJILLION years. But as a store of value it is good and will continue to be so.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:34:35
First of all Satoshi is not a particular person - "he" was a group of devs the Japs hired to create bitcoin - the NSA knows all about them and has been monitoring them for years. Also it ain't supposed to replace fiat - neither does gold - BTC is a reserve like gold but u still need  fiat (or alt coins of some sort) to buy them and that is by design.

At the end of the day you are still factoring large numbers which is polynomial time hard - that is, it takes lots of TIME to do it in terms of CPU time so does not matter if you have a million small computers or 1 huge computer, you are still needing lots of TIME to do the job of mining which after all is really factoring.

If 1 million per BTC that would be roughly market cap of 20 trillion which is like what 10 times the annual US budget . That is a lot. But, including derivatives markets (CDO's, and all that) there is like 1.2 QUADRILLION dollars in all the world if you add up all the digital money plus actual paper out there so 20 trillion is like 1 and 2/3 percent of 1.2 quadrillion, say let's call that 1.6% of all the money in the world. Is it reasonable for BTC to do this? Say BTC is half of crypto so the total crypto market in this scenario is call it 40 trillion or call it 3.2% of all the word's money. That is pretty conservative for the total domination of all crypto with BTC being half that at 1.6%. So yeah 20 trillion a lot, but still only 1.6% of all the money available. So certainly doable. Basically for this to happen BTC would have to be 1 - 2 times the total gold valuation or be the "new gold" - that is already starting to happen. So, short answer 1 million us dollars per bitcoin is absolutely doable though not next month, lol.

It is all about the futures coming out next month. If Wall Street futures markets on  BTC prove popular that gets institutional money into buying BTC so then it is no longer the domain of Linux script kiddies but is the domain of grown ups in real life finance. One that happens the price could get up to 100 K over the mid term (2 - 5 years).
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:08:44
Best idea would be to buy a promising alt coin, then when that rises, sell for BTC. There are lots of promising ones out there - Ripple is one I think because it has real customer base already.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:56:00
OK, I'll bite. By Dec 31, 2019 (over two years hence from Nov 27, 2017) it will have hit 50K. By Dec. 31, 2022 (over five years hence from Nov 27, 2017) it will have hit 100K. Could be slightly aggressive, I know, but again with futures coming out (i.e. "for realsy" money, not hacker play money), things should be pretty bullish. :-)

That is a point yes, but I still like to have super (in my view anyway) secure storage so it is worth it (I won't say what online wallet I use since do not want to appear like a paid spokesperson lol).
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:13:17
I've have used both coinbase and cex.io to buy and then other places to store wallet (i.e. buy one place, then transfer over to wallet - I don't really care where I buy but am pretty anal about storage, lol).
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:22:34
you know, this is the achillles heal of the bitcoin. well two achilles heal. the first is the Japs decide to dump "Satoshi"'s wallet on the market, thereby crashing the market - "Satoshi" is really the Jap government using the "Satoshi" wallet of 1 million BTC for economic blackmail like a James Bond movie. so that is one risk. the other risk is Bitcoin forks all the time like a heroin addict returning to his stash after being unable to stay clean. If it forks too often , one day it will fork that once too many times, and crash to 0. so all quite risky but i still speculate cautiously. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:32:55
it has been correcting all day. chances are it will correct down at least to 9000.

First rule of bitcoin trading - buy it once place, and hold it somewhere else. I buy on cex.io and then transfer it to a wallet to hold. that is common sense. if u lose it on coinbase, that is your own dumb ass fault.

Well certainly would not presume to advise on storage - I think ultimately I will get a cold storage, offline hardware wallet, but for now an online storage that uses 2 Factor authentication (that is very important) is ok.

big money is both long and short so i think big picture this is positive in terms of getting institutional investors into the space
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:40:48
So the test will be once the futures markets start for Bitcoin on Wall Street like I think some will be next month. This could cause lots of money to move into the space. We will know in the next few months. Say if the price has got up by 50% in the ensuing months after the futures markets begin, then that means there is lots of momentum to go on further, but if the futures markets do not have much impact, then we could be just kind of holding steady for a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:17:15
I could be wrong but I am thinking BTC is the "new gold" which means it could take over (possibly at a premium) the total gold market value. So all the gold in the world is maybe 10 trillion (which if BTC cap were that it would be like 500K per Bitcoin). Add a 2X premium and that gets BTC to 20 trillion (1 million dollars per bitcoin). Much more than that is probably wistful thinking. I think bitcoin could get up to 1 - 2 times the gold market cap and then kind of just hover around  there. Why? Because BTC is a reserve currency. Other cryptos like Litecoin, Monero, possibly Dash, and who knows what else may be the crypto of  circulation but BTC will be the crypto of reserve. So good news is that BTC could have very, very long way still to go. But on the other hand it never gets above around a million (so not 5 million like some of said) because it is a reserve and investment at the end of the day and only in a secondary fashion is it a currency of exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:37:39
By 2030 I have seen estimates of 500K to even a million. That is only like 13 years from now - so if you pop $100 into it now, in 13 years that $100 could conceivable be worth 5 - 10 thousand or so - not bad long term investment.

yeah it is like alan shepard going to space - he got into space, sure, but it took until the space shuttle to stay up there for long  time- same thing here - BTC might touch 10K but will be while yet before it stays up there consistently. [not counting the moon landing in my analogy, that was faked by Stanley Kubrick and everyone and their dog knows that by now]
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:18:58
"Satoshi" - the pen name of the 4 devs who made this whole thing - kept 1 million BTC in one wallet address which has never been released. If it is released that will flood the market and everyone is fucked. Hence why President Obama got the NSA on the matter to stop this from happening.

@_date: 2017-11-26 17:33:36
Don't know about today - I believe in technical analysis and that says way, way over  bought right now. However next month futures start which gets institutional money into it, so I think it is very bullish picture over the next month or so. Time horizon of a month, yes, definitely 10K but in the next few days tech analysis which I trust more than I trust myself would say no. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:43:55
Also I  do not think "Satoshi" is one actual person - it is almost certainly a group of people (at least 3 - 5) - the code is FAR, FAR too complex for one person (speaking as a developer, I ought to know.)

So 10 million USD per 1 bitcoin means bitcoin market cap of over 200 trillion which is basically like all the money in the world more or less not counting digital derivatives money floated around by wall street. but basically all the "real life" money is 200 trillion - so no, bitcoin will never replace all the dollar bills, 1 quid coins, etc. in all the world. that is rediculous and stupid.

Scientific fact my friend -  - NSA conclusively knows who Satoshi (penn name) is - group of 3 - 4 devs. The only speculative part is who is behind it. I myself speculate it is the Jap government given that Satoshi is an anagram for Jap corporations. But maybe it is some other government - but that is just my educated guess. what is not in dispute is "Satoshi" is really a group of people, the NSA knows these people's identities, and is on top of the situation.

Well not all are mined out yet - even the mega rich still have to pay for the mining equipment and so forth to mine. Just like no matter how rich you are you cannot just "buy all the world's gold" - you have to pay for the mining drills and so on, just like everyone else. Laws of physics / geology stop someone however  rich from getting all the gold - by same token how Bitcoin is designed there are CPU requirements etc. for mining though to be fair I am not an expert there. Basically there are no "easy"  (deterministic polynomial time complete) ways to factor large numbers, so mining will always be "hard", (non-deterministic polynomial time complete), even for rich people. ;)

Awesome. In my view Bitcoin will be the next "store of value" like gold or silver. Other crypto currencies will come and go but Bitcoin will be there, so even small investments long term will pay off big time. I've been doing similar, just putting a little bit at a  time in when I can, and already seeing some good return percentages.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:52:36
NSA knows who they ("Satoshi") are - 4 people one of whom may have passed away by now. Likely state actor. Personal theory is the Empire of Japan is behind it, and hired 4 devs to do it, and the only people who have the private key holding "Satoshi's" wallet are perhaps the Prime Minister of Japan (in some sort of "football" briefcase) and perhaps Emperor Akihito himself may also have access. This is all but certain. They likely have this as both a reserve value for an emergency like an earthquake or something but also as a military deterrence (i.e. if the Empire of Japan is threatened by N. Korea they can threaten to offload all their BTC, thus crashing the world economy) so basically it is economic black mail. Fine by me since they are a US ally so I am not too worried about it.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:16:11
Maybe it is the next Tulip mania. But remember this, Tulips literally built Wall Street. Those who got rich on Tulips in Amsterdam took their winnings, went to the New World, and used their money to found New Amsterdam on the southern end of an island they bought from the Native Americans called Manhatten - this small fort / settlement was bordered to the north by a wall going east and west across the island - the road that ran alongside this northern border wall of the New Amsterdam settlement was called, wait for it, Wall Street. So even if it is a bubble, people will still make out very well before it bursts. :-)

What is your time frame ? It cannot shoot up indefinitely. That said, it can grow over time with some resets / pullbacks. I'd say conservatively it hits 10K by the end of the year and then who knows it could grow several times over the next year also. I have seen estimates for the highest value it could get anywhere from 500K to 1 Million  but numbers of 500K to 1 Million is not expected for say a decade or more. Really past a month in the future it is anyone's guess and that goes not just for crypto but currencies in general.

Good job! Congrats! Maybe if I can consolidate enough myself I may do the same - sell my crypto and use the profits (after taxes) to buy a more traditional portfolio that generates interest I can live off of - never spend principle - just use your profit principle to buy a well-diversified portfolio that gives you interest and / or dividends (or even buy annuity if you are super conservative) and then you have interest to live on for the rest of your life. That is what knock on wood I hope to one day do though unfortunately I got on this train a little late in the day so do not (yet) have very much position.

You know sometimes I wonder if Satoshi is a real life John Galt, who "stopped the motor of the world" - I wonder if he built this whole thing just to create a Tulip Bubble so he could sell and burst it, and then stand back and watch the world burn, as some sort of post-modern art project. I hope this is not true, but to me this is the one real risk that Bitcoin has. If Satoshi - whoever he or she is, or maybe even a group of people - decides to sell all at once, the entire western financial system is fucked.
