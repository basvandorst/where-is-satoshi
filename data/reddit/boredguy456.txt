You know if they openly advertise the tech to clients, this could generate huge buzz around a lot of people.

You do realize you need to pay taxes right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:13:12
Okay, I've seen you sling a lot of accusations, But I have yet to see you post links to anything nor anything other than you saying there are regular attacks. What information are you using?
Also, mods, if this thread actually shows useful info, can I get a sticky?

My view on it is that big blocks are just a bandaid on gangrene. It can ease the symptoms for a while, but eventually that block will have to be bigger and bigger to keep in time with scaling, making bitcoin more and more expensive to buy equipment for. Eventually bigger blocks would lead to a "server farm quality or GTFO" mentality. 
Right now, blocks are not the solution. Making the process more efficient in the long term is. The less effort it takes for a computer to process the chain, the better off we'll be when we are decades in the future.

Pretty sure [these guys]( are trying something similar.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:28:01
I would 1. Ask them for the policy of which they speak and have them talk about the specific thing you are doing. 2. Explain to them how this is incorrect. 3. If they persist, simply tell them you would like a full withdrawal of your money.

Alright, there's one message that shows pretty obvious knowledge of coinbase, but nothing he couldn't talk his way out of. What about the attacks?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:46:21
I have yet to see how this is directly attacking cryptocurrencies. From what I'm seeing, they're updating phrasing to include digital currencies into laws that are already in existence for currency, and updating to include wallets/exchange holdings in rules already enforced on traditional bank accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:33:40
Okay, same as last time I saw this, do you have any solid sources that can prove that bitcoin is being attacked? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:14:06
The "start free trail" button could use some spell check love. Otherwise so far it looks great! As a noob, can confirm is noob friendly.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:26:56
No problem!
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:44:10
Can confirm. Sold my measly 400 USD worth a few days before the split to help with bills. Instant regrets. But my coinbase account is empty, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.

The sidebar is a great place to start! 
My two cents: Don't. Not until you research further into bitcoin and crypto currencies in general, and decide that it's worth putting money into. After that, decide what you're doing with your bitcoin. Hodl (investing long term)? Trading? Or using it for everyday transactions? Personally, I'm trading as my first steps into doing it for a living. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:41:35
I don't believe in regulation as much as governmental oversight. At the end of the day, for bitcoin to truly become mainstream, it needs not necessarily governmental direction, but acceptance. If Bitcoin can be painted as a threat to a country's finances, you can bet they will do what they can to shut it down.

Probably never gonna get released. He's a political prisoner, they never want him to be able to talk to anyone ever again.

Actually, my roommate uses the lack of the ability to create or get rid of coins as his main counter-argument against bitcoin, as he understands that point as the reason bitcoin cannot grow in the future once all coins have been passed out through the miners. Unfortunately I'm relatively new compared to 2011, so what would be your response to that?
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:17:14
What's this?
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:41:26
No confidence? What caused that? I see people making adoption posts all the time here
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:51:41
Could someone explain the drop off? I'm not finding anything on what's going on.
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:34:06
Since we're talking investments: Bitcoin is still by modern considerations a speculative investment with high risk. If you are looking to make money fast, this is not the place. That being said, Bitcoin has an impressive track record in the long term, and is nowhere near finished growing. Go review the White paper, and catch up on what the community has done to progress from there. If you like what you see, go ahead and buy bitcoin and leave it in a wallet. Don't get caught up in headlines, learn the community's mentality, and you should be alright.

Something we in America learned when the U.S. was taken off of the gold standard: currency itself does not have value. Currency is merely what is used to obtain that which does have value.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:24:16
What? No, you missed the point entirely. No currency actually has value, we just use it to get things *with* value. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:58:43
ah, that explains a few things. thanks for the clear up

too late for that angle. big names like JP Morgan are starting to dip into bitcoin, we'll have friends with big wallets soon, for better or worse.
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:46:19
Wait, what about those that know what it represents and want to make money off of it?
