It either hasn't sailed because they will finally after a stupid long time adopt protocols to reduce fee cost and increase transaction speed, or it has sailed because Bitcoin is just going to rot away as the first major cryptocurrency that became a shit coin in the face of innovation.  If the latter is the case, then actually, you are potentially ahead of most everyone else.  You just have to do some due diligence and find who will most likely win for the near future.

Digital spending is possible with digital fiat, but I don't think you understand how block chains work if you think double spending is a vulnerability to block chains.

This is partly why alt coins exist and why they too have legitimate value and why many people who are invested for a long time hold the opinion that Bitcoin will be phased out for a superior block chain cryptocurrency, of which multiple already exist and have proliferated.  What takes Bitcoin a long time to move, other currencies can move that data/money instantly because their network is not throttled by population the way Bitcoin is. 
The counterpoint is that while this may make PayPal competitive, it still does not make banks competitive.  There is no cryptocurrency that exists or will ever exist that takes 3-5 business days to transfer your money.

Because you completely read it wrong.  I'm not going to get into the specific financial bullshit he did but he did not ruin my grandparents estate, he ruined ours, that is, my mother and I's, including but not limited to my own credit score by asking for my credit card to help pay for groceries when I was none the wiser about the true financial situation we had which I only learned when I tried to order a video game online and my credit card was frozen and I called BofA and was told I had an outstanding debt of the max amount of my credit card. In the end, we moved away from Florida to live in my grandparents' old home that was in our family for generations when we could've just done that in the first place and not lived a financial lie that caused us to go broke.  He was dishonest because he was embarassed and I sympathize with that but it is still not even remotely a good enough excuse when I consider the many deliberate decisions he made to hide our financial problems from people who were directly impacted by them until it was too late.  I would much rather him kept the various investment vehicles that he had maxed out in the course of his life and not ruined my credit, which has wasted 3-4 years of my life as I wish to apply for a business loan but can't because of debt I never took on personally.  I have had to waste a lot of money and time getting a great credit score which was literally almost perfect by the time I was 17 by following the very advice he gave me.

No, it's what banks that fractionally lend do.  That happens to be every major bank left in the modern world, but that is not the same as saying every bank that ever existed ir will exist has to operate that way.   It shouldn't work, it technically doesn't work, and the hubris will catch up with itself even if it takes many generations.  Banks have many legitimate ways to make money on loans and safeguardingwith safer margins than they operate in.  They are simply not asked to play safe or be held responsible with playing with fire and that's how we get to the insane lending margins they operate under today.

In 2008 my dad sold all of his investment portfolio and we went broke.  He sold time shares and insurance his whole life and is the smartest individual I know when it comes to money that is not a financial professional.  I learned that year that nobody learns because learning is an intellectual matter and these things speak to your emotional side and can beget you to make irrational decisions even if you knew better your entire life and have seen it happen many many times.  My grandparents are wealthy, and we could've reduced our standard of living, but instead he was caught up in the emotional turmoil of having to keep our standard of living up at any cost rather than just making the smartest financial decisions available to be able to hodl through the market crash that would inevitably correct and has consistently done so since the creation of the Fed.

Money is not a service nor is it provided by the government.  Money is a proof of value that is agreed upon by two parties in an exchange involving goods that allow people to trade without having to trade goods that one party does not desire.  That proof of value was created by banks and is entirely dependent on the person receiving the money having faith that the bank is "good for it."  The government makes jurisdiction as to how they operate, but it is a very common and misunderstood position that the government itself is in control of the money.  If that were the case, the government would have prevented multiple crises.  It is precisely that they aren't in control that there is a central bank as a last resort.

Your metaphor makes sense if the US actually grew its investments twice as much as others and took 10% and never lied and always paid on time.  Literally none of these things are true.  Their money is fake and is attached to nothing but a central bank that inflates the value of the fake money to cover up for mistakes that banks make, which does not fix them but only prolong the mistake and by doing so create a bigger explosion when the mistake is exposed.  Every time the US explodes, it goes further into debt, mainly to China.  You are straight up on crack thinking "everyone trusts the US economy" or that anything about Mr. Brown is an accurate description of the American economy.   The US Fed has been the most irresponsible central bank in the entire world in the last 2 decades and the main culprit behind the last 2 bubbles.

There was no guarantee of anything happening.  We operate on educated guesses.  Like I said, if you planned to get back in, all you did was wound yourself financially.  I would not recommend anyone to invest in cryptocurrency with an amount of money that would be concerning to lose precisely because you hurt your ability to make money off of it at all if you always operate on the basis of pulling out as soon as it goes down.
Say you buy in at 10k, sell order at 9500
9500 happens and within 2 minutes it goes up to 12k
What's your move?  This is the situation you describe and it happens all the time in cryptocurrency.  You just lost 5% of your money and if you reinvest now you will be using the same amount of money for a 20% premium purchase when if you just held you'd have made that 20%.  It's a necessary evil to do this in day trading very quickly, it is not smart to do this in long-term investing.

There is no world where I desire banks as they exist.  The value of police is to protect society from criminals and enforce laws.  The value of banks is to store money and provide lending using the money they store as a basis of trust.  The exact moment where banks were allowed to lend money they didn't have is the exact moment their usefulness ends and their corruption of the economy they exist in begins.

I would file the quantity of each coin under "other currency" and not attribute a dollar amount to it since a dollar amount is not fixed unless I'm trying to illustrate a realized loss or gain.  If it's still a coin it's just a coin you paid for, and what you have is what you have and what it's worth is relative to the day.  If it's advantageous to you to put the price of the day there, then do so, otherwise, like you said, no realization of loss or gain means no USD amount to really report until you do.

They don't need a validation of authority, they have it and you are not the one who gives it.  What they need is a reality check and only honest discussion allows that.  A portion of politicians are not corrupt - it is important to generally assume that they are not unless proven otherwise, and if not proven, they are just ignorant.  If they are ignorant, well, we need to enlighten them.  They have jobs they focus on all day.  They can't learn about everything in the world.  They are forced to listen to everyone else and make an educated decision, and that's in an ideal world.  The only way to change things with legitimate politicians is discourse, and for the corrupt, money you can't afford.  So, I see it as you should be taking a shot at every senator hoping a few are good and will fight the good fight.  If nothing else expose who won't.

Inflationary fiat is manipulated by debt of commercial banks.  Using a currency that can't be assigned a fee for lending which is greater than its inflationary value creates a competitive environment against banks, except their competition is a ghost person. It's just a tool.  A tool superior to theirs because it doesn't thirst for wealth, it simply operates.  Bankers are not just other players in the game.  They are more like the Dungeon Masters in a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.  They can create arbitrary rules to make the journey easy or hard, and like many DMs, they often fall to some ridiculous hubris and ruin their game for everyone.  With crypto, people have, not in all cases but in many of the banks' primary functions, the opportunity to not play the game they've been forced to play against their consent by existing in a country with a central bank.
Put it another way.  Imagine a bank had to actually take a risk with every investment.  They don't actually have to do that if they operate in a country where they can create a loan in the currency they operate in so long as that currency is technically infinite.  There's no risk if the money you lend is imaginary.  You're not giving anything away.  It's just paperwork that others agree has value.  There isn't even actual legal tender being exchanged.
With deflationary assets, that is, finite crypto currency, banks have no ability to create that money.  They actually have to lend you legitimate principal and trust that you will pay it back otherwise they are fucked.  Laws meant to recoup money aside, that is not something banks actually have to do in the modern age and is something I don't think people even understand.  This is precisely why gold was removed from the American banking system - it is a show of trust that, while I can't speak for them, I'll assume they felt had no real advantage over the advantage of being able to print money that could be lent out for higher than inflation's cost.  When you hide that fake money agreement document behind a central bank that holds real life money tender to give to your bank just in case everyone freaks out and asks for their money back at the same time, it then takes A LOT of people asking for their money for the truth to be revealed about how little money the banks actually have, but when they do the bank is not just fucked by that one deal that was faked, every fake deal on their books at the time explodes.  Cooked books is an infinite understatement when it comes to bank accounting and fiat in the last 40 years.
If you are educated about the sub-prime mortgage loan created crisis 10 years ago, I want you to imagine a world where it could ever exist within a cryptocurrency based market.  Imagine a world where a bank is so confident in people that literally can be measured based on their paychecks to have no ability to pay off their loans being given a loan that requires a bank to give them money they actually care about.  Such a thing will never exist.  It's only when a bank is able to make money for free that it's not a risk to give out a shitty loan, if literally any loan will make them money.  
I just wrote a fucking shitload but my last few sentences is what it comes down to.  Banks can give out loans at will so long as the government lets them.  Only the government's leash determines how bad loans can be as they are given out, because the truth is, banks, not the central bank that holds them up, but the commercial banks that distribute loans do so because that is their primary form of profit.  To loan is create money, to create money is to make money.  If you can't create money, you can't make bad decisions based on loans or you will end up loaning out money you have and it won't come back.  The level of risk banks deal with is virtually zero.

You are not considering the influence of developer consensus.
Let's say some developers of a coin realize people like the coin.  They realize people keep using the coin and that their main form of monetary gain off of it is to make money on in/out process of fiat and coin exchanges - similar to what the IRS does with various securities and assets.
Let's say they get greedy over time.  Let's say they realize they can collude with major miners who control huge portions of the network.  Slow down the network.  Drive up fees.  Offer an alternate solution, an off-chain network that makes everything go super fast!  You don't pay a premium now, but there's no reason you won't later to cover costs for this and that - and hold on, now you have another conglomerate of developer consensus to deal with on the off-chain network.  One group already devolved into typical behavior of humans in control, and now they're going to let others in on it?  Also consider that the government, while it can't easily track on-chain transactions... off-chain is an entirely different story.  You get off the chain, you get off decentralization, you allow exploitation just like it's always been since before there was cryptocurrency in the first place.

By late betting I specifically mean to place your bet in the time between the spin and "no more bets."  I should be clear since late betting is not allowed and what I meant is to get your bet in after the number crunch but before no more bets.
There are many stories of people trying to replicate what you are suggesting.  People have spent hours in a casino for years at a time writing down numbers hoping to find patterns.  The truth is, every event in roulette has a very minimal dependency on the last event, only based on certain circumstances such as the dealer picking up a ball from the slot it was dropped, but the consistency dies instantly because there's no guarantee a dealer doesn't spin the ball at a different speed, begin spinning the ball at a different time, that the wheel is going the same exact speed as the last speed (virtually guaranteed it isn't).  
Roulette for the last few decades has had its table manufactured specifically to be incalculable in the limited time you have to bet unless you are using a cheating device.  Correlation of previous spins is only possible on imbalanced wheels, and I work in a small casino relative to Vegas casinos and even here we have a state official along with a manager measure many facets of the wheel during the opening of the game to ensure there is no imbalance.  If there is no imbalance, you cannot predict the wheel without a computer.  It's simply impossible.  I've trained myself to use my eye to predict the wheel based on wheel trajectory, ball entry position, spin speed, etc and it is simply not consistent enough to beat the game.  If it was, I'd be a roulette player and not a roulette dealer.
You're going to lose your money doing this even if you are lucky short term, I assure you.  I've tried to figure out how to beat every game in our casino.  There is more to the game than the rules of the game that appear obvious.  Casino personnel regularly hold meetings and discuss how their games are cheated and tighten up their procedures regularly.  Only card counting has survived as a method to beat the house and because of large shoes with 6 decks the correlation between counting and successful betting is so minimal that you really have to basically go out of your way to convince dealers to cut shoes thin and ideally be playing 4 or less decks.  The problem is every casino knows that and their surveillance is aimed specifically at the ideal games to cheat them.

Consider how many alt account sales on WoW were not reported to the IRS.  Kinda makes me laugh actually.

They never could be, they were just in control of the means for which your work was given financial value, whether labor or business.  I would be very scared of an internet coin that can turn my fake paper money into global money without a fee and can be exchanged without a government regulator taking a middle man fee.  What I don't think people understand more than anything about Bitcoin is it is destroying the very basis of the dollar's value by its own existence.  The point of the dollar for the people who print dollars is to beat inflation with fees that basically allow them to print money.  If banks can't make free money, there is no point in making more dollars, and the realization of that will cause a gigantic sweeping loss of confidence where the dollar is used, which is nearly everywhere.  The fact that bitcoin circumvents these fees is going to rapidly accelerate the collapse of the most speculative bubbles in major first world countries that have relied on central banking to hide their corrupt and toxic assets which will be exposed as having no value as they often get exposed eventually.

So hold until you lose and then sell?  The fuck are you talking about?  If you're implying you can put your money into an exchange with a stop-loss below the price you bought in for, sure, but unless you plan to never get back in, you just lost a small amount of money for no reason.  If you keep it in the entire time and it recovers, you don't lose any money.
Doing that doesn't cut your losses, it realizes them.

Right? I used to live 5 miles from A1A, that shit scares me now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:52:23
They were right but not for the right reasons.  If you follow the basis for them believing that you will quickly lose all your money even if your first decision is correct.

Hell to the fuck no, unless they are very computer literate they are probably scared of the implications of the volatility as well as hacking potential.  It's much safer to let businesses which have been evading taxation for years to do what they're good at.  Lesser evil, so to speak.

You don't seem to respect the idea that if the police come and take all your shit and make you fight in court for 10 years, you're still getting all your stuff taken and your time held up for 10 years until you get it back after paying massive fees and giving up tremendous future opportunity just to try to fight for what you already had.  In other words, it's not a legitimate safeguard.

He was the leading salesman at Wyndham's Florida operations and then managed the most successful time share sales team in South Florida even outside of Wyndham for multiple years in a row at one point.  He manages my grandparents' extremely wealthy portfolio personally and re-allocates their assets.  My point was that his life is basically sales and money but is not really a true "financial professional."  He is significantly more experienced than nearly everyone on reddit when it comes to understanding the basics of buying and selling things and making a profit, both by trade and by familial obligation to the point where financial professionals are the only individuals who have given me more wisdom than him on the subject - and yet he erred greviously with his own finances due to emotions.  He is not a scummy rip-off artist and it is very apparent if you try to ask him anything finance related that he has a lot of wisdom.  For example, where most people act like a dumb cunt about Bitcoin if they overhear me talking about it, my dad was skeptical but asked a lot of questions involving the history of it, major actors, whether I properly assessed the risks, if I knew the legal ramifications involved and a lot of questions that any smart person should be asking but is not obvious to ask.  He is no genius but I'm not gonna let you disrespect him because you have some silly opinion about salesman.
It takes a lot for me to give him credit because that stupid ass decision has basically wasted at least 3-4 years of my life and forced me to start from a significantly more disadvantaged position.  I was very bitter for a long time precisely because I knew for a fact he was managing our grandparents' money and should understand very well the basic no-no of not pulling your money out during the crash/bubble burst/correction.  I don't think you understand what time shares actually are if you think these people are stupid or don't get how money works even if they aren't an investment firm.  In my experience, the places where my dad worked at look and operate almost scarily similar to what investment firms seem to act like after they hang up and thank you for your service.  They are greedy and ruthless and weak hands do not survive.  He made a lot of other people a lot of money and was nonetheless subject to his own emotional weakness.

Yeah I'm far from an attorney but that's exactly how I interpret it.  As a rule, the IRS doesn't care what you buy as long as it's legal,  they just care about everything involving you making money.  I couldn't tell you what will happen with this law, frankly I didn't even click the OP, I scrolled down the comments, saw multiple people call bullshit on what was said and moved on.  I was just telling you what I'm planning on doing based on the research I've done up to this point so I don't get fucked in the ass.

I was 16 in 2007.  I lived in Florida, saw everything happen. Early 2009 I said, "I wish I was old enough that I had capital.  This is the only time I've seen reasonable Florida prices."  Instead because of being a kid stuck in a financial crisis I had to move away.
What I'm trying to say is, for me, Bitcoin is a bet against the American economy, its greed, and my ability to circumvent the extreme loss as the value of the dollar and the value of things bought with dollars dies is what I'm hoping will lead to me buying that cheap Florida house when it comes around again.

Your principle in real world value amounts to you not existing.  Principles are important and I stubbornly stick to mine as well, but often times principles come into conflict.  I don't trust politicians.  I do trust that a few of them fighting against regulation will in the end make the industry healthier even if a majority of them will be bought and do nothing but ridiculous evil shit.  If there is no resistance at all, the evil just comes faster, you know?  I wanted to be a politician at one point, try to change things.  I realized that everyone appears guilty by association.  Not everyone is guilty of corruption though, it's just an easy thing to assume.

You can be paid in bitcoins.

There are systems around it, but adoption of a digital currency requires the ability for the business to be able to charge their service that way.  If they're not prepared, it can't be done.  So, it takes time.  In the mean time, bitcoins are being created.  There is a maximum but it has not yet been reached.
