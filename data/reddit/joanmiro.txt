Pictures that can make people curious about. For example you've sneaked madonna's backstage and took ugly photos of her. Instead of selling these pictures to newsletters you can put them on that site and make madonna fans pay for it.

I know, but all files are served from gallery owner's dropbox account. My site is will not serve any file. I thought that i can stay away from responsibility of content by doing this.
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:17:21
Nobody interested? :\
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:55:55
We have to think that what happens a man uploads a child porn  to dropbox then share it's link to reddit? Both reddit and dropbox responsible? If it is i've to build an adminstration mechanizm.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:29:58
Yes, porn pics would be work good for with. r/gonewild girls can use for striptease photosets.

because i'm about to lose my motivation :)
@_date: 2016-03-14 07:45:56
Python SDK is not complete. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 09:37:05
But too expensive for me :)
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:57:22
But to run bitcoin core you have to download about 20GB data isn't it? I don't want to do this.
Update: I've checked now, it's 80GB.
@_date: 2016-03-07 10:07:04
What you mean with you don't have to store it? Can I delete data file when it's synched?
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:55:14
check this  
@_date: 2016-03-11 09:38:10
I liked this service but it's using float numbers to describe amounts of bitcoin. Floats are evil in programming world. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 17:39:24


I think that tipping button save my life. Thanks bro.
@_date: 2016-06-25 07:52:12
Hi! there is an update: Verified users feature arrived to unpix.in, this was most wanted feature since I begin that project.
@_date: 2016-06-30 15:35:31
No BTC or USD
@_date: 2016-06-30 16:14:08
Sorry I misunderstand you, what is DAO tokens?
@_date: 2016-06-30 15:08:28
ahaha :) you've beaten me with my gun :D
@_date: 2016-06-30 15:35:36
BTC or USD
@_date: 2015-11-25 20:00:18


Great scott! :) Yo're right I've to fix this. 


At the moment nobody is submitting money except me.
@_date: 2015-11-26 07:06:50


Think that you're fan of someone, and he/she is sharing something that you can not find somewhere else. I think you would be interested?


When transaction happened, it does wait for only one confirmations. It's very fast actually.


I've thought that clips4sale model before. Problem is, when you're published a clip to someone it instantly goes to torrents and another websites. Nobody wants to pay for that content when It's available at another places. This model is more protective for publishers.
@_date: 2015-11-25 18:35:41
Here is an example, that needs 5.0BTC to reveal. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 18:02:39
It was not when i've posted this.
@_date: 2015-11-26 06:12:14
Nice project, but this is simpler one.
@_date: 2015-11-25 20:01:10
Actually I was thinking about that, do you have any idea? May be I can pay all money back to tippers.
@_date: 2016-05-17 04:57:32
It's good to hear.
@_date: 2016-05-20 11:27:06
Hmm nice way to solve, whick programming language do you use?
@_date: 2016-05-20 21:58:20
What is meaning of being alive?
@_date: 2016-05-16 14:15:01
It's mBtc and it's testnet coins :) I'll switch to bitcoins when some people appears and says "Hey I want to earn money with this"
@_date: 2016-05-16 14:18:30
Can you describe that trustless concept?
@_date: 2015-11-25 19:08:43
Yes, may be.
@_date: 2015-11-26 06:23:48
If it starts to make money, I'll build a version that supports videos.
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:34:34
I've added this to my notes, but it can be good if this post was at @_date: 2016-05-17 21:23:15
And... here is my selfie 
@_date: 2016-05-17 04:57:19
Open In Bitcoin App button will be working when site starts to use real bitcoins, it's using testnet coins now.
@_date: 2015-11-26 07:09:57
If Kim Kardassian would use this, I would be rich.
@_date: 2016-05-16 13:54:57
You can use this to test sending bitcoins to posts. 
And... please subscribe to subreddit to hear when unpix.in starts to use real bitcoins:
@_date: 2016-05-20 08:34:48
The wallet has about 22$ but it think brute force would not work
@_date: 2016-05-17 21:25:50
for now you can mail to admin [at] unpix.in, I would be happy to receive emails.
@_date: 2015-11-26 07:07:41
Can I get verified gonewild usernames from reddit api? O_o
@_date: 2016-05-18 16:29:41
Yes :)
@_date: 2016-05-16 13:41:21
This is a good example,  send testnet coins here to unpixelate image
@_date: 2016-05-20 21:43:26
What is meaning of this post?
@_date: 2016-05-18 09:07:42
There's no need for android app, it's fully compatible with mobile browsers.
@_date: 2015-11-25 18:08:49
* You post an image with a goal of BTC.
* People start to tips your image. 
* Image displayed pixelized until goal is reached. (Will be displayed less pixelized when it's closing to it's goal)
* When goal is reached image will be totally revealed.
* When goal is reached system sends tips to your wallet. (It does not work at this prototype)

NP, I'm using JQuery Chunked Uploads: 
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:56:38
If I do that people never trusts unpixin again, why would I prefer a "hit and escape" instead of continous income? I've put a lot of effort to build unpixin.
@_date: 2016-05-16 14:21:39
Thanks, let's create a post and spread it :)
@_date: 2015-11-26 07:15:32
Actually, I don't know much about vanity addresses. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 21:24:52
it's on mainnet now.
@_date: 2016-05-16 15:10:10
At bottom, there's a latest posts link.
@_date: 2016-05-16 14:17:02
Yes video and audio support are on the way but first, I need to see that people are using it.
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:20:09
Wow... at first, I thought that unpixin probably run on selfies of girls, but redditors invented another (and more funny) way to use it :)
@_date: 2016-05-16 21:15:11
That was me, and it was prototype of unpix.in :)
@_date: 2015-11-25 18:34:34
Yes! :) it needs cooler design.
@_date: 2016-07-26 10:33:20
Content is king. I know blogger websites making better hits from sites that have domain.
@_date: 2016-07-26 11:47:21
Thank's a lot!
@_date: 2016-05-16 13:38:58
I need some girls to make test posts BTW
@_date: 2016-07-01 10:12:36


:) we can not be master of everything. I think you can explain me
