Is there a danger with listing your address publicly or is it just a privacy issue?

Thanks again!

I'll take your files and email them to you for bitcoin. Been doing it since 2004.

Thanks! I've been spending the little bitcoin I do have, it's not really worth hoarding it in my eyes, so this'll probably go towards part of a humble bundle in the future :)

I use the official bitcoin client (I think?)  is the program details
My address that I have on the client is 1Bj7ESvZ1zSEES4YoUfhq7eARBxPjJdQ9b
The only bitcoin i've ever had was one I got from it was pretty cool seeing a $2.92 tip go to almost $10's value and i've bought a couple humble bundles using the bitcoin I was tipped.
I like to lurk in mostly, it's fun to watch something I remember being $4 go up so high.

I've been interested in making a bitcoin wallet but never really had a reason to, care to give me a reason? :P Happy cake day as well.

I hope you bought those 100 bitcoins.
