Weird, they didn't have me send in anything at all. Just answer some questions.
Edit: Just wanted to ask if you have reached out to them yet. I reached out to them on Twitter when their app wasn't working and they got back to me right away to help. They seem like a responsive bunch.

Your version was better written, too.

He seems biased the entire article, and then in the last sentence he basically says he likes it. It's really misleading.

That was really hard to read. 3 paragraphs describing how he swiped the card wrong. Her seems really biased, too.
For the record, I have a Shift card and have had zero problems with it. I love how it makes bitcoin so much more accessible. I would love to spend bitcoin directly in more places, but until that is possible, this is a good step in the right direction.

Autocorrect is awesome.

I have a Shift visa that authorizes instantly and pulls money from my Coinbase account. It's not quite what you describe, but it's a stereo in the right direction.

That's not exactly how it works, Newegg. But I still love you for accepting Bitcoin.

As an actual user, I agree completely with this post. Please don't break my magical internet money.

The usual response to requests for proof is to post some proof.

I love my bitcoin visa card. When I can buy things with bitcoin directly, I will. But in the meantime, my grocery store accepts visa, not bitcoin. This lets be buy normal, everyday items without having a bank involved.

Having no idea what he was talking about was why he asked the question in the first place.
