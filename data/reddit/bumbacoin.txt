mining as a business vs hobby,
as i understand it, declaring values every year vs capital gains as manifest

i received some advice (from Munros) that when hobby mining you do not declare as income but rather as a CGT event when converting mined coins.
this is confusing with hardware depreciation though when the coins are held for over 12 months - with the advice i received suggesting depreciation is relevant for the mining period, which is obviously in the previous financial year.

he actually links that same question/article on bitcoin.stackexchange in another tweet.
so he's probably talking about it but giving incorrect examples
@_date: 2018-08-20 06:13:08
99% of all coins still use the term bitcoin to refer to various code aspects.
see  for example

also here is the method to do what CSW describes

his comment was totally taken out of context

you can generate addresses which seem valid , so you can send coins to them, but are not actually valid, which means you can never actually spend them. These are legit burner addresses.
the examples up there may be no different to a vanity address, where if you do happen to "luckily" create the privkey they are spendable. These are only heat death of the universe burner addresses.

for whatever reason he seems correct about those as seeming vanity addresses rather than true burn addresses and wrong with his efforts.
5/10 CSW

i think this might be a provably unspendable address

cos when bitcoin.com has a wallet that calls something 
bitcoin which is actually bitcoin cash .. 
obviously there seems some issue to be addressed
whatever all the fake *freedom bullshit is, deliberate lies and confusion is not freedom.
