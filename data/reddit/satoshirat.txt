@_date: 2013-08-29 16:01:07
Added all stuff for better transparency.

I answered this in more detail on [bitcointalk forums](
In short, automatically after each game if your balance exceeds 0.0102 BTC.

Yes, but how can i implement the speed of the rat in a way that can be verifiable, but cannot be pre computed by a rat before games?
The last rat who joins the race, in theory can look on blockchain and can see everything about his competitors, and if he sees his odds are not with him, he delays his payment. so i cannot use data from there.

Everything is public, all games are visible, the rats that run in the race, their speed in the race.(i also record the exp, health, stamina for each particular race and i can add this additional info when you view the race). 
You can also check all transactions coming and going from the game address.(they are all visible in the block chain)
This way it will be clear if a rat only has unusual speeds and are not statistically correct.
Other than that i am open for suggestions.
I am trying very hard to establish trust in the bitcoin community and to raise any doubts i will not play in this game. Occasionally, if someone reports a bug or a problem with some payments, probably i will have to test that, but other game mechanics i'll test them on my test server.
thx

0 or not, you still have to wait for the next turn, which takes 10 minutes.
Only at the beggining of a new turn the games are set up.

I checked that and ya, now i know what you meant, i'll try to find a way similar to the betting sites. thx

they do. Actually game 5 and 6 took place on the same time. 
I noticed a display bug and game 5 shows as the last game instead of game 6 and i will fix it tomorrow.

every 10 minutes there is a turn. If there are only 4 people, the turn passes without a race, but the rats still heal and rest.

An augmentation giveaway is in effect. All rats who lose more than 0.05 BTC will get 2 augmentations worth 0.1105 BTC.

I'll copy paste from bitcointalk forum, the mechanism i have to defend agains this:
Always lower level players are associated in a race first. If in the game queue there are 7 rats, 5 low level, 2 high level, the first game will be with the 5 low level rats, leaving the other 2 waiting in the game queue.
If another 5 new players come, again they will be associated first leaving the other 2 behind.
At a new level you gain +1 speed. So a battle between a level 1 rat and a level 2 will be a battle between rand(10,31) and rand(10,32), a little edge in my opinion.
Also i am considering, when players do get to some high levels, to not associate races if the level difference is to much. A level 9 rat cannot go in a race with a level 1, but only to let say level 5-13.
It is true, high level will have a small advantage over low level, but i am trying to minimize as much as i can this advantage, and permit new players catch up in leveling.

In order to become provable fair, changes had to be made to the engine and now it uses DnD style rolls.
That what i wanted to say with other minor changes.

Enter your bitcoin address, click search and you will see all your games. You can click on them.
Then go to the url and modify the gameid into what number you want.
Currently 6 game already took place.
I'll add tomorrow a way to easily see and click on all games that took place, if someone wants to check on them quickly.

All races start at the same time. If 15 rats are waiting in the queue 3 races will start at the start of a new turn.
Also 5 rats can have multiple games pending, so again more races can start at the same time, even between same rats.
