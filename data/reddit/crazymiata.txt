Yes, you can use a higher fee than what they use and your transaction will confirm without the added delay the testing introduces.

I know how the passwords are structured. 
I'm hoping after I get some rest, I'll be able to figure out how to use [Revalin's Script]( and make the task of brute forcing less complex by using what I know about the password like pattern, characters used, phrase and character repetition.
Also, fairly certain its 22-26 chars :-/

I bought pass through shares from BTCT.co last week and got them transfered to direct shares way cheaper and faster than going through auctions at bitcointalk this was my first time buying shares for  a bitcoin company. I bought through auction then through btct.co if I had done everything through there I would've saved a btc!
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:06:46
Awesome glad you got it! That makes me feel better hopefully I'm next lol its just insane MtGox is handling things pretty well but holy crap it could be so much better.

I would have saved a little over 1 btc last week by buying everything through btct.co and not using auctions. At auction prices there was a premium.

I think litecoin would not have as much value if it were not for the miners and bitcoin. Most litecoin miners just mine litecoin because its more profitable to mine them then exchange for btc. 
But how do you compare two cryptocurrencies? There is certainly a difference in price between ltc/btc and ltc/usd compared to btc/usd. This is all new territory on the cryptocurrency journey.
Imagine what happens with the influx of GPU miners switching over once btc is no longer profitable.
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:13:03
This is misinformation they cannot "decide where all the new bitcoins belong" Please see 
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:06:32
They were between 2.5 and 2.6 and i paid less than 2.5 even with commission on BTCT.co and Burnside transferred to direct shares for free. I am a happy camper! Wish I bit the bullet earlier though.

Hmmm interesting....but a wire would take a couple of days. Everyone other than me is wrapped up in traditional banking systems and do not own bitcoins or bitcoin related exchange accounts.

With bitinstant i always get mtgox cash seems to be the best, I didn't think about price differences between exchanges. I am verified at mtgox but I think a wire transfer would be too expensive. Dwolla from what I understand will take a few business days.

I tried blockchain.info, it basically just uses bitinstant to transfer usd and automatically purchases BTC for you. 
I much rather use Bitinstant because I would've gained an extra .1-.4 BTC from the market volatility but at the end of the day not a big deal. Was still easy and seamless and eliminated the step of going through MtGox. 
@_date: 2013-07-15 17:39:43
Done. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-07-26 01:35:59
The best  thing to do is  not to sweat it and be completely relaxed. Try to recreate as much about that day as you  can  from seating  position and other factors. Like if you were drunk get drunk again lol
 Keep track  of what you  tried so you dont waste  time trying  it again and narrow it down.
Was it a random password  or one you made up? Good luck my friend good luck.

For months and months if you frequent this reddit you would know that 99% of bitinstant problems come from using it to buy bitcoins **directly** Use it to fund an exchange and then buy BTC. It's the best and fastest way. (probably cheaper too)

The fuck is this? 
Don't get me wrong I like some of your work, but seriously. This doesn't help the community and it just looks like those stupid ebook peddler pages that promises amazing riches if you just buy this $29.99 ebook. 
To say that you knew with certainty is disingenuous because you got lucky. We all see the potential here and we all for the most part have been lucky. Sell your ebook elsewhere.

I must admit I sold at $70.46 and instead of working I'm watching 3 different charts right now.
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:42:57
You are right, but I am not buying and planning out with today's difficulty that would be foolish because of all the ASICs coming to market. I am investing in enough hashing power to still be profitable at a difficulty much higher than today.
If I were to purchase a GPU farm, it will still be profitable TODAY, but more likely than not it would not be worthwhile towards the end of the year. That is what I am trying to say. Your point however is very valid.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:04:52
Wow dude insane in the membrane. Awesome, thanks for sharing!

@_date: 2013-04-26 17:54:05
Well my calculations are based on 10x, 15x, 20x, and 25x the current difficulty. What is put in will be paid for by the ASICs and will be turning a profit even at difficulties much higher than today. 
Could you explain how in this scenario I would be losing money?
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:49:18
Could someone kindly explain what happens when you run out of asks?

I opened a bitfloor account and might try a cash deposit at a bank of america location with localtill as it seems as a really fast method and cheaper than bitinstant. Any experiences with bitfloor?

Mt. Gox used to be an exchange for Magic the Gathering then the owner decided to do bitcoins, then it was bought out by Mark the current owner.

I don't think a 51% attack would be that devastating and even more unlikely as there is not much to gain from it. From the wiki:
 Attacker has a lot of computing power
An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
    Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
    Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
    Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks 
The attacker can't:
    Reverse other people's transactions
    Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
    Change the number of coins generated per block
    Create coins out of thin air
    Send coins that never belonged to him 
It's much more difficult to change historical blocks, and it becomes exponentially more difficult the further back you go. As above, changing historical blocks only allows you to exclude and change the ordering of transactions. It's impossible to change blocks created before the last checkpoint.
Since this attack doesn't permit all that much power over the network, it is expected that no one will attempt it. A profit-seeking person will always gain more by just following the rules, and even someone trying to destroy the system will probably find other attacks more attractive. However, if this attack is successfully executed, it will be difficult or impossible to "untangle" the mess created -- any changes the attacker makes might become permanent.

I discovered bitcoin back in 2011. At the time the person whom I first bought bitcoins from was telling me how he rented a TV studio and invited me to join / help out. 
It was a commute from NJ to NY, but I went at least once a week. After I bought the BTC I got a new job and this was pending so I told them I needed a day during the week off and they agreed.
After a few weeks of doing this they offer me a full time position. I graciously accept since with that position I got to be absolutely submersed in the whole concept and idea. I also got to meet and speak with some CRAZY INTELLEGENT people including Gavin Andreson, the founders of bitpay, and many many many more. Shit we even organized the first ever bitcoin conference in NYC.
Only problem was I was poor and they never paid me. I stayed like a fool because I loved bitcoin and believed in it full-heartedly. I had to start selling my bitcoins to survive. I only got paid twice from them in 5 months of work. I am an asshole. 
Anyways, had they actually paid me I would have never needed to spend my btc out of necessity maybe a few here or there as I do now to support businesses and such. Over 95% of my btc holdings were gone and I was really behind on life. Took me quite some time to catch up. If I still had those coins I could've quit my job and actually attempt to do something meaningful with my life. But no point in fussing over it does feel good to type it out. You live and you learn.
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:57:15
Hold on to them, I wasted lots of money trying to sell high and buy low. It's not worth it usually. Unless you want to take the risk. Of course, its a risk holding on too. I would just hold on and ride it out. That's just my two cents.

Looks like they are unreasonably backed up. Amazing that its nearly as tough to get fiat into btc as it was in 2011. If not I wouldn't have used Mt Gox half the times I have.
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:34:09
Would you be able to include projected difficulty? Awesome doc!
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:12:01
Absolutely, but it comes down to quantity. You need a good quantity so that its still profitable even after the difficulty goes up 10-15x which it should be around 91 million  vs the ~9 million its at now if the all the ASIC companies ship their products.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:23:51
This doesn't guarantee an environment for allowing double spend attacks, it just makes it slightly more likely than normal circumstances. Given how well we handled Fork Monday I think we're in good shape. If you look at how the only double spend attack was carried out on Fork Monday, it required a specially built bitcoind that did not follow of the bitcoin protocol's rules.
