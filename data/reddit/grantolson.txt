I've never been able to buy a new car that costs $20,000 in less time than that. That just happens when you buy expensive things. If you're running an art gallery, break out some campaign and caviar or something while they're waiting to give them the boutique experience and keep the customer happy.

There's no such thing as a git fork. That's just something github made up. It's just a clone where github knows that it's a clone.
Even if he did fork it in github instead of running an independent clone, he could still rebase and force push and do all kinds of stuff to try to sneak in code if he wanted to. You would still need to do the exact same analysis in either case, for example seeing if a release tag matches the right hash and/or is gpg signed, if you were worried about something fishy going on.
And even then he could just still produce signed binaries that had totally different code if he wanted to be nefarious and most people would just run that and not even see the actual code they're running.
TLDR: fork vs clone is irrelevant in terms of software assurance.

Yes you're correct, but as you pointed out that's the *current* fee. The default fee has already been changed and dropped when the price shot up because it was getting too expensive. In theory, miners will eventually compete for business by offering more favorable terms driving the price down, like two gas stations across the street from each other.

It was never said, but I always assumed the reason the official binaries kept going on sourceforge was because that was the only way to keep satoshi as an admin.  Moving everything to github would essentially kick him off the core team, which didn't seem cool even if he wasn't active.

Wrong.  WoT paths are built into gpg.  You need to have one fully trusted path or three marginally trusted paths to the key in question.  But that requires:
1) Actually signing keys first when you trust their authenticity.
2) Specifying the associated trust settings (how well do I trust this person to certify another's key) by running `gpg --update-trustdb`
Yes there are usability issues, but it's all built into gpg.

It's also worth noting that the resulting hash is used to verify the integrity of the contents of the block, in effect signing off (although it's not a cryptographic digital signature).
If, for example, after the fact someone tries to add a new transaction to an old block, or change the amount sent from 1 BTC to 0.1 BTC, the hash will no longer match up, and nodes can tell the block has been tampered with.
So the hashing secures the blockchain two ways:
1. Ensuring that blocks are generated in a distributed fashion so no single entity controls their production.
2. Providing a mechanism to validate that a block hasn't been tampered with after the fact.
It's not just a random problem for randomness' sake.

What is the real problem with PoW?
Since PoW was used by bitcoin for years before people started talking about PoS, and PoS is the proposed superior alternative, I think the burden of proof of proving superiority falls on the PoS advocates.  Why should we stop using PoW and start using PoS?

The 'property' status just deals with regulatory issues and exactly how much you get taxed.  Any time you have a realized gain/loss in wealth, that's taxable.  It might be as income.  It might be as capital gains.  It might be property or it might be currency.  You help someone move and they pay you with pizza and beer, that is technically income.  If you trade a $15 comic book for a $20 comic book that's $5 income.
In that sense, bitcoin might not have the most favorable tax status, but it's not like the IRS made up completely bizarre and unprecedented rules for crypto-currencies.  The basic principle that they get a cut whenever you get wealth has long been established.

I've placed multiple orders, and payment was confirmed as soon as the transaction hit the network.  Didn't even need a single confirmation.  Were you using one of those online wallets that batches up transactions and doesn't send them out instantly? This sounds like one of those "sent coins from Exchange X" problems.

Actually that's a pyramid scheme, which bitcoin also gets confused with.
The defining characteristic of a Ponzi scheme is that dividends are fraudulently paid out to old investors with new investors money, where the source of the 'profit' has just plain been lied about.
When someone buys a bitcoin, there is not direct transformation of this money into 'dividends' or 'profits' that bitcoin early get, and that they believe came from a different source.
Sometimes you'll see Social Security described as a Ponzi Scheme. And although pedantically it isn't, I think that's a much more valid comparison than bitcoin. Most people think when their money goes into the Social Security Trust, it sits there segregated waiting for them like and IRA, and that's not the way social security works at all. But politicians are happy to describe it that way, so arguably they're being fraudulent in describing the source of your ss payments after retirement.
But even if we're being a little loose with the definition of a ponzi, bitcoin doesn't come close.
Now as for a pyramid scheme, the defining characteristic is usually that you pay a kick-back to your higher ups. With bitcoin, there's no direct kickback to higher ups.  If I introduce someone to bitcoin, they don't owe me 10% of their profits for life. That structure just doesn't exist.

No it wasn't an oversight. It was intentional.  It was so that later on, Satoshi couldn't be accused of pre-mining a single block.  He needed to prepare the genesis block in advance, then he released the software, then anyone could mine (even if no one did) which would be fair. That early on, he had already considered that getting an unfair extra 50 BTC via premining would tarnish his reputation and the project.

There are plenty of bets where the payouts on each side are different. For example, in a horse race each horse has different odds based on how likely they are to win. Or a boxing match with Mike Tyson back in the day might have had him heavily favored. Or the best team in the NFL playing the worst team will have an interesting money line.
So in this case, he's just offering 10-to-1 odds. A long-shot in a horse race can easily have worse odds than that.
If someone thinks its 1000 times less likely that you'd hit $1000 before $100, it's still a good bet for that person. If they think it's 5 times less likely, it's probably not. If you think they're equally likely, it's an unfair bet.
The Forbes author clearly doesn't seem to think either outcome is equally likely.

Well there's what I call the **continuity model**. I never got full verification on Gavin's PGP key, but after the tenth release or so where the checksums were signed by him, I felt pretty confident that I hadn't been subject to a multi-year MiTM attack.
When the key switched to Wiadimir's personal key, I got a warning that I didn't have the new key, took a step back and had to look at the mailing lists and stuff to see that he was in fact the new maintainer.
When it switched again to his code signing key, more alarm bells went off and I had to track down an email where he announced the new key and signed the message with his old key.
Similarly, in theory the first time you ssh in to a server and it tells you this is a new key, you're supposed to confirm the fingerprint, but no one does that. In theory, this means that someone could be eavesdropping on you since day one. In practice, it's good enough for most people to get that alert when the key for a given server changes.

Gambling is another example. Satoshi dice used to do everything on the blockchain, even if you bet 1 cent or less, and many people considered that spamming the blockchain. Most gambling sites now have you deposit X bitcoin, then you bet all day, and you win or lose a bunch of bitcoin, but none of that is "on blockchain" until you withdraw your funds. So the network only sees two transactions instead of potentially 100,000s or millions of transactions for people using bots to gamble.

You're selling something for $10. One person pays with a $10 bill. The other pulls out his change jar and starts counting out pennies and nickels and dimes. They both paid the same amount, but one is much easier for you to verify than the other. The same thing happens with bitcoin, where all the small amounts of bitcoin to get to a total of $10 are called inputs.

The system is designed to encourage different groups of people to compete for the mining reward. This is done so that no single entity controls the network and decides to dictate their own rules about what transactions are valid or invalid. You need a system of competition that can't be gamed by the competitors and is fair to everyone. You can't expect everyone to play nice and cooperate and treat each other fairly when we're talking about money. So the system essentially has people buying lottery tickets (generating random hashes) where the winner can't take any sort of systematic approach to beat the system (since hash output is unpredictable by design) and this way you have fair competition.

There is a legal concept called 'standing'. If I live in Utah, I can't sue California for banning gay marriage. Since I don't live in California, I have no standing.
Similarly people can bitch and moan all they want about this, but if you can't find people with standing who feel they've been cheated, robbed, or victimized, then there's no case to be had for anything being wrong here.
So it is a fair concern to ask what your particular standing in this situation is.

Honestly, if you contacted theymos, asked for some accountability and/or refund, and he blew you off, I'd have a completely different opinion on this whole topic.
But every time the situation comes up, a bunch of people get morally outraged, but are unable to find any actual victims in the whole situation. They talk about hypothetical 'donators' (who have some expectation of a contract) or the 'community' (who obviously don't), but they can never come up with a real concrete example of a person who was actually victimized. If there are no victims, moral outrage is pointless.
That's why I think it's important for people who actually donated to speak up if they have a problem with the way the donations have been used. (Or not used.) Until that happens, and I can't see any real victims, it just seems like people pulling a "Please think of the children!" type thing every time this subject comes up.

* When you run bitcoin-qt, or the daemon, you're running a node in the network that transmits the blockchain to other nodes.
* That node has rules programmed in about what blocks it will accept or reject.
* Blocks accepted by a majority of the network are considered good, and that is how consensus is reached.
So a miner could make a node that accepts lower difficulty, mine blocks that meet that criteria, but the rest of the network will simply ignore those blocks. He can't trick them in using the blocks.
You may have heard some discussion about a 'hard fork' if they make the block size bigger which Gavin is pushing for. So basically for that to be a successful change to the rules, 51% of the network would need to be running code that accepts those rules. Ideally more. Right at 50% people could make a case for which network has the 'good' blockchain. But if say 95% of the clients are upgraded, the other 5% essentially become an orphaned island.

As far as I'm concerned, the pass through operators were complicit with the ponzi. They were in a position to make a profit via economic rent because they had hoards of bitcoin that the little people didn't. When you're taking other people's money and investing it for them, you really should do due diligence. The scheme promised 1% returns daily. I don't know why people always want to give the passthrough guys a free pass and say "They were just stupid, not greedy."

Both the Euro and the Swiss Franc are in the teens, and the Ruble is at a whopping 23-24%. Sure 80% is higher, but that demonstrates that we're not talking about a crazy order-of-magnitude difference in volatility in the broad categories of bitcoin vs real currencies.

How did you back up your wallet and files like that? Just because the bitcoin was transferred, it doesn't necessarily mean that your machine got hacked. If someone could get your private keys somewhere else, like for example on dropbox, then they could move the coins without ever touching your PC. Then when you sync with the blockchain you'll see them move.
Bringing this up so you think about other things than your PC getting hacked that may have been the cause of the theft.
