Declining liquidity makes it tough to take $$ --&gt; BTC --&gt; $$ where the beginning and ending $$ amounts are the same, even if hypothetically the two transactions were instantaneous. 
In reality, bitcoin has a cost to produce as a product, just like any other product.  Direct tangible costs include energy and mining equipment.  The manufacturer produces a bitcoin, and in return for the bitcoin trades money that is of higher value.  The profit is flowing up to the tip.  That is the primary market.  You can still make money with well timed trades in the secondary market.

at work with professional communications with clients, we write professionally.  business is business.
online we write shorthand and abbreviate, kthx grammar police...
over bloomberg, msgs between traders are always abbreviated and could be mistaken for the common trollbox if the source wasnt indicated.  even msgs to clients are sometimes abbreviated to an onlooker outstide of the relationship.  however if i were on a research paper or writing market commentary, you bet the writing would be professional and written properly.

A confidence trick (synonyms include confidence scheme and scam) is an attempt to defraud a person or group after first gaining their confidence, in the classical sense of trust. A confidence artist (or con artist) is an individual, operating alone or in concert with others, who exploits characteristics of the human psyche such as dishonesty, honesty, vanity, compassion, credulity, irresponsibility, naïveté, or greed.

I agree.  I want to anonymously purchase a VPN subscription.  The only method for doing this that i know is by using the functionality of the bitcoin network, which means i need the currency.
However purchasing the currency without the intent of taking advantage of the functionality of the network leads to overpricing..... what goes up must come down but i suppose only time will tell.

Doesn't surprise anyone you don't understand.  Based on your post it sounds like you only care about additional merchants and development because it may increase the value of what you've got in cold storage.
Now please go out and sell this to more people.  Remember, attention, interest, decision, action, cold storage. Get off your lazy ass and sell your friends &amp; family on it.  The increase in value will be much more gratifying once you know you've made your contribution to the team effort.  Otherwise you're just a lazy ass bitch that thinks he can get rich without pushing the stuff himself.  Always be closing

Cornering the market
Although there have been many attempts to corner markets by massive purchases in everything from tin to cattle, to date very few of these attempts have ever succeeded; instead, most of these attempted corners have tended to break themselves spontaneously. Indeed, as long ago as 1923, Edwin Lefèvre wrote, "very few of the great corners were profitable to the engineers of them."[2] A cornerer can become vulnerable due to the size of the position, especially if the attempt becomes widely known. If the rest of the market senses weakness, it may resist any attempt to artificially drive the market any further by actively taking opposing positions. If the price starts to move against the cornerer, any attempt by the cornerer to sell would likely cause the price to drop substantially. In such a situation, many other parties could profit from the cornerer's need to unwind the position.

An amazing investment opportunity has just come across my desk and thought I would share it with you. This is an exclusive one time offer for a high growth stock, and has been forecasted to double in the 30 days. It will make back any loses on neo... do I have your attention?
The only caveat is you need to act now because the supply is limited and demand is sky rocketing. I know you would be interested in it based on your previous IPO endeavors and entrepreneurship. The only next step is decision and action. PM now for details

Day over day, the lows are lower and the daily highs are lower.
 is great quickly see price and volume.  Notice that all the up swings are on small volume, and the down is on large volume.... that is a sign of a bearish market.
Don't know about you guys, but I'm going to sit the next couple out until the above trend reverses, and the ups are on  higher volume.  Granted this strategy is essentially waiting for after the reversal is on its way, but I'd rather miss out on a few points from the bottom, than buy into a bearish market to fool myself into thinking i can time the bottom...

to be fair, it has similar characteristics to multi level marketing.  And the only difference between MLM and ponzi is the product.  One of the difficult aspects of creating a new MLM compnay is choosing the right product and demographic.  Assuming bitcoin is a product, bitcoins demographic has generally been the tech community.  The most successful MLM companies choose a customer base that has money.
Although over priced, the amazing knife from that door to door salesmen still has utility.  So does bitcoin.  A cash like mechanism for anonymous internet purchases is greatly valuable.  Buying the product for its intrinsic utility is fine, but believing door to door knife salemenship is the path to the moon usually back fires (unless you are closer to the top of the pyramid).
As an investment, bitcoin is a ponzi scheme.  As a product, bitcoin has utility.  However, just like multi level marketing schemes, buying into btc right now as an investment is equivalent to signing up for the bottom of the pyramid.  Hopefully those that do sign up have the salesmenship and luck necessary to have other sign up under them.
For me, I'll be buying btc in small amounts to renew a VPN subscription.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:17:03
That depends on if you interpret bitcoin as a product or as a currency/commodity.
Not all investments fluctuate in value based on pure supply/demand like commodities, i.e. discounted value of cash flows.  
Bitcoins liquidity makes entering the market and exiting immediately have a real cost.

Don't want to withdraw due to penalties and taxes.  But i can "borrow" up to 50% of it at any given time and the money is direct deposited the next day into checking
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:21:20


so brave
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:45:05
Nah, if you withdraw, then there are taxes and 10% penalty to be paid.  But you can also "borrow" against your 401k.  What this means is that the amount of money borrowed is removed from 401k and will not be invested, and has to be paid back with interest.  However the interest you pay back is paid to yourself and added to your total 401k balance.  
As long as bitcoins yield &gt;~4% annually, then the interest is paid for.  But the problem is that you don't have that borrowed money invested in the 401k.  Since im all in on the S&amp;P, if it declines in 2014, then im good.  If it gains, my BTC gains have to be 4% + S&amp;P gains to break even.  
What do you guys think?

Abstract. The Bitcoin economy exhibits remarkable and predictable stability on the supply side based on the power 
costs of mining. However, that stability is challenged if cost-curve assumption is not solely expressed by the fair cost 
of power. As there is at least one major player, the botnets, that can operate at a power-cost-curve of zero, the result 
is a breach of Gresham's Law: stolen electricity will drive out honest mining. This has unfortunate effects for the 
stability of the Bitcoin economy, and the result is inevitable collapse.
