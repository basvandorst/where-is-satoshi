It will actually make bitcoin more expensive relative to the dollar. If total amoint of usd is going up, and bitcoin supply remains constant or decreasing, then your .5 bitcoin will be able to purchase more dollars over time.

Its been my understanding that faucets in 2017 are getting money to pay out through advertising sales...
Nothing against that, but it k3pt me from actually trying out any bitcoin faucets so far. I tried minergate for some shitcoin mining but i would rather have more btc even if its small amounts from a shitty app.
So, what app/faucet would you reccomend to someone only using a quadcore phone to make the most bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:28:50
Lol... You mean to tell me that first Mad Money was telling people bitcoin is a bubble ready to fall apart... 
Then after they put as much money as they can into it they will tell others to go ahead and start buying now lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:25:47
I went to coinbase because i wanted the largest and most secure/trusted exchange that happens to have a decent app also. 
I didnt want to hand over my bank account to a shady company and get hacked or screwed over, and coinbase had good reviews and seemed to be honest about what they do... High fees for good user interface. Gdax is nice!

Looks like coinhive is already hacked... Googled coinhive just now and it looks like hackers took control of the network at one time to make everyone mine for them... Also another headline was "coinhive now  most used malware on websites"
Hackers basically use coinhive somehow as an in-browser miner that many people dont realize is using their cpu as they browse a webpage. Hacker simply inserts coinhive program into their website or someone elses and profit...
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:23:14

Well Rogers pal, Oldenburg called us a group of bitcoin talaban... Check out the article from yesterday, just another FOMO tactic that BCH used yeasterday right before coinbase opened trading and messed it up lol.
"cofounder of bitcoin.com dumped bitcoin for bitcoin cash"

It could actually go the other way.
South Korea
They are all major military and economic partners and all these countries likely hold the most share of bitcoin. Fact checking myself...

I first bought in $100 at $9100, worrying that it would dip and i should wait lol... Got more around 9500 and 10500. Now im just missing out on litecoin and waiting for money to transfer.

My grandpa is big into stocks; Pepsico, 3M, Altria(big tobacco), auto parts stocks. He taught me about compounding interest, dividends and other stuff. 
Over thanksgiving my cousin in college was talking about bitcoin and the price going up %1000. Well my grandpa didnt really have an opinion and probably doesnt understand btc well. My uncle said its a ponzi scheme and i agreed with him... While thinking about how the USD is a ponzi scheme in a way and we are probably early into the bitcoin craze. 
Now im in .0255 Btc and .28 ltc because i feel like we have a long way untill the top!

I missed out on some 160$ litecoin... Oh well its at 260 now... Maybe it will drop again today and then coinbase will screw me out of a buy im guessing.
Market available fairly to everyone my ass... Coinbase is showing that they are just money hungry and will not show the truth about who is manipulatinf markets because i bet its their own bots and pump and dump schemes..

I may have created a misunderstanding. The regular monthly purchases would be my own responsibility, i dont know if they have deposit options like that.
If your bank account is already linked go to Deposit and select transfer (ach) from bank account to gdax and your all set. They have been busy, took 7 days to have my money deposited, but for peace of mind it only took me 2 days to transfer money out of gdax to my bank.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:37:09

Good one! Reminds us of what we are all trying to achieve with bitcoin. An end to slavery and control by the Federal Reserve and other central banks who srew us with fractional reserve banking and money inflation. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:17:10
Just research the difference between market orders and limit orders. Im used to stocks, but it works that a market order ussually does not go through at the price you are hoping for because your getting matched up with a transaction selling for a higher price than you want to buy for...
So market orders will ussually be slightly above current prices, and gdax charges like .25% fee on market orders i believe. 
So to save money and get a specific price set up a Limit order whether you are buying or selling. You place the amount and the price you want to buy or sell at and the order doesnt go through unless you hit that specific price you asked for!
Technically you should always use limit orders if you want to be smart, but its not always possible. I believe gdax bitcoin has a minimum of 100$ for a limit order buy...
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:15:13

Its misleading, they are mining XMR (Monero) by using coinhive as a network pool or botnet.
Coinhive lets you mine users cpu that visit a webpage with their embedded program. So most users have no clue someone is hijacking their device to make small fractions of a cent from tons of users.

My first market order buy of Bitcoin was $100 worth when it was just breaking $9000.
Put my Market Order buy in at like $9035 and my actual buy price turned out to be around $9120.
I learned my lesson, market orders are ussually a few cents off for company stock, but coinbase crypto gets to rape you with market buy differences, along with high fees, shity support, crashing multiple times, and not listening to their customers.
Oh i didnt mention the btrash fiasco and possible insider trading.

Yeah... Bought bitcoin with the fee on debit card, went through right away and i was pissed about fees eating away at my money.
But then i have made back my fees plus %10-%20 on top of that, and here i am waiting until next tuesday to Hopefully get an 87$ transfer placed in my account, a total of 10 days waiting time...
I used to own stocks with Robinhood, much faster transaction processing even when they were adopting many new users. I think the banks put maximum time on anything bitcoin related because they are just jealous haters and think it could be illegal activity or whatnot.

@_date: 2017-11-30 22:22:52
Ok ok... Maybe i dipped into my check a tiny bit more... 0.036 Bitcoin total. But i agree you should have more to maximize potential. 
At first i put 90$ into LTC but exchanged it for bitcoin. Also have 87$ transfer that will take a few more days for a total 10 day ACH transfer...
And i will dollar cost average by buying in monthly with a cash fund in gdax for dips planned.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:13:24
Yep buy small amounts regularly like monthly or quarterly, buying the dip within a weeks perior is ussually good enough for me.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:47:04
Yesterday bought a little bitcoin, less etherium and waiting to see if the price drops on litecoin.
Using coinbase app and made up the $4 for a 100$ bitcoin purchase within a few hours. Plan on saving it for months or years and using gdax in the future for monthly investments in crypto.
Ive messed around in Robinhood stocks early 2016 and made a good chunk buying 4 Boing stocks when they had a lot of bad news and a price drop to 108$ and 120$. Normally i always limit order, but with the thanksgiving craze im glad that i made a 150$ gamble into bitcoin and ether.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:47:12
Newb, i kinda understand forking, but how does current ownership mean we have more value than ~9900?

Do they accept bitcoin yet? Still waiting to cash out on some big macs...
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:51:02
Better yet use coinbase own online trading gdax to do a regular monthly transfer from your bank account and wait for the money. 
Watch the price and spend your incoming transfer either right away or let it build up and buy when there is a correction.
Personally i probably wont buy dips i will focus on adding a regular monthly amount and get more BTC ASAP because when i wait for a dip, markets tend to bull run.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:02:05
Gdax is run by coinbase... They have a phone app that i used to get $100 worth of BTC bought with a debit card. 
The fees were close to $4 and they take that out of the purchase amount, so i had $96 worth of bitcoin in my account right away.
Sure the fees are a bitch, but i bought in right when i made up my mind and created a coinbase account when it was at $9100 
literally in the middle of the night i was bored and thinking of how ive wanted to get back into investing, and also pondering Thanksgiving conversations about bitcoin.
So i made back the %4 fee with a slight jump we had up to whatever my .01 bitcoin is lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:05:03
Lol i have chase and at least they havnt cut me off yet! Even took only 1 business day to aprove my bank transfer, just waiting on the ACH system.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:56:16
Ok... So 1 BTC now does not include the others right?
But your saying there will likely be more forks or added value over time?

I get that a lot lol! Hey, i was thinking about my future investment and was wondering if you recommend GDAX over coinbase. Got 100$ worth and the fees did not make me happy. 
I have mostly just messed with Robinhood app for stocks. Sold around $1000 in Pepsico stock that was a gift from 5 years before. Invested maybe 400 in Boeing when it tanked on bad news in Feb 2016 and over a few months bought various mid-cap defence and industrial stocks Oshkosh, Triumph, RTN, Huntington Ingals...
Now im trying to invest again with maybe more bitcoin or some ethereum after a week or two maybe. Fees really eat into my gains and while i try to go long, i like flexibility and dont want to waste money on coinbase fees.

I messed around in a few stocks, sold out at like 30% profit and waited to buy the dip... A year and a half later i realize i would have had profits close to %100 if i stayed long in stocks and i kept telling myself sure there will be a big dip in stocks soon! 
Crypto is exciting right now because there is so mucj new attention being spread about bitcoin. There are ups and downs but we are far from the top!

I havnt slept much since investing my first 100$ into BTC. Its exciting! 
4:45am $9960 Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:09:34
How much bitcoin will you pay me to eat my balls?
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:17:55
I hope it crashes 50%
I need time to catch up!
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:39:10
I was waiting all day for it to go up from the 9750 range and within no time at all i check and its at 9850... Glad to have gotten some BTC before hitting 10K 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:22:49
I hope some day the USD will not be needed anymore and i will get paid in bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:46:15
Right i could never be so regular and non compulsive like that... He is lying 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:40:02
My bitcoin! Give me!
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:47:00
I almost want to cash out just like 50$ out of my 250$ just to buy in on a dip and increase my BTC holdings...
But im worried about loosing out if it suddenly rises after i cash out.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:46:57
Then its on to coin 2... And global domination!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:10:30
Wait untill it reaches $11000 within 24 hours!

Just messing with ya! I just started my coinbase account Saturday and got my first bitcoin so im excited to be part of the community and continually watch it.
With stocks theres always research to do, comparisons to be made and P/E evaluations, earnings, buying and selling into different industries. Now that im into bitcoin i miss that competitive research but i also like the fact that bitcoin has a majority share of crypto market.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:05:11
We will see. I want to have most of my investment in Bitcoin and im currently trying to decide if ethereum or litecoin are worth holding onto at all...
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:42:18
Welcome to the club!
You got in before 10K, lets see where we are in a year!
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:31:39
Bitcoin will make USD powerless... After i buy in over a few years...
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:14:44
What crash? I think the amount of new people wanting bitcoin will exceed those trying to cash out for quite some time... 
I accept that we are in a bubble, but that is the nature of economics and i still believe there are greater fools out there who will drive the price up steadily.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:00:54
Lol makes sense. Its strange because i was into the ideas of bitcoin back in 2010 and 2011, supported the idea that central banks are a central problem and even invested hundreds in gold and silver... 
But i missed out on buying any bitcoin then. Good luck and may your investments grow!
Just watched the Bitcoin movie on netflix not bad...
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:30:11
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:48:33
Out of curiosity what other coins are you interested in? With just a few hundred im all into bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:45:55
Keep it up! I just started and have 0.02 BTC
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:21:54
Thats the key, Dont Sell!
My grandpa had stocks from the 90s and always had investment talks with us... He gifted me 10 stocks of Pepsico when it was like 60$ a share, i sold when it was ~105$ a share and bought 4 stocks Boeing average 120$.
My gramps is in Altria, ive thought they are undervalued recently... Also 3M, pepsico, US treasuries, and an auto parts stock. Basic necesities that never go away!
Just got an account with GDAX so i can limit order and no more fees!
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:59:43
The end of other people controlling your money!
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:36:15
Smart. Im here with $200 worth seeing how much i can buy monthly before the big investors and numbers of average people go up and jack the price up...
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:27:15
I see resistance at 9,800 followed by a breakthrough another 700-800$ 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:37:47
Botcoin! The new crypto king when the AI takes over!
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:40:59
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:33:56
That makes sense. I am used to limit orders on robinhood to get a specific price always. Think i will set up an account on there to get my real crypto-investment going.
 When i recieved pepsico stock i was trying to buy more stock and diversify and thats what made me turn to Robinhood because of no fees and the ease of buying and selling at whatever specific price i wanted.
Im planning a long term crypto-savings that i add maybe 50-100$ per month into mainly like %85 Bitcoin, maybe %15 ether. Im not in any stocks right now, i might pick some up after doing research again...
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:44:52
I thought it was bad watching my stocks on Robinhood... 
Perhaps being all in on bitcoin and few serious contenders in my mind, just increases that obsession with knowing what the price rate of change is.  Obsessing about the future single line that could always go up or down.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:37:32
Keep it up! I get jeleous when i see how others with X many bitcoin... Then i remember its more about creating my own personal savings and feeling like my money from working hard has a store of value more protected from inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:03:13
So close!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:48:12
Yes zero forgotten, although it would have been a good buy oportunity. Just saw that we hit 10900 amd diped back down to 10300 and was bought up again! Going to be a fun ride!
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:29:27
Better chance for me to see how much of my paycheck i will part with...
I was paying 145$ monthly for health insurance. Cancelled that and i figure now with my small raise i can easily afford dropping $100 a month regularly to see if i can get some compounding action going on.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:22:01
Gives me that bitcoin! Worth less than two pennies now but you will see lol... Im a new crypto investor now too, starting off with 0.02 BTC. Used to stocks on robinhood and i can totally see bitcoin making big gains over a year and longer, the interest will compound with the news that it has gone up 1000 percent this year!
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:57:57
I just bought $100 worth!
Over thanksgiving...
My Cousin: "My friends at college are talking about bitcoin going up 10X..."
My Uncle: "Thats just a pyramid scheme right Storm?"
Me: " Yeah its a ponzi scheme!"
Me after doing some quick research... Buy Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:12:53
I did like their website, i can see it as a more transaction friendly crypto.
