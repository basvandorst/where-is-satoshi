Can I say both?

Well, I have a few employees on the regular, and independent contractors. I needs something on a regular basis, that;s easy to use, and easy for them to use.

I want it to be a universal wallet to get any product, service, delivery, transportation service. I like using Bitcoin since it's first and immutable, and has the network strength.

I guess it depends on what economic school you subscribe to and your personal fiscal ethic. I personally dislike debt, and watching other uncontrolled power diluting what I have worked hard for. And yes, we are lucky we live in a country like the US, where it's not nearly as bad as other countries.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:42:01
Let's build this team. Let's put together a list and community of developers and members that can build this together.

Ikr. 560 mm is half a bn. To me that's insane inflation, and it's nothing compared to all the other crap going on regarding debt obligations, QE, and in the other countries. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:15:57
Ok. I am new to Bitcoin. But I fucking love it. Now like you all say the fees are high and it's not social/scalable. I can help with that with all your guy's help. I've been working on an app called Lightning for almost 5 years now, and it's a services app clone of Uber, here it is  I would like it to be a wallet now with layer for BTC transactions. Could I get the talent to rally on this? I don want just a community andwant you all to get involved, invest, and develop.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:36:17
It seems, at least, it will push it much higher. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:05:41
People aren't comfortable with it seems and it's not mainstream or friendly. I want to help with this. I am the founder of a lightning app, that's somewhat similar, and I know I can help if I had the right connections and team.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:44:03
It makes me upset. I recently discovered Bitcoin, and it is satisfying to invest in it. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:54:50
Haha, I'd rather talk European football than American football. Americans we need to find ways to make us look macho, like guys in helmets ramming into each other. But I just took that to a new level how I view my culture here. Crypto finally actually let's me talk "cool" with the boys...
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:22:38
When will Lightning be working?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:52:37
there's been enormous change in a couple weeks
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:10
It sounds like a scam.

I'm not a developer. How do I get this to work without know code?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:22:54
I looked at ETH but can't they simply issue more of that coin whenever they want? What's to keep that from growing in price?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:48:15
good point! lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:53:16
I do believe in it. :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:45
What is going on on Gdax for Bcash, anybody really know? Is this insider manipulation, stacking the books and pump and dump?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:22:06
What would cause this other than say a country banning it?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:47:28
Going from a stock trading fund to bank to an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:14:50
That's kinda scary isn't it? Is this the direction we want to go? Or is this a step back?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:52:36
Couldn't this spell the demise of all digital coin in the long run, or at least deflate it's value?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:24:08
It truly is revolutionary. I am very much sold on it. But there are major bottlenecks and issues. It's scary to be honest. Plus, I hear speculation about a faster cheaper lightning* network and merchants accepting digital coin, but I would like to see it in action. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:49:34
Hopefully we will have a solution soon!
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:15:23
How long are wire transfers taking to get to Gdax right now?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:08:43
so when that happens doesn't that inflate it and thus cause it to be worth less?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:43:41
best way to contact them about this?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:51:58
shit. at least you got in at a good time
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:32:29
ive already don it and no really transparency bitch
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:17:19
Was kinda hoping it would've during the process of getting involved. If it does I would like to buy more. Should I wait or dollar cost average in?

Hah ikr. Fuck Sachs, Dimon, Buffet, and the old school. Out with the old, in with the new!

I'm an employer. Unfortunately my employees probably wouldn't be keen on being paid in it yet unless I did a daily immediate pay option in Bitcoin. I kinda see that happening in payroll improvement vs. the weekly or two week pay.

"unfettered by political whims."
I am starting to see governments a lot like religion. I was going to be a priest and then I realized how much religion controls people; now I am non religious. I got married and realized how much a person can try and control you; now I am divorced. Money is the new area of liberation for me. I am tired of being controlled by other people.

Haha I want to get fat with coinage!

Snagged me another coin. Thanks for the pullback guys.

Dude, that's the scale I have, and Im grinding those pounds off. I'm using the app Lose It and tracking what I eat keeping my daily caloric budget down and also exercising an hour every day. It's working great as I've lost almost 12 lbs in a month

A lot of that was from a server in Ashburn Virginia. Anyone know who?
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:06:23
I've been saying it all along. He will be the one that will make this all happen. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:30:14
Makes you wonder why a few hands control so much fiscally.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:54:26
This is weird and artificial. Anyone know what the fuck is going on with BCH? 
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:38:47
Yes but what about freedom from government?
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:14:33
Bought me another coin. Thanks guys for the pull back! :)

Can we see the chain of the new Bitcoins being mined?
@_date: 2019-02-01 16:15:27
Yes! That's a documentary though. This will be fictional.

So when I spend a part of a Bitcoin am I giving bits of a code to another person essentially?

So what lends more credibility then?

If you don’t accept it we are going to war?

Insightful. Who’s the biggest kid right now and how’s it going down?
@_date: 2019-12-04 05:57:13
Can you explain this?
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:01:01
Not that there is anything fundamentally wrong with that. But what if after millennia there's only 100 Bitcoin still in access?
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:23:23
I just think we are going to see run away debt and inflation, not necessarily complete bankruptcy or sovereign default. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:15:49
The initial investment is...
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:24:24
We will diversify her portfolio but feel the most attractive investment is Bitcoin at the moment and a minimum balance in a savings account 
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:12:01
We will. Thanks 
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:44:28
We will diversify of course, as we make further installments. But hoping this will be the most promising.
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:31:59
I think it would be awesome if she is a millionaire by the time she's 18
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:56:17
And stocks are?
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:22:51
I agree with you. I believe most taxes are exorbatant and then wasteful. Hence decentralization
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:13:51
I wish I knew about it then!
@_date: 2019-01-12 03:08:35
That needs to change
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:09:57
No that's perhaps the least of all reasons
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:38:40
I see it as a gradual decline and shift to stronger assets and currencies.
@_date: 2019-01-12 03:08:12
Well that's stupid 
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:09:18
1.3 trillion spending bill signed. Gross. Buying more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:02:34
Do you have a list of tax havens? Also this would require being a citizen correct? What are the crypto friendly countries?
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:23:50
This is precisely why I think people need to be open to selling real estate and large assets for crypto, especially Bitcoin.

My company is even stronger and healthier without debt. I truly believe it's kinda of a sickness to think that debt is a good thing. I can understand it being used as a tool but we use it as the norm.
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:57:10
what professional advice exactly, and who would you get that from?
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:36:53
I would, but I think stocks are grossly overvalued, and there is a salient historic event and opportunity occurring with the way we transact fiscally.
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:05:02
I agree with you, and would like to offer this pure form of payment. Is there any tools I can use for the website? Or just post a receiver address for Bitcoin? Also when will LN network have easy to embed tools?
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:02:38
Already have been. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:11:38
I invest in my company and it is growing. But I also don't want it to, nor could it grow forever. That's another thing. Companies can't just grow forever. We think they can and the can't. Eventually your money is best invested elsewhere. That's why I invest in other things as well like property and Bitcoin. Why would I take on debt and pay interest if I don't need to? I understand not all are bad but debt isn't necessarily good.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:24:26
I don't have debt and I continue to work. You don't need debt as a reason for existing.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:24:06
Well, obviously buy your basic necessities first, and then if your saving buy Bitcoin or property is great too like you say. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:59:41
That's what makes it great though, it is censoreless, and free from government. Governments can't do anything about it, because it will go on no matter what. 
Think about it like this if you had lived in Venezuela or India recently and had been buying Bitcoin, you would've been safe from the inflation in Venezuela or India's invalidation of large bank notes.
I get that we are talking about the USA here, and much of the world markets are based on the USD, but that is changing. And if we continue to run amok I don't think it's going to be some apocalypse because we are still doing pretty good, but it's going to be metrics like rising inflation and devaluation of the dollar.
Thus, it is smarter to be in a currency or store of wealth immune from these forces.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:32:01
Why do we call it crypto? Why don't we start calling it something else like digital currency?
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:31:26
You sound like your brain is a turd.
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:09:10
I dunno, the fact that it's probably the future of money...
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:47:21
I understand where you're coming from and your argument. But I'm saying it's better to be without debt if you don't need it. I started my own business without debt. I bought a house and don't owe a mortgage and barely had to put anything on debt. I rarely see the advantage of taking on debt. I also prefer to stay away from stocks. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:07:49
I'm hoping she won't have to sell
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:14:03
More reasons to buy Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:56:24
Why gold when Bitcoin is better?
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:05:32
It's not shilling. We have a strong economy, why are we increasing the deficit and not paying it off?
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:21:43
I agree with the first statement, and that is my second main investment - first being my business, second, commercial real estate, third is Bitcoin and some crypto. I strongly believe Bitcoin is a store of wealth and foundation for future money. Owning Bitcoin in some ways is more efficient than the former two investments.
@_date: 2018-07-10 23:13:40
Are you being honest ;)?
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:01:44
I'm hoping we are making a smart investment in her. So that when we are old she can maybe consider looking out for us! Not that we aren't investing either. ;)
@_date: 2018-07-09 21:23:57
One of our tech's first name; using Square appointments. I really really want square to make it so we can accept Bitcoin and crypto with a swipe
Edit: crap I see it now...damn. Should I remove the post or is there a way to edit it?

What do you think will be the consequence? This is spot on by the way.

I'm all for competition!
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:19:41
How do I setup a node? I am already doing my part and am accepting Bitcoin payments. LN seems to be talked about but how do I incorporate it with our services and payments?
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:18:50
Fuck that
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:03:08
This is the kind of shit that's going to make Bitcoin mainstream
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:48:39
The question I have is how can we use this technology to create a truly democratic world without borders perhaps even based on AI and not human voting?
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:17:17
This is how we get adoption! This is why you won't have to sell your Bitcoin ever.

Something we did for our daughter's tax credit was invest it in Bitcoin. Hopefully when she is 18 it will be worth much more.
