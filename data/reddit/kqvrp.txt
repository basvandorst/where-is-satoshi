Well then, you better run from Bitcoin now. The US Gov can buy as much of the currency as they want (at fair market rates) and has already "stolen" a fair bit of it (the SilkRoad bust).
I'm pretty sure that half of the community will not decide to fork to a new currency just because MtGox got their coins stolen by the US.gov

You don't need a degree in computer security. You need to be paranoid and not quickly switch to the latest and greatest thing.
Sadly, the sort of people who use Bitcoin are usually early adopters in general, and they're also quick to adopt new technologies in Bitcoin in particular.

No, that's why he should have transferred them to a _real_ Bitcoin client (bitcoin-qt, electrum, etc) and not left them in the hands of someone else.

That's not true. There's no reason secure banks couldn't be built on top of Bitcoin (using multisig transactions, for example). Heck, with smart contracts, you could even agree to allow them to loan your Bitcoins temporarily.
But you're right, MtGox was emphatically _not_ a Bitcoin bank.

Kinda. FDIC insurance theoretically puts the full faith and credit of the US behind every depositor's account. In practice, like all insurance, they could not afford to honor it if everyone used it at once. The point of FDIC insurance isn't to literally pay you if a bank fails (although they need to create the sentiment that they will), it's to prevent bank runs.

Hmm, using Firefox on Linux with Click2Play activated and NoScript... I'll click whatever I want!
Also, my bitcoins are not on my web browsing machine.

Well, we don't know that he can. It is possible that MtGox's story holds up and they were stolen by an outside attacker. Or maybe someone inside of MtGox stole them.
But you're right, Bitcoin is very unforgiving. If people just thought about Bitcoin like they do cash, they'd be far more careful.

I doubt most people in the community would be shocked. Everyone has known since early on that US.gov isn't going to like Bitcoin. Look at what they did to LR and eGold. Bitcoin is far more censorship-resistent than those methods of payment, but centralized exchanges are not.
We were talking about this before Bitcoin even hit a dollar. The expectation was that, because it is far easier to build a centralized service, centralized exchanges would come first. When they started to get shut down, someone would go to the trouble of building a decentralized (likely on-blockchain) exchange, or things like  and localbitcoins.com would take over for exchanges.
Of course, centralized and trusted exchanges have a great benefit in ease of use over those services, but there's always a cost in decentralizing.

Hey, I'm sure you got an answer to this already, but think of online wallets like keeping your money in a duffel bag in someone else's house. If you want it to be really secure, you need to keep it in a vault in your own house. So use paper wallets or something like Bitcoin-qt or Electrum (with a passphrase). Make sure to make copious backups, and don't lose your passphrase!
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:07:21
I'm way less trustworthy of that, because it seems likely I'd forget the password and/or lose the paper.

Nope. They own any BTC you keep there just as much as they own any dollars you keep there.

Who cares about GUI changes in the reference client? If that's what you want, use Armory or Electrum. The reference client is all about security, stability, and performance, and they've been making strides there.
To be honest, I don't think WxWidgets bitcoin or Qt bitcoin should be part of the reference client. They should just be frontends to the RPC. But Satoshi's first client was GUI all the way (didn't even have RPC at release), and that's the legacy we're dealing with.
