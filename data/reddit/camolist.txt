maybe you should...idk read the sites terms before using it?
seems pretty straight forward.....high yes...i wouldn't use it...but you can't say they dont tell you about the fees

hoping last.fm sees that thread. information and posts look good with links to bitpay and explanations :) as i posted on there would for sure re subscribe (past subscriber) if available for bitcoin

330 here. awesome to see more local-ish activity happening in the bitcoin world

 I'll take you up on that. see the pastebin for a signed message...reddit deforms the text had to upload there
2btc  $100 to care.org. get the remaining 3btc and i'll donate the remaining ~$85 value to a second charity tbd (going to look through comments for ideas).

about the no fees: btc at the moment is right at $22. a $20 ATT contract coupon is "To purchase, please send 1.0465 BTC to:" 
so fee or conversion rate is off a bit?
seems to be a fee as your site has "1 BTC = $21.978" which would make the $20 coupon $23

"your message has been delivered"
screen caps of $100 to care.org included. going to look through comments for where the rest of the 5btc value gets donated to. and after waking up and being able to make full thoughts will write both charities about bitcoin

replied from my account that's purchased thousands of dollars in domains and renewals saying i'd like to see it. hopefully that helps encourage a bit.

awesome! thank you for doing this! sent the remaining $91 value onto charitywater.org. now to write emails to them and care.org about bitcoin! hopefully they consider it

how about archive.org. if i donate $100 using btc do i get 5 btc back? :D
it could fall under education?
I don't know you though. are you on OTC or bitcointalk with a decent history? here's me  (i could sign a message to prove that) so would need reassured this is legit. far to many scams in btc.
if archive.org is not acceptable i'd look for another i guess.
edit: and for the record. i'd end up donating the coinbase sale price of the entire 5btc. not here to make money.

got my February issue. glad things are improving :) keep up the good work
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:25:34
no look at the link it is not to bitcoin's sourceforge page
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:14:53
we're over....subscribed...waiting for crash back down to 10,000
@_date: 2013-03-01 18:17:23
20% increased difficulty. value from 13 to 35 in 2 months. i think many are fine with 20% less...... wait till the difficulty is up a few multiples of its current

good job using the "search reddit box" before posting ;)

still waiting for January's issue (ordered January 3rd) it's a few days away from February. wouldn't the January issue of most other publications be available for immediate delivery in December? shipping needs to improve now.
