Ya, they both have the same function but I chose the cheaper one

Care to share your story?

If I use the OTG adapter with Mycelium will it sync automatically if new transcations happen and my bitcoin wallet increase or decreases? or will I have to replug it in each time to see my amount on my phone?
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:50:42
Oh mycelium I backed it up once if I receive or lessen my bitcoin it will sync correct?

On android there's an invite button

No SSL Https and you want us to put in secure information? I suggest you get Let's Encrypt ssl certificate so data is secure when inputting plus it free!

Might take sometime but its worth it.

What do you mean where it says clip? Mine had a part that said Fold when I cut the usb out and I fold it. It gave a little bit of weight to it but its still loose.

Nice but a smart decision would be to put a third of your assets in BTC for insurance.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:43:18
Thats where you buy yours but how do you get the money to get your bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:57:50
Interesting so you get paid 3% in bitcoin why not more?
@_date: 2016-01-11 10:30:23


Ya for more than twice the money.

Theres always that odd chance that Cryptsy will turn out fine and not like Mt.Gox, and somehow OP won't lose anything but time.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:56:17
So do you get paid by a company or do freelance?
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:42:32
Yes but how do you get your "money." Obviously we don't all do the same stuff.
@_date: 2016-01-04 22:16:36
I guess it was a mistake from French to English translation.
@_date: 2016-01-04 21:15:27
It really is nice. The only problem I see is that its loose when I put it in the USB slot. I guess thats the difference between the nano and the hw.1
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:57:28
So do you get paid in your countries currency and then go buy them at Gemini.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:56:02
No really, what a shocker. But who do you earn yours.
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:56:18
Purse.io asked for bank info, I would go with Circle.
@_date: 2016-02-03 12:46:09
Becareful of phishing sites.

I have a mycelium edition, I love it.

That was more than 1 piece of gold at the time.

I currently use [BitX]( but I really want to try [Darkwallet]( but until there is an android app and a extension for Firefox, I'll have to wait. I'm trying to find an anonymous privacy-oriented bitcoin wallet
@_date: 2015-10-11 01:38:28
Tried it too
@_date: 2016-05-11 10:16:49
This happened to me, I emailed them and they said one of my items I ordered was out of stock and Amazon cancelled my order but Purse didn't even know until they manually checked. They really need to update themselves more on orders.
@_date: 2015-10-11 00:51:42
You have one of those? Do you use bitcoin like everyday?
@_date: 2015-10-11 01:37:56
Try darkwallet
@_date: 2015-10-10 23:37:26
How do you make a sticker like this
