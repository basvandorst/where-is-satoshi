you guys fighting where to drive to while thousands of other devs are each building spaceships to the moon.

# Open source is meant to be reused!!!!
Litecoin is implementing SegWit and LN! Are they scams or copycats? NO
LibreOffice is a fork of Open Office, the later is now abandoned yet the project still lives.. as a fork.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:13:56
Option 1: 
On the technical aspect, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is closer to being Bitcoin, to use the extra on chain space you don't need to do anything.
To use all the new Bitcoin (BTC)  features you need to move all your funds to some kind of new address, so I conclude _cash is the true Bitcoin _
Option 2:
Bitcoin holds the name and implemented new features, they also hold the most hashrate and the same dev team, so I conclude _Bitcoin is the true Bitcoin _
Option 3:
You realize there's no such thing as "The true Bitcoin" so you invest in both thinking both approaches are worth a shot! You choose right and get a free lambo.
The Problem is people dumping all their BCH in BTC and the opposite, yes I get you're showing you believe in (fork), but you now _need_ that side to win!
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:59:01
Spot on, seriously, this isn't about who's the "True Bitcoin" or how bit the block size is, it is about who brings real _value_ to my business/life when I use it and at its current pace Bitcoin is not great.

Ethereum did, the current main chain is a fork
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:25:58
Not really, LN is best when many people use it already, it needs the "network effect" same as when you try to kickstart a social network.. the rate of people joining needs to be greater than the people leaving/stop using it. 
LN needs to hit critical mass so everyone starts using it before it actually becomes useful.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:29:09
I disagree, ETH already manages 1Million transactions per day, pretty scalable IMO. Bitcoin needs to hurry up or it's gonna be too late
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:04:46


is Bitcoin a business? No
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:05:59
To be fair, as a (xmr) pool owner, moving to a different codebase is my worst nightmare even though I deal with almost no money. I can't imagine what a task it would be to upgrade fucking coinbase levels of code. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:30:16
Bitcoin is famous and the average joe hasn't heard of anything else
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:24:36
Lol $3? For 1 Million transactions is freaking great, Bitcoin is dying at a fraction of that. Plus Sharding and Raiden are almost ready 
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:50:04
Honestly, it seems he IS succeeding. Why can a single guy/exchange do so much damage?
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:58:55
This is what worries me, if Bitcoin is so weak **1** guy can cripple its network and deceive so many people, then it would mean Bitcoin is dead the moment some bigger entity attacks.
Instead, I believe Bitcoin is much bigger than that, so big that the whole world is now using it and that makes its network cripple. I also hope Core delivers soon enough.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:27:31
_Current_ LTC fees are $0.50.. damn high considering Bitcoin was under $1k
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:43:04
They aren't feasible eternally but _temporarily_, it would be strategical to increase the block size while other solutions aren't ready.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:20:46
Yep! Doge just hit ATH a few days ago!
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:46:50
Well, fair point.. +1
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:58:34
Yeah, as an user I don't like this either, as a business opportunity.. I see potential (LN channel as a service)
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:30:34
Damn, gave up on buying at $0.22.. something got my mind and never did it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:25:23
I just don't understand why can't we do a _temporary_ size increase. I agree on chain isn't forever but damn fees were $100 today! That's minimum salary over here (Guatemala). The size would go back to sub 1MB once the tech is ready. (This would also kill BCH as extra space is the only advantage)
I also think Bitcoin needs to hurry up or it's user base is gonna bleed too much to other coins. Just think about it, if Bitcoin launched today, it would be garbage vs alts. Only 6 transactions per second, no smart contracts (ETH) and no privacy (XMR) and its mining algorithm isn't ASIC resistant. We need solutions now! Two years is too much.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:18:54
Yeah, they should've increased block size 2years ago and we'd have a single Bitcoin chain today.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:43:52
It _is_ a product. You may not think like it but investors and governments do. What does Bitcoin do that we can't do ourselves by other means? Economical freedom, international payments, trust less payments.. cool! But wait! Monero does that too! And does it all privately!
But, wait! Maybe i don't care too much about privacy, but I want smart contracts! Ethereum does that
Both do it a fraction of the cost, at more than double the speed, with more advanced features... So why should I choose Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:41:57
I see. What I meant was, that if Core had added some extra on chain space two years ago, we wouldn't have BCH today 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:22:34
Finally! Yeah why is so hard to agree on a _temporary_ increase without being called a shill??
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:52:32
Well, that on itself would mean they are stronger than Bitcoin since (according to this sub) a single guy is attacking the network and is succeeding.
Based on what do you say those networks can be easily attacked? Sources? Why would they be destroyed? Ethereum [already manages around a million transactions per day]( which is about 12-13 per second. Bitcoin is up to 6... at $100 fee
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:40:28
Yeah they validate blocks except every node has to do it for its own integrity is not like someone validates for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:41:02
If Bitcoin or any crypto currency is gonna be any useful, it _has_ to compete against centralized solutions like visa.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:36:54
It's funny because the real cash grab is Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Diamond and all those crap forks.. BCH is hated because it's an actual competitor.  
Even better, if BTC increased block size BCH would have no market, but people are so much against block increases nobody suggests it anymore 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:38:49
Eternal on-chain scaling is stupid, yes. But a temporary increase to reduce fees is _strategical_. Instead, the problem has existed for two years and it has simply been ignored. 
Yes we got SegWit now but you still need to move your funds to a SegWit address, paying a fee which is exactly what people don't want. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:14:14
Money is money, I'd be happy 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:13:50
Yeah, I referred to Ethereum. I'll edit to make it clear
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:20:35
Yeah man, holding my whole Dollar worth of Bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:46:01
Oh shit! When's the ICO? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:54:10
Exactly! I propose BTC increases the block size temporarily until the better solutions are ready for deployment.
If the block size was increased 2 years ago we would have no BCH and altcoins wouldn't have taken so much market share.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:32:51
Nobody knows the future, this _may_ be the dip... or not

@_date: 2017-12-22 20:50:50
Boom! Came to say this! Oh look at my new coin! Block time is 10minutes, algorithm is ASIC mineable, no smart contracts and no blockchain privacy! Oh and it supports up to 6 transactions per second!
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:38:36
Because you need to transfer your funds to a SegWit address. Tell me how I can move my $50 without losing most of it -_-
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:26:29
No.. what? If Bitcoin had more space _on chain_ there wouldn't be a reason for BCH to exist
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:33:01
Oh man. Sorry!! I mean, so much nonsense over Bitcoin. I know Ether is massive. All over some stupid block size
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:45:19
If you have the private keys I think you can recover them 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:34:09
Yeah.. _who knew we'd need more space?_
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:19:21
Temporal block increase anyone? Everyone would happily move to SegWit if it didn't cost $15
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:22:07
As the laws of free market dictate, everything is cheaper or can't work. Here we can get the bigger McDonald's fries and drink for what would be a Quarter of a dollar, instead of $1.
ISPs have "internet packs" which are like $1 - 2 for internet for 1 day. (At 125KB/s)
With all these Net Neutrality posts, it's unbelievable for me that people in USA pay $80 a month for 1MB/s.
I pay Q 355 for 1.2MB/s and 400KB/s upload, that's about $50 and it's the 2 to highest tier
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:52:17
...Not like they can right now. You don't even need to go all the way to Africa. Not even the average Mexican can afford to pay transactions at these levels. (Here in Guatemala daily salary is Q60 or $8, in Mexico is around the same or less)
Your comment also implies we'll scale on chain for ever, which would obviously be stupid. What I don't understand is why we can't increase block size _temporarily_ until all these futuristic sidechains are live. Had Core increased the block size two years ago we wouldn't have BCH right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:56:50
Lol I could pay my full degree with 5 Bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:46:56
Nice quote, I too agree with the attractiveness of PoS, except that it encourages people to hoard to become a "validator" which means the rich get richer. 
I saw some interesting research in PoS+PoW systems and in stuff like NavCoin which lets _anyone_  "vouch" for  blocks, so you earn some PoS reward without being a whale
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:44:36
It's.. true. They just copy/propagate the blockchain 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:24:30
We needed solutions two years ago!
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:43:59
Bcash is shit, yet more usable than BTC... Bitcoin needs innovation or is gonna lose its 1st place
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:47:33
But muh 2000%!!!?!
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:36:28
Nothing stops the attacker to go spam the _other_ nodes, which will _themselves_ block the attacker. Again, is not that one node blocks an attacker for everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:40:10
And they (ETH) do it by increasing block size/not limiting block size. I think they are over 5GBs a day or something. _They_ should have scaling drama, not BTC
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:33:42
You do realize that increasing the block size on BTC would render BCH useless right? Bitcoin Cash is great because fees aren't $20, in fact, it's the only advantage over Bitcoin why wouldn't you kill their only advantage?
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:18:12
I don't get what's so bad about a temporary increase to the block size. You can't even create a SegWit address in the Core UI (have to use console), I'd say that qualifies as not ready.
Why not increase block size _temporarily_ until SegWit addresses are default and easily made, people would be happy to move to SegWit at a low fee too. I have $10 worth of BTC.. Wait a week for my $1 fee to go through I guess
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:04:18
Yeah, such nonsense
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:38:06
We do, Core devs introduce people to LTC because you can't buy $1 worth of BTC anymore.. pathetic 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:21:03
There IS, because as Core says, on chain scaling has its limits 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:42:25
I sure hope. Honestly I don't think space is such a big issue, ETH is doing over 5GBs a day. Sure this is a problem but Bitcoin and even cash is far, far from this, yet ETH is thriving!
Anyways, you can [store a year's worth of 8MB blocks for the cost of a BTC transaction fee]( 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:43:34
Alright look, literally nobody is gonna spend their Bitcoins spamming the network! Who would be stupid enough to waste millions of dollars daily?
Maybe it's because _its not actual spam_ it's because *the whole world* heard that Bitcoin went from $3000 to $6000 in a month, and later from $7000 to freaking $12k and now *the whole world* wants to buy some, don't you think that kind of "spam" is to be expected? People buying $5 $10 $100 $1 "just to try"?
And as I said before, the only great feature about bcash is greater block size. If BTC increased it too, it would render bcash completely useless.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:28:05
Wow! I never thought about this. I just imagined myself presenting this to investors: _Bitcoin is amazing tech that will revolutionize the world _ and reaching the part where I say _and it supports 6 whole transactions per second_.. I'd be kicked out of that meeting and billed for their time.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:46:48
I'll try that thanks, is there a site where I can see when is the mempool empty?
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:51:41
Oh wait...
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:42:50
He limited it _temporarily_. I think right now we can do the exact opposite. Increased the block size _temporarily_ till all the wonderful alternative solutions are ready.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:22:49
Oh shit, shots fired 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:48:36
TIL HODL was meant to mean "not to day trade, but HODL".
I always thought it meant to hoard as much as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:26
Boom! Nailed it!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:52:43
Yo do realize all of this could be stopped by increasing the BTC block size temporarily until LN is ready? BCH's _only feature_ is block size. After all the change would be temporarily until solutions are ready.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:12:43
Honest question, do people actually use Bitcoin in Morocco? 
I just read that the minimum salary is 2000MAD (~$211) and the lowest transaction fee in the last 100 blocks was $15 or 141MAD. That means someone with minimum salary pays 7% of this money (supposed to last a month) in a single transaction.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:23:35
And Bitcoin XT
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:52:50
ETH chain grows 5GB+ per day, they're thriving!
Bitcoin? 144MB that's literally 100 Floppies _a day_ lol, in 2018.
Ok sure, unlimited space isn't logical, unlimited chain scaling is crazy, but really 1 MB is crazy too
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:42:42
Disagree, have you seen memo.cash? they're already re-enabling Bitcoin default op codes too. Soon we'll have decentralized torrents on top of BCH..
Last time I heard LN was out, cool! Well.. nobody is using it.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:23:09
Both chains are legit Bitcoin, or have the right to be called so. I follow both as I think both scaling solutions are worth a shot.
I believe instead of posts like this, we should focus on making Bitcoin (BTC) better, that's the only way a branch will win and honestly, right now I think the BCH community is more focused on innovating than BTC 
EDIT: I got banned! I'm reading your replies, message/chat if you're willing to have a conversation, really no hate involved.
Edit2: ok ok consensus! So if a year from now, BCH has more hashrate and value and overall work for the longest time.. would you then accept it as Bitcoin? I'd guess the answer would be **no** which proves my point made elsewhere: Bitcoin is an idea, and it's totally fine to have different ideas about what is Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:11:55
Hey that's cool!
EDIT: hey I meant it! Didn't know you could do that!
I'd love to have a peaceful conversation but it's gotta be elsewhere, because now I'm banned. :P
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:24:41
Wrong, both chains are Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:28:24
As I've said in other comments, I don't think we should be focusing on what twitter or roger are doing and start focusing on how to make Bitcoin better, remember BCH isn't the only other coin out there, we're competing against everyone.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:32:26
And who it is to say what makes a "valid Bitcoin block"? God? The government? You? Me? Roger ver? The Core devs? The current ones? The future ones? 
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:47:10
Exactly! And someone hoped and dreamed about Bitcoin not being limited by 1MB blocks and BCH happened! 
That's the whole point! More than math, Bitcoin is an idea, if  user thinks BCH is Bitcoin, so be it! If you think otherwise, so be it! No reason to fight!
EDIT: I'd love to answer your comments, feel free to message if you want a hate-free conversation. I got banned
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:39:33
Again.. the one proposed In 2009? Or the version after it? Or today's version? Or tomorrow's? 
My point is, Bitcoin is an idea, not some well established mathematical proof or physical law, everyone can agree on what gravity is or is not.
Bitcoin is more complex than that, one of its features is _being open source_ when there are dissenting ideas in open source, forks happen, there's nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:25:34
My only problem is that users only post stuff that supports their own side. I want to see a Good vs bad comparison, "head to head" and decide based on that my own opinion. I have even seen personal attacks and shaming people as "arguments" which looks childish and really doesn't make anything better. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:29:02
Space, is there a reason you should ever change your hard drive? Yes, when it's full.
LN in this analogy would be like using cloud storage. Your data is available to you, its just not in your personal hard drive.

Mods in this sub push opinions they agree with, and others get deleted. This is not how it should work. If you want consensus in multiple opinions, all opinions should be heard (and get up/downvoted) not deleted.
I agree r/btc has some circkejerk about many major opinions, but they do let _discussion_ happen, not plain censorship. Cant we just be civilized people and TALK?

We aren't responsible in what people trust anyways. Some people will never trust, some will.. nothing to do about that.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:12:48
Bitcoin is very hard to mine. Because of its growth on value and because it was first launched 8 years ago, theres a LOT of people mining. Adding to that, there are Bitcoin ASICS which are computers dedicated to mining Bitcoin, they are super fast in that one single thing.
I mine monero the most although ether is probably the most profitable. These two were "average laptop" mineable about 6months ago. Now you probably need a decent desktop PC to profit. To keep this Bitcoin related, you should always mine the  coin with the fastest ROI (return of investment) and buy your Bitcoins with your earnings.
This is probably too off Bitcoin topic so feel free to PM.

@_date: 2017-11-25 20:57:55
This is something I think about.. the more people _"HODL"_ the more expensive it gets.. which incentivizes others and already owners to keep holding.. up to a point where almost nobody trades their bitcoins.. and then what? What is gonna give it its value?

We are, but this kind of stories promote a get rich quick scheme (aka. Pump &amp; Dump) instead of a currency, which actually brings value to Bitcoin. 
This current price increase is heavily backed by people who want to buy because they've seen stories like this, not because they believe in bitcoin, this is the same people that will sell given it falls below their buy price.
The only other reason for Bitcoin to increase its price is because of the upcoming split &amp; free coins

@_date: 2017-11-16 18:34:51
You are correct, actually, Bitcoin only has _one_ advantage over everyone else: It was the first one and it's the most famous!
People have been hearing about Bitcoin since 2010-11.. ETH? LTC? Monero? What's that?
It's only one advantage, but it's a hell of a good one! (The more people get into BTC the more stable it becomes)
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:08:52
And the poor get un-poor (in crypto at least)
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:27:24
I understood that reference 
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:51:30
The block size has been increased before.. it used to be 100KB. I don't really know why people say bigger blocks mean more miner centralization, wouldn't bigger blocks make them process more data (and thus, mine slower)?
SegWit x2 was a good compromise, want old school on-chain bitcoin? Cool! Want SegWit? Cool!
The current block size is less than a floppy.. WTF??
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:39:51
I'd argue that the code would be pretty easy to implement cleanly, but don't really know much about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:21:26
It was called SegWit x2 and this sub shilled to death against it! Seriously! What was so wrong about 1 extra MB on chain??
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:42:14
Yeah how are you gonna bring economical freedom to the people that actually need it when that same people earn $6 a day (minimum salary in my country)? 
We need lower fees ASAP!
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:54:46
I agree with you, it will most likely crash. The people who believe hard in x2 will sell their normal Bitcoins to buy x2 when it crashes. This added to people cashing out and buying alts.
I'm just gonna move most to alts and enjoy the ride (since people have been selling alts for BTC)
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:15:05
Agreed. With the China ban it fell to that price, unless some more powerful government bans crypto, I doubt it will fall even more. (But even this not so bad scenario is around a 60% loss)
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:47:57
Yes.. or not, I guess they would just make less money.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:31:13
but even as of now, 71% of blocks are x2. if this would hold for the time of the fork I think it wouldn't be so hard to mine 100 blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:35:41
Agree with your comment.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:47:00
Nobody owns Bitcoin, there's nothing actually "Official" except for the protocol (because using any other will boot you off the network)

Woah woah! What's your secret ?

To be fair, dogecoin did x10 this year. Bitcoin did x13

True, but would it go long enough to say it's still a good time to buy?
EDIT: Legit question.

BCH is pre SegWit bitcoin.. if pre August BTC had value then BCH has too. If people think BCH is good what are we gonna do?

@_date: 2018-03-24 06:23:53
It's true! Except this kind of posts incentivize hoarding instead of spending, 
making the price speculative.
If we want the price to stabilize we need a healthy economy behind it, not people buying _because I'll sell when I have 194719% profits_. That's what causes pumps and dumps
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:46:38
They can call themselves whatever they want.. it's not true, probably childish, but still doesn't make them a scam

According to most people here, Bitcoin is being damaged by a single rich dude
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:25:12
Problem is, you may be good at it, but if the people you transact with aren't privacy-aware, you're still at risk. Monero takes this seriously and makes privacy a default and not an optional (currently at the cost of a little slower performance and a relatively high fee). 
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:35:10
I think it's superior because it's actually usable, that also means ETH or XMR are _far superior _ than both BTC and BCH, the same way, superiority is an opinion and I'll leave it to each one their own
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:11:25
This won't happen as long as people "hodl". Bitcoin will get scarce and price will rocked simply because nobody is gonna sell, price going up will discourage selling even more, reinforcing the cycle. 
The only way to bring stability is to drop the meme and fucking spend it like a currency instead of hoarding it like diamonds. Usage is what brings true value

The claim was based on a comment in this very thread.. it appears it's the top comment now. Basically someone on slack was testing stuff and force closed all his channels in an outdated state, other peers saw this as an attack and kept his balance.. of $25. Some people say the even gave the money back

Finally some non-propaganda opinion 
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:37:06
Agreed, is a low punch and often irrelevant. Wether Satoshi was an asshole or not IRL I'd still like Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:08:26
Just remember that for the price to be what it is, someone has to sell at that price and someone has to buy at that price.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:33:29
8 _max_. Actually Bitcoin used to have a 32MB limit, until it was reduced to 1MB to prevent spam, except the limit wasn't restored when needed, in favor of SegWit + LN (Soon ^™)
I personally think big blocks are the immediate way forward, yet I still like SW and LN, after all I'm here for the tech &amp; profits, not for the drama 
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:24:36
shit man, people heard you!

Bitcoin was the first, and the average Joe has heard of it. Litecoin? Not so much. 
Yes is true there are other factors like this one but my opinion stands. Why did ETH go up so much? People find it useful! 
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:12:04
The thing is, there is no point on naming them. If what they do is right or not, only time will tell
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:22:31
SegWit wasn't blocked, Core literally refused to increase to 2MB _while_ they developed SegWit, which itself is a size increase too. 
Should have they just increased the size a little we would have a single chain with SegWit right now.
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:03:00
You don't have to be _against_ BCH. I think both scaling solutions are worth a try, BCH got what they wanted, and it seems BTC did too.
After all, BCH and BTC are both the slowest and with less features of all cryptos, both need to step up or be eaten. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:45:41
Yeah even dogecoin, faster and 2 days ago, my no-fee transaction went though in 10min (default fee is 1doge anyways)
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:13:00
Bithoin 
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:59:42
They are also responsible for all this madness, have they agreed to 2MB blocks a year ago we'd have a single chain with SegWit right now.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:28:21
I'm not sure if it's related, but I read about miners publishing empty blocks as a way of "cancelling" such mining. It was something like "when you start mining a new block, you still have a bunch of data loaded onto the servers, which you can't delete easily, so you mine a block and put no transactions in it"
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:01:47
So you are saying it was everyone's fault because of no consensus? I guess I'll have to agree.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:46:02
As much as this is based on truth, all stories have two sides. Bitcoin is open source for a reason: don't like something? Change it!
If what you did works,  people will find value on it and use it. Didn't work? Will become worthless. There is no need to put a hate list at the end of every post, people are irrelevant in this debate. I invite you to look at "the other side's perspective" (which is biased too) to have a middle ground opinion 
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:39:55
Oh alright, thanks 
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:34:42
Yes, to some. You'd still need a farm/initial investment though 
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:12:06
The thing is, there is no point on naming them. If what they do is right or not, only time will tell
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:47:17
Ah i get it, and agree. I just hate how this sub promotes BCH hating so much... to the point of being OK with some dude telling the govt. it's a scam when it's not.
It's not even fun anymore.. BTC went to $20k and back, LN is live and all is great yet this gets to r/all??
_I know BTC is ok now, It's just too late. Check my comments in other posts, Latin America adopted BCH faster than BTC for obvious reasons_
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:03:00
Instead of this stupid bets please donate all these BTCs to charity!! (Or I could take them, no problem)
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:36:21
ELI5. If increased block size means miners need to process more data, why are the miners pushing it?
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:18:29
Genius! Let's call it umm Bit..Coin!
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:25:30
I see, but bigger blocks also mean less fees (because they are not full) which even opens up the possibility of free transactions. 
I'd argue keeping the network at 1MB or less and preventing _any_ scaling solution would actually be considered an attack from the miners. 
EDIT: Implying such attack is no longer possible as we have either SW or bigger blocks
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:04:23
I guess it would be more suitable, yes. Except some people thing these corps are good and some don't.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:03:10
Hmmmm, true. Except this would mean both sides are doing the same thing right?

@_date: 2018-04-19 16:17:20
Monero was at risk only soon after the fork, as more time passes anonymity rebuilds
Also privacy is broken only if you spend in more than 1 chain, if you stick to 1 then you're good
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:36:15
Forks are the legit way of dealing with different opinions.. it worked as expected. Both chains are Bitcoin, no matter how much one hates the other.
I just hold both and enjoy the ride. No need to dump BCH for some sort of political statement.
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:01:29
As more time passes, more outputs are generated in Monero chain that don't exist in _somefork_ chain while the opposite happens too. Given enough time, all transactions will be anonymous again

We're wrong to think with him gone all will be fixed. He's just 1 guy so either
a) He's not alone

AFAIK The objective of ripple is to be used as digital representation of something in the real world and is not supposed to be traded like other coins, something like a business to business coin and not a "currency".
This supports the idea that it shouldn't be listed in exchanges though.

Thanks, I agree
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:31:29
I don't see how your comment relates to the parent, what he's saying is that Monero's current chain was at some point at 179MH/s vs the "classic" chain, which was 600MH/s 
Even now, sometimes, the old chain has more power, yet people don't think of this one as legit
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:01:48
Not really, the fact that Bitcoin Diamond or Bitcoin Gold are nowhere to be seen makes me think cash is actually being a good rival.
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:29:25
AFAIK it's because of compatibility. Segwit only works on Core.. BU is compatible with core versions compiled for a larger block size. I think

Monero is currently working on fluffyblocks, which will reduce size by a lot. Var-size is really a concern since chain could grow bigger faster than other cryptos but at least it will always be fast and r/Monero will never have posts like this.
