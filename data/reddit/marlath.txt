I do agree with you here. That 400k order, and a previous one that day, were both one bid by one person.

Sorry. I corrected it to say wrong instead.

WRONG. It was not minutes after that it moved, but a full 10 seconds before.
The bid wall dropped and the dump started at exactly 2:06:18 EST.
He posted that 'good night' message at 2:06:28 EST. (
He had a full ten seconds to paste that message.
This is how this pirate has conned everyone into thinking he is anything but BS. He has a websocket client that isn't lagged like the popular html5 ones are, and simply waits for the action on that to start and then announces that he caused it. Everyone using some browser based feed doesn't see the drop until after he saw it and announced it hoping people wouldn't notice that his announcement comes long after the actual move he claims credit for.
reddit user zooko brings up the two reasons it is obvious he is bs:
1) I would think if someone were in the business of performing such market manipulation, then they wouldn't talk about it in public. Right? Because that would make it harder to do it (again) successfully.
2) If you're looking to attract attention from people in order to get them to subscribe to your (ponzi) scheme, it would make sense to publicly claim credit for moving the market, whether or not you actually had anything to do with it.

My analysis:
Someone who in real life had lots of money and trading experience simply did this:
Instead of invest a large % of his wealth into BTC, where a) he doesn't know if it will go up, and b) isn't willing to put a big enough % of his wealth into BTC for it to be worth his while, instead, he buys some amount of BTC, then places huge walking bid walls using a serious chunk of his wealth (that he would never risk by actually buying BTC with it) and then sells his BTC holding once he has pushed the price up as much as he feels he can safely do in one short term rally. (short term = cheap cost to affect and good payout for time). Then he just sells his holding in one go, eating up the fools who bid above his target price to sell to. He keeps enough BTC based upon the market size to then amplify the PANIC caused by the large sell off. He amplifies it by placing walking ask walls. These obviously won't be as large as the bid walls since he would hurting the value of his such BTC he is asking with. This is what we have seen. Massive bid walls. Small ask walls comparatively. If pirate were doing this we would see huge ask walls after the sell off, but we do not. Once the price is as low as he can get it short term, he will buy another chunk of BTC for very cheap (price down below where it should be due to fear from massive sell off amplified by the ask walls) so that he can repeat the whole process.
After he buys the coins at the low, he raises his massive bid walls, but also puts up massive ask walls to make it look balanced and organic. Then as he continues to raise the bid walls he starts dropping his asks to make it look like the sellers are drying up and moving higher. This really affects people into thinking the buyers are winning and they panic buy the price up to get what is left of the dwindling asks.

They risk it falling OR rising, they average out. No issue here.
Especially since automatically selling the BTC instantly is a feature available with most BTC cart / button services.
