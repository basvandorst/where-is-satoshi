After losing some money on Bitcoin exchanges, I decided to develop my own Trading bot/helper. This bot acts with pre-defined parameters based on statistics/strategies and not with the emotion of the moment, so it's much easier to perform trading operations.
HAL10K is a Bitcoin trading/helper bot written in PHP (open source). It was developed to be used on the API MtGox, but can be easily adapted to other exchanges. Their decisions are based on customizable parameters and trading techniques for market analysis. It also works in semi-automatic mode, in which each loss(stop-loss) asks via Twitter for remote confirmation of a bot operator. Besides the "Live Trading" so it also runs simulations "Backtesting/Paper trading" using "Fake Balance" and historical raw data from BitcoinCharts.com. All bot actions(buying/selling) and alerts(high volume detected) are notified via Twitter. Log results is accompanied by HTTP Control panel where the bot displays its own performance chart panel.

Thanks all, today 12/12 a guy named DAMIJAN MERLAK @ Bitstamp solved my problem. After many, many emails sent to both parts at the point of AstroPay contacts Bitstamp, my deposit was processed manually.

Today the same guy ROK ŠTUCIN answered me (almost two weeks).
"payments involving AstroPay are processed through their service and their site therefore our support is limited in cases involving the payment process on their site. We kindly ask you to please contact AstroPay at direct and ask them to provide you with the identification number of the transfer in question so we can better assist you with locating your missing transfer."
I had already sent them the transaction data that AstroPay sent me, now will wait more two weeks for support answer?
Bitstamp support is really sick!
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:39:13
Maybe.. the developer said he abandoned the project ..
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:34:06
Hey Bitstamp support, if you're reading this reddit... My patience is over. I want my $512.50 that was deposited on 11.25.2013 and never arrived in my Bitstamp account. My money back or I will be seeking legal means to resolve this problem.
All details on TICKET 
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:03:52
 Update us.. bitstamp already processed your deposit?
