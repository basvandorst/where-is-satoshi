My main complaint with the BCH crowd is that they're trying to sell BCH as 'the true Bitcoin'.
But yes, only one will survive, but I think it's going yo be Bitcoin, as it's the original and whenever someone says 'cryptocurrency' to most people that means 'Bitcoin'. Cash will probably die out as there are so many better alternatives, making it nothing special, other than it's name.

50%? Wow, I'm glad that where I live has no capital gains tax.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:20:09
I love Bitcoin, and get that this is huge. But god damn is it cringey.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:32:01
To be fair, whenever I see BCH, I immediately think 'B Cash'.  Though I do understand your point.

I also accept cheques for USDCoin, really good investment if you ask me...
(Can you short USD?)
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:27:26
Because it's an alt with Bitcoin's name 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:21:24
I just thought this was a bit interesting and worth sharing. :)

Why the hell are you getting downvoted? You're entirely correct, deflationary currencies are terrible and will never work.

LOL, if by 'murderer in the house' you mean a genuine reason for a drop (Jamie Dimon) then it wouldn't be a bad idea to buy the dips, but if the price drops 90% for no reason at all, it's safe to say Bitcoin is dead. 
Then again if you're talking about a literal murderer, you wouldn't want your finger prints on the murderers knife.
@_date: 2019-06-12 23:51:07
Deflationary currencies are fucking horrible for any economy you dumbasses

Ever heard of plastic surgery?

You realize you just implied that your preventing other people from making a mistake?
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:33:12
And hopefully it shall stay that way!

If they read "What has the government done to our money" by Rothbard, they'd understand why it's the best currency.

1. Gets Paycheck
2. Buys Bitcoin
3. Watches Bitcoin fall
4. Sells Bitcoin
5. Watches Bitcoin rise
6. Checks r/Bitcoin and gets told to HODL

Oh, we can only hope

A possibility, but can people really be this stupid?

@_date: 2017-10-30 09:27:57
You gave me anxiety, well done.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:05:57
I'll tell them "well I did tell you to invest and you said No, it's a scam. So no."
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:47:15
Yes a reason to live!
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:07:17

I got my mum into Bitcoin at around $2300, she's more than doubled her money (thanks to the BCH split) and now I'm her favorite child.
