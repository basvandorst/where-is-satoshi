Is this your safe space? Sorry about that.

Thank you for the detailed response.
Yes, I was aware of Grisham's Law which is what led me to question your OP. Thiers' Law is new and makes sense,
except I cannot [yet] see the Govt just throwing up their hands and giving up control to a decentralized system outside their control.
What would prevent a Govt from implementing a more-centralized, immutable blockchain and requiring its use (fiat)?
Do I want to live in a deflationary economy? Will my wages be sticky, or at what rate will my earnings drop?
People who own Things (houses, etc) are going to be very disappointed when we move to a deflationary economy. How does production of goods work in deflation? From design to the sales floor the price would be decreasing. Would producers be motivated to produce?

Thanks for these tidbits.
It has also since occurred to me, that any attempt to add rigs to get to up 51% would be chasing a moving target.
where x = current hash power
and y = 1/2x =~ 51%
(x + y) / 2 &gt; y 
y &lt; ~51% of the new total sum of hashpower

Um, let me guess, better 'cause the 0.000011 BTC are going to the moon?
Better, 'cause spending 0.000011 BTC would cost me a Satoshi and take 25 minutes?
Better, 'cause I cannot [easily] spend them so I save them instead?

Please tell me more about


Bitcoin acceptance among retailers has always been low and real growth in acceptance eludes me.
That must mean I am not


As your understanding of monetary economics is *completely correct* and therefore superior to mine, please help me out!
Where is the growth in Bitcoin acceptance in the marketplace? I would think that growth in acceptance would preclude any *squeezing out of all competitors*. But I am nowhere near as smart as you are.
When will Amazon, with 600 transactions per second, be able to accept Bitcoin?
You are probably not a taxpayer, so therefore you loath fiat. I am a taxpayer, and I must find a way to obtain fiat in order to pay my taxes using a government-decreed currency. Are you implying that my government will fail and I will not have to pay any taxes? **Woot!**
As *you have been paying attention and have a correct understanding of monetary economics*, and you are [somehow?!] able to correctly predict the future, please tell me what the price of coffee will be in Bitcoin. My [likely] incorrect understanding of Bitcoin transactions is such that it cannot even be economically done today using this by-far-superior blockchain currency.
You glossed over the part where Bitcoin destroys fiat currency and squeezes out all competitors.
Can you do an ELI5 for those whom you insult as "dumbasses"?

Yes. Just edit the program code.


51% of the miners have a say in that.
It is only "decentralized" for as long as Jamie Dimon does not control 51% hashing power.
