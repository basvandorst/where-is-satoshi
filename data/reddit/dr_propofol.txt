Thank you, Sir

Nope. This is the only reason I'm considering selling. I brought in at 2000, and it's been steady up/down until now. 
I have an alert on anything under 14K or over 17K. If it goes beyond either, I'll likely sell
Just my 2p

Tomorrow, bitcoin will be opened in the Futures market, meaning big Wall Street people can bet for/against bitcoin. So it will likely cause BTC to skyrocket or crash in the short term. That's my basic understanding at least

I had a newbie showerthought...
I don't understand why people might short bitcoin, as they can't influence other people selling. 
But if they put futures money on bitcoin increasing in value, they could then buy actual bitcoins on the side to influence the market themselves and increase their likelihood of success

In case anyone is interested, I've taken out my initial investment plus half my profit (which totals about 4x my initial investment).
If it drops, I'll have the opportunity to re-invest at a cheaper price or just take my profit away. 
If it skyrockets, I'm still invested (although with reduced profits).
I'm not a bitcoin expert and have pretty limited prediction skills, so I've gone for what I feel is the "financially smart" move

It's cool man. I already put my £200 in
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:18:07
Yeah, but buying now is surely wrong as it's the highest it's ever been. In the summer it dropped to half the current price

How can I find your your site/group?
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:03:57
Yeah man. I went for it and invested my first £200. I'm bad at saving, so this is an interesting alternative
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:01:48
I think it's satire?

Can you point me in the direction of a coin exchange? I used CoinBank originally
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:30:16
Silly question. If the value just shot up, surely it's best to wait until it drops a bit before buying?

I have been out of bitcoin for a month. So I've also been *waiting* for Coinbase to "verify my bank account" for a month. 
I've payed the deposit to verify my account, which came with a £10 charge so I'm not doing another. Their site claims that it will take 1-2 days to verify the amount, but it's been a month. I emailed customer service twice with no reply. 
I didn't have a single barrier to depositing money. Gave them money without a hitch. But I am UNABLE TO WITHDRAW anything and don't know where else I can go for help. It's close to stealing
