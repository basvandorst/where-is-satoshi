How can we now take everything else he says seriously?
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:40:50
This is the head fake before we rally tomorrow
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:35:52
Odds may be against me, but the demand and the technicals are not.
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:22:44
I’d scissor Marge
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:24:20
Yeah in a typical bull market it’s protocol to have BTC pull back 40% (that has been done). ✅. It’s also protocol to have Alts fall 40% off their highs and that’s now been done as of two days ago. The setup is spot on but very confusing on the surface, confusing enough to have fear and greed index at a 30 and the masses. It’s actually obvious taking in all the facts
@_date: 2019-07-13 07:54:30
I said I called the rallies

Watch the master
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:45:32
I measured the size of the flagpole and added it to the pendant flag (in which has not yet taken full shape), I was able to conclude that it was going to take full shape because of several other metrics. The lower highs, rsi, and volumes. The most compelling metric is not a metric of rational understanding by evaluating BTC Dominance in regards to Alts and where Alts are in developments pertaining to their current prices. Huge developments coming for Alts by 2020. That means Alts should make their move by August 25th, and that doesn’t give Bitcoin much more time to rise to ATH. Therefore Alts are poised any day for a 200% run, so BTC needs to act and move fast.
Edit: flagpole
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:28:10
I said rally.

Yeah briefly I think
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:43:04
No I posted it before the rally!
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:15:15
@_date: 2019-04-18 20:11:05
Yeah, you can read the chart two ways for sure, but to me it’s looking like a return to average of $6,200 is reasonable.
@_date: 2019-04-24 04:44:03
Suckers rally
@_date: 2019-04-27 04:28:00
I agree. Why the F is Tether not crashing ?
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:32:48
I have absolutely no idea. It’s just crazy there is no resistance till $6,000. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 03:41:09
@_date: 2019-04-18 20:38:15
This is true, but as an investor in alts too, and I see a lot of top projects completing their developments as promised. From a business person analysis, I think the top 50 alts should be valued 20%-200% higher, and therefore a 20% move in BTC is reasonable and thus the reason for the charts to play out.
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:31:56
Nah!!! Just wait a few hours �� 
@_date: 2019-04-24 22:57:56

I’ll take the gold
@_date: 2019-04-18 21:22:44
Average trend line over the last 2-4 years is $6,200. That’s the mean
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:03:46
Hahha! I wish 
@_date: 2019-04-18 21:30:22
I’m going to have to agree with you that those seemed to be priced fairly but to name a few the following need to adjust higher: ETH + 20% ONT+ 100%, NEO + 100% , Maker + 100%, TEZOS + 75%, Stellar + 75%, Icon + 50%. Edit: BTC + 20%
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:23:40
That’s it, I’m going to Vegas!

It is possible. Just really bad for Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:15:15
I posted $7,400 last week. Go look. BTC was at $5,400

So, you’re basically telling me you’re broke. Nice. Congrats

Move the rainbow down a little. Then it’s sell you fools
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:01:18
It will never work unless you have full-time management to verify, notarize, and cross check every identification to get the seed id’s. This will take a staff of 100,000 more employees. Microsoft is opening them selves up to a lawsuit for every stolen identity on the planet. Worst idea ever.
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:46:06
Bitcoin doesn’t have finality. You can roll it back

Have you tried calling 1-800-Bitcoin? Ask for Satoshi. If he doesn’t answer you can go into a Bitcoin branch and let the manager know about the issue. Don’t worry, all funds are FDIC insured. Perhaps fax a complaint to Houbi. Let them know in the memo your issue. Also, make sure to send them your private keys to all your other accounts so that they can make sure that your accounts are safe prior to processing. Write to the Better Business Bureau and let them know you have a bunch of address with tons of numbers and letters and that you want them to track them down. Then call legal aid. Tell the clerk at the Legal Aid Foundation that you want to sue the pants off Houbi. Legal Aid will then send you to We the People where you can incorporate your company in Delaware so you look super official with that 1btc asset. Then go to Manhattan New York, and pitch your case to the top 10 world class law firms in the City. After they fight and beg you for the case, make sure that they take it on a contingency. The publicity alone for this is enough. If that somehow doesn’t work, then call Hooked on Phonics, purchase the DVD via mail and learn Mandarin Chinese. Then send the CEO of Huobi a page to his beeper to call you back. In your new Mandarin tongue, explain exactly your situation and I’m sure that he’ll return your Bitcoin immediately.
Edit: he’ll

You obviously don’t know where most of the demand from trading pairs for BTC comes from that raises the price. Do you? Didn’t thinks so. Therefore I’m now pretty sure you probably don’t even own any Bitcoin. I’m sorry, it sucks to be poor. Perhaps look into learning about crypto currencies, and also Bitcoin while you’re at it, or you gunna be poor forever.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:57:49
So you are broke. Nice. That sucks

Mine froze in the US. I think it’s cuz I purchased a lot. They needed me to fill out a form stating that I wasn’t a currency dealer. I said it was for personal investment and two weeks later and one  almost late credit card payment they reopened it.
