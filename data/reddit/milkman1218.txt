Borders use natural landmarks most of the time. Rivers, mountains, jerry mandered districts.

The comment I was looking for.

Can I use Bitcoin to get into area 51?

Newbie here, just transferred half my btc to Link, seemed like the right move today.

Exchange rates, some alts like Etherium are exchanged at a higher rate than physical bitcoins.

Wouldn't transfers between coins boost the overall value way higher than simply hodling. I understand from a savings point but if you got the money, transfer it into alts and try to boost the economy. Then sell back to Bitcoin.

High on potenuse maybe

I tried to make a post when it hit 9.2 to buy because it wasn't going to drop that low again. I still hodl strong on that statement.

What's wrong with coinbase? I understand the increase in percentage for their cut, but how is it not safe?

I've definitely started investing seriously into Bitcoin. Watched it for years, should definitely think about some personal tech.

It's natural due to all the people selling dropping the market shares.

Fiat when backed by gold is different.
@_date: 2019-12-10 02:02:05
It's no different with cash. You can hide it all in your matress. It's a concept of money. Banks make sense, it's corruption that sucks, Bitcoin is already corrupt in certain segments. It's following the same path as fiat, which it was supposed to mimic based on it's gold backed value.

Did you even read Satoshi's method of how he created Bitcoin? Banks are banks no matter what. There was even a cashe of sea shells that the native Islanders used as currency before colonial times. It just depends if you want a bank to hold all your money or you.

Something something currency needs banks, Bitcoin is no different, choose the right bank and you're fine. Coinbase isn't shady, don't believe the fear.

1 week later, 10 million.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:36:44
Cash has its own banking system built in too, it's called a wallet. Wait I'm sensing a pattern.
@_date: 2019-09-23 23:02:28
I hope it goes to 5k that's a hell of a dip one should buy.
@_date: 2019-09-10 17:04:44
At least he somewhat gets it. The other people thought we still had gold backing our dollar!
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:41:07
False, gold never tarnishes
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:48:13
Couldn't buy more until today! Buy the dip baby!!
@_date: 2019-09-11 01:25:56
In a month and a half I've turned a 600 into 900 to help pay for gas to pick up my new home haha. Sometimes even if you have little debt and tight margins, smart investing can yield any result.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:49:17
We caught it Bois, good job! I bought the dip who else??
