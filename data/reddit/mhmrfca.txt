Give us a little bit... we're getting there!

Yes... and no. I will endeavor to cash out when its most valuable to do so, just to get the most value out of a donation. I try to be the best steward of any funds (or goods) we have, to make it go the furthest we can and do the most good.

Thanks for the input on Coinbase. I do not have any Bitcoins myself. I've only heard about them through my Brother-in-Law, a long time member of Reddit and self described "minimal Bitcoin user." 
What makes Electrum "easiest." Setup? Use? 
Lost me on the security thing. Wow. O_o. Way over my head. I had looked into a "paper wallet?" As I understand it, you can print it out and the coins are now associated with the slip of paper rather than a computer site so that they cannot be accessed until the key on the paper is re-entered. That seemed like a fairly secure method. but then again... not a very technical person here.

Thanks for the advice. Will check into bitpay. Had not heard of it and will also see if Coinbase offers a specific deal for charities. 
Also... thanks for the offer on the button. May be coming back to you on that.

I don't think taking it as far as backing it up on a separate computer is going to be necessary for our purposes. We're looking to take the donations and put them to use right away. I think the people looking for that level of protection are those looking at this as an investment tool and plan on accruing much larger sums than we plan on leaving in the Bitcoin accounts.

That was something I was looking into yesterday as well. Saving a back up on a usb drive.

It does seem like paper wallet is the safest way to go for our purposes.

We're getting there....
Just getting set up!
