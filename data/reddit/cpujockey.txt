Na man, you got a separate scammer trying to phish you on that one. I used a virgin email address when the guy contacted me.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:21:20
I have seen this kinda shit before. It is no beuno. they could support a site like this using a lot of ads, but instead it looks like they are making it as intrusive as possible. I give it 3 months, service will shut down.
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:31:39
good lord, there has got to be a way we can keep following the money, sooner or later this jack ass is going to want to exchange btc for cash - or buy something. once he sends that coin to an address that has a public face we could find out if they exchanged personal info with that person

While i know we all just 2fa shamed him, thats totally not cool to ostracize him and tell him to go back to fiat. sure we all learn from our mistakes, his was a grave one, but still doesn't merit name calling and malice.

@_date: 2014-06-29 23:03:39
Yeah I got that one too! It originally started with a PM from: check out the data I yanked from the header!
It seems like these guys are retarded to think that someone that handles bitcoin shit would be dumb enough to not look at headers.
Be safe bitbros!

you are either trolling, or really stupid.
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:03:33
It didn't come from that address, the scammer forged their records to use that as a return address.

if you only bet with what you get from the faucet it is 0 risk, albeit frustrating.
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:40:40
you could always take a hand at using the faucet at primedice and playing some dice till you win what was stolen from you.
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:15:38


Then don't be a genderist, just say humans or people in reference to folks using bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:06:47
im not saying you should go beat down faucets, im just saying they give you 1k satoshi in their faucet to gamble with for free!
if you are smart about betting you can turn that into profit with out spending a dime and having fun!
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:07:30


I did some googling, not alot of info on that address, but eventually he or she will want to put that into another wallet, so if we keep an eye on it, find the next transfer we might get closer to finding it out.

@_date: 2014-01-13 19:37:12
well dont lose hope because of a loss, there is still some awesome stuff you can do in the mean time. besides, it shouldnt be about making fiat money, you should be interested in vitalizing the economy of bitcoin. I would look on block chain to see if you can find the address the funds went to, then see if you can find out more about that address and possbily find the person the did this to you.

@_date: 2013-11-11 19:07:43
To be honest, there is no such thing as a secure OS. Look at the market share Windows has. Look at the market share that linux, and OSX have
Now think about all the new mac threats that have come out of the wood work because they got into double digit market share. TFW you realize apple licensed ASLR from microsoft to help mitigate threats. TFW linux gets virus's too. TFW you give any idiot an administrator password they can fuck things up trying to download a "plugin" so they can watch bieber fight some douche - and then they get a virus.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:40:41
OP, you can still visit the site in safari and pin it to your home screen... it sucks they killed the app but it doesnt mean you cant do shit with coinbase in meantime

It is important to remember, while some merchants are using bitpay, not everyone is going straight to USD, some merchants are holding on to bitcoin in speculation - while this bothers me, it does open the opportunity to have some folks exchange these bitcoins for local goods / services. The big thing is convincing more folks to adopt bitcoin to make spending them as easy as possible; thusly making the amount of goods and services available for purchase is paramount. 
I do not know if there is an immediate solution for making bitcoin only economy, but so long as everyones' hearts are in the right place we stand to make that future happen.
Almost forgot, howdy neighbor!

putting 10% in is kind of a gamble at the moment i would think. I am not an expert, but if you were to invest now say your 10% was like 100 bucks. that would only render about .4 btc. but say if btc dropped down to $5 a btc, it would mean that render alot more every week and thusly if the price were to skyrocket to 500 per btc you would then sell at that point and make a groovy profit. idk, im an idiot when it comes to math.
