In the FAQ:
Q: "Can I lose Money?"
A: "No. Losing is mathematically impossible in our trading strategy. In case of any severe loss, we are in possession of a 1300 BTC reserve Fund."
Makes sense right?

Im not for GAW or anything, but you have to understand its very hard for him to come and do an AMA when this subreddit clearly feels strongly against GAW.
It wouldn't not be a civilized dissucion, there is enough unjustified hate. Some of everyone's points are valid while others are pure logical fallacies. Its the exact same as haters being censored on hash talk, you guys down vote any opinion that's not yours.
Josh will never do an AMA if everything he says and does is responded with blind rage. If you don't like GAW don't give him money, this is a free market right?
EDIT: I would just like to see everyone be more civilized about this.

Well before they where just a wallet but now they are also trying to be an exchange of some simple capacity.

That's a boldfaced lie, it has many times.

Well that money is most likely going to be spent, would you rather they give away money to promote Bitcoin awareness or use the money for R&amp;D and marketing. It's probably just different priorities in their budgets. Xapo's incentive is it's debit card and vault services, so why do they need to push slightly less crummy referral deals?

Nice! If I had that money I'd totally invest.

Yeah I have like 900 bits on there that I have been trying to take out for AGES. I could never take it out because there fees where stupidly unusable. Now they want my SSN? I am not going to give them my SSN. How about just asking for my last few digits?

It's a pretty simple algorithm to write but it's not practical because there's no good way to solve 51 factorial perumations, you would need tons of CPU. Same reason why long passwords aren't easy to crack.

If a shipping company is overwhelmed they may use third parties to provide trucks. For example Amazon uses a uber like system for some deliveries.

If you overly worried and need peace of mind, I would call trezor and consider a return/reorder.
