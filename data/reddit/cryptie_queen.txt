By the way Sir/Madam definitely ppl vl reach out to you vth thir sad stories and it doesnt really hard if you would like to help another human being with HUMANITY ,after all you are doing this as charity ! If I put up my story here it sounds an individual donation request,but it is !

Thats a huge loss an sorry for your loss !
Thats true damn with the criticism,you have a family you have a life,people think about it.
You damn scammers/hackers can you see what you are doing to the people's lives.Stop stealing money and get a life and save lives.
For the amount of BTCs I lost I couldnt sleep for many weeks,can imagine what the poor boy would have gone through.
Take care mate !

Many websites give good education about Crypto unfortunately everyone desnt go through the right docs and fall a prey for the scams !
@_date: 2019-11-11 21:05:15
There are very few companies accepting Bitcoin,so was this deal between Agency and Owner ! Good to know !

@_date: 2017-11-22 16:52:02
With my knowledge they do but always do your research to stay safe and dont trust anyone except yoruself and if you have many coins prefer trezor.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:51:43
Irrespective Satoshi around or not he always stands on the top of the influential person list for BTC  !
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:17:14
Agreed totally and so was the reason I purchased and lost them for the hackers :(

@_date: 2017-11-21 20:29:19
Very much needed information,but too late for me after the hacking of my BTCs.
@_date: 2018-11-14 04:44:12

@_date: 2018-11-16 18:53:33

@_date: 2018-11-14 04:42:49
I exactly joined after 4 days of my btc liss which was nov17thbaroumd in 2017, not sure why it shows 6 weeks, you can see my joining date ! I see the anove comments for my post where frw of them have trolled it might be a joke fir few but iknow my pain and did my best to post it here and bitcoin forums to be aware of such scams , anyways my loss cannot be recovered as that was the way btc transactions were created. Happy the scammers are who stole my butcoins. Stay warm everyone !

To explain it and cut down the lengthy conversation,I was myself a newbie for Crypto in 2017 and was holding BTCs since March 2017 and in the first week of November 2017 my coinbase account was locked out and I quickly searched out for coinbase customer care number which popped up with the website in google [ I have a record of all these ] and called them immiedaitely on this and they took all my information and requested to send out an email to coinbase which I did and updated me that they would follow up on regular basis to ensure I get access to my account back which they did and unfortunately I got access to my account back on November 13th'2017 and they did call me and took control to my system assuring they would move the assets to more secure systems,with minimal knowledge in crypto and no knowing that such scammers were existing and believing they were from coinbase I ended up loosing my BTCs forever to their accounts ! However, rather support here in this forum , there are worse and dark souls making fun of the unfortunate situation ! Guess the scammers were better just robbed and absconded but here ppl are waiting for a chance to poke you more !! Anyways thankyou for your time ! It was an expensive lesson for me but hope nobody else gets into similar one !
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:22:11
Its a huge and expensive lesson but I did my best to atleast create awareness in the groups ! Thankyou !
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:38:46
Agree with you,in that case Bitcoiin can only be handled by highly intellectual people ?? What about common man/woman ! Infact Iam a woman and a computer science graduate and was randomly chosen by scammers to get my bitcoins robbed ,I dont say Iam highly intellectual but wth the education I have I shouldnt have been robbed but unfrotunately I was robbed as the scammers potrayed themselves as coinbase and took control over the system and moved out my bitcoins ! However,Iam not an anti-bitcoiner ,I very well respect the technology but bothers me on the security standards and people who are going to use should have clear and updated knowledge if need to use/handle Bitcoins :(
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:28:01
WAs typing from my mobile ! My bitcoins were robbed from me in the year 2017'Nov and my intent of awareness was to atleast update in the forums on the unfortunate story of mine on how I was reached by scammers and the way my bitcoins were taken away from me ! I appreciate rather trolling around or making fun of somebody else's fortune and grammar,it would be nice to either keep quiet or not to make any comments or atlease speak about the further security measures you would like to share for newbies in the forum ! Thanks !
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:29:55
Thanks bud ! Here I was scammed by the scammers who posed themselves as Coinbase representatives ,who would'nt believe when you get a call from the exchange where your digitals assetts are stored ! They projected themselves as coinbase customer care !
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:12:07
Thankyou Sir ! Your response is pathetic alike my communication ! No issues,came across the good and bad humans in this journey ,doesnt matter to encounter more :) Makes me grow strong !
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:26:59
Oh my god !!!! Sorry for your loss ! I know what you could be going through as I was on the same page a year and half back and it was not an easy thing to handle ! Hope a miracle happens !
