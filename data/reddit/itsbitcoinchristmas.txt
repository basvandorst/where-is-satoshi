I wasn't sure of the date, and with the WB tweet stating "tomorrow" without a specific date and the official website stating Jan 1st I was quite confused.
Needless to say I have it taped now and I'm ready to watch it!

Wait a year or two and sell them on the next BTC-e

*Encryption. Not even once.*

And to my worst grandson, I leave my safe and all of it's contents.
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:15:12
Well we're all set, then!
Who's going to start selling GPS safes for BTC now?

I wouldn't think so... they might have a copy, but it should be heavily encrypted at best to the point that even they would have a tough time cracking it.
Has Peter Todd ever used AWS?
You can upload your own public keys as big as you'd like and only allow ssh logins through that key from the get-go.
You can upload your own custom images and check their hashes before running them, etc...
If they're doing it right, there is no way that any three letter agency could "have a copy of their databases" unless they explicitly gave it to them.
Please explain if anything I have said above is incorrect.

Poor Data :(

Even better, though I don't know how well the transmitters would work from inside a solid metal box. Plus you would have to keep replacing the batteries.

*"I just wanted to hang out with all of my friends so I brought these two body guards with me!"*
@_date: 2015-01-17 23:09:07
How embarassing.
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:26:16
It's name is *crickets*.

Fill it with bricks.
"Damn, Jerry! There's a ton of gold in this one!"

There is no such thing as a fire*proof* safe. They all only guarantee goods to be protected from heat for about 1 hour.
If your fireproof safe is sitting in 1,000C coals for 2 hours, the aluminum sticks inside of it are going to melt.
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:05:41


Certain Stainless Steels can withstand upwards of 1800C before melting.
I would consider that fireproof.
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:01:07
That could work!

They are all competitors, they just aren't doing very well.

I didn't pose a question... me thinks you're the buttcoiner/troll now.

The site has been live for almost 4 years now... can you really blame somebody for not checking the site news daily if they deposited some BTC 3 years ago and forgot about it?
Banks in canada can never legally assume ownership of funds held in their reserves, no matter how long the real owner takes to assume ownership, nor should they be able to. The owner could be in a coma, dead with the money willed to some unknowning person, etc...
CaVirtex is trying to do what banks are not allowed to... because they're not a bank.

Cody Wilson is a crazed anti-government lunatic imho from every talk I have seen him give.

I never got a phone call.
That still doesn't explain why they didn't email everybody which would have been simple to do.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:47:33
Glad to hear it!
