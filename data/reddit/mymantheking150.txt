I think Paxful is the way to go in this case. Paxful is used by a lot of Nigerians.

Well I'm new as well but from what I understand, bitcoin is going down right now so it may be the right time to buy before it goes back up? I mean, no one can really say WHEN or IF it's going to back up, but I feel that it's a good time to buy at the moment, given it's current price right now.
(Veterans please tell me if I'm doing this wrong lol)

Agreed. I've had scares like this before but Paxful always comes through.

One thing that's not on this review: Paxful has done so many things for Africa like build schools and now they're putting in a blockchain hub over there. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I like Paxful a lot because I can really feel that they care.

Truly the end of an era for one of the bitcoin trading juggernauts. Good thing I've got an account on Paxful as well. I'm going to switch to that permanently now.

Luno and Paxful come to mind. Luno is cool but I honestly prefer Paxful. Their customer service is much better.

The 300+ payment methods is what made me sign up on there to begin with. Power to the gift cards!
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:29:05
Yup, what they're doing for Africa is amazing.

Their customer support is one of the best in the game. Almost lost my money but someone from the support team helped me get my money back.

When it comes to trading, I really think that peer-to-peer is the way to go and I think that Paxful is one of the better ones.

I actually just use my Paxful wallet to keep all my bitcoin, but after I invest a significant amount of money I intend on getting a hardware wallet.

I watch we the cryptos on yt if that helps. We've all been noobs and you're very young so it's completely understandable.

I'm put off by the low trading volumes and the fact that I have to download it.

I moved all my trading from Coinbase to Paxful a long time ago.

Paxful.com is a viable alternative as well. They don't do KYC.
@_date: 2018-04-10 09:23:27
Good job dude! Time for a switch! I recommend Paxful!
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:35:35
Yeah I read about this! It sounds like Paxful is propelling the future in places that need it the most. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:27:25
I love the animations lol
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:25:06
Not hating on Coinbase, but there are just better options for me out there. I use Paxful mostly. Haven't been there very long but I'm happy so far. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:39:00
Well he didn't say earliest, he said EASIEST. Which I agree with! 
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:44:23
Great job with this! Paxful is a great website and I hate seeing scammers ruin it!
