No buyers lining up during a sell down.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:44:41
Never tried to hide it sir. I posted it at the daily discussion on Christmas eve. I’ve got burned bad but I never blamed anyone I’ve accepted my loss and still bought BTC to hodl. I have a wallet for hodling and a few btc to trade is that so bad? 
My stop losses are from my margins and it is the maximum amount allowed I get to keep 20% of my money or less. The ones I hodl doesn’t have any stop losses it is for hodling until we reach another galaxy my friend.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:37:10
Go ahead sell your .00001btc
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:14:09
Umm no? Is it bad to ask a question? Everything is down today similar to the HOLIDAY season where everyone claims that people are just cashing out for shopping. Today is a regular day thats why I am asking if there were any big FUD news 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:32:56
We went too high so fast. I blame that
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:17:17
I’ve weathered the end of Dec massacre my margins stop loss were all hit I’ve lost all of my gains. Just curious about what is happening now. If this is just about CMC excluding bithumb then this is just plain stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:06:18
We need to call PETA, these past few weeks bitcoin had a lot of dead cats
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:50:19
That trx/btc is crazy went from 19k-14k then back 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:19:57

Goodbye brothers
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:23:39
Base it on how much bitcoins you have. You bought how many btc not $.

prepare vegeta
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:45:35
/s means sarcastic..............
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:36:50
What I hate most about these past few days is when it takes us hours to make it go up and the sellers takes it down in a few sec. the support goes away then price goes down more than it went up. The bots are playing so hard these past few weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:59:51
Here we go again. Someone sold 40btc @ 10080! Weeee
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:42:00
Bitcoin doesn’t like holidays, but this time all alts are also crashing bigger than btc so hopefully everyone buys btc after.
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:40:36
you must be making fortunes then if its easy to follow
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:23:10
obviously in order for them to retain the power/advantage, they need to limit the number of people getting rich. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:02:37
Yes but I dont think we have seen the end of it. The volume is scary. Similar to the futures start level
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:47:54
Very well noted. I will do that when it hit $1, I will sell all my BTC and sell my house when it reaches $20k again to buy more. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:45:35
stop using drugs mmkay?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:20:37
So? Will you say that if it goes back to 1k? 
“What? Bitcoin is back on the same level it was 1 year ago?”
It was 20k less than a month ago? So what is your fucking point?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:13:26
Goodbye brothers
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:03:27
I believe they are using SegWit for a long time now.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:22:56
it was nice playing with you boys. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:42:26
The rally always comes up short. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:02:14
8k or 11k? What will be the FUD today?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:00:38
Well i only lost around 15k you cant compare that to 500 million dollars if they are true hodlers. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:34:35
We need more of this! During the epic run last year the front page was full of memes. What happened to us? Did the Lambos change us boi$???
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:22:15
Not even close. We’ll be lucky to break 16k even
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:11:18
Written by Tyler Durden. Nice
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:05:57
don't put too much weight on that twitter account. the prices it indicates doesn't match okcoins price.

When is the hunting season for bears? We need to kill all of those fuckers
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:31:07
Seems like all cryptos are going down again. Hmmmmm
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:54:44
This is fucking bullshit
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:55:18
You cant argue with stupid. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:04:55
17k resistance still doing its best to hold off the bull
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:27:13
So you only read LTC?
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:07:29
What the fuck
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:50:40
Are you retarded? I replied to the one who originally posted the 3th. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:48:17
10k wheeeee
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:52:29
300btc wall about to go down
Edit: ooops
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:12:35
Just like that more than 50b of cryptos market cap hot wiped
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:05:07
Finally someone who is level headed. Thanks sir!
I’m not inciting mass sell off or what! I’m just asking what is happening cause as you can see this market is really reactionary! What is the big news now?? CMC excluding bithumb? That is fucking bullshit 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:55:59
Fair point
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:37:20
The volume is real this time. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:43:17
Hold on to your seat boys looks like we are breaking 13k but not the way we want. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:15:18
Lol not a chance. I’ve cashed out most of my initial fund. So go cry yourself to sleep hater
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:15:24
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:27:36
Are we out of the woods?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:31:59
I guess many people worked hard to make it a real bubble. Congrats to those who got rich. I got a taste of it during the peak but got greedy and lost it all. It was fun while it lasted oh well I gambled only what I can lose
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:36:12
Prepare the 12k memes
Edit: fuck spoke too soon
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:36:13
Another low volume take down. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:03:50
Are we heading below 10k?
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:27:34
what the fuck
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:27:52
Still cant finish the night green! Fuckers
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:34:19
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:13:37
looks like someone is trying to keep the price down again
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:14:03
Fucking bears thriving during winter.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:27:15
Lol  at big order
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:33:54
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:16:00
The target was 10k before end of 2017 but it went past that easily so take your bullshit somewhere else
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:14:15
Kill all the shorts!
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:12:10
Did you lose a lot of money in BTc? Trolling hard i see
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:19:14
Guys silver lining is shitcoin cash is down 30% hopefully it doesn’t recover
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:15:27
I thought yesterday was the end of this bear run. Wrong again! Fuck you bears lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:25:42
There’s too many sellers but no buyers lining up. What a rough way to start the year I’ll just stop watching and wait for next year
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:44:10
Then your comprehension is shit. The article states that a NEW exchange will add multiple crypto currency and not just adding LTC to an existing one which you are implying LTC shill boy. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:56:12
Even Roger Ver and Jihan Wu should be hurting right now. Those are big fishes and they won’t let this die. I believe this is just temporary 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:18:39
fake wall 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:21:34
Same wiped 15k usd and some of my initial money
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:06:27
The Asians woke up and started selling
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:53:27
Please don’t test 13k today
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:34:43
So? 3 weeks is long for someone who tried it first then went down instantly
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:16:08
Hopefully it won’t take too long now. Thanks for your patience keep hodling brother
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:39:24
Where’s the FUD???
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:12:47
If thats the case then they didn’t lose half. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:19:23
Like christmas all over again. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:27:55
Before it was excluded the difference was around 2k USD. Nothing drastically changed except CMC deciding to exclude all Korean exchanges for most if not all coins, it wasn’t exclusive to BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:43:38
are you fucking high? won't get to 20k again but "few bubbles that high maybe 30k at most" STFU if you don't know what you're talking about.
Enjoy HODLING your BTC that you bought ATH.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:53:50
Priced more than 10k and you consider it dead. How sad
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:40:08
This is fucking bullshit. The bears have been hovering around for months now not giving it a day of light
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:30:35
I’m an addict don’t trust me. First thing I do in the morning is wake up from a nightmare that price crashed.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:30:30
Down almost 7% at 13k btc volume. Fuck the bots
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:04:29
Volume is less than 20k. Shouldn’t even lag
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:25:19
Uhhh no?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:10:28
You cant seem to get the point. Losing half of our small holdings doesn’t compare to those amount they have. Even billionaires can feel the pinch when HALF of your holdings is gone in a few weeks. We are talking about 9 fucking digits
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:25:43
Did anyone saw the 50btc purchase
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:47:40
Be careful you will get bashed
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:46:09
Too many dead cats already. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:09:22
Yes check the 3th
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:06:25
Fake support of 160btc taken down with roughly less than 5 btc. Fucking bots
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:08:37
maybe this is really the correct price of bitcoin. fuck the sellers hope they enjoy their lambos
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:15:02
Keep trolling my friend. Haters have always been proven wrong since day one. Nothing will change that!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:35:02
I know it will. Hopefully it will be a slow and steady rise so we can ignore all the fuds. The technology has great potential  
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:49:27
Volume since yesterday is pretty low
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:26:15
NEM not Bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:57:42
We can say that to our measly holdings. But losing 9 digits hurts a lot specially with their history. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:15:23
choo choo motherfucker here comes the freight train 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:35:12
Buckle up boi$ looks like we are going down
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:53:53
Any news from the Winklevoss twins? They should be also affected imagine becoming a billionaire then lost half of its worth in a few weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:33:45
Weeeee here we go again low volume take down. Fuck you whoever you are!
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:45:40
Keep dreaming
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:24:29
Bithumb and upbit was excluded before causing a big crash a few weeks back. Now the * is gone
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:00:51
No shit sherlock
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:03:10
Lol fuck you
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:14:13
The resistance is strong
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:37:49
Volume picking up. This is different than yesterday. Another bloody day for cryptos
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:36:36
Be safe everyone! Don’t do anything stupid
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:49:09
Go take your bullshit somewhere else. I have nothing but support for ETH but people like you is destroying our common goal. Shitcoin cash is even more valuable than your ETH
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:30:53
It should go up. People will transfer asset to a safer investment like what happened to gold during the last crisis.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:18:20
i thought i saw a light at the end of the tunnel. I guess not, I just hope it slowly goes up. just stop the fucking bear
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:04:03
no not know
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:41:29
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:36:32
what the fuck is happening? 15k was reached just a few mins ago now looks like breaking to 16k
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:02:02
cool story bro
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:50:18
Sell downs started from Bitfinex 
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:31:06
Looks like it is too far gone now for 15k. Yesterday it was really hard to support the price even with small volume. Hopefully after the holidays in will go back to normal levels
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:53:20
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:59:00
East coast brothers please save us all. Let's all have a Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:13:17
Yes please! The euro bros did their part. Us asians did really poor. No support whatsoever 
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:01:32
The bots are still playing
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:16:56
Lol what a loser. You lost money on btc huh
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:06:34
Let us all make it a happy new year. Hopefully it goes back to 15-16k and stay there. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:53:34
honestly the unconfirmed transactions only clogs up when there are spammers. Right now it is slowly going down and the fees looks normal
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:38:35
Did I say we are doomed? Did I say we sell all our holdings? Quit over reacting for fucks sake. All I was saying that was a quick sell down nothing else
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:29:15
Got butt fucked in Cex Im down $500 usd in a few mins. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:22:57
my gut tells me this will be a more painful drop compared to few hours ago, but im no expert and my gut is not reliable.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:21:19
dead again fuck
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:03:19
someone is really trying hard to sell down the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:20
It’s fucking 16,200 right now in GDAX and well above other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:27:29
I did not. I was referring to the guy/group buying up a lot. I thought it was a short run but it seems like they are just pacing it up.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:16:57
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:45:00
they cancelled it just now. It will start Jan 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:40:33
The volume is really shady. Going down hundreds at a time with very little btc used
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:27:02
Lol check the chart buddy.  You call that ATH?
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:03:06
someone tried to fight the sellers too bad it was short lived =( fuck
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:33:33
What a fucking joke. It all started with the korean fud and haven’t recovered since. Im fucking dead
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:28:55
pretty crazy to watch lol. my margins are dead right now
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:58:21
Nope you didn’t lose it because you never had it in the first place
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:06:27
this kind of action I can stomach. I think I can finally sleep for a few hours before checking on my margins again.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:59:37
You can short it with cex.io
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:41:48
I don’t give a shit about your eur chart. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:32:07
Do what you want, you’re a grown man.

coinbase, coinmama, and cex.io
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:19:11
changed the title huh?
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:49:56
I’m crying myself to sleep right now bro.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:58:41
Maybe for stupid people like you
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:46:10
Aren't we too tired seeing the floor? It's time to see the new ceiling! LOL
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:24:41
how are you going to get your money from Zimbabwe? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:15:37
Do you know how much the ATH of your shitcoin is and how much it is now? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:03:27
13k and 14k we hardly knew thee
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:14:08
It was nice knowing you guys
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:08:06
good look mate
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:24:53
Please let that be the bottom. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:22:41
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:49:45
the sell down is really trying hard to succeed
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:05:23
in other news, shitcoin cash is still shit.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:42:44
I've only tried credit card withdrawal, I got the instant confirmation and got the money in 3 days
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:16:24
bubble, not bobble
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:08:48
holy shit, big fi true. hope you dont lose your job
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:30:01
this is fucking bananas! Another ride down incoming
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:03:58
moot point, you cant buy physical gold in spot prices. There are always fees to transact. So it perfectly makes sense to compare both.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:12:12
Says the guy who sold after a $75 price increase ��
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:25:15
true, 11/10 times my gut is wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:25:03
Same! Fuck the sellers 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:06:31
ditto my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:53:56
It looks like the unconfirmed transactions are slowly going down. Its currently 180k+ from 220+
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:04:32
Don’t cash out in 1 go. Do it 1-2k at a time.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:08:15
Not advertisement but providing a link with own referral code. Mmmmmkay
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:51:35
I’ve learned my lesson shorting BTC these past few days. I’d rather miss out the opportunity than bet against BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:10:48
look at the trading volume in GDAX. The trade history looks scary to watch but the volume is really thin. It seems like the computers are just scaring the market.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:21:57
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:08:51
Hopefully we get under 200k unconfirmed transactions soon
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:08:12
What the fuck?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:47:48
Sadly it got sold automatically by my shitty site. My exchange is fucking shitty but i had no choice. I got left with around 30% of what I have but most of it was profit already. Now I’m at the starting line again but not at the pole position. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:54:58
action is coming from bitfinex right now. other exchanges following
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:32:32
I’m just hoping for a normal level rise and not crash to the ground. I’m maxed out of buying more so I’m just holding what I have. Lost a ton from the recent flash crash.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:57:42
Sure buddy whatever makes you sleep at night. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:56:44
the dead cat bounced too many times today
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:09:52
holy shit the sell down got shut down!
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:09:52
not today my friend, your luck will turn around!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:58:23
Blockchain shows the backlog is slowly getting eaten up! Hopefully this will result in a positive way for the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:38:31
Credit card cash out is the fastest option from them. Confirm with them why visa payment is not available.
I have seen bad feedbacks about bank transfers from them, but with my credit card experience I got it in 3 days.

I needed a good laugh. Have an upvote
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:43:37
Cex.io allows 3x on margins both long and short is available
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:08:35
that was brutal to watch, hopefully it comes back stronger
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:01:14
okay i believe you. thats a pretty good explanation bro!
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:41:54
You call that bleeding? Maybe you bought at the top
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:51:11
Definitely looking, its been hours since we saw a proper support. Few hours ago the resistance game was strong
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:14:13

holy hell lol what a sell down 
EDIT: not everything is FUD guys. I’m holding a small BTC amount and day trading 4BTC on margins. I’m with you when it comes to ATH but don’t be too onion skinned. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:55:30
No bro, up a bit down a lot. Check it clearly, it hurts to watch whenever it goes up, the sellers easily bring the price down a few hundreds at a time.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:46:14
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:10:43
ANDDDD ITS GOING UP LOL this is really fun. too bad my exchange sucks balls. margin is full atm.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:15:50
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:05:37
he might be onto something, after coinbase cancelled the BCH:BTC and BCH:EUR the price went up instantly
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:33:32

Fucking fake support from 13900 downwards. Very small volume and yet the price is going down hundreds at a time
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:11:01
Obviously a shakedown
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:18:48
European brothers, please for the love of god protect the rise! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:45:08
I believe the fee was 1.2% + 3.80 something like that. I got the amount indicated on the withdrawal screen. No foreign transaction fee since my card is also USD. This was only for around 1,400 USD I tried it before deciding to add more. Hopefully I won't have any problem cashing out a bigger amount in the future. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:31:47
Holy fuck someone bought 200 btc

we got a badass over here boys
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:18:47
Well make sure you route your flights with planes that has wifi. I just went on an 8 hour flight, didn’t even notice the flight time thanks to GDAX and the fucking shake downs. This was a day before CBOE. I have a flight again that offers wifi a day before CME I guess I’ll do the same thing all over again.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:14:51

@_date: 2017-12-24 03:43:44
honestly i cant count how many methods of TA there is. but this one takes the cake. If I needed a TA to rely on this is it
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:36:19
Im talking about the sell down wtf are you talking about? I’m not trying to attack bitcoin don’t be too defensive. If you check the chart it went down too fast but it recovered. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:13:14
prepare for the downvotes. lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:01:42
More hashrate for BTC also. Hopefully this is a good sign for us
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:36:25
the selldown started from that fucking site. I guess it is because of their garbage tether having a tough time. Before the tether hacking they are higher than GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:47:20
Yup bought too high. Got caught in the pre Christmas massacre. The problem I have right now is my margins stop loss is very close
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:30:01
can we please see the bottom now this is becoming a sad Christmas Eve. I'm hodling though no doubt!

cex.io, only exchange allowed in my country that I know of (Philippines).
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:05:24
i got fucked by cex.io, they were constantly showing 1800 usd premium over gdax and when it shoot up to 14900, cex didnt move a muscle. fuck you @_date: 2017-12-03 12:18:38
fucking hell, it is going up in GDAX but going down in CEX.IO!
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:01:43
that was the bottom. ALL THE WAY UP!!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:14:17
the volume is really low. I'm trading on margins, when i sell 3 btc I eat up the whole 10 boxes of buy orders. and the spread sucks unlike gdax its usually just 1 cent spread with cex it is normal to see $10-$20 spread
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:59
If you didnt sell then its not lost
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:07:44

this I agree with, but sadly we cannot control what other people want to do with their holdings.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:02:20
So far BTC margins is good to me but I do have some on HODL for my future. Best of luck to you too buddy!
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:24:56
It went to 15900 immediately after the announcement check the charts and time
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:08:25
also the spread is too far off with buy and sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:48
no word from any of their social media. im freaking out now

cex.io but only 2x
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:06:36
i fucking hate cex.io but i have no choice i can only trade using their site. the 12k wall is shit only 25 BTC and not at all moving. the volume is weak

well I am more stupid to believe them. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:18:02
I was stupid enough to think that once the blockchain clears up the backlog we will have a recovery :( now its 30k+ transactions for a few days now and the dump is still continuing heavily.

what a great logic. moving to a crypto friendly location means lower pricing.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:37:51
well true. I also blame the meteoric rise, I would have preferred the slow and steady rise. I knew it was too good to be true but I got too greedy. I could have sold at the top. could have would have, life goes on.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:13:29
What a day. Clearly worse than the Christmas eve massacre
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:29:26
i'm fucking gone. goodbye 15k(money lost not entry) see you never. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:53:00
Amazing that the volume keeps rising. Long weekend for us boys
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:56:08
Sadly it goes both ways. They can also sell a whole lot :(
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:15:47
I guess tonight is the night to say goodbye for real. My margin is too low to close i wont be able to recover if i cut my losses now. I have enough to cover the fees for a few days but once my stop loss gets hit again its goodbye crypto until we hit the choo choo train again. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:06:13
Repetitive small trade sizes with a few bigger chunks here and there. A bunch of .0001 buys and sells every few seconds and surprisingly it affects the price even if its too small
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:01:10
the epic rise last november-december was just too fucking fast. I need to learn my lesson and stop buying more! I won't be too surprised if we go back to 5k because of that really really quick rise
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:13:21
Cant wait to see the graph thats shows bull trap despair etc.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:31:55

@_date: 2018-02-01 12:09:04
Lol i dont own any coin? I lost a lot during the end of the year massacre. I haven’t posted any news specially FUDS so fuck you. I am really panicking because my margins will die again hitting the stop loss 1k from now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:29:27
Just because of the India FUD. Are they really that big of a market? Wtf
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:43:14

Sunday ��������
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:36:20
Nope I just need to pay a low fee every 4 hours to maintain my option. When the stop loss hits I will be left with around 10% of the total collateral value.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:57:27
motherfucking dead cat bounce
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:28:11
Nope, a few hours ago there were a lot of 300+ buy walls that was eaten up easily. I remembered 9500 has around 320 and it took them about 2 minutes to gobble it up with real transactions not fake wall.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:36:43

@_date: 2018-02-01 10:10:25
yeah its really depressing. I am not looking to buy a lambo I just hate it when the "bubble" sayers are getting confident. I hope we don't reach 5k again
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:10:59
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:16:18
Like what?
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:20:11
no green dildos for the past hour and a half. we goin down boys. see you at 5k (hopefully not)
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:53:09
Depends how much you bought it for. If near ATH you would end up with less than half
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:13:41
Classic bull crap
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:30:46
I really hope you’re right. Ill buy more sub 5k just for old times sake. That was my first entry point around oct if i remember correctly
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:35:40
I believe that price was pre- stock split.

yeah maybe same time this year, around the BER months. OR maybe not we don't know, bitcoin is fucking schizo sometimes.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:44:16
Wow looks like the support will be broken no matter what! Let’s see if the 800 btc wall will be next in a few hours
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:12:30
wait for ATH to buy then sell again at a loss.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:39:44
Goodbye gains. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:13:02
Yes, I am prepared to lose everything and I think that will happen today or tomorrow the latest once 8k is breached. I was supposed to short it earlier but I am waiting for it to go back to 9,200 but it never went back.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:04:35
Support looks legit now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:37:39
yep, I agree
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:06:25
this isn't because of that India FUD. whoever sells because of that is stupid
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:09:45
It’s been going on for months
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:26:16
I wasn’t clear enough. I’m talking about today only so until the next FUD it should be ok
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:11:22
9500 will be tested
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:12:14
Bought price - sold price = x 
X * price you want to enter again (y)= xy
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:02:46
Yup 12 is still a good entry price if he sold for 3500 before
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:29:00
After shorting it rises FML.

@_date: 2018-02-02 01:39:29
lost my 200% gains and my initial is slowly getting killed thanks to my stupid margin moves. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:26:19
I don't know! But I will be here until that amount is worth negative. Fuck all the FUDers and wall street guys wanting to control everything. ride or die bitches
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:23:25
I thought the sellers were stopping earlier
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:34:25
Congrats! Keep on HODLing
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:56:33
I feel like the bitcoin millionaires are also cashing out big time. imagine if you have thousands of bitcoin you bought sub $100. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:33:31
Omg i laughed hard im sorry. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:24:22

@_date: 2018-02-02 09:29:18

@_date: 2018-02-02 04:57:05
48 days maybe
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:31:14
Seems strong enough, been tested a few times but the support grows bigger instead of fake walls. But this is bitcoin so we never know
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:53:55
Use your eyes. I have never seen anything like that and ive been checking gdax everyday for a minimum of 5 hours. Look at those wall unless most of it are fake
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:19:02
Bunch of fake ass walls.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:04:53
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:11:12
The only sure trading strategy that works is buy high sell low.

REMEMBER GUYS, this all started after the coinbase maintenance. It was going up right up to the scheduled maintenance then all of a sudden after an extended maintenance it all went downhill from there without brakes.
Sorry for the rants guys, it's a really bad day to trade btc right now. hopefully it gets better from here.

I know, that's what makes it more annoying. A handful of bots can ruin the price in an instant. I remembered a few days ago to the total number of coins sold was around 32k BTC and it only went up a few hundreds like it reached 10,300 or something and it fell the very next day to 9,700.

Congrats to the survivors. Looks like sub 8k is out of the question for now

If this isn’t scripted then I’m just super dumb.
Why would you dump it specially today when it is low? Last night or a few days ago it reached 9k+ hovering there for a while and all of a sudden when it was starting to slowly go down they decided to dump in bulk?

It's always like this, the low volume sell downs are more dangerous.

The support up to 8,000 is nice. Gives me more confidence that the end is near. End of bitcoin or end of the dump. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:56:55
and just like that we are back to 8600!
