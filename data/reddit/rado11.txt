if bitcoin is "popular" what about paypal etc? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:00:18
bitcoin will never be a real currency if they dont fix the fees and transaction time. i'd rather see it as digital gold.

invest right now! if one bitcoin is worth 100k-1million$ in a few years it doesnt really matter if you started at 3500$ or 5000$.
