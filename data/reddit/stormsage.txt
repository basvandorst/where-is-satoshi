Nobody was ever fined or physically forced to give them up for hoarding gold though. And those who did came out a LOT richer. Also I'd love to see the shit-storm that comes from it if they ever try to do it again.

Yes, please kick it off I unsubscribed when the banned tesla and gave pathetic excuses why.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:12:02
Isn't this exactly the kind of risk people take when purchasing bitcoin? Even if Ghash.io goes back down another will just take its spot eventually. Or better yet a group with the sum on 51% can team up and make back room deals and nobody would know...this is reminding me of some other kind of currency, i cant put my dollar on it though.

Guess who's cancelling their mastercard.

I don't think the problem is that it is crap quality here. The problem is that the are censoring technological advancements. I Unsubscribed when they banned any mention of Tesla. It's pathetic.
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:01:21
Then let it be downvoted. Censoring is the issue here. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:05:11
A personal issue with it for me is that the price isn't consistent so it's harder to keep track of what your worth really is. Even if the dollar goes down at least it is a steady decline instead of the roller coaster ride bitcoin is. It's more of a stock then a currency in it's current state.

Or rather he purchased a child with bitcoins...

My anti-virus didn't like that link

This is just stupid. Like physical dollars can't be stolen? It's not that there are just fanboys downvoting this story, it's the amount of bias that is bleeding through the article. This is from someone who has nothing to gain or lose from bitcoin as I do not own any.
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:20:40


Yeah we've heard that one before. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:27:07
If I was him I'd reactivate that dormant account with like one billion dollars and go hide out somewhere with lots of security. Honestly this is the stupidest shit ever to do to such a humble guy.
@_date: 2014-08-09 19:38:19
Avoiding the problem is not gonna fix it. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:21:01
Because money said to have value not backed by anything is so much better.
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:55:21
The problem won't be fixed if we just avoid/ignore it. This will have long term negative effects down the road. Until this issue is solved bitcoin will be more of a stock then a form of currency.

That's okay. I sold my iphone for a Android Galaxy.

I'd pull out all my funds and leave.

This site looks like shit.

Now they can have a database of your entire life and of all your purchases. Screw that. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:37:26


Gee we should get rid of all of bitcoin that will stop drug lords from getting money. It's not like there is any other thing they could use like us-dollar bills. -.-
@_date: 2014-07-24 17:27:19
And it would still be cheaper to build your own pc instead of purchasing this overpriced stuff. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:09:44
Not if it's personal opinion. At least it gives the post a chance by having a choice. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:49:43
Good luck.

God those facebook comments. I'm glad I left it when I did.

It sure acts like one. It's a major reason so many people haven't gotten into it because even though a dollar is losing value it is at least constant and slow. You know what it will be worth tomorrow as apposed to wondering what your BTC is worth every hour. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 00:35:49
Thanks going there now
@_date: 2015-07-04 00:05:44
Is that a challenge? 
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:31:27
I once mentioned in twitch chat that the streamer could open a bitcoin donation so she wouldn't have to deal with fees and charge-backs. The response I got from the chat was "Isn't that just virtual currency like WoW?" and "It sounds like a scam" I didn't bother explaining it to them since I felt it wasn't worth the effort if they are so far gone already.

It took me literally 30 seconds to uninstall it and install Deluge.

In Nevada an officer can literally stop your car, search it and if they find any cash at all for any reason just claim its drug money and seize it. When you try to complain they pretty much tell them they would spend more money in legal fees to get it back and just let it happen. The whole reason they can do that is because of an old mafia/gang related law that is so obsolete they are just using it on everyday civilians now so their office can pocket the money.

Agreed, I made a reddit account specifically to un-sub from /adviceanimals and I don't wanna be seeing it here. It should just be a rule for this sub.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:23:07
I believe its how long it takes to be verified and get everything together. Just syncing my bitcoin wallet took 2 days.

Nothing that will effect your life in any way.
