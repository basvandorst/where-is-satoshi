We are trying to obey the laws. We already obtained legal advice saying a small demonstration which does not disrupt is perfectly legal. But its hard to argue with a policeman who maybe can arrest us even if the protest was legal technically. We are trying to obtain a demonstration license.

Wow man thanks that is amazing!!! This will cover a lot of my costs. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:22:15
Well I am one of those people and it cost me about $3000 for the flight in the end (return from UK) due to not knowing my return date. BTW there's no flight from UK lower than around $1000.

Maybe you should check this week's bitcoin prices, have you been living under a rock?
It sounds like this hasn't affected you, that's great, but I'm caught in the middle of it. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:24:09
Yes mtgox is just a couple of floors, there are other companies there
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:06:46
Yes every now and then someone stops to chat, sometimes they're into bitcoin and know about MtGox and sometimes they've heard of it but don't know much about it.
@_date: 2014-02-23 05:02:43
It's not about Karpeles it's about being an anchor for the media to report something. But yes throwing stuff can be fun.
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:06:32
Our goal is to do what we can to get MtGox to do the right thing, which is get everyone back their coins and money as soon as possible, to be held accountable for their actions, to stop messing everyone around with bad customer service, stop scaring the market with notifications which people don't believe, etc etc. They're currently making a large profit from the fears of the people who they trapped in their exchange. This profit is coming out of the pockets of the trapped customers. This is not ok and by raising awareness it makes it harder for them to continue doing it.
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:36:10
Yes we need more support!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:58:44
It wasn't at 5pm yesterday, and press were there at 6pm and didn't see anyone moving.
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:56:37
thanks here is the link!
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:01:41
Yes we do see him, he has switched from walking in with a coffee/cocoa to arriving in a dark-windowed cab then rushing to the door. 
See more recent post in this thread about cerulean tower.

Have a think about the fact they continued to take people's fiat and bitcoin deposits long after it was clear those people would not be getting those deposits back. Add the (probable) illegal cash deposits they took for years because they operated an unlicensed shadow bank. And the illegal mixing of customer funds with company money in their company bank account... 
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:03:43
They were until at least 5pm and prob at least 6pm yesterday
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:25:40
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:44:24
If we thought it was as simple as that we would not be here! 
@_date: 2014-02-18 10:46:54
Because if you stand for hours in the snow without an umbrella you get very cold and wet, its bearable with an umbrella.

Small but growing protest at MtGox.  2-11-5 Shibuya,  Tokyo
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:41:15
Several people have specifically asked for QR in the pics and 1 person even generated a QR from our address so we would put it in. Why would we refuse. If the community would like to donate to fund us to stay out longer protesting (it is costing a lot of money for us to do this) or to buy us a beer or coffee as a thank-you then I think that is brilliant and I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:39:31
We'll keep this going as long as the battery lasts (should be quite a while, we have 3!)
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:45:47
What's your definition? 
I would say wearing Google Glass and live streaming out on the net is fairly cyber, but maybe that's pretty old tech to you? Maybe you could come and show us your superior tech? Why don't you sell it to the Silicon Valley giants and become a billionaire? 
@_date: 2014-02-15 05:36:08
Thanks dude... this will sort out a coffee on monday, didn't see this yesterday.
@_date: 2014-02-13 02:23:36
Bitcoin prices on MtGox are currently $502.50 which is below 50% from a couple of weeks ago. I don't know anyone who would be selling off their assets quickly at below 50% price if they weren't panicking in some way!
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:17:26
 on twitter, follow 
@_date: 2014-02-13 10:31:03
How can I cash out from mtgox? Are you actually following what we're talking about??
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:28:43
Yes, we need more help!!
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:50:41
Have you not read any of the storm of reaction to this release from the bitcoin developers and others?? Have a look.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:26:02
Not sure if you are some kind of shill or if there's something wrong with your head. 
The FSA confirmed MtGox had no license to accept fiat deposits. That means by definition what I said about unlicensed shadow bank is correct. By you saying just "a crock" do you think you are somehow making a counter argument?
If you are actually trying to convince people that MtGox are good guys looking out for their customers, you are going to have to create a new website that only allows shills and loonies on, then you might get someone to listen to you! Maybe ask Mark K for help in setting up that website, I hear he knows about security!

but cerulean tower on that floor is an office hireable by the public, we i could get a desk there for cheap and hang out. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:56:33
I haven't seen the tower and don't know yet whether the main office has moved there or not. but it would be great if it had. Being at any actual entrance makes little difference as we are there for 2 main reasons, to educate interested passers-by and as an anchor for the press.  Passers-by there will be increased a hundred fold.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:27:00
no but journalists have. apparently him and his family left a month ago. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:52:34
Sorry but you don't understand the details, we are doing it the most legal way possible.
@_date: 2014-02-13 10:41:28
Where on earth are you getting inside financial information about mtgox? 
I suspect you are making the same type of "unfounded rumour" which you are trying to denounce.
I have not made any speculation. The problem is, we don't know!
We know that a fraud has taken place against mtgox's bitcoin supply, nobody outside of mtgox knows whether the defrauded amount is higher or lower than the spare cash the company has in the bank which it can afford to lose.
@_date: 2014-03-03 11:46:49
Well they definitely seem bankrupt, I think the 22 million or so they have in the bank can be shared amongst the 750 million or so debt, but also if it is done right they should be able to claw back all withdrawals since insolvency started, that would be a LOT of money if it was years ago. Of course a huge percentage of people would refuse to pay it back. Plus I don't expect it will be done correctly, esp if fatman gets away with the civil rehabilitation. Thats why i want to get some heavy lawyers in to try to force them to do it properly. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:42:19
Congratulations, you have just won the Gox Prize! You have managed to get every assumption exactly wrong! Maybe you should apply for a job there?
The QR code was put up because many people wrote in asking for us to put it there so they could donate.
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:11:58
We weren't sure if there were still people working at Gox but now we know!  Hopefully the price will go up a bit now! 
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:12:38
Yes, it is odd. The FSA should have done something about it but they didn't and they refuse to answer anyones questions about it. Have a look at this detailed paper on it, written by someone I know who has been trying to get answers from the FSA.
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:56:55
At the moment we're not sure. The police have banned us from protesting any more outside the normal building, so we will have to work out what to do next.
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:55:48
Are you just clicking on random reply links with your eyes closed and filling the box with as much bullshit as you can in 20 seconds?
I haven't seen so much "brainpuke" in a long time, and clearly my responding with logic and reason just makes you worse. Goodbye, weirdo.
@_date: 2014-02-18 10:56:35
Pretty unlikely that that's the answer!! In the case that there's not the bitcoins it would empty the company, in the case that there is the bitcoins it would empty the company. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 10:50:24
We pre-empted being thrown off, but now they come out quite often to check we're not even touching the edge of the kerb.
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:27:04
Yes, thats why we need more help! 
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:42:28
Ah we tested the original from my screen and it seemed ok, I guess the imgur copy may not be so clear 
@_date: 2014-02-15 06:29:25
Let me get this straight. Your point is that if someone uses a business which in some way screws them over, it's their own fault because we are in a free market??
And surely if you COULD care less that means you do care about it? 
Not sure whether you are as stupid as you sound or are messing with me. 
If you don't care about the protest, why exactly are you on this page making comments about it? 
@_date: 2014-02-15 06:42:38
good idea i will try to sort that out
