Yeah it means "let it be done" in Latin.  Third sentence of the bible contains *fiat lux*: "let there be light" (let light be done/made).
With fiat, the government is saying "let it be so".  Worried about how much gold or silver you can get for your money when you trade it in?  Don't worry about it.  The money is worth what we say it's worth.  It's five bucks because we say it's five bucks.  *Let it be*.

It's pretty clear now that you used a horrible example.
I mean let's look at the obvious thing.  The thing you ignored.  And you ignored it for a reason, and I will discuss that later.
You ignored the fact that language is extraordinarily difficult to learn.  You learn your native tongue as a baby because baby's brains can absorb that shit like a sponge but when you grow older, you need *thousands* of hours of study to even be able to converse at a preschooler's level.  
I can *literally change $30 of my bitcoin into dogecoin or litecoin or whothefuckcarescoin within a half hour*.  If I view it as beneficial to me, I would do it.  Language you are born into, it becomes a part of your identity, all social interaction.  This is why conlangs can't take over largely spoken natural languages.  There's a *huge* barrier of entry here.  Languages can only be taken over by other languages which people are born into, rely on, need to communicate in to survive, of communities large enough to take over the other language's community.
But you ignored this. Why?  Why didn't you respond to people's criticisms of your shitty analogy?  It amazes me why people come on reddit and do this.  They give an analogy with a *humongous* flaw, and I mean a flaw that *everyone* who sees it will identify in seconds. I promise you everyone here thought of it. And you did too, *and if you disagree, you're a liar*.  So why did you write this shit anyway?  What is the point of that?  Can you actually explain why?  And if not, can you apologize?
I mean if economics is a science, you should use *scientific, logical reasoning*.  But you just *refused* to do that.  Just because.

I said that, stop defending yourself on that point. I know, *I get it*.  
The problem isn't that you're defending drunk driving.  It's that you oppose making it illegal to drive drunk given that the person hadn't victimized anyone yet, because you appear to think a potential should never be made illegal because potentials don't kill, actions kill.  
This is problematic because it does nothing to curb the problem and instead shifts the responsibility to people who are already, in the moment, being irresponsible.  If society as a whole took up this philosophy then driving drunk would increase drastically and society would be at a net loss.  
It has the feature that many libertarian beliefs have, which is that it operates in a magical fairy land where humans instantly act more rationally for no real reason and the world is better.  In reality, deaths through driving drunk would skyrocket.

I...couldn't disagree more.  How can anyone think that?
First, there is very little consumer choice when it comes to roads.  There is some, yes, but you are *highly* limited.  Consider Las Vegas. There are perhaps 8 or so roads out of the Las Vegas area, and all of them are headed in completely opposite directions. Only one heads towards Los Angeles...any other route you take via road would take *significantly* more hours, because we are talking hundreds of miles of distance.  
Whoever owns that road has absolutely no competition, you *have* to take that road.  So there is no free market there.  He will have no incentive to enforce drunk driving laws.  Hell, it would be very expensive for him to do so, since he has hundreds of miles to cover with employees patrolling.  And it's highly unlikely someone would pay thousands (millions?) of more dollars building a road parallel to the other one, because that is a *lot* of money to only get half the traffic.  Since it'd be highly competitive, their prices are going to be identical but they are also going to cut down on security and patrols (and if one banks on "we are safer because we banned drunk driving!'), the cheap people are going on the cheaper road because that's all they can afford.
Mind you that is a reductio absurdum, which is not a logical fallacy but shows where your logic will lead.  The same thing will happen all over the country, since people will choose to go the quickest/cheapest route, and road-owners will decide to enforce their drunk-driving rules differently, many not at all.
Additionally, bars would have no incentive to not over-serve patrons.  Currently they do; it's against the law and they can be shut down.  It's not like they're going to lose a ton of customers either.
I love how you just take a concept and just outright assume that a big problem isn't going to exist *any more, to any extent whatsoever* because of it.  The free market is like a magician that can just will away any of society's ills. 
"If we had a free market, pollution wouldn't exist!  I don't know what crazy solution the free market will come up with, but I can assure you it will!"
"If we had a free market, there'd be no more rape!  I can't really tell you how, since the free market is magical, but I assure you sociopathic rapists will no longer exist!"
Additionally, drunk driving was significantly reduced after increased government laws and public ad campaigns.  Back in the 70s, drunk driving was a sorta irresponsible thing people did but cops didn't arrest you for.  When my father was a teenager, they drove drunk all the time, and if the cops see you they usually ignored the beer in your hand unless you were fully plastered.  Then they'd throw you in jail for the night with no lasting consequences.
However, after the government stepped into it, drunk driving became highly stigmatized and therefore reduced significantly.

It's not an argument; I just don't see how you can say with a straight face that bitcoin will probably outlast every current government.  How could *anyone* be so sure of that?  Bitcoin is almost virtually untested.  You are *way* too sure of bitcoin based off nothing.
This isn't me saying that bitcoin won't be successful--I have money in bitcoin.  But you said there is a greater than 50% chance that bitcoin will outlast over 200 governmetns, which is an objective, empirical claim.  
It's like having a baby and declaring that "he has pretty good genetics, he will probably end up being a professional athlete".  *Waaaaay* too soon to tell, by far.

Yeah, see, languages don't really "converge", is my point.^*  Instead what happens is that big languages overtake small languages.  We see that happening with native american languages etc, but we are also seeing major languages, like English, slowly diverging into other languages.  This is *amongst people who are very well connected via the internet*.  So I'm at *all* convinced that this is happening.
^* I mean they kinda influence each other sometimes, but its not as if two small languages combine their grammar to become one language.

I don't think the skeptics are saying it can't be used as a currency at *all*.  They're saying it won't work out as a currency long-term.

Proto-Indo-European diverged to [all these dozens of languages](  I'm not sure why everyone is saying that language will converge to one language.  Languages tend to diverge.  Like a family tree.  What "converges" languages is language death.  
Even English, the most global language, is slowly diverging into other languages, one of the most notable of which is AAVE (which, while disregarded as "lazy english" is developing a complex tense and aspect system and undergoing significant phonological changes) as well as other local pidgins around the world.

The government owns property and I certainly agree that it should be able to set rules according to how people use that property to a certain extent.  That is, I'm fine with it if they forbid you from swimming in the Reflection Pool at the National MAll.
However, treating the government the same as any other property owner is foolish, because they're not any other property owner.  US citizens do pay for those parks, and they are public land, so we should be able to have far more freedoms there than a privately owned park.  More than just freedom of speech.  If a man banned all Steves from his privately-owned park, well, kinda douchey, but perfectly legal.  If the government did that, then it's far over-reaching their rights.
There are much more valid reasons for drunk driving laws to be enforced than "the government owns it".  Safety reasons, essentially.
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:56:54
Diverging means that one language will turn to two or more.
Converging means two languages turning into one.  But that means that the originals won't exist anymore.
Language death is the reason why there aren't a million languages, and yes it happens all the time.  My overall point is that even the language that most people are most likely to speak soon (English) is diverging into a bunch of languages anyway.  Same thing happened to Latin.  So it's unlikely that we would ever end up with one language, because that language will "Break up" before that state.


Evolution with language, just like with animals, works through divergence.  A group of birds of species A get stranded on an island, they will eventually diverge from A into species B. Species don't really converge.

That's a horrible analogy.  Fantasizing about punching someone in the face can *not* hurt anyone by any stretch of the imagination.  Drunk driving *can* hurt someone, and quite often does.  My father, for example, was hit by a drunk driver on his bike.  
Why did you choose to use such a shitty analogy?  I find it hard to believe you actually thought that was an apt analogy.  But you chose to use it anyway. *Why*?  Not to belabor it, but I don't understand why people speak with such confidence when they use arguments they *know* everyone can see through.
That said, I do sorta agree with you that a victim doesn't exist until someone is actually hurt (define hurt as you will).  People are getting into semantics about it.

Christ, that's a little extreme.  Shows are allowed to make a few mistakes.  That's be like if I quit the show because the command line sequences in episode one made no sense (and they really didn't).  However, they fixed those mistakes, and other scene's command lines were accurate.
Sometimes shows have to change reality or have plotholes in order to make the plot work.  Virtually *every* show and movie does this, even the very good ones.  Usually only the experts tend to notice these.  Elliott doesn't use the darknet markets because he needs to use Shayla who needs to use Vera, which later on in the season creates a lot of conflict.  
For what it's worth, Elliott does know about the darknet, and its marketplaces.  He mentions one in the very first scene in the show--except that it's CP, not drugs.  And for what it's worth, he's a very paranoid person, so maybe he thought it was unacceptably risky to use the darknet.

Wikipedia puts it best:
The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (officially Swedish: Sveriges riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne, or the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel), commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics,[1] is an award for outstanding contributions to the field of economics, and generally regarded as the most prestigious award for that field.[2]
The prize was established in 1968 by a donation from Sweden's central bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, on the bank's 300th anniversary.[2][3][4][5] Although it is not one of the prizes that Alfred Nobel established in his will in 1895, it is referred to along with the other Nobel Prizes by the Nobel Foundation.[6] Winners are announced with the other Nobel Prize winners, and receive the award at the same ceremony.[2]
And, and this is very important:


The nomination process and selection criteria is the same.
It is, for all intents and purposes, a nobel prize.
Secondly, I want to point out that:
*Nominations for nobel prizes are meaningless*.
Both Hitler and Stalin were nominated for a nobel peace prize.  Why?  Because there are (tens of?) thousands of people who are able to nominate anyone they want.  With so many people able to nominate, it happens that a few loonies/unconventional people are nominated every year.  
The fact that Satoshi was nominated is near-meaningless, and is not newsworthy. Not even on this subreddit.  It's not like when a hollywood movie is nominated for an academy award.

I'm not sure you understand the point of my comment.  I'm saying the phenomenon of memes needs to be nipped in the bud, not "the subreddit".  That doesn't make any sense to me.


The fact that you are calling normal moderation "fascist" indicates that you're not a very serious person and not worth my time arguing with.  As a mod of a default, any tiem the moderators introduce a new policy or even do something like ban someone for ranting on against "the niggers", we get called fascist.  It's not a serious argument.  Perhaps instead of "fascist", you can use the term "stricter" or even "too strict" instead?  Cause I'm pretty sure we're not assassinating political dissidents here.
the advantage is that this is the main bitcoin subreddit, and is therefore the face of bitcoin on reddit.  


Until more people started joining.  Small communities work well with few rules.  The bigger they get, the worse they get.  When became a default subreddit, the amount of total bans *doubled* that same day.  


Thus why we need to nip the problem in the bud.  The more people the join, the more people comfortable with the current set of rules and permissive atmosphere, and the more upset they'll get if the mods become more strict.  Look what happened when became strict.  Utter shitstorm.
Stop the problem now and the children will complain for a little bit.  Stop the problem later and they'll try to dox you.

Eh we all make mistakes.  A spelling error isn't a big deal but when someone makes it multiple times in a row I feel like it's the polite thing to mention it.

But atheism is *not* opposed on reddit.  Most people here on this site *are* atheists, and a large percentage are anti-theists as well.
Just because a community is *for* an oppressed group--which I agree atheists *are*--that doesn't automatically mean the community is good. Some examples are the Nation of Islam, and certain extremist feminists.  
*is* a horrible community.  It's a horrible community because it is very anti-intellectual while simultaneously being extremely condescending and engaging in stereotypes.  has *severe* community problems it has to work out.  And that has nothing to do with *atheists*, it has everything to do with people who do not understand how to argue their point in an intelligent way.
And Jesus fuck, talk about a persecution complex.  You may be picked on for being an atheist in some situations in real life, but you are *not* being "circled by gangs" for being an atheist on the Cultural Internet.  You are actually far more likely to be "oppressed" for being Christian on the Cultural Internet than for being atheist, and I say this as an antitheist.

Fascist with two S's.
And my point is to stop abusing loaded terms like that, because that makes you look like a fool.

Majority of reddit is full of idiots who upvote anything that has macro text.  Every other subreddit that has tried to appeal to the majority has turned to shit, because the majority has shitty tastes.  There are also many other problems with allowing memes, such as the fact that *most* of them are highly simplified stereotypes which drive away people of dissenting viewpoints, they drive away *intelligent* and *serious* people, *and* in the time it takes to read, vote, and comment on a serious article, you could read and vote on 50 memes, which leads to them taking over the front page.
Point of a moderator is to define the rules of a community, driving the parameters of it.  Through their rules, the community establishes a proper atmosphere and the community starts self-enforcing.  If it's "let the people decide", well, you get things like youtube comments.

is already the main bitcoin subreddit.  Go make instead.


The children are making bitcoin seem less appealing to the more serious people, which makes *all* investors of bitcoin suffer, if only a little.  Fuck off with your "rift"; people only bitch about mamays being banned only after the community had been attached to them for a while to such a point that the more serious people already left and had been replaced by the hordes of idiots.  This is what happene dot Nip it in the bud.

If you think that or are "shitty and fascist" then you're the type of person they don't want there, and I agree.  


I don't get the joke (having been paying attention to bitcoin recently).  Maybe it's the joke of the century, but I don't see why it can't be posted on another subreddit.

Subreddit discovery is horrible.  The reason why these splinter-communities have so few subscribers is because most people don't even know they exist.  Even if it's in the sidebar people are too lazy to read that so they *still* don't join.

As I said numerous times, the main subreddit should be the default one, because that's the face of bitcoin on reddit.  Memes are the thing that deserves to be sidelined, not seriousness.
