I only touched on three of the 6 suggestions made on the referred post. But I think I gave my own perspective on these three and with that made my contribution to elucidate and educate as much as is currently in my radius of influence about the potential for the technology and infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to be of real value to Businesses, Investment advisers or the public at large and for this to gain further and further momentum into the future.

Great Stuff.
''In order to avoid any risks associated with the volatility of Bitcoin, users have the option to peg their loans to the Bitstamp exchange rate. This allows them to be denominated in some fiat currency so that borrowers will not suddenly owe huge amounts of money if the Bitcoin exchange rate spikes while they are in debt.''

To be honest at this time of writing I don’t know exactly how the venture of SolarCoin is doing… But given that the process of converting renewable energy creation in a monetary credit is something of a widespread appeal and deeply consensual I can only see good reasons to the venture to succeed…. And let us not forget that Bitcoin mining is a process that wastes energy… So this might be another way of slashing the energy costs and environmental damage that was already done….:

What we are witnessing here is the major shifts and transformations in the Financial Industry’s ways of doing business and a maybe dramatic need for the Industry to adapt to these new times, with different business models and the progressive, but rapid and decisive need to integrate new technologies to its legacy structures. Even if Digital Currencies aren’t going to play a major role in this, what is certain is that they have already made their fair share of contribution to shake up and start revolutionise this very important Industry.

The banking industry in the UK has the ability, the knowledge and is robust enough to support Bitcoin development without any fear or issue. Politicians will see in this just another vindication of UK status as World Leader in Financial Innovation.

On another front of the adoption battle there are still some questions on the way smartphone and tablet users use their devices in a situation where they might only have the device as their wallet. After all not all commercial business accepts Bitcoin and have the proper incentive to do so. There are some ideas and applications emerging to address this problem and a hope that more ideas and ventures entering this space might lead to massive increase in adoption.

I would agree with the idea that a full fledged adoption of any business to the open-source decentralised paradigm will probably be a slow process and with its limitations, with the obvious high probability of adoption with businesses that rely on a network of variables, be it clients or factors of production or any other variable, and also with businesses that are technology intensive and not traditional in their inputs. But the impact in the overall economy is and will hardly be something which any business will overlook at a light and negligible cost.

I hope that the audience of Coinfinance (as well as of Digital Ventures) enjoy this Post as much as I did for the richness of links and for the promise of a nice set of further additions to the knowledge of, on the one end the important Economic Issue of Monetary Systems, and on the other hand the emergence of phenomena like Digital Currencies.

''Bitcoin, the first technology that enables decentralized consensus, will permit people everywhere to associate freely with their fellows. Stateless decentralized crypto-currencies will create an environment where many different communities can co-exist and foster a society within which people create value together, based on each person’s affinity and voluntary association.''

If cryptocurrencies or the block chain technology are going to disrupt the Banking industry or not, the dispute will continue for some time. But if the human behavior side of the equation is an important factor, it is more on the cultural side of things that problems will emerge. On technological and competitive side there will more and more pressure the change things for the better. With actions or quality research.

''Going into 2015, blockchain technology is going to move out of its original money-related beginnings into new ideas that may not as yet have been envisioned. And to answer the question raised in the title of the article, it [the use of the bitcoin blockchain] will change the way we interact with databases in the future. It will require the learning of new methods of programming, new approaches to contracts, business processes and even governance itself. The onus, therefore, is on professionals to begin moving into the emerging brave crypto world.''

In conclusion from this interesting argument about the issue of the block size limit, its proposed increase to address scalability and network security concerns will not resolve those issues. Miners fees will be determined by the market and the market cannot be influenced by changes to the Bitcoin protocol. There will have to be found some other way or measure to address network security concerns.
