We're in talks with a couple wholesale gift card suppliers, but I can't really go into more detail. Definitely exploring that angle to supplement inventory.
@_date: 2016-08-20 19:31:30
I do- we were bit pretty hard by that, in fact.
Unfortunately, from what I've seen, much of what differentiates their API isn't just the design, but the uptime, etc.
@_date: 2016-08-20 19:36:36
Thanks! Once we make a little more progress on the inventory tech, rates should improve across brands.
@_date: 2016-08-21 20:34:07
You can actually do both! Just bring another card or use the Starbucks app in tandem, and ask the barista to put the rewards on the second card.
@_date: 2016-08-20 15:55:44
This hasn't been much of an issue. The bigger problems are inventory management. We have a two-sided service where we need sellers for every buyer. Right now, we have both, but the tech in the middle matching them has been a bottleneck. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 19:35:34
Working on it! The balance check inconsistencies are high priority for us- they're also intimately tied to inventory availability.
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:43:16
The URI in the interface is a standard bitcoin URI. If you figure out whether there's a Copay-specific URI, we'd be happy to include that to make it easier for you. You can probably find out by opening an issue on their GitHub. As the sibling comment points out, we can't spend a ton of time on Windows-specific fixes, but happy to make changes the improve the cross-platform wallet experience.
As I said, we aren't dead- but our inventory goes fast, and it's typically loaded early in the day Pacific Time, so I could see how folks in the UK might not get good access. Once we've got these infrastructure improvements in place, there will be better availability.
@_date: 2016-08-20 19:37:18
I didn't realize they never accepted bitcoin for them! :D
@_date: 2016-08-20 15:53:44
Hey, founder here.
We're alive! The team is working on new infrastructure to support the next few brands and improve our inventory process. Starbucks inventory has suffered in the meantime, since we don't have the bandwidth to focus on both.
So if you only buy Starbucks from us- yes, service is degraded, and we haven't done a great job communicating why. The blurb about checking on Twitter should actually read something like "We're out of inventory, and will have more soon." There are cards available throughout the week, but they go pretty fast.
I'll put together a blog post explaining the situation soon, with some possible mitigations (eg we could turn off refunds, and should be able to improve inventory availability) and a timeline for the improvements. If you've signed up for our mailing list, we'll also post an update there.
We are still selling Target cards via Airbitz, and will soon add Home Depot to the list as well. It sounds like you're an international user, so I understand you care less about those brands, but many of our users are excited about saving money groceries and other home goods.
Hope that explains it, and happy to answer any questions!
@_date: 2016-08-20 17:27:39


We're excited! Though we can't claim to be the first- I think Gyft had it for a few days. :/
The work we're doing now  is all about inventory management, and supersedes even new brands getting launched. We're also in talks with wholesale providers
to use as a fallback in case we're low (eg no discount when we're low, but there will always be cards).
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:28:19
Thanks for the feedback, but our issue isn't too few users or too little volume. It's not being able to service the demand we already have. We've stopped all marketing until we can break through the monthly ceiling we hit.
I do agree we need to be more communicative for our current users and fans, but that's not about promotion.
@_date: 2016-08-20 17:36:39
Is this a feature request or a test of our loyalty? :)
Really though, we're focused on inventory and availability until our issues are resolved. We've considered supporting other assets (love what and co have done with ShapeShift), and ETC has caught my eye, but inventory &gt; new features.
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:14:11
It worked out well for Starbucks. And Walmart actually has a significant financial service offering for underbanked customers.
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:06:06
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:05:09
That doesn't work with private companies, regardless of whether you demand it... :/
@_date: 2016-08-20 22:30:14
We wanted it to be the third brand, but the market for Whole Foods cards is really seasonal, and seems to dry up frequently. We don't want a repeat of the inventory issues we're having now, so it's going to land after Walmart.
@_date: 2016-08-21 03:32:16
Maybe, but that's not likely, and would come with a ton of strings attached.
@_date: 2016-04-21 00:04:08
@_date: 2016-08-20 17:20:05


Well as long as you're sure :)


Again, I agree we need to be more communicative.
@_date: 2016-04-30 06:30:10
FWIW, we were back! We just had our inventory immediately sacked. We were focusing on small denominations so more people could use the service, but users just started buying up all the available inventory. Still kicking around how best to spread the discount love, since we want to move volume but also have as many happy customers as possible.
@_date: 2016-04-30 06:30:59
Other people's unused gift cards. Eg via another product of ours, cardforcoin.com
@_date: 2016-04-18 20:59:14
Just logged in and saw this- could you either PM me or send it to support
Sorry for the slow response, I need to set up Reddit notifications or something..
@_date: 2016-04-30 06:28:20
@_date: 2016-04-30 06:27:06
Hey, founder here. We've been up and down for the last week, but the issue is nearly settled.
We'll publish a blog post, but quick recap is that we've had inventory issues, and are making changes to the system to handle those going forward. In particular, we're going to always have cards on hand for a worse discount, instead of just being "out". This goes for Starbucks, as well as Target via Airbitz and other brands moving forward.
Happy to answer any questions here.
@_date: 2016-04-30 06:31:31
Hm, other gift card exchanges might disagree.
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:04:35
Next are Home Depot and Walmart. Both have the core transfer / balance pieces finished, but are waiting on the new infrastructure to launch.
Re: precise amounts- doubtful. It's a cool feature, but the same business model that let's us offer discounts above eGifter (by buying secondary market cards) makes loading a card with a specific amount difficult.
@_date: 2016-04-30 06:27:58
We're working on plugging in other exchanges for liquidity to cover this situation. Basically, if we're low on cards they'll just be pulled from the next best exchange.
@_date: 2016-04-18 21:00:14
Thanks Eric. Looking forward to catching up some time, hope you're doing well!
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:49:03
The wallet doesn't support it yet. Yes, it's odd as a spectator given the rhetoric, but the node and wallet are different.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:48:12
Yes, they're thieves. In a fully consenting transaction, that you agree to upfront, using a push-based payment mechanism. /s
Cut the bullshit- if you don't like it don't use them.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:37:50
Founder here. Sorry for the slow response- I worked through the weekend trying to catch up on holiday support, and I'm not done yet.
We definitely still allow 0-conf- this was a mistake on our end. I'll follow up via support and get this resolved.
next coffee is on us!
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:30:37
We're doing just fine :) The Airbitz integration &amp; Target beta brought a bunch on new users, and we're working to crank up support.
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:51:15
We [launched it with Airbitz]( so just download Airbitz and give it a try! We're still working on better discounts (we just offer 3% off right now), as well as our own web app version.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:41:07
Thanks for checking on this- it saved me some time :) 1 gold star
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:06:54
Nevermind, I see it- looks like it's nearly processed.
@_date: 2015-12-23 03:16:58
@_date: 2015-12-17 02:43:36
This is.. well, FUD. I've addressed it elsewhere, but if we buy cards that were obtained fraudulently, we're left holding the bag when the card is deactivated. So in addition to the obvious reasons we'd work to fight fraud, there's also our unit economics, and profit.
There are a ton of reasons to sell your old gift cards. The company started because I had a bunch of extras from family sitting around, sold them, and started buying from friends.
(Posting this on a train, please excuse the brevity!)
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:16:11
No, the users *aren't* left holding the bag. If a card gets deactivated or was otherwise found to be fraudulent, we're the ones who take a loss.
Try the app or do a little research before you make claims like that.
@_date: 2015-12-16 20:30:24
It doesn't mean much. We've had conversations with them in the past, but we are in no way affiliated or partnered, nor have we asked them to bless our work.
We work similarly to other gift card exchange services. We don't seek permission from merchants, since we're buying their gift cards on the secondary market, and re-selling them ourselves.
As to being shut down- so far, the law has been on the side of gift card resellers. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 02:51:30
The app depends on the details of the local merchant's payment system. Starbucks cards from the US work in a ton of other countries, so most of those were free for us.
As we grow we'll be more focused on international support. The biggest missing pieces are money for the dev time and boots on the ground (we can't fly everywhere, but often users will volunteer to do testing in their countries). Sorry I don't have an ETA for you yet, but we'll get there!
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:03:33
Hey, founder here.
You didn't get scammed- as you can see from my comment history lately, I'm just overwhelmed with support lately. If you PM me your ticket number I'll try to expedite.
Thanks, and sorry for the trouble!
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:36:10
Hey, not sure what article you're referring to, but we do not work *with* Starbucks. AFAIK, the most I've said is that they're aware of us. Do you have a link handy? I want to make sure that's corrected.
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:03:51
We'll have an update this week!
@_date: 2015-12-22 08:57:27
Awesome. Check back often- the denominations / discount are in pretty serious flux.
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:57:02
Hey, have you emailed support? And if so, do you have a ticket number? I'll make sure it's taken care of.
We've been making some changes on the tech side to improve stability and speed. We're still dealing with some growing pains, but we'll be through them soon.
@_date: 2015-12-28 22:27:02
Do you mean in your case, or this one? Tx's don't disappear, but before a confirmation they can be malleated or double-spent.
@_date: 2015-12-23 23:23:27
Not sure you meant to make this public?
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:38:26
Seconded. We appreciate the enthusiasm on ATOMBIT's part, but we weren't a part of putting that together.
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:54:00
Hey! It's very much "up to 10%"- we're still working on more robust volume / discounts for Target. The discount should be 4-5% over the next few days, and we're hoping to get in the 6-10% range in 2016.
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:28:58
Founder here. Sorry about the trouble!
It's not an issue affecting other users AFAICT- most people seem to be unaffected. We're working to catch up on the support queue- DM me your details and I'll see what I can do.
@_date: 2015-12-22 08:59:53
Nope, just struggling to keep up with the support queue. It's mostly been me on support while the guys push out new features and stability improvements, and I haven't been enough since our latest expansion. I'll see what I can do about this.
Aside, an admission- the screen caps actually make it harder on our end. We can't copy/paste deposit addresses and whatnot from screen caps, so it takes way longer to do support. I came up with a snippet to OCR some of them but the accuracy isn't always good enough.
@_date: 2015-12-17 02:34:15
If you scan your card after you use the app and ask your barista to put the rewards on that account, you can double-dip :)
@_date: 2015-12-17 02:46:07
Hey, thanks! And please don't think I was screening you- I've just had too much on my plate for... well a while hah
@_date: 2015-12-23 06:55:33
The Target beta launched with our [in-wallet Airbitz integration]( we're still working on the web version. If you want to give it a try, just download Airbitz and go to "buy / sell / spend bitcoin".
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:52:47
Sorry about that, working on it! Let me know if you don't hear back soon.
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:41:30
Hey! We don't typically do cards via email, and I haven't seen one from you? We're definitely not scamming, we just sell out really quickly and occasionally get taken down by fraudsters ourselves.
What email did you use?
@_date: 2014-08-23 13:58:43
We're a payments company, not a gift card company- so it's a much more focused checkout experience. We also offer pretty serious discounts compared to Gyft.
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:46:25
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:36:03
Yeah I'm starting to see that.
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:32:10
Oh I know exactly how to do it, and securely for the owner. Just concerned about legal &amp; TOS- we'll have to think about the ramifications.
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:17:24
The bar codes are the same you'd get for an e-card, and the generation is similar to how other e-gift providers (Gyft, CashStar) work. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 18:48:08
We just re-opened Starbucks, but you've sold us a number of bad cards. Unless you have a compelling explanation, we're going to have to stop accepting your cards :/ Sorry.
@_date: 2014-09-09 13:14:22
I've checked again. The cards have gone bad. Maybe you're getting scammed by whoever is providing you with the cards? Sites like cryptothrift, etc are usually not a good idea.
@_date: 2014-08-02 14:14:56
There are cookies too! :P
@_date: 2014-04-12 21:23:24
We need to add every Starbucks location in the US... 
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:25:34
...aannnnd we're back. We've reopened the site for a short pilot, supporting both bitcoin and dogecoin payouts. Let us know what you think.
@_date: 2014-08-10 00:53:12
We're working on a solution for the successor app,  Initially we'll have an optional intermediate to speed up payments, though we're paying close attention to multisig.
@_date: 2014-07-24 15:34:21
We're testing Amazon right now. Starbucks should be back up soon as well.
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:48:11
Just updated the copy, thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:58:23
You should be able to click past that, no?
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:32:27
Yep, we're working on this while the lawyers figure everything out with the original product.
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:20:05
Repeat business? Legal repercussions? What stops Amazon from stealing your CC?
That said, mostly my reputation. I want this to succeed / don't want to be a scumbag.
@_date: 2014-08-09 23:29:34
I'd be stoked if we could get Kroger, but they don't have the right hardware for it. Maybe there's another popular regional that has e-cards and scanners for payment?
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:31:40
Great idea! Adding it to the list.
ADDENDUM - I don't want to make the process too difficult- I think keeping it simple has been pretty successful so far- but I bet escrow would help adoption with more experienced folks.
@_date: 2014-08-10 00:48:20
I'm working on this now- sorry about that!
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:01:31
:( Coinbase is having an issue with their payment page. We're looking forward to removing our dependency on them.
@_date: 2014-08-23 20:57:18
coinforcoffee.com doesn't have a referral program. I believe cardforcoin.com pays out 5% on a users first trade.
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:29:47
Sent! Let me know if you have any other trouble.
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:36:21
The rate changes, but it's between 60-70%. Sorry about that, I'll try to make it clearer in the copy.
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:35:39
It's more an issue of whether the card will be accepted.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:29:11
We've refunded him via Coinbase, but he refuses to claim the wallet :/
@_date: 2014-09-02 17:04:04
Our business model naturally gives us access to USD, so... yeah. BitPay is great, but we'd like finer-grained control and a less-centralized option.
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:57:17
That's the idea. I get a ton for Christmas every year but I'm not a big Starbucks fan.
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:23:32
Technically? Yep, though it starts getting into weird territory from a legal perspective. More likely we could add an option to buy a card, without an expiration, and you could merge it with your own if you wanted. Let me think a bit about this-  I imagine we can come up with something. I also need to get an idea how many users this would help, so I'll keep an ear open for similar use cases.
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:31:15
Checking it out now.
@_date: 2014-08-23 20:54:59
Oh, my mistake- I thought that comment was on the parent. I know the folks at Purse are working hard to fight fraud, but I don't know the details.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:06:21
Hey guys, for those of you who don't know me- I'm Matt Luongo, co-founder and CEO of Card for Coin- makers of cardforcoin.com and coffee.foldapp.com (nee coinforcoffee.com).
We're looking to raise a bit of capital to take cardforcoin.com to the next level, and increase our weekly volume. This is our second business loan on BTCJam- the [first successful loan]( got us excited about the platform, and the idea of partnering with the community to grow.
If you have any questions about the loan, our business, or anything else, let me know!
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:24:40
Try it if you want- we aren't sure it doesn't work, we just don't want to disappoint people. I know it works in Canada, and I've had a UK starbucks card work here, so maybe.
@_date: 2014-05-27 02:35:15
Ah, looks like confusion due to our poor copy. We're resolving this over PM.
@_date: 2014-08-10 01:35:41
Nope. We buy them at a discount (we run cardforcoin.com as well).
@_date: 2014-08-02 14:13:49
The next version (foldapp.com) will have a wallet you can pre-load for instant payments. We might port it back to coinforcoffee.com if there's demand.
@_date: 2014-09-02 17:46:54
Correct. And to be clear, that's because we resell them elsewhere- it's not a 20% fee or anything. If you compare us to GiftCardZen or another popular gift card exchange, I think we're offering the most for Amazon cards right now.
@_date: 2014-08-02 14:12:28
Weird. Was it a franchise or a regular Starbucks? That puts Switzerland and HK as the only two locations we've seen that don't work.
@_date: 2014-08-24 23:57:46
Yes it does! We're undergoing maintenance right now but we'll be back up early this week. Give it a try.
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:09:05
What rate works for you? Reselling on gift card exchanges for USD runs ~30%, though you can do better on ebay (but you have to ship, slower, etc). I'm looking for ways to go lower.
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:00:26
We're looking at Whole Foods and other groceries as well. Gas is tricky because we work by giving you a barcode to scan, and most people pay for gas at the pump. Do you think you'd go in to spend bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:04:58
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:00:50
We've seen it used in Canada and the UK, as well as China and parts of France. It's still USD-denominated, but the barcode works regardless (just like Starbucks cards work internationally).
@_date: 2014-09-04 12:43:29
Cards can go bad later- and yours have. Happy to continue this discussion over email or PM.
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:05:41
We give users new card numbers to accomplish some of the reloading / refunding securely- we don't put money onto a card you already have. Since we never expose the pin, there's not really a way to transfer the card's balance on to your own card to get the rewards.
FWIW though, 10% off is better than their rewards program, which I've been told averages out to 8.7%.
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:33:56
What browser are you using? It seems to work in Chrome
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:35:35
A couple reasons. Bitcoin can go up- Amazon can't. r/giftcardexchange has plenty of people selling their Amazon cards for 80% the value in PayPal as well.
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:26:50
Who do you like? Indie shops are tough- I'm still looking for a technical solution there because of the disparate systems- but we're looking at other chains (eg Peets) in the nearer term.
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:42:37
Starbucks works in Canada! 
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:51:32
I can't figure out how to replicate the issue :/ I'm happy to run your card myself via DM if you'd like.
@_date: 2014-09-05 23:26:57
Hey, so multiple cards of yours have later been deactivated by Starbucks after we've bought them. They typically do this after a card has been found to be fraudulent. We've lost money on your cards, so we can't keep buying them.
This can happen if you buy cards off shady sites like, eg, cryptothrift.
@_date: 2014-09-02 17:42:19
Hey, one of the founders here. It depends on the card. For Amazon card, we're currently offering 80%. For Starbucks, we're offering something like 53%, and for Target, 82%.
You can always get an offer on a card and decline if you don't like the terms.
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:06:18
Founder of the site here. We're currently offering 80% on Target &amp; Walmart- if doesn't work out, shoot us an email!
I'm going to make the offers more clear on the site soon. I know people get apprehensive about sending card information before at least knowing the percent they'll get- should have it fixed in a bit.
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:34:41
Working on it!
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:30:58
We did indeed.
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:56:33
We're working on other chains and on local shops. Empowering indie shops was what got me interested in gift cards in the first place, so it's definitely top of mind.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:38:40
Thanks for the feedback! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-05-04 01:22:28
If we can show demand, we can make that call happen.
@_date: 2015-05-15 21:59:00
Don't be sad! We work our asses off to fight fraud, since it comes directly out of our bottom line.
@_date: 2015-05-15 23:09:08
There's an entire secondary market. Our discounts are larger than Gyft's because we take advantage of that, versus buying directly from merchants in bulk (which only yields 3-5% off).
@_date: 2017-02-12 21:45:56
I'm not making a statement of BU vs Core code quality. I'm saying comparing two GitHub contribution graphs doesn't qualify or disqualify someone as "cypherpunk"- and it's not very meaningful in general.
I guess you answered the comment you wanted me to leave?
@_date: 2014-08-10 03:24:23
Do you mean after we buy them on cardforcoin? The fraud/double-spend prevention mechanisms are a little complicated, but basically we load the new cards we deliver via balance transfers. We also have partnered gift card exchanges- we don't just rely on our own.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:24:33
A smoother anonymous mode is in the works! Thanks for your feedback :) 1 coffee @_date: 2015-05-04 01:36:54
Awesome! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-05-15 22:01:15
Founder here. We buy from people who have extra Starbucks cards, or got them in online surveys. In fact, we buy mostly from a handful of trusted sellers.
Details on how the card procurement side got started are here 
If we didn't have a handle on this, in our model, we wouldn't have a profitable business.
Hope that helps explain things.

Rent is probably in your local currency. Locking up 12 months of rent would expose you to significant exchange risk.
This is an interesting idea, but considering the current volatility it won't work for non BTC-denominated expenses.
@_date: 2015-05-15 23:12:14
Thanks. It is tough- I've got plenty of stories of successful fraudsters from when we first started cardforcoin.com. But since then, we've had to adapt, including limits on the age, brand, and amount of a card, as well as a reputation system.
Bulk sellers go through an additional ID verification process and have to submit details about where their cards come from. They're also held accountable for any charged-back cards, and if they don't pay we stop doing business with them.
@_date: 2017-02-15 20:47:09
I'd argue that even nodes in the same datacenter have some value if they're controlled by different economic actors. Not as valuable to the network as if they were in distinct locations, but disparate locations and incentives both improve network health.

Hey, Fold founder here.
I originally started cardforcoin.com because I had tons of gift cards I didn't want. We've learned a ton about the space since then.
There are over $114B in gift cards sold each year in the US alone. Over 10% go unused. So, yes- there are a ton of opportunities here if you know where to look. It's an entire middle-man ridden economy, in fact. Thus companies like Raise.com, which recently raised nearly $100M in VC.
Hope that helps :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:34:16
Founder here. No scam- we just buy gift cards cheaper than our competitors, eg via another site of ours, cardforcoin.com.
I think we've got a killer app! Any help getting the word out would be appreciated.
@_date: 2015-05-03 22:11:45
My other answer on the sibling comment is relevant, but- we estimate there are nearly $14B in unwanted gift cards each year in the US. Check out sites like Raise.com and GiftCardZen for some idea of the scope.
I know the stolen CC narrative sounds good, but consider this. Every time a stolen CC has a chargeback, the gift card we're holding is zeroed. If that happens with any frequency, we can't run a profitable business. I spend a lot of time on anti-fraud to make sure that's not the case.
I hope that clears things up a bit. Doing my best to be transparent while maintaining our competitive advantages.

@_date: 2017-02-05 21:24:19
Probably better solved by a new protocol- BIP 70 for recurring payments. Solving this at a lower level (eg via timelocks) means the exchange rate needs to be agreed up front.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:59:57


Sorry, I didn't mean to minimize by calling it a narrative. Agreed, it's a big deal. And to be clear, I've personally lost thousands of dollars due to carders. I mostly meant- we're aware of the problem because we've had to deal with it this past year, and we can't run the business profitably without dealing with it. I'm confident in the anti-fraud measures we've taken so far.
Raise et al now offers 7% off- but it wasn't long ago that they offered 18%. And around the holidays, the gift card discounts shoot up. I understand it feels too good to be true, but we're not so far outside the market as it seems, considering the fees they take from their sellers + the 3-day ACH all of their sellers have to wait on.


Thanks! I appreciate the discussion :)

Hey, founder here!
We've had some issues with Starbucks inventory lately due to demand, but the team is working on a fix. We should have something in the coming weeks to smooth this out.
As far as Target, though- we have tons of inventory. Your not seeing it sounds like a bug to me. Could I get a screenshot of the issue so we can look into it?
@_date: 2016-01-14 04:43:37
If there's a button that says "chargeback"? Yeah. It doesn't take a tech genius to commit credit card fraud, and if the wallet makes it easy, it won't take a sophisticated user to hit the "get my money back" button.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:25:17
Aw :( We'll get there though.
@_date: 2015-05-08 10:52:09
Founder here. Don't do that! It probably won't be a big deal, but if we ever have an issue with a card of ours I don't want it to impact your gold card. I understand the urge to double-dip,  just know it's risky.

Thanks for the page!
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:58:23
Presumably mainstream consumers won't need to know details like that... it's easy to imagine a brand of wallet that defaults to RBF, and users don't know the difference. And from a UX perspective, they shouldn't have to.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:35:59
Initial user attempts suggest not. That might not be the case across the whole country though (it might depend on whether a store is franchised, etc). We'd certainly appreciate a test- that's how we found out we work in HK and Macau :)
The options right now are $5, $10, and $25, but you can refund your change, so it's pretty close. The old version of our product had that capability, but it made inventory management very difficult. We might enable it again in the future.

To be clear, anyone can modify a node to do whatever they want with their local mempool- it's outside Bitcoin consensus. So while this is somewhat true in practice, it doesn't stand up to an adversary


As we were accepting small payments and it was difficult to defraud us for a lot of money, the issue was mostly around payments getting "stuck" in the mempool during fee events. The fee event in 2017 made it incredibly clear we couldn't continue to expect folks to use Bitcoin's L1 for coffee-size purchases
@_date: 2019-08-11 23:14:07
2015, before the split.
Fold did almost die. The fee event before Lightning was tough on us- we didn't want to pivot to other coins or custodial payments, but folks couldn't pay those fees for small purchases. Luckily we stuck it out.
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:44:43
You guys are confusing the mempool (where 0-conf transactions live) and a tx making it into a block (1 conf+). While a non-RBF tx might be difficult to replace in the mempool given honest miners, replacement is actually at the miner's discretion... so trusting 0-conf tx's means you're trusting miners.
Source: ran a large 0-conf retailer. We've replaced it with Lightning.

@_date: 2019-12-05 21:51:53


What do you want here? "Very doable for funded adversaries" aka Chainanalysis-type co's (once Lightning is popular enough to have a market for this) and state-level actors.
It's not hard to force someone to open a channel with you if you have resources- you coerce someone who already has an open channel. That's one subpoena or NSL to a major merchant with routing nodes. Maybe that doesn't seem "very doable" to you but for those of us on the network and running businesses in the space, it's a clear risk.
Maybe you think I'm talking about privacy from your neighbor, but I'm talking about the big shebang- tech for dissidents. And that means resilience to well-funded adversaries.
@_date: 2019-12-05 19:13:18
It's a "Sybil attack". And yes, without Sybil resistance and other improvements like AMP active surveillance on Lightning is straightforward for a well-funded attacker.
[Here's a recent paper]( where a $2000 routing attack was used to DoS 80% of Lighting payments on mainnet. If you don't see how that can be extended to surveillance, I'm happy to walk through it.
@_date: 2019-12-04 02:46:25
Pretty sure you just need the first and last routing node node + some inference around timing / size
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:34:21
Ah, I give you a solid example and you give me.. nothing. Fantastic.


This is more than enough to get amounts and source / sink nodes, what else do you want?

@_date: 2015-07-07 02:14:02
You got it! 1 coffee It's a little more nuanced than that, but that's the gist. This update makes things faster today, but it mostly enables new brands and the pending mobile app. We also needed it for 3rd party integrations (imagine someone sent you $5 at Starbucks via another service- it's much easier to give you a new barcode).
@_date: 2019-12-03 19:05:31
Sorry, I should've been clear. I don't mean malicious routing, I'm talking about surveillance.
ln.big can surveil most of the network, today. Similar to the recent "attack" on Grin's Dandelion routing.
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:17:59
They'll love it. Almost as easy to trace, less obvious to users.
@_date: 2019-12-04 02:40:53


Here's something contrived. Let's say I have 1/3 of the network, and that I've been building connectivity a while. If all routes on the network have at least one intermediary node, and routes are uniformly distributed, there's a 1/3 chance I see a particular payment. For any 3-hop payment I see I can surmise the source and sink nodes for each route.
If the average route length is higher, I can't assume the last and next hop are the source and sink... but for each extra hop in a route there's an increased likelihood I'm on a route. If two of my nodes see payments of the same size, they should be able to link the two and tell who was first on the route. If routes are uniform, there's something like a 1/9 chance I'd know the source and the sink nodes.
Anyway, classic Sybil attack stuff.
Source routing or no, users can't all be expected to do significant diligence on pieces of the payment network to get privacy guarantees.
@_date: 2019-12-04 02:54:53
Nope, just set a low fee rate or otherwise take advantage of the default routing algos and you'll get a disproportionate amount of routes.

@_date: 2019-12-06 19:43:48
Of course it's better than L1's privacy, and of course it shouldn't die :P
I've been honest- it's an improvement, but it doesn't "solve Bitcoin privacy" and it's not (yet!) resilient to well-funded adversaries surveiling the network. If we want to robustly solve Bitcoin fungibility we need bigger ideas and a higher bar
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:26:10
Sure. Two points here
1) Privacy today on L1 obviously doesn't exist- any user can see that with a block explorer, and most people who get into Bitcoin realize the transparency quickly. Lightning is much more difficult for your average user to inspect, considering the new terminology, the more complex network topology, private channels, etc.
2) However, that doesn't mean it's resistant to surveillance- it just means inspection requires more infrastructure. Surveillance companies have the resources to deploy probe nodes in Lightning and monitor private channels. Now we have a system with poor privacy, without the user awareness.
I'm excited about AMP, etc for incremental improvements here, but we need to remember Lightning is for payments. Privacy is a distant secondary concern in its design today.
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:08:52
You don't have to split your money- for the most part, you'll still have one barcode. But if you hit refund, for example, while one code is refunding, you can still load another one.
This way is quite a bit faster, but the real motivation is future brands. Many merchants we plan to support won't work without an interface like this.
How do you think we can improve the blog post? Would a video or something help? I don't want to scare anyone off with complexity.
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:21:09
Agreed, I hate managing cards as well. In fact, I even call them "barcodes" instead of cards- I think the entire "card" paradigm for pre-paid credit is old-fashioned, and we'll be trying to better bridge that gap in the mobile app.
Anyway, today, this shouldn't affect you much unless
* a refund hangs, and you want to reload. It'll fetch a new barcode while the original is refunded.
* you want to load more than $25
Hope that helps :)

This is just about fitting a narrative- it's more popular to poke at those two than Jeff Garzik, Mike Belshe, Brian Armstrong, Peter Smith, etc. Why? Because this post is about whipping up the mob and Jihan and Roger have fallen out of favor, and the rest lead to uncomfortable questions ("wait, how can some of BTC's biggest proponents be the enemy?").
The psychological dissonance and clear manipulation here are amazing.

Cool idea, that's definitely possible. Should have an update gifting / tipping soon.


Right now, we need to keep a specific inventory or cards- though we might be able to handle custom amounts down the road. What do you think of sending any amount in BTC, and us choosing the largest card possible, and keeping the rest as a balance? Just kicking the idea around.

Lol, the bold should be rewarded. 2 coffees @_date: 2015-04-16 02:06:40
Yeah, the use case is for people who want to get rid of old gift cards. If you buy eg a Target or Walmart card, we pay $7.50 for a $10.
@_date: 2015-04-17 20:49:29
Thanks for the feedback! 1 coffee &gt; No I never had heard of you
Agreed. Right now we're focusing on letting bitcoin users know about us, then trying to enlist their help to push for mainstream adoption.


It also works in the UK, Canada, Australia, HK, Mexico- we just haven't found a way to address continental Europe yet. We'll do our best with our other merchants though- if there are others in Europe that have the proper hardward / a reasonable market share, let us know and we'll do what we can!
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:23:34
Makes sense. I think I'd find it confusing if we hadn't built it, ha. Thanks again :)
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:59:26
If you can send us a pic of the bar codes used in Mexico, we might be able to make a version that works there as well- happy to pay for a card just to see, if you're interested.
@_date: 2015-04-16 02:07:47
Heh, check out cardforcoin.com. We offer 75% for Target &amp; Walmart cards.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:50:23
Oh, I see. Good point. We might look at e-commerce down the road, but it's a heavily contested space. For now, the plan is to focus on in-store and revisit.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:05:31
Agreed. Our limitations are mostly about how Starbucks gift cards work, and that we don't have the cash / network yet to test in all these countries. We've confirmed Canada, UK, HK, and a few other spots.
I also doubt we'll be able to work in countries that are primarily franchised / have less corporate control, since payments are tough to unify in disparate stores.
 Let us know if you try it elsewhere, and here's a coffee to get you started! @_date: 2015-04-17 02:41:06
Aw, can I really not tip you? Great advice regardless, thank you!
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:54:58
Yeah, we require an explicit refund address so no one accidentally sends funds back to eg a random Circle or Coinbase address.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:38:23
I literally haven't downvoted a single post -_-
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:21:55
The question he's asking is still valid regardless of key control
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:45:07
Thanks for the feedback! 1 coffee We're going to launch more denominations soon. We changed refunds a bit to [use bitcoin addresses instead of emails]( we'll keep polishing that so it's really easy to refund to eg an email,  or maybe a OneName or ChangeTip account.


How are you thinking that'd work?
@_date: 2015-04-15 23:34:00
We buy gift cards on cardforcoin.com -&gt; check it out. We offer 60% on Starbucks cards (and usually only buy from bulk sellers), but if you email us mention this Reddit post and I can offer 70% :)
@_date: 2015-04-17 09:14:26
That's awesome, wow! Thanks for testing it! another coffee @_date: 2015-04-17 21:07:01
Thanks for the feedback! 1 coffee &gt; Personally I would like to know in which countries it's working
We've confirmed UK, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, and the US. We're pretty sure Mexico works as well. A few spots in continental Europe (Switzerland, Germany, Spain) haven't worked, but I'm hopeful we find some that do.


That is wonderful advice. We'll do what we can!
@_date: 2015-04-16 02:03:49
It'll be a while. Instead of waiting on us, maybe check out 
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:36:08


Believe it or not, we didn't post those.


This is a much faster, more scalable way to support bitcoin as a currency. I appreciate what you're saying (I'd rather support a merchant that supports bitcoin themselves)- but we need to take action to make that happen.
What we're doing- discount included- gives random consumers a **reason** to care about and use bitcoin, despite that it's still pretty difficult to do that. And I think that's necessary to drive wide adoption.


Are there other merchants we could support that you'd care more about?
I appreciate the (brutal, honest) feedback- 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 21:57:44
Unknown, but there's a good chance it does. We definitely work in Canada, the UK, HK, and a few other spots. If you test it, let us know-  that would be awesome. 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 20:51:15
Great idea. We tried something similar but the execution wasn't good enough (people were confused)- who do you think does the best job at physical bitcoin giveaways now?
Thanks for the feedback, and enjoy a coffee on us! @_date: 2015-04-23 18:29:51
Doubtful- we haven't seen it work yet in continental Europe, and I think Spanish stores are mostly franchises. We'd welcome a test though, and anything you can tell us about how the gift cards work there would speed up our support.
In case you're interested, coffee is on me. @_date: 2015-04-17 20:38:56
Thanks for the feedback! Next coffee is on us We buy gift cards in bulk at a lower prices via another product of ours, cardforcoin.com. We then pass those discounts, minus our margin, to Fold customers.
@_date: 2015-04-17 09:19:21
Thanks for your feedback! 1 coffee &gt; NoScript
Good call, it's been a while since I've done that. I'll add it to the issue tracker.


They're used to gift cards. In the US it's either with a scanner next to the register or by the barista keying in the number.
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:48:18
Here's a coffee to get you started @_date: 2015-04-17 07:35:04
Thanks for the feedback! Next coffee is on us &gt; Nothing helps people find you better than providing valuable content.
Great point. We're just starting to build our blog now- a ton of our upcoming posts will be from the feedback in this thread.


Working on addressing this in a blog post, but basically we buy gift cards via another product of ours- cardforcoin.com- at a discount. We've spent a bunch of time on our anti-fraud system for that part of the business to be profitable, so we're confident in the cards we use. We also buy primarily from bulk sellers, which helps us keep the fraud down.
Hope that answers some questions, and thanks again for the feedback!
@_date: 2015-04-17 05:55:55
Very aware, yeah. We've been buying gift cards for the past year, and have had to build an anti-fraud system around our operation to stay profitable. At the end of the day, though, the best way to fight fraud has been to focus on bulk sellers we've built relationships with.
Thanks for the question- check out the app some time. 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-17 02:39:05
Thanks again for the feedback! Actually it was part of the inspiration for this post- we do need to be much more present than we have been in the past.
Next coffee is on us ;) @_date: 2015-04-16 21:41:58
We're still young ha. And learning the whole "marketing" thing. Here's a coffee on us- let us know how it goes! @_date: 2015-04-15 23:31:57
Yeah, but only in California I think. The baristas will give you mean looks ;)
@_date: 2015-04-10 20:46:26
Thanks for the feedback! I'll look into building a team page, it's long overdue.
I've tried to make sure people know who I am, but you're right- our exposure on Reddit isn't close to enough.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:39:40
That's the plan! We're working on Target and Whole Foods next.


You can use coffee.foldapp.com right now (on your phone, tablet, desktop...) via your browser- we just want to provide a better experience on mobile.
Thanks for the feedback! Have a coffee @_date: 2015-04-18 05:48:37
Excellent, the first coffee is on us &gt; If I refer my friends, will you award any benefits to me?
We don't have a referral program yet, but we've gotten the request a few times- I'll see what we can do.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:46:20
Ha awesome, have a coffee on us! @_date: 2015-04-20 06:34:38
Fallacy there, plenty of well-funded companies turn out to have poor strategy or execution. Though I'm excited to see what they're up to as well.
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:43:31
Altcoins haven't done much for us in the past, but we'll keep kicking it around. Thanks for your feedback! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-23 18:33:20
Not yet AFAIK, but a test or some info on how the gift cards work in DE would be helpful. Eg do they have scanners? what do the barcodes look like?
Any help would be appreciated! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 21:40:45


On it! Thanks for the feedback, and let us know how it goes. 1 coffee @_date: 2017-10-08 13:35:05
Since when have Roger and Jihan been the big proponent behind SegWit2x? Oh, that's right. They haven't been, and this is ridiculous manipulative demagoguery as they're the favored bogeymen from the last fiasco.
Grow up.
@_date: 2015-04-18 04:03:49
Thanks! 1 coffee &gt; I know its cheesy but this is a chance at word of mouth promotion.
Nah, it's not cheesy. Well, maybe "I LOVE BITCOIN" ha, but the idea is a good one. I could see giving people extra BTC for posting a selfie with their coffee to Twitter or Facebook or something.
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:15:21
Target and Whole Foods are next up, but Walmart is on the roadmap.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:51:33
Agreed. I was thinking Facebook would be next, and maybe fixing the "anonymous" mode to just require an email. WDYT?
Thanks for the feedback btw, your next coffee is on us :) @_date: 2015-04-17 03:03:49
Oh, and have a coffee! :)
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:56:13
Jamba Juice? That's a new request- I'll look into it.
Thanks for checking us out! We'll do our best. Let me know if there's anything we can do to make the experience better down the road. 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-17 03:05:43
That's true, but it should be easier in eg the Play store and does decently as "fold bitcoin" or "fold app".
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:19:20
We aren't hiring yet, but we might be in a couple months- if you want, shoot a CV (or whatever you think is cooler / more appropriate) to jobs 'at' foldapp.com
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:52:07


Most people we talked to were anxious / concerned about the auto-refund, and wanted to hold onto their balance (at least for a while). It  might make sense as an option though- once we have accounts straightened out we could look into that.


Me too. We just [switched away from Coinbase]( for refunds / payment processing.
Thanks for your feedback! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-18 05:47:44


I think the closest is Gyft? We've got a better discount and I think our UX paradigm is more appropriate, but they've got way more merchants.


We don't (yet), but you can visit [coffee.foldapp.com]( on your phone's browser today. If you [sign up for the mailing list]( we'll let you know when the native apps launch.
First coffee is on us! @_date: 2015-04-16 20:55:28
We're working on it now! Two of our team members are racing to see which launches first- iOS or Android. Until then, give the web app a try! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 20:40:34
And thanks for the feedback! Here's a coffee :) @_date: 2015-04-17 02:40:14
Thanks! Have a coffee @_date: 2015-04-17 01:10:34
That would be awesome! First coffee is on us @_date: 2015-04-17 07:49:28
Oh, and the first coffee is on us! @_date: 2015-04-16 20:52:22
Thanks, let us know if you give the app a try! Here's a coffee to get you started @_date: 2015-04-16 21:46:29
Aw, shucks! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 20:43:48
Thanks for the feedback! Give it a try - they have cookies too! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-17 02:38:00
Oh, I see. The plan lately has been to get wallet apps to provide refund addresses, and maybe use stuff like OneName and Netki as well to make it easier. You're right that this would be a useful option though.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:37:31
Thanks for the feedback! 1 coffee I think the mobile app is going to make a huge difference.
As far as wallets- who do you use? We've talked with Airbitz and Pheeva so far and might get something going down the road.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:53:38
Aw, thanks again for the feedback! Have another coffee @_date: 2015-04-18 05:43:53
Thanks for the feedback :) Have a coffee &gt; I would suggest increasing the size of the bar code or darkening the bar code.
We've tested on quite a few scanners- the biggest thing we can do is to increase your screen brightness. Not possible from a web app, unfortunately, but we'll definitely do that on the mobile app.


I know, right? This has been way more successful that I imagined.
@_date: 2015-04-17 01:18:48
Yep, we're working in San Mateo right now, though the team is from Atlanta.
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:51:35
Thanks for the feedback! We're definitely trying to increase our marketing and will probably do a few more of these. Enjoy your coffee! @_date: 2015-04-16 22:21:37


We've mostly been focused on Twitter, but you're absolutely right. We're also only **just** starting to blog, if that gives you an idea of how little marketing we've done so far.


You got it. We're working on Target and Whole Foods now.


Haha, we love the Lawnmower guys! Just told them about this.
You're defnitely right about the landing page. Have you checked out the app page yet? [coffee.foldapp.com](


Great advice, thank you.
Really appreciate the in-depth response- here's 3 coffees on us @_date: 2015-04-17 03:11:36
Yeah, the real disadvantage to not logging in is if you clear your browser cookies or otherwise lose your session. We can restore it for people, but it's a huge pain.
Not sure why we haven't thought of putting the login prompt behind the load bitcoin button- great idea. Here's another coffee :) @_date: 2015-04-15 23:29:22
Ha, you just found an old recurring bug. Congrats! Here's a coffee We'll have it fixed (again) soon. If you do want to use Starbucks cards (ot another gift card) to buy bitcoin, though, you can check out our other product- cardforcoin.com.
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:48:46
Good question- have a coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 21:23:47
We've got an announcement ab gifting coming out soon- pretty excited to share it next month :)
@_date: 2015-04-17 21:46:54
Oh, and here's a coffee on us! @_date: 2015-04-16 21:21:12
Interesting idea- I'd love to work with those guys. Here's a coffee for your thoughts @_date: 2015-04-17 20:50:37
Should be fixed- I topped up and retried the tip.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:46:08
Thanks! Have a coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 20:53:35


Great idea- we've got plenty of reviews on Reddit, etc, but we don't link to them or show them off.
Thanks for your feedback, and let us know if you give the app a try! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-17 20:42:09
This is awesome! 4 coffees We'll share this on Twitter, etc. I'd love to treat your group for the trouble- let me know and I'll send you guys some more :)
@_date: 2015-04-18 05:51:20
Thanks for the feedback! 1 coffee &gt; What you need is some good online marketing


We should have an update on this in the next month or so!
@_date: 2015-04-17 07:41:42
Oh, I see. You've got it- you get the refund at the same 20% off, versus either spending the discount first or last.
@_date: 2015-04-17 07:46:09
Thanks for the detailed feedback! 1 coffee &gt; I don't have to setup a user account IIUC.
We thought that would be a good fit for the bitcoin community :)


Good idea. Not sure whether this will make it into the web app or be held off until the mobile app, though, since it's a little more difficult on the web.


Common request- I want to make sure people see our team as well. We're based in Atlanta and San Mateo, FWIW.


Thanks, I'll pass that on to our designer.
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:06:29
Awesome, let us know how it goes! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 22:07:32
Interesting, is the 20% discount still not enough to cover Canadians? Or is it that we used to only have 5 dollar options? Because we've got 10 now, and are working on larger options as well.
Thanks for the feedback, and I'd love to know more about the Canadian experience. 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-17 02:14:35
Thanks for the feedback! We're definitely exploring Tim Hortons and other coffee chains :) Until then, 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-18 05:55:53
Happy to buy from redditors. There are tabs for Walmart, Target, etc- just follow those directions with Starbucks, and reference this thread.
HTH :)
@_date: 2015-04-17 20:37:27
You know it! One more milestone (trying to coincide with demo day in May) and then we'll be ready to go. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 22:53:34
Baby steps.
@_date: 2015-04-17 20:51:09
Excellent, let us know how it goes! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-18 05:45:07
Thanks! This is one post of many, we'll definitely try to be more visible. 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-17 03:21:10

That depends on the governance of the company. Doubtful that BnkToTheFuture or similar sites targeting lay investors would get any sort of vote in their terms.
@_date: 2015-04-23 03:57:58
Founder here. As someone who buys a ton of gift cards and deals with the fraud- CryptoThrift is awful. The cards are bought with stolen credit cards, resold for bitcoin, and then whoever has the card when the chargeback hits loses their money. Not a good idea.
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:47:27
Thanks for the ideas. Any blogs you're thinking about?
1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 22:09:25
And thanks for checking it out! Your next coffee is on us @_date: 2019-09-27 13:03:04


Actually, pegged coins should also be fine for trading- but none of the pegs we're discussing are to a trading platform. Binance's "BTCB" is terrible tech, but maybe we'll see it get some trading volume due to the platform?


I know what you meant- but we have two counter-examples in the market right now. Bitcoin on Lightning is a different security model, Liquid is a different model, and there's no imbalance.
A friend of mine recently explained it well- there's Bitcoin, the asset, and Bitcoin, the network. Moving your bitcoin to a sidechain puts your bitcoin at the risk of a different (lower) security model, but the market doesn't appear to price that yet. Maybe it will as volume increases.
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:36:34
Well in case you want to try it before that... 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 20:36:02
Thanks for the feedback :) Have a coffee Initially I was against this, but we've gotten the request so many times that I'm reconsidering. I don't think we could share cards between us and the SB mobile app, but a button to export the card to the SB app might be doable.
@_date: 2015-04-18 04:06:01
Thanks for checking it out- next coffee is on us! &gt;  It didn't auto launch my wallet app (Blockchain.info's android app)
Weird- did you tap the QR code? It's a link to a bitcoin URI, so it works with most wallets (though not always Coinbase on iOS :/). I'll check it out with Blockchain.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:15:19
Thanks for the feedback! 1 coffee &gt; Say I load up $10 and make a purchase of $5, do the remaining $5 stay in my account or are they returned instantly? If so, do I need twitter to sign up?
If you want $10 at Starbucks, you send us $8 in BTC. If you only spend $5, $5 will remain- you can either leave it for later or hit "refund" to get it back in bitcoin.


Yep, by default you have an anonymous account, or you can log in with Twitter. If you don't want to log in / have a Twitter we can use the email to send you a login link.
This is a pretty confusing part of the current app -_- I think we need to "require" logins by default, or maybe make the anonymous version opt-in. WDYT?
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:12:04
We are working on Target and Whole Foods now, yeah. As far as bulk buying, we haven't done that **yet** but might be interested in the future. We're focusing on the consumer app first.
That said, if you want to talk in more detail PM me- I'm curious about the use case.
Also, have a coffee! @_date: 2015-04-17 09:22:40
Thanks for the feedback- have a coffee on us! @_date: 2015-04-18 05:52:26
Just saw this after tipping, sorry heh. I've been running around all day and left this tab open -_-
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:03:35
Right now, we're only offering up to $10 at a time, but we're working on larger denominations.
A lottery or random giveaway for users is a great idea!
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:09:03
We only ask you to load $4 in bitcoin to spend $5 at Starbucks- that's the 20% discount. What could we do to make that more clear on the payment form, you think?
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:15:16
Thanks! If you get a chance, check it out and let us know how it goes. 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-17 07:36:40


Actually, that's exactly what we offer- it just requires that you log in with Twitter to hold a balance for an extended period of time or across devices. We're looking to make that easier and add additional social login options, though.
Thanks for the feedback! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 21:02:04
You think so? We worked with doge in another product of ours, but it didn't move the needle as much as I'd thought it would.
Thanks for the feedback! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 22:47:36
Thanks for the feedback (and being an awesome customer)! 1 coffee We should have a larger denomination up soon- we've nearly fixed the underlying issue.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:45:37
Right now, all bitcoin is secured with multi-sig, and we've worked hard to defend the app. But it's not a really question of whether we'll get hacked- it's when. That's part of why we push people to refund their bitcoin after a purchase. We want to minimize reasons to attack us in the first place.
From what I've seen elsewhere in the space, we take security pretty seriously.
@_date: 2015-04-17 21:45:34
Starbucks has scanners facing the customer where you can scan a barcode to pay- so most of the time, you just walk in, order, and scan your phone on the scanner facing you. If they don't have one, you can ask the barista how to redeem a your voucher.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:40:02
Great idea about the video. Do you think low production value will hurt us, or should we just go for it with our phones until we can afford something better?
Re: the color - We're planning to move to other merchants (Target, Whole Foods) so we needed a brand that works outside coffee. But I see what you mean about using images.
@_date: 2015-04-17 07:49:14
As people have noted, we need an explanatory video. But basically, you
- go to coffee.foldapp.com
- tap "Load Bitcoin"
- choose a dollar amount (right now, 5 or 10)
- an address will be displayed. pay the amount requested from your wallet to that address
- wait a little bit
- we'll generate a barcode for you with a dollar amount attached
- when you pay at Starbucks, scan that barcode. The balance will be deducted.
Hope that makes sense!
@_date: 2015-09-11 20:37:04
Founder of Fold here. Quick clarification- Chain isn't a BoostVC company- Adam (the CEO) is a mentor though.
A [few of us use Chain's tech]( they've been really helpful and the focus on uptime is refreshing, especially considering the [immaturity of many infrastructure providers in the space]( I believe Chain has also announced proofs-of-concept with Nasdaq and Gyft.
BlockCypher provides some of the same services, and is a BoostVC company. I've heard great things about their service and love the team- we're planning to use them as a backup layer for blockchain / wallet notifications.
Pretty excited to see both of these companies grow. It's hard to stress how amateur many of the infrastructure services before them were, and better plumbing helps all bitcoin / blockchain companies.

See sibling comment re: voting. ShapeShift isn't a public company and we don't know its governance details, but it likely makes no difference, as they've likely been able to raise on founder-friendly terms.

You're right, we do have some ideas. We're working on updating the app and writing a blog post now. Thank for the feedback! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-23 18:25:58
Hey Mike, founder here. Definitely not a carding front- we just buy from people who don't want their Starbucks cards. The secondary gift card market is a little crazy, and we've spent a long time finding trustworthy sources. Planning a blog post to explain the discount, but it's a fine line since it's part of our competitive advantage.
Payment protocol support is on the way, as well as some other refund address options.
Thanks for the feedback- we're big fans!
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:33:01
Yep, it's just mobile web right now- we're working on native apps.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:25:47
Thanks, your next coffee is on us! Absolutely agree about the importance of customer service, especially in our space where it's so rare. I hope we can help drive consumer adoption!
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:39:36
Interesting ideas!- 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-17 02:58:21
Will do. We might need some blogging / lead generation help in a few months..

Thanks for the feedback! 1 coffee &gt; I am in the UK and in about a month I am on holiday in the USA
Have a good trip! In case it's not clear, we should work in both countries.


[Here's a video]( from a slightly older version that the CryptoCurrency Club at UD did. It doesn't include the actual scanning, but hopefully helps.
The QR code on your phone is also a link to a bitcoin URI. If you tap it, it should open any wallet on your phone that's registered to handle that.
Let me know if that helps :)

Here's a coffee for your thoughts! @_date: 2015-04-17 02:11:07

Great point. I'll start working on a blog post.

Go to Starbucks, visit  load up $4 in bitcoin for a $5 purchase, pay by scanning your phone, then hit "refund" to get your change in bitcoin.
Here's $1 to get you started :)
@_date: 2015-04-13 16:24:02
Good to know! One of our issues is that we don't have a Tim Hortons nearby to test with (we're in Atlanta &amp; San Mateo)... if we had some help testing we might be able to swing it.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:00:57


This is becoming a theme- you're absolutely right.


Users have confirmed we work in Canada, the UK, Hong Kong, and a few other places. We **should** work in Mexico but a user that tested it had an issue- I'd say try it. If they can't scan it the barista can enter the card number in at the register, and if you have a problem you can always refund the card.
Regardless, thanks for the feedback! Here's a coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 21:18:04
Oh, and have a coffee! @_date: 2015-04-17 09:12:52
We're planning to have it working at a couple other major retailers this summer. Thanks for the feedback! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 21:30:42
It's the latest Coinbase spot price, updated every 5 minutes I think? We don't take any fees / intentional spread on the bitcoin, though if you load $8 and leave it there for more than a couple minutes, the amount you get as a refund will fluctuate with the price.
Maybe we should have a page or a blog post about that?
Thanks for the question! Your first coffee is on us @_date: 2015-04-17 07:38:03
We are available in Canada, and since it's a web app, it works fine on any device- just go to coffee.foldapp.com on your mobile browser.
Thanks! 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-16 02:08:06
Lol. 1 coffee @_date: 2015-04-17 07:46:37
Awesome, the first coffee is on us :) @_date: 2015-04-16 20:47:11
I'm so glad to hear you've noticed the reliability improvements- we've worked really hard on that, and I think it's led to more repeat usage.


We [moved off Coinbase to Chain]( for payment processing recently- has it been a problem since then?
Definitely having trouble getting the word out, let us know if you have any ideas :) Thanks for the feedback (and being an awesome customer!) 1 coffee @_date: 2015-03-09 16:04:44
Looks like somebody just added it! $5 When you say promote, do you just mean externally (eg sharing our CoinJabber profile) or do they have advertising?
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:16:49
You could pay $16 in BTC for $20 at Starbucks, only spend $3, and get a $13 refund in BTC- does that make sense?
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:43:31
You've got the idea, though the math is a tiny bit off- to get $10 on Fold you load $8 in BTC, since the discount is up-front. That's ~$13.20 in CAD. So ultimately, you should get 13.20 CAD in coffee for $8 USD.
I haven't personally used the app in Canada, but our Canadian users have been happy about the discount so far. Maybe we should add a currency preference or something to make it more obvious?
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:52:16
Good point. We have an option to log in with Twitter to preserve your card, but we haven't made it a big part of the UI yet. The mobile app will be easier in that regard, since we can just assume a phone is an "account".
Maybe we should go account-first on the web and ask for a login, and only work the way we currently do when a user chooses "stay anonymous" or something like that?
@_date: 2015-03-16 12:04:04
That's the rub- browsers expire sessions. I'm thinking we'll generate some sort of return URL for users who don't want to sign in, and display that. What do you think?
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:47:29
 is the homepage- we're working on an app!
@_date: 2015-03-28 11:03:15
A few people got an early look ;) - very excited.
@_date: 2016-05-12 14:54:58
That... really doesn't work.Those other gift card sites you sell will require that you guarantee the card 60 - 180 days- and if there's an issue with the card, they'll debit your account. Double spends still happen, and you'll be left holding the bag.
@_date: 2015-03-11 00:37:55
We buy them at a discount via our other product, 
@_date: 2015-03-11 00:36:18
You can't, but we're working on our own rewards program in addition to the 20% discount. Note that the current discount is still quite a bit more than Starbucks offers, unless you work hard to optimize it (eg always get a really expensive drink for the free one).
@_date: 2016-05-12 14:51:41
Have you tried 
@_date: 2016-05-13 16:08:39
This is very Google-able..? 
Add a goal in the interface, send an event that matches the attributes on the goal. If you want to make sure it's triggering, watch the  "real time events" section- the other pages won't update immediately with the new data.
@_date: 2015-03-26 07:30:52
Thanks :)
@_date: 2016-05-27 13:27:58
Are you using Fold? If so, imagine we were only offering a 3% discount. At 7.5 cents / transaction, the discount no longer makes it worthwhile for $5 vouchers.
We have a built-in incentive to use bitcoin, which helps, but that doesn't mean a trend of increasing transaction fees won't become a problem :/
Thanks for being a user!
@_date: 2015-11-17 05:13:51
Sure! Sorry I took so long to respond. Here goes.
I'll assume you have bitcoin in a mobile wallet for brevity's sake.
At Starbucks, or before you arrive, visit  on your phone. Log in with Twitter or Facebook, or "anonymously".
Aside: Anonymous logins keep us from seeing any personal info (other than what every other site sees, and your bitcoin address when you pay). But it relies on browser cookies, so if you clear yours a bunch it can be extra work.
Choose an amount you want to spend. Say, $5. You'll see a QR code and payment details requesting $4 in bitcoin. This is where you get the 20% discount.
Tap the code or one of the other links, and you'll be taken to your mobile wallet, with the amount prefilled. Pay, and go back to youre browser- and you'll see a Starbucks voucher.
Pay at the register (there are front-facing scanners for the barcode) and enjoy your coffee. If you want your change back in bitcoin, hit "refund".
Let us know how it goes :)
@_date: 2016-05-01 23:03:15
We're having issues with our inventory processing tech. Normally we'd compensate from liquidity on other exchanges, but the rest of the market is getting squeezed. The two issues together are what made this a disruption.
@_date: 2015-10-07 00:46:31
You can't expect people to send bitcoin home when their family doesn't have internet access. The last mile problem isn't just about your choice of denomination, but also easy access to technology.
@_date: 2015-10-18 00:26:46
Apparently our notification service today isn't. I've reached out to them about the issue, and am looking into a short-term workaround.
It doesn't appear to be affecting everyone, and if you've already got a balance you can spend normally- this is just a problem for new deposits.
Thanks for your patience everyone! We've fixed the initial issue with payment notifications. Our provider was unavailable (:/), but we worked through the night to build a backup notification system on the BlockCypher API.
We're still working to get refunding straightened out- until it is, we've disabled the feature. Otherwise, we're open for business! If you have a pending refund from yesterday, we'll take care of you via support
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:02:57
Still coming along. Everything takes 3x longer than estimated and all that.
We're currently iterating on an internal iOS alpha, and we've also got an Android app that's nearly caught up to it. A limited beta should happen in the next 2 months. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:52:02
Sorry! Ran low on inventory due to the Reddit traffic. Fixed :)
@_date: 2015-11-30 22:23:24
Argh, I'll message the admins I guess.
@_date: 2015-10-31 08:39:18
I see you all over r/bitcoin lately!
@_date: 2016-05-12 16:50:55
Oh? I'll look into it and see what's going on.
EDIT: For some reason our internal system had a hold on the order- fixed it! You should be good to go.
@_date: 2015-11-20 20:43:19
The Reddit model doesn't incentivize original content at all- it just relies on the fact that content creators are paid by advertising on their own sites, which is a huge conflict IMO. Paid content typically gets more editorial freedom than advertising-supported content.
Besides, people are already doing something like this on Reddit with tipbots. So far, tipping hasn't destroyed Reddit. I think ZapChain is just a natural extension of some of those ideas.
Anyway, it's early days, but I like where it's going so far.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:09:52
Thanks for the feedback- here's $4 in case you want to give it a try risk-free We were trying to keep the experience app-like- how can we better explain, you think?

Thanks for the feedback! $5 in case you want to try the app :)
The video idea has come up a few times. I guess anything we can do to put a face on the company helps, but we don't have much of a production budget- do you think a shoe-string YouTube video will cut it?
As far as our business model, we buy gift cards on the secondary market (eg with our other product,  Since we get the cards so cheap, we can afford a significant discount and still make money.
@_date: 2015-10-09 03:56:09


Actually, that's exactly right, and the reason I started the business- I had $300 in Starbucks gift cards from a couple holidays. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:17:10
I don't think we're all the same- I've struggled to do business with firms in China myself due to cultural difference. I just try to avoid sweeping generalizations about entire continents ;)

@_date: 2015-10-07 17:21:07
Founder here. At scale, we'll also tap wholesale gift cards and give a smaller discount,  but we have $10B a year in unspent cards to tackle first (in the US alone).
This is a little handwavy, but if 1% of Starbucks customers is 63k tx a day (from discussion on Twitter last night) and each customer spends $5, that's $115M a year in gift cards. Starbucks does ~$4B / year in gift cards last time I checked, so their breakage should be a cool $400M. I suspect it's higher for Starbucks and generally varies by brand. So 1% would be difficult, but not impossible.
Getting that much of the secondary market every year would squeeze our margins / the discount. How much is a question of marketing costs and how competitive the landscape is, but most in this space aren't yet advertising. Wholesale cards means there's a 4% floor on the discount, so we'd land somewhere between here and there, based on our efficiency sourcing cards. I've got some ideas that could guarantee up to 15% for the next few years, but I'll keep those up my sleeve for now.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:17:05
Thanks for the feedback! $4 Do you think we should try to explain the discount, or just focus on appearing more legit? I'm leaning toward the latter, since I don't want people to need to understand how we offer the discount. And if that's the case- what would help the most? Endorsements? PR? Some sort of redesign or better text on the site?
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:07:54
Fair enough. $4 in case you want to give the new site a try :)
That downtime while we switched over to coffee.foldapp was pretty rough. We've emailed past coinforcoffee users, but maybe I should give it another shot?
Target is still planned- first with the iOS and Android apps, then the  web app. We're also grinding on Whole Foods, though that might be replaced with another brand come launch.
@_date: 2015-03-11 03:14:35
I hope so- let us know how it goes. We've got plans to add another user flow for new bitcoiners as well- eg, explaining how to buy bitcoin, suggesting a starter wallet, etc.
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:57:30
Sorry you haven't gotten a response yet! I'm struggling to keep up with support for the holiday rush. If you share some more info (either here or PM) I'll check on your ticket.

@_date: 2016-05-01 02:32:53
There are a couple assumptions here, so I'm going to try to unpack them (and answer your question as well). I'm working on a blog post about this now, so it'll be good practice. Forgive me if I ramble a bit.
TLDR; We aren't just trying to scale one brand, at one price point.
What are we trying to scale? We're trying to give bitcoiners the best deal possible at the register, across major retailers, using the secondary gift card market. We're effectively a gift card broker dealer who saves on both sides of the transaction by using bitcoin (plus proprietary tech that makes the gift card side more efficient).
We aren't trying to scale a 20% discount at Starbucks for using bitcoin, infinitely, to everyone. That's not sustainable. Starbucks issues $4B yearly in gift cards. If it follows a similar trend to the rest of the gift card market, 10% of those cards go unspent each year- probably more, because Starbucks does a great job marketing its program to rewards co's, etc. That means $400M a year that could possibly be bought in unspent Starbucks cards. We're building our business on other retailers as well, though, and across the US market, there's $120B in gift cards sold per year.
*What's happening right now*
We haven't hit the limits of the market yet at this price point. We have, however, had trouble matching supply with demand on the tech side. It takes more work for us to process and transfer cards ourselves, and we don't have the throughput we need (yet).
We're planning to alleviate that by letting the discount slip when our inventory is low, and taking liquidity from other exchanges- and if those are out, we'll pull wholesale cards (similar to Gyft or eGifter). If we do that naively, we'll pay the same as a consumer would- but because we're a bulk buyer, we command better rates with both exchanges and issuers.
So, back to your question about exchanges offering 20% off at Starbucks. There's been a squeeze on the market the past couple months, including bulk buyers (possibly Starbucks themselves?) taking liquidity. Still, CardCash typically offers 11-12% off when they have inventory. They're charging an additional ~6% for payment processing (on both sides of the tx), + whatever their take is. That's 18% right there in our model.
If you want to keep track of this stuff, there are liquidity tracking sites (eg  that help give you an idea. Once you've spent some time in the space, though, you realize that the public "order books" are a small part of the total liquidity, that the visible market is easy to manipulate (as we've seen these past couple months), and that issuers are actively interfering and occasionally even quietly partnering with the exchanges.
Anyway, I know this went on kind of long. Just realize our goal is to give bitcoiners the best the market can offer across retailers, maximizing their purchasing power-  not just a discount on their morning coffee.
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:47:13
Refunds in bitcoin-land are tough- we can't just naively refund to the address you used to send (because eg Coinbase and other hosted wallets) and BIP-70 isn't implemented in all wallets. You can actually put a bitcoin address in if you'd prefer, the email field is something we're planning to replace.
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:15:25


Same re: China. And I get it- it is very different. I'm commenting on the next part


But I've also done business with companies in Asia that directly contradict this sweeping statement. Considering the anti-Chinese hysteria around here due to the large mining presence, I think it's reasonable to not make shitty statements, and help improve the dialog.
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:51:36
Dang, apparently the Reddit traffic caught up with our inventory- sorry about that! Should be good now.

Couldn't you upload papers proving ownership? Imagine you're in a less stable country- you could certify all your deeds in case of a regime change.
@_date: 2015-03-11 00:37:02
We don't- we need to change balances on cards, so we can't have people registering them randomly.
@_date: 2015-10-08 04:44:59
I disagree with, well, all of this... but that's okay. For right now, what's important is that we're offering this discount to bitcoiners, and we plan to do it for as long as we can. I hope we continue to enjoy the community's support for that.
EDIT: I just realized you missed


... so, that too :)
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:29:15

Thanks for the feedback! $5 Definitely working on adding the $10, $20, and $50 options back. In fact... if we removed the $5 option and only had the rest, what would you think?
@_date: 2015-10-07 17:00:08
Hey, founder here. Conservatively, gift cards in the U.S. are a $120B market. Every year, ~10% of gift cards go unspent. $12+B a year of gift cards accumulating in purses and drawers is a huge opportunity.
Fraudsters are certainly a problem, but they aren't the majority you're suggesting. We do spend a ton of effort combatting fraud- bad cards get deactivated and come out of our bottom line, so the business doesn't work with too high a fraud rate.
The bigger picture is that we won't just scale secondary gift cards, though- eventually we'll use wholesale as well, and go after and grow the larger gift card opportunity.
@_date: 2015-10-03 21:05:27
Hey, founder here. Not sure why you say "nothing more". We're trying to build a new in-store mobile payment experience using gift cards as rails. Compare our product to gift card companies' and I think the difference is striking- for us gift cards are a means of payment, not of source of revenue from breakage.
