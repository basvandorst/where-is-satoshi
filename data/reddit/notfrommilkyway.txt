Except nobody just bought back then and still sits on it. They bought again on every dip, be it from 20k or 10k, and they lost more than what they made with their initial investment. Because that's the thing with greed, you get greedy. You throw everything you have at the chance, because hey, you tripled your original investment, now let's do it again. The number of people that actually got rich with crypto is a short list. And they all sold in November/December a year ago when it was obvious the bubble was about to burst (when your bus driver talks about new crypto investments, it is time to bail).

I don't. And I personally know somebody that took a $20k loan to rebuy BTC at 14K after investing first at 18K. They all got what they deserved.

Yeah, tulips had a great run over the last two hundred years. Their price, not so much. There is no value in Bitcoin because it can't be used the way it was intended. It's too volatile for a currency.

2200 is going to be here very soon. From there we'll get a nice rebound and then it falls to sub 1K.

Sometime in 2021 you will realize that there was no shorting going on, just whales being desperate to get out while they still can and selling their shit to the morons that still were chasing a dream.

Don't give that fucking murderer an audience.

It would help if you understood just the basics of trading and how it works in percentages and not in absolutes.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:53:28
Grandest of delusions.

Because FIAT won't lose 50 % of its value in the next two weeks.

You are full of shit. But I bet you'd be able to prove it with your trade history.

You can't go higher from here. All those billions and billions from average Joe evaporated over the last year. He got burnt and he won't be back for this pyramid scheme. The only people that are still in it are the ones that are believers and the ones that are looking for believers to buy their remaining coins so they can finally get out completely. The reason why it only knows one direction is because there's more sellers than buyers.

As long as people are still expecting it to reach old highs again, it hasn't fallen enough.

Agreed, $100K market capitalization is Bitcoin's next stop.

FUD is the most FUD thing ever. It's literally an invention of people to not have to accept the harsh reality.

Hedge funds are shorting Bitcoin left and right.

Except you don't need any token or coin to create a blockchain. You can simply make your own, using existing data centers.

You know you screwed up when you still haven't realized that we haven't seen the minimum of 2018 yet. See you at 2500.
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:51:53
Because they want it. These are the same idiots that said the same shit at 10K and at 9K and at 8K and now at 4300. Truth is it can never get that high again. The selling pressure would already be too high at 6K. Cause all the smart people sold high and buy low. And when the HODLers will still preach because they are still deep in losses we will have made another 60 %. Never fall in love with an investment. Make it your bitch. And throw it away when you have to. There is no easy way to get rich, sorry, you fell for lies. You have to work for it. And learn some chart analysis, could've prevented you a ton of losses.

Buy gold until end of the year, then buy Bitcoin for the first three weeks in January. Unless you want to lose even more money.
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:30:58
But you would never know. They still exist, only they are not accessible anymore. But you can't tell if it is lost or just not traded.

Bro, you don't need to be a psychic to see what I am seeing.
