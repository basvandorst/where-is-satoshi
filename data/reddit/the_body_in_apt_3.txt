Thanks. That was a great article. It answered my question perfectly!

Right. But I mean instead of trying to brute force the key to one specific wallet, you just brute force the key to *any* wallet. That was supposed to be the difference between sentence 1 and 2, not looking for one specific 12 word phrase but any 12 word phrase that was connected to a wallet. I just worded it differently for the 2nd part.

I know both things are brute forcing. I just worded them differently to avoid sounding repetitive. 
There is a difference between brute forcing one specific wallet and any wallet with coins in it. The odds of getting a hit on a specific wallet are 1:2^256. The odds of getting a hit on *any* wallet with coins in it would be (number of wallets in existence with coins):2^256. But all the articles I've ever read talk about how hard it is for someone to brute force your specific wallet. My question was about how different the odds are since there are so many wallets out there (and that number will just keep rising probably). 
I do seem to have worded it poorly, and I apologize for that. It was late.
I got good answers though. It turns out that 2^256 is such a massive number that there's almost no way for enough wallets to be created for a computer to *ever* land on a non-unique key/12 word seed by brute force (though that still doesn't make sense in my mind, like the way supposedly every time you shuffle a deck of cards the order they end up in is the first time a deck of cards has ever been in that order because the sheer number of combinations is so great - it's just hard to grasp the concept of numbers that big). 
The other part is that it's just not worth doing. All the electricity used to try to brute force it would be far more valuable if just used to mine. So that's actually the biggest security feature.

We don't need banks as that term implies right now. All banking could be done P2P if the proper platforms were developed. There's no need for some asshole to get rich off of charging everyone exorbitant interest and all kinds of other scammy banker tricks.

2013 - 2015 show a very similar pattern to 2017 - 2019. Crypto seems oddly cyclic. It's probably a mix of coincidence and real market forces, but man do I hope that it continues and 2021 has a bar that goes way up off the page.

Why go back to when BTC was a dollar? Go back to when you could get thousands of BTC for a dollar!

I doubt it will be the rich people paying in America though.

You're insane! It will be at $723,547.34 and not a penny higher.

Seems like we've crossed it four times just in the past 24 hours. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:09:01
Lol, yeah. We were saying the same about people who bought at $1k back in 2013. What suckers they must feel like!

As opposed to FOLC, which is the fear of loose clowns.

You guys must have really long lunches.

Yeah, this was my take on it too. But I think that the price is rising in the longer term. When it got down around $3000, that was the floor. Unless there's some kind of catastrophe, I don't think we'll ever see prices that low again. 
What I'm saying is that now is a good time to buy. I think this is just the typical post-bull run dip. I think we'll be above $10k by the end of summer, if not earlier. 
This is just based on my gut feeling, from buying and selling the past six years. I don't have any real research to back it up with - but like everyone you can find data to support whatever you think will happen. It's still just a guessing game in reality. 
But I do think we hit bottom a few months ago and are on the way back up, and personally I think $100k bitcoins aren't that far off. I don't even think about anything like day trading anymore, because that's just gambling IMO. Long term I think it's smart to be buying (and hodling) all the bitcoin you can afford right now.

Congrats! I've been a member a bunch of times but right now I'm only at about 0.75 of a full BTC. But I'm using this dip to buy as much as I can afford and trying to get back up to at least a full bitcoin before the next spike.

I think the kids call them "thots" now.
