Nope. BTC is a digitized centralized ledger, a problem that is already solved. It's only innovation was it facilitated illegal transactions, transfers. A law requiring for identity and records management will kill that little advantage BTC had.

To say Bitcoin will be the only coin in this scenario, is utterly naive. There is nothing about Bitcoin to have a monopoly in the CryptoCurrency World.
Brand, Trust, Asset-Backing can all be added to any cryptocoin with sufficient money, luck, innovation and plain-old marketing. (Buy Adwords with GoogleCoin and get 5% off and boom all Google users are using GoogleCoin; Use DisneyCoin for a great Disney Theme park experience)
If a Payment Processing system can accept Bitcoin, it sure can hell accept any of the million other coins. If an exchange can facilitate Bitcoin trade, it sure can hell make any Virtual Currency trade happen. There is no network effect. There is no first mover advantage. There is no infrastructure that is being uniquely built for Bitcoin. There is no proprietary algorithm.

Bitcoin adds zero value to purchasers (In fact it is a massive hassle).
Currently, Bitcoin merchants has around ~1% transaction costs (vs 2.7% w Credit Cards). This is because the processors are eating away additional costs (volatility, infrastructure). Eventually these processor will have to make money and raise transaction costs or go bust.

OK, I'll give you a hint.

Well Coinbase has an unsustainable business model then. Between the three(Customers, Retailers, Transaction processors), someone has to bear the currency risk, the volatility risk and the transaction cost.
And these things have to be spread over a very thin % of sales 0.03% (i.e there are no economies of scale for this to be even break-even let alone profitable).
I'm not even taking into account the additional tax, book-keeping burden on the retailer or the extra steps the customer has to take just to buy stuff that they already used by buy with one-click.

Block reward is the one that covers a significant % the electricity cost (and setup cost) for the miners. 
Electricity costs doesn't magically disappear in the future.
Miners have to be rewarded one way or the other and that current cost is ~$25.
Bottomline, BTCers haven't thought through this problem. It is good for high margin transactions (drugs and money laundering, but is an absolute disaster for regular commerce).
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:00:58
Discounts are there not because of Bitcoin, because Marketers have figured out they can target a segmented market using 'Bitcoin'.
Merchants still have to pay ~1% transaction fee. However, the processors are eating extra costs (Volatility and Infrastructure). They can do that now because they are eating VC's money. But eventually they have to become profitable on their own and that's when you'll get the true transaction cost (which I think is close to 2%)

Bonus Answer:
c) Not many people have had the enlightenment that Cryptocurrencies are operating in a perfect market with perfect competition.

Costless Transactions? Every transaction if not traded in listed currency (say US$ in US) has the following risks
1) Currency Volatility Risk for the Buyer
2) Currency Conversion Costs for the Buyer
3) Transaction Risk (The Seller or Buyer may not deliver the actual good or services as promised)
4) Transaction Costs (The actual cost of transferring the money, including maintaining and securing the system)
5) Currency Conversion Costs for the Seller
6) Currency Volatility / Hedge Costs for the Seller
7) Book-keeping costs for Taxes, Reporting purposes.
I'm not even adding the monetary risks phenomenon (Where People hoard Bitcoins when Bitcoin is raising thus plunging the Bitcoin GDP).
All these are lessons learned over 1000s of years of History of Money. Most of them are almost natural laws (like Transaction Risks)
It looks like most Bitcoin fans have no clue about any of this and think Bitcoin is somehow protected from laws of nature and think Bitcoin magically solve all these natural problems.

As young people move out of their basements and get real jobs and have to start transacting with $$$, it will go further down.
Others will realize that Bitcoin is not an investment vehicle, and an asset is something that produces dividends/income and move on to real investments.
As VC funded exchanges and payment companies implode after not meeting the rosy forecasts (see chart above about $ transactions), people will realize BTC was a bubble and not safe at all.

Deflationary Spiral happened in the 1930s (sticking to Gold Standard exacerbated it).
Printing money at zero-bound is not the same as Printing money during inflation (due to loss of productive capacity).
Not a single economist proposes Printing money when the economy is operating at full capacity.
OTOH, plenty of clueless Austrian idiots (Ron, Peter, Grant) don't / can't understand concepts like productive capacity of nations, zero-lower bound etc. That's why they always scream Weimer, Zimbabwe &amp; Argentina. They are pretty much clueless about economic concepts. That's why they get everything wrong.
Ron Paul has been screaming hyperinflation since the 1970s. Yet not a single person questions him being wrong for the past 45 years. Peter Schiff has been screaming US collapse for 28 years now. But, a cult religion always has that advantage, leaders get a free pass on everything.

No Bitcoin being divisible doesn't solve the fundamental behavior economics problem.
i.e Wages are sticky.
If there is shortage of currency, prices will drop. But, here's where classic equilibrium economics fail.
If a company loses 10% revenue due to prices falling. They cut 10% workforce (instead of cutting 10% wages) which in turn leads to further demand depression which in turn leads to prices falling and laborforce reduction.
So, instead of equilibrium (which would have been achieved by wage cut), we get a negative vicious loop. That's why we need to print money to maintain equilibrium.
Again, lessons learned 100 years ago. Yet, this subreddit behaves as though they have found a magic elixir of monetary nirvana.

Bitcoin doesn't magically solve the 10000 year problem of Transaction risk. If you are not eating that risk, processors or buyers will have to eat.
But, Bitcoin has additional processing cost (which is greater than CC processing, because it takes more energy to process 1c worth of transaction), Currency Volatility cost and Decentralizing cost (i.e they don't get economies of scale advantages of Customer Support, Legal costs, Regulatory costs like Visa/MC).
Basically, Bitcoin is an incredibly expensive processing system (compared to CCs). It is just a matter of who will eat that cost.

And if 10% of the work-force is cut, what'll happen to the demand and the revenues of corporations? How will they respond? Yep, 10% cut in labor again, which in turn kills revenues. How will they respond to that? You get the point? (or do you I have to explain it like you are an Austrian Economist, i.e even slower?)

I can't predict prices (No one can). I'm just presenting the model of the world and the forces acting on Bitcoin. However, if you put a gun to my head, I'll say the long-term stable price will be &lt;$250 (with a 20-25% chance of &lt;$25).
This doesn't mean, it won't shoot to $1000 short term. This market is so illiquid, that it only takes a couple of crazy guys with a few thousand bucks to bid up the price to a very high level.

No it doesn't. I'm guessing you don't understand General Computing vs Computing for BTC.
A Visa Server is operating at 50% or 25%. So, an extra CPU operation doesn't cost extra electricity.
A Mining Server is operating at full capacity. An extra CPU operation need that extra electricity. BTC was designed that way. You need to spend CPU to verify a transaction.

Let's say, you decide to buy at Amazon using Visa today. What additional cost Visa has to take to process your transaction?
Hint: It doesn't have to solve math problems, or 'spend' electricity/CPU to process it. All the infrastructure is already built.
In other words, the cost statement for today's operation for Visa will be exactly the same to the last cent whether you decide to buy or not buy today.

Sorry, you can't borrow in BTC. 
**This is the fundamental concept people miss**.
When Banks gives you a Credit Card, it literally prints money and gives it you.
**If the Bank has to lend you BTC, it has to Borrow it from someone else**
In a BTC world
Credit == Savings
In a Fiat World
Credit == (15x..25x) Savings (depending on the risk perceived).
Let me put it this way.
Let's say, NASA claims that they can build a perpetual energy machine that will supply all energy for all humanity, but costs $50 Trillion $$$ to build.
In a BTC (fiatless) economy, you have to wait everybody to save $50 Trillion (and not spend on anything else) in their Savings account and then give it to NASA. (say in 25 years)
In a Fiat economy, Bank can easily calculate how it is a massively +ve NPV project, print 50 Trillion and give it to NASA. (right now)
The world quickly learnt that there is mis-match in investment and timing horizons and introduced the wonderful concept of Fiat. Unfortunately, Bitcoiners want to re-learn that very important lesson.

Why do you want to bring the Interest Rate several notches up, unless there is inflation? This is classic clueless Austrian logic.
"When Interest rates go up"?. They have no clue about the conditions that would cause it. So, let me explain.
Interest rates go up, when the economy is operating at full capacity and the demand for resources (labor, raw materials) are at peak. Currently, that would be an US economy of $20 T. 
Economies operating at full capacities are a good thing. Sure, there will be business downturn when rates have gone up, just like every business cycle in the past 250 years. 
Nobody ever claimed full elimination of business cycles.

- Bridges, Buildings, Roads need Capital Investment (Credit) first before they start producing.

If people expects Bitcoin's value to go up, they'll hoard BitCoins (thus limiting the circulation of Bitcoin, which in turn leads to a crash in the BitCoin economy).
This is a natural law. BitCoin can be a store of value or currency, not both. The lessons were learnt from the Gold Standard, 100 years ago. That's why USD is used as currency and US Bonds as store of value (through interest rates)
Plus despite a concentrated effort of a mis-information campaign from the Libertarians, US Dollar has been remarkably stable for the past 30 years. 
The fundamental philosophy of Bitcoin is not new. People have been predicting dollar crash ever since 1913. However, a cult will never question why they have been so wrong for so many years.

1) A currency is backed by underlying productive capacity. US capacity is $17 Trillion and growing in every imaginable industry (from energy to cars to technology to software to commodities to food)
2) Sorry, you don't know how to read that graph nor understand that the country with abundance and excessive capacity can print away a lot more than you can imagine.
3) Bitcoin solves nothing. It helps digitizing 'cash' transactions (i.e drugs and hookers). But unless you want to take a 1% transaction cost or waste your time verifying that the correct BTC was deducted from your purchase( was it 0.0000017 or 0.00000175 at Monday 12:35pm). It is a dumb way to waste your time. 
4) You seriously have no clue about the depth, the breadth, the diversity, the strength of the USD and the vulnerability of BTC. It takes only $1,000,000 to crash BTC. There are over a 50 Million people with that kind of money. It is incredibly dumb to bet on a currency that can be crashed by any one person. OTOH, no single country can nudge the USD let alone crash it.

There aren't in the business of watching their money burn in front of them. They don't mind that in the initial unknown-risk stage or hyper-growth stage. But at this point, BitPay has all the important metrics that the VC's look to and they would be pretty much mulling their next steps.

Transaction processors pool this risk and hence centralization is highly efficient, because Math.
