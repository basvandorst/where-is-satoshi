Are you really surprised that someone succeeded in their career?

I intended the marketer to be the person succeeding at their career, and context would suggest it'd be the person demonstrating flight booking...

I think that it's because the NSA is supposed to be a safe barrier that is hard to get into. Any use of NSA data / tools is supposed to be authorized on a case by case basis for use by the CIA, so it would make sense that they'd rather have direct access to those kinds of tools without needing to authorize access to NSA tech.
I'm sure that the authorization process is lazy and not much of a barrier anyway, but this is my guess on why they'd want internal tech. Also, maybe there are plans to move NSA responsibilities over to CIA or something?

- You don’t rely on Amazon for any additional “trust” here
- Private keys can be encrypted and decrypted on the fly if stored in something like Amazon KMS or if you roll your own storage mechanism.
- Disks can be encrypted (both physical and virtual) so you can store keys there
- I would suggest that an AWS network gives much *more* control. Virtualized hardware firewalls, ability to alter hardware on the fly at an hourly rate, etc.
Banning AWS users is not a good idea. It’s the same concept as if you were to ban Intel CPUs. It’s a weird flavor of DRM that limits the freedom of your users to use things as they see fit and it is unreasonable that this would be happening in a supposedly decentralized way.
Even in cases where your threat model were to be exploited here, assuming someone doesn’t follow any of that, it’s still not even a super high risk issue for the ecosystem as a whole.
The issue of BTC not being decentralized seems like the most reasonable issue here, but - even then - mapping BTC to physical location isn’t really going to make a difference at the end of the day. If you’re decentralized in terms of protocol then location doesn’t really matter when every client has a copy of the chain. Thats the actual goal, right?

One like of nothing is better than many lines of bullshit.

I think you're talking so much that you may have forgotten how to listen :(
