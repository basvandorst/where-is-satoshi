I love my Bitcoin, spent .0178 BTC today on fried chicken and a lemonade.  But Doge is fun.

Great notebooks!  Seems like a lot of folks have this problem with Bitcoin transactions not integrating into their existing systems.  Squarespace, shopify and others need to make it easier.

Nope, not that I know of.

Thanks all for the great vids!  We're putting together a weekly Bitcoin fair,   Starts June 15th, if anyone is around NYC please come by!

Hi, I'm part of Hester.  Those pics are only promotional.  Vendors are not accepting Bitcoins yet.  But we're planning something big for mid June:)

There was a vendor that had shopify setup to take bitcoin but she was not able to process bitcoin transactions in person.  The icon was there but would not work.  Not sure if its just a config problem or its only available over internet transactions.

Thanks a lot everyone! It's a weekly event so we have time to grow it.

What about this? 
@_date: 2014-01-22 17:25:54
But what is a "slot on a ledger" worth if there are almost an infinite number of slots (as Bitcoins are divisible up to 8 decimal points)?  If you can use the smallest unit possible to move data, contracts, etc. around. Can someone explain this?

Thanks.  Yeah looking for something that has a lot of the promotional aspect but also some technical stuff to help get the big picture.

Awesome, we could definitely use any help we can get.  Email me at info

Am I barking up the wrong tree?
