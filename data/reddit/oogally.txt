I think that means it's currently priced appropriately according to its long term rate of appreciation.  It's definitely worth more than  $3600, which would be 1.47 x price 200 days ago.

Where does the centralization in lightning network argument originate?  I don't see how it would lead to centralization.  It is taking on risk in your funds (to an extent) in that you have to monitor channels to avoid having them closed with an old state, but that's the only downside that I see.  I would think that given the ease of competition and the distribution of coins, LN would be quite decentralized though.

In that case, the closest you'll probably get is a custodied solution.  Even the simple options will take a little setup on the user's part if you want to use LN unless you rely on a third party to do it for you.  If you're just looking to get a node running easily, there's a few options - casa, nodl, or pierre rochard's launcher, but no, I don't believe there are any plug and play LN PoS terminals out there.  Go ahead and Buidl.

I think your level of exposure should correlate with your knowledge of the protocol and ecosystem and experience and comfort in the space.  For someone who's done plenty of research and experienced the wild market cycles a 10-15% exposure doesn't seem unreasonable.  If you're looking at bitcoin as an investment, I think you should consider at least a 5 year time horizon.

Well, scaling (Eth2, sharding) has been "a couple months away" for years now.  It could happen soon, but at this point, I'm skeptical.  More power to them all the same.  I have a small stake in ETH and think it's at least an interesting experiment, but a federated sidechain is clearly easier to implement and works with greater privacy and throughput now.

They don't literally take it from the press, but when you give the biggest banks 0% loans - "Here, take this $10B and invest it in something," while the rest of the populace is paying 3% for their mortgage (financed by the bank with a free loan), where do you think the net flow of money goes?  This is what they did with the federal funds interest rate.  They then proceeded to buy up bad securities owned by the banks when it appeared they were over-leveraged in risky assets.  If you're a bank of decent size, you basically can't lose.  They're encouraged to keep this behavior though, because our economy is essentially driven by debt expansion, and to stop that trend would send a shockwave through it.

You can take a look at his model data and thesis here:
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:59:57
Hi Adam,  
  
Here's my take. The rise is due to basic supply side economics.  The demand was initially created by ideological types who wanted a more transparent, trustless, democratic form of currency.  It saw further adoption by those who saw it as a way out of hyperinflating local currencies (Venezuela et. al), and now price is increasingly being driven by speculation on an appreciating asset (a new class of asset at that).
  
I think we'll see more volatility and dips after recent gains, but the overall trend will continue upward due to the same economic principles until it gradually slows to steady state.
  
I think a very small portion of the mainstream financial sector understands Bitcoin, but for the most part they lack the perspective to understand its real utility/value. (They benefit from living in a stable country with reasonable access to banking and financial instruments.)  It's simply not as revolutionary for them as it is for the under served and repressed, so from that standpoint it appears only as a speculative bubble.
  
In my view, if all it does is empower the oppressed and give them financial agency on the global stage, then it's a net positive regardless of price movement. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:34:10
I agree completely, but my one concern is the feedback loops involved.  The only feedback you get on decentralization is when an entire chain gets co-opted.  I imagine those will be rare and dramatic events which could generate a lot of turmoil in the entire space.  
  
It's sort of like forest fires - small grass fires now and then are healthy and clear out undergrowth, but if there's not that constant feedback mechanism, the whole forest can go up at once.  Many of the other aspects of cryptocurrencies have much more direct feedback (speed, network effect, capacity, etc.).  I suppose seeing more of the smaller coins get centralized or co-opted is the best feedback we can get here to keep us appreciating what we have in terms of decentralization.
@_date: 2019-07-08 13:13:29
I'm glad you shared this perspective.  I wouldn't push for a 300kB restriction either, but I think Luke makes a point worth considering - that the IBD time is forecast to increase for the average user for a significant number of years before technology and connectivity catch up enough to start reducing this friction point.  It's not just the present moment we should consider, but also what impact consensus choices will have for the coming years.  We could learn from ethereum and others in this regard.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:20:31
I agree with this view. It would be great if the IRS could just collect a form 1099 as with a traditional brokerage, but that's not what they're after here.  The longer they wait to provide clear guidance to individuals and exchanges the worse the problem of tax reporting and collection will get.
I am also troubled by the overreach here - this coming from a patriotic individual who believes in the necessity for social cooperation (and taxes).  I see this as just an inefficient means of collecting information that potentially puts my personal information at additional risk to hacks/leaks because of all the extra data generated.
The other thing that's funny to me is the implication that they expect BTC holders to convert back to fiat (there haven't been enough capital gains filed!) Why would I want to cash out my retirement savings and best investment?

True - it's quite complicated.  My comment was more to do with Chomsky's history of political dogmatism and strawmanning any argument which opposes his own.

I would be interested in how you calculate your capital gains tax when you pay your bills from BTC.  This is the first year I'll have to worry about that, but keeping a huge spreadsheet just to file taxes doesn't sound fun.  We need some wallets with that feature built in.

I would probably start with Andreas' *Mastering Bitcoin*.  I haven't gone through it myself, but he produces pretty accessible content, and this one has a technical focus.  *Programming Bitcoin* by Jimmy Song might be good too.
If you want less technical, there's the monetary aspect and Austrian economics, for which *The Bitcoin Standard* is excellent.  *The Spider and the Starfish* isn't about bitcoin at all, but delves into decentralize organizations, which is also important to understand in this context.
Outside of books, Jameson Lopp curates a pretty good page of [information](  Andreas Antonopolous has a pretty good range of info in his various presentations as well.  You can find his content on [Youtube]( or in his books, *The Internet of Money 1 &amp; 2*.

For me it's more of a timing issue.  I sat tight through the run-up of 2017 and then through the correction of 2018.  I think the bears will run out of steam soon enough, but I'm going to give it until spring and accumulate some more then (if prices are still enticing).  I think we'll have pretty good odds of having the worst behind us at that point, and I doubt we see a break-neck takeoff in the recovery.  Everyone will be disenfranchised enough that sentiment will take a while to come around.
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:53:37
Oh, good point, time frame should definitely be 3-5 years minimum (holds true for most investments, but this one more so).

I wouldn't recommend putting all your eggs in one basket unless you only have one egg, then knock yourself out.  I.e., I wouldn't put all your saving into crypto unless its a small amount and you're young, but I can't stop you.
  
Dollar cost average - put say 10% in per month and spread it out. Don't FOMO, you've got time.  Perhaps a couple alts wouldn't hurt just from a diversification standpoint, but BTC is the most conservative and probably safest, so I would focus there.  
  
As far as timing is concerned - it's a fools errand to try and time the market (let alone time it perfectly).  I think prices are reasonable for someone looking to get in now, but they may be better over the next few months and into early next year.  Again, if you take it slow you're unlikely to be disappointed in the result.

Last three month span is outlined below.  
  
June 24, 2018:  $5900USD
  
Sept 24, 2018:  $6600USD
  
High of $8274 on July 24, low of $5845 on June 24.  That's a +25%, -12% window of our current price over three months.  In terms of bitcoin volatility over a three month span, it seems pretty tame to me, but I guess it's all relative.
@_date: 2018-09-03 11:39:09
I would say it's too late to see the crazy gains of the last eight years, but it's still an appreciating asset that should do well.  I think it balances out investment in stocks quite nicely because it's uncorrelated, and will likely outperform them for some time yet.  I think eventually bitcoin will look (from an investing standpoint) more like gold and more or less maintain its value fairly in a fairly stable manner - the difference is you can easily spend it across the world.

Valid points, but also homes are also feeling the McMansion creep.  I'm sure a plot going back further would continue the trend, but 1700sqft in 1970s vs 2500sqft today means real estate should get more expensive at least in terms of raw materials input.

@_date: 2018-09-12 14:51:00
Could happen, but I see the slope decreasing on the log chart over time.  I.e., the time it takes the price to double, on average, is increasing.  I would rather plot is as something like:  
  
Price = $0.00846 * (Year - 2009) ^ 6  
  
This forms a straight line on a log-log chart.  Price still increases massively, but the effect is reduced over time.  $100K around 2024, and $1M around 2031.  With the cyclical nature of price, the milestones will probably be hit earlier than those dates - that's just an average for the price.  Then again, with the increasing rate of technology adoption, who knows - might be way off.

Miners generally include the transactions that pay the best in terms of satoshi/byte.  It's a free market so if there's a large unconfirmed transaction backlog (mempool), demand goes up and prices go up.  
  
The new block is correct if the hash meets the current difficulty threshold.
@_date: 2018-09-14 12:10:26
There are counterpoints to all of these problems:  
  
1) Layer 2 scaling - see lightning network for a good example.  This is how we'll allow enough transaction throughput to have a large population regularly spending bitcoin on everyday purchases.  Lightning network is not dependent upon block times (settlement takes milliseconds) and there is no possibility of a double spend.
  
2) Sub-satoshi fees already supported by lightning network.  
  
3) The decimal place is fairly arbitrary anyway, and, as bitcoin is a living protocol, can changed via hardfork if there is an overwhelming consensus (by the time it's an issue, I'm sure most would support such a change).  
  
4) There may be faster or more anonymous coins (again, LN tends to solve both these in one fell swoop), but to call a coin better typically ignores the tradeoffs between speed, decentralization, and security.  It's very difficult to optimize for all three of those required aspects simultaneously, and historically, bitcoin has had some of the best and most numerous developers working on it to do just that.
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:49:29
Absolutely - bank the unbanked.
@_date: 2018-09-24 16:42:04
I would say if you've got more than 3x the cost of a Ledger (or Trezor) in bitcoin, private keys should be kept on a hardware wallet.  That's somewhere in the ballpark of $200-$300.

I have no idea as I've only heard of anecdotal evidence.  I think Dash is gaining in popularity now that BTC has appreciated so much (and probably for privacy features as well).  I know that cryptocurrency has made a huge difference for at least a handful of people there and I think that's something meaningful. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:42:08
I wouldn't encourage anyone to invest who doesn't understand the basic principles of the technology.  It was never meant to be a ponzi or get rich quick scheme.  That's just free market economics at work that make it appear that way.  Steady state will gradually be reached at which point price will only move in relation to scarcity, population growth, and instability of other world currencies.  By all means, if you don't like it, please don't invest - there are plenty of Venezuelans and Greeks who do appreciate its merits.
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:49:08
Depends on your configuration (such as number of connected nodes), but I would count on at least 200GB/month between it and a bitcoin node.  You don't have to run a full node in conjunction, but it generally makes sense.  
  
Keep in mind, this is for a routing node.  You don't have to run a routing node if you just want to be able to pay.  My data is based off of one month of usage, so please take it with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:34:42
My concern is that to scale for the real masses, we're likely to need a 3rd layer solution.  I don't have all the right numbers to do the math, but try calculating how long it would take 5B people to open 3 LN channels each. I'm figuring the first person to do it will be long dead before the last opens their channels.  Maybe you leave your LN channel in your will?  
  
Don't get me wrong, I'm excited for the lightning network, but we're still going to need more than that to reach massive user adoption.
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:30:05
True, which is why these periodic purges occur.
@_date: 2018-09-11 17:56:01
Well, it is on mainnet - you can use it today to transact and buy real things.  I'm not sure who's working on atomic multipath payments or what the timeframe may be, but that should substantially increase the size of transactions that can be routed.  Also, I imagine LN will grow a lot the next time we see a substantial increase in TX fees.  
  
It's not the easiest to setup a node, but if I can do it, I'm fairly confident you can too.  This should also get more streamlined over time.  
  
UI development should help some, and on that note: there's [this from LND](

Get it the same as with cash - accept it for goods or services.  Unfortunately, for this use case it's probably going to require lightning network (or other layer 2 tech) before we can achieve meaningful scale and volume to get access to developing countries.  It's undergoing rapid development, but probably not ready for the kind of use case we're discussing.  Perhaps if we're just discussing it in terms of an infrequently accessed savings account, layer 1 bitcoin would still be reasonable.

I believe the latest bolt specification allows multiple routes for a single transaction - so say you have an invoice for $200, it could feasibly be split into 4 $50 routes and they either all go through or don't.  I think at least one of the wallets already supports this, but it will definitely be a standard feature before 2025.  Also, given price appreciation, wider adoption of LN, etc., channel limits will surely be higher by then as well.

I think he has a better argument in another video where he goes into detail on why proof of stake doesn't create the same Nash equilibrium that proof of work does.  
  
The gist of it was that at some point there needs to enter a factor of randomness in conjunction with the block validation.  I believe the randomness was used to assign the next opportunity to validate a block.  If you have enough computing power, you're basically incentivized to use it to ensure that the 'randomness' ends up with you getting the opportunity to validate the next block, and the next, and the next.  You can see where the problem goes.

Yes, lots of speculation going on, but given that at least some people do use it as a store of value, its price must go up to compensate.  Given that, and an improving track record of the protocol, why would people not speculate?  It seems to me that the price is explained quite well by low liquidity and abundant speculation.

You know efficiency has no correlation to energy usage in bitcoin, right?  If we make mining twice as efficient, the laws of supply and demand will just make the hashrate double and energy consumption stay the same.  So long as it's cost effective to plug in more miners (based on the payout), it will be done.  The only aspects counteracting this are 1) price of bitcoin relative to electricity and 2) block reward - which decreases over time - and mining fees.  
  
The fundamental problem is that, in order to solve [the Byzantine General's Problem]( something of value must be sacrificed to confirm a block.  An early concept was the coin itself (proof-of-stake), which would not involve consuming electricity, however, that system can be taken advantage of.  The most secure method is proof-of-work, which burns an external, universally valued resource, electricity.  It's not great, but it works, is secure, and is fair.  Let's be thankful that much of the power behind it currently comes from renewable resources.

An exchange traded fund (ETF) is an instrument to issue stocks which represent other assets.  The underlying asset can comprise of anything - real estate investments, stocks in a basket of companies, commodities (gold), etc.  
  
I've used them as an easy way to invest in S&amp;P500 index companies for instance.  It's easier to purchase 1 ETF stock than 500 different ones and have to rebalance them constantly.  This is the typical application, and it's really useful for retirement funds, 401Ks, 529 (education savings), etc.  
  
The ETF is anticipated because it would allow an "easy" way for non-technical savers to invest in Bitcoin in a tax-advantaged way.  This would surely increase demand and the price of BTC.  By the same token, it would also concentrate some power in the ETF manager (in the case of deciding which fork to support, etc.).  Other criticisms include a lack of ability of the investors to actually use their coin, security concerns, and pushing bitcoin further towards being a speculative asset instead of a currency.

Well, you're in a subreddit full of early adopters.  People complained about the internet in 1992 as well, but somehow it's become a thing (despite being slow, not having a lot of users, too complicated to use).  Have you actually tried using bitcoin though?  I've used a couple mobile wallets (mainnet and LN) which are both remarkably easy to use - granted running your own full node is not quite so straightforward.  I would legitimately rank it faster and easier than an online credit card transaction.
  
Your other concerns have also been addressed as well.  What's wrong with energy consumption?  It's the most reliable way to secure the network.  It comes predominately from renewable sources - opens up energy arbitrage which has been a boon to wind, hydro and geothermal projects all over the world.
  
Your ponzi scheme complaint is the most legimate in my view, but even here, proof-of-work allows anyone to mine new bitcoin without paying to acquire it from someone else.  If you don't value any of BTC's benefits, then don't participate, but for some it's a game-changer.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:05:28
Well, somewhat unfortunately, it's likely to make your taxes easier.  Say there's a chain split - the ETF fund can either keep both chains' coins, or sell one to buy more of the other.  In either case, your ETF share price has now increased without you having to do anything, or declare taxable gains.  As with other ETFs, you would only have to pay taxes when you actually sell your ETF share for a profit.  
  
On the other hand, you can't actually access or use the funds - you can only sell your ETF share through your broker.  It also doesn't encourage holders/investors to run their own node, signal a BIP (as occurred with UASF), or do any of the other things which might make one a responsible bitcoin citizen.
@_date: 2018-08-15 16:28:21
Maybe ELI15, but I tried:  
  
Lots of speculators have leveraged short positions on bitcoin - they borrowed money to bet that bitcoin will drop in price.  There are so many of them, that if the price goes up a bit, it will trigger a wave of liquidations (where the brokerage says "you bet wrong and now you owe us too much money - we're closing your bet, now please pay us everything you have left").  
  
The short sellers closing their bets basically guarantees that the price will go up, because they have to buy back BTC (shorting means they borrowed BTC in the first place).  Lots of buying leads to price spike.

Why would you want to eliminate dips?  Is there even a single investment that never dips in value?  My point is that, like other long-term stores of value, (gold/bonds/maybe real estate) it just needs to appreciate over a reasonable time-span most of the time.  With bitcoin, from all the historical data available from coinmarketcap, it's come out ahead in any given 2 year stretch for 86% of it's history.  That seems pretty reasonable when compared to alternative stores of value.

I'm not much for conspiracy theories, but with the economics of developing an asic miner, it makes sense, if you have spent a load of money developing a more efficient product, to use it for mining yourself at a profit unachievable by your competition.  I have no idea if there are any unpublicized miners out there now contributing to hashrate, I just wouldn't be at all surprised if it happens at some point.  I would think such an event would also lead to a seemingly incongruous network hashrate.  
  
Then again, maybe miners are just optimistic and see more upside potential than downside.
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:46:58
Nah, it can be both - maybe doesn't make a lot of sense to you and me, but in more corrupt parts of the world with highly unstable currencies it can actually be an improvement.  Those will be the real proving grounds for a currency scenario, then it will gradually spread to slightly better off locales.  You and I should count ourselves lucky that bitcoin is something we don't need out of necessity.  If, in the end, it only serves as an opt-out to economies of extreme corruption and dictatorships, then I'm okay with that.

If you can guarantee it dropping 10%, then yes.  Also, if you can do that, please let me know in advance.  
  
Generally in markets, the big dogs or those with insider knowledge stand to benefit the most from timing trades like this.  It only takes one whale who can afford a little better research/analysis, or who can move the whole market to wipe out a whole bunch of smaller traders trying to do the same.  Most who try to time the markets do worse than just dollar cost averaging or letting it ride.  
  
To answer your last question, from my perspective the market looks about three times as good for a buyer now than it did in November/December.  Better news, better tech advancements, cheaper price.  Sure, it may drop lower yet, but the downside is a lot smaller now than it was at $19K.

I think you have it backwards, DCA is about investing in markets that appreciate in general while being completely agnostic to bubbles and short term fluctuations.

The vast majority of all traders would be better served by DCA than trying to time a trade.

Segwit was a protocol upgrade which expanded the block size limit.  In the case of 2 of 2 multisig transactions (since we were discussing LN), it allows for roughly twice as big of blocks as we had prior to July 2017.  
  
Here's a [2.1MB block]( to illustrate the point, or the latest block - [1.2MB](  
  
There was originally no limit, but due to network spam, it was capped at 1MB to give the network time to sync and reduce the rate of uncles, in 2017 the limit was increased.

I agree that currency is used as a unit of account, but if you're trying to argue that it's not viewed as an asset, then good luck.  If money was purely a unit of account, then why do we see such a proliferation of bills and coinage?  It's an age old and world-wide phenomenon.  There are billions of people who buy or sell goods or services directly in exchange for currency every day.  It's not purely bartering, and they have a very real expectation to take the $1 proceed from their corn sale and buy something else with that $1 tomorrow.  That's a perception of value, and I'm sorry, but there is very little inherent value in a dollar bill - you can't eat it, drink it, or use it to shoe a horse.

Using envelope math, I estimate we would need block sizes roughly 1000 times larger if it were to be a globally used currency (this is just estimating opening and closing 3 or 4 LN channels per year per person). 
It seems like a major problem now, but thankfully it's not up to just me to find a solution that can scale. What I find more concerning long-term is the amount of power required for PoW. We need to be consuming less energy.  I'm hopeful we'll solve both of these problems in time.

Yes, that's sort of the point of paypal, but I wouldn't be so quick to jump to this conclusion.  For one, I've actually heard a lot of horror stories about paypal (from a vendor perspective) recently.  Two: the majority of eBay sellers list a lot of items and covet their rating, so it would be counter to their own best interests to scam you.  Three: escrow would actually be pretty easy to implement now that the infrastructure for the transaction is in place.  If there's a market for it, I'm sure some businesses will pop up offering escrow services on smart contract and that could be cheaper and easier than paypal's service.

I'm not sure if that's exactly how it's likely to go down, but I could see at least some variation of that taking place.  I think we will see LN lead to more layer 2 (3?) solutions - some of them might be on different chains even.  Maybe there's a 'lightning of America' chain - so long as there's at least one node that supports it, there's no reason a channel couldn't hop between chains on the LN.  That would open up additional capacity for sure.  Hopefully we'll develop better scaling solutions than that eventually, but It's one possibility in a world where base blockchain space is a scare resource.

I think we're largely in agreement!  To clarify my stance, I think, given time, competitive services may arise which could offer, for a fixed fee, arbitration services should a dispute arise.  The novel aspect to me is that they won't even have to take custody of the funds directly but, given smart contracts, they can be responsible for adjusting the payout based on evidence from both parties.  These services will build their business by cultivating a reputation for fairness and transparency and the best part is, you don't have to worry about the third party running off with your funds (only potentially misallocating it).

I'm perhaps 80% confident of Satoshi's identity, but it's completely inconsequential, and more to the point, the best thing Satoshi did for Bitcoin was to walk away and gift its governance and control to the masses.

By your logic the Canadian dollar is also useless as a currency.  It's only supporting 0.5% of the world population, it can only handle local transactions, etc.  
  
Why are you setting the bar for bitcoin so high?  Protocol improvements won't be held to linear scaling, neither should your thinking on the subject.  
  
Neither banks nor credit card companies are themselves currencies, so why are you comparing them (second/third level scaling/liquidity/transmission solutions) to the base protocol of bitcoin.  
  
Anyway, this can all be trumped by empirical evidence - people are using bitcoin to transact in goods and services, so there is non-zero usefulness there.  
  
I think your point about non-arbitrary limitation on the protocol is reasonable.  The reality is it's not arbitrary, it a necessary restriction to ensure propagation time such that node operators can sync from anywhere in the world thus keeping decentralization.  It would be great if we could all agree to just let block sizes float such that 95% of the average internet user could run a node with their connection and hardware limitations - but that's a difficult figure to come up with on the fly - thus we have slowly adapting protocol standards which are voted on and derived by consensus - block size is one of them.

I think the motivations Buffet/Gates are pretty easy to understand.  
1 - There is a nugget of truth in the 'pyramid scheme' hyperbole.  Just like with any investment, it only goes up because more people want it in the future.  Even fiat currency follows this principle were it not for inflation typically countering it.  
2 - They've made fortunes under the legacy system.  This means both that they don't appreciate the circumstances under which cryptocurrency can be superior (avoiding rampant inflation in banana republics, non-access to banks, easy transmission, etc.) and also that they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.
If BTC or any crypto become hugely successful, I think there will be a time when, like gold, it becomes a stable and relatively boring investment.  At that point, yes, there will certainly be better investment options.  Ignoring all of the democratizing, liberating effects that would bring to the world population, however, is fairly shortsighted to say the least.

Until customers demand auditing of funds and evidence of responsible custodial security (multisignatuare wallets in the hands of multiple independent fiduciaries), these events will continue to occur.

I have no experience with monero, but I've heard it's notoriously difficult to transfer by DEX. No auditing of the blockchain means no ability to verify a transfer occurred - thus lots of scamming.  Might be easier to buy BTC, then exchange for a privacy coin if that's what you're after.  If you're looking for a DEX, bisq, localbitcoins, hodlhodl, and paxful are the major options I'm aware of (no personal experience with any of them).  Also, be aware, you'll probably need to initiate offers most of the time as these exchanges don't have market makers.

As best as I can tell, Karpeles inherited a barely-functional exchange, which was already full of flaws and security holes and he was in over his head from the start.  He comes across as meaning well, even if he was incredibly cavalier in his responsibilities while also not being up for the challenge of running the exchange as a one-man-show.
McCaleb on the other hand, just strikes me as a serial scam artist.  If I had to assign blame, I would suggest he deserves a larger apportionment - he 'sold' the business when it was already hacked and underwater, which should have been a huge red flag to any potential buyer.  I say sold in quotes because he just asked for a portion of future profits - no payment up front.  Almost seems like he wanted to absolve himself of responsibility before the music stopped (while also reaping a reward as long as it lasted).  It's at minimum an ethically very shady arrangement.  I certainly wouldn't have been able to go through with that had I been in his shoes.
I agree though, we're likely to never know the full story.

Due to memory and HD I/O limitations of the pi, the initial block download and sync will take about a month on this hardware, otherwise it's a great low power, low cost full node.  You can download and verify blocks on a higher power machine first to save time if that's a problem.  See the Stadicus guide linked below - it covers bitcoind first, then LND (lightning network).
The raspi is pretty capable, but if I had to do it over again, I'd probably use something like an odroid for twice the price, but much better performance. (Stadicus has a guide for that too)

It's clear that they are - they can't possibly be issuing loans to people, while also storing others deposits and paying interest, while also holding all those funds 100%.  It was only a matter of time before this happened (although MTGOX / QuadrigaCX operated while insolvent for quite some time, and in doing so had a fractional reserve).  In theory, there's a role for such lending, it's just that I would have to have great confidence in the institution before I would trust them with my money.
For example, if existing banks kept a 50% reserve, opened their balance sheets, were regularly audited, and were not incentivized to issue increasingly risky loans, perhaps we wouldn't be reliant on the FDIC.  As it is, they only have to hold a 10% reserve (at most) and are encouraged to issue as many aggressive loans as possible  while the cost of failure is socialized.

I take your point, but to me this is even more reason to proceed in a slower, conservative fashion and to work more on modularity of the codebase and alternative implementations.  If we can't achieve consensus, it illustrates we've already got a codebase more complex than we can understand.  At it's core, bitcoin should be a standard protocol that anyone / any code can participate in if they follow it.  Granted, we now have quirks ranging from fence post errors on up that have been baked in and will always have to be there, but still, if we're having trouble achieving consensus, all the more reason to slow down development, better understand what the existing code is doing, refactor and improve documentation, and proceed from there.

To answer 2, it's like an internet for bitcoin.  You have connections to other nodes (imagine connecting to your ISP).  Any time you want to send bitcoin, you route it through a series of other nodes until it gets to your ultimate destination.  You can connect to anywhere on the network, even though you're not directly connected to that node yourself.  The way it's routed keeps transactions private and the transactions are very fast.

I listened to this [episode of Let's Talk Bitcoin]( the other day and it had some interesting discussion of sidechains.  I think we'll significant movement in the direction of multi-tiered scaling like you're suggesting.  (Sidechains/lightning/payment channels over smartcontracts on sidechains) Bitcoin is just too valuable as an immutable base settlement layer to mess that up, but we've now seen a couple different approaches that can let us transact in the bitcoin unit of account in a secure, off-chain manner.  Exciting times IMO.

This is essentially the same argument Saifedean Ammous makes in 'The Bitcoin Standard.'  It has to be energy intensive to produce, because its only valuable in so far as it's difficult to increase the supply.  Ammous also has some great points on the value of vehicles for savings - it allows humanity to plan for the future through low time preference making investments that only pay off far into the future.  If our existing monetary policy valued savings like this, bitcoin wouldn't be nearly as desirable.  
  
Also, it's ridiculous to extrapolate energy usage.  Bitcoin is going to massively scale in transactions versus hashing power through sidechains and offchain transactions like lightning network.  The more transaction demand increases, the more scaling solutions are incentivized.  
  
Often overlooked, bitcoin has also created incredible benefits for the renewable energy market.  Remote, underutilized hydro and wind power projects now have real demand, boosting the value of renewable energy projects all over the world.  This will, in turn, spur new investment in renewable energy projects globally, some of which would not have been economically viable in a world without bitcoin.  
  
Finally, perhaps bitcoin isn't perfect, but it creates an incredible vehicle for savings and transaction that the world desperately needs, and it's the best we've currently got.  If its energy consumption is such a problem, why don't we, as a society, examine why it's desirable in the first place, look critically at why the alternatives suck, advance research on renewable energy deployment, advance scaling solutions, or contribute to any number of activities that will actually result in a positive change for our future.

Fair points.  I view at least 99% of alts as scams, and I'm not too concerned if others want to get wrapped up in them or not.  Bitcoin had a pretty unique organic genesis which can't really be recreated today, so there's that too.  
  
In terms of forks, I held BTC before the BCH fork, so my 1BTC became 1BTC + 1BCH.  Still the same fraction of ownership of the available supply - no wealth magically created or destroyed.

It's like an internet connection.  You don't sign a contract with a new ISP and run new wires to your home each time you want to access wikipedia - you just have your router connected for any time you need to send or receive data.

I would look into a lightning node for increased privacy and lower fees on small transactions.  Something like [tippin.me]( might work for you as right now you have to generate a LN invoice before a donation could be made (this capability will be added in the next year or two).
Not sure there's a great way to prove income - even if you could, I probably wouldn't want to advertise crypto wallet balances or anything.  You might be able to negotiate paying an extra month in advance if it's an issue.
Not sure how your tax system works, but generally you would be taxed on the exchange value of your local currency at the time a donation was received.  This is probably going to involve a big spreadsheet or maybe a python script.
If you want to get slightly more advanced, you can setup a BTCPay server - there are several hosts who offer 1-click deployments.  Here's the [walkthrough](  It should log all transactions for use in tax calculations or proof-of-income.

That's the idea, but in the real world people exchange bitcoin for USD, so there's bound to be some interplay.  Like it or not, the world's economy currently revolves around USD and fed policy, which operates on Keynesian economics.  Under that system, the prices of all investments fluctuate with the ability to get access to M2 supply.  
  
I don't know how much Bitcoin price will correlate with monetary supply, and this last year is the first time in Bitcoin's history we've even seen the [federal funds rate]( above 1%.  I think we're only now starting to see the effects of tightening liquidity, so it's all uncharted territory.

@_date: 2019-11-14 15:07:45
It's more than literal money printing.  Generally we're referring to expansion of the M2 monetary base, wherein major banks get loans at 0%-0.25% interest rates from the Fed.  This is in addition to their own fractional reserve lending, which further increases the M2 supply, and couldn't be perpetuated to the same extent if not for FDIC insurance and the promise of bail-outs .
If it was a fair system, why not provide that liquidity and loans under the inflation rate (free money) to everyone?  There's a privileged class that gets these cheap loans and it's basically impossible not to make money given this advantage.
To make matters worse, most of the world trades with the US, and so USD is held globally for trade and as a reserve currency.  Like BitcoinFan7 points out, these are some of the last people to see the purchasing power of their dollars erode (Cantillion effect) due to increased monetary supply.  We're essentially taxing anyone who holds USD 2%-3% per year for that privilege.  We can get away with it due to the massive amount of trade the US takes part in, and the tendency of other countries to have even worse monetary policy (i.e., in Argentina or Chile right now, a 2% annual haircut looks quite preferable to 40%-70%).
To be honest, monetary expansion is so bad, that it also completely offsets increases in human productivity, which should be something like 2% (I don't know exactly) per year.  So really our money is so soft that we are losing 4%+ every year that's essentially given away to the banks.
Wow, that rant felt good.

Why are you into bitcoin?  For me, it's a chance to hold hard money, secure, and inflation limited, which can be transmitted anywhere in the world in ~10 minutes.  Are the world's reserve banks going to suddenly stop printing money and return to sound economic policy?  Is hyperinflation in troubled economies going to suddenly stop due to the benevolence of their leadership?  Is SHA256 encryption about to be cracked?  Those are the things which would worry me about holding bitcoin.  These days, especially with deteriorating economic conditions, my bitcoin is letting me sleep like a baby.  
  
Sure, we may have another year of lackluster price performance, but no fundamentals have changed.  If anything, we're closer to halving the inflation rate again, we have improved scaling in the protocol and layer 2, and solid support for a higher price floor that has held for a year now.  I'm a patient guy and in the long run, this is the investment I'm least concerned with.

Well, you're getting out of eli5 territory, but yes, you essentially 'lock up' funds in a channel with another party and then you can send and receive as many transactions back and forth across that channel as you want.  When you're done and need the funds for an on-chain transaction you can close out the channel and have your final balance recorded on-chain.
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:57:37
It allows nearly instant, nearly feeless off-chain transactions.  It's probably a bigger deal when fees to record transaction on the blockchain are higher (they're really low at the moment).  Additionally, it grants much greater privacy.  Downsides are that it's pretty new and not so widely supported yet, and that it generally takes a persistent connection to monitor channels.  In general, it will allow bitcoin to scale better and be used for everyday transactions.  
The LN space is advancing rapidly, so stay tuned for further developments.

This struck me as improbable, so I did the math (based on 100 micron/.004" bill thickness, and 252000mi/405Mm to the moon)

Well, clearly bitcoin can be quite volatile in the short term. For long term savings I think it's the best available asset currently.  Diversification between stocks, commodities, and crypto is probably wise.  I've got hefty bags of fiat at the moment just because I expect some good buying opportunities in the next 12 months, and like it or not, it's still the most liquid, stable, short term store of value (USD).  If the market wasn't able to stay irrational for so long, I would be shorting the S&amp;P500 already.
As far as gold and precious metals, I think they will do well over the next two years, but I would rather have $50 of bitcoin and $50 cash right now than $100 in gold.
I no expert though, so make sure to DYOR.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:55:18
I measured a USD with calipers and ran with that.
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:50:32
I think  he has quite rational reasoning.  Bitcoin  is the first liquid market for a high stock/flow store of value (well, after gold, but gold has its own problems).  It's really an entirely new asset class.  Just think of the people all over the world storing their savings in USD or foreign real estate because their local currency can't be trusted (Venezuela, Argentina, China, Brazil, India).  Bitcoin is so much easier, more secure, and liquid than any other alternative and anti-inflationary to boot.  It's going to take a huge bite out of real estate and USD because of that, at which point it sort of becomes a self fulfilling prophecy - people will sell the underperforming stores of value in favor of the out-performing one - bitcoin.
Like he said, the best defense is restraint on the part of the central banks.  I'm not really seeing that happening, butt either way, we're better off.
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:54:38
Value of anything is a collective delusion.  There is no intrinsic value in the medium - paper, metal, digital bits - only what value we all choose to assign.  Clearly, enough other people are willing to trade for Bitcoin though at $6K USD each, which is 2.5X more than they were willing to trade for it one year ago.
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:22:54
This may not be a popular sentiment, but typically, in free markets, any time a pattern is established and recognized individuals and strategies target that pattern and it tends to erase itself.  I wouldn't count on it repeating much longer.
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:45:52
Hard to say, but better than even odds in my estimation.  This market cycle is already long in the tooth at 11 years.  The central banks are low on ammo, and it looks like the perfect storm brewing.  We've already had an inversion of the yield curve - usually a pretty good leading indicator of a recession.  We may already be in one, but they're typically only called in hindsight as earnings data is only released quarterly.
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:06:37
Good point in that it would still be modest when compared to all world currency, but also, I believe we're comparing bitcoin M1 to fiat M2 here.  I would say bitcoin is less inclined toward fractional reserve and custodianship, but we know they're both taking place already along with naked futures contracts (which can totally decouple price from fundamentals - at least in the short term).  If we see this trend continue substantially enough, we're going to have to start comparing bitcoin M2 to fiat M2. Yuck.

The way I see it, Bitcoin provides two things extremely well: security and scarcity.  Any time you want more bandwidth you're going to have to sacrifice on security in some form; however, with lightning network, individuals can indeed handle thousands of TX/s rather easily and it doesn't require putting the entire base chain at risk.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:12:52
Honestly, I think we HODLers are partly to blame.  The mindset of 'hold no matter what' results in low liquidity which in turn enables quick runs in the price.  Those would probably be tamped somewhat if everyone were more willing to sell when price has gone up an appreciable amount.  I think we'll see volatility continue to decrease over time.  
That said, I don't plan to sell mine, but to use it as intended.

I think Mr. Biznes is largely correct here, but to be fair to the other side, manipulation is a lot easier in this unregulated space, so there's a hint of truth to the whale business.  Mostly though, it's just trying to make sense of the psychology of the masses, which can be a fool's errand.

Logarithmic regression curves have us currently between $4.9K at the downside and $43K on the upside (the trendlines of the historical peaks and troughs of the last 10 years). Upside looks to have more potential currently, but loading up on some $5K bitcoin would also be pretty sweet.

I think there will be diminishing returns on the stock/flow value proposition.  It's been pretty accurate so far, but the difference in value of going from 5% annual issuance to 2% is much more significant than when going from 1% to 0.5%.  This is just based off my gut, but there are other concerns in a monetary system apart from issuance schedule and I think those will start to gain a greater impact than S/F in the next 5 years.

Just to add to the explanation: A subdivision of less than 1 Satoshi on chain would require a hardfork.  I imagine if it becomes an issue, most nodes would support such a proposal and such a change could be accomplished without much contention.  Bitcoin has a fairly long history now of proposing and rolling out changes to the protocol when required.

DCA = dollar cost averaging.  It's a technique where, instead of buying $100 all at once, you spread it out over time, say $20/month.  It tends to minimize the effects of any wild swings while you're accumulating.  
If you don't have a lot to invest, be mindful of fees, and once you've got a reasonable amount, transfer it off the exchange (they can get hacked/go defunct).  I would look into a hardware or paper wallet - just do your research first and stay safe.

I believe Pomp's prediction is relatively likely while McAfee's is only playing out with a major paradigm shift or chaos in the world economy.  Not that it couldn't happen, but I think it's quite unlikely in the next 1.4 years.
As a side note, a price of $1M/₿ would put bitcoin well past gold's market cap, implying that the broader role would be transitioning from long term hedge in hard money to a replacement of global reserve currency.  For the sake of overall human wellbeing, I'd rather we have a slower transition to global world reserve currency and medium of exchange.  A lot of chaos could ensue in the transition.
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:13:52


True, but so gold is completely concentrated in the hands of central banks and the level of price manipulation is incredible.  The price is set by paper trading anyhow and auditing is next to impossible.  Bitcoin is an entirely different beast where anyone can easily self-custody and the distribution is not among central banks, but among users. Auditing is trivial because the blockchain is open and public by default.  Also, try transporting a reasonable value of gold around the world, trustlessly, in 10 minutes - the value proposition is not the same at all.
I think bitcoin going from $0 to $200B in market capitalization was the incredible event.  Gaining another 100X doesn't seem impossible to me.  Sure, it may take a decade or two, but society has a history of forming a consensus around the hardest, most liquid money available, and I doubt the US dollar will hold that title all that much longer.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:31:55
I generally agree with this line of reasoning.  I still see it as a vast improvement to the status quo.  Banks will have to be more risk adverse if they want to survive.  They won't receive privileged borrowing rates from central banks on the backs of everyone else.  Hard money means there won't be the same deluge of money chasing returns on stocks, contributing to malinvestment and systematic economic risk. Wars can't be waged by printing more money. International trade and cooperation will be much easier under a unified borderless currency. Just a few of the perks, even if we still have banking.

I set a limit order several days earlier and just got extremely lucky.  I follow [this chart]( and I consider it a pretty safe buy anywhere at or under the second band.  $7700 happened to just be that band's price one month out from when I set the order.  Not sure about a sell strategy, but past performance indicates we could reach band 6 or 7 in a fomo moment.  I'll have some limit orders set for that as well.  Only problem is the targets constantly change, so I'm resetting limit orders every month.  Glad you didn't get caught in a short.

Cutting interest rates (and here, going negative with interest rates) means you're giving cheaper loans (or in this case, free money) to banks.  They take this extra liquidity, immediately turn around and issue new loans with it, meaning there are more M2 dollars in the economy chasing the same number of goods.  It's the definition of inflation.

Satoshi seemed to be self motivated, patient and exceedingly rational from what I can tell.  I can't see the OG panicking over slow uptake.

Wow, bitcoin intersects with so many different fields, you've got a lot to choose from.  I might take one of the following tacks (depending on your interests):
1. Monetary policy - Keynesian vs Austrian economics.
2. Social organization - the grassroots decentralization model vs hierarchical, top-down model.  Development, consensus, etc.
3. The humanitarian/political take - how it can give options to people in oppressive governments and/or challenge the status-quo in the others.
4. Technology adoption - bootstrapped network, technology adoption lifecycle and early adopter/ late adopter chasm.
I think any of those would provide some interesting material to report on.  If you are looking for any reference material, you might check out Saifedean Ammous' *the Bitcoin Standard* in reference to 1, *the spider and the starfish* for 2, and any of Andreas Antoponpoulos' material (i.e., *the Internet of Money)* for 3 or 4.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:04:28
Seems plausible.  I would add that moderate-risk investments can typically return 3-4% (after inflation) per year, so you might factor that in as well.  That interest on $1.5M would provide $50K per year already.

In an era of online, international commerce bitcoin makes more sense. There's no need to assay it for a transfer to establish trust, and no third party required. It also is soon to be more scarce than gold in terms of new supply.
It's difficult to determine just how much of a game changer this will be, so it increases in value in leaps and spurts. I think the value of all money is a collective delusion, and Bitcoin is no different. Over time, we're norming on higher and higher values for it though. Even with the last bull market, there's still demand for uncensorable money, for hard money, for free market money.
The problem Bitcoin solved was immense, and it remains significantly undervalued for the scope of problems it can solve in turn.  It was an incredibly rare investment opportunity. We'll never again go from not having a decentralized currency that solves Byzantine consensus to having one that does. In that respect, I believe it's currently the best intermediate to long term investment, and will likely continue to be for perhaps the next decade.
Gold on the other hand has a massive supply that cannot be artificially inflated. Perhaps it makes more sense in a world where we're not globally, digitally connected. That's about the most I can say for it.

The S&amp;P500 returned +23% in 2009.  Meanwhile, I don't think bitcoin even had a market or an exchange in place in 2009.  I don't think that's much to draw from.

Well, we already have &gt;1MB blocks due to segwit.  Also, LN is great but it still has on-chain transactions to open and close channels, which means we'll run into a transaction bottleneck again at some point (assuming greater adoption).  Further scaling solutions will have to be pursued, but I think we'll get there by continuing to develop creative solutions, not by centralizing and brute forcing it.

I'm not sure reason has as much to do with it as general sentiment and market cycles.  I'm preparing for possibly another 12 months before we see a steady upward trend again.    
  
On the positive side, the continuation of market cycle trends may be a boon to McAfee.  He may be a bit too optimistic, but it appears to be shaping up for another good bull run before the end of 2020.  I'm going to take my time and keep accumulating.
@_date: 2019-10-22 16:47:29
Ah, I understand the question now.  I'm guessing we're several decades away.  Maybe not - bitcoin does solve a lot of problems with banks of the world and international trade.  I would guess in the 2050's.  Maybe we see a dramatic shift where the whole world switches over to bitcoin as a unit of account before then, in which case all bets are off.  If that's the case, we'll probably see loci of control start to centralize before then, and we might need to create or migrate to another uncensorable money of the people by that time.

Honestly, I would be willing to sacrifice bitcoin if that meant we could halt environmental damage to our planet.  It really is important to me.  As is, there are so many more significant factors in environmental damage, and I think we can really benefit as a species from this decentralized economic experiment at this moment.  Our rampant consumerism partly (mostly?) as a result of monetary policy is already doing vastly more harm to our environment than all bitcoin mining thus far and at least through the next decade.
For instance, if we could cut frivolous air travel and new vehicle spending by even 5%; if we had an easy way to save long term, without simultaneously encouraging more frivolous spending and short term thinking from megalomaniac c-suite types; if we could encourage shifts to long-term sustainable power generation, we would be so much better off in aggregate.  Our governments have clearly demonstrated they'd rather promote short term thinking and keep everyone spending as much as possible at all costs.  It's therefore incumbent on us to to make the change in thinking, and bitcoin is our best bet for that right now.

My take is that the laws weren't written for crypto, but as they don't have unilateral control of your money, they are not custodians, and also don't have the full fiduciary responsibility or KYC requirements as defined by the existing legal framework.

Stocks are great, but current valuation of S&amp;P500 gives a P/E of 21.9.  That's overvalued no matter how you look at it.  I'd love to own some more stocks, but the only reason investors are holding at these prices is due to incoming liquidity and not for fundamental valuation.  Let's be real.

Well said.  Personally, I'd rather keep the base layer secure and use sidechains for big blocks if that's what you're after.  Once we sacrifice security and decentralization at the base layer, we can't get it back.
@_date: 2019-06-13 13:34:38
I'm a big lightning fan and I appreciate your points, but isn't the idea to spread bitcoin adoption?  The base chain is still UTXO bound - will only the privileged get to use it? I think it makes sense to experiment with some sidechains that can scale several orders of magnitude and potentially enhance privacy as well.  Yes, there will certainly be a security tradeoff, but let's explore what that looks like in more depth before dismissing the concept.  People are lazy.  The alternative to decentralized layer 2 is that people give up and download a custodial wallet.

LN = lightning network, a faster, cheaper off-chain way to spend bitcoin (generally intended for smaller transactions).
HD = Hierarchical deterministic, which refers to the practice of one wallet seed being able to generate many wallet addresses when you're receiving funds.  This lends a little privacy to the user.
Segwit refers to the most current address type, which also is the cheapest to transact with.
I'm pretty sure bluewallet's lightning solution is custodial if that's important to you - probably limit the funds you put in it.

I like Bitcoin and the environment, so I should be an easy sell on this, however PoS seems like quite a risky consensus mechanism for a protocol handling so much wealth.  It's my understanding that PoS has the following drawbacks:
1) "Nothing at stake" problem allows significant reorg events, reduced chain security.
2) Increased incentive for collusion among major staking participants.
3) Poorer distribution of coins due to lack of mining leads to more centralization. (And more justification in claiming the protocol is a pyramid scheme.)
If PoS can overcome these, I'm onboard, but until then, I see the energy requirement as a necessary evil.    Also, I think the block reward subsidy dropping to zero will be okay.  The worst case I see is recipients require a few more blocks for confirmation.
As an aside, PoW was created to fix the problems with PoS.  What has changed that we should decide to go back?

I think Bitcoin is, to an extent, also advancing sustainable energy.  Obviously, any energy will do, but it has created a lot of value for underutilized and/or remotely located renewable energy production.  I wonder how much increase in value these projects have seen, and to what extend that will promote future projects which otherwise may have been economically nonviable.

There are better explanations, but the simple answer is that each LN node needs at least one channel (preferably 3+) open with another node.  That channel is created with an on-chain, 2 of 2 signature transaction.  This means both you and the other party have to sign in order to move funds from that transaction's UTXO.  So long as you both want to be on the LN, and both your nodes are active and have a balance, there's no need to close the channel though.
While you're operating, each time you or the other node move funds through your channel, you sign a transaction reflecting the updated balance between you and the other node. This might happen hundreds or thousands of times while the channel is active.  This signed transaction is only ever broadcast (to be recorded on chain) when one of you is ready to close the channel.
In short, you need at least one on chain transaction to get started, and another when you want to close out your channel or node.  In the mean time, there are no restrictions or power requirements to make as many LN transactions as you wish.

Users are paying \~$10.42/second (130Ksat/s) to fill the blockchain right now, so this approach takes deep pockets to maintain.
@_date: 2019-02-27 15:17:17
There only exist a couple sidechains currently (that I know of).  There's blockstream's [liquid]( and [drivechain](  These operate (as far as I'm aware), by periodically locking up funds on the mainchain to "deposit" them on the sidechain.  Then on the sidechain, those funds can be transferred back and forth ad nauseum between users of the sidechain.  This effectively increases transaction throughput dramatically while also sacrificing security by not being recorded directly to the main chain.  Like the deposit, there's a mechanism whereby users can "withdraw" funds from the sidechain by unlocking them on the Bitcoin main-chain.  The mechanism for this is somewhat slow and will probably mostly be done by large players/liquidity makers on a periodic basis.
Lightning is totally different - it's a peer-to-peer communication and transaction protocol which transfers bitcoin between nodes (users) by merely signing transactions and updating channel balances *without* recording to the blockchain.  It routes similarly to the internet in a peer-to-peer manner where a payment might take many hops to reach its destination.  Eventually, these channels get broadcast to the blockchain when the user wants to close out the channel.
They're both incredible technologies, but the really interesting thing is that lightning can be applied to either.  Lightning is a protocol which really just requires some basic primitives like hashed timelocked contracts (HTLC) with 2 of 2 multisig.  Because of this, many blockchains or sidechains can theoretically implement it.  It's already running on Litecoin, and there are even nodes that can bridge the two so that, say, you can send Litecoin to pay a Bitcoin invoice.  (Mind blown!)  Likewise, I imagine if adoption picks up, we'll see LN start to be used on sidechains. That can offload some of the on-chain transaction volume from the main chain - for better or worse.

If bitcoin is still being used in ten years, it will likely be priced in the ballpark of $250K, maybe more.  There's just so much value to having a non-censorable, independent, fixed-supply, liquid, digitally transferable money.  If it's not, the most likely reason is that everyone's shifted to an alternative protocol that offers significantly improved data efficiency.  The genie's out of the bottle, and the only way to displace him is to release an even more powerful genie.

I would take it a step further and argue there's no such thing as a 51% "attack" in bitcoin.  There's only a matter of your personal definition of safe confirmation time, and whether that evaluation really makes sense.
Hint: if you're worried about a block being orphaned, try increasing confirmation time.  That's probably going to be easier than changing consensus.

I couldn't agree with you more on market interest rates.  Privileged borrowing rates set by decree and insurance against failure has gotten us into the financial situation we have now.  All incentives are aligned to exacerbate a boom-bust cycle in our economy.
Anyway, I think banks could still have a place.  It will be different, but having people specialize in global economic analysis, carefully gauge risk, and set lending rates accordingly will still be profitable.  Not to mention, when issuing loans, there's a non-trivial amount of work in drafting a contract, analyzing collateral, etc. that a specialist could still do more efficiently than the average person.  Also, not to mention the value reputation will have in such a system.
Then again, maybe with DAOs and/or consensus of the crowd, such a thing can become decentralized like you suggest.  That would be an impressive feat.  I think we should decentralize where we can, but we also have to realize there are often efficiencies to be gained from centralization (and of course fragility too.)

I'm all for paying taxes, but reporting seems burdensome at best.  Are you supposed to provide public addresses to all of your wallets to prove you still hold coin?  How do they know you have the key to that wallet?  What happens if you lose the key to a wallet?  Lots of questions.  Again, I recognize the need for taxes and will pay them willingly, but the longer they wait to release definitive tax guidance the more of a nightmare this is going to be.

I thought the bit about payment verification on Grin was interesting (and the problem bisq was having with fraud).  Ideally you would have perfect fungibility while also still being able to prove a transaction took place (when given a key for instance).
I've always thought it would be nice to see a nonprofit adopt bitcoin for open and easily audited accounting for instance.  At the same time, mass surveillance isn't likely to lead to desirable outcomes.
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:19:48
Yes, there are other consensus algorithms, but none that are open for all to participate, decentralized, and censorship resistant.  Even if you get a couple of those aspects, you still end up at best with PoS or DPoS and then you have both a rich-get-richer ponzi scheme while also coupled with a nothing-at-stake problem which is a vector for replay and double-spend attacks.
I'm glad we have blockchains experimenting with other consensus mechanisms, and maybe some day we can achieve a secure, decentralized financial setttlement layer which consumes less energy, but we can't just wish away the problems that PoW was created to fix.  Remember - proof-of-work was conceived to address the problems of proof-of-stake, and there's a reason that Bitcoin uses it.

@_date: 2019-02-07 15:00:57
I wouldn't look at it this way. There's no correlation with hash power to transaction throughput on the base chain.  A single miner (a 5W raspberry pi for example) is all that's needed for the network to run.  Any additional mining acts to secure the network and come to consensus, but how much computing power is contributed to that has no impact on the number of transactions which can take place.
We really want lots of hashpower to keep the network in consensus, otherwise anyone can double spend or do a deep block reorg and then there would be no point to using bitcoin.  Now I can understand, given environmental concerns, debating the sources of our electricity, but that's a different discussion. 
If you want to think about the logistics of lighting network, think about how you interact with the internet.  Do you run one fiber optic cable to wikipedia, since you use them sometimes, and another cable to reddit?  No, you just need a minimum of one connection - to your ISP - and because it's connected to many other nodes, it can route your traffic wherever it needs to go.  Same with LN, and in relation to power, it's all off-chain, so it's only how much power your cell phone, casa node, or computer is consuming.
Hope that helps.

These  are good questions and I can't answer them all in depth, so I'm going to try to keep it simple:
1) There originally was no block size, but spamming the mempool required the implementation of one.
2) Couldn't handle 2B people on-chain.  Sidechains and layer 2 can help.  Also, there are already plenty of custodial services (but that's defeating the point).  LN routing is extremely cheap, but opening/closing channels is expensive.
3)  A lot.  Probably 2-3 per month per person.  7 per second isn't a hard limit.  Native segwit signatures, Schnorr signatures, taproot, transaction batching can all increase the number of on-chain transactions significantly in the future.
4) If it really takes off, none of us will be able to afford on-chain base layer transactions on a regular basis (i.e., maybe for buying a house, etc.).  We'll all be using layer 2 - probably on top of sidechains if it really gains wide adoption.  Block size should be scarce if decentralization is important.
5)Yes, LN is more decentralized by a landslide.  Attacking it would be like attacking the internet - it may slow traffic for some, but you still just route around any outages.  No, you I don't think you could instantly convince 10K node operators to agree to a consensus change and increase the block size limit - it's there for a good reason.
Also, in general, don't think of solutions to scaling problems in linear terms (like block size increase).  That will never work in the long run - instead we need creative solutions like lightning, which expand traffic exponentially as that's the only mode that will successfully reach a significant scale.

I'm impressed.  I basically just balance my bank account in my spreadsheet (this is a different one) and compare changes in monthly expenditures, but I miss all the cash and credit transactions.
I don't know if you have a similar reporting body in your locality, but I might suggest something like the [consumer price index]( which broadly tracks the prices of goods.  Of course, this has the potential to be politicized, so it may not be as good as doing your own tracking, but it tends to have a decent level of detail if you want to get into the numbers.
As far as vehicles, my family has two, and I'm proud to report they account for only 1.5% of our net worth.  Mine's also boring but reliable.  It's getting long in the tooth, yet I haven't felt compelled to upgrade as it still gets great mileage and has no mechanical issues.

I can't agree with this more.  Let's have some choice in scaling tradeoffs for cheaper fees and keep the base chain rock solid.  Layer 2 (not talking just LN here) can bring us orders of magnitude more transaction throughput and crucially, UTXOs to serve a growing user base.

It’s easy to get caught up in price and get discouraged. If you’re feeling this way, consider a few points:
Is bitcoin working as intended? Here are the current stats.
* 557s average block time. 
* 1Sat/byte transactions are being confirmed
* \&gt;50% segwit usage
* Hashrate: 100Eh/s
Do we still have developer interest? Very much so.
* Lightning network – 34K (public) channels, 859BTC (public) capacity.
* Taproot
* Miniscript
* Schnorr
* Statechains
How’s the rest of the ecosystem? We now have decentralized and trust-minimized exchange options. Coinjoin pools are increasing privacy and disrupting the ability of chainalysis. Liquid’s sidechain is set to privately and efficiently eat the lunch of most of the altcoin market. We have several great teams developing and selling full node systems to help out the less technically inclined among us.
How is bitcoin doing politically? We have real support among sitting legislators in the US. QE infinity illustrates a real need for hard money, and the rest of the world has generally even worse problems (look at any of S. America). The outlook for the need for an international, unmanipulable store of value is only forecast to grow from my perspective.
The fundamentals look incredibly bullish, so that finally brings us to price. On this last point, it can be difficult to stay impartial, which is why I do my own analysis (see chart above) to forecast the potential gains and losses based on historical price and volatility. Here’s why I think now is a great entry point, and should not be overlooked for some negative sentiment. I have been preparing for a move lower, as historically, it happens before a major bull market. These trend lines represent the mean (white), peak (green) and low (red) for all the historical data I have. They are logarithmic regressions (similar to moonmath), and have held true for the past decade.
An entry into the market now would find historical long-term support from this regression analysis by March 22, 2020. That’s only three months until a purchase is likely to remain forever in the black. This to me seems like an incredible opportunity.
Are there potential risks? Sure – we’re likely to enter a global recession for the first time in bitcoin’s history and no one knows how the market will react. Perhaps a significantly better protocol could be dropped by a pseudonymous benefactor in an IRC chat, and eventually totally supplant bitcoin.  (Please do this if you have any incredible ideas) I don’t view either of these as reasons to panic, and I certainly don’t see the current price slump as reason to either. Don’t let your emotions get the better of you if you have any belief in the bitcoin experiment, and (if you can afford it) don’t miss this incredible opportunity we have right now. Best of luck; I'll see you in 2021.

You've missed the point.  Bitcoin is amoral, apolitical.  The existing financial system and monetary supply scheme pays for political influence to favor their businesses/sector over others while the bitcoin network runs on math and game theory and can't be influenced by bribes.  See segwit2X, binance chain reorg for more info on this last point.
@_date: 2019-12-12 14:09:46
has a pretty cool statechain concept.  Minimizes the trust required and lets you withdraw from a sidechain in an antagonistic environment.  The downside is that you have to deal in whole UTXOs.  Also, it requires a couple upgrades - Schnorr sigs and sighash anyprevinput I believe.  Still pretty impressive how much trustlessness and privacy it offers.

Imagine the broader connections - the network will be more like a web than a chain.  When the coffee shop needs to buy more napkins or pay its workers, it might find an efficient route through your payment channel to the napkin distributor.  So long as you receive bitcoin as well as paying it out, it can come back to you through your various LN channels and balance the channels back out.  Also, we don't have to worry about centralization much, because it's a trustless system.  Even if there are major hubs, they won't be able to hose you over due to game theory providing a deterrent.

I'm sure there would be at least a little state interest if there was enough market liquidity to support huge trades.  Oil tankers carry a lot of oil though, and right now the combined lack of liquidity coupled with volatility is too much.
That, and as others have pointed out, we're generally dealing with authoritarian regimes who's interests are antithetical to open, borderless, censorship resistant money.
Perhaps in the not-too-distant future we'll get there.  It seems like the perfect application for the technology - secure, high value, global trades without the settlement fuss.

As far as I'm aware, there's no good way to measure LN activity - it's fairly private in nature by default.  Privacy is a good thing, but it also means we might not be able to collect a whole lot in the way of network usage statistics unless it's volunteered by node operators, aggregated and extrapolated.  Even then, it will be a fuzzy picture at best.
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:28:54
If it breaks, it breaks.  It will mean we're deviating from a long-term trend.  I'm very interested to see how the next global recession influences bitcoin's value.  In my mind, this would be the most likely reason for a short-term deviation from the trend, and it's something we haven't experienced yet in bitcoin's history.  Also, inter-day prices are not captured in my data, so there's that.  Again, this is just one tool I use to try and stay impartial, and I think a dip to the red line is entirely probable based on history.

Good points, but I think we could really use eltoo channels before it's ready for mainstream.  Right now you can't make a backup of your node/channel states without risking losing the entire value of your channel should it become outdated.  Before eltoo can happen we need the sighash\_noinput opcode to be adopted/soft forked into the bitcoin protocol.

I see this as good for the consumer.  The consumer always paid this fee - it was just baked into the cost of every good or service.  Now it's transparent and there's a way to opt out.  Also, those who don't want to pay for the credit card's 3% don't have to subsidize everyone else who doesn't mind.  If you like the service the credit card provides just continue transactions as normal.

Happy to help.  Obviously, it's possible the trend could totally break, but I think this is just what it looks like when you introduce a more competitive species into the monetary ecosystem.  A store of value takes time to build and gain trust and it's not going to happen overnight or in a smooth manner.  I see this long term trend as more of a constant force that the price will have to fight against.  It doesn't guarantee anything, but at the same time, I don't intend to buy above band 5 without expecting the price to soon revert to the mean.  Also, if we're near the bottom band, I think I'm likelier to be happier with my investment in the near-term.

Excellent points. I appreciate the information on statechains - I hadn't heard of them before.  Kind of like a trust-minimized method of running a sidechain utilizing eltoo.
Does anyone else have the notion that eventually we'll all be transacting on sidechains or (dare I say it) permissioned custodial networks, which are all largely interoperable?  I have a suspicion that we'll essentially replace today's banks with sidechains and custodial networks.  They will be the only ones that can afford to regularly transact on the base chain and we'll effectively replace swift and inter-bank transfers with bitcoin's base chain.  At least we'll have a permissionless and transparent base layer I suppose.  On a positive note, whatever we come up with for sidechains, we'll have to hose it up pretty good to do worse than the world's legacy monetary system.

Lol, he's a smart guy, but I don't think this will age well. When was the last time you bought something with gold? I think we'll see Bitcoin stabilize enough in the next 10-20 years that goods and services will start to be priced in it. Sure, that's not overnight, but it's a fundamentally better system and seems inevitable to me, especially as more of the non-priveleged class around the world is cut off from USD and banking services.
The first major currency crisis or recession in that timeframe could easily see millions of people spinning up 2nd layer Bitcoin wallets. They'll probably flock to custodial options and we'll all gag, but it will be easy to onboard them, and it will still be more palatable than their alternatives.
Also, he thinks facebucks will be a better currency than Bitcoin, and that's the only way forward? I don't think he's thought this through enough. Or maybe he just doesn't get the power of decentralization.

Silas,  you made some really good points, but I don't agree with this one.  Certainly bitcoin has been volatile in price in it's first decade, but we're clearly seeing a trend of decreasing volatility and already it's starting to look more stable than the worst of the fiat currencies (Venezuela, Zimbabwe).  In the next decade I imagine we see it become a more stable and secure store of value than several more of them (Argentina, Iran, Sudan, etc.).  The trend is in one direction only.

I think LN is great from a payment perspective - instant settlement, privacy, etc. The problem is onboarding a massive number of people would still drive transaction prices up on the base chain. I think statechains might be coupled with LN to handle this in a way that doesn't sacrifice an enormous amount of trust.
If Bitcoin continues to grow, it will have to onboard more users in a way that doesn't bottleneck at the base chain. The path of least resistance for the average person is a custodial solution - hopefully we can get creative to do better than that.

Thanks for the thoughtful reply.  I would love to be proven wrong about base layer scaling actually.  My point was that linear scaling is a way to price everyone out of the market for running a full node.  If the users aren't also running a node, they have no say in consensus, and then we may as well just cede all control to the miners, which doesn't strike me as a good idea.
If we can achieve quadratic scaling at the base layer, I'm all for it, and there are certainly some efforts we can take to improve efficiency - we should definitely pick the low-hanging fruit where possible, but I think that will only get us so far, and not to 7B people.
On the sidechain front, the analogy to banks was just a rough analogy.  I have confidence we can do it in such a way that it doesn't require trust in a third party - we have byzantine fault tolerant consensus now.  We can probably also leverage security of the base chain to do this.  Surely we can improve upon liquid's architecture before sidechains are really needed.
Another comparison is with mining - not many people mine by themselves any more, they form pools, which makes the economics more efficient.  Some of these pools give the miners voting rights, and if members don't like a pool's policies they're free to switch to another.  The migration to mining pools didn't break bitcoin and I don't think sidechains will either.
Back to the bank analogy, imagine the only way people could bank was to interact directly with the swift network - our banking system would grind to a halt and it would cost a fortune to move any money.  Layered solutions solve an awful lot of problems, we just need to approach it in a thoughtful manner that doesn't break with bitcoins core principles.  I think we can get there.

Thanks for the talk; I'll check it out later today.  I hope you do spread the word.  I think sidechains are going to be important - we're just not going to be able to "bank the unbanked" directly on chain with limited block space.  At the same time, I realize limiting block space is crucially important for decentralization.  I'm optimistic that we can develop approaches to sidechains that will limit the tradeoffs we have to make, and this could be one piece of that puzzle.  The alternative for the unbanked is going to look a lot like facebook coin and I'm certain we can do better than that.

Nothing jumps out at me that an average user would notice.  Looks like a lot of stability enhancements (making sure it doesn't crash during edge-cases) and RPC additions/updates.  Remote procedure calls are a way for wallets/users/programs to interact directly with the software, and it looks like they've added some capability.  Those will work their way into other software (wallets, LN, etc.) in the future.  There are also several security improvements - improved random number generation, P2P protocol. I can't tell what all the work is that's going on with wallets, but there a fair amount there too.

Not quite the same.  I agree with you on Brexit/Trump, but look into the history of Keynesian economics and current economic principles.  There is essentially no grounding in fact - it was a power grab used to finance war efforts.  Those in power were willing to ignore hundreds of years of solid economic study when it was convenient.  Keynes wasn't a brilliant academic - quite the opposite, just a popular playboy whose crazy idea was politically expedient at the time while politicians were backed into a corner.
This is about removing ego and politics from economics.  No single man should have the power to send the world into recession or recovery.  Nor, in my opinion, should entire countries starve to death because another country wants their leader overthrown.

Wind, geothermal, and hydro are generally great sources for mining because the power they produce tends to be cheap, but they're often located far from population centers and the cost of transmission lines makes them not cost effective for consumer use.  And yes, they're generally fairly consistent in their energy output as well.

I'm not an expert, but I think your options are: a pruned node - a full node that just discards old blocks above a limit, or an SPV client that essentially trusts the full nodes to which it's connected.  I believe there are a couple efforts under development to create nodes which bridge the gap between these two - more anonymity and less trust, but also less taxing in hardware and bandwidth.  I think they're still a ways off though.
In the case of an SPV client, you can accomplish goals (a) and (b), but you're trusting the nodes to which you're connected to have validated the blocks and be on a valid chain.  You're also giving away some privacy if that's important to you (still better than a third-party by a long shot).

You specify your cost basis when reporting.  So, just list the date you bought that coin and the price you paid for it (including fees if you want).  FIFO is the standard method of accounting here, and is generally preferable for a long term capital gains rate, but I don't think it's mandatory.  It is important, however, to stay consistent in your methodology.  Again, I'd recommend FIFO without a compelling reason to deviate from the norm.

Your numbers are reasonable - from there I would present the following:
We won't scale to worldwide adoption on the base layer alone, even when using lightning for the majority of transactions.  Block size increases even remotely approaching that possibility would entirely kill the decentralized consensus and the whole point of bitcoin along with it.  Any model where the average user makes regular transactions on the base chain is simply untenable at a global scale.
The only rational solution I currently see is a great number of sidechains.  From there you can potentially run a routing node (LN) and hop to the main chain or other sidechains as needed.  I imagine these sidechains like community owned banks.  They can settle a few times a day with other banks (sidechains, drivechains, custody solutions, or whatever) in a small number of large value transactions.  Users of the chains will probably be the ones to do this, incentivized by arbitrage opportunities (liquid-BTC trading slightly higher than drivechain-BTC for example).
We can still have global instant payments denominated in BTC, but regular base-layer transactions for individuals will be out.

I wouldn't stop there though. The \~80% of bitcoin's hashrate that is produced with renewable energy is doing a tremendous service to the industry.  If you're interested in transitioning the world to carbon-neutral energy production, then making renewable energy infrastructure more profitable and increasing the economic incentive for new infrastructure *right now* is of utmost importance.  Not only are most of these rage-click articles ignorant of the energy consumed by actual bitcoin mining operations, but they completely ignore the benefits.

A podunk nation, most likely ostracized in some way, will be the first to dip their toe in the water.

This is disingenuous.  The best data I've seen on miners' energy usage (not super easy to obtain) indicated that mining was overwhelmingly powered by renewable energy sources.  BBC doesn't cite any facts here, so it's difficult to dispute, but we do know a large portion of Chinese mining utilizes hydroelectric power.  There are also plenty of documented projects using remotely located wind/geothermal/hydro sources which didn't have enough base demand to be fully utilized previously.  The effect is to establish a price floor for energy generation - a huge boon to renewable energy projects when investors are trying to calculate potential profitability of a new installation and whether or not to build it. 
So sure, bitcoin has likely increased demand for fossil fuels, but it's also increased demand much more for renewables - even ones that couldn't be used before do to remoteness from population centers.  On the whole, I'd say it's a very good thing to kickstart renewable energy efforts right now.  The industry needs capital inflow to drive R&amp;D, manufacturing improvements, and economies of scale.  Let's worry about using the right energy, not creating an energy gestapo to decide if your consumption is legitimate or not.

Greenie here.  Look, entirely disregarding climate science or just being an ass about it isn't going to win you any points from me.  Most folks still don't give a shit about climate change anyway - look at how much it's discussed in politics - almost never.  AI and nukes no one cares about either, which are even hairier issues.  
  
There are several good counter arguments that could actually persuade someone, here are a few:  
  
1.  All industries use energy to make a profit - most are dirtier energy than Bitcoin.  We don't tend to rail on them.  
  
2.  Bitcoin's demand for energy is a huge boon for renewable energy - finally the world's hydro projects are actually getting used close to capacity - remote and aging wind farms have co-located customers now which reduces the need to maintain expensive long distance, high power transmission lines, etc.  This increases the base demand and profitability for these projects.  Most renewable energy projects are massive, long-term affairs.  New installations will have increased profitability and viability going forward.  
  
3.  The economics of Bitcoin as a sound money encourage saving when possible.  Fiat discourages it by constantly and unpredictably inflating it.  The only reason for McMansions and overheated stock prices are that they suck less than other savings vehicles - Bitcoin can change that.  Now we can actually save money without having to blow it on shit we don't need, or CEOs or bankers that are going to extort or scam us.  This is great from a greenie perspective because its more efficient and less wasteful.  
  
4.  The benefits of frictionless sound money to enable world trade give power back to regular people.  It's more and more going to expose  the ridiculous asshole governments of places like Venezuela as absurd and backwards.  Actually all trade friction and monetary controls are going to start appearing in the same light.  This is a boon for humanity and the temporary energy cost (still benefiting renewables) is worth the cost in my opinion.  
  
Just one more thought - I'm looking forward to seeing how alternative consensus algorithms work out.  I'm not ideologically opposed to PoS, but I haven't seen an implementation yet that I would trust my savings to.  I like that PoW is game theoretic and mathematically provably secure.  Right now, it's the best we've got.

Every peer (full node) can verify that each block propagated through the network conforms to the consensus rules as they understand them.  If miners choose to not follow your node's consensus rules, their block will be rejected by your node and their effort is wasted.  I would say, in that regard, nodes (collectively) have all the power.  That's not to say a chain split couldn't occur, but the nice thing about running your own node, is that you don't have to blindly follow consensus rules that you don't agree with.

Fire departments, roads, radio frequency spectrum management, national representation to foreign governments, civil dispute resolution, civil defense to name a few.  Just because we have a lot of waste, doesn't mean it all has to be thrown out.  
If anarcho-capitalism provides better outcomes on these issues, why do we fail to see prominent examples of prosperous societies lacking formal government.  I would argue that they tend to end like the Sri-Lanka seasteaders.
DAOs may be able to perform some pro-social government roles in the future, but we're not there yet.

I think the point of casa lightning node was in the user interface /apps and multi-factor authentication setup.  If they haven't addressed updates, they're missing their target audience.

I guess my point was that money is a human abstraction - an emergent property of trade.  It's not like the laws of physics that can be scientifically derived, but rather just a convention for trade at which we've cumulatively arrived.  
  
Given that we are going to transact in some form of currency, then bitcoin is well suited, and is a better basis for currency than many others which have come before it.  The free market price discovery is one benefit, but the others are: a lack of centralized minting or control, mathematically predictable inflation rate (scarcity), security, ease of global transaction (portability), and divisibility (micro-payments to millions).
@_date: 2018-11-14 12:20:06
The renminbi may last longer than most.  When you have a surveillance state and control your populace's internet access, it may be easier to enforce currency use.  That said, I'm not sure why a country would want to be last to the party.  Restricting personal liberty and sound savings vehicles isn't exactly a ticket to national prosperity.
@_date: 2018-11-14 12:02:27
Honestly, if Bitcoin eventually becomes the new world reserve currency, I'm sure we'll still have loans, debt, and banks.  The only difference would be a lack of central planning and inability to inflate the currency at will.  This would theoretically lead to a market-based interest rate that more accurately reflects risk tolerance and shorter, less impactful boom-bust cycles.  
  
There's a lot to worry about short of apocalypse scenarios.  Greece hasn't entered full anarchy or apocalypse, but I'm sure some of its citizens would prefer to still have a bit of their savings left.   A portfolio diversified with crypto could help in this regard.

Peter, I've really been enjoying your show - you've had some really high caliber guests on.  Keep it up.  
  
I just listened to  yesterday with Steve Keen, and while I appreciated his unique perspective, it absolutely drove me nuts that there was little push-back on his arguments against bitcoin in the last 10-15 minutes of the episode.  Partially, I think it was just his surface-level understanding of the protocol, but it would be great to hear some debate on the finer points, such as Keynesian vs Austrian economics, energy consumption dedicated to hard money, the value of hard money in today's world, etc.  I could just hear Saifedean in my head rebutting each of his objections.  
  
Have you considered hosting any debates on subjects like this?  I think a contrarian perspective is healthy, but I think it would be helpful to tease apart the arguments a little more.  Particularly where energy consumption is concerned, I think debate would be a healthy thing.  There are some good arguments on both sides that would be worthwhile to consider.

Fair point, although, theoretically you would be indirectly securing the bitcoin network by converting alts to BTC, boosting the price slightly, and making it more profitable for others to mine, ultimately resulting in more hash power for BTC.  Perhaps not quite the same as the real thing, but the end result should be roughly equivalent.

It doesn't even sound nuts to me anymore.  The people of this world just want a way to transact with each other and save a little of their hard work for another day.

No, there are still only 17M bitcoins.  There are also now 17M of an altcoin called BCHABC and theres another 17M of another alt called BCHSV, but neither of those are interchangable with or the same as bitcoin, which is clearly defined as the chain started in 2009 with the most cumulative proof-of-work securing it.

Did no one read it?  It's not even close to FUD!  The article doesn't even pass any judgement - just gives raw figures.  Those figures show that bitcoin is HARDER money than gold, as in it's harder to increase the supply.  This is an extremely good thing for bitcoin.  All the article says that could be even remotely confrontational is that the figures could "encourage debate on energy demands."

Both the correction and the backlash seem more subdued this time than in the past.  Meanwhile, people are actually using it (granted, perhaps a small minority as most are using it as a speculative instrument or hedge).  Yes, there are more people involved now, but when everything settles down maybe they too will finally see that the 5000 "bitcoin is dead" articles weren't in fact true after all.  
  
Let's be honest, most of us don't *need* bitcoin.  It's nice that it's censorship resistant, borderless, permissionless, and decentralized, but we have ways to save money and make payments already.  There are, however, people in this world who really do need it, and unfortunately, that subset of the world population who has ever needed a way out is only going to grow.  
  
For every first world citizen who risked too much in the bull run there's also one of [these]( [guys]( for whom btc might be their only viable store of value or means of transacting right now.

Yes, I can understand why, as a host, he didn't want to get into it - but it was frustrating to just leave those surface level objections as is, without getting down to the meat of the arguments.  I think there could have been some good discussion on those points had time and inclination permitted.

Is that true?  I thought a large part of wind farm expense was typically long transmission lines and associated infrastructure.  It seems like if you discounted that expense, and have a sunk cost in turbines, the price/KW would drop dramatically, especially if the turbines have no existing economic value otherwise.  
Okay, the numbers I can find (quick and dirty) are $20-$40/MWh for new wind farm installation and $15-$20/MWh for transmission lines (these are numbers from the US.  I assume there are cheaper sources of power elsewhere, but again, if you have existing, depreciated wind turbines otherwise sitting idle, why not?

The scary truth is that all money is just an arbitrary convention we humans use.  There's very little innate value to anything we use as currency outside of what value we ascribe to it.

The article explains it - nodes pass a new transaction along between a few nodes before it finally gets broadcast to everyone.  (Imagine it traveling along a stem of a dandelion before bursting forth into the fuzz a little distance away.)  
  
This will make it much harder to triangulate where a transaction originated, thus improving privacy for those who run a node.  Triangulation is a theoretical technique that used by someone with many nodes on the network.  By comparing when a transaction reached each node, and looking at network topology, it would be possible to roughly determine from which node a transaction might have originated.  
  
This is just one aspect of privacy that's needed on the network.  It won't do anything by itself for UTXO privacy/fungibility.

There are a bunch of other consensus and minting algorithms - they just haven't been proven or sufficiently tested.  Like Steven said, there are currently, and will be plenty of other ways to transact in Bitcoin - Lightning Network, sidechains, etc., which don't require base chain transactions.  As is, the profitability of bitcoin mining is scheduled to halve every 4ish years.  It's a problem that will take care of itself to some extent.

True, but that's in part because our economy is itself built on a pyramid scheme.  The stock market, social security (US retirement scheme), pensions are all based on more people coming in and more products produced next year than last year.  Our most solid retirement options are essentially stock market based, but dividends only produce 1.8% per year, which is below the rate of inflation.  If it weren't for more people constantly entering the system, the system would collapse.  
Anyway, all that to say most people just want to be able to save their work today and spend it tomorrow.  Sooner or later we will have to get to a steady-state where we're not making exponentially more people, exponentially more stuff, and mining exponentially more resources, just to maintain the status quo.  The economic system we use, should probably reflect that reality at some point.

Good advice.  I suppose if you have really deep pockets, and you got lucky on the timing of the market, the gamble could potentially pay off.  But, yeah, in the end you will have to compete with established players in this space who are probably spending in the thousands of BTC per year trying to eek out performance gains on top of their existing state-of-the-art.  It does sound like quite a task.  
Also, Lyra2 is a memory-hard algorithm, and hardware resistant too I think.  I'm not sure you wouldn't end up essentially recreating a GPU in the end - which seems even more daunting than trying to compete with Bitmain on SHA256.  Then again, this is totally out of my realm, so I could be wrong.

Great - I can relate to that sentiment and had very much the same view up until I read 'The Bitcoin Standard.'  I can safely say that it reversed my views on the subject by about 95%.  Saifedean Ammous covers a lot of historical examples and data that absolutely destroy the Keynesian economic theory.  
  
By the way, Keynes was essentially an arrogant privileged dude with no background in economics who sold a load of shit to governments.  They found it politically expedient at the time to receive free money to finance and repay war debt.  
  
Anyway, Ammous presents plenty of data to support the notion that sounds money encourages a longer term view, which makes the world more prosperous in general.  Keynesian inflation and economics only benefits the economy in the short term and can be very detrimental to the world economy over longer time-spans.  Not only that, but centralized planning and control of local interest rates creates enormous boom bust cycles, with very little feedback mechanism for self-correction unlike the system we had during sound (inflation limited) money.  
  
Seriously, find a copy of the book - it's quite enlightening.

I would second that, at least in the long run.  Fewer people left to adopt will mean exponential growth in value will slow down (a good thing I think).  I'm not sure how much that will play out in the next 5 years though.  
I'm hoping for some more infrastructure/architecture changes in this timeframe if we're to significantly increase the number of users.  Something like sidechains or pools which could each have thousands to millions of users could interact via lightning network and themselves only have to open/close channels perhaps once or twice a day on the main chain.  This sort of scaling could actually allow an exponential increase in the number of users the system could support and would be possible now that we have lightning.  If you view blockspace as a fixed resource it will be imperative to get as much value as possible from it, and even segwit+lightning only gets us so far.  If we're to achieve global adoption, individuals won't be routinely writing to the chain directly.  Now we just need to manage this in a trustless/non-censurable manner.

Also, like we see with AMD/Intel rivalry, competitiveness and advances in efficiency often come in somewhat unpredictable leaps.  Back the original question, if Bitmain is plowing 90% of that massive profit back into R&amp;D for their next generation chip, then I would say, no, another player could not compete with that research budget.  If it's instead spent on hookers and blow, then yes, probably a good chance for competition.

I'm assuming this wasn't a trolling attempt - this is what lightning network is specifically intended for. See [starblocks](  Beyond that, there are other options such as sidechains or altcoins (where you can trade security for convenience).  Your coffee example is analogous to going to the bank and paying for an automated clearing house transfer ($30 at my bank), showing ID, filling out and signing a couple documents, then waiting three days for it to clear.  Sure, you could pay for your coffee like that if you want, but there are much better options readily available.  
I'm not saying the bitcoin protocol is perfect, in fact it's still pretty nascent in my opinion - however, it serves a very important function at the base layer on which we can build out additional infrastructure to improve throughput and user experience.

I would think the benefits of dollar cost averaging (avoiding volatility by investing continuously over a span of time) would outweigh the risk of missing out on gains.  As in - if I had $30K to invest today, I would probably invest it over a 12 month period anyway.

You can actually enter the space somewhat cheaply by starting with FPGAs and then migrating over to a shared mask fab service like [MOSIS](  That might set you back somewhere in the neighborhood of $20K.  The problem is that ASICs for mining rely on efficiency gains that are on the bleeding edge in order to be competitive.  That's going to require unique foundry capabilities and a lot of iterative design to get a working product.  I imagine it would take access to said foundries plus potentially hundreds of BTC worth of R&amp;D investment, leasing of specialized intellectual property, etc.  Even then the end result might not be quite competitive with the state-of-the-art.
I haven't actually designed ASICs myself, just worked with those who did (not bleeding-edge tech either), so someone correct me if I'm wrong.

'The Dictator's Handbook' is a pretty insightful read.  Its premise is basically the same as the point you're making here.  If you just assume all leaders value clinging to power above all else, the choices made and situations created by autocrats all tend to look similar and predictable.  Democracy vs communism isn't as important as the inherent safeguards against corruption baked into a government.  I think democratic, capitalistic governments tend to allow less corruption on the whole, but in the end it's not the economic philosophy that creates devastation in a society, rather an authoritarian power struggle and those who acquiesce to it.

This is excellent; thank you for sharing.  I was just attempting my own regression analysis to try and come up with a few simple time based levels to accumulate more, or sell when it gets overheated.  I like your power regression better, but the trend is clearly the same - less volatility over time, and decreasing growth rate.
It makes a lot of sense when you consider human psychology and risk that we would see a pattern like this emerge.  Not that hyperbitcoinization couldn't happen, but in a world where bitcoin is gradually converting followers and competes in a market with other functioning currencies, this paradigm makes sense to me.

What are the accessibility and centralized development problems?  I'm curious, because I would have characterized both of those as strengths.  You can run a lightning node on an android phone (pretty accessible) or a raspberry pi, and I think the current count is 5 different wallets/nodes available from as many different organizations.  
I guess I see having to download and run a wallet as a pretty reasonable compromise to allow more throughput while maintaining the decentralization and security of the base chain (which has been demonstrated as a real problem for many other chains lately).

3)  The problem I would see with your method is that there's less privacy using a single address over and over than there is with a hierarchical deterministic wallet.  (A wallet in which a single seed can generate any number of unique addresses - the major hardware wallets do this.)  Perhaps in a few years time, it might also be more feasible to use state channels (LN) for something like this.  Right now there's not enough liquidity and transaction size limit is low, but if you could pay your bills with those funds, it might also make sense to get paid that way as well.

For all the power consumed, I think Bitcoin has done a lot to increase demand for alternative energy production.  This in turn, lowers the necessary profitability threshold for new installations, regardless of where they are located in the world, and spurs more investment in the sector.

Good point on organic growth, but still, making it easier to onboard new users I would consider a boon.  Just like with bitcoin itself: come for the speculation, stay for the philosophy.  If merchants have an easy way to accept it and try it out, that can lead to true converts in the future.  
  
I mean, people are lazy bastards, right?  If faced with this option or merchants flocking to an easier, centralized shitcoin, I'm choosing the former.  It's just like the internet - promised to remove gatekeepers, democratize knowledge.  It's done that to a reasonable extent, but people are still eager to flock to new gatekeepers when they make things shiny and easy enough to sign up.  Perhaps if merchants' interest was piqued (via an easy onboarding payment processor they already use), then just maybe that will spur them to read up on it and realize that gatekeepers are no longer necessary.

I am optimistic that the cryptocurrency market as a whole will achieve much greater energy efficiency in the future.  The proof of stake concept illustrates this quite nicely.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have the same Nash equilibrium (game theory) that incentivizes all Bitcoin nodes to cooperate and with so much money on the line is highly risky.  I think, for the time being, that the power usage in PoW is a necessary element for the largest and most secure cryptocurrency, and that the advances and benefits it brings to society, are worth the expense.  This is something that we'll likely have to look at more critically in time.  Perhaps as more mathematicians get involved, we can advance to more energy efficient ways to secure the blockchain (or other cryptocurrency networks) without having to risk the security of everyone's funds at the same time.

Yeah, the energy consumption argument is crazy.  It's like saying gold requires 36.6B USD in energy each year to operate just because that's how much was spent mining it during the last mining boom.  The base energy cost to operate the bitcoin network is really just 1 raspberry pi hashing blocks every 10 minutes.  Anything more than that is due to people wanting to profit by mining, which is understandable, but not at all correlated to the ability to transact with the protocol.

Another point is power consumption is totally unrelated to transaction throughput capacity.  Expressing Joules/transaction is a deceptive and inaccurate statistic.  Any mining power over 5W acts to increase security to the chain, but doesn't enable any additional transactions to be recorded.  Just to be clear - a mobile phone can process transactions all day long - the only reason additional power is consumed is because security of the chain is incentivized, and that's a good thing.

The codebase is probably some of the most intensely scrutinized out there but, should it happen, it would likely lead to a hardfork to a protocol or signature scheme without the flaw.


Seems more likely.  In this case, I imagine we will implement and transition to quantum-resistant signatures.  Could cause some temporary inflation as keys to old addresses are mined.  Again, a hardfork might be a more stable fix.

The most accurate estimate I've seen to date was something like 75%-85% hydro and other renewables.  I think the fasinating thing here though, is how it puts a baseline value on any energy generated - practically anywhere in the world.  This improves the profitability of all competitive renewable energy projects and potentially spurs the construction of new ones.  Having economic incentives in place *right now* to build additional renewable energy infrastructure is a big deal if you're focused on the environment, and this cost/benefit seems like a bargain.

Oh, well, there are things that can help the base chain.  I should have mentioned Schnorr signatures, which will reduce transactions sizes and make multisig transactions the same size as a normal transation.  Still, this only goes so far, increasing capacity by something like 40% if I recall (and allow us to fit even more 2-of-2 transactions).  We still need massive scaling though, and that's where I think sidechains coupled with lightning might provide a solution.

Yes, unfortunately we'll have to scale beyond just LN - we won't have enough capacity in the base chain for just opening and closing enough LN channels to support mass adoption.  I think sidechains might fill this role at some point.  There will likely be some tradeoffs in decentralization or security unfortunately.  The benefit is that you could have massively greater scale when you're using a number of sidechains which 'settle' in BTC.  Lightning can run on top of these, and lightning nodes could conceivably bridge between sidechains or from a sidechain to the bitcoin chain.  I'm not aware of other scaling efforts at the moment, although segwit and LN should get us quite a bit of mileage before it's a pressing issue.
If you're interested in sidechains, I think drivechain was the first implementation.  You can read about it here:  [

I agree with you.  Also I think the implication of "don't invest too much" is probably wrong.  I think stocks (globally), and real estate are very risky right now, and the dollar is also somewhat risky with unchecked deficit spending and rising inflation.

Oh, and by the way, I'm also generally progressive minded, with some libertarian leanings as well.  I think we ought to let people generally do as they please, so long as it's not at the expense of others.  I feel like politics in the US have been co-opted though, and neither party tends to stand for much of anything that's important to me.  They also wind-vane with remarkable speed, leading me to believe the leadership of both parties really cares more about obtaining or retaining power than anything substantive.  "The Dictator's Handbook" really drove this home to me - illustrating how even in our western democracies, our leaders tend to be more self-interested than is good for us.  And all of that just reinforces my growing attitude that we need to decentralize a little more and limit the concentration of power as it eventually corrupts, no matter what. 
Anyway, it's nice to hear viewpoints like yours, outside of the hardcore libertarian perspective which generally dominates this sub.  I think there's room for all of us.

This is the pragmatic answer, but maybe not the entire answer.  The full answer is that the bitcoin protocol can change at any time if it has network consensus (an agreement of the majority of nodes and users) on that change.  The reality is that node operators need highly compelling reasons to change existing consensus rules.  When they do, it's through either soft-fork (keeping the existing rules, but further tightening some subset of them) or hard-fork, where backwards compatibility is broken and a chain-split is likely.  The most likely way to achieve consensus is through the bitcoin github repository's [BIP]( system, which u/throwingdarts1 has described, and for which there is a formal submission, review, and approval process.

Trying to be real here - Bitcoin is highly speculative.  If it actually takes off as a popular medium of exchange or global reserve currency, it's value will be orders of magnitude higher, and it's difficult to factor in those odds.
I believe there is a current fundamental base value to the protocol, but that would be difficult to derive.  I suppose one might be able to tally up the dollar value of problems bitcoin is solving right now.  Here are the ones I see:
1) Frictions in international commerce and the degree to which bitcoin can alleviate those problems.  Probably include the remittances market along with this.
2) A store of wealth (or just medium of exchange) where governments are currently restricting access to specific currencies or forms of wealth - think Venezuela, India, or Chile.  You can get an idea of that relative level of interest [here](  
3) Black markets.  This one is decreasing in terms of the it's relative importance on price, but was arguably the original driver of usage and adoption.
Anyway, all that to say, I think it's going to significantly lower the cost and barriers to international trade in the future and at some point be quite desirable as a safe haven, unmanipulable, hard asset.  Most other bitcoin investors would likely agree.  I'm okay with paying for it at a level above its current fundamental demand, and merely allocate a small portion of my portfolio to crypto assuming the risk.  Bitcoin market cycles are quite common and should be expected.  I try to accumulate (DCA) more when price is relatively low (anytime over the next year will probably be good) and not lose my head in the wild bull runs.

I feel the same about him.  Some of his advice may yet be reasonable, but even so, I'd rather not put all my energy into making passive income off people in less fortunate circumstances.
Similarly Buffett, who gets a lot of respect, tends to like businesses that I feel are a net-negative on society, i.e., insurance co's., goldman-sachs, coca-cola, etc..  Sure, all those are profitable, but they also predominantly make money out of a conflict of interest with their customers.  It just seems like there are better ways to make a buck, even if it's less straightforward than being a slumlord or insurance broker.

Yes, that sounds like a good summary.  I would add a little more - the next logical step most of us come to is that the next advancement in crypto could render BTC obsolete.  This is unlikely for a number of reasons.  The first is that BTC's founder disappeared and the development, adoption, and mining continued organically in a fairly decentralized manner.  This level of decentralization and lack of concentrated power is an enormous and often overlooked advantage.  The second reason is that unlike with software or app development, where the pace of iteration and development is rapid, with money it necessarily pays to move slower and more conservatively.  BTC has a big advantage here in that it has the longest, most proven track record.  Third is the network effect (users and contributing developers) gives BTC quite a large lead.  Many alternative crypto projects which are touted as superior end up sacrificing the monetary policy, decentralization or security which make bitcoin so valuable in order to achieve something else novel - speed, throughput, privacy, or smart contract features.

This argument is only going to win over the hardcore libertarian segment, which is to say it's preaching to the choir.  Most of the rest of the world is realizing that climate change is a real thing most likely brought about by the 7 Billion people with intense energy demands on this planet.  The real problem is that we haven't yet determined as a society that socialized losses (CO2 emissions) shouldn't come free.  Once we, as a world population, have that, the rest will fall in place, and the market can decide where to allocate its energy resources.  If it were the case that all energy production was carbon negative, created jobs, and increased our standard of living, we wouldn't be having this conversation.  In that context, I think it's helpful to point out the benefits of bitcoin, and it's role in promoting cheap alternative energy production.

I think the hashrate now is higher than it would be otherwise due to the speculative nature of bitcoin.  The real question is what hashrate do we need, and what will future demand for block space look like.  During the last bubble, fees were something like one quarter of the block reward.  With higher overall adoption, surely there will be a stronger demand for base layer transactions, even if we have fully functional layer 2 or sidechains to offload much of the transaction volume.  That said, I wouldn't be opposed to a fixed (small) minting rate, similar to Grin.

To address their concern, describe mining - a process which helps the network and rewards bitcoin in return (you don't pay anyone for it, unlike a pyramid scheme).  Ask them how they would more fairly bootstrap a digital currency without making it freely available at first to anyone who wanted to participate and gradually restricting emission over time.  Describe the open and decentralized nature - how there is no one person at the top (unlike a pyramid) because all participants are peers.  In terms of ownership, I would also describe it more as a growing hill.  Yes, some people joined in earlier, but that hill also rounds off as the earlier participants gradually part with their coin.
Tell them about its purpose - an open, digital, trustless, censorship resistant sound money.  Get them a copy of Saifidean Ammous' T*he Bitcoin Standard*, or Andreas Antonopoulos' *The Internet of Money*.
Describe the Byzantine generals' problem - and how the distributed consensus bitcoin is based on was not possible before the problem's solution was devised.  Pyramid schemes are not generally motivated to wait on mathematical breakthroughs - and then devise their first practical implementation.
I might even get political.  Ask them if one person should wield the power to set global interest rates and monetary policy - plunging the world into recession and yanking it back again.  Should one person be able to resign a nation to starvation and hardship unless its citizens spontaneously organize and rise up to overthrow a problematic leader?  Should the world's poor be cut off from banking and the international economy because of what side of a national border they had the misfortune to be born on?

Same incentive as now - you don't have to rely on anyone else to relay your transactions, you have better privacy and control of your money.  For the miners, they still collect significant transaction fees even if the block reward is zero.

The black swan event I'm looking out for is: (simultaneously) paypal to stop holding up it's users' funds, credit cards to drop merchant fees and stop supporting scammers, reserve banks to stop inflating the monetary supply at will, consumer banks to be held to account, fees on remittances to be slashed, and foreign exchange premiums to drop as well as a better facilitation of international trade, a return to sound money and economic policy with a free-market based interest rate.
Actually, I think I'm at peace with that outcome. Never mind.
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:09:53
I guess what I'm opposed to is cutting users off from being able to operate their own node.  If we had a way to study the bandwidth, storage, and computing power of the internet connected citizens of the world, and make sure that block size is such that 80%+ can run their own validating full node without undue burden, then sure, why not.  However, as Luke Jr. has pointed out, we also have to look 10 years down the line.  The initial block download will be huge and the UTXO set will grow significantly.  Those should also be accounted for (by the way, they are increasing much more rapidly in the last 2 years than in the 8 previous).
The other part of this, is we would need a way to reach consensus on what those figures are.  Is it 2MB (current size roughly), 3MB?  How do we ensure the system isn't gamed?  It's not easy, and personally,  I value consensus and decentralization over the experimental at this point.
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:12:14
No, the price isn't purely speculation.  Bitcoin has real use cases and it is used to transact on a daily basis where it's an improvement on the status quo.  However, if the price were reflective solely of the protocol's current utility and level of adoption, it would be much lower and we would see a slower organic growth rather than breakneck market cycles.  Certainly some people are betting on Bitcoin having a greater importance and higher levels of adoption in the future.

I agree with your last sentence - there is more effort put into virtue signaling than into actual action.  If we want to engage and change minds though, we have to talk - otherwise we're just left with violence.  
  
If there's one cause I care more about than Bitcoin, it's our environment, and I think there's room for both.  Bitcoin mining can arguably be lighter on the environment than mining gold - the current hardest investment commodity/money in the world.  It can facilitate free trade and not ask the world's poor to starve to death in the midst of international currency wars like feudal serfs.  It can increase efficiency of remittances, enable micropayments potentially changing the power structure and incentives of the web (which right now pushes unabashed consumerism via advertising).  The point is that there are real benefits that could potentially change minds if we engage.  The other original point, was that we should talk about how we currently live in a tragedy of the commons, which is the real issue.

I agree.  Would gladly donate if I could verify it was legitimate.  So far as I can tell it appears to be a crowdfunding campaign for airtm and their wallet/exchange app.  I'm assuming it's a fully custodial service, and if we're talking $10 per acount, maybe that's not entirely unreasonable.  I also can't tell if users have direct access to their cryptocurrencies, how the campaign funds are paid out (which currency), etc..  Worst case is they're asking us to crowdfund alipay or paypal for Venezuelans.

A good friend of mine who has been very successful in the stock market (retired at 40) has done quite well by simply allocating funds in advance, and planning a series of buy-ins with a portion of those funds should the asset hit certain price targets.  For instance:
say we have 10K USD, we could allocate buy-ins any time the price drops 20% from the last point:
Price    Amt        (BTC)
4000    $2000     0.5
3200    $1860     0.58
2560    $1730     0.675
2050    $1610     0.785
1640    $1500     0.913
1300    $1390     1.06
The specific buy-in rate/allocation is far less important than just having a solid plan in advance and sticking to it.  Similarly, he would create a cash-out plan, in this case we might start at a price of $5K and cash out .5BTC and move up from there.
I can say I'll definitely be accumulating according to such a schedule, but also cashing out a portion whenever the next rally should occur (unlikely until late 2020 or 2021 imo).  I didn't cash any out during the 2017 run up because I only bought in that spring and didn't want to pay short term capital gains (that would have meant betting on a 30%+ correction just to break even).  I'll be well prepared in the next run however.

I don't know what's there to get so upset over - there's no real content or argument made in any of those pieces.  I'd love some real debate on the climate aspect, because I feel like Bitcoin will ultimately be a net positive for the environment (and humanity).  It's already done a fair amount to boost the profitability of renewable energy projects all over the world.  Also, the arguments about Joules/transaction are totally bogus.  It really only takes one raspberry pi's hashing power to keep the network running and transactions moving, the only reason we have more is because people like money so they mine for the block reward and transaction fees.
Drum could just as easily tell everyone that gold is a con because it's dirtier to mine, the people who already have it get richer when new folks buy in, etc..  Years from now it's not going to be such a problem because the block reward will be reduced, and everyday folks will be transacting on sidechains or lightning on sidechains - the main chain will be way too valuable for everyday Joes to use directly.
I find it interesting that some of the more vocal arguments against bitcoin stem from it's transparency - everyone can now see how much hashing power is spent (we can't see diesel fuel burned to mine gold), we can see whales moving funds (we can't see into commodities markets bought and sold in countries where the SEC has no jurisdiction) we can track coins that were owned by unscrupulous exchanges (but we have little visibility into giant banks laundering money).
Let's see and debate some real arguments.  Bring it on.

Use the liquid sidechain if cheap fees is what you value most, or XRP for all I care.
I value autonomy and decentralization, so I will not be supporting a fork to 8MB/32MB blocks because I would no longer be able to verify for myself.  Even 32MB blocks wouldn't get us worldwide scale - it would rapidly fill up, and we would still need a layer 2 and probably layer 3.
Sidechains, drivechains, and off-chain routing will all be part of our future. We can have any number of ways to hop between these layers - atomic swaps, submarine swaps, cross-chain routing.  The sooner we focus work on these exponential scaling solutions the better.  Bitcoin is nothing if we sacrifice decentralization and trustless operation, and making that sacrifice for short-lived linear scaling is a fool's errand.

I think the reason these articles are linked here is to show us what the end game of not having sound money can look like.  I don't know that anyone is advocating for Venzuelans to all suddenly study and adopt bitcoin, but for the rest of us, it's nice to have access to it well before things get to such an economic state as Venezuela.
I thought [Andreas' latest video]( was enlightening, if anecdotal, about the power of cryptocurrency under such circumstances.  Basically, his acquaintance hired web developers out of Venezuela for really cheap with bitcoin, and they were able to get themselves and their families out of there as things got worse.  Being able to have access to the international economy and accrue savings was vital for those individuals.

It should be becoming more and more obvious that power corrupts organizations just as it does politicians.  Decentralization serves as a check on that power.  Bitcoin (other cryptos too) are one part, but they don't take it far enough.  Sam Harris went from advertising supported podcasts to listener funded (through patreon) to avoid conflicts of interest or potential threats of defunding over topics/stances that advertisers may find objectionable.  He has now gone from patreon to his own website rolling his own subscription service and taking credit cards directly.  This was feasible for him with millions of listeners and significant donations, but it shouldn't be a barrier to free digital speech to people in general as it would be an insurmountable obstacle for many/most individuals.
We need decentralized alternatives to the way we share information and ideas and consume media and in the way content creators are supported.  Hopefully we can get there before too long and at least we have a base layer means of decentralized money transfer to support it.
