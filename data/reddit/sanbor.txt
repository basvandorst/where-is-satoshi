My advice is that before investing money, invest in learning. A good start is the currently free draft of the book [Mastering Bitcoin]( The first chapter will give you a great idea of how Bitcoin works.

That's a good point. My sentence was not very clear nor accurate.

According to [The Black Swan]( (the book, not the movie), predict the future based in ~~what happened in the past~~ history it's a mistake.

The wizard is cool, everybody loves the wizard. Maybe we should make it the official Bitcoin pet.
Dodgecoin has a dog, we have to have something (the currency symbol it's not enought).

Sorry about that! I checked before posting and couldn't find it. Maybe it was removed it? I'm surprised that Reddit doesn't check if the link was already published when submitting a link. Would you mind to provide a link to the post please? I'd to know what people is saying about it.

[Coinbase has this feature]( They also could ask for a year subscription, so if you're lazy you can pay once per year.

A huge thing to mention about AdBlock Plus is that they ask for money to some websites to maintain their "non-intrusive ads list". [Quoting their website]( "Whitelisting is free for all small- and medium websites and blogs. However, managing this list requires significant effort on our side and this task cannot be completely taken over by volunteers as it happens with common filter lists.That's why we are being paid by some larger properties that serve non-intrusive advertisements that want to participate in the Acceptable Ads initiative.". Because that, companies like Google, Amazon and Yandex pays to Eyeo, the company behind AdBlock Plus, to be in the white list.
IMHO there is a conflict of interests when the plugin that is designed to block ads are receiving money from some companies to display ads.

I logged in but when I hit the "Donate with bitcoin" banner at the bottom of the page nothing happens, and the banner href is just " I guess some JS is not being executed properly. I disabled uBlock in case it was blocking something and still the site doesn't works. I'm using Google Chrome.

Yes, I have the paper. I have to figure out how to turn those words into a private address.

N00b question: What's the advantage of this vs. paper wallet? You create a wallet with Electrum. You write down your seed in a piece of paper. You move your coin(s) to Electrum. You wipe your computer.

Fair enough. Is the government going to give back land that was not lawfully taken back to American natives?
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:07:18
That's a good point! However it might be an antifeature for a HOLDR, as you shouldn't spend your coins. If it get's broken you lose your coins. You could have a mnemonic seed as second backup but then you go back to paper wallet.
