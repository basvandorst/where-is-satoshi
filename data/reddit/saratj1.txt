Not that likely to burn your card from mining, you just have to monitor temps fans and dust. Chips have no moving parts so they don’t wear out in the traditional sense (fans do though). Heat cycles are more damaging than running at a constant state for a long period of time.
Bitcoin isn’t worth mining maybe some other ones could be worth doing depending on your gpu.

If that’s the scenario better start turning bitcoin into bullets and learn about farming instead of crypto currency. Collapse of the dollar would not be a pretty sight. 
As other victims of failed monies have found out you can’t eat dollar bills.

No way to prove you wrong but a 6k bitcoin this time next year is still a very plausible scenario. It’s not all gains just a matter of how much losses are possible too.

No shame in selling at 7k if you bought at like $200 though

That’s a bad graph why have only one year of bitcoins growth and compare that to 10years of other investments growth why not just have bitcoins growth from the beginning.

Like buying one place selling somewhere else?
I don’t see it much different from day trading, likely to work in a market skyrocketing up, in a stable or down market it may be tricky

I agree with those ideals but I find in practice they are hard to come by. I could buy btc locally face to face and be as close to anonymous as you can get but that has a whole other set of hazards you have to be wary of. I agree Coinbase is in with the gov and will sell me out in a second if it came to it. But at the same time they are about as legit as it gets as far as crypto businesses go.

That’s like saying fuck air travel because tickets are expensive and sometimes planes crash. While yes that’s true it’s still a very convenient safe and cost effective method of travel. Coinbase while somewhat pricey, and not without issues is still very legitimate way to get your cash into crypto.
