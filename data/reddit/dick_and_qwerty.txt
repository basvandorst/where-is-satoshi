How would a possible 51% attacker be sure they have 51% percent or more then? After all, others could be withholding blocks as well?

I actually love mead. I make my own.

I regularly see BitMessage posts here. No offense to the BM guys meant, but this has nothing to do with Bitcoin at all.
So why don't you remove those posts as well? Better keep up to what you're claiming or leave the censoring to the board.

I cringe whenever I read something like this.

My two satoshis on this point:
Mining right now must still be profitable, even at these low BTC prices nowadays. Otherwise hashing power wouldn't grow as insanely fast as it is currently doing. If a miner plans a large operation for which they have to put down several k$ they'll better do their calculations properly, so you can expect that if mining is no longer profitable hashing power would decrease, but we are not seeing this right now. And we can't expect miners to sell their mined BTCs at a loss because that would be economic insanity.
For me it follows that miners don't care about the long term potential of BTC but are rather in it for the quick buck. Otherwise they would sell less and hold more which they could because, as shown above, mining is still profitable. Even if some miners dump a lot to force prices down, to drive miners that hodl out of the market, they'll do themselves a disservice because they are reducing overall hashing power and thereby the utility and value of the Bitcoin infrastructure.
So yes, miners are somewhat subverting the system. They are the ones that really profit from the Bitcoin system, not any poor Africans or the few wealthy early whales. I wonder whether behaviour is actually sustainable.
May be wrong, so if you know better, please speak up.

Yeah really, that's nonsense. Good for publicity, nothing else.
Would be much better to actually put a private key on each balloon. Then, if nobody claimed the money after two weeks, transfer it back. The beauty of Bitcoin: send out your money and keep it if nobody wants it ;-)

Well, don't think that this is about terrorists.
That would be dumb.

Right. Gold as an inflation hedge wouldn't make sense for most Greeks at all.

Yes, Bitcoin is pretty secure. And as long as you don't publicly state "this is my address" and prove it mathematically, it's even quite anonymous.
