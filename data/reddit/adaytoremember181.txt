Just my opinion but I’d buy more if you have the cash to play with. Bitcoin is nearly ten years old and has always gone up and down. Buy the dips my friend. And look at how much it’s fluctuated in the past

If the price is keeping you from buying more cause you dislike getting less for your buck that’s kinda the whole idea here. It’s really better to just dollar cost average what you can afford

Do you mine alts and then trade to Bitcoin? I do happen to have free electricity. I’ve just wondered off and on if I should mine. I remember back in 2013 people said it wasn’t worth it to mine Bitcoin. With how much it’s risen that’s absurd of course. I wonder if the same is true for today if you mine cheap alts for trading.

Is it worth it to mine alts with rigs?

I have a laptop. I’ve started buying Bitcoin every paycheck. Small amounts but better than nothing.

Ahh okay. I’ll have to learn more about this. Is that the only way you can mine them?

Why does mining burst coin not affect electricity use?

Just like aol lost long term. And blockbuster. There are winners and losers in every industry and the innovators win

Let's say an early investor had enough Bitcoin equivalent to $250,000. This investor decides to sell it all. Would said investor be able to sell and transfer only 10k for that day? Would they be able to sell all of it for the current price or would they be subject to selling at different prices because they can't sell it all at once.

That's very interesting. I wonder how hard of a time people have had trying to sell large amounts of Bitcoin to withdrawal a lot of cash

In my situation I don't pay for electricity. The landlord does. Should I consider mining?

Does a higher level of verification allow you to move more than $2500?

Unless what he mines increases in value later right?

What about when you want to exchange BTC for cash. Which exchange do you trust to let you take out cash?
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:09:18
Even if you keep them off an exchange you have to use an exchange to get cash. Can you trust an exchange to give you your cash upon withdrawal?
