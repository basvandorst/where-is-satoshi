Bought via coinbase not the exchange (Gdax/coinbasepro). When you purchase through coinbase, it takes about 7-10 for the transaction to be completed. In this period the price fluctuated insane amounts and the order was cancelled on their behalf.
It's available in my account history, yes. I'm curious as to what people think. Personally I've always thought there was zero I could do so I just brushed it off. Never did I think to ask for other's input. Just curious

and not made up, but zero care whether or not you believe I made a purchase @ $90. Feels good to know it sounds unbelievable. Makes me smarter that I was aware at such a time
