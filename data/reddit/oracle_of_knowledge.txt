Each bar is one month of price movement.  The thick part of the bar shows the "opening" and "closing" price for that bar period and the little stick through the middle shows the total variation within the month.
So for example we'll look at October 2017 since that's the month the OP had his cursor on.  You can see at the top of the page it says Open 4339.01, which would be the price on the first of the month.  The High and Low were 6472.13 and 4150.01 (the stick that is barely sticking out of the top and bottom of the thick bar).  And the Close was 6445.01 on October 31st.
"Zoom Out" is aggregating the data into larger chunks which is a way to smooth out the data.
Here's another example showing a Weekly, Daily, and 12 Hour data breakdown for the past six months.   Clumping the data together makes the bumps and dips cancel out and give you a bigger picture of price movement.

But transferring BTC from Coinbase to GDAX isn't a blockchain transfer.  It's an offchain account update in Coinbase's system.  There should be no "btc backlog" for this.

I wouldn't consider it a reasonable currency replacement either.  That's why I didn't mention "currency replacement" in the list of attributes.
With improvements it could be usable as a currency again in the future, or at least be more currency-like.  Bitcoin (and crypto in general) is a new thing, you don't have to put it in a box.  "This is a currency."  Well, kinda.  "This is an asset class."  Well, sure.  "This is a store of value."  Yeah, that too.

There's a drop-down in the upper left that says 1W. You are showing one week bars (which matches the top picture in the image I posted with three charts). Click that drop down and there should a 1M to show one month aggregated bars.
December opened at like 10k Dec 1st and finished at like 14k Dec 31st, so it was still overall up for the month.  In the OP's chart you can see the wick of the candle spiking up to the 19k that we saw during December.

I bought 11 BTC for $8000 (so $727 per coin) in December of 2013.  It didn't cross $727 per coin again until December 2nd 2016.
The $8000 was play money, I could lose it all without feeling it.  So I held on, kept buying more through the slump years.   I finally sold one of those December 2013 bitcoins on last year in May when it was around $1700, and have been selling a little here-and-there since.
So, like everyone screams all the time **don't invest more than you can safely lose**.   Otherwise just shut up and ride it out.

The biggest problem with Bcash is the attempts to usurp the Bitcoin name.  If they had just forked and then fucked off to do their own thing, no one would care.   But the Bcash mantra is all "Satoshi's Vision" and going so far as just referring to themselves as Bitcoin, and trying to paint real BTC as "Bitcoin Core, owned by Blockstream, a tainted, slow, backwards plan that runs counter to the White Paper."
Again, if Bcash had just fucked off and done its thing like any other AltCoin, that would be fine.  No one in BTC gets pissed off at what LTC or Ether or Monero is doing.  But Bcash stands as a direct attack on BTC, and supporters of the original Bitcoin are pretty upset and frustrated about it.
I try and just ignore Bcash and treat them as any other AltCoin.  It gets annoying seeing the constant "raids" into with commenters spamming "What about the fees!!!!" every other post.  Report, Downvote, Don't Engage, and Move On.

What would I do?  I have 1 BTC with a basis of $10,000.  I have 0.1025 BTC with a basis of $0.00.  I sell it all for $21850.   
I report I have a gain of (21850 - 10000) = $11,850 and pay tax on that.  I would use an argument of Good Faith Effort as an exception to any penalties if the IRS did happen to come after me for whatever small percentage of tax I may have over / under paid.
(You don't provide enough information to do it "the long way."  You'd need the USD price for all of those exchanges in order to know all of the intermediate gains and losses and the respective new cost basis.)

My charts are pure fraud?  All I did was SHOW ALL DATA, took a screenshot, then checked box for LOG SCALE, and took another screenshot.
How is that pure fraud.  It's just the actual fucking data.


Your original post talked about the crash of 2013, which is why my commentary was about the crash (and not the meteoric rise).  And the "losing 75% of its value" took a pretty long time.  It quickly dropped 50% from the ATH of Dec 2013, bounced back to $900, then took a year before it saw sub $300 levels (the 75% drop from ~$1200).   It bottomed out in January of 2015 at $160.  And then it took another 18 months (the very long road) to recover back toward $1000.
So... like exactly what I posted.   Eventually sagging to 20% of the ATH over a year and a half (more like 1 year), then another year and a half (more like 2 years) of slowly climbing back to that level.

If you only have 0.003 bitcoin, just leave it on Coinbase.  You start trying to move that small amount of bitcoin around and it will disappear in transaction fees.  For such a small amount, it's safe enough on Coinbase.

Here's a quick example of "the long way" with every intermediate trade being taxed, and "the easy way" that I'm going to use:
You can add fees to your basis, and deduct fees from your gains.  If you are paying fees on all those intermediate steps you can save a bit on your trades.  Personally I'm only going to claim capital gains taxes when I convert crypto to USD.

I'm annoyed because it's such an eye-rolling question.
Why does bitcoin have value?  Because it's an immutable ledger.  Because it cannot be forged.  Because it has a limited supply.  Because it can be transferred peer to peer with no third party interference.  Because it's anti-fragile.  Because it's fungible.  Because it's private.  
Bitcoin as a token has value because people place a monetary value on the above properties.

I'm not sure how that chart will relate to "show us the crash of 2013 and how long it took to recover" since 6 months after the crash doesn't show the full recovery (which took 3 years), but okay.
What does this chart tell us?
Again, I was just replying to your OP, asking to show the recovery from 2013 crash, which took 3 years, so I just showed all of the data.
Maybe you want this one instead: 6 months before Dec 2013, and through to January of 2017 when we broke $1k again:
That one shows the crash and recovery the best, yes?  I don't know why you keep crying out "fraud" when I'm just talking about what YOU want to talk about.

I think he's using the term "Atomic Swap" a bit incorrectly.  But here's an example of where swapping currency can save fees:
I have 1 BTC on Coinbase.  I want to send that 1 BTC over to Bittrex.
On Coinbase you can buy 1 LTC for 0.01685 BTC.    So you buy 59.347 LTC.  You pay a 0.002 LTC fee (~$0.50 USD) and send 59.345 LTC to Bittrex.
Now over on Bittrex the exchange rate is 0.01684 BTC per LTC, so trade your 59.345 LTC for 0.9993698 BTC.  You lost 0.00063202 BTC (~$10.00) in the trade because of different exchange rates.   This is less than you'd pay for an on-chain Bitcoin transaction, and faster too (LTC blocks every 2.5 minutes).
What DimeInPieces is envisioning is somehow having this occur in the background automatically.  It wouldn't really work for merchants or wallets.   Atomic Swaps are on-chain transactions so wouldn't save fees.  
Here's a little article on atomic swaps to get an idea of what they are.

Okay?  And *current* LTC fees are $0.50 with a per token value of $270.  And Bcash fees are currently $0.25 with a token value of $2800 and a tenth of BTC volume.
If BTC were only sending 2000 transactions per hour, its fees would be low too.
"Look how cheap the transaction fees are on this thing over here that no one is transacting with."  Cool.

It's a log scale, which is appropriate for showing percentage changes.  If this were a linear scale then everything up to 2017 would be a straight horizontal line, and then starting in like May of 2017 it would be come a straight vertical line.  That graph would show you nothing.

$200k is about 12 times the current price of $16,500.   $16,500 is about 12 times $1361.
So time travel back to May of 2017 when the price was $1361, and ask incedulously "Who are the people that are going to buy bitcoin at $17,000?"  Back is May that would be a hilarious question.  Turns out the answer in May of 2017 would be "The people six months from now, that's who."

I'll just copy paste a bunch of stuff from the structuring wiki:
In the United States, the Bank Secrecy Act requires the filing of a currency transaction report for transactions of more than $10,000 in currency (US or foreign).[2] Financial institutions suspecting deposit structuring with intent to avoid the law are required to file a suspicious activity report.[3] In 1986, the U.S. Congress enacted section 5324 of Title 31 of the United States Code,[4] which provides (in part):
No person shall, for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of section 5313 (a) or 5325 or any regulation prescribed under any such section, the reporting or record keeping requirements imposed by any order issued under section 5326, or the record keeping requirements imposed by any regulation prescribed under section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or section 123 of Public Law 91–508—[...] (3) structure or assist in structuring, or attempt to structure or assist in structuring, any transaction with one or more domestic financial institutions.
Section 5324 further provides that a violation of this provision may be punished by a fine or up to five years in prison, or both.[5] The filing of Form 8300 is required under Internal Revenue Code section 6050I.[6]
Sums of money resulting from deposits of less than $10,000 may be seized after a warrant is issued based on a suspicious activity report.

I just posted about this the other day.  On December 22nd it flash-crashed from $14k down to like $11k over a couple hours mid-day, which triggered MSM articles about "Bitcoin loses 1/3rd of its value in 24 hours."  Of course it was back to $14k by the end of the day.
"Bitcoin prices plunged sharply to below $11,000 on Friday, shedding a third of its value in just 24 hours, according to data from CoinDesk.com. It later rebounded slightly to around $12,000 -- but that's still a stunning 25% less valuable than bitcoin was Thursday morning."

The 10 minutes per block doesn't have anything to do with fees.   The miners on the network will mine a block every 10 minutes.  In any individual block is a collection of transactions they have selected from the mempool.  Your priority in the mempool is dictated by the transaction fee you attach to your transaction.  If the mempool is empty, a transaction fee of 20 satoshi per Byte will probably get selected and added to the next block.  If the mempool is full, it might take 150 satoshi to make sure you are in the next block.  (If you put it up for 20 satoshi, it might take 4, 8, or 13 blocks before your transaction gets selected by the miners.)
But, once your transaction DOES get selected and added to a block, the only wait is the ~10 minutes until the next block got found.  Your transaction is already on the blockchain.  Additional confirmations are just the additional blocks built on top of **your** block.
Are you just looking for this?

Here is an example:
Buy $1000 @ $4650 per BTC, 0.215 053 76 BTC
Now BTC is $11350 per BTC and you want to sell $1000 worth.  So you are going to sell 0.088 105 73 BTC.
Here is how the taxes would work.  You'd have to split your original buy into two lines, one to match how much you sold, and one for how much you have left over.
Sell 0.088 105 73 BTC for $1000, which was originally worth $409.69 (aka the Basis)
Keep 0.126 948 03 BTC which was originally worth $590.31 (aka the Basis).  (In the future when you sell this BTC, you would use $590.31 as your cost basis).
So you sold 0.088... BTC that had a basis of $409.69, for $1000.  So you had capital gains of $590.31.  This is what you would owe taxes on.  And since you sold your asset within a year of obtaining it, it would be short term capital gains, which is the same tax rate as normal income.

I don't understand the question.
You go Limit, Sell, 1 BTC for $18000.  Your order gets put on the order book, waiting for a buyer.
If the price moves up to $18,000, your order will be matched with a Buyer, your order comes off the Book, and you get $18,000 deposited to your USD balance.
Likewise you can put a Limit Buy order in, for 1 Bitcoin at $17,000.  If the price drops to $17,000, you will be matched with a Seller who will take your $17,000 and 1 BTC will show up in your balance.

You got ripped off by an ATM, it has nothing to do with bitcoin.  That ATM is giving you a spread from the exchange price, and charging you a flat fee on top of that.  
If you knew exchange / market price was $20,800 CAD, why would you sell your bitcoin for $16,900 to the machine?
Price right now is $16,000 USD.  If I go on Local Bitcoin I will find people offer to sell for $17,000 and offering to buy for $15,000.  So that's a "spread" of ± $1000.   Your bitcoin ATM was buying for $4000 CAD below market, and probably would have been selling bitcoin for $24,900.
You chose to take that deal.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:10:03
I'm guessing that you are trying to make a market sell order.  A market order will sell at the current price, but also will charge you a fee.  (A small fee, 0.25%.  Way less than fees you'll see from Buy It Now on Coinbase.)
If you don't want fees, you will need to make a Limit Order and specify the per BTC price you want to Buy/Sell at, and the Qty of BTC you want to Buy/Sell.  If you place a limit order, you can considered a Market Maker and you don't get a trading fee.

If you withdraw BTC from GDAX, GDAX will pay the miner fee.  So I would recommend withdrawing from GDAX.
If the BTC is currently in your Coinbase BTC Wallet, you'll need to log into GDAX and transfer it over to GDAX.
On your GDAX dashboard, click the Deposit button, then click the Coinbase Account tab, and change the Source dropdown to your My Wallet (BTC).  Put in how much Bitcoin (or there should be a button to click for MAX), and Deposit Funds.   The transfer from Coinbase to GDAX is free and instant.

Different exchanges have different trading pairs.  For example, you can go on Coinmarketcap.com and check out GDAX:
Here you can see there are nine total trading pairs.  You can buy Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum with USD.   You can also buy Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum with Euros.   Bitcoin can be purchased for Great Britain Pounds.  And finally you can trade Bitcoin for Litecoin and Ethereum.
If you look at Bittrex, there are apparently 271 trading pairs.  Note that each pair has its own order book, so the book might be super super thin (meaning no one is really trading).  You want to look at the trading pair's total volume to see how "true" the price is going to be.
If you want to figure out where you can buy a certain currency, click on the big "Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization" at the top of the page to go to the main page that lists all the coins.  Click on a coin to go to its page, scroll down a little to the charts section and click the Markets tab.    This will show you all the markets, sorted by volume, and what the trading pair is.  Then you have to figure out which exchanges service the country you are from, and look around for reviews about which are best.

*If I go look up that transaction, Coinbase made me pay 240.8 satoshis per Byte for the transaction. And if I look at the Mempool on November 2nd, it looks like I could have gotten away with 20-30 or 30-50 sat/B fees (since I was just moving off of Coinbase to hardware and didn't need my transaction to go through in 10 minutes).

No.  Your account number and routing number not at all private information.  It is listed on every check you write.  A private key would be like your log-in credentials that would authorize someone to actually move money.


No it's not.  Your wallet address would be like your bank account number.   It's all someone else would need in order to send you money.  The wallet address also (because of the nature of bitcoin) will tell anyone who looks at it how much money is in it, so it differs from your bank account number in this way. 


I mean, they **can** in the most literal sense of "it's possible."  If you are talking about an exchange, they are custodians of your money the same way a bank would be.  Cash in a bank isn't "yours" and the bank **could** do pretty much anything with your money.  Cash in your hand (or BTC in your own wallet) would be ultimately yours.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:19:02
I'll explain the two for you.
The above URL is the one I used back when I made paper wallets.   Think of a paper wallet as a single bitcoin address.  If you go to that website and follow the steps, it will generate a Private Key (you keep this secret) and that key's corresponding Public Address.  These would be two QR codes printed on the same piece of paper.   To put BTC onto the paper wallet you scan / enter the Public Address into whatever site / exchange / wallet you have your BTC and then send it.
Now that bitcoin is in the paper wallet's single address.  If you scan / enter the public address that's on the paper wallet into a blockchain explorer website, it would show your bitcoin in that address.
Now how to get it off?  Well, you should never try and spend directly from a paper wallet.  (It's a little complicated, but if you spent from a paper wallet the wrong way you might end up screwing up the "change address" and all the leftover bitcoin would go to the miner as a fee.)  Instead, you should "sweep" the paper wallet into another wallet.  For example, on the Samourai wallet it looks like this:
Upper right hand corner, it says "Sweep Private Key."  This will bring up your camera app, you would scan the Private Key QR code that's on your Paper Wallet (the Private Key being the part that says you have control of the address), and it will "Sweep" or issue a transaction to move ALL the bitcoin from that paper wallet into your Samourai wallet.
As for Mnemonic Phrases, this would be the 12 word "Seed" you get when you set up an HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet.  And HD wallet (like one on a PC or Phone) creates a BUNCH of addresses that are all contained in the same HD wallet.   Each address is created based on those 12 seed words, which means restoring a lost HD wallet is as easy as re-inputing those 12 seed words back into a wallet app.
If you want to use an HD wallet, I'd recommend Samourai since they have implemented SegWit addresses.  Just download the app and follow the directions.  Write down the seed words and put them somewhere safe.  And a copy of them somewhere else safe.  Those seed words ARE YOUR WALLET, so keep it secret and safe and preferably not online (like, don't email it to yourself or put it in dropbox).
After you have the HD wallet set up you can just send your bitcoin to it.  If you ever lose your phone or the app gets deleted or something, you can always restore your wallet using the 12 seed words.

In my humble opinion, it's fucking stupid.  Really really fucking stupid.  People chant around here about moving off of exchanges because of "not your keys, not your bitcoin."  But there's way more trust in Coinbase as a registered financial custodian that is running an exchange, compared to some dude in Holland with a SquareSpace storefront who is printing keypairs in his garage.
It blows my mind that anyone would think for a second that this would be a good idea.   Now if you were sending him a BIP38 encrypted private key to print on a card, that would be one thing.  But HE is generating the keys?  That's just moronic.

As soon as you broadcast the transaction and the network sees it, Mycelium will update the account values to say "0.001353 BTC sent, pending"
If you put in 0 sat/B transaction fee, that message will still come up, but the BTC will never transfer.  So it could be a risk to the receiver if you broadcast a no-fee transaction, he sees the "BTC pending" message and gives you the thumbs up to leave.  This is the "0 Confirmation" transaction people sometimes talk about when discussing it being safe to buy coffee.  0 Confirmation is only safe if the TX fee is reasonable.

Your transaction must be consolidating many different unspent outputs.  I had a nine output transaction that ended up being 1405 bytes.  And a five output transaction that was 780 bytes.  Those were all non-segwit though.
I had a Trezor to Samourai transaction, SegWit to SegWit, one output to two address, and it was 247 bytes.

*I am not an accountant.
If you are keeping the BTC instead of selling it, then I would treat the amount received as income at whatever the current trade value is.  That value would become the "basis" of the asset.  In the future you would pay capital gains tax when you sold the asset.
Example:  11/25/2017 you sold a painting for 1 bitcoin when bitcoin is $9000 each.  You decide to hold the bitcoin.  For your 2017 taxes you would add $9000 to your earned income and pay taxes as appropriate.
Two years later you decide to sell the bitcoin.  Bitcoin is now worth $23,000.   You have held it longer than a year, so it's long term cap gains.  The amount of gain is ($23,000 - $9000) = $14,000.  Sold Price minus Basis.  You would owe long term capital gains on that $14,000.  Depending on how much your income level is in 2020 (and if the law changes), you'll owe 0%, 15%, or 20% on those long term gains.

The end result will be a piece of paper with two QR codes on it.  The Public Address QR code is what you send bitcoin to.  In your wallet app, go to Send, Scan QR Code, and then scan that public address QR.
The other QR code on the piece of paper is the Private Key.  This is what the recipient will use to "sweep" the paper wallet into their wallet app.

From July of this year, this particular Bitcoin Sign Guy is:  "While the Chair of the Federal Reserve, the American Central Bank, Janet Yellen was speaking to the House Financial Services Committee yesterday, someone held up a sign saying "buy bitcoin"." 
That address has received about 7 BTC.  Who they are from, who knows.  He could have sent himself some BTC; prime that tip jar, as it were.
One of (the original?) sign guy was at a college football game in December 2013.  He held a sign with a QR code that said "HI MOM SEND" and then the Bitcoin logo.  That address saw 23 BTC come into it.

Right, but there's constantly new transactions being added to the mempool all the time too.   
When you look at the graph
look at a section like this:  
Look at the fourth band up, like the violet band, of 10-20.  Visually that band looks pretty constant for that 2 hour span where like 12 blocks were mined.   But there are constantly TXs being added to the mempool, and I'd imagine at least a decent portion of them are 10-20 sat/B.
So how is that band a constant width?   Miners must be including some 10-20 sat/B transactions in those blocks, even though there are a PILE of higher TXs on top, right?
So that is my question.  Is there a way to see how many, or a ratio, of how many of each TX is in each block?
Mid-Post Before Even Posted Edit:  Yeah, I don't know.  I just zoomed in on a section where a block happened:  
And looked at the TX quantities at the two spikes.
And yeah, it's pretty much all cleared top down.  This block cleared essentially 100% of the 140+ sat/B transactions, and cleared 72% of the 100-140 sat/B txs, but cleared NONE less than that.

Have you set up your Trezor yet?  Do that first.  Follow the instructions that came with the Trezor, it should take you like 15 minutes to set up.  Part of the process is writing down 24 words.  Write those down, put them somewhere safe (like, in safe).  Those 24 words can be used to restore your wallet if anything ever happens to your Trezor.  
Keep in mind that 24 word seed IS YOUR WALLET.  Do not let anyone see them, don't post them online, don't even like email them to yourself.
Okay, once your Trezor is set up and you have your wallet made, go to the Trezor Wallet   Your Trezor should be connected to your PC.  In the wallet app in the browser, go to our BTC account and click Receive tab to get an address.   Then go to your Blockchain.info wallet and send your BTC to the Trezor address.
1) Cost: I don't know if Blockchain.info lets you set your fee.  I don't know how many inputs the transaction will be.  If you assume a 300 byte transaction and use a 100 sat/B fee, that is 30,000 satoshis or 0.00030000 BTC fee.  Right now that's about $3.50.
2) If your Trezor dies or you lose you, you will need your 24 word seed in order to "recreate" your wallet.  All of the public / private key pairs are generated using those 24 words, so as long as you know those 24 words you can recreate exactly the same keys.
3) Process complex or risky?  I mean, it's a little complex but not really risky.  You can't really make a mistake and lose everything.  Go slow, double check the addresses you are using, and it will all be fine.

You have USD in your account:
Market Buy: "Give me 2 BTC for whatever the market price is."  Your order will be instantly matched to someone on the order book (the top Sell order).
Limit Buy: "Give me 2 BTC for $12,400 per BTC."  Your order will be put on the order book along with everyone else who wants to buy for not-market price.  If the market price moves down to $12,400, then your order will start getting filled by sellers (automatically by the system).
Stop Buy: "If  the market price ever goes above $13,000, put in an order to buy 2 BTC at the market price."  This is the "holy shit the market is moving up and I don't want to miss out, get me in right now!" order.  You could have your money "out" in USD, waiting for a dip, but have a Stop Buy in the system do you don't miss the next run up.
You have BTC in your account:
Market Sell:  "I want to sell 2 BTC for whatever the market price is."  Your order will be instantly matched to someone on the order book (the top Buy order).
Limit Sell: "I want to sell 2 BTC for $12,750 per BTC."  Your order will be put on the order book along with everyone else who wants to sell for not-market price.  If the market price moves up to $12,750 then your order will start getting filled by buyers.
Stop Order, Or Stop Loss Order:  "If the market price ever drops down to $11,000, put up my 2 BTC for sale as a market order."  This is a "holy shit the price is dropping and I want to sell my bitcoin before it drops any more" option.  As soon as the trigger price is reached, you will sell your BTC for whatever the market is moving to.  It might be 0.5 BTC at $11,000, then 1.2 BTC at $10,950, then 0.3 BTC at $10,800.  There is this "slippage" with a stop loss.  You aren't guaranteed to get your stop-loss number ($11,000 in this case) as your sell price.

Sure, but then you would have access to the wallet, and anyone who may have intercepted the message, or in the future intercept the message, would have access to the wallet.
So the solution is, once the wallet ends up in Australia, they would take that wallet and send the BTC to a new address that only they control.
Which... got you absolutely nowhere.

Assuming it's an average 250 byte transaction, you paid about 100 satoshi / byte as your fee.
When you submit a transaction to the network it goes into a holding area called the mempool.  All submitted transactions go hang out in the mempool, and miners select transactions from the mempool to be included in the blocks they mine.   Miners select transactions from the "top down" when it comes to fees.   200 sat/B will be taken before 150 sat/B, and 150 sat/B will be taken before 100 sat/B.
Depending on how much activity is on the network, there can be a backlog of transactions waiting to be selected.  You can see the current status of the mempool on multiple websites but I prefer Johoe's:
The colored bands represent transaction fee ranges.   Right now the grey range (100-140 sat/B) is not really getting touched.  The blue band above it (140-200 sat/B) is getting worked through a little every block, and everything above 200 sat/B is being cleared every block.
The saw-tooth on the top is when blocks are created, so you can see where it's cutting down into the various bands.
If you zoom out to 2 Days (button at the top) you can see yesterday morning between 4am and 8am, see how low the fees were.  Blocks were clearing down into the 20-30 sat/B fee range.
But bitcoin is going a bit bananas right now (if you haven't noticed) so there is a lot of competition for the space on the block.  That's why fees are "high" right now at 140-200 sat/B.

Move BTC to GDAX first before transferring it out to your personal wallet.  GDAX pays the miner fee on BTC withdrawls


You are using a bunch of words but none of them really go together to form a coherent question here.

@_date: 2017-12-04 06:51:14
Yes the ratio is 1:1:1.  The private key generates the public key, which is then hashed to create the Address.
The wallet can contain any number of key pairs.  Kind of dumbed down, but an HD wallet (one created by 12 seed words), creates private keys by running a function on a counter (1,2,3,4,5...) and your seed.  Like 
MakePrivateKey(1HorseStapleBatteryRadioSuperNinjaBackhandWasherPoolAuntMoonToilet) = [private key 1]
MakePrivateKey(2HorseStapleBatteryRadioSuperNinjaBackhandWasherPoolAuntMoonToilet) = [private key 2]
MakePrivateKey(3HorseStapleBatteryRadioSuperNinjaBackhandWasherPoolAuntMoonToilet) = [private key 3]
This is why, as long as you have your 12 seed words, you can always recreate all the addresses in a wallet.  You just run that Private Key Generation function on the Counter and Seed and it will spit out all the same private keys.
As for Public Keys in a transaction: The recipient gives their address.   You send the transaction from your address / public key.  This is the point where your public key gets exposed.  They can hash the public key to verify that it is the correct address, and then you sign the transaction with your private key to prove you control the coins in that address.
Again, this is a bit dumbed down.  The wallet does a lot of the work for you, and you aren't really sending bitcoin from a single address but rather you are sending unspent outputs.... the nuts and bolts can be a bit technical.

I think the glib response of "If you don't own the keys you don't own the bitcoin" needs to get a bit more nuanced for the newer people entering the bitcoin world. To a layman, saying "You don't own the bitcoin if you keep it on Coinbase" has a different meaning than intended.
Yes, you do **own** the bitcoin if it's held in your Coinbase account, you just don't fully *control* it. There is no absolute guarantee that you will be able to withdraw it in the future should some crazy event happen. However, if you withdraw it from Coinbase, you absolutely have 100% control over that money.

Just 1 confirmation is fine.  It ensures that the transaction had enough fees to make it onto a block.  And after it's on a block, it's essentially 100% infeasible (speaking in the context of a local cash transaction) for a double spend or reversal of some sort to occur.

They are a crypto exchange.  Bcash is an altcoin that is traded on exchanges.  Coinbase is already splitting the forked coins for their users, so they might as well list it on their exchange to let their customers trade it.

It make sense for Coinbase to add BCH support at the same time they roll out the forked coins to their user base.  "Here's your BCH.  And by the way, as of today, we have order books for BCH so you can trade all the BCH you just got."

Yeah, if you sweep the paper wallet into the HD wallet it will be in one of the addresses in the HD wallet.  
Think of an HD wallet like a book.  Every page of the book is a different Private Key / Public Address pair generated using the seed.  Page 1 is Key / Address 1 which was generated with 1SeedWordOneTwoThreeFourThroughTwelve, Page 2 is Key / Address 2 which was generated with 2SeedWordOneTwoThreeFourThroughTwelve, etc etc.
Every time you send or receive or use a change address, it's a brand new address made on the next page.  And on the "front cover" of the book is the total amount of Unspent Outputs that are contained in all of the addresses contained in the wallet (your total BTC balance).  When you generate a transaction, your wallet as access to any / all of those unspent outputs that it can use to make a transaction.
My old Mycelium HD wallet has 106 total Private Keys contained in the "book."

GDAX fee for BTC to USD is 0 if you are a Maker (place a limit order).    Taker fee is at most 0.25% (place a market order) and scales down with personal trading volume in the same way Gemini does.
I don't know what the wire fees are, I do not have that enabled.  Standard 3-5 day bank withdraw is free.
USD withdraw limit is $10,000 per day with a verified account.  You can apply for increased withdraw limits but I have not bothered to go through the process.  The web form lets you select how much limit you want ($50k, $100k, $150k, $200k... max on the list is $25M), a comment box for "Why are you requesting a higher limited?", a spot to attach a LinkedIn Profile (recommended, and a bit weird to me), and a bank statement (also just recommended).
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:41:44
Sure, that would work if the price moves like that.
The problem is when you put $1000 in, sell it at $1200, but then it goes up to $1300.   
Then you say "Oh shit!" and buy back in at $1300, but it drops to $1100.  You freak out and think it's going to keep dropping so you sell for $1100, but then it rockets up to $1400.  "Fuck fuck, I gotta get back in."   So you buy for $1400 and then it sits and does nothing for 6 months.
EDIT:  That said, you can use this strategy as long as you have capital on both sides.  "If the price goes down 10% I will buy $100 worth.  If the price goes up 10% I will sell $100 worth."   This is a perfectly sound plan as long as you 1) have enough USD to buy all the way down in a dip and 2) you are okay with liquidating all BTC if the price keeps going up up up.

BCash fork was August 1st, so no Bcash.
BGold fork was October 24th, so you would have some BGold tokens on their blockchain.

Because it takes that long for a Coinbase-initiated bank transfer to fully clear.  You click Buy It Now to lock in the price, but then they need to initiate the bank transfer, get the money, wait for the backend to clear up, then finally release your BTC.
If you have the money in your Coinbase / GDAX account already, you can buy directly on the GDAX exchange and you'll have your BTC available immediately.

You receive 1 bitcoin worth $9000.  You claim $9000 as income.  You sell half a bitcoin for $4500.  You don't pay any short term capital gains (basis was $4500 for that 0.5 bitcoin, you gains $4500, so no taxable gains).  And your remaining 0.5 BTC just hangs out with a basis of $4500 until you sell it.
Now what if you got that bitcoin, waited a week, then sold half.
You receive 1 bitcoin worth $9000.  You claim $9000 as income.  You sell half a bitcoin for $6000.  (market price has increased to $12k per BTC).  You would pay short term capital gains (which is same tax rate as your normal income tax) on 6000-4500 = $1500.   So that would be like an additional $1500 in normal income (but it's listed in the Short Term Capital Gains area).  And your remaining 0.5 BTC just hangs out with a basis of $4500 until you sell it.

A paper wallet is a single bitcoin address.  The piece of paper will have both the Private Key and Public Key printed on it.  You then send bitcoin from your wallet (a wallet is a collection of multiple addresses) to your single address Paper Wallet.
Then you put that paper wallet in your safe.  And make a copy and put it in another safe.  Or if the paper wallet was created using a BIP38 passphrase, you would wallpaper the city with your paper wallet.

Is this actually true?  We can see every transaction in a block, does someone have a way to just make a histogram of all 2700 transactions in the block and report what their sat/B tx fee was?
This last block was 1,039,977 bytes with 2701 tx (so average size is 385 byes). Total mining fees were 315,613,269 satoshi.  So average sat/B was (315.6M / 1.04M) = 303 sat/B.  Yes?  That looks about right, since there are around 2000 transactions in the mempool that are in the 300+ range.
Doesn't seem like there could be a whole lot of 6 sat/B txs included.  If there were, they would need a one-for-one 600 sat/B tx for it to average out.  And there's barely a couple dozen transactions in the mempool that are over 500 sat/B right now.
I think there's something else going on here.  Or am I way off somehow?

You don't really have to manually calculate your transaction size, since you set the fee rate in sat/B and your wallet will calculate the cost.  If you are interested in what the size is, your app my show you, or you can do the calculation.  Like if you pick 102 sat/B and it gives you a fee of 0.00012354 (12354 satoshis), then your transaction was 121 bytes.
If you want to know after you have sent the transaction, you can look it up on a block explorer.  Like this:
Size is 275 bytes, Fees was 0.00123360 BTC, and fee per byte was 480 sat/B.   (That was a really high fee.)

Yes, you get your forked coins.  If you had a bitcoin balance on Coinbase on August 1st, you receive BCH in your BCH wallet.
I never held bitcoin on Coinbase for very long, but my standing $100 buy was set for the 25th of every month.  So apparently I had $100 worth of bitcoin on Coinbase, because I logged in to find 0.04077xxx BCH in a wallet.   Sure enough, looking back through my transactions I see a transfer out of 0.04077xxx bitcoin on August 8th.

Yes, no miner fee.  GDAX pays the bitcoin network miner fee when you withdraw BTC from GDAX to your external (phone, hardware, whatever) wallet.
As for your second question, I do not understand it.  Is "the trade" referring to the 10 USD to 0.00060507 BTC trade on the exchange?  No, that wouldn't "utilize your personal private keys" (whatever that means).  It would remove 10 USD from your GDAX USD Wallet Account balance (which you transferred in from your bank ~4 days or more prior) and deposit 0.00060507 BTC into your GDAX BTC Wallet Account.  You would then initiate a withdraw of that BTC out to your phone / hardware wallet where your personal private keys are.  GDAX will pay the miner fee when you do this.

You can look at a site like this one:  
Every time the graph peak drops, that's a block confirming a bunch of transactions.  You can see which band the dip cuts into.  If you want to get into next block, you will need to pick one in that band.
Right now the grey band is the one getting cut into, which is the 100-140 satoshi/Byte range.   So if you picked 140 sat/B you are pretty much guaranteed to get into the next block.   140 sat/Byte, with a standard transaction size of around 250 bytes, would be 35,000 satoshi, or 0.000 350 00 Bitcoin, or around $7 USD.
If you zoom out two 2 days, you can see the mempool was clearing down into the that yellow 50-70 band.  If you have a low priority transaction and don't care if it takes a while to clear, you could put in a 70 sat/B tx.   That would be closer to $3.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:00:13
You pay ± 0.5% "spread" on the market price by using Coinbase rather than futzing with an exchange.
On the $11,700 market price on GDAX, that means you can buy on Coinbase for $11,758.50 and sell for $11,641.50
You then also pay a 1.5% fee on top of that.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:39:14
I mean, but it's not.  Multiplying on the top side changes all relationships to Bitcoin.  Dividing it more does not.
Lets say you want to make USD micro transactions a thing.  You want Tenths of a penny payments to be possible.   So you could 1) add a new coin that is a tenth of a penny (further divide the dollar) or 2) keep a penny as the smallest unit and just make everything worth 10 times as much.
Practical effect of 1) A car is worth $24,000, milk is $2.00 per gallon, gas is $3.00 per gallon, one Japanese Yen is $112, and a micro transaction to buy an extra turn on Candy Crush is $0.002 dollars.
Nothing changes, at all, except you now have access to a smaller unit.
Option 2.  Change All The Things!   Cars are now $240,000.  The Yen is now $1120.  Your turn in Candy Crush is now 2 Cents.
Why would you change EVERYTHING when you can just add a digit?  
If you multiplied everything in Bitcoin by 10 or 100, you'd need to change the mining algorithms for rewards, how the numbers are stored on the blockchain.  What's the effect on old addresses?  
No, why tear up everything?  Add a 0 to the decimal.

This is exactly what I'm doing.  And pay tax when I sell **to fiat**.

I am treating NONE of that as a taxable event.  (looking at the alt coin trade as a like-kind)
Eventually, if/when I sell that 5 bitcoin in two years, I will consider them as a basis of zero and pay long term capital gains tax on the full amount.

And thus why you should not take tax advice from the internet...
He says "What if you buy $5000 worth and withdraw $5000."  I took his question to mean "I'm pulling out my initial investment after a price increase and retaining the leftover BTC."   Unless you bought 1 Bitcoin for $5000 and then sold 1 Bitcoin for $5000, the answer is that you may owe tax.
Here is an example:
Buy $1000 @ $4650 per BTC, 0.21505376 BTC
Price of bitcoin goes up to $11350 per BTC and you want to sell $1000 worth (to recoup your initial investment). So you are going to sell 0.08810573 BTC.
Here is how the taxes would work. You'd have to split your original buy into two lines, one to match how much you sold, and one for how much you have left over.
Sell 0.08810573 BTC for $1000, which was originally worth $409.69 (aka the Basis)
Keep 0.12694803 BTC which was originally worth $590.31 (aka the Basis). (In the future when you sell this BTC, you would use $590.31 as your cost basis).
So you sold 0.088... BTC that had a basis of $409.69, for $1000. So you had capital gains of $590.31. This is what you would owe taxes on.

This is something you should have 100% ironed out before the work happened.  It sounds like you did not discuss it, and you don't have a contract.
Therefore, I feel like the most fair option is that payment is due in the agreed terms ($3000 in BTC) when the service was provided, i.e. "Payment is due when service is rendered."  You said that was November 27th.
There's a GDAX chart for the whole day of November 27th.  Price was between $9450 and $9800.
This is further backed by his message, which barring anything else could be considered an informal invoice, where he pegs the price as $9500 per bitcoin, so $3000 is 0.315 BTC.
You owe him 0.315 BTC.
He should not be shorted just because you delayed payment of the invoice.  And the hypothetical of "well if it was the other way it would be different" is irrelevant.  
(Also, if he's a "friend" who's doing work for you, why are you fucking around over $100.  Give him the 0.315 BTC that he is due.)

You would only create 1 address from 1 public key.  Is it *technically* possible for two different public keys to hash to the same address, but SUPER unlikely to the point of being virtually impossible.
Look at the latest block that was mined.  If you scroll down a little you'll see a ton of strings that all start with the number 1 (and some of them 3).  Those are ALL addresses.  These thousands of lines in the blockchain ledger.   Some of them contain bitcoin.  Some of don't.  Bitcoin travels in and out of these addresses. 
 Lets take one as an example:
We are looking at 1PrkNZ... this is an address.  Someone could send bitcoin to this address.  Someone, somewhere, knows the private key that goes with the public key that created this address; that person is the owner of this address and has the ability to sign a transaction to send its contents somewhere else.
Looking at the linked page, you can see at the top Total Received 33.42215686 BTC and Final Balance is 0 BTC.   So there is currently no bitcoin in this address.  We look below (very bottom) and we can see that the 33.4x BTC was transferred in to this address from 1572nAF... on December 4th.   And then above that we can see that 1PrkNZ... (the address we are looking at) sent 32.82857031 BTC to address 1FshjgK... and 0.59290855 BTC to address 15gFU4b...
Now see that last address, the 15gFU4b...?  It has a green "Unspent" next to it.  If we click on that and go to that public key / address page, at the top we can see there have been 5 transaction, this address has had 3.39873871 BTC sent to it, and it currently has a Final Balance of 0.59290855 BTC.
So this address has bitcoin in it.  Whoever owns (read: has the private key for) this address has access to send that 0.5929 BTC to someone. 
And presumably this address is part of a wallet, so this 0.5929 BTC can be bundled with other address to send 0.8 BTC, or 1.4 BTC, or some greater amount than just the 0.5929.  You can see that if you scroll down a little bit.  See that huge list of addresses?  A bunch of small amounts of BTC were all bundled together and send 1KBVwz6... a total of 100 BTC.

I wouldn't personally worry about taxes on this type of transaction.
The question comes down to the price of exchange and who's money you are using.  Call your buddy Ken.
1) Ken says he will send you $8k to buy bitcoin.  He wants you to buy bitcoin right now at $8k (using your USD) at the current price.  Then when his $8k shows up in your account, you can send him that BTC.
2) Ken says he will send you $8k to buy bitcoin.  He says "Wait until the money arrives, then you can put it on GDAX and buy however much you can."  So he's buying $8k at whatever the future price is.  Then you can send him that BTC.
3) Ken says he will send you $8k to buy bitcoin.  You can sell him $8k worth of your current bitcoin (at market price right now) and send him the BTC after the $8k arrives.  You would then hold on to that $8k USD.  
4) Ken says he will send you $8k to buy bitcoin.  You can sell him $8k worth of your current bitcoin as soon as his $8k arrives, so future price.  You would then hold on to that $8k USD.  
Number 1 locks in the current price, but requires you to have cash liquid to do the buy.  Number 2 uses Ken's money, but at the risk (may be good, or bad) of buying at a future price.  Number 3 locks in current price and you'll get your $8k assuming you trust him.   Number 4 is "Delivery Upon Payment" option that executes the trade once cash is in hand.  All up to you.
Again, I wouldn't worry about taxes here personally.

Right now all your BTC live in addresses that start with a 1.  These are the old, non-SegWit addresses.   The new address will start with a 3, which is a SegWit address.
There's no pro to keeping BTC in a legacy address.  When you eventually spend from it there would be more fees than if they were in a SegWit address.
So personally I would wait until low-fee confirmations are going through and send all your non-SegWit addressed BTC to your new address with a cheap fee.  It will confirm in a couple hours.  Now any future spends will be from the lower-cost SegWit account.
If you don't do this, then in the future when you want to send BTC, it would be from an old address and you might not necessarily have a good fee situation at the time, and you might want to have a fast confirmation, so you'll pay a higher fee.
Might as well just get it all into a SegWit account now.

Can you tell us what you think the term "intrinsic value" means?  When I look it up, I see things like:
*The intrinsic value is the actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value including all aspects of the business, in terms of both tangible and intangible factors.*
and 
*In commodity money, intrinsic value can be partially or entirely due to the desirable features of the object as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Examples of such features include divisibility; easily and securely storable and transportable; scarcity; and difficulty to counterfeit. When objects come to be used as a medium of exchange they lower the high transaction costs associated with barter and other in-kind transactions.*
Intrinsic Value is the value of something due to the nature of what it is.  Bitcoin is a globally distributed secure immutable ledger.  That aspect of the bitcoin system has value, it's what gives bitcoin its value.
The Extrinsic Value of bitcoin is currently about $14,000 USD.  It has this Extrinsic Value, the USD value we place upon it, due (in part) to its Intrinsic Value.

Well, the idea is that there **won't** be anyone left holding the bag.  That bitcoin isn't going away, that adoption will just keep ramping up and the value won't evaporate.
Unless something catastrophic and completely unexpected happens, the fundamentals of bitcoin will hold up.
It all depends on what your goals are.  Some people have a stack from years and years of buying, and I'd like to think those people are slowly bleeding off their holdings to realize some gains.  Some people got in later, dollar cost averaging month to month and haven't really "hit it big" yet, so they'll just keep hodling.  And even more people are just now jumping on board.  Some people day trade.  Some people are all-in and get paid in bitcoin and try and use it exclusively.  There's room for all of it, I think.

Right.  A market buy order on GDAX is 0.25% fee.  Compared to a Buy It Now purchase on Coinbase which will be a total of 2% fee (0.5% above market price, +1.5%).
And like you said, putting in a limit order would be free.
And withdrawing BTC from GDAX is free (i.e. GDAX will pay the miner fee on the transfer), regardless of where you buy it.  So even if you do buy on Coinbase because it's convenient, transfer it over to GDAX before you transfer it out to your wallet.

The linked article is not about getting USD instantly into Coinbase.  ACH will always take 4 days to get deposited.  The "instant USD" you were seeing is the Coinbase equivalent of "Buy It Now" button.  When you say BUY! on Coinbase it will lock in the price, start the ACH from the bank, and you get access to your BTC in about a week.  This price lockin will cost you 0.5% above market price (so if it's trading at $10,000 per BTC, your buy it now price will be $10,050 per BTC), plus you pay 1.5% fee.
The article is about avoiding fees.  Instead of clicking Buy It Now, you yourself initiate a USD deposit to Coinbase.  This will take about 4 days to show up in your USD wallet.  Then you can go to GDAX, the exchange, and move the money from the Coinbase USD wallet into the GDAX wallet.  This is a free and instant transfer since GDAX and Coinbase are the same company / linked systems.  Once the USD is on GDAX you can follow the directions in the article to initiate a limit order, which has no fees, and you'll be able to get actual market price.
Once you buy your Bitcoin you can leave it in GDAX or transfer it back to Coinbase (if you are leaving your BTC on the exchange for some reason).  OR you can withdraw from GDAX to your wallet, and GDAX will pay the miner fee for you.   If you ever transfer BTC out of Coinbase you pay the miner fee, so always initiate a BTC withdrawl from the GDAX side.

Comparison of Coinbase "Buy It Now" to GDAX exchange price:
You'll pay about 2% more to use the lock-in Buy It Now option through Coinbase.  The alternative is to initiate your own bank transfer to load money into your Coinbase (or GDAX) account first, then use that money (4 days later when it shows up in your account) on GDAX to put in a limit order, which will have no fees.  Then transfer the BTC out of GDAX, and GDAX will pay the miner fee.  
If you do buy from Coinbase, you should still transfer the BTC to GDAX before transferring it out.  BTC sent from Coinbase to GDAX is free and instant.

This can be done on GDAX.  You can put it in as a Stop Loss order, which will sell off your bitcoin at market price as soon as the dollar amount is reached.  (e.g. a Stop Loss of 10 BTC at $8000.  Once $8000 is hit, GDAX would place a Market Order to Sell 10 BTC.  Your BTC would be sold out to whoever was currently on the order books.  [Effect of a Stop Loss market order](
You can also put it in as a Limit order, which will sell off your bitcoin at $8000 as long as there are people buying at that price point.  It would show up as a line in the order book.
(I see you are opting for a buy high, sell low strategy.   Good luck out there, sir.)

Assuming you mean blockchain / transaction scaling, subdividing a satoshi wouldn't do anything.
Reducing block time would be the same effect as increasing the block size.  If we mined every 5 minutes instead of 10 minutes, it would be the same as increasing block size from 1 MB to 2 MB.  Which is not (in many's opinion) a viable scaling option (mainly the impact on overall size of the blockchain, and that a mere doubling is a super short-term stop gap solution).
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:08:12
On average, about 60 minutes after you make it on the blockchain.  Blocks are mined on average every 10 minutes.   The average of the last 26 blocks was 9.5 minutes, though some were 5,6,7 and others were 22,25,26.
The big "time" question is when you get your first confirmation.  Once you actually get into a block, the confirmations will come every roughly 10 minutes.  But getting on the block depends on what transaction fee you use.  Use too low of a fee and you might get passed by for a few blocks.

Sell one every time the price goes up 20%.  Buy one every time the price goes down 20%.  Every time a buy or sell occurs, re-strike that as the baseline and find new ± 20% values.

If it hits $18,650, then next sell is at $22,380 and next buy would be $14,920.

Whenever you send bitcoin from one address to another there is a miner fee.
If your BTC is in Coinbase and you send it out to your hardware wallet, you will pay the miner fee.  And Coinbase's miner fees can be pretty high because they don't use SegWit and they don't use the minimum amount of fee necessary (or let you select a fee).
For example, on November 2nd I sent some BTC:
Congratulations! You have successfully sent 0.0175xxx BTC (worth $120.14 USD) to 1Mc.................D using Coinbase. To facilitate this transaction, you paid 0.00054xxx BTC (worth $3.73 USD) in network fees.
If I go look up that transaction, Coinbase made me pay 240.8 satoshis per Byte for the transaction.  And if I look at the Mempool on November 2nd, it looks like I could have gotten away with 20-30 or 30-50 sat/B fees (since I was just moving off of Coinbase to hardware and didn't need my transaction to go through in 10 minutes).   So Coinbase made me pay $3.73 when $0.35 would have been fine.
  (If you are new then you probably haven't seen this.  The "mempool" is the collection of transactions that have been broadcast out to all the miners, but not yet included in the blockchain.  The mempool is the group of transactions that miners select from while creating their block.   The color bands are the different transaction fees people have selected when broadcasting.  Miners will give priority to transactions with higher fees.   That's why you can see some of the lower color bands "stacking up" and not getting cleared, because there are higher priority transactions above them that are getting cleared first.   If you want your transaction to be entered into the next block (sometime in the next 10 minutes), you would want to use a transaction fee that will put you at the top of the list.  Network congestion varies throughout the day / week / month depending on what's going on.  You can check on the Mempool at any time through a website like 
But GDAX, if you withdraw BTC through GDAX then they pay the miner fee.  If I withdraw 1 BTC I get my full 1 BTC, not 0.99945 BTC after miner fee.

There was a 3 minute moment when BCH/USD trading turned on and some weird trading happened with whatever was on the (up until that moment frozen) order book.  Then everything froze again, but the last trade was apparently at $9500 so that's the number that stuck.
There's no market manipulation, trading wasn't supposed to even be occurring yet.   $9500 was never a "real" price.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:34:15
The recent article that said "Bitcoin breaks $12,000!!!!" when GDAX is still sitting at $11,800 like it has all day.   They were using a weighted average from CoinMarketCap.  But that incorporates Koreon exchanges that have been at the equivalent of $13,000 USD for days.  And there's no arbitrage to even that out.
So what is the "real" price?  There is no real price, like you've already deduced.  It's like the price for a gallon of milk, it depends on what store you go to.

You are only ever waiting on the first block.   Once your transaction makes it into a block, that's where it lives forever.  "Confirmations" are "Number Of Blocks Since **MY** Block."  The more blocks that get stacked on top of your completed block is more confidence that your block will never be reversed.
Here, I drew a picture:

0.001 000 00 = 1 mBTC = 1 millibitcoin
0.000 001 00 = 1 µBTC = 1 microbitcoin (some people call this a "bit")
0.000 000 01 = 10 nBTC = 10 nanobitcoin - 1 satoshi (nobody really uses the term nanobitcoin)

I always tried to explain it using ledger analogy, but I saw a good explanation yesterday.
Think about Facebook.  Facebook has a ton of history in every account.  Posts, comments, pictures, etc.  Now imagine Tom from Myspace came back on the scene and said "Damn, I really like how Facebook runs, but I think I can make it better.  But I don't want to start from scratch, I just want to tweak it."
So Tom takes a snapshot of Facebook, as it exists on August 1st 2017.  Every single post, comment, picture, link, share.  Everything, the whole history.  He takes a snapshot and calls it MyspaceBook.  
Now everyone who has been using Facebook just keeps going along using Facebook.  Adding comments, adding pictures, sending shared posts to each other, creating new history past August 1st.  And some people really like MyspaceBook a bit better, so they go over to the copy and start adding comments over there.  If you went over to MyspaceBook.com you would see an exact copy of everything in your account on August 1st.  If you didn't have an account on August 1st, you wouldn't see anything on MyspaceBook because you had nothing to copy.
That's the hard fork.  Now shifting that to the blockchain ledger (a list of accounts and transactions).  Bcash took a snapshot of the complete Bitcoin Ledger as it existed on August 1st.   Now there are Bcash tokens over on the Bcash blockchain, and there's still bitcoin tokens over on the Bitcoin blockchain.
On August 1st, when the fork happened, the only Bcash tokens in existence were the ones from the copied blockchain.  After August 1st, new Bcash tokens are mined on their blockchain using their algorithm.

It doesn't look like there was any additional fee, it's just the market spread.   He put in $20, paid $7286.93/BTC, and got 0.00274464.

Gemini is an exchange, so you'd need to compare it to GDAX, so Gemini does not have lower fees than GDAX.

The general thought is that once Bitcoin spreads a bit more we wouldn't need dedicated mining rigs to do the work.  Imagine if every ATM in existence was a mini bitcoin miner that was sitting there confirming transactions while waiting for people to use it.  
It's still a long way off.  We hit the 19 Million BTC mark in 2022, which will be 90% of all bitcoins.  (It tapers off a lot.  21 Million won't be until 2140).   I figure by 2022 there will be a robust solution to keep mining going regardless of the rewards from the coinbase reward and fees.

No one says OP is a rich asshole for the boat.
Lets try another scenario, maybe you people will understand.
You bought economy seats on an airline.  There are 100 people all looking to board the plane.  You are all equals.
The airline offers an upgrade service for priority boarding.  You can pay $15 to skip the line.   That's fine, you can elect to do this, no problems here.
Next time you fly with a different airline.  They do not offer an update for priority boarding.  You go up to the desk and slip the gate agent $20 to skip the line.   They let you board first.
This second situation is what OP's boat story is.   There was no mechanism to pay for priory service.  He bribes the person to allow him first access.   That is what some people are having issues with.

Since one should avoid dictionary words, and random symbols and characters are difficult to remember and would have to be written, here's what I do.
I've played a variety of fantasy games in the past.  The type of games that people get to make up character names.  These character names are often completely unique and not really words, and are essentially unknown.
So lets say I had a friend John who's character was Xartiavin.  I've played with John (Xartiavin) for many years.  My other friend is Mary and her character was Parfitha.   So maybe I would make my passphrase XartiavinParfitha01121976.  Then, right there on the paper wallet, I can write down JohnMaryBDAY.  I then know my passphrase is John's Character, Mary's Character, and my full birthdate.
Or something like SchoolSchoolSchoolStreetStreetStreetBirthday could be your passphrase hint and would indicate the three schools you went to and the three streets you lived on.  It's secure and you wouldn't have to write down your actual passphrase.

There's way too many people involved, way too many with a vested interest in this going somewhere.  It all seems very solid.  There's a lot of people like me who "got in" and are just waiting, but there's so much more going on with bitcoin that you can just ignore the little turd cling-ons like me.
2) Eventually I'd like to "cash out" some, but on the other hand I have a hard time cashing out when it's on the up swing.  So I'll probably just leave it there until something bonkers happens, maybe pull out a bit to pay off my house if that ever happens.  Hard to say.

It's pretty straight forward. But OP presents the question, and then says the answer is "4 bitcoin worth $2364 ( current price) that were purchased for less than $2364 total."
It's just not true.
If you want to make a post about something, no matter what the topic (in this case bitcoin and dollar cost averaging) then just be truthful about it.

Talking about mining is second or third level explanation I feel.   The best way to start is to talk about the ledger.  Equate it to a bank's ledger.  
A bank doesn't actually store piles of dollar bills that are assigned to you.  They just have a big ledger, a list of values and transactions.  If I want to send $400 to my mom with my bank, they just reduce my number by $400 and increase hers by $400, and everyone trusts that I had $400 and she now has $400 because we trust the bank.
Bitcoin is the exact same thing, except there's no central bank to trust.  The Bitcoin Blockchain (the ledger) is secure and trusted because of cryptography (math).  The Bitcoin ledger is public and everyone in the network verifies it with computing power (mining), so this prevents someone else from coming in and changing something; everyone else would notice.

As far as passphrase, writing down "hints" might be good.   Even if the hint is StreetStreetStreet, that should be enough to remind you that your passphrase is the three street names that used to live, so GlendaleFoxwoodElm.

Because in my example I said I was buying 5 BTC  5 BTC and 5 BTC   If the price goes up to $1100 and I decide to sell 3 of my 15 BTC, I could claim that I am selling 3 of the $900 coins for $200 profit each.   I would still have five $500 coins, five $700 coins, and two $900 coins.

It's a fact that crime rates are higher in cities with greater population / density.  Australia has 10 cities with over 250k people in it.  The US has over 75.  
The war on drugs and our neighbor to the south is a direct causal factor to crime in the US.  This ties into our racial history, our racial segregation (blacks centralized in those large cities), which results in the fact that the black population (13% of the overall population) results in 56% of the murders, 93% of which are black-on-black killings.
And NONE of this is related to the tool used in committing this crimes.  Guns don't CAUSE crime.  In the United States, if we banned all guns tomorrow, the crime would all still occur.  And it would still occur with firearms, and it would be an increase in knife / other instruments.  And persons intent on mass murder would resort to bombs or fire.
Crime is a social issue.  Not a gun issue.  There are around 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in the US every year.  There are over 300 million firearms in the US.  So over 99.9% of firearms are NOT used in crime every year.  My firearms have never killed anyone; why shouldn't I be allowed to have them?  And thankfully the 2nd Amendment ensures that right.

Only if the bank publishes account numbers and balances and transactions only.  You can't put names to these addresses.  Give me all of the addresses that the Winklevoss guys control.   Or all the addresses that -I- control.  And even if you did, and I send 10 BTC from one of my known addresses to a brand new different address, you have no idea whose that is.  A company?  A friend?  Another one I control?  And if you did try and figure it all out, does it really matter that you think you know how much BTC I have control over?

As much as bitcoiners immediately scoff in disgust at this idea, it only takes a moment of thought to realize this is a legit psychological effect, as well as a practical benefit.  The psychological effect is just like you said, both the "too expensive to buy" and the disheartening "I only have 0.1 bitcoin, that's like nothing!"  But having 100 uBTC is something tangible, significant. 
The practical benefit is that dealing with decimals is not super intuitive for people.   Like it or not, subtracting 0.00011 from 0.002357 is daunting for a LOT of people.  You can point and laugh all you want, but it's still true.  Counting how many leading zeros, worrying about decimals moving...  but subtracting $110 from $2357 is trivial.

Formatted so it's actually readable.
Sid Meier’s Civilization has been one of the most successful and popular strategy games since it first started back in the early 90s. But Sid Meier has lent his name (and presumably his talents) to some other titles as well. 
You can grab the current bundle for any donation of $1 or more, and that will get you five titles: 
* Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete (~90%, September 2004)
* Sid Meier’s Civilization IV: The Complete Edition (~91%, May 2009)
* Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol (71%, August 2013)
* Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies (59%, November 2013)
* Sid Meier’s Railroads! (77%, October 2006)
The first two in the list include several DLC/expansion packs along with the core game, and if you haven’t ever played Civ3 or Civ4, prepare to lose a few weeks of your life if you’re not careful. 
Paying more than the average (currently $8.62 and rising) will you get two more Civilization games: 
* Sid Meier’s Civilization V (90%, September 2010) 
* Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Gods and Kings DLC (80%, June 2012)
 As the latest additions to the Civilization franchise, beating the average to get Civ5 is definitely recommended. 
And finally, as an added twist there’s an eighth title available, if you pay more than $15: 
* Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World (85%, June 2013)
Purchased separately on Steam right now, the eight titles would carry a combined price tag of nearly $145, so even if you “splurge” for the $15 pack you’re getting an awesome 90% off deal.

A couple comments / concerns with your website and ordering.
I went to order a Red, Blue, and Black card, each with the Bitcoin logo on the back.  The Red and Blue both showed up correctly in the Checkout with Bitcoin listed, but the Black one showed Blank.  I went back several times, tried selecting both Blank and Bitcoin options, but each time it went to Checkout as Blank.
Secondly, you really need to add a screen confirming the Bitcoin address information.  I entered it on the order screens, but the Checkout just showed the color / description of the cards, and NOT my actual Bitcoin addresses you would be engraving.  I would like (née demand) a screen to review that address information is correct before I submit the order.
Third, if / when you do redesign your layout, would it be possible to include a Text Field?  Even so I could just add a label like "Cold Storage 1" or maybe a password reminder.  I understand if you don't want to do this, for fear of people herp derping and telling you to put their actual passphrase on the card.  [I can always just make a sticker and put it on the back of the card, but a text field engraved would be nice.]
As soon as these concerns, mainly number 2, are resolved, I'll be putting in an order.  Thanks!

System will include encrypted communication message system. Mycelium will take a 0.5% cut, possibly lower. Very fast (90 secs+) high confidence trading feature, where Mycelium tracks your transaction propagation through network - better than waiting for multi 10 min block confirmation times.

* &gt; Bitcoin transaction speed
* &gt; [Avg] Bitcoin transaction time: 1 minute
* &gt; [Avg] Fiat transaction time: 8 days = 11520 minutes.
* &gt; Percent difference: 199.97, or 200%.
Um.  What?  100% faster would be 1 minute compared to 2 minutes.  200% faster would be 1 minute compared to 3 minutes.  Initial Number * (1 + xxx%) = New Number.  So you are saying that BTC was 1151900% faster.

It's called the coinbase (not to be confused with Coinbase the company).  When a block is mined, the Bitcoin system adds a coinbase transfer to the miner who mined the block.  The coinbase transaction creates the reward (currently 25 BTC) and sends it to the successful miner's address.
If you look at [a Block]( you will see the first item on the list says "No Inputs (Newly Generated Coins)" with the 25 BTC (and fees) on it.

But if you believe the muckity mucks over at bitcointalk.org, they are estimating only 300,000 people have 1 BTC or more.  Even if all those people are in the US, that's less than 0.1% of the population.
Now imagine that Bitcoin adoption gets to the level that Paypal is now.  [Paypal user stats.]( That's what Bitcoin will be for a lot of people, a secure, efficient, and PRIVATE way to buy things online.  The same things talked about on the Paypal website will apply to Bitcoin.  And Paypal is claiming to have 2.6M top customers buy things 100 times per year and spend over $4000 per year.  And 110M total accounts.
What is the price of BTC that would support even this level of commerce?

This bet doesn't make any sense.   If the "I support Stocks" guy wins, presumably because BTC becomes worthless, he gets back his share of stock and 300 (worthless) bitcoins.  But if the "I support Bitcoin" guy wins, he gets 300 bitcoin (worth $200k+?) and the share of stock (worth $200k+).
So, where's the EV for the stock guy?  If he wins he gets nothing back monetarily, just a "Haha I told you" victory?
Unless the bettor thinks that bitcoin is going to be in the $600-800 range a year from now and still be closely comparable to the BRK.A stock and actually make this a close race?  And I wouldn't take THAT bet at all.   If bitcoin is still in the $600-800 range a year from now, I'll eat my hat.  I'll either be floored (unlikely in my eyes) or another rung up the step-function of price we've been seeing.  I don't see this Bitcoin experiment being stagnant for a year.

Businesses need to start accepting bitcoin before customers can spend it.  But the business can't spend their bitcoin to pay for rent or utilities or wages, so they must switch to fiat.

People consider this a problem because they view it in the light of traditional fiat.   The difference is that the wealth of the small number of individuals is not getting larger, as a percentage of the whole.  With bitcoin the rich do not get richer like they do with fiat.  Those holders must invest that bitcoin in tangible productive endeavors, which is a net benefit to society.


Wow, I disagree with every single one of your points.  Power consumption and somehow "the rich will control mining" is a baseless position to hold when speaking about the future.  Transaction limit is easily updated, irreversibly is a positive and not a a negative, and high volatility is a short-term problem.

You wouldn't.
However, I'm going to lunch at the local Deli that offers a 10% discount for bitcoin purchases.  I'd use bitcoin.   I want to buy a Humble Bundle online for $4.  I can very easily use bitcoin for that and would.  I want to send money back to my family back in Europe / Middle East / Across-the-world and don't want to blow 20% or whatever on fees and cuts and bank exchanges.  I'd use bitcoin.  I want to tip my favorite Youtuber $1.  I'd love to use bitcoin for that.

1) They get out the tablet and go to the app.
2) They type in the order number off the ticket (for their records purposes I assume)
3) They type in the dollar amount of the ticket
4) A QR code appears (it pulls current BTC/$ from the payment processor and shows BTC amount owed)
5) I scan the QR with my phone's wallet app.
6) My wallet app shows the bitcoin amount requested, and shows the 0.0001 miner fee.  Hit "accept."
7) On my phone, type in pin number to confirm transfer
8) My phone instantly pops up with "Sending 0.01254 BTC," and the deli's tablet shows "Receiving 0.01254 BTC."
9) I say thanks and walk out.
Zero confirmation needed.  After less than 10 minutes a block will be mined and the transaction will fully complete and be confirmed.

That's the problem with the question as posed.  He is talking about mining coins.

I feel like this is the best answer.  Unlike fractional reserve fiat deflation, with Bitcoin the deflation (increase in the currency's value) correlates with an INCREASE in the Bitcoin economy.   Deflation in the traditional sense occurs because it's all based on debt.

I think some here might be misunderstanding the video and its relevance to Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is both the paper money AND the gold.  In the adaptation sense, Bitcoin is struggling for approval just like the paper money in the video; we are all Marco Polo here, trying to explain this new currency's worth and advantages.  But on the other hand, the Venetians are right to claim that gold is better, that it speaks and has value and doesn't depend on Trust.  Bitcoin is this gold, trying to wrestle control back AWAY from paper money.
So, to accurately turn this video to a literal display of Bitcoin's situation, you would need the Venetians arguing for paper money because it is the current standard, and Marco Polo coming in with New Electronic Gold and trying to display how it has value because of what it represents and how easy it is to transfer.

Just to clarify here slightly; an unconfirmed transaction -has- been checked to see if it's a legitimate spend, insofar as it has it has already verified that funds are available in the source account.   If I try and send BTC out of a wallet with 0 balance the transaction will not get put in the "holding pool" of transactions on the blockchain, it will just get declined.
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:40:29
First, don't take this response as any type of prediction, just throwing numbers around.
Imagine that bitcoin does become a global means of exchange.  This would mean that some decent percentage of the population would need access to (own) some amount of bitcoin.
But what amount of bitcoin?  That's where the 21 million bitcoins come in.  If there's 21 million bitcoins, and there are.... 2 billion people interested in using them for commerce (in this hypothetical).  By no means does the distribution need to be even, but if it WERE even that would leave an average of 0.0105 bitcoins per person.  Distribution of wealth being what it is, some will certainly have more and some will have far less.
So lets say a random plebeian would own a 10th of their "share" of bitcoin, or 0.001 bitcoins.  This amount would need to represent a substantial amount of value in order to be used to conduct commerce.     Lets even completely lowball this and say it's $1000 worth of value.  In this future world, an "average" pleb might own $1000 worth of bitcoin (like someone might own $1000 worth of gold or silver or fiat).  So that's 0.001 BTC worth $1000, so 1 BTC would be valued at $1,000,000.
Again, I'm not saying 1 BTC is going to be worth a million dollars.  I'm saying that there is a circumstance where bitcoin becomes a ubiquitous store of value globally and due to there only being 21 million bitcoins in existence, that necessitates an extremely high value.  Even if you assume people only would own $100 worth of bitcoin and there's only 1 billion people who are interested in using bitcoin, that would still require $50,000 per BTC value to cover that amount.

Is this a question of what he meant, or what his words actually said.  Now it's quite possible his "run out of liquidity" is a masked double-speak for insolvent, but the words itself don't mean that.   
Personally, I would buy some more bitcoin right now, but I have run out of liquidity (no cash available).   This is different than being in debt with no way to pay (insolvent).

As for quality, the face of the black one had a bit of imperfection on the bitcoin logo.
The way I would describe it is if you were to put a sticker on something but had a bubble under the sticker.  Like a vinyl cling-on to a window, with a bubble.  Of course there really isn't a bubble of any sort on the card, but that's what it looked like.

A valid license is a good idea since you can only so a personal sale intra-state.  Ensuring this is pretty much the only legal onus placed on the seller, other than the fact that they can not knowingly sell to a prohibited person.  (i.e. if a guy walks up smoking a joint, you can't sell to him.  If he says "thanks for the gun man, I wouldn't be able to buy from an FFL / pass a background check", you can't sell to him.

Why don't you like it?  This is what makes their "confidence" rating work.  The problem with zero-confirmation transactions is that your transaction has to propagate across the network in order to get mined, and prevent a double-spend.
Think of it this way.  Imagine you are sitting by a huge lake (which represents the Bitcoin network).  Making a transaction (buying lunch with BTC for example) is like dropping a stone right in front of you into the lake and making a ripple.  It takes time for that transaction to make it across the network.  But imagine Mycelium's servers as being 10,000 people spread all around the lake.  When you make a transaction (sell BTC to someone on their service) it's like handing each one of those people your transaction and they all throw it in the lake at the same time; thousands of ripples.   Instead of a single point where your transaction enters the Bitcoin network, now it's being entered all over the place, ensuring that a shit-ton of nodes have seen your transaction and is thus likely to be put into the next block and not be double spent.

Take a look at this blog post.  
It starts out very clearly showing what bitcoin is compared to current banks.  If you have an account in a bank that has $2000 in it, there isn't ACTUALLY $2000 in paper sitting in a pile with your name next to it.  That $2000 is a number on a computer system that the bank controls.  If you do an electronic fund transfer to a different account, the bank controlled system adjusts your number down and the other account's number up.  This all works because the bank's system is secure and everyone trusts it.  You as a person can not go in and modify your numbers (lie, steal money).
It's the same thing with Bitcoin.  Because the ledger is public, and EVERYONE knows how much is in EVERY address, it is secure and trusted.  You can't just go change your account balance because everyone else would disagree.  The difference is that it is cryptographically secure and trusted, instead of having a third party involved.
tl:dr- read the blog I linked.  It's very good at laying out how it works.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:42:45


I suppose it's true, but instant buy could easily change that and increase the people who are spending BTC.  The whole idea is that supporter of bitcoin would prefer to do transactions in BTC and then replace the spent BTC.  Instant buys is the best way to do that.  I want to spend $500.  Buy 0.625 BTC  and then spend it.  Tomorrow I want to spend $600.  Buy 0.71 BTC  and then spend it.
Without instant buy availability, I'd need to hold a sizeable spendable buffer, and place buy orders that will eventually hit my wallet to replenish 5 days later.

The credit card is a backup.  Also, I would presume any charges to the credit card would be considered a cash advance and not a "charge."  I don't know if you are aware of how cash advances work, but they have an APR in the order of 20% or more and the interest starts at the time of the advance  (not after a month of carrying a balance like a normal charge).
In other words, don't try and buy bitcoin on a credit card like this; it will be a cash advance and cost you a whack-ton of money.

It depends on how the QR code is generated.  Super low tech, like just printing off their public address and slapping it on a sign, you would need to calculate how much to send.

I went to the Bronx Deli location in Pontiac on Telegraph today for lunch with a coworker, very excited to pay with bitcoin.  When I asked my waitress, she didn't know what it was, then rattled off the other payment methods ("The four major credit cards, and of course cash.")  A little bit later I asked to see the manager and was told she was up at the cash register if I wanted to go talk to her.
I go up to speak with the young woman behind the counter and asked if she accepted bitcoin.  She beamed and said "Yes we do.  And you'll be the first one to pay here with it!"  She pulled out a piece of paper with a QR code on it, and some other words that I didn't actually read or remember.  Since it was her first time I walked through the process (hell, it was my first time too), so I showed her my Mycelium app, pointed out my QR code ("this here is my address, just like that one there is your address"), showed her where it said 1 BTC ~ $807 USD.  We had to do the math ourselves though.  The bill was $16.80 or close, so I said to just use $19 in order to include a tip.  19/807 = 0.02354399.  So I type 0.2354 and show her where it says "$19" on my phone, then click send (noting the 0.0001BTC mining fee of $0.08).
She was pretty excited and interested, and said she herself had just gotten a wallet. 
Unfortunately I forgot to mention the 20% discount.  Totally slipped my mind while going through the process.
Looks like I'm the 3rd person to send money to that address.  I guess the other two were in Farmington Hills.

Use Mycelium and have it loaded with whatever small amount you normally would; for me I try and keep only a couple hundred dollars worth of BTC on it.  Then you can also carry with you a copy of an BIP38 encrypted paper wallet.   
In Mycelium you can go to "Cold Storage" in the menu.  It will say "You are about to spend from a private key in cold storage.  This could be a private key paper backup or a private key slip from a Bitcoin ATM.  Several formats are supported.   Once the transaction has been sent every trace of the private key will be eraged from memory.  Get private key from:  [QR Code]"
So you hit the QR Code button, scan the QR code on your paper wallet (the encrypted private key side) and then it will ask for your BIP38 passphrase.  Enter it, and after about a minute of it decrypting it will ask you how much you want to send and to which of your Mycelium wallets.
So I bought one of those aluminum Crypto Cards and I carry one in my wallet with like 6 BTC on it.  I'd never walk around with $4000 in cash on me, but I can easily walk around with the card and even if I lost it I have backups at home.  Can't be stolen, and I don't have to worry about having that much BTC in a hot wallet.

And that's what OP was asking.   "Is this completely legal thing that I am doing increase the likelihood I am audited."

I can put one together, I can probably name all the bits and pieces, if you said a word like AGP or SLI I would say "I've heard that word and it has something to do with graphics cards."

So even if dedicated miners quit for some reason in the future, people who depend upon the Bitcoin network will find a way to keep mining in order to support the blockchain.

It's one of those odd things.  Being a person who knows how Bitcoin works, lottery (in an "idea" sense) is a good analogy.  But for someone who doesn't know about Bitcoin, lottery is a poor analog to what's actually going on.

I really like the box and lock analogy.  Let me try and make the analogy more detailed?
Maybe picture a room filled with rows and rows of boxes, each with a Lock on it, and each with a digital display on the front of the box showing how much is inside the box.   The Lock+Box+Display would be equivalent to the Public Key.  Everyone knows where it is (the number's address / location) and everyone knows what is in it (the digital display).  Every single Bitcoin address is in this room.
In order to open a box you need the Private Key that corresponds to the Public Address; this is how you prove that you own that box.  Now, every box has a "slot" in the top where you can deposit (send) money, and all you need to know is the Public Address.  The digital counter on the front of all the boxes are all connected and will add and subtract whenever BTC is moved from one box to another.  And since all of this is public knowledge, there's no such thing as creating fake money or moving money that you don't have.
Now for a transaction.  Bob walks into the room and pulls out his private key, unlocking one of his boxes.  Inside is 10 BTC.  He pulls out 10 BTC and puts it in his hand, and the digital counter verifies that he had 10 BTC and updates the display to read 0.  Bob, 10 BTC in hand, walks over to Alice's box and deposits 0.2 BTC.  [It should be noted that Bob doesn't necessarily know who Alice is, and Alice's name isn't on her box, just a number.  When setting up this transaction, Alice told Bob "Go deposit the money in box 83732923, that one is mine.]  Alice's box's display increases by 0.2 BTC.  Bob then walks back to his original box (or even a brand new box he just created) and puts his remaining 9.8 BTC into that box.  The system knows he has 9.8 BTC and updates the new box's digital counter with the final 9.8 BTC amount.
This process (unlock box, withdraw all BTC, deposit BTC to receiver and deposit change back to your own address) is a single transaction.  All addresses involved and all amounts transferred are recorded, stored, and broadcast by the system so that EVERYONE knows what happened.

I happened to have another thought about this today.  One of these cards would be a great way to carry "a lot" of money safely.  I had originally purchased with the intention of cold storage, lock it in a safe, and for the coolness factor combined with "it's not going to melt or burn."
But then I was thinking about "What if I am out and needed some money in my Mycelium wallet?"  I have digital backups of the codes so I guess I could try and find the file, copy the address, and paste it into the app, but that seems difficult and cumbersome.
So instead, I'll leave two of the cards I ordered in my safe, but I'll carry the third one in my wallet.  That way I can show people the card and talk about bitcoin, and also have it easily available for me to transfer some coin into a hot wallet if the need should arise.  And while I would never dream of carrying $4000 in fiat on me, I can easily and safely carry 5 BTC on an encrypted card from you guys.  The only danger would be someone who robbed me, found it, and forced me to transfer it (i.e. highly unlikely).
So... cool cool.

The fuzzy logic is so that bots cannot tell if they are banned or not.  For example, for you, it shows 2 points 55 minutes ago (5|3).  You don't -really- have 5 upvotes and 3 downvotes.  It could be 10 and 8, it could be 2 and 0.  All we know is that in aggregate you have +2 votes on your post.  
From the reddit FAQ:
How is a submission's score determined?
A submission's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not "real" numbers, they have been "fuzzed" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are "fuzzed".

You didn't ask for his logic or reason.

You asked "How would you know."  He doesn't know, that's why he's eagerly waiting to see the evidence.  He admits he doesn't actually know, he just says he sincerely doubts.

This guy Sherman is a "cornerback" which means he is on defense and is paired up against a wide receiver (the offense guys that run down the field and then catch a thrown ball).  It's the cornerback's job to stay on the WR and try and intercept the ball, or at least break up the pass by being in the way or tipping the ball before the WR can catch it.  
Near the end of the game last night, the gentleman in question (Sherman the cornerback) made a play in the endzone (the scoring place) by breaking up a pass that was intended for Crabtree.  Sherman jumped up and tipped the ball, which then was deflected and intercepted by one of Sherman's teammates.  This is a turnover, meaning the offense is no longer in possession of the ball and the other team (Sherman's team) now gets to be on offense.
While not -exactly- a game winning play, Sherman's deflection and the subsequent interception prevented Crabtree's team from scoring and essentially ended the game with Sherman's team winning.
Then, in the post-game interview... well, hyped up angry black people.
On a side note, Sherman got hit with an "Unsportsmanlike Conduct" right after the endzone play.  After the play, Sherman got up and did the "cut-throat" motion.  Then Sherman ran up behind Crabtree, gave him a "good game" pat on the butt, then got in front of him and put his hand out for a handshake.   Crabtree shoved him, because Sherman was being a dick.

Okay, but the cost of moving it to a different wallet ISN"T &gt;0.01 bitcoins.  It's 0.0001 bitcoin.  And there is no inconvenience or hassle.  Whether you want to move it to another online wallet, a mobile wallet, a paper wallet; it's all free and instant.
So, the question stands; why would anyone still have their BTC on BC.i?  "Opportunity Cost" or "Cost" is **not** a reason to leave their bitcoin there.

Losing the last pizza slice; the real victim of transaction malleability.
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:06:50
So, I started out typing my understanding of the situation, but it just lead me to more questions.
For example, lets say I receive bitcoin as payment for a job I perform.  Lets say it's a one time payment of 6 BTC and the day I receive it BTC is $800USD.  It is my understanding that this would be treated as taxable income, I would add $4800 to the Additional Income line on my tax return, and I would pay whatever my tax bracket tells me to.
But what about next year?  I still have that 6 BTC, and I've paid taxes on it as income.  But next year, BTC is worth $2000USD and I decide I want to sell my 6 BTC.  How would that be handled?  It certainly wouldn't be treated as ordinary income.  But it wouldn't be treated as capital gains either though, right, because I've already been taxed on it?  Taxed on the increase in value ($12000-$4800 = $7200 realized gain) like capital gains?  But that doesn't seem like it would be right / fair.
I guess maybe you'd have to look at how stock options are treated, perhaps?  If I'm an employee and I get paid $120,000 per year in salary but also receive 100 shares of my company stock as part of my compensation, how are the 100 shares handled?  They wouldn't be taxed until I sold them, right?  Wouldn't BTC be the same way then?
Meh.  See an accountant I guess.  Stupid tax law.  Stupid government.

Because Bitcoin doesn't work that way.  You can have your wallet here, there, and everywhere, but when you broadcast a transaction that uses inputs, those inputs are tied up in the Unconfirmed Transaction pile even before they get added to a block.  If you were to try and send another transaction it gets checked against the blockchain AND the Unconfirmed Tx pile.  You can't -simply- try and spend again.

Determine what kind of tone you want for your speech.  You could go all fluff, talk about the price and adoption and all the companies getting on board.  Or you can be serious and technical and talk about the blockchain.  The blockchain -is- Bitcoin.
Personally I'd start with fiat.  Talk about banks and "real" money, and how banks have their ledgers and everyone trusts you have the money you have because banks say so.  Now bring up Digital Cash that you could send as easily as an email.  Introduce the "double spend" problem; how do I know I didn't copy my cash and give it to both Alice and Sally.  This is where the public ledger comes in.   Every transaction and every address is known to everyone, so no one can cheat.  You might equate this distributed network to something like BitTorrent, which most high school students should know a little bit about.
-How banks work; trusted central authority.
-How to decentralize with digital cash -&gt; block chain solves problem
-Mining; network of computers doing computational work (proof of work, so it cannot be easily faked) in order to process and confirm transaction.  In return miners get a reward every 10 minutes, which is how new bitcoins are minted.
-Discuss benefits of Bitcoin; no boundaries, ease of transfer, low fees, decentralized
-Discuss negatives; currently "difficult" to obtain bitcoin, the initial notion of security can be a little scary, negative public perception due to Silk Road (unfounded, relate to how bad "cash" is).
That's probably how I'd approach it.

Just a followup on my order:
I ordered on January 17th for three cards; one black, one red, one gold.  I got an email on January 30th that it had shipped.  It was sent by standard post in a normal envelope and arrived today February 7th.  (So two weeks from order being placed to item being shipping, and then another week for shipping).
Here is a picture of the cards:
[Crypto Cards](
The QRs scan fine.  The cards are 0.3mm narrower and 0.4mm longer than a standard credit card.
The only imperfections I see are on the Bitcoin logo that's on the front.  The gold one looks pretty perfect, but the red and black one have some... I guess how I would describe it is if you were to put a round sticker on a piece of metal, but you had a bubble that you didn't quite get squeezed out?  Now I know this isn't a sticker, but that's the kind of "shape" I would describe it as.  Here, let me get a closeup.
Of the three I think I like the Black and Gold equally well.  The Black one is very nice contrast with a very grey text on the back.  The gold one is almost subtle when you look at the back because of the white-on-gold, but it looks cool.  On the red, the white text is very pink, but is still pretty cool.
Overall, I look forward to showing them off to some people, and then carrying one in my wallet as "emergency cash."   Very pleased with the product.

I think you (and maybe others) misunderstand that video and its relevance to Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is both the paper money AND the gold.  In the adaptation sense, Bitcoin is struggling for approval just like the paper money in the video; we are all Marco Polo here, trying to explain this new currency's worth and advantages.  But on the other hand, the Venetians are right to claim that gold is better, that it speaks and has value and doesn't depend on Trust.  Bitcoin is this gold, trying to wrestle control back AWAY from paper money.
So, to accurately turn this video to a literal display of Bitcoin's situation, you would need the Venetians arguing for paper money because it is the current standard, and Marco Polo coming in with New Electronic Gold and trying to display how it has value because of what it represents and how easy it is to transfer.

I'm just saying, at first glance, saying 1151900% faster transaction speed is unbelievable, or at least meaningless.  Just my opinion, you can do what you want of course.
I guess more to the point, stating it as a percentage isn't the best way to relate this particular piece of data.  "With bitcoin, funds are available in a matter of minutes, as opposed to waiting 8 days for a traditional bank transfer."  Percentages are good for figures that are close together.  "10% increased return," "50% less time," "300% more chickens."  But 1 Minute vs 8 Days really drives home the message more than "1238743% faster" ever could, because the number is laughably big and hard to relate to.

For everyone asking "why?" it is because of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.
"The Net Asset Value of the Trust will be calculated daily and is the aggregate value of the Trust’s assets less its liabilities (which include estimated accrued but unpaid fees and expenses). In determining the NAV of the Trust, the Trustee will value the price of the bitcoins in the Trust Custody Account as determined by the price of bitcoins at 4:00 p.m. on Winkdex (“WinkdexSM spot price”). See “Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market” for descriptions of the Winkdex spot price and the operation of the Bitcoin exchange market (“Bitcoin Exchange Market”) from which prices are used to determine the Winkdex spot price. The Trustee will determine the NAV of the Trust on each day the [EXCHANGE] is open for regular trading (“Evaluation Day”), as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. New York time."
The Winkdex is mentioned over 100 times in their SEC filing.  It is necessary for them to have a solid reference for valuating their price.  They can't trust a single exchange price, obviously, and they can't trust some random third-party average (because the Winklevii don't know how that average was determined), so they need their own index.
That's all.   It's not merely re-inventing the wheel for no reason, it's a necessary component of their Trust.

Maybe it is my human predilection for trying to identify patterns, but I'm with you.  Ramp, spike, crash, rebound, settle, steady for a few months.  Repeat.  
Now, my opinion means jack nothing, but it would be cool if we are just in that steady period, where over the next 5 months the price will slowly climb, and then around May it increases more rapidly, spikes to x7 the steady price, and then settles out at 60-70% of the spiked value.
Not that you were looking for prediction, or that my "prediction" means anything but wouldn't it be cool to see steady increase from ~$800 up to about ~900 over the next 5 months, then an increasing run up over the next month to a spike of around $6500-$7000, crash back to around $3000, then a rebound and settling out over the next month to a new steady price of $5000.

About as impossible as you can get while still being "possible."  There are somewhere around 10^48 addresses.   48 zeros.  You could generate hundreds of trillions of addresses every second since the beginning of time and still not come remotely close to generating all the addresses.

Just kind of paraphrasing this:
Q: IRS will treat bitcoin as property.  What are you thoughts and how does it affect you?
[0:08-1:43]( A: Surprised it came out without time for public comment.  If we could offer feedback we would have been able to say it was an untenable position.  It's great for investors to get the clarity about capital gains, but when using bitcoin as a currency I would have to report it as capital gains.  This is unlike any other currency.  If invest in another currency (Euro) in a brokerage account then it is treated (correctly) as capital gains.  But if I fly to Europe and exchange my USD for Euros and use it to pay for admission to a Zoo, I don't have to pay capital gains on that.  Accounting for every cup of coffee is not reasonable.
I want clarity.  "We want to pay our taxes." [He thinks for a second]  "I want to pay my taxes."
Q: Do you believe the fact that IRS didn't open for public discussion shows a lack of bitcoin representation in Washington.
[2:08-3:12]( A: No, we have plenty of representatives that go to Washington to talk to people.  It is a problem with an insular culture in the IRS and they didn't do their homework and made a declaration with this ruling without asking about the implications.  The government took a stand back approach back in the start of the internet and let it develope, and we need the same opportunity to explain and educate the government.  The ruling right now would create a mountain of paperwork for the currency usage of bitcoin.
Q: This ruling applies to fiscal year 2013 and came out mere weeks before the April 15th deadline.  Will you have to redo everything?
[3:26-4:16](  A: Last year I had every little in capital gains and investment, but yes I'll have to redo it.  But what happens in 2020 when they come back and want to ask me about currency usage for buying coffee in 2014, if I make a little mistake and now owe 6 years of interest because the rules aren't clear or reasonable.  We don't have the mechanisms for that level of accounting right now.   A lot of people are going to be burdened by a ruling that is untenable.
Q: The government so far hadn't really acknowledged bitcoin.  Do you think there is an upside to this IRS ruling giving some legitimacy to bitcoin?
[4:47-5:19]( A: It's important to have clarity so I'm glad for that.  I'm glad the conversation is started, but this should have started before the ruling.  We can explain why it's a bad idea to treat it only as property, and why it should be treated as property when it's used as property and investment and treated as currency when it's used as currency, just like every other currency is treated. And again, I want to pay my taxes, so I want this clarity.

Yes, Bitcoin will certainly gain more widespread adoption.
[edit] I'll explain why I think that.   I don't even have the greatest technical knowledge of Bitcoin and I understand how revolutionary the tech is, how useful it is, how robust it is, and how important it could be.  And there are a great many very smart people who are behind it supporting it.  I don't feel like it's a fad; it's too useful to be a fad.

I think the collision question comes up every time.  The number of possible addresses is somewhere in the order of 10^47.  This is a very very big number.  For comparison, there have been 4.3*10^17 seconds since the big bang.  So you could have trillions of computers generating trillions of addresses a trillion times per second since the beginning of time and STILL not be getting collisions.
It is pretty much a statistical impossibility.

Paper wallets seem like the easiest and least complex solution, which is why I use them.  You don't have to worry about figuring out multiple computer programs or dealing with encryption volumes or whatever.   Offline generate some BIP38 wallets (which is trivially simple), print them out.   Now make copies of the paper, or take a picture of them and save that file, or save the addresses/keys as text and email them to yourself.  As long as you ensure your BIP38 is very strong, you could litter a city with your paper wallets and be safe.
And there is never even a possibility of a wallet.dat file being left somewhere or not getting backed up correctly or getting a harddrive corrupted or accidentally overwriting a file.

Taken from another question, but maybe he's talking about the private key hash?  I remember someone mentioning something like "The reason you don't want to re-use a paper wallet (i.e. send the change back to the same paper wallet) is because once you send off a paper wallet the private key hash has been sent to the network."
I'm really just stringing together Bitcoin related words here that I don't necessarily fully understand.  I get the whole "re-using the key will let someone who is so inclined to view all your transaction" which at this point I don't care much about.

This is similar to the "Every shuffled deck of cards is unique" idea, which I've seen references on both vSauce youtube channel as well as on QI (the British comedy/trivia show with Stephen Fry).  The number of unique decks of cards is 52 * 51 * 50.... or 52! (factorial) or 8.07x10^67.  
To get an idea of how big 8x10^67 is.   Consider a trillion galaxies.  And in each galaxy is a trillion stars.  And each star has a trillion planets.  And on each planet is a trillion people.   Now if each of those people were shuffling 200 decks of cards **every second**, from the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago, they would just now be repeating combinations.

Why do you say it only makes sense when price is $50k/BTC?  Because the number of bits is "too big" until that point?  I can understand the perspective from someone dealing with USD or Pounds or Euros, but one needs to remember there are already currencies that deal with large numbers.  Pesos are about 10:1 with USD, Yen is 100:1.  
The biggest thing to acknowledge is that Big Numbers are easier to deal with than Very Small Numbers.   Hundreds, Thousands, and Millions are easy to understand, and have a nice notation with commas / periods (13,000,000).  Small decimals don't have the notation, and aren't used often (if at all) by the general public.

Looking at Bitcoinity's charts for bitstamp right now, a you could put down $1.3 million to buy 5600 bitcoins and drive the price up to $230.
Think about that a second.  You could $1.3 million dollars into that order book and only buy up 5600 bitcoins.  That's less than 2 day's worth of freshly minted bitcoins (3600 per day are getting mined).  That $1.3 million would get them 0.03% of all the bitcoin (rough math, I didn't bother to check the exact number of bitcoins right now, 18M or so I think).
That buy order would drive the price up, as would subsequent buys.

I didn't watch this video, but I did listen to Joe Rogan's podcast.  The best way for you to realize that this is important is to continue the comparison to the internet.  Talking about Bitcoin only as it relates to the BTC currency would be akin to the internet only talking about email.  Look at this email, you can send a letter, isn't that cool.  Email, email is where it is at.  But that would be ignoring everything else like http, p2p sharing, distributed sharing like torrents, etc etc etc.

I'd concur.  If you have a paper wallet with 1 BTC on it and you sweep that to Coinbase, then later send 0.1 BTC to the paper wallet address, your paper wallet will have 0.1 BTC on it.  You would have to sweep it again to Coinbase to transfer that amount.

And this is what makes my mind break every time I see it and start thinking about it.
21 million bitcoin.  21 million people with 1 bitcoin each.  1 bitcoin each isn't a lot, and 21 million people isn't a lot.
The equations are all screwed up and it's hard to reconcile.  Currently there are a lot (relative term) of people who control more (many more) than 1 bitcoin.  So if this whole Bitcoin thing is going to a place of mass acceptance, where millions of people are using it, then the amount of bitcoin being transacted will necessarily be in the small fractions of bitcoin.  
e.g. If there are 210,000,000 people (3% of the global population) transacting in bitcoin, the most they could have is 0.1 BTC each, but wealth isn't evenly distributed so it's more likely to be 0.01 or even 0.001 BTC each.  But in order to conduct any reasonable transfer of value, that 0.01 or 0.001 BTC will need to be worth a significant amount of value.
And thus why it breaks my brain.  In order for bitcoin to work on a large scale the value per BTC needs to be huge.
Which makes me skeptical sometimes.  Part of me thinks that it must be impossible for this to happen.  Maybe it's just being unable to grasp the possibility that my 20+ bitcoin could be worth so much.

You are on the "right" side of the issue, but with poor arguments (IMO).  It's not about the feels, it's about the brain.  It's much easier to handle large numbers than small numbers, partially because of the comma delimited nature of large numbers.  12,000,000.  What is that number?  12 million.   235,203,592.  Two hundred thirty-five million, two hundred three thousand, five hundred ninety-two.  What about 0.00343954.  What's that number.  Quick.  Is that millionths?  Ten thousandths?  
If you respond with "Oh well that's easy, it's [whatever your answer]" then bully for you, but that's not the case with nearly anyone.   The conversion comes later and is irrelevant.  People already deal with large currency amounts (and conversions) every day.  What they don't deal with is 8 decimal places and decimal math, as "easy" as you want to say that is.

I woke up this morning and thought "wow, did i actually catch the knife this time!?" after buying 5 btc @ $170 yesterday.
We'll see.  
(Looking through my history, I made a series of purchases in the December 2013 and the following months at $855, $773, $558, $795, and $734.  Then through Q4 of 2014 I was making smaller weekly buys in the $425 down to $300 range.  Then more more recent days at $280, $245, and finally at $174.  Looks like my basis right now is around $450 or so.  I'm still feeling alright about everything, it's a decent sum of money but only like 10% of my total investments.  Like I said, we'll see how it goes.  I was happy when I hit 10 BTC, then achieved my goal of 21 BTC, and now have even more.)

The sad part is that the above is one of the few reasons I ever doubt bitcoin.  
I think of the fundamentals, all of the money and smart people behind bitcoin and it gives me confidence that this thing is real and is going to last and be important.  But when I think "Only 21 million people could ever possibly own 1 whole bitcoin" (and I know my current holdings) I just can't picture that I could ever be lucky enough to be in on such a huge gamble that (will supposedly) put me in the top fraction of a percent on the global wealth scale.
I just cannot fathom that reality, which makes me doubt it will happen.

I think you are not understanding what the graph says.  It's easier to understand if you start with the 8 yr button and step through it.
If you hit the 8 years button the line jumps over to the left to October 2010 (8 years ago), and the "Top Dormant for 8 years Bitcoin Addresses" display a bunch of addresses that have not had any "Out" transactions since October 2010 or earlier.  i.e. that bitcoin address has been dormant for 8 years.   The graph at the top shows 1.74M BTC.
Change to 7 years.  Line jumps to October 2011.  The list updates (top address now is a 79,957 BTC monster from March of 2011).  2.34M BTC are in addresses that have been dormant for 7 years or longer.
Jumping ahead to 1 year.  Bar is over at the right at October 2017.   The list now shows addresses with BTC that haven't moved in 1 year or more.  Down at number 9 you can see an April 2017 address with 36k bitcoin that hasn't moved since 4/20/2017.  The black line on the graph shows that 7.97M BTC have been sitting in addresses for 1 year or longer.
But if you keep going to the right, hover over the red line as far as you can go, it says August 01 2018 and displays 15.81M bitcoin.  But that number just means 15.81M bitcoin have not moved from their addresses in the past two months.  But that's kind of expected, right?   I mean, I haven't moved my bitcoin since... last year sometime?
So your title of 15 million bitcoins sleeping, you are really saying that 15.81M bitcoin haven't moved since August of 2018.
If you started counting from today, then 17.3M BTC have been dormant for 1 day or more.

Sold 10% at $700 and paid off my car.  Sold another 10% at $1000 and paid off my student loans.   Sold another 10% at $1700 and paid off my house.   Now I don't have any more debt, so no reason to sell any more.
Had brunch with my parents, they asked me what bitcoin was at now, and my dad said "You should sell half."  For what?  So I can throw more dollars into a checking account or investment account and let it sit there?   I already have enough over there, I'll just let it sit in bitcoin and see how it goes.

For a long time I was happily gobbling up the "Stuff You Should Know..." podcast, saying to myself "Wow, this is so interesting, I'm learning so much, this is great."   Then they did an episode on Bitcoin and I'm like, "Well that's not right.  No.  That's wrong too.  That's close to right but is way more nuanced than that.   What the fuck is this bullshit?!?"
Luckily at this point I recognized the Gell-Mann effect and said "Maybe this podcast **isn't** really that great.  What the hell else have they gotten way wrong."

You are completely misunderstanding this chart, or at least you are pushing a conclusion that is meaningless.
First off, this chart hasn't been updated since June 1st.
Secondly, all this chart is saying is "On June 1st, only 0.3% of BTC has moved since June 1st."
Well, no shit, right?   On any given day, the number of bitcoins that have moved since today are whatever have been put in block that day.
This chart will always how 99.x% dormant as of the current date.
As linked to, check the chart on 
Hover over the right hand edge and you'll see the same kind of breakdown.     If you looked at that image, you could post "As of October 17th 2019, 99.02% of bitcoin is inactive / dormant."   Well... not really.   99.02% of bitcoin didn't move **today**.  But if you look at the breakdown, you'll see around 20% of unspent outputs have moved in the past 3 months.
(Personally, most of my UTXOs are in that 18-24 month bin...)
The actual number:    it looks like 88.3% of BTC didn't move in June 2019.

I'm not sure where the quote "biggest election victory imaginable" is coming from. Either way, not sure why that necessarily means margin.

The day of the election Hillary was going in with polling numbers saying 99% chance of winning.
When University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) Retrievers defeated the Virginia Cavaliers 74–54 in the first round and became the first 16 seed to beat a number 1 seed, you can say that was the biggest playoff victory imaginable for that team. The score wasn't the highest, the differential wasn't the highest. But for University of Maryland, that was certainly the biggest playoff victory imaginable for them.

Just executing my plan at this point: sell 1 BTC on a 20% rise, buy 1 BTC on a 20% drop.  Sold one at $6k, sold one at $7200, bought one at $5750, sold one at $7450 this morning (overshot my +20% target of $6900, oops).   
Now with baseline at $7450, next sell is at $9000 and buy at $6000.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:23:13
See picture that shows the order book on GDAX.  The column of numbers on the left are Limit Orders, people who have said "I want to sell 1.14765376 BTC for $10639.99" and "I want to buy 0.42147775 BTC for $10602.50" etc.  The "Market Price" is where the Buys and Sells meet in the middle; $10608.72 in the picture.  
The vertical lines on the bottom graph are so-called Buy Walls and Sell Walls.  They represent a limit order (or multiple limit orders from various people) that is a large amount of BTC at a single price.   The price cannot move above a "Sell Wall" until all of those bitcoins are bought at that price (or the seller removes the order from the book).
So what was happening was there would be something like "I want to sell 100 BTC for $9950."   That sell wall is a million dollars in USD.  People would need to buy a million dollars worth of bitcoin before the price could move above $9950.
And it works both ways, depending on which way the market is moving.  Those green Buy Walls are saying "Hey, I'm willing to buy 100 BTC for $10,600 before the price will drop below $10,600."  
Note that walls aren't necessarily "real" since you can cancel an order on the book at any time (provided you are watching).   Sometimes you will see a big wall pop up in an effort to influence the market's movement, but it will disappear before that order gets filled.
(Side note, in the 12 minutes or whatever it took me to write this post, this is what the price is now:    $10,771.48.   What a wild night we are having, eh?)

I sold earlier this year and paid off student loan and mortgage.  Now I'm selling off a coin every 20% price increase (and buying a coin on every 20% drop).  This structured method is the only way I can force myself to take some profits, and force myself to buy dips.

"Match" means that a matching buy order was found for your sell order.   The Fee looks like a 0.3% fee for your trade.
It looks like you went to sell 0.02 BTC and you placed your order as a "Market Sell" which is you telling GDAX "Here is my 0.02 BTC, please sell it at market price to whomever is buying BTC right now."   You got matched to three different buyers, two at 0.005 BTC each and one at 0.01 BTC.  That's why there are three Match entries, three different people bought your BTC.
However, because you put your order in as a Market order, you had to pay a fee because you were a "Taker."  You "took" whatever offer was in the order book.   Instead, next time, you can make a Limit order, where you say "I want to sell my 0.02 BTC for $10,200."  Or whatever price you want.  That order (as long as it's not instantly filled) will go on the order book and will be filled whenever the market moves over that price.  So if the current market were sitting at $10341, you could say "Sell my 0.02 BTC for $10342!"   It would go on the book right above that 10341, and as soon as the price moved up a little your order would fill, you'd get your money, and you wouldn't pay an exchange fee because you were a Market Maker, not a Market Taker.

Different exchanges in different places. Local Bitcoins might be $8,000, coinbase maybe $7,500, and I might offer to sell you one for $9,000. Those are all "the price."  But as long as the currency is fluid enough and has enough velocity, arbitrage smoothes out the differences.  But if it's hard to get Bitcoin in or out of a country, or rather fiat currency in or out of the country, that can increase the price of Bitcoin. For example if a nation's currency is going through hyperinflation, people might want to buy Bitcoin as a store of value, and pay a premium in order to get that Bitcoin because it would be in high demand in that country.

I don't see bitcoin mentioned anywhere on that page, or that website.  And BTC is not one of the options on the currency drop-down list.   So are you saying "You can buy an island for about $62,000,000... which is about 8,000 bitcoin if you converted that BTC to USD on an exchange first"?
Also, you'd expect a website that sells islands to get some more high definition photography.  Those pictures are JPG garbage.

If you are a "Maker" and set a limit order, then you do not pay any fee when your order is filled.
A limit order just means you are dictating the amount and price you want, and it gets put on the order book.   So like right now BTC is trading at $9744.   I could place a limit order that says "I want to BUY 1 BTC at $9700."  That order would not be immediately filled (no one is going to sell you 1 BTC when market is at $9744), so your order goes on the book.  Now if the market moves down to a point where BTC is trading at $9700, someone else's sell order of X BTC for $9700 will collide with your buy order of 1 BTC for $9700 and your order will be filled.
See screenshot below of what that looks like on GDAX's interface.
(And if you do and up just wanting to make a market order, i.e. "Give me 1 BTC for whatever the market price is," then you'll get charged a "taker" fee of 0.25%.  This is still much less than the fees you'd pay with a Coinbase "Buy It Now" click, which is 0.5% above market price, PLUS a 1.5% fee.)

For that short period of time over the weekend there was mirroring because of the specific circumstances. It's not because BCH is bought using Bitcoin though. BCH is bought using other altcoins too, or cash, and other altcoins are also bought with Bitcoin, and you don't see the mirroring in any of these other situations. And you won't see the mirroring between bch and Bitcoin going forward either. You're looking at a small period of time and drawing a conclusion that isn't really valid.

People are hesitant to keep bitcoin on an exchange platform due to the history of things going wrong (MtGox, etc).  The saying is "If you don't have the keys, you don't have the bitcoin."

I placed a Coinbase Spot Price buy on November 12th, the money went out of my checking account on November 14th, and the Bitcoin showed up in the Coinbase account show up on November 21st.
When you use the "Buy It Now" option on Coinbase the whole thing takes a while.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:16:03
The Coinbase "Buy it now" and "Sell it now" price is 0.5% above or below the GDax market price, and you'll get a 1.5% fee on top of it.
Right now GDax is $8900 and Coinbase is a Buy It Now for $8945.  Plus the $134 fee.   So if you have cash in your GDax account it will be $8900, or the Buy It Now of $9079.

Better question, why haven't they already? I think it's reasonable to say that any billionaire in the world must have heard of Bitcoin by now. They **must** know about Bitcoin. It would be impossible for them to have not run across any article or mention of Bitcoin.
Only one Bitcoin right now is such a tiny fraction of their wealth, it seems like there shouldn't be a question that they should own one. It's like if they're presented with a stock and someone said buy one share of this stock because it might be a huge thing in the future, it would be silly not to.
Just one. Imagine if they were presented with one share of Apple stock and someone said this has the potential to be life changing in the future.

Personally, I'd chalk up that piece of titanium as a loss.  I had the same situation, I had three engraved steel "credit cards" that I used for cold storage for years.   But in order to pull the BCH off of those wallets I needed to expose the private keys to software.   So I bought a Trezor, moved everything (three colds and mobile wallet) onto the Trezor, then loaded those keys into the BCH software to split the token off.
Now those old Cold Storage plates sit in my safe.  (Never destroy a wallet.)   So they will sit there forever empty.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:06:25
Well once you've swept the keys and aren't using it anymore, someone might say "well, it's empty now, I'll never use it again, I can just get rid of it and forget about it."  Without really thinking, someone might do that.
Just reminding: don't do that.   Even if you've swept a wallet, exposed the private key, don't plan on using that wallet's seeds again: Just put it into an envelope marked "Old Wallet Info" and leave it in your safe next to your active backups.

There's certainly a mental barrier to buying BTC at $6500 when most of my buys were sub-$1000 years ago.  So I've done a few things to fix that situation.  Primarily, I have a standing bi-weekly buy of $100.  But I've also established a rule for myself that  started with the $6000 all time high.
If the price goes up 20% to a new ATH, I will sell one bitcoin.  (Current target $7200.)
If the price goes down 20%, I will buy one bitcoin.  (Current target $4800.)
If one of those targets is hit, that becomes the new baseline and new targets are established.  e.g. $7200, the next sell point is $8640 and buy point is $5760.
I don't know if this is smart or not, but it is a structured plan to 1) buy in on significant dips and 2) realize gains on my existing bitcoin.
With the stash I have, if I keep to the +20% sell structure, I will have millions before all the bitcoin is gone.  That's good enough for me I think.   (And if bitcoin crashes to nothing, and I buy all the way down for every 20% drop, I'll be shelling out about $20,000.)

Coinbase "buy it now" or "sell it now" lock-in price is 0.5% above / below the Gdax market price.  With an additional 1.5% service fee.
It's the price you pay for one-button easy service.
When selling bitcoin, there's no reason you shouldn't be using Gdax directly since you can place a limit order, get exactly the correct market price with no fee.   However for buying bitcoin, in order to use Gdax and get market price with no fee, you need to have money already transferred to your USD account. Some people don't like having money tied up on an exchange just to be able to instantly buy. Additional plus side to buying directly on gdax is you instantly have your bitcoin available to transfer out to your wallet.
Also, if you use Gdax to send BTC out to you wallet, Gdax pays the miner fee.  Coinbase will charge you the miner fee.

All bitcoin transactions that are broadcast to the network but are waiting to be added to a block get tossed into the Mempool.  Picture a big swimming pool filled with transactions, and each transaction is holding up a sign advertising the fee they are paying.  Fees are in the unit of Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) per Byte.   So a 13 Sat/B fee on a 260 byte transaction would have a 3380 satoshi (0.00003380 BTC, ~$0.33) fee.  When miners come to mine a block, they check the mempool and pick the transactions with the highest fee schedule.
As for the chart, every color band is a different fee or range of fees.   The Key for the chart is on the left.   The different Blue bands are 1 sat/B up through about 10 sat/B, etc.
The mempool transactions ramp up, ramp up, ramp up, then spike drop down as a Block is mined and a group of transactions (usually around 2000) are removed from the mempool and locked down into a Block on the Blockchain.
By looking at the bands, and seeing where the line drops down to, tells you what fee level is clearing.

None of Satoshi's coins have moved.  They aren't all in one single address.   All of the original coinbase transactions are right where they have always been and unspent:

But he wouldn't be double taxed.  His bitcoin would have a basis set when he obtained them.
For example, lets say his paycheck is $3000.  His company takes out $200 pre-tax for his 401k, $50 for his health insurance, and pulls another $750 worth of federal income tax, state tax, medicare, and social security.   This leaves him with his $2000 take-home paycheck.
It's this $2000 that the company would convert into bitcoin.  Lets use $10,000 for this, so he gets 0.2 BTC.  Now buddy sits on this 0.2 BTC for a few weeks, then needs come cash for bills.  Bitcoin is now $12,000.   He sells 0.1 BTC for some fiat, so he gets $1200.  That 0.1 BTC had a basis of $1000, so he will owe $200 in short term cap gains, at the same 23% or whatever his normal income tax rate is.  He would owe this tax the following April when tax time comes.
He's not losing anything.

Nice.   Bittrex never got that good of a number that night.  It was a really funny situation, I had been sitting on the fork for a while and hadn't really looked into claiming the coins yet.  But in early November I got my Trezor in and it just so happened that November 11th I transferred everything over to the Trezor so I could free up the paper wallet to import for BCH.
And it just do happened to be on the night where the absolute best exchange rate to BCH/BTC we'll (probably) ever see.

Did you actually get 0.5 BTC?   I also sold mine on November 12th, just got super lucky with the timing, and got mine traded for 0.289 BTC.

Nothing wrong with taking profits along the way.  Here's a snip of some of my action over the past couple months.
Buy/Sell|Amount BTC|$USD
Bought on the way down, sold on the way up.  Ignoring the sell at $18k, I bought 5 BTC on the way down for a total of $52,171, and sold on the way up 3 BTC for $31,770 with 2 BTC left to sell.  I plan to sell at $13,460 and $16,150, which would bring my buying of 5 @ $52171 total to be sells of 5 @ $61380 total, so a $9k gain.  (If I sold those last two tonight I'd only realize a $2k gain).
This is just buying on every 20% drop and selling on every 20% raise.

Simple math and two seconds of thought tell me that if the number of transactions is a quarter of normal (550 vs 2000+) but still a 1MB block, then the size of those transactions must be four times as big.
But I guess if you don't know simple math, and don't give it two seconds of thought, I can see how that could lead some people to post "Finally people stop using bitcoin." and "When you force high fees and long wait times for 2 years, this is what happens."

I understand that there is an abstraction here that would eventually lead to "greed" as being the reason to ignore small transactions.  However, when presented with the question of "why are they leaving money on the table" it's stupid to respond with "They are greedy as fuck!"   That simplistic answer does not really respond to the question.
If you really want to go down the path, you need to set up your answer with the "They are greedy by trying to manipulate the fee market and 'price fix' by leaving cheap txs to rot on the vine."   This is a bit of a stretch as an answer because no one else is into the price fixing game with them.  So it makes the Greedy AF response even more WTF.
However, I think the real answer is more stupidity than malice: they just haven't updated their mining settings to allow that minimum fee.

Yup.   The probability of seeing 8 heads in a row is 0.5^8 or 0.40% chance.   But given even just 200 fair coin flips, you could expect to see a run of 8 heads once or even twice in that population.

No risk, people have been using BIP38 for cold wallets for years.  I ordered three laser engraved aluminum cards four years ago for cold storage.   (They are now retired since I moved the coins off to a SegWit address and exposed the cold storage keys to other Apps to get my Fork Coins.  Now I use a Trezor.)
You offline generate a private key, BIP38 encrypt it with your strong password (e.g. CorrectHorseBatteryStaple), and then send that encrypted key off to the card manufacturer to get made.
You could distribute flyers around your city with your BIP38 address and it would still be secure.  (Assuming you don't actually use CorrectHorseBatteryStaple).
[Edit: Looks like the guy who I bought my cards from, [Crypto Cards]( in Canada, is out of business now.  His website is down and he hasn't Tweeted since March of 2014.   Oh yeah, and I paid 0.05 BTC for three cards, which was only $42 back then.

Reread what you are replying to. 


For his estimations he's overestimating hashrate by 1000 times, and says by the time we're at that point you'd be using all of Earth's energy to mine Bitcoin. This jives with what you are saying, that Bitcoin only counts for 0.2% of the world's energy usage.  Increase that a thousand fold and that's 200% of the world's energy use.
He's saying that even if you way overestimate future hashing, it still doesn't affect the possibility of collisions.

Times are GMT, so right around midnight is when the BTC price on Kraken bottomed out at about $5500, and it looks like BCH peaked at around 2600, and that confluence of prices only happened for a brief period of time.
I am having a hard time finding a good historical chart of the actual BCH/BTC trading numbers.

Does anyone else like comedy?  Stuff like ["Talking Funny"]( comedians discussing their craft.   I'd be super interested in a good comedian refining this joke.
"Subway is no stranger to Bitcoin."  This is a perfect setup.  No change needed.  But the second line can be worked I think.   Off the top, I think the "if you catch my drift" can be dropped; you don't need the extra wink and nod, we get it.
So "Jared has been using Bitcoin for years on the darknet."  In text it's a little flat, but if it were being delivered aloud I bet some inflection could spice it up.  But I wonder if it's still a little too on the nose.  Maybe "Jared has been using it for years!" is better?  You might lose some audience by not spelling out Bitcoin and Darknet, but I think it hits a little harder for people who do know the situation.  You are rewarding your audience for being smart and getting the reference.  Making them think about the joke for a moment in order to get it make them appreciate it more.
I wonder if there's a kid pun that could be thrown in, in lieu of the Bitcoin and Darknet reference.   I don't have it right now, but I think there's something there.

My only "forgotten" bitcoin moment was early on.   I guy I played games with online was always talking about Bitcoin, he was buying mining equipment etc in late 2012 and early 2013.  The run up and spike in April 2013 got me interested, but I didn't know much then so I just paypal'ed this dude $2000 and told him to buy bitcoin.
He bought bitcoin, did some other stuff (investing in cloud mining or something, I dunno), and when about six months later we settled up.  He sent me back 14 bitcoin.
I sold 11.3 bitcoin to get my $2000 back.   I -thought- I had also initiated a sell on the remaining 2.7 bitcoin at ~$190 each to pull out the extra $500 I made.  Turns out I didn't (something was wrong with the transaction and it got canceled).
Fast forward a couple months to December 2013 and the huge run-up.  I of course hear about it and log into my Coinbase.  Wow, there's 2.7 bitcoin there.  Wow, that's worth like another $2200.  Nice surprise.
(But then I didn't sell it, I started buying more.  Yes I bought at $900 per BTC, and down the slope at $700 and $550.  I picked some good spots too, had $100 per week buys going, and snapped up about 17 bitcoin when it briefly went [sub-$250 in Jan and Aug 2015](    It's all gone now, but I paid off all my car, student loan, and mortgage debt, so no regrets.)

That's funny, I have a similar story. I needed one class left to graduate and it was a technical elective (basically any science, engineering, or math) so I decided to take Number Theory.  The course guide had a prereq of like algebra only. I have been through four different types of calculus classes so I thought it would be a pushover. It was not, I failed the class just barely.  It was ALL theory and proofs (duh...) with quite a bit of stuff about cryptography. I did not grasp it at all.

I want to sell 0.1 BTC.  On an exchange right now it's $7000. so I'd get $700.
If I went to this bitcoin ATM, the spread is probably like 4% (so it will sell you a bitcoin for $7280 buy a bitcoin for $6720).  So you sell your 0.1 BTC and get $672.  But then there's a 6.5% ATM fee, which is $43.68.
So instead of getting $700, you only get 628.32.  You've paid 11% for the privilege of using a bitcoin ATM.   That's worse than using a CoinStar!
EDIT:  A quick google brought up a site that says (who knows if this is accurate though): "Current worldwide average bitcoin ATM fee is 8.4% for buying bitcoins from machines, and 5.4% for selling bitcoins for cash."
So if you want to buy a $7000 bitcoin from an ATM it will cost you $7588, and if you want to sell one of your $7000 bitcoins then the ATM will pay you $6622 for it.

I haven't filed yet, but going to put it together this weekend.
It's kind of a pain in the ass splitting all the lots.  Here is a mock spreadsheet showing what I'm doing.  (All my sells last year were long term holds.)
You end up splitting buy and sell lots and needing to pair everything up.   It's cumbersome and I haven't found a really great way to automate it myself, but I have all the data so it shouldn't be too bad.
I wish I could just do it like the top half: here are all the coins I sold with an aggregated cost basis, and here is the aggregated total of the sells, so here's the final number.  But instead they want everything paired up.
EDIT:  Well, I just took the last 45 minutes and did my spreadsheet.  I ended up having 10 total sells in 2017 that I need to report, which pairs up against 23 different BUYs from a few years ago.   It ended up being 45 lines in excel to pair everything up by splitting the lots appropriately.  All done in 45 minutes, so that wasn't horrible.  And when all was said and done, the math turned out as I expected it to (from doing it the Aggregate way before).

Because when the centrally located Walmart distribution center ships a product that has a price tag already on it, they don't know what store it's going to.   Because when centrally located Walmart rolls out their UPC code scanning system, the prices loaded into that system are all the universal price, not with the extra 1.2% tax because you live in Metropolis, or the 2.15% tax because you live in Bigtax County.  Because when centrally located Walmart is printing out the marketing displays and aisle cards, it has that base price, not unique prices for whatever municipality those marketing materials end up.
Because it's easier to have a single line item at the end of the receipt to deal with the sales tax of 9.5% in Los Angeles, vs 10.25% in Long Beach, vs 7.75% in Huntington Beach, even though those three places are all within 30 miles.
Because certain taxes have different tax treatments when it comes to being deductible.   If I'm saving receipts for when I do my taxes, I'd need those taxes broken out anyway.  Difficult if it's rolled into the normal sale price.

You have $10,000.  You borrow $30,000 from the broker using your $10k as collateral.  You buy 6 bitcoin with this $40,000 ($6666.66 per BTC).
You are hoping the price of bitcoin will go up.   Say it goes up to $8000, you can sell your 6 bitcoin for $48k, pay back the $30k, and are left with $10k + $8000 in profit.  (Compared to not using margin, you buy 1.5 BTC @ $6666 with your $10k and sell for $12,000 ( and only made $2k.)
However, if bitcoin goes down you could be "liquidated."  You still owe $30,000 to your broker and have 6 BTC, so if the price drops to $5,000 your 6 BTC will be sold off (liquidated) automatically in order to pay back the $30,000 loan, and you would be left with nothing.
The amount you borrow compared to your start collateral is your Leverage.   10x leverage would be borrowing $100,000 with your $10,000.  This is more risky because you get liquidated sooner.  Same price examples, you buy 16.5 BTC with your $110k  
You owe $100k, so your liquidation price is $100k / 16.5 BTC = $6060.   If the price drops by just 10% your position will be liquidated and you get nothing.  Before with the 3x leverage, the price needed to drop $1666 (25%) before you got rekt.
(In this post we are talking about shorts, which is the same thing but backwards.  You are borrowing bitcoin at $6666, selling it, and promising to give back bitcoin in the future.  You are hoping the price will drop so you can buy back the bitcoin at a lower price, give the BTC back, and pocket the difference.   But if the price goes up too much you'll be forced to buy the BTC at the higher price and pay it back immediately.  That's what happened this morning.)

They are counting how many of the remaining blocks need to signal in order to hit 80%.
Total Blocks|Current Blocks|Current Signaled Blocks|% of Current Blocks Signaled|% of Total Blocks Signaled|
|Blocks Needed for 80%|Blocks Remaining|Signaling Blocks Needed|% of Remaining Blocks Needed|
There are 34 blocks left in this "set."  We need 269 of the 336 block set to hit 80%.  Right now 250 of the 302 blocks are signalling, so we need 19 more to hit 269, out of the 34 remaining.  So only 56% of the remaining blocks need to signal to hit the threshold.

It's such a weird situation.  For example I wanted to sell some BTC at various times at various price points.  I know about the $10,000 thing, so I kept withdraws to around $6000 each time.  Both because of the $10k thing, but also because I didn't **want** to sell $10k worth of BTC.  So if I sold $6k worth in July of 2016, January of 2017, and May of 2017... is that structuring?  It's kind of bullshit, but law would seem to say Yes because it's multiple deposits of less than $10k and (part of) the reason for the chosen amount is because of that reporting limit.

Get started with the signup process for Coinbase.  There's a bit of verification involved with yourself and the bank.

I'd just use the Chase card.  If you are doing things right, it should never ever get charged.  (And you wouldn't want it to be charged.)
Anyway, logging into Coinbase and go to the Buy/Sell screen, on the right hand side it says :
"Enable Instant Buy to get your coins in seconds instead of days."
If I click that little Instant Buy link it takes me to the page where I can click to add a credit card.  On the right side it says:
**Enable Instant Buy**
Regular buys take 4 business days -- enable Instant Buy and get your coins in seconds
1) ~~Link a bank account~~
2) Add a Credit Card
3) ~~Verify your identity~~
-- So anyway, to me, it seemed pretty clear what the whole deal was.

Why do people post this rubbish?

Sell any of the LTC?  Nope, I still have it all.   All like $2000 worth of it.
I'm considering selling it and buying Bitcoin in order to harvest the capital loss for taxes.  I have a few ten thousand in LTGC from January of this year that I'd like to get rid of.

I had some fraction of BCH show up in Coinbase, enough though I didn't think I was holding **any** BTC on Coinbase at the time of the split.  It's worth like 7 bucks right now.  I'm not even going to bother, I'll just let it sit there and rot.

First thing this morning I log in and see 2000+ upvoted suicide line on top of I freaked out thinking something extreme had happened.  I actually sighed with relief when I saw it was just that price was down to $550.
Scared me for no reason.  Suicide people, really?

Sorry about the small brain.

I'm giving my Mom, Dad, and Brother each a paperwallet with 0.1 BTC on it.  I'm going to give them the option:
1) You can have me give you $50 right now and I'll take it off your hands, if you don't want to deal with it at all.
2) I can help you get an active wallet, transfer it to an exchange, and withdraw your money into fiat, which will net you about $65 right now.
3) You can keep it in that ziplock bag and throw it in your safe.   At some later date it might be worth nothing, or you might be able to buy a car with it.  Who knows.
It's up to them.

The attached VISA allows you to instantly receive any BTC you buy.   It enables this because IF the e-check deduction to your bank doesn't go through, they'll charge your VISA for the amount (since you already have the BTC).
It's pretty clear to me, and I never had to contact them.  I just read their website.


I think you are misunderstanding something.  When you put in a BUY order, you lock in the price you bought it at.  You just don't actually receive the BTC in your Coinbase wallet until after the bank account transaction clears.
The only thing it would "suck" for is if you bought BTC and you wanted to turn around and sell it 2 days later.  You have to wait about 5 days for it to clear before you can move them.

I'm with you OP.  I did the same.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:16:50
On a normal order, I'll round up to the next dollar, then add a dollar.  So if it's 12.35 I'll give them $14.  They are already adding like $2.50 fee for delivery...
