It's called "Ant Farm: A Novel About What's Bugging Society", and I've been describing it as a "fictional" (but familiar) story about a free society that deteriorates into a totalitarian society. And the main characters are ants! Some red, some blue...hint, hint. (And the villains are cockroaches.) In many ways, it's an homage to Orwell's "Animal Farm", but with a very different philosophy.
Like the title says, it doesn't explicitly mention Bitcoin, but it does deal heavily with the perils of fiat currency, and the benefits of currency that is not state-affiliated (like Bitcoin, of which I happen to be a firm advocate).
It just came out on Amazon through a small publisher, but I've put up the first four chapters for free download (as a PDF) here on my website: [ (I'm also trying to get the publisher to start accepting Bitcoin on their website, but they're slow-going - hopefully soon!) Anyway, would love to know what you think of the free chapters (or the full book, if you're so inclined), and happy to answer any questions, if you have some!

I agree. I tried to get my book publisher to accept Bitcoin. She said, "we already accept PayPal," so I said, "some people don't like to use PayPal, and want to pay with Bitcoin instead." That seemed to convince her, but that was very recently, so I guess I'll have to wait and see if she implements it; I'm confident, though.

Thanks! Was asking about PC wallets, as referenced in the title of my thread. :-)

Thanks for the tip! But how does reusing a normal address expose me to security risks? Sorry for the newbie question. :-)

Fair question. It would have been pretty tough to squeeze a Bitcoin story-line into the plot. The characters in the book, and their society, are somewhat primitive - they're tiny little ants, after all (although, they do walk, talk and drive cars, so I guess they're not *that* primitive). Anyway, conceptually, it was easier for me to convey generally that decentralized, non-government issued currency (which Bitcoin happens to be) is preferable to government-run fiat, rather than getting into the nitty gritty of Bitcoin, specifically and explicitly, in a short novel that doesn't even mention the internet. I hope you'll give the free chapters a read - then you'll see what I mean. :)

Ah, sorry!
To clarify, I was referring specifically to the NES Emulator platform that I have running on my PC. ;-)
