No need to sell/send money. Just HODL

need tips on what to do afterwards
trying to get better at HODLing because I usually end of losing significant profit after HODLing for too long

Yes. All capital gains are subject to being taxed. 


That would likely result in an audit by the IRS.

Regardless of how you're cashing out you, a transaction still needs to happen. i.e. you still need to send the bitcoin to gdax in order to sell it. So there's going to be a big transaction fee no matter how you cash out.

stop spreading FUD

Oh shit, so do you mean buying bitcoin from GDAX, keeping it in your GDAX wallet, and then selling it directly from GDAX as well?

I'm not trying to hold, im trying to HODL
completely different concept
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:23:52
True. But if you were to send bitcoin back to GDAX to sell it from there, then you'd have to pay a transaction fee.

Time to realize that Bitcoin has been sub-10k for months now and won’t be going back up?
