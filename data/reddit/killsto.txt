Wow, if this works it will save me a ton of time. I was basically going to create this project when I got time. Thanks!

That's not what I intended but it's not necessarily wrong depending on how you view 'worth'.
It shouldn't be worth more in a BTC/USD sense. It might have more *value* to you because you can have many small transactions instantly without paying nearly as much in transaction fees. In other words, you might be able to get more goods or services for the same amount of BTC on LN - but only if purchases are small in value.
Hope that makes sense!

~~Provided you opened your channel with more funds than you will ever need to spend, maybe.~~ (Edit: Sleep deprivation go the better of me. This was wrong)
It's a bit less secure since your wallet or Bitcoin node will need to monitor the blockchain for malicious broadcasts (ex: Previous state in the channel gets put on the blockchain even though it is invalid) so hopefully your savings would be onchain. A 2-week paycheck should probably be onchain iMO. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:02:38
This is incorrect. It's free (besides on-chain fees for opening/closing channel) to transact over with another party if you have a channel open with them.
Nodes can charge fees for routed payments.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:15:53
Oops, this is correct. Thanks for the correction! I'm lacking on sleep and not quite sure how I came to that thought

I think of it a different way and left some of my thoughts [here]( The main problem with IOUs or check analogy is that you can't spend IOUs or checks right away. You can spend money received by LN on LN immediately. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:53:25
I don't think anybody knows for sure. 
I think your prediction is mostly what many hope for with a couple modifications. The price for on-chain transactions should go down as demand goes down because smaller transactions use LN. Right now the fees are high because demand for onchain transactions is high and the price of bitcoin is high.
Miners may see LN in a negative light because it should lower the demand and fees of on-chain transactions so they get less money. Long-term it should be positive for them because that happening means bitcoin's value should increase as it's adopted.

No. He knew the many of the components of the password (likely because he reuses them with other passwords) so he could limit the dictionary size. A successful brute force attempt without knowing the components is infeasible because the search space is so large. If this is ever not the case then much of cyber security would be broken - it would be a global problem. 
It also wouldn't work on a Ledger Nano because the Ledger signs transactions itself and the private key does not leave the device. The Ledger will reset itself after 3 unsuccessful unlock attempts.
You're more likely to get your coins stolen by misplacing your backup seed.

There needs to be a path of open channels from the other party and you. At a tcp level you only talk to the node you have a channel open with. So to make a payment from A-&gt;B-&gt;C where B is the only node, A and C  only need each other's IPs as long as they have a channel open with B.
For a real example, Starblocks is not a node on [TestNet]( (as of yesterday anyway) and I do not know its IP but I was able to make a payment because I was connected to a node it is connected to.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:14:50
Be careful.
I was stupid and did this a few weeks ago after being awake for over 24 hours. The Ledger Nano S doesn't make you retype the passphrase and only makes you confirm it via a yes/no prompt. After resetting the ledger I don't have access to any funds.
I know what I intended to enter so I must have typod the passphrase initially. I will have to brute force (search space should be small enough) the passphrase once I get some code written to do it. Normal brute-forcing won't work since all passphrase are valid
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:40:21
No, it's a trade-off. The smaller confirmation times means there are more orphaned blocks.
All blockchains have the problem of scale. You either centralize the network to allow larger blocks, keep it decentralized but lose throughput, or implement new protocols that are not currently being done at scale.
If you don't care about decentralization then you can go use a centralized coin until it gets shutdown or censored because it's easy to do. If you do care about decentralization then you need to be patient because these new protocols have never been implemented before.
Have you every experienced bad or buggy software? It was likely made in a hurry or by unskilled developers. You do not want that to happen to your money.

Personally, I agree with you if the status quo continues.
However, I recommend you give lightning network a try on testnet. It shouldn't take you more than a couple hours and may give you hope for the future of Bitcoin.
I still think a crypto currency which distributes some set amount in order to facilitate some sort of Basic Income would be great. In fact, I see that as the only way of ever getting to more fair wealth distribution. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:21:17
It's pretty easy. There are many tricks for memory. Essentially, you 'encode' numbers as items or objects in your head. You can memorize long strings of digits by creating a scene. Humans are much better at memorizing scenes than random text. With the scene memorized, you can decode your password. You should mix this with some other technique so your password isn't only numbers.
I highly recommend the book [Unlimited Memory](  which provides many memory techniques and explains why they work.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:51:00
Provided you have enough funds in a channel for general transacting you may not need to close it for a while.
Some of your paycheck could even be sent over the lightning network if you are getting paid often (every day or even hour worked).
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:53:02
I recommend giving lightning network a try on test net to anyone that thinks this.
No, it doesn't solve scaling right now. But using it first hand makes it apparent that it will make bitcoin usable for nearly any size of transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:13:09
I hope it is since I've been using electrum in an attempt to recover it. I tested with a 2nd passphrase using the same seed and it worked. However, it didn't work with Electrum-LTC. Electrum states it may not fully support BIP39 in the future so it's possible it isn't working for my passphrase (but I doubt this is the case)
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:37:49
I think most people agree that the blocksize will need to increase even with LN. After all, it states that in the LN whitepaper.
It doesn't need to be done immediately however. 
One thing to think about is that LN nodes should be easy and cheap to operate in order to have a competitive and decentralized network. Today, raising the block size might not make the bitcoin network much more centralized. However, raising the blocksize might actually hurt LN because nodes because there is an even greater need to distribute the blockchain on when LN starts being used.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:16:41
No, just math.
How would it know that the recovered key is the 'correct' key? What if you had to replace your Ledger Nano S? Or simply have multiple wallets (which you should because hopefully you use a passphrase)
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:43:39
Yup, that's what I usually do. Either thought I did but didn't or just decided to skip it out of sleepiness this time :\. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:08:32
Not necessarily. A frugal person could 'afford' $20,000 on a risky investment even if it is most of his funds.
It is not recommended, but his argument could be that he doesn't need the money and is okay with the risk of not having money in retirement.
And a believer in Bitcoin wouldn't be doing it for fiat gains anyway. 
Edit: I suppose everyone has different definitions of wealth. I assumed OP meant 'not needing to worry about money every' wealth.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:40:56
Then help speed development up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:31:20
Yeah, the fees are pretty high right now and it's unfortunate. 
But either help to fix the problem or switch to the other decentralized  currency and secure currency you think has already solved the scaling problem long-term. It isn't any one person's responsibility to fix the problem. It is everyone's.
There are people working on it. They are just too busy working and not marketing on reddit.
