People lose/damage their phones all the time and they don't want to keep thousands on such a device. Asking them to store a recovery phrase may work for some but most will lose their phrase or even copy it down wrong.
Fact is, people will trust an FDIC insured bank over their own security measures. This trust is rock solid for common people and won't dissolve until bank runs start. This type of trust also extends to the crypto world as a lot of people have no problem leaving money in solutions like Coinbase.

I am not sure what you mean. If you hold coins yourself you are still subject to 15% cap gains tax if/when you convert to fiat.
I think it's smart to hold some yourself but if you can build up to about 10 BTC or more and leave it in a Roth IRA for retirement...you'd be very well off. I'm personally waiting for the ETF to do this. You could argue that this wont be necessary if bitcoin hits 5+ figures since almost everyone should be willing to accept bitcoin over fiat at that point. Or you can renounce US citizenship...

I guess banks will be failing left and right. OR, a smart contract can be created to hold my funds in Bank 1 until my loan is repaid. Not sure how feasible that is...

No, I think you bring up a good point but is there really any point in categorizing the [stats]( [This article]( touches on woman's retirement planning and how much more conservative they are. Rich, Average or Poor...women being risk-adverse appears to be human nature. There are other examples where this is true outside of finances.
As others have pointed out, there's nothing restricting them from the technical aspects so bringing awareness to BTC in hopes to close the wealth gap (and hopefully bring more economic power) is really the only thing that makes sense to me.

He has stated that he will stand trial if Sweden guarantees not to extradite him to the USA. To no one's surprise, they will not make this guarantee.
Now, remember when NO ONE in the EU would allow the Pres of Bolivia to land his plane (for fuel) because they thought Assange was aboard? Eventually the Pres had to give in an land under the condition that they search the plane. Assange was not aboard.  
This shows you the level of influence that the US has over basically everyone but a few nations. This is shows you why Assange would be fearful of extradition, but most importantly, unlawful detainment without trial. I hope you read what they did to Bradley Manning, then you'd realize why Snowden is in Russia. The United States often digs up a case for sexual assault (or some sort of sexual deviancy) toward anyone who challenges them, there is clear precedence. I'd imagine they do this because it is an act that everyone would abhor. A classic, yet effective, smear campaign.
Now, with some facts, you'll see that it is HIGHLY LIKELY that these sexual assault charges are a ploy to get him under custody of a US-friendly country for extradition.

Exchanges are overwhelming to the casual user. When someone sees terms like "margin trading", "stop loss", "market limit"...their eyes gloss over.
I should rephrase, Brokers (like Coinbase, Circle, Snapcard, etc) are integral to mainstream adoption. These brokers make it very easy to setup ACH transfers (something people are already used to with Venmo and PayPal) and have very simple apps and sites that streamline the fiat to BTC conversion. You're right in that no one source will make or break Bitcoin but Coinbase is so easy (wallet interface) and has a proven track record. This is important to casual users. If you can't see that then I don't know what to tell you.

@_date: 2016-01-07 00:07:45
In my experience, that is incorrect.
I don't know about BTC to BTC trades but with BTC to FIAT, I noticed there are fewer buyers on a day with over 2-3% increase. I assume they are waiting for a dip or at least sideways momentum before buying.

People who've managed to position themselves to be able to make a living off of Bitcoin can attest to delays and how the delays have cost them potential earnings.
People who simply hodl and occasionally transfer coins between wallets will naturally assume nothing is wrong.

By settle do you mean, confirmation? 1 confirmation often takes longer than 10 minutes. And with most organizations requiring at least 2 confirmations, this whole "10 minute" talking point looks a bit disingenuous.

Of course, that's exactly how it is for crypto to crypto. BUT, most crypto users who look to convert FIAT to crypto will run into regulation. This is the way of the world you live in. If your country doesn't regulate then good for you.
There are many ways to buy coins, you don't need to go thru a regulated exchange. Gemini is actually great and I'm sure anyone who uses them for large buys/day trading will attest. If you are making large buys, you should have a utility bill. If you day trade, you have a utility bill (internet/power). If you at least have a car, you have a utility bill (insurance). If none of this is available then I question your priorities.
If you're in the $5-$500 buy range then use Coinbase, Circle, Snapcard, LBC, Bitquick, Paxful...I can go on. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 23:19:30
I know the tech but in reality, confirmations often take longer than 10 minutes.  
In my opinion, 10 minutes is an eternity in internet communication. Under 10 mili-seconds should be the goal.

I think it does actually. If implemented properly, we could see a huge wave of adoption because the reality is, EVERYONE is on YT. 
The more casual users who can experience/get comfortable with BTC, the better. Let it be the stepping stone to that bitcoin powered stream site (i forget the name).

I doubt "the powers at be" are accumulating BTC. It's an infant currency, they can't control it and it's not ready for primetime. The FED will QE, lie, cheat, steal then finally GO TO WAR before they give up full reserve status.
I've been watching the movements of BRICS nations. I'm fairly certain they are carefully moving away from the dollar and to something else. This new reserve may or may not (gold-backed) be fiat but I highly doubt they'd do all this positioning just to support bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-07-24 14:56:45
Honestly, I doubt it happens because it seems like China is positioning for a Gold-Backed Yuan or some type of BRICS currency.
However, there's also the fact that BTC is programmable and 10-15 years is a ridiculously long time in Tech. We could just as well see changes that allow BTC to be used as a world reserve currency. Realistically, this would require completely innovative economics.
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:24:05
I think you underestimate the number of people using PayPal/Venmo. "Just Venmo me" is a common phrase out here in California. 
Supporting Bitcoin would spend up adoption from what I can see. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 17:56:03
100 is way too low. Even if it were to drop that low, it would most likely shoot back up before you noticed and got a chance to buy. You could put your money in an exchange and set a buy at 100 but good luck with that.
No one can give you an accurate price point. Because no one knows. Id buy 2-5k worth now or at the next dip into the 360s. Then weekly 1k buys.

One of the biggest problems with the current BTC "community" is a lot of users think the public is just as smart as them.
"why cant i just buy a RPi2 and make my own 21inc BTC comp???"

You're unnecessarily hostile.
A strong 80% of people in the world will need a trusted brand/entity before getting into BTC. They need someone to make it easy. If Banks can do that and the public can verify holdings then there is no issue with Banks being involved with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:26:26
No. Because this isn't about me. I'm sure we share similar views but I won't bother typing them out.
I will say, I just spoke with a rep from Bank Of America about bitcoin in a meeting. The rep knew of the tech but doesn't own any ("...yet" he added). I bring this up because he mentioned ways that Banks can benefit from BTC. This combined with actually trying to explain BTC to regular people has influenced me to consider ways that could ease the transition from Fiat Banking to BTC Banking. I suggest you keep an open mind.
@_date: 2015-11-02 23:00:56
every time the price rises, dudes come out the woodwork with elaborate formulas and theories explaining how BTC will blow up.

If you make a purchase of something priced in bitcoin with bitcoin, you should only have to pay sales tax. Capital Gains should only be charged when converting (or selling) bitcoin for fiat. Not a fact, just my opinion but it would be nice if the Gov. confirmed this.

I finally saw it. 3 things.
Bitcoin is mentioned positively in the first scene. The Mom's response to the main character's description is the average real-world response. BTC has a long way to go. Also, It's naive to think that drug sales won't be the popular use case in movies when in reality it is, currently, the most applicable use case. 
I thought the movie was entertaining. If you are looking for depth then why are you watching a mainstream hollywood production to begin with?
I think this will be the first of many films where bitcoin plays a predominant role. Look for Sci-Fi films to take a more meaningful stab at it in the future.
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:38:53
I don't particularly care to be honest. clearly has thought this through at a much deeper level than myself.

I agree but this could also be why Wall Street is picking up it's pace with industry-grade exchanges. They may see bitcoin for it's store of value trait during the crash.

Ha! the librarian slant of this sub is a bit unrealistic at times. Everything in life has standards. 
I remember a month ago or so the BTC foundation made it public that Circle had yet to implement some form of web security. They eventually updated. That was a good thing IMO. I am in no way suggesting that I have the answers for something like this but a healthy discussion should foster. Not useless, sarcastic remarks.

@_date: 2015-03-16 21:43:49
yea i get that but not everyone can/wants to be a lone wolf. some people would rather have others handle things. There are numerous examples of this (coinbase, web hosting companies, email hosting, cloud storage, etc). 
Despite the downvotes, my point still stands. I wish there was a more realistic view of how laymen will utilize BTC and how they COULD be protected without completely losing all the benefits of the technology. Again, I do not have all the answers but some guidelines should be laid down.
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:04:36
Yea. There's really no excuse in today's Information Age. That post where the guy on Tinder asked women about BTC was great but it showed many are content taking a "wait and see" approach or even just staying ignorant. This doesn't just apply to women but everyone. I understand it, in fact i think it's natural but I will not shed a tear should BTC take off and people are unprepared.

The very same reasons that encourage men. I believe one could argue men have less aversion toward risk compared to women. This would be the wall women themselves need to overcome. This applies to many things (traditional stocks, extreme sports, etc) in addition to BTC.
