Hate to see what happens to alts if bitcoin tanks to under 10 and stays there.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:40:57
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:10:05
What would happen to the miners if all the smaller transactions with higher fees are done on the lightning network instead.  Seems the miners will be pushed to negative profits?  Wouldnt that lead to the collapse of the whole system?  Basically bitcoin to zero if there are 0 miners left? R/bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:56:22
Seems a little late to implement.  Better sooner than never.  Wonder how high it will go once lightning goes live.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:15:54
Thank you!  Clears up some stuff.  So transaction fees are a small part of the miners fees and even if miners left bitcoin it would auto adjust to profitability.  Interesting info!
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:54:50
Nope does not solve huge amounts of energy being used to mine bitcoin.  The fees pay for the energy used and more.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:23:50
How exactly will this solve the problem of high fees?  The math doesnt work.  Hate to break it to everyone.  The fees will remain high.  Bitcoin is not an efficient coin to lower fees....  mining costs huge amounts of money...  show me the math if you think otherwise.. 
@_date: 2019-07-28 17:56:57
What does this represent?  U say that's u in 5 years?  Meaning your going to build a bunker under your house.  U Mexican?  Also along with the bunker a spaceship?  With a bitcoin symbol on it representing what?  In 5 years your gonna get on a spaceship and send a giant bitcoin logo into space?

@_date: 2019-10-24 08:41:30
Yup look at the trading volumes.  Dumpcity coming...  thinking heavy seller action will outweigh the buys and kill the coin shortly.
@_date: 2019-08-16 04:57:54
Seen it less than a dollar
@_date: 2019-08-16 02:33:43
When it was at 3k it was a buy.  6 months of up momentum and only a fool would invest in bitcoin now.  But there r plenty of fools who will buy at ath lol.  Makes me wonder what people r looking at to make buy and sell decisions.  Charts r everywhere maybe have a look once ina while lol.
@_date: 2019-08-16 09:29:38
They r the ones that lost money and hate bitcoin.  Period.
@_date: 2019-02-17 07:56:41
Lol, we never had a real use for gold until recently.  Why did we move mountains to get a little bit of useless gold.  Someone explain why we would do these things for useless gold.   Why have we fought and killed for this metal?  A metal that is useful only in a technological age.

This picture is way off.  Cost to buy 50 dollars in bitcoin, 5 dollars minimum.  Then u transfer with a cost.  Then what r u gonna buy with the bitcoin.  Nothing.  You have to convert it again to fiat.  Can someone explain to everyone how stupid bitcoin is????
@_date: 2019-12-20 14:15:16
Is called coinbase, glad all i hear is crickets, means most of u have smartened up.  Let bitcoin go to zero.  Save ur dollars you will never get rich off bitcoin.  Of course its gonna get pumped and dumped for the next few years and prices will go up and down..  go invest in real investments.  Im calling a 1 dollar or less bitcoin within 10 years.
Im calling a 1 dollar or less bitcoin within 10 years.Im calling a 1 dollar or less bitcoin within 10 years.  Really i tjink it will be sub penny status per bitcoin lol....  imagine 10 bitcoins for a penny....
@_date: 2019-12-07 01:35:38
Rich retard, think coinbase holds about 1000 bitcoins
@_date: 2019-12-20 12:26:52
No it compares more to blu ray vs the other format that i cant even remember the name of.  Fiat will be converted to electronic format sooner than later.  So if fiat also becomes electronic.  No paper bills printed or very few.  Similar to bitcoin and the rest.  Whats the need for bitcoin?  U think governments will allow this?  Would take ww3 to break the hold they have over us already.

Cup handle forming reversal soon to break out?  Or is it gonna crash and burn??  Handle has stayed within 50 percent...  could this be a breakout soon???
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:58:48
Lol shows what this place is about.  Shitcoin is doing what its supposed to.  Buncha hodlers gonna start jumpin up and down if it breaks 10k again.  
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:51:43
Hard to believe anyones gonna wait for the transaction to clear for a cup o coffee.  If fees r way down to somewhere at 1 percent how about the speed of the transaction today?  A few weeks ago ot was somewhere between 1 to 2 hours to clear.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:15:41
Doesnt work if the price dips below that price.  Dont u think thats what what done?  As it moves down his limit will slowly move with it.  Obviously he had to move a large volume quickly.  
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:02:21
Hodl like a dumbass lol
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:48:29
Pump and dump!! lol...  buy the dip!!  Lol...  hodl!!  Lol...  any more suckers left??
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:28:05
They make millions off transaction fees.  Why would they screw around with your digital coins?  Not saying they dont or wont or haven't done so.  I'm just saying now a days things r being watched.  Not regulated.  But if someone suspects fraud and can prove it I'd suspect shit to go down.  Exchanges being shut down.  Kinda opposite what an exchange would want in the golden age of crypto...
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:31:34
You dont lose shit lol blah blah blah yeah you lost money ypu dont care about lol...  you lost your money it was too easy for me to take it lol
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:39:29
8 seems to be the key to the last drop off..  id expect 8 and down, maybe some sideways at 6 for a while if it gets bad imo...  if it goes to 4 and 2 which i think is its true price id be surprised..
@_date: 2019-01-06 08:19:06
So sell my house and cash my investments for bitcoin?  Lol.  Not really great advice, I'd leave the advising to qualified financial advisors..  crypto is for a small percentage of your investment money...
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:11:57
Thats why it just went up, big fish have no mercy lol
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:10:47
Already done
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:16:50
Sellers will dump then wait for the price to rise and dump it.  Then repeat as many times possible.  You dip buyers r what sellers love
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:11:51
Bet on what?  Your stupidity?  The way you type everything you think is hilarious.  Is that the way thoughts run thru your mind?  Lol
How about 100 000 btc ok?  Actually lets bet a zillion btc that your a complete retard ok?  
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:12:14
Lol thats a good idea.  Also dont forget we r kinda past the will it work stage and have watched bitcoin sit on its hands while other supposedly shitcoins upgraded to things like lightning network.
In tech upgrades must happen fast like u see with computer components.  Or u get left behind.
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:54:13
Lol why do newbies always think they r instant financial advisors?  
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:21:55

The herd is feeling a rebound id bet monday.  Never go with the herd.

2000 or less
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:19:31
Seems the regulations r killing bitcoin slowly.  In canada and my bank has blocked crypto purchases.  I cant buy it easily except at high priced atms or other high priced voucher to bitcoin things.  Cant spent if you cant buy.

@_date: 2018-02-20 15:09:33
2nd layer lighting type stuff should solve this.  Most small trans going on lightning network.  Im surprised bitcoin has upgraded so quickly after not upgrading for so long.  
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:51:03
You diehards remind me of this dumbass who thinks he knows everything and walks around telling everyone to buy bitcoin and cannabis stocks...  too funny how everyone who dont know shit thinks they r financial advisors
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:38:30
Yup its funny, when btc is at 4000 up from 2000 you will see the same memes
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:37:53
Nah i let you hodl
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:36:46
Since your obviously newbie heres what you need to do.  Depends where you live.  First you need to find an exchange online that will allow you to withdraw fiat to your debit or visa card.  You will need to verify your identity with them before being allowed to wifhdraw fiat.  Read their rules and get verified BEFORE you transfer your coin to that exchange.  
After your verified at the level you need to withdraw fiat transfer your coin to that exchange and sell you btc for your fiat.  Then withdraw to your card of choice.
Problem is you made 50 dollars.  Every step costs you percentages.  Transfer.  Sell btc.  Withdraw( big percent).  Your left maybe 25 dollar profit.  Id advise you wait.  It either u lose some or win some.  As it stands you havent moved enough to justify withdrawal unless you need the 500 now and were just lucky you didnt lose anything.
Good luck!  I dont advocate hodling but in your case its prob best.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:09:58
Would be nice for a lot of people.  Im not invested in crypto at the moment .  I was before.  Didnt seem deserving at 19 so i shorted and closed shorts after makin a bit.  Too much hype lately always points to the south.  No news is good news for bitcoin..  
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:46:42
first post sorry.  cant edit it now.
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:56:28
Moment of silence for the other half of the money you lost in a month.  And thats after it recovered 40 percent.  Now wheres it gonna drop to..  ill enjoy your statments when it tanks again and it recovers to 7000...  hodl cause it just went up from 3000 to 7000 yippee!!  More than doubled!!!  Lol...
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:36:19
Whilst lolol
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:18:29
Look at the charts, try a 1 day candlestick.  Steady decline since december and the current drop off is pretty much inline with the past 2 months.  Dont need warren buffet to make this call..  it just did exactly what the charts are sayin it should do...  inline with the past 2 months...  its you hodlers who need to wake up..
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:18:52
 If someone is long and they decide thats wrong and go short is kinda obvious that they would close the long position and go short.
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:45:20
Wow im scared of being put on your ignore list.  Up there with dying and hodling bitcoin/losing money
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:06:00
Should stabilize around 2k to 3k lol
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:37:38
Ok geeza, didnt u read the post where u dont lose shit wah wah wah.  Bitcoin diehards gonna diebroke..
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:43:06
Damn so you hodled from 20k to now?  Trying not to lol
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:31:11
Lol your basically calling buffett a criminal.  Not true.  Follow his direction.  It does look like the tide is turning...  also btc could be 1000 usd in the near future as well lol...  who the hell knows...  which is driving the price even lower.  Fact is buffett said btc is crap.  Find your new coin to shill..
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:16:49
Not possible.  Have a look at the order book.  U need to sell it down to that price through volume which didnt happen.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:40:01
If its was that easy to make money everone would be rich.  Making money means taking it from someone else.  
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:56:45
Gotta be the smartest post ive read in this bitcoin diehard thread lol...  bye bye bitcoin...  
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:47:35
If you gonna start now id put the money into an exchange and place a really low buy.  Like how low you think bitcoin could go in the next 4 months and go even lower to account for fear.   Wait it out....  you might get lucky....  is the way to play bitcoin...  sometimes it flash crashes to zero....
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:52:19
Lol bitcoins recovery is the weakest ive ever seen it recover from.  Trying to put a positive spin on that recovery is futile.  Invest wisely not blindly.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:12:18

Isnt the end of the world.  U guys r hilarious.  Even 6 k i wouldnt b that worried if i was hodling.  Im actually expecting a 6k price in about 6 months.
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:43:21
Is correct.  Quantum computers dont exist and imo prob never will.  Worrying about crypto will be the last problem the world is gonna have to solve if quantum comp are developed.  Lol.    Imagine how sought after this machine would be...
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:29:39
U dont get rich by not listening to warren buffet either.  Id rather keep my money than lose it all by going against a warren buffet call.  If the man says its crap its crap.

@_date: 2018-04-02 23:50:14
I know japan.  I know that people wont be buying bitcoin at the moment cause its going down or sideways.  Sure when its going up people will take a loss for the potential extra they will have.  Its not that way anymore.  People are dumb but not that dumb.

Lol can you invest so the hodlers can hang onto some shred of hope.  Wheres all the hodler memes now???  Cant stand ignorance advising other ignorant people on investments... now people hodling onto their mortgages and cars they gonna lose...  cryptolife cryptodeath more like it lol...  whos investing??  Please????  Tear.  haha...
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:06:42
If they were buyers it would be insider trading.  So you dont know what exactly they gonna do other than enter the space.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:54:47
Another point for shitcoin.  Unpredictable transaction fees and slow transactions.
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:04:09
Buy 250 worth of bitcoin only.  Buy what you can afford to lose.  
Why bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:08:17
I would compare costs.  If your debit charges extra its prob still inline with the fees associated with bitcoin.  Not to mention the extra time and effort finding atms or anyone who accepts it.  Still in its infancy stage imo.  
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:00:43
Yeah i dunno whos who in terms of the best just took the 2 biggest bitcoins....  they all suck lol..  got my eyes and money on diet bitcoin.  Laugh now but you will cry later lol..

Lol funniest comment ive read here and i dont think you were even trying to be funny.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:59:33
Blockstream and lightning are not coins.  Id say bitcoin cash is microsoft and bitcoin gold is apple.  Now if bitcoin would get off its hands and start trail blazing like it should be i might have a different opinion of the team.  As of now they r on the shitlist and couldnt care less about bitcoin.  You all been pumped and dumped.  Wake up before its too late!!
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:39:55
Blockchain is the future.  To think bitcoin will be the main coin in the future is laughable.  It wouldnt be able to handle worldwide adoption.  There are far cheaper coins that could potentially be that coin but its not bitcoin.  
Only thing keeping bitcoin from zero is the fact that its paired on exchanges as the base currency meaning you must buy btc to buy another coin.  This wont last long i guarantee.
To say btc is the internet of money is a joke.  Another pump and dump for you hodlers lolollol...  you think media is guiding you in the right direction?  Lolol...
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:26:34
Just a joke dont be offended.  Yes the USA does take the cake.  How about 9/11.  Like some kind of modern day human sacrifice.
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:20:06
Not really.  The whale just needs to push it up till the shorts start liquidating.  Its a snowball from there.  Once it hits its peak the whale will sell it back down to just above his buy price.  Done.  Screwed many little guys and made a huge profit easy.
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:21:21
All the suckers
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:28:57
Warren Buffet also said bitcoin is crap so its funny your trying to take his advise and not take his advice at the same time.
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:30:41
2k if it does a 90 percent correction like it did before.  Quite the media shitstorm lately..
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:43:47
Im sure no ones gonna go to the trouble converting their fiat which is already spendable anywhere into an unspendable bitcoin.  You make no sense.
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:39:01
You will feel so free when you live on the street and very equal to the other bitcoin hodlers living in the box beside you.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:12:52
Yup only takes a 60 percent drop for bitcoin team to do something.  Finally fixed a small problem..  Great work for a team of monkeys.  Humans not so much..  good luck with that team behind bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:57:55
Depends what company bitcoin is.  Imo its like commodore 64, no upgrades.  Id say falling is right.  Which coin is microsoft like?  Which one is apple?  
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:40:09
Smart money buys when everyone else is scared.  Good buy imo.  Although if you were to hold for the long term have you looked at bitcoin sv?
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:37:54
Since that's what the world expects.  I'm sure that's what's gonna happen lol...  expect the unexpected...
@_date: 2018-12-16 09:38:21
Fall for what shit?  You dont think a small investment into sv is a smart move?  Sv is at 70 usd.  I'll write it here so we can look back at who's smart and who's dumb.
Let's have a quick look at sv atm.  Just cause I'm a nice guy.  I use poloniex so that's where I take my data from.  
Atm sv sits at number 2 in volume in btc trading pair and usdc.  Pretty interesting fact.  Number 2 in volume.  What's that tell you guys?
