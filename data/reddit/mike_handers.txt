Well duh, I'm new and even I know that you don't sell right now. You wait. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:33:31
Oh god, I want a bitcoin scientist, someone's who's word I can trust and can explain the reasoning behind it. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:11:57
Can you explain duplicate coin money? That sounds, crazy? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:31:21
Alright, I'm getting it. So you get all the little transactions, somehow resend yourself all that money as 1 transaction, then cash out, want you want to cash out. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:34:17
What's BCH? and loaded? I don't understand.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:35:59
It seems there's a lot of debate over segwit. Is it really that bad/good? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:10:40
A super miner. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:02:49
See, I'm a smart guy but define consolidate in this form. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:43:29
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:47:34
Iv e seen a LOT of arguments against it. I don't understand them per se. But is there merit in that argument? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:49:43
Why and a Trezor? Can I move between the wallets? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:33:28
Read this:
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:17:34
I agree up till the debt, you don't really own it if you're paying a debt off although it does raise of your quality of life. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:08:18
Man I don't think i can explain it but bitcoin is specifically set up so that a majority doesn't have total control.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:54:20
man you might want to add a /s ha.
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:25:40
Has your question been answered yet? Because if not, show them the 20 minute video in the FAQ and say "It's essentially the stock market, I traded my stock in a company early, i got tge stock from a friend" etc etc
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:07:55
time the market means to constantly try to buy low, sell high, repeat. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:16:56
Sure, bitcoin is only as useful as long as people use it. A strong propaganda could hurt it if literally no one uses it. But eh. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:11:53
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. 
1. read the sticky. 
2. A cryptocurrency, ie, like dollars but better and online. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:56:25
like what? I need food and rent. Not that I've made any bitcoin yet or any money and oh God I'm so poor. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:50:36
yay, if it triples I'll have 12 extra dollars. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:38:30
Well where is steam pulling from? I'm a newb but on mycellium it'll tell me the confirmations. What did you use? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:56:42
I'm new and I completely did not understand your second paragraph. 
But yeah the biggest reason I can think of is a lot of people freak when it goes down and security is up to you alone.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:11:20
I be poor. I cant afford that. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:33:39
This is just gonna be my next 12 hours, learning about bitcoin. Watching your videos now. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:37:33
That's about 200 years in the future minimum.
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:32:09
the fuck are packets. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:23:14
I like you. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:08:57
maybe don't? I gave coin base my card and bought it and done. boom. Like buying anything else. I'm like 90% sure it didn't require ID verification
Why you should trust it? I only have 2 anecdotal experiences. 1. everyone seems to trust it. 2. When I called my bank to confirm the woman gave some tips about bitcoin and says she sees coin base frequently. 
All I got. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:43:54
I do not care. That wasn't the question. The question was "Is there a point of no return?" 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:06:23
Sir, being in debt and broke *sounds* poor. but i dont know the guy. if you give a poor person 10 million, theyll usually have nothing within a year. They think they'll lose it so they spend it. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:04:31
newb here, how does this affect me? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:59:00
Good question, contact an accountant.
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:52:14
Well Mr. CockRampageIsHere, maybe he isn't the only one who needs to control themselves a little.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:51:24
poor, the answer is poor. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:36:17
I literally don't understand. 
How can you have a lot of input addresses? Unless you mean hes transferring $5 $5 $5, etc and it's feeing him per transaction. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:42:51
Sounds like it'd be easier via our addresses. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:53:26
When? They ask very scammy questions and info. What should I use? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:27:39
ironic name. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:39:04
no. He be screwed. 
Almost guaranteed but I guess it depends, but I think anyone needs more than "lost my account" to help him. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:20:02
Not relevant. That does not answer my question.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:49:17
way to scare me gallowboob. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:27:10
As a new comer, thank you, getting through a certain wave of hostility was kinda hard. 
I'm trying to read and learn but it's kinda intensive. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:02:00
all news kinda is.
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:37:24
yeah but how likely is it that our plane will be shot down? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:41:57
Can I have some help please? because you just described me.
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:24:32
5$ fee? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:51:21
I give up, this is clearly a program directory and i see the day difference and I understand nothing. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:22:10
gotcha. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:36:39
The FAQ bitcoin 101 video, show that, it helped me a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:19:08
I understand but not how this caused people to feel panic and then nothing ever again. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:43:43
Gonna take some great concepts and shove it down into a few words. 
"The best time to buy bitcoin was the past. Second best time is now" 
Bitcoin is showing all the signs of going up. I'd suggest it. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:06:43
see ya in 5 years
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:52:34
teach me oh wise one
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:30:46
Is it free somewhere? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:58:23
depends on person, ex grew up poor and she explained that any money she felt she *needed* to spend it before it was gone, or taken from her or etc. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:52:27
This is sufficiently confusing. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:13:23
I dont see etherum or altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:24:44
that place is shit isn't? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:05:12
there's a 40 minute video on wallets by someone practicing bitcoin for 4 years. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:29:10
Wow, i didn't know today was the day I lose interest in Forbes who can't take 15 minutes to research.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:53:37
Well their not *wrong*.
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:58:32
100% do not listen to this guy. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:19:00
awwwwwww, I had a fucking 35% fee on my 10 bucks. 
Question, any other software updates coming? How do I learn about them?
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:39:52
it already is I'm afraid. 
Hold On for Dear Life 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:27:16
if you sold the bitcoin, which use to be worth 10, it would now be worth 900, is what i got.
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:18:44
A. trust and time. 
B. could happen
What I mean by trust is only now am i getting into bitcoin but I've known about it for a while. There's many many many people that have no idea what a cryptocurrency is OR what bitcoin is, but have heard the name. 
I don't see any other currency getting as popular for regular people that use only Facebook and Yahoo. (like most of my family and they're friends) 
So there's time, next is just trust. Bitcoin has been around the longest and thus it's the first and even if something better comes along, we've seen those 2 things beat out tech in the past. (Certain game systems. one to mind). 
And all that said, another currency could come out and wipe tge floor with it, nothing is certain.
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:10:08
O.k. stupid ass question, why should i do those 3 things?
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:25:14
So what wallet do I get if I want to get bitcoin on my phone and computer?
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:05:40
Yes, it helps the network, a lot. 
Imagine small miners that are influencable (not hacked, just changing) but BitCore is completely 100% original Bitcoin and won't be having none of your shit. They're like paladins to our DPS. 
But they're intense. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:35:09
Sure, I don't trust them but for turning bitcoins into money I also know of kraken/Glidera (same thing) and that's all the experts have suggested to me so far. Glidera felt, well, poorly designed. 
Also, sidebar, there a link to more converters. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:23:54
Man, imagine this: colonies need a system of money. Imagine that, bitcoin for tge mars colonies.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:48:50
Doesn't this incentivize being paid in large amounts and fuck with someone being paid 2, 3, 5 dollars at a time? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:16:09
Rule 8. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:22:20
not wrong but difficult. Even if (and this would HAVE to happen) all bitcoin sites were strangled and amendments and laws were passed globally, that de-centralized isnt a joke. It's impossible to kill. Only to wound.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:45:49
Man addresses are the one thing that trick me up. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:02:52
As the other guy said, if you're in the U.S. you have to tell the IRS about loss and gain IF you convert it to government currency. Like dollars, euro's, etc. And maybe for larger capital such as a house or car. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:09:25
I be poor my friend. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:17:04
That's a bit much to buy, you know that right? Maybe you should start a tad smaller? 
but your money, the right sidebar has a lot of myths disproven and there's the FAQ, etc etc. 
Legitmately the only reasons you shouldn't is 2 things. If you don't have enough security (which is on you) you may end up fucked. 
And it will go down and up and down price exchange wise.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:55:04
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:49:19
*psst* can I get some for some basic neccesites? You know like student debt, a house, a statue of a bitcoin, you know the basics. 
In all seriousness, good for you. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:51:11
RemindMe! 6 Months
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:08:25
That's short sighted. 
"call me when the internet can do this and then I'll call it important" okay? All evidence so far points to that trajectory. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:47:14
A lack of knowledge in a subject happens to us all.
