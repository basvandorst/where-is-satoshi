Deciding whether to sell the coins I have in cold storage or not and buying them back at a discount...

I feel like it's going to be rough weeks ahead. I'm worried what China will do once they wake up and see the price dropped $100 while they were asleep.

Show proof of the transaction. Otherwise this is just a bs post.

OK thank you for all the help! Might end up getting a Trezor, we'll see. :)

Ok so the watch only account is just to see that the coins are still in there. Does that mean every time you log in to your electrum account there's a slight chance of it being compromised? How does that work exactly - wouldn't they still need your seed and password?

Thank you for the great reply! So when I send from Electrum, the funds will come from the pool of btc from all the received addresses? Also, do I need to create a watch-only wallet? I'm still not sure what exact purpose it serves. Am I just as secure if I just use one wallet? I don't intend on receiving/sending much.

At least it's going up since I last checked. $580 - $600.

It's people like you that make the market profitable. Buy high sell low baby!

Is this guy a long-term bear on btc? 
@_date: 2016-06-11 03:17:31
What does Electrum do that makes it more secure? Thx

I believe in the fat man.

Was your 2fa setup through your email? They must have gotten access to your email account which had your address and 2fa etc.

Thank you for the reply. What's the best way to secure my blockchain?
