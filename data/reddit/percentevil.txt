Trading is about good risk management not about predicting price direction.  Traders who have excellent risk management can be wrong about price direction 70+% of the time and still make a killing.  We think in terms of risk / reward not in terms of $ amount of a swing.

Local bitcoins is the answer imo, Coinbase may be on of the largest exchanges in the US but they will not be the place where the world buys its bitcoin.  It's just the place where most of the US buys it.  Ultimately the US users are the least in need of Bitcoin right now other than for speculative purchases.  The rest of the world will catch up.

Halving the block reward doesn't equate to doubling existing supply, it slows the overall inflationary rate (ie new coins minted into the system)  If purchasing demand remains steady and half the amount of new coins are minted each day, price should rise in a more elevated fashion after the halving occurs.  Though in practice price tends to begin rising months before the event occurs as a method of pricing in the eventual shorter supply.

Economies are built on savings and investment not spending, debt and credit.  That latter is what destroys healthy economies and puts us in the situation we are today.  Keynesian economists would have you believe that inflation is required for the exact reasons you stated above but it's a fallacy.  To argue that no one would ever spend a deflationary currency is to argue that human beings don't have to eat, or drink water or have clothes and shelter.  We would spend but we would spend at a responsible rate that more accurately represents our current need vs our long term goals.  In a credit ridden inflationary environment as we have today no one considers savings and investment a prudent idea, after all why would they?  Why would they save for the new house / the new car that they want when they can just go into massive debt and get it right now.  Human beings will always prefer to have now what they could save for and have later.  And governments will always prefer a printable currency that they can inflate into oblivion to pay for their massively indebted wars and social programs.  Eventually this comes to a head, and i believe this is what your seeing right now.  The people of the world want out of the currency wars, they want out of the printing bonanza and they want out of seeing the value of their currencies plummet year after year Bitcoin can do that for them, and so long as it continues to do that they will continue to divest from the classical Keynesian global economic system.

I'm sorry to hear this man, I'm sure it's very tough for you.  I just wanted to post a related message to the community given how much price talk has been around lately.  Money isn't everything.  It's a famous enough saying but people ignore it all the time.  We're shown images everyday of rich people and we all wonder what it would be like to have that kind of power / capability to do whatever we want whenever we want but keep in mind plenty of people who have a lot of money / fame / celebrity are miserable.  Depression doesn't discriminate via your bank account.  Focus on friends and family, find something / someone you care about and lose yourself in it, it will prove far more rewarding in the long run.  Those of us who get too caught up in getting rich do so at the expense of the most important things in life.  Don't end up a miser alone in your mansion with only your piles of cash to comfort you.  Or worse end up taking your own life.   Best wishes to the OP and his family.

Yah I was going to add this before I read your comment.  In my mind the most likely outcome is a no contest decision which would auto-approve the ETF structure.  The SEC has far more to lose by approving then denying the ETF should it turn out to be a fiasco, but there is industry demand for this product.  Letting it slide through with a no-contest is probably the best move politically.

This sounds like the method I will use, although I am curious what factors you take into consideration when calculating current probability of failure.. I am assuming there are quite a few, I think the best I could do is estimate grossly. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:03:15
I agree that Bitcoin does not currently function well as a transactional currency due mainly to the block size limitation.  However my main argument is that this issue will in time be resolved by the core team and we should not as a community be rash in handing over control of the project to a small, untested group of developers who arguably seek to centralize control.  This process would destroy the other beneficial aspects of Bitcoin and then ultimately Bitcoin itself.  Ideas, developers and code are already working toward resolving the full blocks with projects like segwit and lightning network.  Yes, perhaps not as fast as they could or should have but nonetheless it is in progress.  It is quite arguable that this process would have occurred much faster without the unlimited teams involvement in the issue honestly.
@_date: 2017-03-26 07:37:33
Yes I agree.  I think the Unlimited community appears more sizable than it is due largely to the degree of funding and campaigning from group leaders.
In fact I'm not sure how much stock I put in the likelihood of a fork at all.  Theres a few different factors at play that from afar appear to be closely allied and powerful, however when pressured I believe they will break apart into distinct and separate groups.  
**Roger Ver**  
I actually have a lot in common philosophically with Ver.  We are both Voluntarists and therefore have aligned beliefs on the hazards of centralized power in the form of governance.  This in large part makes it hard for me to categorically theorize as to his true intentions.  It seems hard to believe he would consciously abandon his own (seemingly genuine) core belief structure regarding central authority only when pertaining to Bitcoin.  Perhaps the more likely situation is just impatience combined with naiveté as to the economic / philosophical cost of his solution.   
**Jihan Wu &amp; Other Miners**  
The miners intentions are text book game theory really.  They seek self interest above all else and thus may have temporarily aligned their operations with Ver in an clandestine attempt to suspend the systems progress.  Miner fees have skyrocketed as a result of the block size debate and however they may appear to perceive this publicly, one can only imagine how profitable this deadlock has been for them.  If it were solely left to their discretion I believe this block size debate would continue ad infinitum.  I would also have the community notice that mining economics are not exceedingly complicated.  It seems oddly coincidental that only 30-40% of miners should follow Unlimited whilst the rest remain silent or signal Segregated Witness if Unlimited was the logical path.  What do those 30-40% of miners understand economically that the rest do not?  Or is it perhaps in the temporary best interest of all miners that a significant for show, albeit insufficient for action, number of miners appear at odds with the flock?
**The Users**  
Bitcoin is very complex subject even for the well educated and as with any topic in life there will always exist energetic and seemingly knowledgeable personalities who will happily simplify the topic for the price of subscription to their point of view.  I think many of the Unlimited followers fall into this category.  Whatever his true intentions may be Roger Ver is clearly an intelligent person, and possesses a knack for supplanting real technical / economic truth seeking with utterance of one of several unprovable catch phrases.  It is very easy to be drawn in by such a gross over-simplification of an otherwise complex field.  
**The Solution**  
The UASF is actually a far more elegant solution then it first appears.  Mainly it takes the power away from the miners who, as I stated above, would not serve their own best interests by resolving this debate quickly.  It also sets a hard timeline for preparation and expectations for all players in the network. This far out from the activation date the community seems in disarray however I expect the degree of obscurity toward segwit support to lessen as activation closes in, slowly at first until eventually all at once.   
The mining community is largely jawboning in my mind and the alliance with Ver is at best a fair-weather friendship to keep the charade alive for as long as possible whilst they pocket the gold.  Alas the farce cannot continue forever and with a hard stop date pushing them into a corner the status quo will prevail.

It might be unreasonable to assume they are all being attacked.  But it's not unreasonable to see the correlation between a drop in BU nodes and a spike up in Core nodes.  Would be an unlikely coincidence if a bunch of random users just decided to start new Core nodes today..  Much more likely that BU nodes are dropping and switching back to Core protocol.
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:25:51
A quote I like from Ayn Rand plays well here;  


I've informed myself thoroughly on the scaling issue the past few weeks and I have come to the conclusion that the actual debate for bitcoin users is not big block vs small blocks or Core vs Unlimited or Miners vs Programmers.  If we remove the self-interested figure heads (Roger Ver, Jihan Wu) we can clearly see that the debate at it's core is actually Commodity vs Currency or simply store of value vs transaction velocity.  
I come to this conclusion by asking the basic question;
**Why do Bitcoin Unlimited supporters support Bitcoin Unlimited?**  
It seems like a silly question but it's important to understand.  After all why WOULD any users support such a drastic and arguably dangerous change to the protocol?  Any reasonable person who has been involved in Bitcoin for more than a few months and understands the ebb and flow of the price surrounding just about ANY industry news should understand that the price would plummet in the aftermath of a hard fork and may not recover for years to come.  So it stands to reason that these users can't be investors.  Why would an investor (see Hodler) support a change that is so clearly against their own best interests?  They wouldn't, it just doesn't make any sense.  However we know that they still seem to greatly care about the outcome of the scaling debate.  The conclusion... They don't care about the price.  The great divide that is the scaling debate essentially comes down to two groups of people.
**Users who desire a store of value to take control of and protect their wealth against external malicious forces. (Decentralized Commodity) (Segwit)**  
and  
**Users who desire low cost, fast transactions for everyday purchases right now (Decentralized Currency) (Unlimited)**    
The issue with the unlimited viewpoint is fairly basic however.  Transaction speed is but one small piece of what the Bitcoin protocol offers it's users.  The vast majority of us who live in first and second world countries have, at our fingertips, the ability to send fast transactions of any value using Paypal, Venmo, EFT, ACH and Credit cards, among others.  We as Bitcoin users value the pseudo-anonymity, we value the transaction capabilities and we value the manner of control which it gives us over our own savings.  We also value the security and the innovation of things to come.  We must not fall into the trap of believing that high transaction velocity creates high value or supplants the other important attributes of the network.  High transaction velocity is a benefit that the system will ultimately deliver in time but must not be achieved at the expense of the myriad of core features that also give Bitcoin it's value.  Bitcoin is unique because it allows us complete immutable control over our own savings, not because it has the capability to become Paypal 2.0.  That, is just an added benefit.

I agree could be a compliance issue.  The rhetoric is popular though because at any given time should the government of any country wish to destroy (or at least significantly set back) bitcoin, all they would have to do is shut down the on and off ramps.. ie the banks/exchanges and it's over.  Apps like Abra and Local Bitcoins are necessary to prevent centralization and risk from classical banks frankly.

I agree, the reputation and validation system will have to be very similar to Uber.  Tellers should have to be vetted and known and assuming meetups occur in public places I think theft can be kept to a minimum.  After all the average teller for this application is probably a poor college kid trying to earn some extra cash, unlikely that tellers are going to be huge targets for robbery (again game theory fits into this as well, yes high target number but yes low target payout).  Ideally a 'robber' or bad actor in the system would prefer a lower target number with maximum target payout.

Correlation between bitcoin and offshore yuan has been near -.8 the past few months.  Last night PBOC smacked the overnight HIBOR TO 80% causing a short stop rally in offshore yuan.

The main reason is that arbitrage between china exchanges is slow due to restrictions on movement of fiat currencies.

There are anecdotes left and right of large AUM / Hedge funds seeking to buy bulk bitcoins.

I used to, I made some money but the truth is most of it was luck.  Technical indicators do not work that well for Bitcoin, it's just too volatile.  Macro moves are unpredictable and can come from any angle totally wiping out your position if your setup the wrong way. (true of any day trade but especially with bitcoin).  My advice would be to hodl hodl hodl.  I've made far more money buying the dips and riding the wave then I did trying to day trade.  Add to that the risk of keeping your funds on an exchange and it just becomes not worth it.

"The moon" is defined by the price that BTC needs to be in order to be financially capable of doing all the things that it is inherently technologically capable of.  Until you can send very large sums of money across the network without inducing large price movement and ultimately store that capital pre and post tx for a period of weeks / months without fear of gaining / losing more than 1% of the total sum then we have not reached "the moon".  If BTC is to become financially capable it won't be a possibility but rather a REQUIREMENT that liquidity match demand.  Tough to say exactly what number that occurs at as demand can be an ever rising quantity but I think it is safe to say it sits somewhere in the 250k - 1m$ / unit area.  A highly priced BTC may seem wacky but do the math and it becomes clear how it's actually a necessity not a possibility or probability.  Especially as inflation continues to chug forward globally.  A 17-18tn$ mkt cap equates to roughly 10% of global M1 supply.  Far from an impossibility imo given the myriad of markets / investments and utility that Bitcoin displaces.

What possible reason could there be to mine empty blocks if not to make ASICBOOST more efficient?  They forego thousands of dollars worth of TX fees each time they mine an empty block.  Oh right I forgot "They do it because the freedom of the Bitcoin code allows them to"...

Not sure if the bank stuff will blow over but theres no question in my mind that Finex is solvent.  I used to speak to their CEO on a daily basis back in the day and all in all hes a good guy and they have a solid team over there.  If they aren't able to secure new banking relationships though they will likely just make a one time check out to each fiat holder on the site and move to a crypto only exchange.

Is this huge news for Bitcoin? Yes and no.  It drums up some bad PR surrounding the Silk Road and dark web nonsense that is but a small portion of the use case for pseudonymous digital currencies.  Something this community has long since gotten over however it should be of note that Dan Brown's first book in the Robert Langdon series, The Da Vinci Code, sold over 200m copies world wide in dozens of languages.  His last in the series, Inferno, sold over 83m.  There are expectations that this latest book, Origin will top that.  That amounts to quite a few people who have no involvement in the tech industry hearing the word Bitcoin for the first time.

I've always liked Peter, hes made some great predictions in the past, I think he is a very intelligent and genuine person.  Have read all his books and agree with 95+% of what he says.  I'm really not sure how hes gotten it so wrong with Bitcoin.  He just doesn't seem to see the true value and use cases.  My best guess is because he really doesn't come from a technical background.  We here are a mix of technologists and economists since Bitcoin requires it of us.  Peter is just an economist.

There was a large supply area between 12 and 1300. u/rrssh is correct, 1200 x 1.33% = ~1600.  It is a range though not a specific number.
@_date: 2018-04-07 04:51:43
No it wasn't.  Try harder bitfinex shorts �� you guys are about to get rekt 
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:30:13
There isn't any clear data to show at which price traders open their positions, there are however clear trading signals that show areas of supply and demand.  The 1200-1300 area was a large supply area that price pressed through over time.  This indicates that many of the short positions that were opened were opened around this supply range.  It is an estimation not an exact science, some of those positions will be lower some higher but as an average that is the general range.
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:34:17
Hey so my post depicted a range between 1600-1700 where a lot of shorts would be FL as I explained in the comments a few times.  We barely broke 1600$ before sellers brought us back down. If there is another attempt (likely) and we move into the 1650$ range I would expect fireworks..
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:21:26
the only issue would be if your coins are on bitfinex, potentially they could halt trading depending on how fast/far price rose.  That may include temporarily halting withdrawals as well.  Other than that if you are just holding bitcoins long the only thing you will be is a high degree of volatility and big price movements.
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:07:18
Well the free market is the free market and the price shows only the number at which buyers and sellers meet.  However your assumption that the foundation of the higher price will be very thin is definitely correct.
@_date: 2017-05-01 16:19:07
we are at 1520$
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:27:48
you can always add margin to a margin call however many investors who short large amounts in that nature do not allow their stops to be variable.  If their position is stopped out its because their call was incorrect and they allow it to happen.  Adding margin or varying stops is bad trading generally.
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:58:03

@_date: 2017-05-20 17:43:11
Time to sell!!!
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:32:26
Yeah some shorts definitely got liquidated up into that rise but keep in mind the 1600$ mark is a range not an exact price.  It's not a big red 'nuke it' button.  I expect the movement to try to take out the 1600 level again in force before a correction though.  If we get to the middle of the zone ~1650 without fireworks I will be surprised, however there are other forces at play.  Bitfinex can sell their own coins to keep price in check, sellers can come in to take advantage of the arb premium etc.  This is just one possibility, but in my mind a fairly likely one. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:43:34
A better statement would be "As long as governments continue to try to control your money Bitcoin will climb"
@_date: 2017-05-01 16:43:09
Agreed it isn't, just pointing out to anyone who might be short that things are going to get pretty wild if BFX pumps to the 1600 area.  The ask book can't currently handle 17K BTC shorts liquidating so I have no idea what the price would even become.  They might halt trading.
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:59:30
Forced liquidation is forced and sellers are limited on BFX right now due to the withdrawal issues.  Bitfinex themselves may begin to sell their own coins to manage price if it gets out of hand
@_date: 2017-05-01 02:26:04
The price is rising into issues with BFX withdrawls, if they end up fixing their usd withdrawls or finding a viable work around that will allow arbitrage to come back in watch the price fall like a stone.
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:57:23
We need short sellers for proper price discovery.  If everyone was long the price would rise at a ridiculous pace and BTC would be quite unusable

That is my point exactly, if it turns out we never had the power to fire the miners then the bitcoin project has failed and is nothing more than Paypal.  The miners will do what they are forced to do by all govt forces.
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:14:23
Thats essentially correct.  When someone is short it means they are betting that the market will trend downward rather than upward.  When trading on margin (ie with borrowed capital) if the price moves against the investor he loses money at some multiple of his full investment.  For bitfinex exchange the maximum margin is 3.3x so if you had a single bitcoin that you wanted to short on margin you would actually be allowed to short 3.3 bitcoins.  In that case the investor would borrow the other 2.3 bitcoin from someone willing to lend it to him at an established rate of interest.  The issue is that because the investor is leveraged 3.3x his actual holdings (1 bitcoin) the price only needs to move against him 33% before he loses his entire bitcoin.  At this point the short position is immediately closed by the exchange (forced liquidation) and the remaining 2.3 bitcoin is purchased back automatically by the exchange to return it to the lender (+ the interest rate accrued).  Theyre are currently 17K bitcoins worth of short positions on the exchange that are all active from a similar location 1200-1300 area.  Should the price rise 33% (~1600$) many of those positions will be liquidated causing the price to rise further as the exchange automatically buys bitcoin to return to the lenders.  This can create what is called a waterfall or cascading liquidation where the liquidation of one persons position rises the prices substantially enough to liquidate another persons position and so on.  In this scenario the price can rise VERY quickly as the more positions get liquidated the more additional positions are forced to liquidate.

Luke has always said that BIP148 proposes no risk "as long as enough support exists before aug 1".  I think he recognizes that a chain split could occur at ~30-40% BIP148 support. 40%+ and there is no danger as the BIP148 chain has no wipe out risk whereas the non BIP148 chain does.  10-15% support can be picked up in a day and would wipe out the entire non 148 chain every time it happened.  Game theory suggests everyone would switch quickly to the 148 chain in that case to avoid transacting on the non wipe out protected chain and there would be no issue.

To be fair I should have said "could" wipe out ask book, not "will".  Not trying to promote FUD here just saying a lot of people are still very short on BFX and price is rising quickly in FL zones on those shorts.  BFX has apparently stated that they will sell their own coins "if the price is attractive enough".  IE they will attempt to save the exchange from halted trading by selling their own coins into the liquidation.
@_date: 2017-07-07 03:04:25

@_date: 2017-05-02 03:09:45
They would (and do) have a bit of a "liquidity" problem.  Part of the reason the price has dragged higher off of such low volume is that bitfinex lacks a large number of sellers due to their withdrawal issues.  If forced liquidation were to happen in a big way on the exchange it would likely cause a lot of issues for them as the ask (selling side) book is very thing right now.  The price could rise infinitely on the exchange with no sellers present

Decentralization and immutability is a large part of what makes Bitcoin valuable.  Anyone who disagrees does not understand Bitcoin or basic economics.  If I could print gold would it be valuable?  The answer is obviously no.  Centralizing Bitcoin hinders these two main qualities thus lowering value.  If users care only about transactions clearing I would introduce them to Paypal or Venmo, transactions are very fast and always clear.  Of course your transactions are made in a worthless fiat currency that can be printed into oblivion but thats just semantics right?  I find it's generally the simple minded folks who desire block size increases.  They can add 1+1 and see that it equals faster transaction time.  What they don't have the capacity to see are the dangers that such a change creates.  The risk / reward is not tenable.
I should also point out that is was the 'evil' corporations who spent millions of dollars spamming the mempool with dust transactions the past 12 months to make it look like blocks were full in support of their obviously manipulative argument.  Or was that just one of those odd coincidences that simple minded people tend to put so much faith in?  I would recommend you read up on game theory to improve your understanding of human nature

It's true he made some security mistakes for sure.  The biggest being using some sort of weird 3rd party mail account that was insecure.  But in truth it can happen to anyone, which is why second layers of security are so important.  Whats even MORE important is understanding how the second layer of security (2FA in this case) is functioning.  Good hackers are masters at multi-tasking and creating angles of attack so we have to be equally skilled at understanding what those vectors might be.  As crypto goes up in price even those of us who own a single bitcoin will become valuable targets.

technically using a real authenticator wouldn't have stopped this.  Authy by default gives anyone access to private keys on a new mobile device by simply entering in the phone number associated with the authy account.  If you have control of the phone number then breaking authy is 1,2,3.  There is an option within authy to turn off the add device feature.  It should be set to off by default in my mind this is a huge security flaw
