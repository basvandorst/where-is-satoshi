Remember, it crashes upwards. We wanted 15k by the end of the year. For it to be stable at 15k, that always means rising above it then crashing back down. 
No need to panic that it crashed down to yesterday's ATH! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:49:45
I got into BTC for the same reason. Won a bet on Bovada and sent the profits to BTC. At the time it was about 2.5+ BTC. By the time I cashed it out to USD my winnings had gone from 800 to 1200. I was so excited. To think if I had just left it in there, that 800 would be 42k today.

19.1 on Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:59:57
If you're new and your investment is small, it's probably easier to just keep them in Coinbase. They do the forking for you, and you'll be able to resume transactions about 4 hours after the fork. 
It's the same risk as holding there at any other point, really. The second transactions are unfrozen after the fork, transfer to a private wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:25:45
Something happened. A bunch of us stocked up on BTC near 5500 and had 2k gains in a few days! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:33:24
I hope so.  That would be amazing for increasing my holdings.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:15:20
I agree with you. I'm selfishly hoping that there's a dip to the 6-6.5K range that causes some people to panic and push us back into the 5k realm so I can stock up on some more coin before the real boom to the moon begins. But I think by the time we get to the fork, we'll be scraping 9K, and even a significant dip is going to keep us in the 6K range.  
I'll still stock up, and set some triggers to buy larger amounts if it does fall into the 5's at any time during the fluctuation, but at this point I don't think it's going to happen.  
What's your strategy for the fork out of curiosity? Are you dumping the 2x right away into BTC? Thinking it may also be worth it to buy some eth. and litecoin right before the fork as everyone jumps into BTC for the "free money" and then selling for a small profit once everyone diversifies again and the price returns to where it was a couple weeks ago.  But by and large I don't like messing with anything other than Core BTC.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:07:23
I think so, you'll just need a new wallet specifically designated for B2X, I believe.  I'm honestly not planning on transferring my B2X out of Coinbase unless it completely surprises me by taking off, so I haven't looked into storage too much.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:05:47
Decide what you want to invest. Invest half today, and half after the fork. Minimizes your risk and maximizes opportunity. 
If this is the lowest BTC will ever be again, you got in at this price.  If there's a massive dip after the fork, you still have 50% of your investment waiting to capitalize on the momentary bargain.  
Safest bet in my opinion.  Evens it out, even though one of the two buys will feel like a worse deal. Just don't get nervous if you buy now and there's a lull and sell during a crash.  You'll actualize your loss and truly lose the money.  Hold through the drops. Really, if you believe in the tech, you want to buy during the drops.  It's best to hold or buy through the all time highs, too, but if you are ever going to cash a little out, never do it during a crash.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:26:41
No, at this point there is no free bitcoin. It's too widely recognized as having value.  It is literally the equivalent now of saying, "I'd like to have a bank account, but don't have the money to put it in. Are there any bank accounts I can get with money already in it?"
My recommendation would be to buy in small, even at a $100 or something.  Take a couple months and don't eat out at restaurants or see that movie in theaters or impulse buy that thing on Amazon, and roll your non-essentials/bill budget into BTC.  
You can set up an auto payment for every paycheck to transfer $25 in, or something.  I'm sure you can find that somewhere in your budget.  If you really believe in the tech and see the potential, you'll kick yourself when it's at 25K a coin next year and you could have invested $250 bucks before it was 10K, you know? 
Up to you.  A lot of us who think we see what's actually happening and about to happen with the *phenomenon* of cryptocurrency would rather keep our money with BTC than USD.  
Not *that* much different than keeping your money as gold instead of paper, with the added benefit of converting to USD (or whatever your country's currency is) from your computer or cell phone at leisure if you need/want to.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:27:27
I don't think on Coinbase you can go from one to the other. But you can always sell the B2X 4 hours after the fork and place an order for the same dollar amount in Bitcoin at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:05:13
Absolutely! Best of luck out there. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:40:15
The thing is that there are so many HODLers now that if it dropped dramatically, we'd all swoop and increase the demand again. 
Government regulation is probably the only worst case scenario I'm worried about long term. And I hope that's not an issue under a republican administration, they're usually a bit more restrained in expanding government regulation to new territories.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:35:45
We're still the early adopters, despite the exponential growth experienced by the fringe who bought in during BTC's infancy. There's still incredible potential buying in now. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:06:05
You won't regret that buy when we're at 10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:26:00
For sure. Happy cake day!
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:00:34
Exactly right in the short term.
I also have a long term perspective about holding. I'm betting on the tech. I believe we're still *by far* the "early adopters," and over time cryptocurrency will be revolutionary and the price will skyrocket exponentially.  
I see it like we're in the 90's, and some weeks we're buying Google stock at $10 a share, some weeks we're buying it at $30 a share.  Sure, the lower end is a way better deal, but I'm not trying to triple my money by buying at $10 and selling at $30.  I'm thinking about ten years down the line when it's trading at $1K a share and I've racked up 1000 shares at an average of $20 each.  
Not worrying about the little differences in value between $10-$30 still set me up for a windfall, and a $20,000 investment has become $1,000,000.  
It's a slightly larger scale now with BTC, but buying indiscriminately between, say 5K and 8K valuation of BTC in the short term without allows me to work my way up to let's say 5BTC at an average 6.5K per BTC.  I believe within a decade, we'll see over a million dollar valuation of BTC. That means my $32,500 investment would yield $5,000,000.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:29:34
You profit by proportional %.  If you invest $100, and BTC rises by 50%, then you'll profit $50.  But if you had invested $5,000 dollars, you would have profited by $2,500. 
We don't know what's going to happen with the fork.  There is a new Cryptocurrency branching off from BTC that's attempting to become the "real BTC."  Most of us here think it will die in its infancy.  I think BTC will rise until shortly before the fork, then there will be a rush of people who sell to avoid uncertainty that will drive the price down again.  Then after the fork, all the people who hold and stayed through will transfer a good portion of their new currency back into BTC, and the demand will go back up so it will start rising again. At the same time, all the people who sold to avoid uncertainty will start buying back in at a "lower rate" to maximize their holdings once they see the climb starting again.  
At this point I believe we'll surpass where we were before the fork, and begin moving up again.  
So if you're looking to start buying in, I'd recommend you decide how much you want to invest. Invest half today, and invest half after the fork causes a little drop.  It may *not* cause a drop that lasts long enough to capitalize on it, though.  
At this point, with a single mac, you probably won't earn enough mining BTC to even justify the cost of the electricity it takes to run the computer.  I'd recommend just buying in, setting up an auto-buy system to buy a little bit every paycheck, and hold on to it through the highs and lows.  I have hope we'll see 100K in the relatively near future, and even 1M per coin by the end of the decade *if not higher*.  It'll rise and fall all the way up there, but if you think long term, you're still getting in very early.  
You'll probably buy on a website like coinbase.  Don't keep your bitcoin on there after you buy it.  Set up a private wallet on your computer, at the very least, and transfer it to there.  Only then do you actually own the BTC you paid for.  It's both insecure from things like hacking in the marketplace, and subject to whatever the marketplace feels like doing.  
I think Electrum is a good private wallet that's a compromise between easy to use and security.  It's not the most secure, but if you're new to this and not investing massive sums of money, it will be fine for you.  
You'll have more security by transferring your wallet to some kind of device that is not connected to the internet.  Even "safer" is a paper wallet. I don't think you need to worry about that right away. Get a handle on the basics first, and if your wealth starts growing to a point where you feel the need to up your security, look further into it.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:52:39
I'd say no. My guess is that BTC will hit at least 8k by the fork, so the dip may not even go past 7-7.5. Also a strong possibility of no dip whatsoever or even a boom if a bunch of the whales immediately sell hefty portions of their B2X and roll into BTC. 
It's less of a gamble to hold. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:34:09
My guess is that there will be 2 or 3 different days with rapid growth between now and the fork, and in between will mostly be a hovering game.  
I suspect a big boom right up until the fork, until just before when all the cautious people, excitable people, shorters, and day traders sell, which will cause a small crash.  Then I imagine after the fork, a great deal of the people who held will convert a hefty proportion of the B2X to BTC, and when the demand starts rising again, all the nervous people and day traders will figure out the down-ward spiral has stopped and buy back in at a lower rate, further increasing the demand.  Within a couple weeks of the fork, I think we'll be at another ATH, and then we'll be back to the "normal" single-heart-attack-a-day-roller-coaster.

What do you predict for the short term during and following the fork? I agree with your other comment that it will hit 10k by the new year, but without any hiccup at the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:17:03
On one and a half percent of a bitcoin, you "overbought" by, what, $35? You're not even going to notice that when BTC gets to 10K, let alone 25K. 
Getting in during this general time, give or take a few hundred dollars depending on the specific hour and day, is the best you can ask for, really.  You'll be glad you started buying at 7200 rather than 12500, you know? 
There may be a drop after the fork.  Set a little aside just in case to maximize holdings!
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:26:18
You don't technically own the BTC stored in coin base. They could freeze the account for security or stabilization reasons indefinitely and keep you from selling if that's your intention. There was initially some worry that coinbase could do wonky things at the fork that resulted in a complete loss off bitcoin. 
They've clarified to what you've said in your OP, and they're only intending to freeze transactions for 4 hours after the fork. If you're holding anyway, it appears to me the risk is minimized to the general risks of holding your coin on an exchange. You don't own it, and it's more susceptible to hacks and the like. 
In your situation, I think it's minimal enough that the convenience of Coinbase forking your coin for you makes it more worth your while to keep it there during the fork. Figure out what you want to do with the B2X and after the fork and whatever transaction you decide to make with the new crypto, transfer to a private wallet (or wallets if you keep the B2X). 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:56:26
Never, ever invest more than you can afford to recover from losing. 
Don't expect immediate profit. There will likely be a crash before you start seeing profit. 
Yes, you can make money through Bitcoin with only 1K invested, but the real money is made long term. It's hard to predict how quickly you can repay that loan in the short term. It rises and falls, and quick profits may as well be luck. If you're only in it for a few months, then you are gambling, not investing. 
Let's assume you won't be able to put your money in until after the fork. We have no idea what it's going to look like in the weeks following the fork. 
If it were me taking the loan of 1k, this is what I would do:
Let's assume you're buying in at 8K. Hopefully you can get in somewhere in the 6k range or lower after the fork, but let's just assume 8K. 
I'd put the 1k into Bitcoin, then get on a tight budget for a couple months. No eating out at restaurants, no seeing movies in the theater, no impulse Amazon purchases. Instead, take that budget and buy more BTC each week no matter what the price is. Increasing the amount of a Bitcoin you own increases how quickly you see profit when the value of a Bitcoin rises. 
Since you're taking a loan for 1k, I'll assume that by scrimping and saving you can afford to put in about $30 a week or more. Better than nothing, it's an extra 120 a month, which is 12% of your total loan that is hopefully accumulating value for you every month. This will help you repay the loan faster. 
You'll see throughout a couple months that there are rises and falls. It will be very tempting to sell at new highs. Let's say it hits 12k a coin in January. That means that off the $1360 (your loan, plus $30 a week for three months) you invested, you now have an account worth approximately 2K. 
My personal course of action would be to hold on, despite your ability to repay this loan. When you sell 1k, that loan has stopped accruing value. The more you have in BTC, the more dramatic the gains when the value rises. Your initial investment of 1k was .125 of a full Bitcoin. But cashing out now means the 1K you've made is only .083 of a full Bitcoin, since the value has increased to 12k. You're actually losing value since the initial loan. 
I would try to hold to a point where you are better off in taking the 1k out than you were when you put it in, in terms of holding % of a Bitcoin. 
Let's forget exponential growth and suppose another 3 months has brought the value of a BTC to 16k in March. 
Your 2k is now almost 3k, adding in the extra 360 you've put in since March. When you take out 1k to repay the loan, you now have 2k in BTC at a 16K valuation, which puts you back at owning .125 of a Bitcoin, the same position you were in when you first got your loan in terms of value, except now your loan is paid off and it's all profit, plus you're sitting on double the initial loan in USD. 
Now you're investing in Bitcoin totally on your own capital. A lot of us here are long term holders and buyers and I recommend you do the same. If you sold now you'd have 2k USD to show for it (1280 profit after subtracting your own investments each week). But by conservative estimates, if Bitcoin hits 32k by November 2018, you would have 4K from your 2k, plus 8 months of $30 a week ($960, building on itself), which would put you in the neighborhood of $5500 USD, or .152 of a Bitcoin, the most you've had in both Bitcoin holdings and USD so far. 
Now think about continuing to invest while holding on to what you've already had long term. When BTC reaches 100k, you could be sitting on 20k or .2 of a Bitcoin. If it gets mass adoption and hits a million dollars by 2023 like some have speculated, with only an initial investment of 1k (which you've paid back) and $30 a week, in five years you're sitting on a quarter of a million dollars and a quarter of a Bitcoin. It could theoretically hit 25 million a coin in the next decade, and now you're a millionaire. 
Now imagine if as you start to earn more money through the next few years, you budget more and more towards Bitcoin. Your birthday checks, your bonuses at work, upping the weekly buy as you get pay raises. 
If you believe in the tech and study what's going on with the phenomenon of Bitcoin, you start to see how high the potential is for valuation and the hold and buy method makes more and more sense. 
You can make quick and small profits, or delay having your money stored in a bank account rather than stored in a Bitcoin account, and have a real nest egg in 5-10 years time. 
Just some thoughts. That's just what I would do starting in your shoes, based on what I believe the market projections indicate for the future of cryptocurrency. 
Also, don't store your money in the marketplace where you buy Bitcoin, like Coinbase. After the coin comes in, download a private wallet of some kind and store them there, then transfer your own investments to that wallet every month. After you have a sizable chunk of money, spread it out over multiple wallets. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:02:08
 Bought like crazy in the 5k realm over the drop. Think we'll get back down there, or do you think it's upward bound for a bit now? Trying to decide if should wait to invest the other half now or if it may fluctuate a bit more.
Recovered way faster than I expected. Didn't have time to buy as much as I wanted. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:40:58
I ultimately think that cashing out any significant amount is a bad investment long term.  I think with all the dips and ATHs, it's steadily climbing into unknown potential.  I wouldn't want to excitedly cash out my 5K bitcoin at 12K, rejoicing at my 240% profit, only to watch BTC get to 25k eight months later, you know? 
I think a safe strategy is that once you have made 400% of your investment, cash out your initial investment as close to an ATH as you can. Count your new balance as your initial investment, and once you have 400% of that, cash out that same amount in the same fashion.  
And only if you need to. Otherwise, I think long term, everyone who holds tight is going to happy they kept every penny they ended up keeping in BTC.

I was up at 3-4am Pacific Time and it briefly hit 7150-7200. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:38:49
You don't know that there will be a low. There's a possibility of a BTC boom after the fork, in which case you're selling near or at an ATH and then will have to buy back in even higher. 
I anticipated a dip, but the whales I talk to disagree with me and seem to think many huge holders will immediately sell the B2X and roll it into BTC, causing another boom. It'll ebb and flow, but it will likely be somewhere between 8-9k at the fork, and could potentially jump up higher afterward, then even when it recedes it may not get below 7.5 again. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:01:31
Every time it drops I buy more. Trying to increase my holdings as much as possible until the next boom to a new plateau. 
We'll eventually get to 10k, and people will worry when it fluctuates down to 8.5, ignoring that Bitcoin crashes upwards. 
Didn't worry last time. Not worrying now. Won't worry the next time. Buying on the dips and holding as we go to the moon. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:41:47
I'm talking about a less than one week dip. To as short as sleeping through it accidentally. Just the adjustment around all the people who sell at the peak before the fork, sell to avoid the uncertainty of the fork, and the people selling to capitalize on the dip will cause a momentary negative fluctuation. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:59:13
1-1.5k is my guess. I suspect a slight growth before an inevitable death. My plan is to sell half immediately, and either hit a few highs and sell the rest or just let in run into the ground. 
I dont see it having the exponential growth or adoption of BTC enough to bet against BTC so I plan on using any uncertainty in the market to maximize my BTC holdings. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:42:30
I strongly recommend holding. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:11:48
Agreed. Just highlighting the rationale. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:35:21
There's no "should" here, because we don't know how the market is going to respond. I'll tell you what I would personally do, but I'm a biased and speculative perspective, so don't necessarily accept this as the intelligent path. 
If I had 10K to play with in BTC right now, my strategy would be to buy in about 4K when I received the money. In part to safeguard against the possibility that there will be no significant drop, and I'll have wished I bought before, but in part to capitalize on the split and get some B2X. 
I'd set aside about 2K to try and time during the fluctuation for potential drops (maybe even set up an automatic trigger to buy 2K at a certain price point, in case I miss it in real time). Then I'd invest the final 4K after the fork.  
If I had the energy would potentially subtract $500 from each of those three purchase points, and use the extra 1.5K to try and time the alt-coin fluctuation.  Right now, alt-coins are tanking because everyone is transferring their holdings in those coins to BTC to maximize what they receive from the fork.  
After the fork, they'll likely spread their investments back out again, driving those prices back to at least what they were about last month.  It seems to be an almost failsafe super-short-term holding to make a little extra to invest in BTC. But I tend to not like messing with the alt-coins or playing the market any differently than consistent buying and holding. So I probably won't do that on this fork, but I would if I had an extra 10k to play with.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:57:00
A play on the word hold. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:06:34
I find it more likely that people are pumping money from other cryptos into BTC to maximize their holdings in B2X for the purpose of banking on BTC and funneling the new fork back into their BTC holdings. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:46:02
I don't think it's a sure enough bet to do this myself.  What I am planning on doing is setting up serveral auto-buys for if BTC dips.  If it gets to 5.5K, buy a hefty amount. If it gets to 5K, even more. Get really radical in the low 4's, etc.  Just in case. 
I don't feel strongly enough about this to bet against BTC with my current holdings.  I also want to hold and continue to buy in order to do my small part to encourage the market towards BTC.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:56:42
It's processing power, really.  You'd need a great deal of computers running 24/7 to make anything noticeable from mining these days.  It takes much longer to mine 1/1000 of BTC now than it used to take to mine an entire BTC or more, and it'll keep getting more difficult as they get closer to mining all 21 million of them.  
If you've got a single, multi-use computer you're planning on starting to mine with, it probably isn't worth your time.  If you put a hundred dollars in a BTC wallet today, you'll probably make more from increased valuation than mining over the same amount of time.  
I don't mine, myself, so maybe somebody who does can chime in here.  But that's the understanding I have.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:08:00
50% of what I have liquid for savings. I prefer it in BTC to the comparatively minuscule interest it earns in savings. 
I can afford to do this as half of a DINK couple. My other 50% is enough for bills and essentials, excursions, and emergency funds. 
I haven't switched over a great deal of my long term investments, but I may end up doing about 20% of what I hold long term in BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:22:57
I buy every single paycheck regardless of rate to increase my holdings.  
But let's say you make 20K. Where else is your 1,000 going to make you 20X your investment? Hold that same amount for two years in a savings account or IRA, earn somewhere between 2-8% interest.  If you believe in BTC and see where the market is going, you're looking at 2,000% interest.  
Still the best offer in town for your 1K. Although I recommend continuing to buy in intervals over time.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:40:54
Coinbase will let you do 10K a month from your bank account in $2,500 installments per week. 
You can get on a few different marketplaces and have multiple wallets if you're trying to get it all more quickly than that. Nothing wrong with that.  Then transfer from each account to the same private wallet or spread it out over multiple private wallets if you'd like to. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:02:07
Don't pump and dump. It's not a sure enough thing to bank on. My recommendation is to decide what you're willing to invest, do half today and half after the fork. Both will end up being a steal if you're holding long term, and you'll minimize the risk of missing out if this is about the lowest it will be again, and still have some set aside to capitalize on a crash if one does happen after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:04:41
My personal advice:
Don't try to time the market. BTC doesn't lend itself that easily to doing so, and ultimately the small amounts you can make by buying in at a certain time of day versus another isn't going to prove consistent enough to stress over.  Generally a bad idea to short BTC, as well.  
Buy into BTC because you believe in the tech and are planning on holding it. Hold long term and buy a little more each pay period, because  the real value of BTC will be after mass adoption. Not these little windfalls everyone is making now.  
You are still early to the party. It's a good time. However, my opinion is that because of the uncertainty of the upcoming fork, that you should invest only half of what you were planning now, and invest the other half after the fork occurs.  You'll likely lose out on one side of the other, so spreading it out will ease it.  
If you believe in the tech, then short term valuation doesn't really matter.  A significant dip isn't a reason to panic, it's a great opportunity to take advantage of the under-valuation and buy a little or a lot more than you usually do.  
I use Coinbase, because it's easy, but I'm figuring out GDAX right now to avoid fees.  I move to Electrum to hold long term in order to keep my BTC off of the exchange. It's more secure than letting Coinbase own your Bitcoin, but others will recommend storing them offline or even in a paper wallet.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:17:34
Yep other cryptos, specifically ethereum and litecoin.  There's just a predictable dip in demand that will return to normal after the fork.  
If I had extra money to play with, I would bank a little on short term there.

Personally, with such a modest amount it will probably be easier and low risk to just keep it in coinbase through the fork.

There will be two competing versions of the coin. Very unlikely that they can co-exist.  We don't know how it will effect BTC (that's default "normal BTC," the new one is abbreviated B2X) but I have my speculation:
I think B2X misunderstands a lot of what people like about Bitcoin, it doesn't have the adoption that Bitcoin already has in place, it doesn't have the whales that BTC has in the market who are personally invested in the success of the coin, it doesn't have the name recognition/branding and track record that Bitcoin is only now able to use to get new people outside of the tech world interested in investing.  The fact that B2X is set up as a competing coin means, in my opinion, a pretty quick death.  
There are a lot of Bitcoin "loyalists" who are planning on holding through the fork and continuing to invest in BTC.  There seems to be no public support for the new coin, but a lot of anger and contempt towards it.  
When the chain splits, everyone will have their proportional holding of bitcoins in the B2X.  A lot of us holders are planning on immediately selling that B2X and taking continuing to bet on BTC.  Since that's our perspective going into the fork, that means this B2X fork is just giving us free capital to roll back into BTC.  
What you can see happening with the rise we've had this week is that the rise is occurring at the same time the other cryptos are plummeting.  People are transferring a lot of their coins from things like LiteCoin or Ethereum into Bitcoin so that they have more B2X available in the transfer.  
This causes an increase in the demand of BTC, so the valuation raises. This causes a lot of people to realize BTC is getting more valuable, like yourself, so they invest from scratch. Usually knowing only about BTC and not planning on also investing in other cryptocurrencies.  This again drives up the demand, and the value.  
I think that this rise will continue to happen as we approach the actual fork. Then, just before the fork, there will be a little dip because all the people who are nervous about the fork crashing bitcoin and all the people who are blown away by a new all time high will sell, causing a dip in the value. People who see the panic selling coming will also sell while near the high with the intention of buying back their coins at a lower rate after it crashes, which further will cause it to crash.
After the fork happens, some percentage of people will withdraw part of their holdings to re-invest in other cryptos (as they had before, now that they have their "free" coins from the fork), so it will dip a little more. 
This will probably make some people nervous and more will panic sell, which will probably cause the biggest crash in a while. I'm thinking at this point it will be back in the 5K region or so.  
Then, while it's low, all the people like myself who are excited to grab cheaper coins will start buying more. Then all the people who sold just buy back at the crash will buy back in.  Then everyone who holds BTC longterm will likely sell half to all of their B2X and roll it into BTC. And all of this will cause a huge spike to the valuation.  Just think about people like the Winklevoss twins, who hold so much Bitcoin that they're going to have $140,000,000 in B2X.  If they roll even half of that into BTC, that alone is going to show up on the market valuation for both coins. 
At this point, you'll be seeing BTC start to rise steadily, and at the same time B2X falling, and it will start to seem like B2X is failing and BTC is still top dog,  so people on the fence who were holding onto their B2X just in case will want to get back in on the steady rise of BTC, which will further make B2X fall and BTC climb. And at some point, it will just be clear that BTC has "won" and the final skeptics and nervous nellies will jump back. 
I think there will be enough of a boom that it will cause a new all time high, and people who have never had bitcoin will pay attention, like they do from time to time, and another chunk of the population will decide they want in, which will only cause the valuation to rise a little bit more.  
I hope by the end of the year, it'll even out at about 12-15K a coin if we're lucky, and then we'll get back to our regularly scheduled holding and buying as we enjoy the roller coaster of and ups and downs until the next benchmark.

Absolutely. And in very high doses!
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:45:10
Fork could be great for Bitcoin. It's going to give all the HODLers more capital to put back into BTC. The Winklevosses alone have about 100,000 BTC, meaning they'll have 120million in B2X after the fork if the future projections are on target. If they pump 1/2 of that back into BTC, they'd sway the market a bit all by themselves. 
Extrapolate that to all the BTC believers out there, and it could potentially be a huge boom. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:13
Back at almost 10.3K.  I kept trying to buy throughout the few minutes it was in the 8K region and it kept crashing at the confirmation.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:09:27
Futures have it speculated in the 1.2K range.  I'll probably sell half immediately to put back into BTC, and do my small part to correct the market towards BTC. But I may hold the rest of the b2x just in case it goes in an unexpected direction for a little while. I'm not betting on the future of b2x, though.  I think it misunderstands what the market finds valuable in BTC.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:15:13
I think that by the time we hit the price point I'd be willing to sell, Bitcoin will not need to be converted to USD to have the value assigned to it.  Think of adoption in a new currency that's gaining value, rather than investment of an old currency in something like a stock meant to be converted back to the old currency when the stock rises.  
Depending on my financial situation, need, and the actual practical usage of BTC at the time, I might start paying myself out of the my BTC account when it breaks 100K.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:31:23
My guess is 10K by Valentine's Day, 25K by the following New Years.

@_date: 2017-11-03 00:29:38
I suggest targets for cashing out increments. If you believe we're far from the top, it's wise to continue holding more than selling but safe to sell enough to recoup portions of the investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:10:13
In my most liberal estimates I'm projecting 25mil in a decade. Conservatively 10k by Valentine's Day, 25k by the following New Years. 
If something happens, like Amazon accepting BTC or Warren Buffet buying in, growth can be way more dramatic than ever before. 
Remember, there will only ever be 21 million BTCs. The more people who adopt, the more valuable each one necessarily becomes. I'm betting on the tech being revolutionary in time. As soon as the chain reaction of widespread adoption begins, these conservative conversations of 10-20k are going to look like people speculating if it would ever get to 1k or even $100 a few years ago.

Can't you just buy on GDAX with fewer fees? 
You're locked in at the price at the time your payment is processed, not at the time it transfers or you receive your coin.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:37:05
I know that's what I'm doing. In part because I believe in BTC more, in part because I think that's what everyone will do and I want to capitalize asap, and in part because I want to contribute my small bit in swaying the market to BTC after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:01:05
What's a hassle about it? It's two buttons in Coinbase. Buy/Sell tab, enter the amount of coin you're selling, hit sell. It's transferred to the account or card you hooked up to coin base.

I was hoping for this so I could buy more but the whales I know disagree.

@_date: 2017-11-02 17:26:31
It will probably have a short term effect because of all the whales trying to be strategic. Good chance to buy in a little extra at a slight dip, hopefully. But then I think it will correct and continue to grow. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:39:30
I suspect you're right.  The only reason I would is if I still can't pay my living expenses using BTC. I'd keep the lion's share of my worth in BTC, and pay myself the necessary amount in fiat to get along throughout the month.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:48:33
Coinbase is the best place to get started. Really user friendly. 
Do not keep your bitcoin the same place you buy it. That's a marketplace, not a private wallet. You own it once you transfer it to a private wallet. They're easy to get the hang of, but you'll need to research a bit. 
Take look over at @_date: 2017-11-02 15:48:13
We will soon get to a phase where if you don't already own a bitcoin in full, you will not be able to catch one without already having wealth.

@_date: 2017-11-03 00:13:49
If you wanted, you could slowly pay yourself out the initial 1700.  But imagine how you'd feel at 25K after selling at 7k? 
Or 100k? 
Some good advice I've seen for the more skeptical hodlers is 1/4 rule.  
I'll assume you bought a coin.  You bought at 1700, so once it clears four times your investment (6800), you take out that initial investment.  Let's say you sell 1700, now you're at 5300. Consider this your new "initial investment."  When you reach 31,200, take out your 5300.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  
If you're more skeptical about the upper potential of BTC valuation, make it a 1/3 rule instead.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:56:12

Convenience of them splitting it for you and immediate selling of the new coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:27:11
Hold it.  Even if there's a dip after the fork, it will correct itself.  
If BTC completely crashes because of the fork, it'll be because B2X becomes the "new BTC." Holding BTC during the fork will cause you to also be holding B2X, so on the off chance that takes off, by holding you're still on the coattails of the new coin.  
The only reason I can see to sell before the fork is if you're going to *definitely* need your money liquid within a couple of weeks afterwards.  Or you're enough of a risk taker to gamble on a dip after the fork, then you might sell it at the current 7K and buy back the same amount in USD at the lower rate to increase holdings. But that is riskier in my opinion than just holding through the uncertainty. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:33:12
That's smart imo. After the fork, start thinking longer term/bigger investments. 
I believe you will be able to claim B2X from what you hold in your private wallet, but it'll be a bit more complicated of a process. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:47:47
My strategy is to not look at the price except for fun, and buy a little with every single paycheck and hold it. I think that's the only way to maximize what bitcoin is going to do without having remorse in a few months/years about selling too low or not buying more when it was "only" 7.5k. 
It'll probably pass 10k by Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:48:47
Speculation that the fork will cause a dip to the 5-5.5k region. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:46:18
I really don't think you should cash out right now. I suspect big upward momentum soon. Consider at least holding like 50%. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:01:52
A private wallet on your home computer isn't really complicated at all. It'll probably take you about a half an hour.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:22:08
Think of everything that's happening now as negotiating the value of Bitcoin.  The world doesn't quite know what this thing is yet, and as it's adopted, the market recognizes the value.  
By the time we're using it as a widely adopted currency, there will be stabilization.  Thinking of it as an alternative currency and not an investment is a state of mind at the moment, and a good one to have. But at the moment we're riding the wave of the world slowly catching on to BTC.  The exponential growth and dramatic fluctuation has an end point.  
We just don't know when that end point is. And in the meantime, the road there is making a lot of people a lot of money. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:34:56
We aren't banking on short term. The hold strategy is noting trends of global adoption as power players gravitate towards it, and people follow suit. That means its truly in its infancy, and if widely adopted in a few years time, each bitcoin will be worth a small fortune. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins period. As the tech catches on with more and more people, their scarcity makes them more and more valuable. 
Holding is betting on the tech. Not the short term trends. There will very well be lower valuations than 7k. But there are pipe dreams among holders of coins being worth over a million within a decade, so we don't even think of selling for a 1k profit or else we'll feel like all the people who sold at $100. 
If your interest in short term, you should probably sell a couple days before the fork. I suspect it'll get up to about 8k. Then after you may even be able to buy back at around 5-6k and watch it rise again. 
It's a gamble trying to play it short term. But a lot of us feel it's a safe bet to back BTC long term, and just ride the highs and lows in the mean time. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:39:19
I'm not certain that we're overvalued because of people transferring their holdings for the upcoming fork. I think it's possible that BTC is still undervalued, and the market is realizing that.  We're correcting upward. 
I do anticipate a significant dip due to the uncertainty of the fork and that wigging out some of the short-term whales, though.  I just don't think it's a matter of correcting downward.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:19:26
Decide what you want to invest this month. Do half today, and half after the fork, regardless of price.  Best way to minimize risk during a period of uncertainty. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:22:56
If I were your friend, I wouldn't worry about all the splits in this situation.  They're risk free, and sure you can monitor and be smart and make a little extra to throw into BTC if you play it all smoothly.  But if I were going to be walking away from BTC for years and just letting things grow, I'd personally just leave it be, and if any of it happens to be worth anything in the future, it's all gravy. If not, I'm not out anything.  
I would set up an automatic weekly or bi-weekly (depending on pay periods in the military) transaction to buy a steady amount so my overall holdings are increasing and not just the fiat equivalent of my holdings.  
I would probably set up some "just in case" triggers automatic buys at certain price points in case it dips dramatically for any reason.  I might set up a bigger than my weekly contribution purchase if it hits 6.5K, bigger than that if it hits 6.25K, down and down. At the 5K level and below, setting up relatively significant purchases just in case.  
Holding is the right strategy.  But being away for years, your friend will be kicking themselves for not buying as well in the interim.  
I would also set up an automatic transfer from the exchange to a privately held wallet so that if anything happens to the exchange you're buying on in that period, you still own your bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:49:59
They're not exactly giving you free B2X. It's what you already own in Bitcoin actualized in B2X. They're forking from what already exists, if I understand correctly, so you're entitled to your holdings on both sides of *your* currency forking.  
Theoretically, B2X could replace Bitcoin, and Bitcoin could completely crumble.  In which case you're not doubling your crypto, you're getting what's already yours sent over to the "new Bitcoin."  Both coins are very unlikely to survive alongside one another. It's not just a new crypto they're incentivizing you to use by giving you free coin.  
You only actually increase your holding if you correctly identify which version will be the top dog, and you sell the other and transfer to it before it collapses.  That's why I'm betting on BTC and will be selling at least half of my B2X day of the fork and investing it in BTC. It's a bit of a gamble. Safest thing to do, since the new coin is risk free, is just hold both until a winner emerges. 
But I strongly anticipate Bitcoin coming out on top.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:20:56
No, they're just a market place. You're buying it from someone who is selling it. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:14:41
I'm a hodler, but if you're serious given what's at stake, my strong advice to you is to cash out periodically at ATHs and NEVER at lows. Get your initial investment back ASAP. 
To be safe I'd say cash out something like 10% every time you see 15% over the last time you cashed out. That way you're still holding through the booms, never actualizing a loss, and not putting all your eggs in one basket. 
If you wanted to be more reckless, I'd say it's certainty that we will see 25k within two years, very conservatively. If were me, I'd cash out small increments along the way, and recoup my entire initial investment at 25k. 
But NEVER invest more than you can lose and recover as a general principle. I do think you'll end up being happy you did this, but in terms of risk it's a very stupid move. Cover your bases as much as possible to safeguard against loss in case of setbacks. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:03:50
Good point! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:25:47
So, so, so glad I got over the "I've already waited too long, maybe it will dip again!" mentality.  I just kept watching it climb, until I finally bought in at 5.5K, and now less than a month later we're at 7K+.  I'd hate to be buying in now knowing I thought 5.5K was too much. 
And I know the longer I wait to increase my holdings, the more I'll regret not doing so at 7K when it's at 10, 12, 15, etc.  
If you believe in the platform, buy now, buy what you can afford each week or month, and don't try to chase the market.  If I avoided last month's ATH to buy, I'd have missed the fun of all these new ATHs! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:49:19
I'm pretty certain Bitcoin will prevail, but how much it crashes--if at all-- and for how long is a huge variable.  I'm sure a lot of people will make more money pumping and dumping bitcoin cash, and even grabbing Ethereum and Litecoin as it's falling while everyone hoards up in BTC for the fork then selling once people diversify again and it they return to normal.  
Are you planning on trying to buy and sell repeatedly during the highs and lows this month? Do you happen to know what's the fastest marketplace for buying and selling if I get emboldened enough to try and time the markets?

It's okay. Infinitely more secure than keeping them on Coinbase or equivalent.  Others will you tell you for more security you need to move them to a device completely offline or in a paper wallet.  
You will be able to claim the equal holding of B2X storing your BTC in Electrum, but you have to take action in order to so. I believe they just put up a "how-to" on their website.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:11:33

It may be internet money, but when people agree it's useful then it has value. Gold is just rock money. Oil is just liquid money. Dollars are just paper money. 
Turns out internet money is an actual resource. People are seeing massive returns, and this upward trend doesn't show any signs of slowing down over time.

Look at the value history, my man.  It was 180 per. It's 6K now.  He bought 6 BTC at 180.  You do the math.  
Or don't.  It doesn't make a difference to me if you become convinced and enjoy the ride or not as long as you're enjoying your life.  But a bunch of us are making some coin off this, so it works just fine for us.
