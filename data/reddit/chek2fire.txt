everyone know about the dangers. The strange is to see ppl in crypto world that dont know this.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:02:30
is anyone thinking that this bitfinex "hacking" maybe is an exit scam from them?
@_date: 2016-08-29 12:09:18
is great and you will learn how bitcoin works
@_date: 2016-08-28 23:59:13
lol :D
@_date: 2016-08-25 12:37:30
wait for a while and tha package will be out. Be patient. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:26:15
what about this for eth foundation?
@_date: 2016-08-15 12:00:03
has anyone experience with tor through vps?  
i always think to run tor in my bitcoin full nodes 
but i am afraid that vps provider will block my nodes
as i remember is somehow a reason to stop your server if the vps provider find that you run tor
and do i have to do anything to run tor, open a port etc or just run tor service and open the 8333 port of bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-16 00:41:56
i use time4vps. great prices and i host there my full bitcoin nodes
dont listen to anyone that says that bitcoin not need loyal full nodes.
Full nodes from ppl around the world is the last defence line for bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-17 20:03:40
i just get this scam email
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:44:10
i have buy some items from there. Great seller!
@_date: 2016-08-17 20:01:07
i just get this email too and it passes the spam filter of gmail
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:39:05
yes and always. The bitcoin will appear when your wallet sync
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:04:06
@_date: 2016-08-29 00:00:14
this is a bitpay problem not a bitcoin problem
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:20:24
we already know that :P
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:32:58
the sad is that ppl behind exchanges and startups are more idiots than users. We always see catastrophic mistakes from them.
How anyone can get them serious especially in the financial system.
This guys are jokes.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:23:31
bitgo dmg his reputation forever after this imo.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:57:42
is obviously that hard fork came from minority and has not consensus among all the ethereum ecosystem. Only 10% mining hashpower vote. The most of miner simple ignore the voting.
@_date: 2016-08-30 00:31:50
i have use them for almost a year but with not much money and i have never a single problem.
@_date: 2016-08-25 18:41:56
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:24:48
great! a solution from the same guys that Break ethereum :D lol :D
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:10:53
yeah. The same thing happen always to previous auction. A price spike one week before auction and a drop after
@_date: 2016-04-29 23:29:36
i think i will buy a doge cards :D
@_date: 2016-04-16 01:05:14
welcome to this crypto world. The only advice that i had to say is enjoy your journey but never trust your bitcoins to anyone.
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:27:27
i think Vitalik is just a stupid idiot that he convince others that is a smart :P
@_date: 2016-04-01 00:36:46
a trojan horse in their crap economical system
@_date: 2016-08-16 00:38:12
i will keep them to hardware wallets and i will donate a huge ammount to bitcoin devs, to charity, wikileaks etc
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:49:28
yes it works! :D
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:16:26
 a great tech visionary guy. Best Wishes! 
@_date: 2016-04-22 19:20:25
i dont care about your tiny hat but i can say that bitcoin is far more secure than anything else outthere and no one can control it or hijack it
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:49:36
what a ridiculous proposal is that? Bitcoin in not this ethereum shitcoin to act like that. 
The only way to stop this situations for ever is to everyone begin to use a p2p exchanges like bitsquare.
@_date: 2016-04-30 12:03:02
follow the discussion in twtiter. If you try to spent an unconfirmed transaction you must first wait to clear and after to spent it. I cant understand who is downvote me because is obvious that this guy is a liar and spread fud without reason. I dont who is supporting this idiots and how they think bitcoin will success with that personns as new bitcoin "leaders" /...
@_date: 2016-04-21 14:58:53
i dont think that this is a serious threat and that movement from MIT is simple ridiculous with no luck.
And this is the point why chinese miners is much better than to be in USA, a shadow country with much shadow agents.
This country is a danger to freedom. They say that they are a free contry but is simple a bunch of NSA, CIA idiots to control everything without any permission from anyone
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:20:11
because many ethereum supporters dont understand what a blockchain system really is and they think it is like a digital banking system with a middle man to decide about them and about their future. this is wrong. If anyone need a banking system there is no needing to use Vitalik system.
@_date: 2016-04-04 23:03:18
the real surprise is the investor. One of them is a German state bank. this is a big suprise!
@_date: 2016-04-07 12:44:41
What a crap article is that?
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:20:30
political noise is already behind us
@_date: 2016-04-10 00:17:44
what wallet was that?
@_date: 2016-08-17 22:59:14
the same thing i was thinking.It get me one hour to figure out how to run a tor full node and with a great help from bitcoin irc channel.
This are the steps that i was doing to setup my node.
@_date: 2016-08-17 22:59:55
i will appreciate a guide for Tails with a bitcoin node
@_date: 2016-04-24 01:14:05
bitcoin is always great
@_date: 2016-04-21 13:41:26
great wallet and one of the best in bitcoin ecosystem
@_date: 2016-04-23 23:43:50
i like this guy :D
@_date: 2016-04-22 20:12:36
how old are you? A country especially in the west world to spent above 10 billion must come from a political argument... wake up kid. this is real world. Is not like movies.
@_date: 2016-04-29 23:38:01
is definitely Kim Jong-un
@_date: 2016-04-08 19:18:24
Gz! Very ethic for BTCC. Gz again!
@_date: 2016-04-04 00:36:25
great wallets. I will buy one asap :)
@_date: 2016-04-16 01:02:40
i have buy some things as a wine from Italy, a handmade hat from use, a used vinyl from UK, a honey from bulgaria. I think ob is great for domestic products and for handmade.
@_date: 2016-04-14 00:39:29
Gavin has lost his reputation forever in bitcoin community with this ridiculous BitcoinXT and after that Classic movement.
The name was ridiculous, the tech details was ridiculous and the king is Naked...
He knew that he lost the game and that bitcoin developing to the hand of next gen
@_date: 2016-04-22 19:59:47
lol then they money you say is not enough :D
@_date: 2016-04-07 12:23:23
Dont use Coinbase. There are much better options like Circle or Kraken. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 11:38:52
Classic is Dead we dont have anything else to see here.
@_date: 2016-04-07 12:41:17
hardware wallets like ledgerwallet, trezor, keeypkey
@_date: 2016-04-22 21:09:31
@_date: 2016-04-22 17:45:24
there are hardware wallet or even cold wallet if you dont know how to secure your desktop or if you are not sure
@_date: 2016-04-22 19:25:20
for the history NSA or any other shit cant even close tor network or dark market and will close bitcoin network? hahahaha
@_date: 2016-04-03 00:17:46
@_date: 2016-04-22 13:14:27
nah i dont think so. The game is over for them and they know that. Even Armstrong from Coinbase support now lighting network or Gavin has return to core commit months after the last time. 
@_date: 2016-04-01 11:40:40
they all agree that the best solution is a block decrease to 500kb
@_date: 2016-04-07 12:43:57
The problem is that many ppl want cheap bitcoins for that all this FUD
@_date: 2016-04-23 11:41:19
if it was so easy then now we will have the Classic hard fork
@_date: 2016-04-23 23:44:44
i use spectrocoin card a year now without any problem at all and i have done many purchases around the world
@_date: 2016-04-23 12:24:53
lol :D
@_date: 2016-04-30 23:55:18
this is and my question. What the hell is doing this guy with that ppl like ver?
@_date: 2016-04-22 16:29:58
good luck with that. NSA and every nsa is powerless in p2p systems. Look at tor or look how snowden and wikileaks take funds when everyone block them or look at torrents. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 22:04:10
@_date: 2016-04-30 11:35:41
what a jerk is this guy. He tries to spent an unconfirmed transaction and the he blame bitcoin :P
@_date: 2016-04-22 19:23:27
how? can you tell me what they can do?
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:43:19
btc FTW! :)
@_date: 2016-04-21 21:06:20
Great news!!
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:44:28
@_date: 2016-04-01 00:39:05
buy several hardware wallet like ledgerwallet, trezor or keepkey 
@_date: 2016-04-16 01:17:49
lol hahahaha What is TransferWise?? who is using them?
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:07:47
becash is not p2p because controlled by only 3 guys. Is a central pre mined shitcoin that has zero benefit from other systems like Bitcoin, litecoin or even Dogecoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:39:38
swipe to the right the main page and you will go to another page with your btc address.
is not very clear this.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:38:08
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:54:35
because in most of them the biggest investors are Roger Ver or Jihad Wu, this two guys are the cancer of Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:28:31
finally works an for Greece! To the muon :D
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:22:29
stop the craps. Only idiots can support scammers like Roger Ver and Jihan Wu
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:46:52
yeah but is good to inform ppl about their practice.
I have already complain to all my vps providers for this expensive charges.
@_date: 2016-04-20 19:03:24
lol :D
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:36:15
and dogecoin has more transactions than becash. Roger Ver shitcoin is totally bullshit 
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:41:14
the point of bitcoin existence is not "fast and cheap" you idiot
@_date: 2016-04-24 00:31:04
me too :)
@_date: 2016-04-22 16:05:09
is ridicilous to believe someone that NSA can destroy bitcoin even if they has bitfury with 14% in their side. this is only fud
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:30:34
yeah the reason is simple if they add segwit they will lower the fees and then their ridiculous political game will failed.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:27:55
every day Roger Ver prove to everyone what a psycho is. Only lunatic will do such a waste of money. Whatever he do Bitcoin is Bitcoin and becash will always a premined shitcoin that forked from the original chain.
@_date: 2016-04-05 23:59:09
Bitcoin is always Great
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:12:07
i think everyone must stop pay so much attention to that idiots and focus to bitcoin. For what they do this guys looks like a bunch of charlatans. No one will take them serious.
@_date: 2016-04-29 23:35:41
they are not even ancap
@_date: 2016-04-26 00:01:54
great timing.. lol hahahahahahahahahahaha
@_date: 2016-04-22 20:20:31
to China
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:33:23
will be a celebration day to Bitcoin if this mining cartel of Jihad Wu will collapse.   
Btc.com/Antpool/Viabtc/BTC.TOP is exactly the same thing 
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:23:12
use other exchange. Coinbase set ridiculous high fee for unknown reason,. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:32:45
Finally Jihad Wu mining cartel will be over and bitcoin will be free and more decentralised again.  
No one will miss this idiots. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 22:31:00
101 times and we counting :D
@_date: 2016-04-22 16:46:47
lol this cant be in bitcoin world.private key is your own and only YOU can give them. No one can take it from you
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:51:03
the sad part of bitcoin is that lures every scammer and ridiculous ppl around it. Roger Ver, Jihad Wu are a great example of this.
@_date: 2016-04-25 23:41:02
not live in greece. Only in slovenia?
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:01:07
is there a guide to setup a lighting node?
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:47:48
is not 7 but 77 
@_date: 2016-04-29 23:33:04
Classic is dead. Segwit patch was the last nail in the coffin 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:36:54
who is this guy and why is important whatever he says?
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:25:07
bitpay is the worst bitcoin payment provider and i dont know how they are still do business. Someone must be a fool to still use this crap.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:31:34
Bitpay is completely crap and broken. Stop using them and ask your merchants to change their payment provider.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:35:18
you deserve this. gz!
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:05:48
yeah and thats the reason why everyone has turn his back to the becash shitcoin that controlled by 3 well known scammers Roger Ver, Crag Wright and Jihad Wu.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:50:47
i just do 3 payments with only 160 satoshi and first block confirmation.
What are you talk about?   
For the ridiculous fees from coinbase?
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:55:25
Very soon we will laugh for months with this idiots.  
They will learn why you need to invest to tech than to marketing in crypto space... :P  
And what a crap marketing ... 
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:45:49
Who is this guy if you compare him with Roger Ver, Craig Wright or Jihad Wu? :P
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:13:41
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:24:23
is this app only for usa citizens? 
@_date: 2016-04-03 00:17:19
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:50:11
and they still charge up to 10$ in every price with their ridiculous payment system.
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:52:34
this guys are completely becash supporters. Not expect them to add segwit support. they dont care imo.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:08:18
is a common knowledge to everyone especially to tech geeks that idiots not survive very long to a tech geek world.  
That will happen to Coinbase, Jihan Wu, Roge Ver, Bitpay and everyone else crap person or startup like them.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:26:58
but is not 15$ as they say. And 50satoshi that uses becash is astronomical to dogecoin or litecoin... :P
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:48:31
yeah the fees that is manipulated by the same 3 ppl that create and own bcash shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:47:40
have you ever use bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:47:36
yeah purse.io do a poll and in three hours they get 5k votes :P  
Purse.io seems to be the same popular like amazon :D  
what a crap :D   
and there are ppl like you that believe this bullshits....  
hahahahahahahaha  
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:27:33
why where is the price now?? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:00:42
the best proposal is to let them bankrupt and collapse under the fee pressure 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:54:05
Roger Ver is a guy with serious mental disease problems and every action of him prove this. Only a psycho will do something like this. He need a doctor asap. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:01:58
what is stripe?
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:11:07
and for that we must trust all the bullshits that said well known economist like Roger Ver, Craig Wright or Jihad wu? lol :P 
No thx. I will stick to the engineers.   
Internet was a pure social-economical phenomenal but engineers was them that built and develop it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:18:41
there is an eclair gitter here  
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:10:18
i agree with that and bitcoin developers must drop asap this "bitcoin core " ridiculous term. Is just Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:53:12
i am curious how you get to this conclusion. You must spent much of your iq to get there....
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:41:25
they are just of bunch of idiots. You cant hijack Bitcoin name because Roger Ver say so :P
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:49:51
this video is a great example why ppl to bitcoin ecosystem follows and trust engineers and not scammers hoaxers like Roger Ver that didnt even know how to write a :"hello World" code and has an opinion to pure tech problems 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:28:57
i dont see any danger there. They only prove how much ridiculous are this guys as persons. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:39:54
what kind of idiots believe that will hijack bitcoin name just like that?
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:04:33
because they are idiots. Their vision is bitcoin to collapse and replaced by a shticoin that they can easily control 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:50:57

@_date: 2018-01-16 20:56:59
yeah is not very clear and they need to add maybe a glass arrow . 
Both of the wallet needs to add more option because they are very simple as it is now
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:57:46
this seems a great place for the next years pizza day
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:18:09

@_date: 2019-07-13 17:53:10
blokchain lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:20:36
common ppl for sure will not buy bitcoin for Roger Ver or to scammers like him. 
@_date: 2019-07-22 00:11:54
retailers, small buyers come in to the crypto space and have a dream to get rich quickly.
They thought that shitcoins will save them... We know what happen next :D

@_date: 2017-12-24 23:33:36
Jihan's Wu-Bitmain mining cartel stop playing games with fees to bitcoin network. There is a huge problem to bitcoin mining right now
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:35:02
It seems Jihan Wu and his mining cartel has stop playing games with bitcoin network.The biggest problem to bitcoin is miining right now. The first step to solve this problem is somehow devs to brick antminers.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:28:21
and a reminder that this hoaxer is not even a Dr. His tittle is completely fake.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:50:50
i always say that the biggest problem to bitcoin is CEO's of big bitcoin startups.  
This guys has prove several times that are just a bunch of idiot kids that they dont have even a strategy to ecosystem.  
imo when the big players come to crypto world this idiots will disappear and in several years no one will remember them.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:03:23
unfortunately Reddit dont give the option to create votes here
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:47:51
bitcoin mining is the most serious problem to the network right now and not the fees 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:18:22
You are a Bitcoin Jesus

he deserve this. Andreas was the inspiration for all of us
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:43:18
is amazing that there are ppl that are still support scammers llike Roger Ver and Craig Wright.   
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:35:55
is not a waste of time to uncover a hoaxer scammer
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:08:40
you cant store important data to a shitcoin that controlled by 3 dudes. One with a known criminal past, one with with tech exploits and one well known hoaxer scammer. 
I will never trust my personal data to a system like this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:05:42
a big thanks to Andreas!!  
Keep walking dude.  
We deserve everything!
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:02:54
i always trust devs not scammers and hoaxers like Ver, Jihan and Wright
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:09:37
You can use Bitwala instead Coinbase. They use segwit addresses.  
You can use BitBaypay.com instead of bitpay. They use segwit addresses
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:53:02
because is the only coin that everyone want to use it
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:18:42
My feeling is that Openbazaar not want to support bitcoin payments in long term.  I see only the devs to says everywhere how great is every central shitcoin like bcash and in first change to fight bitcoin as a project.  
I never see your devs to support public ideas like segwit, lighting or something that help the bitcoin experience to your platform.  
As i say this project lost their way and vision.  
There is no way to support it anymore and i dont care if succeed or not.  
In the other hand i will be very surprised if exist ppl that want to sell their products for central control payments shitcoins like bcash.  
And why not then Paypal?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:36:33
Ι will suggest the "Smile of The Kids" in Greece  
They do an amazing job with kids that have health problems, economical problems or are victims of violence.  
  
    
  
Thank You!
  
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:50:19
yeah ok... :P
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:46:59
who cares about this psycho anymore? They have create their won shitcoin now and they can do with it whatever they want. No one cares

maybe is the time to someone fork this project and give it back the real idea behind it. I still think that there is a reason to exist a true decentralised anon project for open free market.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:32:05
no Jihad Wu, Roger Ver and Craig Wright reunion. Humanity will celebrate this day :P
@_date: 2018-09-24 17:03:17
there was no fork to 2013 but a blocckhain revert history
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:41:09
everyone must understand that Roger Ver has serious mental problem and need a doctor asap
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:53:30
yeah bitcoin always broken upwards :P
@_date: 2018-09-23 01:15:25
maybe you are the guy that believe everything so easy. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:04:45
Is impossible a miner to do an attack with this bug. It will be like a suicide because it will have zero effect to the main bitcoin chain. His block will be rejected from the network asap.
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:48:53
There is no proof that this guy have found the bug. This guy is only a bcash shitcoiner that try to exploit a political propaganda against bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:30:00
Bitpay act like they are desperate to go to bankrupt. They had no logic everything they do the last 3 months.
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:18:47
there is not "both sides"
There is Bitcoin and a dozen of forks of it. Nothing more nothing less 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:11:10
is sad to see a former great reputation exchange to craped like this :(
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:54:53
the most of bitcoin startups is like run by teenagers. Coinbase and GDax are worst example of this.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:50:40
Who is so idiot to follow this bunch of scammers?
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:40:22
yeah i am more genius. I have keep my bitcoin and not lost a single value of them. This idiot have already lose 500mil dollars. Who is the idiot again?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:54:52
you cant kill something like bitcoin especially if you are an idiot like Armstrong and all of this jerks like him
@_date: 2018-09-21 01:04:14
it seems the problem is more serious than i thought. I will start to sync my nodes from scratch to find out if a miner already create an invalid block. Is the only way to found out this. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:05:26
tell them to ask you again in one month. The same question has one guy before at 8k
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:38:43
do i say that everyone around bcash is a fraud and scammer or not?
@_date: 2018-09-15 23:49:08
This is not suprise. We already know that bcash is another crap fork of bitcoin as dozens of others. The only special to this fork is that it has a fake Satoshi as a leader and a bunch of scammers as promoters. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:01:35
Roger Ver is a jerk.   
@_date: 2018-09-29 23:21:09

to shutdown a scam is not censorship. 
[Bitcoin]( come scam wallet misleading and confuse the newcomers to something that is not bitcoin but an altcoin.
This is a pure scam.
@_date: 2018-09-24 21:21:25
I have already read it. they have forked from the network with the one billion bitcoin with them. I know that this true story dont fit to your bcash propaganda about "many forks" of Bitcoin.0 Bitcoin has never fork and will never fork. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:30:27
first time i see that they troll bcash. I have several times donate to them but i dont remember to see it again.
@_date: 2018-09-24 19:02:26
you are wrong. There is fork with the billion flaw bitcoin and the current same chain that is revert back. The flaw forked chain have died because no one like to have a dogecoin version of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:54:55
gz! great work!
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:33:00
And what have to do bcash with Bitcoin? Bcash is another fork of bitcoin like dozens of other forks. If they want equality then must enable and bitcoin gold and the other forks. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 20:33:43
@_date: 2015-12-11 01:54:57
Wright is a scammer and has nothing to do with bitcoin. This is a fact now
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:25:55
+1 for the doge sci-fi pic :D
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:00:05
yes the Bank and financial system is behind BitcoinXT project. Is simple. We see it in the Hearn case and where he work now. All of them want to transform bitcoin as a small part of financial system. Bitcoin came to revolution this system not to be a small part of it
@_date: 2018-09-08 00:25:33
it looks like fake
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:03:40
yeah because Steam has choose the worst payment provider out there....  
Bitpay  
They dont even add segwit support to lower the fees.  
G2A has drop this crap bitpay long ago and now they use BitBayPay.com that has segwit support.  
Bitpay deserves to bankrupt. They are only spent their resources to support every shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:42:44
Bitcoin.com has transform to a shitcoin site.
@_date: 2018-09-15 23:45:43
Jihad Wu is the most stupid person in crypto world. He has huge profits from Bitcoin and one day he decides to turn against Bitcoin, just for the lulz.
Epic Fail :D
@_date: 2015-12-28 22:27:14
It simple. Banks want to take control of bitcoin core with BitcoinXT. Nothing more nothing less
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:20:39
This article is total garbage and another prof that bcash shitcoin will only survive with political propaganda blame against bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-10 01:02:58
this guy is not Satoshi. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 20:31:06
what is your opinion about R3 project and private blockchains and what is your opinion about the fork movement from ex-bitcoin developer Mike Hearn?
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:57:32
Who cares about a bitcoin Bank like Coinbase and where is decentralisation that Antonopoulos talk so much about? If Coinbase want they can create another site like bitcoin.org. And if didnt have admins the power of their site who has?
@_date: 2015-12-11 01:56:05
Kleiman has nothing to do with the creation of bitcoin. When was in hospital Satoshi was still very active in bitcoitalk forum
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:26:30
companies built around bitcoin because there is a huge demand of using and spent and for sure not happen the opposite.
You think that you will find ppl  whiling to use and spent this bcash shitcoin? lol... :D
Good luck with this and have a happy new year :D
@_date: 2015-12-11 01:58:18
I think this is legit

I will always support anyone against Coinbase or a bitcoin bank like that
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:21:41
it seems that was smple a luck spike nothing more
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:23:38
why you say that?
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:18:04
accepted from whom? because dogecoin has much more usage than bcash shitcoin and much more active addresses atm.
@_date: 2015-12-12 01:48:15
hahahaha What a scammer :P
@_date: 2015-06-29 00:32:17
very nice shop :)
@_date: 2018-09-28 23:39:54
imo this major bug fix release need and a major release number.
Is a kind of psychology users to upgrade to major number releases and ignore the minor numbers even if the major number has zero changes. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 10:59:53
How is "original"? Because the original message was from email and digital form.. :P

great! this time we will have a real AMA because one month now when i read AMA i think is to the bitcoin.com forum

today i have pay a bundle with btc
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:45:31
yeah they search for a real developer now :P
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:29:18
Αν έχεις χρεωστική κάρτα η κάρτα ανάληψης από τράπεζα δοκίμασε να κάνεις αγορά μέσω του Circle
τις κάρτες ανάληψης της δέχεται κανονικά. Αν και είναι ποιο ακριβό από το να κάνεις αγορά μέσω sepa είναι μονόδρομος πλέον για αγορά bitcoin μετά το capital control που επιβλήθηκε και που απαγορεύει την μεταφορά χρημάτων στο εξωτερικό.
Αν μπορούσες να κάνεις μεταφορά μέσω sepa η καλύτερη λύση είναι το kraken.com
@_date: 2015-12-03 15:56:30
and what then? Ah you talk about windows ok.. :P
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:45:12
why we have to care what name have this shitcoin?
@_date: 2015-12-02 01:55:37
@_date: 2015-12-29 14:04:29
they are simple supporting bitcoint to be small part of financial system and not a revolution of it
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:56:26
of course because there is not a single bcash developer out there. Only a bunch of idiots and scammers.  
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:33:41
and where is your website?
@_date: 2015-06-18 11:18:39
It has some mistakes.
In the third line 
"- Είναι ένα άτομο σε άτομο ψηφιακό χρήμα" 
is completly confusing. I think it better to keep the english p2p rather than "ατομο προς άτομο" 
In the next line and here 'δεν μπορεί να ελέγξει bitcoin' must be 'δεν μπορεί να ελέγξει **το** bitcoin και **τα** bitcoin σας δεν μπορούν να" the next "παγώσει" is not correct. The word "παγώσει" is not using in greeks. I think the best option in this line is to completly remove the 'και bitcoin σας δεν μπορεί να παγώσει"
In the laste line you must add an "To Bitcoin" in the begining and you must remove "η της νύχτας' If you say in greece "όλη την ημέρα" is meaning "all the day"
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:37:33
Yes is very good now! In my opinion is better to change the "συνάλλαγμα" το "νόμισμα"&gt; In Greece when you say money is trasnlated νομισμα.
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:27:19
they openly try to manipulate the price
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:07:33
and all of them are from facist far right Lepen party in France .. What a surprise....
@_date: 2015-12-14 00:36:41
The price of bitcoin will rise if more people use it and not if more people hold it
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:50:40
yeah unfortunately every hacker in this planet has their eyes to Coinbase right now
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:09:39
I think the best will be this
* -Δεν χρειάζεται τράπεζα για να το χρησιμοποιήσετε
* -Είναι ένα p2p ψηφιακό χρήμα
* -Καμία κυβέρνηση δεν μπορεί να ελέγξει το Bitcoin και κανένας δεν μπορεί να παγώσει τον Bitcoin λογαριασμό σας
* -Το Bitcoin μπορεί να χρησιμοποιηθεί οποιαδήποτε ώρα της μέρας και μπορεί να αποσταλεί οπουδήποτε στον κόσμο.
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:52:42
i was very surprise back then who is so idiot to buy this shitcoin at this range of price.  
Now i have found that was Bitmain and Jihad Wu. lol :P
@_date: 2015-12-10 00:59:17
Great article!! gz! thsi story with Wright as Satoshi is completely fake!

@_date: 2018-08-25 23:34:15
this guy has even fake phd 
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:25:43
there is not any social attack. Bcash is simple a fork off the bitcoin network like dozen of other. There is nothing special to it and there is no reason anyone to see it as "equal" to  bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:50:32
when i sold my bcash shitcoin i was always thinking who was so idiot to buy them and to that range of price.  
It seems the answer was... Jihad Wu :D
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:36:48
....and 100% lunatic
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:44:15
anyone know where is blockchain.info with segwit?
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:53:04
the tittle is false. Will not pre-installed but will be in their app store. Is not big deal that a bitcoin app get to their app store.
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:57:43
and bcash was found from a single asian guy. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:45:53
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:00:23
The best good thing about bcash fork is that all of this clowns left bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:57:01
one great thing about bcash is that all of this idiots, lunatics, hoaxer and con artists leave bitcoin forever. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:24:02
imo he must never fix it and let it crap their crap system.  
Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and Craig Wright deserve this.
@_date: 2018-08-06 14:38:35
and dozen of others like this community is high ranking to google. If ppl decide to buy or to start use bitcoin they will buy bitcoin or start to use bitcoin. Nothing more nothing less.  
And ignore Roger Ver. Is a guy with serious mental problems that will always talk and act loud. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:15:35
bitcoin core lol :P. What is the name for Bitcoin that ppl use with knots or bcoin? BitcoinKnots or Bitcoinbcoin? Roiger Ver has a serious mental problem and need a doctor asap.
@_date: 2018-08-20 18:29:27
this is a pure scam
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:30:25
And why bitcoin.org have not add and the misleading scam, something that Roger Ver do with his supported shitcoin?  
@_date: 2018-08-16 11:30:48
i am curious what happen with Blockchain.info and segwit. they said before one year that will enable segwit in the first quarter of 18. We are near the last months of the years and still nothing. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 23:36:02
bcash was a trash from the beginning. Nothing new here. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:34:04

none. Only this psycho Roger Ver and his payed puppets
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:45:09
Is a great example how a bitcoin pioneer transform to a totally crap startup that no one want to use anymore.
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:22:19
and what is the big deal to keep their promise that they will enable segwit the first quarter of 201&amp;?
@_date: 2018-08-25 23:35:37
because they are idiots
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:12:53
but for sure the  ppl that sue Roger Ver will get some free money from him
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:05:07
To be fair this claim is not mine but is see to talk about it to 8btc.com forum
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:14:55
you dont need to do it directly but if you know that Bitmain buy huge stake and willing to buy every bcash to the market you just sell them to the market. I am sure that both of them has still their bitcoins and that Bitmain left with one million useless bcash that they cant even sell to the market without collapse this shitcoin to zero value.   
This is a very sophisticated heist imo.

Is very easy to prove that you pay the money. Remember that they dont accept a payment from replace by fee transaction.  
I had the same experience and they refund my Bitcoin after two months. 
Contact them to their bitflyer japan support. If you prove that you do the payment then they will return your bitcoin to the wallet.

Blockchain.info has not even enable segwit. What a crap.

the best way to support bitcoin now is to run a full node. Is not difficult. The only think you need is to enable upnp option in bitcoin-qt wallet and the same in your router and ofcourse to have a  good internet line.

I have done two investments to BTCjam and both of them take my bits and never give them back.
BTCJam imo is the worst platform for investment because anyone without any verification can ask for a loan.
Instead bitlendingclub is far more good option because the users to ask for a loan they need a full personal verification
@_date: 2014-09-04 14:22:50
take a look and to greek bitcointalk forum and to our site

BtcJam is a scam fest. Anyone without any verification can ask for money and scam people and btcjam it seems that didnt care about that to protect the investors.

but as we read in this proposal this scenario that yous is not possible because in segwit case miners will just ingore segwit transactions and will mark them as valid. Even nodes that not upgrade to segwit code will do this.
Will be the same situation that will happen and after a soft fork. The old nodes will still relay blocks and transactions even if it is segwit.

Great post and i agree that we need this User Activation soft fork to come out asap.
Bitcoin innovation not deserve to be blocked by a single guy in this case Jihan because he is angry or he lost his panda or whatever.  
Because there is not any other reason a miner to block a tech proposal. 
And it seems he is not alone. Even F2pool has block segwit to bitcoin but and to litecoin.  
The most puzzle for me is that and devs are silent about UASF three days after the proposal.

yeah i am waiting this too. this conspiracy lunatics that support BU is better to fork themselves from bitcoin forever.
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:49:18
miners is not the heart of bitcoin but users. They can fork the newtork and create their own chain but without users
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:52:34
user activation is not change anything but is a free and decentralised option for someone to use whatever he want.
If you dont want segwit you will never use it and the network will remain the same.  
is a win-win situation.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:10:08
miners is a threat against bitcoin network and we must get rid off them asap. We dont need them but they need us to give value to their mining tokens.   
Miners is to work for the network not all bitcoin community to work for them. Miners are not the Rulers of the network!

the fees is high because price is rising.  This problem will increasing in future if the price continue to rise and sooner or later will need a solution. 
maybe segwit is a solution for this.

you can use whatever you want. before that find some time and read this proposal... :P  
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:51:47
it seems for some miners is better to risk this with BU than with a one year tested code like segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:47:57

I was a new customer to BtcJam but i will never spent money there . If you want to keep your customers you need to improve the project somehow.
In bitlendingclub i have done 10 investments until now and all of them has paid in time.

great guy in bitcoin ecosystem. 
I wish to continue to be an active member of bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 13:19:56
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:00:02
i dont think so is a valid scenario that you said. If you read the message it says  
Soft forks are still entirely optional to use post activation. For example, with P2SH, many participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem still do not use P2SH. Only 11% of bitcoins[2] are stored in P2SH addresses at the time of writing.   
in other hand is a question like this in bitcoin dev list and i think the nest days we will have clear answer about what problems can happen with this proposal and if is safe.  
I like the idea miners not to have such a power to set the rules of Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:19:49
This is an action of war from miners against bitcoin community.  
Their action are against bitcoin and we must see them as a threat to the network.  
Miners is to serve the network and not to be defacto rulers of it.  
We must defend bitcoin network from them and we must prepare a plan b to get rid off them.  
even to sabotage them everyday.  
@_date: 2017-02-26 11:59:03
is not a problem. this miner can still not want to activate segwit and never use it.Eve the users. The rest that want it can activate it and use it just fine without any risk to the system. is a win-win situation.
@_date: 2017-02-27 19:32:15

@_date: 2016-03-01 21:44:01
It is a spam attack every one know this and is the best proof why we need a block limit. And i dont see any solution if we simple raise the block size. Even in that spam attack situation the mining pools keep creating blocks with almost 40% of them empty. How they will change that if we have more mb in blocks?
@_date: 2017-02-14 14:34:07
i dont think so
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:00:45
No. There was an organized attack to bitcoin ecosystem. The attacker was some guys who sent thousand micropayments to bitcoin network and the same time CEO of this Coinbitch Brian Armstrong spread fud for bitcoin. 
The propose of all of this of course was the bitcoin price and someone to get easy money.
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:44:49
yeah full nodes validate blocks and transactions.  
Is the main reason why anyone must run a full node. This helps the network against malicious actions like invalid BU blocks.
@_date: 2016-03-14 12:44:03
great! 
@_date: 2016-03-02 13:47:36
the solution is not to simple raise the block size. This is temporary solution. The only true solution will be something like thin blocks or something like bitcoin ng propose. Bitcoin because and the most popular crypto is and the first that face this problem. And i think all the crypto will face it.

We not need miners for a decision.  
There is already a great post for this proposal in bitcointalk forum  
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:53:07
yes there is a scenario like this if a malicious miner do it but is not clear until now. I hope bitcoin developers has an opinion about this problems because three days now we dont have any response from them for this proposal.  
Is a pure tech proposal and me and you need more tech scenario analysis how this proposal will work in real conditions.  
If is worth and safe why not to do it?  
The majority seems to want segwit to activate it. why we need to keep innovation back because a single person in this case Jihan want to block it for political reasons?   
@_date: 2016-03-16 01:32:35

i agree with that. some miners has decide to begin playing with the fire.  
The situation is that they are so stupid that they dont even understand that this actions can bring a catastrophic disaster to bitcoin.  
the rest of bitcoin community must somehow act and defend bitcoin from this morons.  
we must prepare a plan b to get rid off this miners.  
and with this situation we must accept that segwit will never activate in bitcoin.

imo the situation is more worst and as bitcoin community we have do get off them as a malicious threat.

I am curious where they hide all of them when a bitcoin price disaster happen from their actions. Because from sure many ppl will look for them after that.  
and i think is time to prepare a plan b to get rid off them.

they are clear a threat against bitcoin and from now we all must see them like this.

i say every day in every forum, chat, slack the same thing. Bitcoin is about freedom and not to only buy fast a cup of coffee. We have already learn this recent in Greece and they have learn this in the past in Cyprus, Wikileaks,
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:45:00
human stupidity 
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:41:04
i think the main reason for price increase was a butterfly flight in Malabo.
My thoughts has much more logic than yours in tech and mathematical terms.
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:24:42
this is exactly what you see and is organised from one of the "brilliant" minds in bitcoin ecosystem.... Roger Ver....
@_date: 2016-03-26 14:19:42
for europe there is amazon.co.uk to buy it. I think i will buy one from there.
@_date: 2016-03-29 23:35:32
nah was just outside our door all of this time :P
@_date: 2016-03-23 01:41:32
yeah is the same team that develop bitcoin from the beginning. That for the history. Stay with your lovely fiat banking money man. This is not a world for you..
@_date: 2016-03-27 17:03:21
i can sent you give me your bitcoin adress?
@_date: 2016-03-16 16:09:25
yeah very strange in few hours such dramatical drop
@_date: 2016-03-10 17:38:17
Because when you leave your bitcoin in a cloud wallet is not yours. Especially when you left them to Coinbase one with the worst reputation in bitcoin ecosystem.
If you afraid for your desktop or mobile security buy a hardware wallet like the ledgerwallet. Is cheap and very good.
@_date: 2016-03-28 12:53:39
I am very sure no one will ever create a song for ethereum or any other altcoin or for Vitalik :P
@_date: 2016-03-26 00:56:49
I also love OpenBazaar! is a great project!
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:37:45
Only the Classic team knows who spread all that fud. Is clear now that this guys simple want to destroy bitcoin not to scale it. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 13:48:29
The fee market is a necessary part of bitcoin ecosystem. If you say that we dont need fee market then you dont know nothing how bitcoin works
@_date: 2017-02-20 00:49:15
he sounds like a pure BU supporter :D
@_date: 2016-03-27 16:32:42
if it ever working in real conditions tell me.. :P The "ten of thousands lines of code" is not create a working project.
@_date: 2016-03-02 13:49:17
can we keep to talk for what happen now? For that is the limit even to email to cut the spam
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:53:53
I already do this. Is clear that this company attack Bitcoin, spread fud and want to destroy it. I tell to everyone i know not to use this scam company and that there is so many better option in bitcoin ecosystem
@_date: 2016-03-16 01:29:48
Bitcoin network is under sybil attack atm. We have 1137 (13.84%) nodes from a single provider Choopa, LLC
and next we have 917 (11.16%) nodes from Amazon.com, Inc.
@_date: 2016-03-10 18:17:38
And how you think that Coinbase has a "good" reputation in bitcoin ecosystem when they block accounts or when they spread fud against bitcoin every day?
How can anyone will trust them? And i talk like a previous customer of them with many bitcoins in their wallet and a exchange user of them.
There are much better option in bitcoin ecosystem that this silly company that they dont even protect the product than supposed to work with.
I dont think YOU ever use their service or you ever have any bitcoins to them. Do you?
@_date: 2016-03-07 02:37:27
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:49:16
We all have to tell a big thx for this situation to Coinbase, Armstorng, Xapo, Jeff Garzik etc
We all will remember them how they "help" bitcoin in this time....
@_date: 2016-03-15 01:58:09
Do you know how many times we fell that lose faith in this epic 6 years journey with Bitcoin?
Was not an easy road to came here where bitcoin it is and will not an easy journey for the next years.
We all know this.
Revolution especially in the banking and economical sector will be no easy.
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:55:51
your mining farm and your economical nodes will run UASF code, BIP 148 as proposed from ShaolinFRy?
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:55:00
Hearn is back. Why he dont stay to his new scam R3 company?
@_date: 2016-03-27 17:50:16
yeah 1 confirm is ok but with microtransactions and a zero confirm is ok but many wallets needs 1-3 confirm so you can spend them again. What wallet you use?
@_date: 2017-03-03 01:47:21
Bitcoin has made history guys!
@_date: 2017-02-16 13:26:57
and for sure in one month will be not the miner leader when authorities try to regulate bitcoin mining in China
@_date: 2016-03-02 00:13:00
ok then the next thing to do is to tell us how good is the movies copyrights.
@_date: 2016-03-09 22:41:42
Coinbase must change their policy and their marketing because they cant work like this and blame the product that they suppose to work with.
@_date: 2016-03-03 12:39:19
only for testing:) this is not real :D
@_date: 2016-03-28 11:57:30
there is no blockchain system without tokens and imo R3 will never create a system like that. Is over a year now from announcement and until today we have not seen any private blcockchain working system in real economy.. Dogecoin blockchain system has much more value from that crap scam systems like R3. Is scammers that get easy money from Banks and goverments. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:34:43
this guy is for sure a payed shadow puppet. We need only to found from whom is payed. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:18:44
Great! From an ancap governance system BU will trasform Bitcoin to a Republican system :D
I will vote for Trump as the new president.
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:50:18
bitcoin is not democracy but a consensus anarchist system.
@_date: 2017-02-04 02:08:52
this is old
@_date: 2016-03-27 16:58:11
yeah great track!
@_date: 2016-01-13 14:40:51
Gz! Is amazing what you have done. I remember you have come to my country Greece when we are one step before the economical collapse.
What is your opinion for Greece for the country the people etc :)?
@_date: 2016-03-15 02:07:57
i agree with this. Classic is a sybil attack and a hijack attempt to bitcoin from financial corporations. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 00:33:10
great music!
@_date: 2016-03-14 01:58:24
Copay is a very good option because it works everywhere mobile, dekstop etc. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 23:09:00
Unfortunately there will be no other recording from this meeting and was a great speech of Antonopoulos as always. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 13:09:57
great song. I think is the best song for bitcoin until today. Satoshi Nakamoto is our new cyber punk Jesus in this new tech era
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:02:41
dont get serious a bunch of conspiracy lunatics.
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:14:22
Not anyone forget that Ver is a common criminal. 
He goes to jail by selling explosives and sent them through public aviation.  
And for sure this guys is not ancap but a common criminal hungry for power. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:55:01
we will all remember this period of bitcoin and especially how the Classic team act. They act like a mafia, Spread lies, fud and act like an organized zerg with only propose to destroy bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:05:34
What ridiculous is that vote system! Everyone can vote there even Dimon or Trump or an email bot. Classic want to destroy bitcoin governance from consensus to a ridiculous vote system and transform bitcoin to a Dodgecoin. Epic Fail!
@_date: 2016-03-29 16:04:45
@_date: 2016-03-27 19:19:55
a nice wallet the electrum. For your mobile i propose you Copay 
@_date: 2016-03-15 12:42:46
Yes there is. If a large part of the nodes controlled by single person or by single server provider there is a danger to discover the ip behind the bitcoin transactions or to do malicious dmg to the network. Nodes in bitcoin network is very important part of it and has a big role in the ecosystem. Many ppl dont know this
@_date: 2016-03-26 12:05:12
We have not ever make a rule in Bitcoin world someone to spy us or someone to create a new paypal system. Bitcoin world dont need them.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:51:45
I dont know why he do this but is very clear that Roger Ver's only propose is not to find consensus but to split bitcoin community and destroy bitcoin as a decentralised system. I dont know who pay him to do this but for sure we will  remember him as the Bitcoin Judas.  
He deserve this title
@_date: 2016-03-23 12:13:57
and what "vote" system can we use? Bitcoin has nothing to do with democracy. Is ancap system with a 100% consensus among users.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:13:23
is very stupid for miners to think that they can stop a technology.  
Lighting network will evolve even if BU hard fork happen, even to their BU forked chain.  
In the other hand to protect their profit they can simple be part of this innovation and not against it. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:50:09
how this when BU is untested and has so many flaws in it?
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:24:51
bitcoin.com belongs to Roger Ver. CANOE i dont know if belong to Jihan but the other for sure it belongs to him.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:00:07
nothing will happen if the nodes still run with consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:50:26
miners like the opportunity that give them BU to become the OPEC of Bitcoin fees.
With BU they can control block size forever and to keep the fees high.
Not anyone fooled from them that their interest is to raise bitcoin blocks. They only want to keep the fees high even if more transactions happen in the future and ofcourse not to lost this market with transaction layers like LN
@_date: 2016-03-02 00:11:28
The point is that with bitcoin unit i can buy  anything or i can transfer my money anywhere. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 02:03:01
I agree with that. There is no other explanation for this recent hysteria especially from guys like Armstrong expect the manipulation of bitcoin price
@_date: 2016-03-17 16:03:21
techcrunch is the same that before two or three days inform us for the "death" of bitcoin..
@_date: 2016-03-26 01:44:24
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:54:10
i have use them many many times as a customer and the experience was 100% positive. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 18:23:28
what about Circle? or exchanges like kraken?
@_date: 2016-03-14 00:51:05
i read this telegraph article until i get to this point "double spending attacks", a form of manipulation where the same money is paid to two different people. One of them is tricked and receives nothing. The victim has no legal recourse."
is obvious that financial system didnt know anything how this tech works and that they are still very blind about what blockchain system is.
I am very sure that scammerws will get party with them and get some easy money with "blockchain" private system that will be simple a database :D
@_date: 2016-03-29 17:52:59
Investors already dont use bitcoin. Bitcoin is used from problematic countries around the world like Argentina, Brazil, Greece, China etc and from people that believe to that. With only 21mil coins you dont need investors to setup a value. The only thing you want is the system to work. 
In that area they are very weak to do something. The system will continue to work. Instead their system will be vaporwave forever.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:57:07
i hope this exploit to exposed after BU fork. Is not fair that they do it now :D
@_date: 2016-03-29 17:43:27
Imo a hardware wallet like ledgerwallet, trezor, keepkey or if you know hot to secure your desktop, mobile etc use a the bitcoin core wallet or copay.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:59:10
yeah but does someone take some time to explain them?  
Because i see that they are desperate to protect their profit from fees. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 14:50:36
i think all the bitcoin community and bitcoin developer is in the big block camp but..
is not the right time bitcoin to do a huge block scale..because for the problem of node capacity, block transmission etc. The technology internet lines, cheap hard disk for home usage etc is not ready for that scale.
@_date: 2016-03-27 17:37:48
I just sent you one dollar in bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:04:55
great article
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:46:24
the Bitcoin Classic vote system is epic fail
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:14:56
yeah...whatever... :P
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:27:38
no is not because segwit is backward compatible.  
Only a rogue or a malicious miners can do a hard fork by proposal.  
but this is how economical bitcoin system survive 8 years now.  
if anyone or even a miner want to fork the network then is free to do it. For sure he can lost much more than any other user from this movement. 
The real question here is this...  
Do we need a king or a ruler in Bitcoin as Jihan seems want to be? 
Or we need a healthy decentralised bitcoin system that miners are here only to serve the network and not to rule it? 
If the answer is the second then we must revolt against this and take the situation to our hands.  
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:13:49
nothing difficult. 
We can only fork bitcoin core code, add this activation patch, setup a day and run the new nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:11:17
May The Force Be With You Charlie :)
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:23:04
this guys will not get consensus not even 1million years :D
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:44:22
But segwit will enable more transactions and not less.  
If you mean lighting network is not needing segwit to work and already there are many testnet with it.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:53:41
I really like to see what miners will do with their asics and mining farms if Bitcoin or BTU or BTCC cost 1$ each :D 
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:01:24
bitcoin is not only the miners
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:04:05
yes but this spam attack is an the main reason about block limit. 2mb or even bigger block size will not solve this problem especially when miners create 40% empty blocks 
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:26:52
who cares what they believe especially the Wrightamoto puppet Gavin?  
Only the market can decide who will be the Bitcoin. 
And for sure not miners or clones like this two guys.
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:40:59
I think no one really care what BU will do and many ppl wish BU to fork off from bitcoin network and create their own altcoin.
Bitcoin will be more healthy without:
MIning Centralisation from China
Non tech guys like Ver that corrupt everyday Bitcoin ecosystem
Users that think Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies is another better paypal or Visa
Bitcoin have a bright future and the best developers in crypto world. There are so many ideas that will develop freely after BU fork that will exploit Bitcoin ecosystem with innovation.
With the fork situation many of us will have the opportunity for few days to buy some cheap coins.
@_date: 2016-01-24 14:31:27
Gz! 
@_date: 2016-03-16 01:37:52
I will get this! Great Bundle with great games.
@_date: 2016-01-23 14:15:36
who cares what dimon do?
@_date: 2016-03-09 15:57:55
Dont use Coinbase. This is the company with the worst reputation in bitcoin ecosystem. Especially his CEO is one of the most bitcoin haters and i dont know why they work with bitcoin or in cryptospace.
@_date: 2016-03-10 17:43:51
is the first time that i have see a scam conference.
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:17:35
is not fair to be against chinese ppl. many from china bitcoin community supports bitcoin core.
@_date: 2016-01-29 01:07:26
I agree with that! Bitcoin is from anarchist movements and has nothing to do with democracy.
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:12:39
i only see 500-600 BU nodes. what is your point? and why pruned nodes is better than a full node??
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:45:22
Why bitcoin developers are so silent about this proposal and three days now they are not saying something to support or against this??  
is very strange imo.  
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:30:13
for sure their ministry of propaganda will be Roger Ver
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:26:07
who is this?
@_date: 2016-01-31 00:15:11
who knows. Because then he cant harm bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:43:48
and for a solution miners choose to have the role of OPEC in mining fees forever?  
Because with BU they can lobby the block size so they can keep fees high
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:27:56
yeah there is a specific problem that look until today after months that someone notice to be solved  
  
  
  
can i ask you now how you solve this problem? And not forget that BU use 98% of bitcoin core. this means is core with an addition of some serious flaws.In the other hand everyone is free to start mining or using his altcoin and i hope Jihan and Bitmain do this asap.
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:24:02
and what the problem if chinese, usa, europe pakistan or whatever guys has in his hands the hashpower of bitcoin network? Is the Chinese people act like a zerg all together because they are simple Chinese?
@_date: 2016-03-26 01:47:26
Coinbase and companies like them dont belong to Bitcoin world.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:31:35
nothing.. but this is the MAGIC because he is an elect president and he can do whatever he want :P
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:56:39
the risk is to have the next day two separate blockchains and two incomplete different bitcoin versions. This will be ena economical disaster for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-12 15:22:09
we will see a 60% increase of capacity with segwit and is to the developer plan for 2mb hard fork around 2017
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:27:12
is really a puzzle to me how a guy with a graduate from that a great university has so poor deep understanding in game theory and economics. The only i can think is that this University is not so great or it so corrupt that anyone with a proper "payment" to get easy his graduate.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:46:03
i really like to see what this Miners especially Jihan will do his asics if Bitcoin or BTU or BTCC or whatever cost 1$ each :D  
I have some ideas like to transform them to a tech Museum :P
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:24:58
a private version to a system that is full of flaws... good luck with that... :P
@_date: 2017-02-04 01:59:43
there is an elephant in the room and is the denial of miners to signal segwit. Bitcoin developers cant ignore this anymore.
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:02:00
Great article and a reminder to anyone that they need to run a full node asap. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:50:48
this "someone can steal your segwit coins" i think is the same sa that someone can steal in the future your multisig coins
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:15:54
is not a dictatorship one guy to block bitcoin innovation?
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:41:13
I think no one really care what BU will do and many ppl wish BU to fork off from bitcoin network and create their own altcoin.
Bitcoin will be more healthy without:
MIning Centralisation from China
Non tech guys like Ver that corrupt everyday Bitcoin ecosystem
Users that think Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies is another better paypal or Visa
Bitcoin have a bright future and the best developers in crypto world. There are so many ideas that will develop freely after BU fork that will exploit Bitcoin ecosystem with innovation.
With the fork situation many of us will have the opportunity for few days to buy some cheap coins.
@_date: 2019-03-25 00:40:32
yeah we already know that... 
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:18:31
and Bitcoin Judas want this crap to be the majority.  
I am sure that this guys are payed puppets with a hidden agenda to destroy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:52:24
this is exactly and our question... :P
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:54:37
who cares?
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:15:45
maybe is the better solution for them but again is temporarily.
The "problem" with blockchain system is that fees not calculate in fiat money but in kb and for sure in the near future storj will have the same fee problem and to ethereum.  
I think a solution like sidechains or lighting network will fit better for them.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:47:43
as everyone before understands what really bitcoin is
@_date: 2016-03-27 23:10:33
One pic from this event
and here
@_date: 2016-03-02 13:45:14
 with all of this FUD and lies that you spread for 6 months now
@_date: 2016-01-12 15:45:55
no is not but because this sigwit increase is inside the 1mb block. the size of the block will keep the same plus we will avoid the hard fork risk
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:39:48
not forget anyone that Bitcoin Unlimited want to setup and a President for bitcoin :P
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:20:50
thx for your answer, Capital controls was a great opportunity for more Greeks to learn about bitcon and new crypto economy :)
@_date: 2016-01-23 14:21:59
one more racist comment! Chinese is not a zerg communtiy. i think all of them that talk about chinese ppl will not have problem if 51% of hashrate was in Usa guys or White ppl...
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:24:41
you really dont understand how economical systems works? If you dont you will find it soon
@_date: 2017-03-05 13:08:11
 and then why you not signal segwit? You have told us in a long post that you are a legit miner but you dont give us an explanation why you block innovation... :P
@_date: 2016-03-09 15:51:59
There was a twitter post about a week ago for the reason that humble disable the bitcoin payment. And was an  error to this payment system
guess who is behind this problem... The Guy that want to save Bitcoin.. Brian Armstrong and his ridiculous company Coinbase.
If you want to buy games with bitcoin there are much better options like G2A. They work with bitpay that is much better that Coinbitch.
@_date: 2017-03-31 22:32:15
is roger ver your boss and you defend him with so much passion?
@_date: 2017-03-23 00:20:04
If they really do this then it seem they are very desperate.
this actions is always signal of losers. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:04:00
this a pure dictatorship in bitcoin. A single person block innovation to bitcoin. I think we must activate UASF asap to bypass him. He can  always create his own JihanCoin or VerCoin if he likes.
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:55:14
i also wish they fork from bitcoin asap.
No one need them and no one really care what they will do.
@_date: 2016-03-10 18:25:41
or what about Gemini. they are true bitcoin believers.
@_date: 2016-03-27 00:37:06
anyone knew the lyrics?
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:05:53
Yes i am anarchist but more ancap and no so leftist. And for sure i am more anarchist than the fake Roger Ver anarchist.   
@_date: 2017-03-23 00:17:20
Roger Ver is a pure nazist fascist and his actions prove this.
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:06:49
Bitcoin has nothing to do with democracy. Bitcoin is from tha anarchist cypherpunk movements.
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:06:25
400$ in 5 days. lol :D
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:58:29
nothing odd. only this pool existence is very odd for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-26 01:51:25
Stop using Coinbase. There are much better option in bitcoin ecosystem
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:16:29
they do much better than Bitcoin Judas that work 24/7 to divide bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-06 01:37:53
bitcoin fees calculated in kb not in $ !!!
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:57:17
now we all can see and who is really run BU from miners.  
I think most of them joke with us with this.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:34:47
no one really knows :P
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:29:10
they do the same last year for DAO :P
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:55:42
whi is this? 
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:31:29

is sad that with this consensus drama and the community split many developers can develop their work and all of this because of this drama.
I think is very easy bitcoin community to get consensus.
We can all agree to a two step consensus for a segwit activation at once and a hard fork scale after some months and only if 99% of miners support it and above 80% nodes upgrade.
In a proposal like this everyone will agree for sure, developers can continue to work and develop their ideas, drama will be top and bitcoin community will be united again,.

I have a question to him. How he say that is Bitcoin developer when he didn't develop anything usefull for bitcoin over a year now
@_date: 2016-03-27 20:28:02
Is greek sureal way to take a video from a conversation :P The event was great and Antonopoulos. The most great point was when Antonopoulos compare Euclid with Satoshi. He say that we dont know who was Euclid and if he was a real person or a philosophical movement but we use their geometry to go to Mars. The same maybe will happen to Satoshi in financial world system.

What say the President of Bitcoin Unlimited Federation about this problem? Or his ministry of propaganda? Has done any public announcement  until now?
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:21:35
Antpool has about 40-50% hahsrate. And antpool is and BTC.TOP and  ViaBTC ofcourse.
@_date: 2017-03-31 22:29:01
i am very sure now that Roger Ver is "THAT stupid" :D
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:30:28
and for sure Jihan  graduate create a bad reputation for the quality of that University :D
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:23:46
do we have any comment on this from The President of BUCoin?
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:25:21
a great example why bitcoin has a limit block size

Is real that japan will be the first country that will regulate bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:15:00
because his interest is obviously to destroy and split bitcoin community. I dont know who pay him to do this dmg to bitcoin.

this was and before not only today. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 13:38:26
bitcoin cash is an altcoin like bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond, bitcoin god etc.  
Bitcoin is Bitcoin and core is the main code that Bitcoin uses.  
Unfortunately Bitcoin com promote this altcoin and confuse new users.  
There are plenty of great wallets that you can use and ofcourse bitcoin com is not one of them. Better to choose from this list  
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:02:10
The situation here is that in bitcoin ecosystem we have several parts with different profit model.  
Miners profit is from fees and high Bitcoin price.  
Exchanges profit came from volatility and many trade orders.  
Bitcoin startups like Blockstream their profit came from develop network solutions like Lighting network.  
How can all of this parts come together and have the same economical plan. They must have all of them a win-win consensus.

No one will miss them :P

How many ppl they have lost their money to this scam? Coindesk is very responsible about that and must return back the money that anyone lost there.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:25:21
the old Jeff it seems kidnapped by aliens. i can give a better explanation for this 180 U turn from him
@_date: 2019-03-25 00:46:32
who says that?
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:22:35
are any BU devs outhere. Because Ver is not for sure a dev.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:33:27
in the other hand it seems miners to want to protect their fee market.  
They see that startups and exchanges will create a new market based in Lighting network that will get away their launch.  
The point is that there is a plenty of time to negotiation and to be a consensus.  
Bitcoin can develop to a win-win network for all the parts. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:46:55
His propaganda looks day by day more ridiculous. Who really take serious this guy?
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:25:35
yeah i agree with that. We must all focus how can we activate segwit without miners. 
But...  
In the other hand is very very very very funny to troll this clones :D like roger ver :D or the other joker Jihan :D
@_date: 2016-01-27 15:51:16
i have answer to one of them :P

@_date: 2016-01-12 15:22:31
this guy is stupid. I dont know how he get and so many bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-27 15:43:16
yes. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 00:00:07
i really like to know how as a miner will relay your blocks without a supporting node after UASF
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:09:14
for that reason  i talk about 80 or more nodes to support it
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:37:11
he is already Bitcoin Judas for the majority of bitcoin community
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:58:04
and who says that segwit will be the minority?
because until know the only minority i see is BU.
The most of the mining hashpower is with core.
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:16:51
we need UASF now and get off this scammers. 
Miners are to serve the network not to rule
@_date: 2019-03-25 18:59:30

this guy is not tired to be wrong? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:57:31
yes this can be done for sure if...
the nodes that activate segwit is not the economical nodes. Because the economical nodes is the central system that work exchanges and every startup in bitcoin ecosystem. In this situation they will had a big problem to kill them
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:13:29
liberals ?? lol is like you say Roger ver is anarchist as he say for himself. Another joke :D
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:35:01
no Jihan. segwit is a real innovation
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:39:13
in the worst scenario BU supporters can gain 50-60% of mining power. 
Imo if BU mining get above 50% will be a danger alarm for everyone to begin an open discussion what we must do next and how we can defend his miners attack to original chain.  
Behind roger ver's mask of bitcoin jesus hide the real person of a payed shadow puppet to destroy bitcoin. A new bitcoin judas.

@_date: 2019-11-26 01:10:57
yeah i know. I talk about the silly stupid games that start to play Ver and Jihan against Bitcoin in 2017.
The most harmful game that they have done back then was the campaign against segwit upgrade and ofcourse the network spamming with thousand of satoshis transactions with the only propose to push their hard fork agenda.
In the end they only harm their investments (bitpay etc), their reputation and their business economical survival (see the Bitmain economical problems.)
Bitcoin is still here, produce blocks every 10 min , create economical profits for miners and growth for individuals, hackers and devs.
Roger Ver, Bitmain, Bitpay i am not very sure that will be here after 1-2 or 5 years.

this is not correct. I just do an order and accept zero confirmation.
Bitpay general accept zero confirmations if you have the proper fees and this matter has nothing to do with steam.
In the other hand Coinbase always require one confirmation for the orders.

i would prefer to keep my money to service like bitgo than to Coinbase. this is my personal opinion and dont get it as an advice. I have many bitcoin in coinbase vault before three months but i have withdraw from there after the everyday fud against bitcoin from them.
In my case i use many places to store my bitcoin but the most of them are in cold wallets or in hardware wallets.

@_date: 2019-11-26 01:56:39
Ιmo the reason that this "news" form 2017 is in the top of r/bitcoin show two things.
1. that bitcoin as a payment retail system is not dead and ppl like in 2017 are ready to purchase goods from  every new merchant or big tech company that starts to accept bitcoin
2. Payment systems and bitcoin payment providers must do the next innovation step asap and start to built sidesystem payment systems like lightning network. Bitcoin has moved very fast in tech terms from 2017 and payment providers like bitpay if they are willing to survive they must start to follow bitcoin innovation.

because antpool always want to sabotage the network. 
Is clear that they only want to destroy bitcoin and pump their bcash shitcoin.  
Is time for a real action against Bitmain guys!
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:42:35
as a BU developer say this what it is and the vote system has not only to do with the code but and with general decision. In the other hand was not very clear how you became such a member and how you can propose things to the members.  
If you like a shadow way like this to bitcoin as i say simple create your own altcoin. You ask me all the time the same things and you have not answer a simple question that i ask from the beginning.   
Why you need to radical transform bitcoin and not create a new altcoin? because Bitcoin WORKS as it is almost 9 years now without a single problem.
@_date: 2018-10-29 20:12:13
we already know that Jihan is an idiot. Let him sink with his 1 million btrash shitcoin.

for that reason your private keys your bitcoins.
use bitsquare. It will never get down
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:33:45
i cant understand why this guys dont create a new altcoin.
They want a democratically governance of bitcoin. Bitcoin instead is a consensus system.  
They want to rise the 21 million cap and bitcoin to become a hyperinflation system. Bitcoin is not based in hyperinflation and is an ancap economical system.  
They want to give a huge power to miners to decide whatever they want the block size. Bitcoin is based in game theory balance of all the parts of the ecosystem.

One more time kudos to bitcoin devs for their great work!
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:31:25
i say again...
They have all agree that will ONLY fork the network after segwit activation.  
Viabtc break this agreement 
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:39:44
is a misstyping  for the "o"
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:21:05
lol this lazies have not even add segwit until now. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:00:51
but the diagrams say the opposite for what you say. this backlog seems to develop almost instantly and 2 days away from difficult correction. is not what or you believe but a common sense 
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:15:59
why you say this? i cant see something abnormal to bitcoin hashrate and trasnactions. Blocks keep at 10min and even the hashrate was not drop dramatically to support what you say  
  
  
we will have and anther +15% in bitcoin mining 
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:17:14
wiht such a hug unconfirmed transactions and not with a big drop to bitcoin hashrate? this not support what you say
@_date: 2017-01-28 22:28:37
you can choose to fork bitcoin now and use your Vercoin or BUcoin or whatever want name to give it.  
and Satoshi has speak before one year and he say this as i remember....  
  
I have been following the recent block size debates through the mailing list.  I had hoped the debate would resolve and that a fork proposal would achieve widespread consensus.  However with the formal release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A, this looks unlikely to happen, and so I am forced to share my concerns about this very dangerous fork.  
  
The developers of this pretender-Bitcoin claim to be following my original vision, but nothing could be further from the truth.  When I designed Bitcoin, I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the   consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement.  Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto.    Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it.  By doing a fork in this way, these developers are violating the "original vision" they claim to honour.  
  
They  use my old writings to make claims about what Bitcoin was supposed to be.  However I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time, and new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early   opinions.  For example I didn't anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network.  Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and   we should take more time to come up with a robust solution.  I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.  
  
If two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed   project.  Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust.  This present situation has been very disappointing to watch unfold.

he say this in Bitcoin-core slack and everyone can understand the meaning of what he say. I am sorry that you cant understand this but you are in the wrong side atm. Anyone that want to change such core mechanism in bitcoin is against bitcoin.  
My question is simple. why all of you dont simple create a new altcoin?

you cant. You only need to keep your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:27:11
is a qustion to me why they want to kill the goose with the gold eggs? And i talk about miners and startup ceo and owners.  
One explanation can be that Jihan's mining cartel want to destroy bitcoin so he can switch to bcash that is more controllable from him and centralised. But and this explanation has many flaws because a bitcoin collapse will damage every crypto token and the market will do many years to recover imo.  
The other explanation is that this guy are payed puppets and the do a job to destroy the system.   And this explanation one more time has many flaws and cant stand in logic.  
The last explanation that i can give is that all of them Miners, Ceo's, many devs are simple fools and they live in their own reality that has nothing to do with the real world.  
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:41:49
because they are idiots. 2017 will be the year that everyone accept that there is no blocckhain without tokens
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:07:19
Yeah the network when it decide what transaction will get first to the next block. This is the meaning of double spent
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:50:14

@_date: 2017-01-23 18:05:42
yeah in the consensus bitcoin governance system this is very difficult to happen.  
in the democratically governacne propose of BU with a member vote system and miners that rule not server the network this is very easy to happen.

just say this one of BU developer. Can you read or no?
@_date: 2017-01-25 01:09:42
but the blocks here not show something abnormal even when this difficult correction happen the block still was in normal times  
@_date: 2017-01-28 16:16:21
and kubuntu 16.10 ti has
@_date: 2016-06-08 22:42:05
i use tor and i dont care what this jerks will do 
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:32:55
because you talk about this membership vote? Bitcoin has nothing to do with "democracy" and never will has.  
get use it or leave bitcoin and create your own altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:52:49
it seems that they dont even care about the stability of a project like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:25:34
this hashrate has nothting to do with who is more profitable. This mining cartel only want to destroy bitcoin and nothing more.
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:29:31
it seems this is the new crypto world meme :D
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:26:08
one more time again and maybe you can understand this...  
to tell me something is not an evidence. Your theory ha no any clues and for that reason is totally crap imo
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:52:34
lol what a crap
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:59:36
yeah tell them to gtf. Your bitcoin is yours and you can do whatever you like without apologise to anyone. If they think they are some kind of bitcoin bank then show them your middle finger.. :D
@_date: 2018-10-19 00:45:33
I will never use them because they are shitcoiners and support bcash crap fork
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:54:59
and why is this a problem? They have decide to give money from the fees to the other miners. The game theory economy will work again here and correct this situation.
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:41:36
someone attack the network to bring it to heavy load
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:26:59
is this  
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:05:01
i can stand a bitcoin at 1000$ if bcash goes to 10$, just to see the ridiculous face reaction of Ver :P
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:41:10
Imo the time has come for the bitcoin community and developer to think about a pow change.  
It seems Satoshi was very idealistic to think that miners will act always honest and with the only propose to protect their profits or he had not predict the asics centralisation. 
As we see today miners start to switch massive hashpower to bcash. They have keep this even now when mining is 120% less profitable there.  
The only interest of this mining cartel is to damage bitcoin.  
I think is time for everyone to think about a powe change. Is the only change bitcoin to survive in long terms under this situation.
@_date: 2017-01-14 15:56:52
who cares?
@_date: 2017-01-13 00:50:38
they have drop a revolutionary payment system to be a paypal company... lol  
We already have paypal dudes :P
@_date: 2017-01-25 01:16:11
one other point is that the difficult correction happen at 22 January and this spike to unconfirmed transactions happen at 24 January. How this two different event with 2 days away each other can create such a spike in 5 hours?
@_date: 2017-01-29 15:31:35
you mean blockchain.info wallet?
then ask them about it.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:18:21
i have create a vote here for the name of new token  
 please vote :D

@_date: 2018-10-25 11:18:10
and the same time Bitpay almost collapse and transform to a crap startup that no one want to use.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:50:47
after  one hour block there was three block in a range of minutes.
@_date: 2019-11-15 02:14:02
i also believe that this is very shadow and i am very suspicious to be fake or worst a high level scam attempt. Everyone must remember that pineapple fund had the proof of their bitcoin and a signed message in their front page.
@_date: 2017-01-14 20:37:19
everyone is ready. nodes, exchanges, startups. the only that is not are the miners :(

but nothing prove what you say. I dont care what you say., Can you prove it?  
and can you tell me why this spike happen 2 days after the difficult correction?  
why this spike suddenly appear from "thin air" without a block time increase?  
  
  
  
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:56:29

it can be so huge increase in so less time. This is very suspicious

i think is very early to anyone "celebrate". It seems that their volume seems to slowly recover and imo we all need to wait 1-2 days to see what will be 
@_date: 2018-10-20 23:54:46
Massive adoption??
Who promise to you this?
I thought the main reason bitcoin existence is the unbanking money that no one can control and for sure Bitcoin is this.
The recent history of miners attack, miners private fork and buying support the new coin, huge business segwit2x failure, failure of code hijack, all of them prove that bitcoin is money that no one can control
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:08:36
they have agree to fork the network only after segwit activation.  
Viabtc break this agreement and fork the network now
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:27:24
in 5-10 years there will be no circle at all imo
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:10:26
lol another fork :D  
what will be the name of this new token?  
I vote for bcoin
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:24:48
have you notice that shitcoin chain is dead from txs? 
@_date: 2016-06-26 23:02:34
smart contracts maybe will work better in sidechains or with private databases that works with a blockchain system. General i really cant see what problem they solve. We see the DAO example what is the most weak point in smart contract through blockchain systems. And we can see what solution propose to solve this problem. Simple a middleman.
@_date: 2017-01-19 17:48:03
it seems his ethereum bet was an epic fail movement 
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:04:48
I am afraid a very possible scenario that bitcoin will end up without any skilled devs or with crap devs like Gavin, Garzik and Bu kids.  
We all have seen the quality of their work.  
The scenario is that everyone miners, startups, exchanges etc agree to fork the chain and follow the new chain.  
Imo the minority chain will very diff to survive and after that for sure the most of bitcoin devs will give up or quit their work.  
Bitcoin will remain to the hands of shadow ppl  like Jihan, Ver and every charlatan outhere that fight and fud bitcoin two years now.  
A remind is that this guys want a bitcoin without 21 million coins, they dont care about the stability of the network, they dont care about the quality and testing code they dont even care about a good plan of bitcoin future.  
Anyone can imagine what will be the "new" bitcoin after that fork.  
A piece of crap.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:25:41
yes you can. In ledgerwallet i already do this several times
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:23:01
but is a pleasure to trash kind of ppl  like Wrightamoto or Ver
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:47:51
and how everyone upgrade to something that not exists?
@_date: 2016-11-15 23:11:59
yeah you are right  
i will remove it from the list  
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:25:56
one good think that came from this bitcoin drama was that uncovers many charlatans and bad actors around bitcoin.
Roger Ver imo is one of them but his illusions are pure personal mental problems.  
this guy needs a doctor asap.

@_date: 2016-11-30 20:11:58
yeah you are right. Just before some hours they have another 2 kb block. Is seems that they create very often that kind of blocks
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:05:03
the only valuable thing that you can buy with ethereum is bitcoin. the smart contract ethereum system is completely broken and unusable

We are going to china era.
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:35:14
nice strategy from exchanges to blcok  deposit so they can first sell this Viashitcoin to fools. I believe strongly that exchanges are behind this shit fork.
@_date: 2017-01-23 16:56:35
yeah i know and this is Bitcoin Unlimited. as i say this code breaks every rule of bitcoin governance that we have eight years now.  
if anyone of you want a democratically governance for bitcoin and to vote for everything even for coin limit then bitcoin is not a system that fit to your needings and you must create a new altcoin.  
Can you understand this or is difficult for you?
@_date: 2017-01-20 18:31:42
who cares?
@_date: 2016-12-19 00:50:45
because coinbase is against everyone in bitcoin ecosystem
@_date: 2017-01-27 00:41:26
with Trump as president this will never happen
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:40:40
why segwit2x big blocker think that their chain will have the most value after the fork. And the surprise is that they are very sure about it. There is more possible that legacy bitcoin chain to keep it value especially because the chain will unusable and no one can transfer bitcoins to exchanges. 
What will happen if the value of legacey coin is much more profitable than segwit2x and keep it value. How long miners will mine this chain and not switch to bcash or back to bitcoin.  
And another big question is who will use this new chain?  
Becuase bcash seems to used by ppl that want to clean their "dirty" bitcoins. Who will use a chain that controlled by Jihan and with not skilled reputation developers.  
Imo the free market will choose the chain with more tech future behind it. and tech future can create only Bitcoin devs not this crap charlatans like Gavin,Garzik, Wright, Ver, Jihan and Wrightamoto.
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:51:42
and some ppl even well known community members predict before months the collapse of bitcoin mining.....
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:11:56
miners must create ONLY empty blocks so there will be more easy everyone to leave bitcoin and use a more centralised system like all of this scammers Jihan, Wright, Ver propose.
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:02:03
i dont think so. Smart contracts in blockchain systems has no future. Maybe a more complex mix system will has but not a pure blockchain smart contract system.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:08:17
because they want big blocks but segwit double the block size and fix a long time bug of bitcoin...  
You not understand it??? Me too :D  
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:36:02
The answer is obvious. Wright is a hoaxer that try with lies and fake evidence to take over Satoshi's id.  
Roger Ver is the person that spread his madness as toxicity to the bitcoin community. He is the main responsible for the split of btc community and he act against bitcoin. He is an enemy of it.
@_date: 2016-11-23 01:33:48
great idea!
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:18:26
everyone seems to want segwit and wait for it expect from miners :P
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:17:13

miners that block segwit they really dont know what they want.  
It seems that they want segwit but and a hard fork  
they want bitcoin core dev team but and BU  
they are so confused that it seems litecoin will be the first that will adopt this great tech solution of segwit that will open an innovation in the system
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:24:56
bitcoin.com is a gambling site and is a shame for Roger Ver to use this domain like that.

@_date: 2016-11-07 12:29:34

As it is right now it looks like a "bitcoin mining farm" dlc for sim city
@_date: 2016-11-23 01:37:05
this is and the main reason that Satoshi "left" bitcoin.   
Bitcoin problems can solved with consensus and there is no needing of a leader to show the way.

ok whatever... i lost my time with you...
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:46:02
it seems bcash become every day a great tool for Jihan's mining cartel to pump his propaganda and agenda fro big blocks.  
With bcash switch mining they can keep forever the fee and mempool in bitcoin very high.

it shows that genesis block can be mined at 2008 only with quantum computer. Even the most strong cpu or supercomputer will have done 300 and more years to mine this block.

Vote in twitter for the name of the new segwit2x fork token.  
The options are:

you are very wrong with this. is not companies that do bitcoin what it is but the opposite. For i dont care if can understand this. Is your money, your company and you can do whatever you think is better for you. Good luck with this.. :P  
Only to say that is a reason why bitcoin Uncofirmed txs are up to 100.000 and that bcash only has 1% of bitcoin txs :D

the good point is that every vps provider that i use for years have already drop bitpay and now thery are using other providers.  
bitpay act like Bitcoin ecosystem and crypto world are to 2013 or 2014. There are plenty of other payment providers out there more flexible, more customer friendly and of course without a hiding political agenda to pump a specific shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-05 11:49:08

@_date: 2018-06-23 23:37:27
full agree. Bitpay has lost their reputation forever. Let them collapse with their beloved bcash shitcoins.  
No one need them anymore in this new bitcoin and crypto era.

r/btc is not bitcoin but bcash and is not r/btc but r/bch heh
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:35:58
bitcoin for sure will goes to a stagnation situation in tech terms and this will be very dangerous.

with cpu miner to create at that time a block like this you will need hundred of years
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:57:30
bcash is one of dozens of Bitcoin forks, a trend in 2017. All of them has failed.
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:41:40
no one 
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:54:08
what kind of trouble? Is only fan to troll Roger Ver especially when after his rekt shitcoin collapse :D
@_date: 2016-11-27 18:40:07
what kind of centralisation you talk about?
@_date: 2019-08-31 10:56:49
you just scammed from Roger Ver
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:15:49
i have just buy a game through lightning. Works great and very good prices
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:34:23
imo Roger Ver in 2020 will step down from Bitcoin com and will sell it to a third party
@_date: 2016-11-07 16:32:02
then maybe he need bitwala
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:43:49
crap it says about Ver. Back then no one know that this guy will transform to a real enemy of bitcoin and that he want to destroy the system with forks, propaganda, price manipulation etc. Roger Ver was always a psychopath criminal and is the main reason for his actions.

i just want to remind you that is the same devs and only 10% of all core developers of bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-06-06 11:14:54
they dont accept payments with replace by fee and refuse to get it even if it has confirmation. They refund you but after 2 months. That what happen in my case.
@_date: 2016-11-30 20:11:08
the point is that Antpool creates that kind of block very often
@_date: 2019-08-17 23:18:53
Bitcoin like internet will never care who will use it. Is a tool of freedom and everyone are free to use it.
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:15:38
because we born and we learn that if you want to transfer value you must always trust a third party and banks.
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:11:14
this is another lie from this jerk fraudster. If you do a search his name or his company has not even register a dozen of them. He is lying. He is a liar 
@_date: 2016-12-07 14:35:49
I cant see why this guys need a blockchain system to fit for their business. 
I think sooner or later will completely drop blockchain layers and works with a central control dataserver like paypal or Alibaba do it.  
In other hand is very pathetic to blame bitcoin developers for their failure when they not have invest a single bitcoin to develop something for bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:43:15
what a crap. And some lunatic pump this crap like the holy grail of blockchain systems lol..  
if anyone want bitcoin to transform to an every day drama like ethereum this is the way to go...

@_date: 2018-06-08 22:21:40
Mike Hear like Gavin Andressen or Garzik was the most ridiculous devs around bitcoin.   
Bitcoin is much much more healthy without them.   
This guys was not only toxic but dangerous to the stability of the system.
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:45:17
  
There is Bitcoin and almost 100 shitcoin forks, bcash is one of them.

@_date: 2018-06-08 01:36:23
Never has a logic to pay with a system with bunch of scammers around it, ccntroled from a single company Bitmain and without devs.  
I prefer to pay fees to Bitcoin or at least to use Litecoin, Monero even dogecoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:44:57
pure sybil attack attemp 
@_date: 2018-06-07 00:04:26
yeah it seems it will refund at 300 blocks now. For sure it must be something with the failed routing to your node. I was connected to eclair node and open a channel there. Is a common problem they failed routing. The good is that now the payments always refund and is very rare someone to lost money with lightning but it still in very early stage.
@_date: 2019-10-25 23:51:34

@_date: 2019-02-20 01:22:56
this is the end of the illusion that Bitcoin will replaced by something else.
We have already seen what happen to Bitmain.
Is ridiculous to this early adopters of Bitcoin to step back and leave space to their competitors.
The future of payments is only to Bitcoin blockchain system with sidechains, second layer payments like lightning network and on chain will segwit, schnorr 
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:56:11
This "feature" to receive messages from the servers is ridiculous, very dangerous and is a question why Electrum devs have not remove it until now.

i own only bitcoin and dont sell anything even to 20k
I have sell only bccash and every fork  coin
We have a situtatuion that a dev want to fork bitcoin and make an backward incompatible version  of it with 300kb blocks.
I dont care who is this guy. The point is that someone want to make his own rules to Bitcoin without any consensus.
With the same logic conclusion of you we have make gains from Gavin Andressen and MIke Hearn

segwit2x nodes is a malicious attack to bitcoin network
@_date: 2019-02-02 01:47:54
this story is very fishy,.
I dont believe that only one person have access to the wallet and will not be surprise if we see the coins to move on after some time.
Are we sure that this guy is dead?
@_date: 2019-02-20 15:58:54
the only good thing about bcash is that ppl like Roger Ver have leave bitcoin maybe forever.
This kind of ppl are toxic, scammers (mtgox, dash etc example), they spread tech crap claims (everyone can spent segwit) and they promote and support every scammer around bitcoin ( craig wright)

Finally i had an answer from amazon that they understand that this app is a scam and they say they will resolve this at once. 
They give me and 5 euro for my next purchase.
i give them an answer to understand the problem 
Is not a big issue for me because i lost only 0.001bitcoin(0.03euro).
The big problem is the quality control for the mobile app to your store.
This guys give a bitcoin community site as their company site and a
bitcoin developer email as their email and with that fake details they
have upload a scam app to your store.
This is a big problem and i hope to resolve it asap.
I am a many year customer and i trust amazon for my order and for my money.
I think your company can handle this to not happen again.
and finally they sent me an email and they say that they have underastand that this app was a scam and will resolve this matter asap. Smiley
I told them this
I understand the app "Bitcoin Wallet" is a scam and it stole your BTC from blockchain.
Thanks for binging this to our attention, I've reported this issue to our technical team to look in to this matter further. We definitely value your opinion and suggestions and will continue to listen and respond to our customers' concerns.We will make every effort to evaluate the information you have provided, and try our level best to lead it to program changes or enhancements.
they have give me and 5 euros for the next order Tongue
so for all of this something good has happen and i dont say about the 5 euro credits but about the remove of bitcoin scam app from their store
and they answer me this

This guy seems to know nothing about cryptocurrencies and how it works. I follow the tech history from the begining of 80 and i see this many times.

why only Bitcoin cores and not Bitcoin Knots? :P
I predict that  very soon Roger Ver will sell bitcoin com. He cant ignore forever the very big offers for his domain.
Roger Ver was always a greedy person and he never care about bitcoin and what represents. 
He cant continue to run this crap site with a huge everyday $ lose.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:41:28
The real disadvantage is that if this fork success then we will have a leader in bitcoin core system that will rule the system. And we see that in history when you have a leader to rule a system this system will fail asap.

imo bitcoin can by design stand against every idiot CEO out there.   
Coinbase, XApo, Bitpay, Blockchain.info they have two choices. They are begin to corporate with bitcoin developers or they will be out of bitcoin ecosystem.  
Their choice...
@_date: 2019-02-20 17:29:56
is not only greed but and a pure stupidity.
Take a look at Bitmain. This mining company dominate bitcoin mining space and had great profits every year.
Suddenly they decide that Bitcoin is not good and they start to pump a forked shitcoin :P We already know what happen next.
Or another great example is and [blockchain.info]( The majority of their customer are bitcoin users maybe 99.99% of them and all of their profits came from there  but suddenly they decide that Bitcoin is not good and is a great idea toy support a shitcoin that no one use :P
This is an Epic Fail situation for all of them.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:59:01
imo this is not a problem at all. Le this fool to loose his money. To an outsider he sound like a scammer that try hard to promote a shitcoin or a scamcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:26:10
dont forget everyone to run this script to ban the segwit2x nodes
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:03:44
i dont think so. In my opinion this is one way option. If we give such a power to only one person then there will be no point to return back. The old system will destroy, the other developers will leave and only the Gavin team will stay to rule all the bitcoin ecosystem
@_date: 2019-04-16 01:18:31
Yeah. I like to add here and the case of Kevin Pham.
This guy do about 30k tweets per day to support Craig Wright scammer.
Is the same guy that back to 2017 says this... :P
Another trick from Craig Wright and Roger Ver is to pride or buy popular bitcoin accounts to promote their shitcoin scams.
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:35:16
Gavin was the first and Matonis.
Then follows Roger Ver
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:58:54
you can calculate this number if you add Antpool, Btc.com with Viabtc and BTC.TOP. the last two miner has economical relationships with Bitmain. Bitmain is their biggest investor to this mining pools. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:00:45
is not all of the core. I think only 5 or 6 work for blockstream. Bitcoin developers are more than 50
@_date: 2019-04-14 00:20:15
did Gavin Andresen approve this?
@_date: 2017-04-22 11:10:30
the point that no one must take serious this guys.

why you dont bet with bitcoins? What is that fucking $?
@_date: 2016-02-26 19:26:44
We are hoping for that. Everyone need cheap bitcoins especially before bitcoin halving. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:45:39
It seems Roger Ver is very close to political ideas from communism even fascism than anarchism or ancap that he claim to be.
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:22:27
i will never give a click to Roger Ver's blog 
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:54:48
This guy is completely fool and i cant understand how he get so many bitcoin with such a poor mind
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:05:06
yeah an upward stall :P
@_date: 2017-04-07 21:30:03
i can tell your for sure that with his money he can only buy my shits. 
nothing more.
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:24:15
no miners is not BItcoin. Bitcoin is the whole ecosystem, users, startups, exchanges, developers, nodes..
@_date: 2017-04-15 00:55:44
yeah i agree with that and i agree with Greg about UASF but it seems the only  tactic from bitcoin devs atm is "wait until Jihan die" as you say.  
@_date: 2017-04-05 11:30:04
Bitcoin works just fine as it is. Anyone that says that bitcoin has a problem atm simple spread fud. For that reason no one really cares because of failure activation of segwit, failure hard for of BU or whatever.  
I am very sure that most ppl that use bitcoin every day never heard and this words or not care. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 00:25:02
i think Roger Ver is never ending laughing :D
@_date: 2019-04-12 00:24:18
This shows one more time the corrupt of "democracy" system.  
Assange and Manning are true heroes of our era.
@_date: 2017-04-28 01:01:49
i am almost in the same camp. I agree that bitcoin will need in the future a big block but i agree to avoid as possible this because if very difficult situation a hard fork. 
But i will always support the most skilled and tech guys in this ecosystem. And for sure that guys are bitcoin core devs.
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:32:09
the only breakdown to price was Jihan ridiculous claim that he will fork the network. In that moment that he say this bitcoin  crash near to 800$
@_date: 2016-02-28 22:02:10
And who is this guy? And why everyone care about his opinion?
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:24:18
that is the vision from miners for the future of Bitcoin plus a BU president 
@_date: 2019-04-07 11:30:20
bcash propaganda and ridiculous claims of "many bitcoins".
@_date: 2016-02-11 00:19:30
probably we will go to this asap

great answer from Antonopoulos. Lobbying with miners is not how a decentralised system must works.
@_date: 2016-02-06 02:27:43
I am sure is the part of the "diabolical plan" some ppl to get easy money to their pockets.. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 00:19:25
great video! it seems ethereum is completely wrong for how a smart contract can proper run through a blockchain system

@_date: 2016-02-25 19:54:48
for some point and after there will be no bicoin mining without fees. And  fee is the only solution to spam attack and spam attack is the main reason that Satoshi put that mb limit to blocks. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 18:16:08
this  if Brian Armstrong is still the CEO of Coinbase by 22nd February 2018. If Coinbase change name until then i win, if he step down from CEO but he is still in Coinbase i win and if Coinbase bankrupt until then i win. If CEO is still in his position with the company as Coinbase you win
@_date: 2017-04-19 01:25:41
yes i believe this too but it seems that presentation is very poor. situation after a UASF fork or even a hard fork from miners will be much more chaotic than this presentation.
@_date: 2016-02-27 15:37:03
it doesn't seem to do this. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 22:25:56
this guy also say last year that he sold all of his Bitcoin for DAO :D
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:05:40
this is an old style mafia. Mafia control bitcoin atm
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:31:00
I agree with that scenario is the most possible. 
You have not write the "bank" run from cloud wallets, exchanges in this grey period.
I also believe that this situation will be the bitcoin collapse forever that it can't be recover anymore.
No one will trust their money in such unstable system anymore and especially in a system that any small group can create chaos like this.
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:55:05
what arch linux image has to do with this?
@_date: 2019-04-07 11:32:41
the most closed coin to bitcoin and that can work as everyday coffee payment system is Dogecoin and for sure not a BcashABC or SV
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:49:52
Is all of that sponsors real? Can wired, bbc, microsoft, cisco, samsung, ethereum prove that they are sponsors? 
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:17:59
lol and you think bcashABC has any dev? only one guy that copy paste code from bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:26:24
are this guys really believe with such ridiculous ppl around bcash that anyone will follow their bullshits?
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:28:59
I have been waiting this release! i like segwit patch especially to release disk space from hard disk in my nodes and to my pc.
@_date: 2016-02-25 18:00:17
Great is time for everyone to keep together. No one is enemy here and everyone need bitcoin to succeed.
@_date: 2017-04-14 00:01:47
miners is the real problem in bitcoin atm.
@_date: 2016-02-26 19:02:51
Is much better than to have your coins in a bitcoin bank. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 01:03:07
or you can go back and use Banking system.
It has thousands of corruption stories like Bitmain's .  
@_date: 2017-04-04 22:46:37
and why centralised mining?
@_date: 2017-04-19 00:50:38
i believe the price will be much more chaotic than in this presentation and will last much more days. 
We forget that miners and some of miners supporters are and big holders. 
For sure in the first 24 hours of that split they will want to create a price sell panic to the segwit chain and that they will sell a part of their stake. 
This will press the segwit token price this pressure will last maybe for many days.  
The other gray area about this fork if this happen is the replay attack. What will protect the segwit chain from this?  
I believe if this fork happen will be a chaotic situation in bitcoin and that will resolve after a month and that bitcoin will do many years to recover from it.
UASF is somehow safe only if supported from 50-60% current mining hashrate.
@_date: 2017-04-05 11:31:12
There is no issue with bitcoin and it works just fine. Developers try to activate segwit but they failed. Is not the end of the world. Everyone must accept this situation and to move on.
@_date: 2017-04-15 12:54:22
for sure Jihan has finally turn against him the whole crypto world :D  
gz! hahahaha
@_date: 2016-02-22 16:43:09
there are many other things that anyone want to cloes his account to Coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 22:44:01
To respect what? an idiot that he find some opportunity to bump his coin Ethereum? come on... I simple dont care what the price he want to trade his coins.
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:42:17
yeah i agree with that. and it seems many of miners like Antpool is against bitcoin and community. The only answer to this is the free market . Boycottage to Antpool services and products.
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:40:33
maybe they have a hidden agenda. There is no other logical explanation for someone to block his wealth grow.
@_date: 2017-04-23 00:13:00
what happen with the proposal from bitcoin developers to deactivate Asicboost?
because i have not hear anything.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:37:20
yes 
@_date: 2017-04-24 16:05:08
because is a ready for production code...... :P
@_date: 2016-02-13 00:02:21
this is the most logic step that can do

hahahahahaha :D
@_date: 2017-04-17 23:34:29
As Roger Ver says users not need to run nodes. Apparently Bitcoin as Roger Ver says need only 1 Big node :D
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:26:13
and from whom prefer to be funding from a single chnese miner like BU?  
Because bitcoin developers is above 100 ppl and are funding from many different sources.
@_date: 2016-02-16 17:06:03
with the next release and seg wit patch we will not need all of this data in the wallet forlder. If i am not mistake the bitcoin core will use 1-2 only gb. We have only one month until then.
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:12:00
@_date: 2017-04-23 01:16:44
it seems you need only 6 months to start to fire developers from bitcoin :D
@_date: 2017-04-07 21:25:30
what smoke this guys? i like to have some :D
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:41:30
why anyone care what this guy think about?
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:30:16
it will after a while. it needs time
@_date: 2017-04-24 00:35:09
i will never click to a site that controlled by Roger Ver
@_date: 2017-04-30 00:42:59
Guo in the end always get it.
@_date: 2016-02-29 12:24:52
yes and keep them to a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2016-02-22 17:28:24
their reaction is very strange even in politcal terms. Maybe they are hiding something else? Maybe economical problems or something similar?
@_date: 2016-02-06 00:44:16
It is obvious that Gavin and his team speculate Bitcoin price one month now. Is not so easy to accept that only has a tech interest about the block size. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 01:23:48
this is a pic from dragon's den?

he is a usefull idiot like he was with MTgox
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:19:21
Gz! i have several nodes too. With a node you help the bitcoin network :)
@_date: 2017-04-19 01:21:06
BU low values in bitfinex came and from the prediction that a Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork will never happen not only because the BU system will be a crap.

"to or from you" 
then what you need a good faith or a good trusty banker?
@_date: 2016-02-21 19:00:51
yes but we must find a temporary solution until someone propose a real solution. Dont forget that bitcoin is to be used by people. When a transaction doing hours to confirm the you have lost this target. For that we must all support the core roadmap to to calm the situation and then developers to have the time to find a real solution.

this guys are scammers and obviously play dirty trading games against bitcoin.  
Wang Chun has done exactly the same to litecoin.
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:44:01
bitcoin has value because not even an idiot holder can him or a central miner like Jihan cant hurt it.
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:18:15
Jihan. there is a single threat atm to bitcoin and everyone must unite to defeat it.
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:46:12
this is a very easy answer. ZERO! or better 0 or better 零, 	零
@_date: 2017-04-24 16:14:20
hold hold is a central platform in a web page?
is not a true p2p platform like bitsquare as i understand

this guy is a lunatic. What they smoke? i like to have some... :P
@_date: 2017-04-15 18:57:13
yeah whatever..is exactly the same meaning. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:54:03
I am one of the persons that has criticise Brain Armstrong especially in twitter. 
The most of it was that it seems that he didnt want to wokr with core developer but to make his own agenda with bitcoin. 
Is time to get this over and all the community unite and keep together imo.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:06:58
this happens because of the crap wallets they use. I am sure that Bipay's Copay wallet will have high fees atm. Bitpay has choose the ridiculous path of politcal propaganda instead to use their resources to upgrade their wallets and to add segwit. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 01:22:01
who really cares. BU was DOA from the beginning. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 16:42:20
lol! epic fail from him. He has fail if you see that reaction in political terms and they only thing that is doing now is to hurt his company reputation and to drop his last supporters.
I bet Wiht anyone who want 10 bitcoins that this guy will step down from Coinbase the next 2 years.
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:24:41
only a remind to everyone that his scam shitcoin was promote from many that will replace Bitcoin :P
@_date: 2016-02-28 23:59:07
As you say both of them now work to other project with their own agenda. You dont need to be smart to underastand wha this means. I dont have problem with altcoins but i have problem with all of them that they think destroying Bitcoin will rise their altcoin. This is very wrong and is very wrong how they see all the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 17:55:44
the bet is active from 22 February 2016 and iwll be end in 22 February 2018. Is ok to you?
@_date: 2017-04-22 23:39:07
yeah we already know that :P
@_date: 2017-04-11 00:00:29
is very difficult to find anyone if bitmain use this but the evidence is clear that they have
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:36:21
yeah i see this now :(
@_date: 2016-02-25 23:58:28
@_date: 2016-02-18 18:18:40
i mean i like to have a full node ant to transmit the full blockchain histoyr to other new nodes. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:44:21
my question is that will be ever exist a not open to anyone not decentralized and no token blockchain like hypeledger?
@_date: 2019-04-07 23:51:43
there is a small detail here...  
"this sub" is the most active subreddit in crypto world with over 1 million subscribers.
Is obvious that if someone decide to turn against the ppl of this community this will be a decision of bussiness failure.
And yes many of your dev team have done this. Pacia is a great example for what i talking.
You are not just a neutral app that you decide to support many other coins.
Many of your devs turn against bitcoin with fud and bcash propaganda.  
The result is a dead project with no future imo. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 12:02:10
the suprise here is that this guys they dont really know how bitcoin works. 
They think that not only can fork easy the network, but and that attack to the main chain will not create economical chaos and will be a weekend walk.  
They dont know that there are ppl in bitcoin that will defend it and after the fork will be a tech war and disaster in both chains.
@_date: 2016-02-11 01:36:17
i agree with that. And i like to add that all of this guys that support fork it seems that not support a tech upgrade to bitcoin but they want simple to kill bitcoin core. 
I dont know the reasosn but this is not a good action to want to kill a team that develop bitcoin all of that years.
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:47:02
Roger Ver just get back his lies. Nothing more nothing less
@_date: 2016-02-22 18:37:36
do you ever think that the most ppl in this planet dont live in a English language world?
@_date: 2016-02-29 00:05:57
and to you and sorry about that :) But i am angry for all of them who they are in rush to kill bitcoin for their own hidden agenda. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 15:54:33
I like really know who is that donwvoter in all of bitcoin articles here? :P strange... :D
@_date: 2019-04-08 12:45:59
I dont have a problem a project or an app to be neutral and to add all of the 1500 shitcoin out there.
The problem here begins when thera are group of their devs that every day promote a tripple forked shitcoin as the "real bitcoin" or when they do every day propaganda with ridiculous non tech claims (segwti everyone can spend, segwit will not rise blocksize, fee will increase forever)
@_date: 2016-02-06 00:08:29
you can enable and upnp to your settings and to your router.
@_date: 2016-02-26 20:32:57
In bitcoin world everything can happen. Many times rumours and fud spread by traders to manipulate Bitcoin price. But the point is that everyone want cheap coins and this will be much more difficult especially after the recent consensus and after bitcoin halving. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:19:19
Bitmain is hostile against bitcoin and community. They act like a mafia and nothing more.
they must wipe out asap.
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:52:34
i like to have a full node and not simple a node.
@_date: 2016-02-22 19:08:14
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:30:48
and Libsecp256k1 verification is a great patch for the first release
@_date: 2016-02-28 23:02:53
ok rolls your eyes but the point is anyone is free to go to other altcoins or to create their own. For that Satoshi open source the code.
This guy he can easy create his AnthonyCoin and release it to the market..
My opinion is that all of them that seems to care about bitcoin is all of them that bitcoin ecosystem dint really need them.
They need us as customers, they need bitcoin because has 432 more value that fiat dollar and they need bitcoin developers./
is that simple.
@_date: 2016-02-23 16:54:01
one of the best maybe the best bitcoin hardware wallets
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:39:19
I dont care about what you say. I still prefer bitcoin than any other fiat money
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:19:49
  
a new tshirt in ob :D
@_date: 2016-02-22 15:53:03
one of the best articles i ever read about bitcoin! GZ!
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:25:47
miners are the only one that get payed from the network every day, every 10 minutes.   
is a fool decision to turn not only against this payment system but against the whole ecosystem 
@_date: 2017-04-20 19:33:39
Everything says emin or predict for bitcoin are failure. He has predict in 2013 that bitcoin mining has a serious flaw and will soon collapse :P
He has predict that ethereum can easily fork and nothing will happen :P
@_date: 2017-04-04 11:53:55
the same is not happen and with lighting network? the question is simple. 
Do we like a second extension layer of bitcoin or not?
@_date: 2016-02-06 22:57:15
i think they have fix this problem or not?
@_date: 2019-04-28 23:32:37
Revival? What happen to Bitcoin to have to revive?
@_date: 2017-04-30 00:38:05
i think you must get this change to defeat this scammer in court.
@_date: 2017-04-15 15:33:27
the most strange is that this ridiculous tweet has and likes to Twitter. Who are this guys :D
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:13:07
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:31:15
you prefer a Jihan central mining mafia coin or community anonymous decentralised bitcoin like always be?
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:08:35
Can we all agree that Bitcoin is hostage atm from Chinese mining mafia?
Something we have to do. this threat must end
@_date: 2017-04-24 19:16:14
but this is very difference from a platform to run to central server web page.
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:48:18
this guy is so many times wrong. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 16:51:22
try and a hard wallet like ledgerwallet
is cheap and you have the coins. In bitcoin wolrd you dont need to keep you money to online platforms. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:29:59
"without overwhelming consensus" UASF has overwhelming consensus atm
@_date: 2016-02-06 00:10:14
i dont think that you need to create a http-server this is wrong to your setting. You must simple forward the 8333 port to your internal ip adress of your pc. Close that door that you open through this settings NOW! is very risky to your internet security
@_date: 2016-02-11 00:21:01
The blind zerg can't think so complex and they just follow the Classic, Hearn and Gavin nonsense 
@_date: 2016-09-11 00:19:16
lol :D
@_date: 2017-04-15 18:50:40
this guys is obviously not talk anymore for bitcoin but for something completely difference. Maybe for their own terms altcoin. No one know anymore and no one can follow them to this disaster.
@_date: 2017-04-09 00:10:44
and the fees to be 10000 :P
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:04:30
Chinese Miners Mafia is obviously has get him... :P
@_date: 2016-09-19 19:02:32

@_date: 2018-03-07 16:34:47
bcash has less transactions even from dogecoin.
@_date: 2016-09-01 00:36:05
this is a common logic
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:21:42
Cobra first says that bcash was an attack to bitcoin. After he says that Bcash will take over because Lithgtning network will fail.  
Cobra first propose a pow change because he want to fight the central controlled mining by chinese and jihan Wu. The same time he promote bcash that is controlled by the same miners. The same time he begin a new fight when one mining pattent was open and compete to Jihan mining.  
No one must forget that Cobra begin this change pow drama the same time that new miners get to bitcoin mining ecocystem.  
And who is Cobra? Cobra was first appear in 2013. Was completely silent all of this years. Recently before 8 months he start to be very active in social media. Even his reddit accoun start to be suddenly active. And what he says is very suspicious imo.  
This guy has a hidden agenda and for sure is not the person that can handle a historical bitcoin site as bitcoin.org anymore.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:33:35
why fud? it was a situation that happen to me
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:27:03
yeah bcash will be the payment system because is "the real bitcoin" as every bcash idiot says.  
And not litecoin with less time and more flexible.
Not dogecoin with zero fees.  
No. Only bcash.   
And somehting else that said this no compromised cobra is that if ln will fail then bitcoin will doom.  
He say that to twitter if anyone is curious.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:47:36
only bcash? lol. But i have add your node to my ln node

lol you still continue and promote this crap.   
You false promote and misleading all the disccusion to a term like LN-Failed=Bitcoin-Doomed=Bcash-IsTheNewBitcoin.  
You are the toxic person here to promote all of this bullshits.  
And why not litecoin or dogecoin. Because you wake up today and you think that litecoin is failed when even DogeCoin has more txs from bcash?  
Step down from bitcoin .org now and then you can promote and say whatever crap you want.  
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:17:19
@_date: 2018-03-10 02:07:32
nothing really. And i dont think anyone has a problem for someone to fork off from bitcoin network and create his own path.  
The problem begins when he want to destroy the original chain and sabotage it. 
Have you seen anyone to blame bitcoin gold or any other fork here?
@_date: 2018-11-07 00:38:12
only this lunatic Bitcoin Judas guy Roger Ver
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:22:47
yeah this was very slightly... lol  
       ""Increased my holdings of Bitcoin Cash today. There was a long need for a blockchain good for payments, 
         that makes certain tradeoffs to achieve that, and I think from a UX point of view, Bitcoin Cash has much 
          better chances of winning the upcoming payments war than LN.""  
Why anyone have tust you anymore when you openly say that you support bcash shitcoin?   
And who says that Bitcoin will fail if failed ln?  
And why bcash shitcoin that completely controlled by a bunch of scammers with the only motive to destroy Bitcoin is better than litecoin, dogecoin or any other altcoin out there?   
Whatever you say in the last months has raise a red alarm that you are not the old owner of this account and that you serve now a hidden agenda.

yeah. When the employer of Bic Camera give me to the talk to the phone with one girl from Bitflyer i told her that my payment has already 2 confirmation and the answer was that because the payment is already in blockchain they will refund me!

Imo this recent ledger's video is another example of bad marketing. Let me explain...
A common person that is not familiar with the cryptocurrency ecosystem will never understand what this guy talk about.
Crypto is a unknown world for the majority of the ppl and of the global market.
I dont understand why this startups not use the most well known brand name, Bitcoin, as the flagship that will get the most attention to customers for their product.
Except ledger dont like to expand their business and they want to keep their products to the small target group of cryptocurrency community.
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:15:38
this is and the main reason why this group of ppl always failed

This guy was dark for years and the last 8 months he start to be very active to social media with ridiculous ideas that have no sense.  
Before 4-5 months he said that bcash was an attack to bitcoin after that he propose the pow change for bitcoin to get the power from chinese miners and after that he says that he increase his bcash holdings... lol  
We can see all of this only as a joke but cobra has the admin of Bitcoin.org.

I will do the same comments here for this bad marketing strategy from Gemini. A common person that will read this label what will understand? Nothing... What is crypto? No one in this world really knows. 
Early adopters like Winklevoss and Gemini is like they are separate from reality. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:57:54
and i like to add to this that Jihan Wu and Bitmain will be a future lesson how someone can rekt his healthy business.    
Everything his have done is like to be desperate to bankrupt.   
Instead to just focus to Bitcoin and just continue to mine the most valuable coin in market and keep his leading position&gt;  
He start a negative campaign against Bitcoin and developers.  
He start spam attack to the network just to hurt Bitcoin  
He cancel over a year the upgrade of one of the most innovations for Bitcoin  
He fork the network and after that he sell his Bitcoin to buy 1 million Bcash at a price range of 3-4k dollars :D lol
He fork again the network of Bcash just to begin a bleeding hashwar over a dead chain loosing every day thousand of dollars.  
He sell again dozen of his remaining bitcoins only to support a rekt price of the BcashABC. The token price now is around 300$. As everyone remember this guy has already buy 1 million bcash at 3-4k each :D  
This guy is the most ridiculous economical person in whole crypto space.

A list that fit to Cobra-bitcoin:  
  
- Bitcoin is for everyday payments and to buy coffees (check)
- Bitcoin needs big blocks and for that reason bcash will succeed (check)
- Bitcoin Lightning network will fail and for that reason Bitcoin will doomed (check)
- Every other altcoin has failed and only Bcash will succeed as Bitcoin competitor (check)
  
I am sure that the old owner of cobra-bitcoin has sell his account. This guy sound like a bcash promoter now with all of this non tech bullshits that Roger Ver and Jihan, Craig Wright always says.

I dont know why the other part of this NY agreement not see this until now./
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:29:49
lol We will get rid off them until a new mining cartel will form again.  
pow change is not a solution.  
Bitcoin works perfect right now. The only problem is centralisation of mining asics right now but i think this problem will soon be solved.
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:28:32
not surprise. Is like the payed follower that all of this scammer has.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:40:39
there was not a civil war only a bunch of rich idiots that think they can control and hijack bitcoin. Nothing more
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:20:58
if bitcoin  has not so many jerks  around it now it will be at 10k$
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:43:02
yeah the truth is that Craig Wright is Satoshi, Roger Ver is a genius blockchain engineer and Jihan Wu alwasy act for the good of bitcoin...
get lost to your scam group.
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:58:08
viva la China
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:57:41
great! and HODL :D
a middle finger to all of this crap experst like Roubini, Krugman etc
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:12:38
segwit2x is doomed to failed without 100% consensus from bitcoin community. The situation after fork will be 4 chains, 2 of them without replay protection and 1 without devs or better with crap devs like Garzik and Gavin, What will go wrong? :P
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:38:27
Roger Ver is just a psycho. He promote a shitcoin that no one use it. Even dogecoin has more usage than bcash.
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:06:46
no. only to be the owner of your private keys and after this fork you will have tokens in both of chains. The same will happen if this bitcoin gpu fork in few days.
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:28:44
this happens after the hostile actions against bitcoin from specific companies, especially from Bitmain and Jihan Wu and the startups around him like Bitpay.  
Imo this reaction is very healthy. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:50:47
we cant. We can only see the differences. His writing style there is exactly the same with now. For the history Cobra was completely silent for years and only before some months begin to be active with the most post of it to have no sense.  
I dont care to have his opinion and to be to the conspiracy lunatic camp of r/btc. The problem is that this guy is an admin of a historical Bitcoin site and for sure will use it to promote his scam propaganda against bitcoin.
 This guys not even respect the thousand of hours that contributors volunteers to translate it. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:38:43
i also believe this. Free market and game theory can solve at long term any problem around bitcoin.  
It can solve even a chaotic situation like the November fork.  
Everyone need to have patient and watch all of this idiots that think they have any power to bitcoin to bankrupt 
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:32:43
"Are you daft or something?"  
normally i must say to you to go to f.. yourself after you break the NAP.  
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:37:04
i use the core client. Why you have to use something else?
@_date: 2016-09-20 22:26:50
Bitcoin not need the banking system and banking system not need bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:42:29
First he say that bcash is an attack to bitcoin. After that he propose an emergency pow change to "save" bitcoin for the evil Chinese miners and Jihan Wu. After that he says that ln will fail and for that reason he get plenty of bcash shitcoins... :P  
lol :D 
all of that is like a joke, ridiculous and for sure to laugh about.. But Cobra or the person that controls now cobra account is and the admin of Bitcoin.org site. This is very serious situation imo.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:56:34
Roger Ver is a libertarian my ass 
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:49:19
This guy is corrupt 
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:19:19
because he is a psycho paranoid illusion shithead

@_date: 2018-03-07 23:20:21
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:47:30
This fork will never happen. The ship has sink and now is rusting. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:46:14
you dont need to be genius to find out that Craig Wright is a scammer
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:22:08
because everyone already use it to transfer value with zero fees and instantly. There is a reason why has more txs from bcash
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:01:21
nice... Because everyone must upgrade now to core 0.15.0 :D
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:05:21
Someone to call Bitcoin President please!  
The situation is very serious... :P
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:26:29
is not only a hoaxer but and a drunk clown.  
Everyone must not forget that this scammer supported by Roger Ver, Jihad Wu and Garzik
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:36:47
the only reason is that Jihad cartel want the full control of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:08:03
The only one that destroy this lunatic is his mental health
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:11:14
If a bunch of startup CEo's and mining cartel can change so easy consensus rules of bitcoin then for sure Bitcoin is a failed experiment.   
Bitcoin is not for sure Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:13:42
To be clear this message was never debunked and this Satoshi's email was never compromised.   
And something else.  
Satoshi had never sign a message. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:05:20
Great news to break this Jihad's mining cartel
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:49:57
and Garzik says before months that this will take years. hahahahahahaha  
This guys are crap.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:06:22
i have also visit bicamera before some days and do 3 purchases with btc. Very smooth and good experience 
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:58:35
dont visit this cam site. They dont really talk about bitcoin but they talk about bcash. They are simple scammers and they want to steal bitcoins from users
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:12:07
i agree with that. This hard fork will be a great crush test for bitcoin and a great change all of this jerks to fork off from the network.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:27:16
The NYA plan was to everyone to follow this hard fork.  
Is very clear now that this will never happen and after the fork the NYA will be a new altcoin and not bitcoin.
Many exchanges will list it as an altcoin.  
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:45:23
there is a fork attempt for bitcoin that planed from Jihad mining cartel with some startups
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:02:33
someone must be completely fool to believe that this hoaxer scammer is Satoshi.  
The question is what are the real motives of Matonis, Ver, Jihan, Gavin and Garzik to support this scammer??
@_date: 2017-09-30 09:48:28
segwit2x will fall and without it.  
I dont think this NYA startups understand in waht mess they will enter after the fork and i dont think they have the resources to handle it especially  the high demand of customer support.  
Legacy chain will survive because it has the most skilled devs. I dont think segwit2x will survive in long term.
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:45:35
And before some months Jeff Garzik  said that this will take years.. lol :D
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:12:19
it only shows what will happen and to their next shitcoin after the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:44:20
this is another proof how low skilled dev is Garzik. A reminder that Garzik has not the best reputation in linux ecosystem.  
It seems he only transfer his crap skills and to bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:43:33
what is this shit ABC?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:08:38
i just block 480 nodes with this script
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:51:50
the sad is that you let this guy to hijack your community.
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:20:07
thx Satoshi! Whatever you are doing now you have begin a financial revolution. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:29:44
bitcoin.com is not at all a popular bitcoin wallet dude :P
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:59:51
and Andreas is not a lunatic like Ver
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:05:43
to understand everyone what we talk about Bitmex has 10x more usd volume trading from GDAX and x3 from Bitfinex
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:11:48
this has nothing to do with what i say. The old chain will survive. That for sure.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:48:33
i agree with this. Bitcoin will survive even from this attack. It seems many has understatement what bitcoin really is and why it gets value. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:08:33
maybe yes but especially pools are not miners. In many cases there are individuals that will not mine in a loss for a long time.
Bitcoin can survive with only a 10-20% of the current hashrate.
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:38:05
the only reason that Jihan support segwit2x fork is to destroy bitcoin and pump after that bcash
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:15:50
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:56:12
you dont need cryptographic skills to find out that Wright is a fraud and hoaxer.
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:03:11
and this "replay protection" not protect at all exchanges after the fork. A user of an exchange can still drain them very easy from the legacy or forked coins
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:58:11
who cares what this lunatic say? Do you think that anyone in this world will take serious a guy like Roger Ver?
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:46:30
@_date: 2018-03-10 01:00:00
dude we talk about a blockchain system not about a hard disk.. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:37:29
Let forkers burn their bitcoin and the rest of us get some free bitcoin from them.  
This guys are idiots that believe Bitcoin can fork because a bunch of CEos and miners decide it.  
Bitcoin is not like Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:39:25
free market and game theory can solve everything and Bitcoin for sure not need socialist decisions from a central group to "save" it.
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:38:49
A hoaxer, A lunatic and a complete unknown "who cares" third person pic.  
You can use it and as a joke.... 
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:22:44
i have the same exactly opinion. Segwit2x is a huge crash test for bitcoin. If survive from this then will be a signal to the world that Bitcoin is Here To Stay Forever.
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:58:17
Theymos has do too much for bitcoin and fight every day Roger Ver's bullsihits 
@_date: 2019-09-07 00:54:54
yeah we already know that... :P
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:50:25
Wright is a well known hoaxer. Even his title as a Dr is completely fake
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:45:11
Gemini will follow the rest of the market that handle this fork as an altcoin. Imo i dont think that this fork will ever happen. The ship has sink and ow is beginning to rust.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:01:34
i believe this but will never happen
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:35:19
this is another compromised bitcoin account that we have found out bought by Roger Ver to spread misleading propaganda against bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:59:23
and dont forget that this guys support the offensive chain split of bitcoin. Why holders like them support suicidal movements like this? Imo is a matter of psychiatrist :P
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:13:33
yes it is
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:07:17
this segwit2x is official DOA
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:53:32
have you ever try to speak in English with a Chinese guy? Is good to you that they don answer their phones :P
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:01:34
with this fork Bitcoin will get rid all of this clowns
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:59:25
everyone can see to his face what a psycho lunatic is
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:25:00
heh? is a scam? and who have scammed you? And how money have you lost if someone scam you?
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:24:48
yeah me too
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:54:00
How this upgrade will happen? I dont think bitcoin devs will choose miners to activate this soft fork. It will be a kind of UASF&gt;?
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:53:29
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:52:43
If blockchain.info fork from the network then for sure will be a customer support mess with the huge spike of complains.
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:22:58
the same happen to segwit. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:05:36
Garzik  has a great history with epic failed predictions.  
Some others...  
1. Mining will collapse after halving.  
2. No one will use bitcoin because of the high fees  
3. That he is the most important dev in btc ecosystem.. lol again :D
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:20:44
he talk about bcash and no bcash made from Jihad's mining cartel not fighting anything
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:38:15
me to. I will be out. I dont want to participate to a central control system.
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:02:33
Startups like Xapo has an illusion that customers will blindly follow them in every ridiculous decision will do.  
One only word for this.  
lol   
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:11:10
to be fair ob team is from the beginning supporters of bitcoin scale through hard fork. They point to my view is that fees is not at all their number 1 problem to their app. They have first to solve huge tech problem and imo is a waste of resources this team to fight everyday a scaling debate with whole community of bitcoin.  
This fighting is and the main reason why so many ppl turn their back to a great app like ob.  
Imo is a poor decision from ob developers team. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:28:30
and 7 years after there is a serious hijack attempt to transform bitcoin to a central control corporate system
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:14:20
hey dude... Only dogs has bosses. Humans has economical working relationships. If you can understand what i am talking about.. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:28:39
this guy can hear you only if you give him some thousands of $.
@_date: 2019-09-11 23:32:25
i dont know why every early adopt startups to Bitcoin space have transform to the most crap companies. Is not only Bitpay but and Blockchain.info etc
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:57:32
lol you dont really know what you talk about 
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:04:01
Ver knows better... :P
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:01:20
free market and game theory can stabilise and solve even this crisis. Mining with asics has more changes to be decentralised in near future than a mining with gpu or pos or both of them.  
Jihan Wu and all of this idiots that support him they are near in bankrupt.  
Relax and see this to happen. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:30:34
i have buy many things to BIC Camera also
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:16:27
the only thing that can damage is their pocket. That for sure.
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:26:14
for sure Satoshi not give this domain to cobra but to another person than transfer the ownership to cobra.
For that reason cobra is not the legitimise owner of bitcoin.org.
@_date: 2018-07-08 13:10:20
yes they do but be careful to Bic Camera they will not accept payments with replace by fee set
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:16:07
we still have G2A and Kinguin 
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:16:19
yeah i know but i think there are still many ppl that use the bitcoin-qt even to prune mode.
Imo is the safest wallet to store and use your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 19:11:26


@_date: 2018-07-11 22:11:49
this has nothing to do with bitcoin. Post it to r/paypal or whatever
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:07:58
and the rest of payment processors are very simple to use them. this is the reason why the most merchants drop bitpay and use them now.
  You must remember that Bitpay create a confusion to customers and merchants with this Bitcoin Cash promotion.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:51:06
they have break the "promise" just after few days with this silly bcash fork. What they talk about?
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:33:32
and why a merchant to use bitpay and not a more flexible payment processor with more options and choices and with a 100% bitcoin wallet support?  
Every vps and server provider that i used to pay with bitpay they have now drop them and use other payment processors.  
imo bitpay lost ground and has if they continue like this they will not have any future at all. We are to 2018 not to 2013 dude.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:50:24
spectrocoin is better
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:27:32
for sure you dont need to care about it. Is surprise to me that Bitcoin still have this market share when anyone can easily do an ico or a shitcoin and create a market cap from thin air.  
@_date: 2018-07-22 00:34:54
is already raised. Many blocks are above 2mb right now
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:05:29
i sell them at 0.2-03. I only like to thx Jihan Wu, Roger Ver and every ridiculous charlatan out there for this free bitcoin :
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:42:22
it seems so. This guys that support this fork are simple jerks and it seems they will do it.If bitcoin has not around so many jerks will be now at 10k$ 
@_date: 2015-04-07 12:52:53
There is no Blockchain without tokens(bitcoin)
@_date: 2018-07-08 21:47:16
it seems one by one bcash shitcoiners come back to Bitcoin. The future of bcash is not so bright anymore :D
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:21:12
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:12:04
this was never debunked and this Satoshi's email where NEVER compromised 
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:28:42
Bitpay think that is still 2013.  
There are much better choices for merchants today.  
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:15:51
63 contracts atm. Not bad for such a new market
@_date: 2018-07-14 19:45:44
social engineer attack that do now Jihan Wu and Roger Ver, patent attack that do now Craig Wright and nchain, selfish mining that always do Jihan wu and Bitmain, spam attack that have done several times Jihan Wu and Bitmain, corruption attack to startup through investing that have done severl times Jihan wu and Bitmain.  
Is surprise that Jihan Wu be a billionaire from bitcoin and now attack bitcoin. He reminds this idiom "You never shit/defecate where you eat"
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:29:35
This is the new ethos of the forked bitcoin or how this scammers want to transform bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-14 18:41:19
I am sure that Roger Ver when he talks about bitcoin he means the Chinese bitcoin fork that he support. And no. A Chinese  central control coin with 99% of nodes to three data centers and 100% mining and development control by Jihan is not a way to economic freedom.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:16:38
i dont think this NYA startup owners really understand with what mess will enter after this fork. 4 chains, 2 without replay protection and 1 of them without skilled devs. What will go wrong? For sure they will need to scale x10 and their customer support service.
@_date: 2015-04-20 23:25:36
I am from Greece. I can tell you that they knew nothing about bitcoin and they i am very sure that they dont want to know..
We have a very small bitcoin community
@_date: 2015-09-03 23:17:27
who cares what you support?
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:42:37
this was not funny at all :P
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:15:56
this was just after the ridiculous hijack attempts from Gavin. This first fork attempt was the beginning from the bitcoin fork drama.  
Gavin Andressen is the only responsible for this bitcoin community split. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:10:51
you must be the first person that says bitcoin.com is a popular wallet. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 16:36:27
because the most of people that invest there lost their money. Is full of scammers and the bitlendingclub the same. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:15:14
i think that home small mining is the future fo bitcoin mining. in my opinion the big farm mining is going to an end especially after the block split of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-04 23:37:58
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:58:13
yeah i have recieve that spam payment and i have read the message in blocklchain.info . It is obvious a scam
@_date: 2015-09-15 12:14:28
circle.com i think is what you want
@_date: 2015-09-30 16:34:31
WTF? hearn is the mots pathetic member of bitcoin community..
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:25:45
this agreement has break from Bcash hard fork.  
I dont know why this guys still follow it but it will be an epic fail for them and a great opportunity for Bitcoin to get rid off all of this charlatans.
@_date: 2015-09-10 23:35:39
get out of that silly spam game. This is their plan to spam the bitcoin network. To give away hundreds of private address and to stress test the network from people that going to claim that bitcoin. They are scammers!!
@_date: 2015-09-09 17:14:30

no it was not like this. Satoshi never entrusted bitcoin.org to Cobra but as i know to another guy( i dont remember his name) and this guy after a while transfer the ownership to Cobra.  
Imo the original owner of Cobra account sell it to an unknown person, maybe to ppl close to Jihan Wu or Roger Ver. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:58:13
why anyone to use this crap method and not to just split his coin?

i suggest you to run a node to a vps server.
There are really cheap vps out there with only 10$ per months and with specs that you need to run a full node.  
one of them is time4vps   
  
one other option is to buy a raspberry pi and to setup there a 24/7 home mining. There is a guide to do it here  
  
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:03:14
Bitcoin.com is another proof how ridiculous person is Roger Ver.
He get the Bitcoin name and he made a site with bet, casino, crap feed news and a bunch of shilling a chinese shitcoin fork of Bitcoin.  
This guy is completely lunatic.
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:15:27

I also believe that this fraud is a good change from everyone to get some easy money from Roger Ver.
Someone only need to go to bitcoin.com buy some bcash and then lawsuit Roger Ver as fraud because you believe that you buy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:27:04
i think Bitcoin business operators and roger ver because he is with them did not understand that bitcoin and the people that using don't need anymore the old financial system. We want to change it or to completely destroy it and create something new. 
Instead in their opinion bitcoin must change to be a small part of this old system. this is wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:09:06
There are dozens of bitcoin forks and one of them is chinese shitcoin bcash.  
Bitcoin is by design open to forks. Everyone that not like how the system works is free to fork off from the network. This happen with bcash from the chinese miners.

There are rumours that Coinbase has serious economical problems and maybe will be the next MTGox. 
Anyone remember when Coinbase get an investment?
For that reason and their desperate movement to ethereum to save them.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:03:01
this is one of the rare interest ideas about a smart contract but we must see it in the economical env how will works because as i understand you keep a value of tokens to an ether token smart contract. In crypto world economy something like this can easy exploit.  
For the smart contracts i only say that ethereum has very wrong approach how it create them. this system to be better must reconstruct from the ground. For that reason i say a better system will happen in the future for sure and will not ethereum and for sure not bitcoin because bitcoin is design not to do funky things with it but to transfer money without the needing of middle man.
@_date: 2016-05-31 01:03:55
and what Coinbase has done for bitcoin? Bitcoin has done more for them. They dont even pay a developer or to spent some money to write better code or something like that.
There was always exchanges and better before them and there will  be and after them.

@_date: 2017-05-25 20:50:20
yes but bitcoin developers avoid to propose a hf block increase for this main reason . To not fork the network and not create a mess, and now we all pump a minority hard fork? If this happen why not anyone to use litecoin and instead to use the new bitcoin segwit altcoin?  
The point for UASF is to lure miners and economical nodes, the majority to support it so segwit to activate to bitocin even without the MINORITY of jihan and his puppets. Not to fork off from the network.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:52:09

my question remain. Why all of you support a well know exposed hoaxer scammer like Wright?

that for sure and not only in bitcoin but this economical collapse will have and a great effect to the whole crypto system. But the point is that  it exist miners, startups etc that want to take the risk to loose everything only for an illusion that there a market demand for a central control bitcoin.  
I really hope this guys to do their fork and learn in hard way that you never try to fix something that works and has great value.

I have use it for several altcoin trades but i dont understand how this system protect you if something goes wrong.
In my example i have done a trade from btc to eth. It seems that the programme see the bitcoin blockchain transactions but is not see the ethereum blockchain finished transactions.
Maybe i am wrong but to end the trade bitsquare ask the user to mark it as complete.
And the question is what happen if the user never sent eth for the trade as in my case?
What happen if a sepa transaction is not complete and the buyer not sent the money?
How the system protect both of the parts in that situations?
@_date: 2016-05-22 23:40:16

ViaBTC is Jihan's puppet and for that reason they will create this abc plan b.  
I think they already know that a hard fork will never happen even with segwit2x and they prepare themselves to create their own forked chain.  
The question now is.  
Who will use this chain?  
Who will use a chain that central controlled from a Jihan, that has not the brand name of bitcoin and that has not the users and dev quality of it?

it seems that there is a small group of startups, miners and ppl that think they can create a new digital paypal based in bitcoin with central control, data centers nodes and governance with presidents etc. 
This same group of ppl seems to have a strong belief that exist a huge market demand for this new "paypal-bitcoin".  
No one can change their minds for this and for that reason i think this ppl has not place to the bitcoin chain and must fork themselves asap from it.

and f2pool just stop to support it.  
The support hashrate now is below 80% and maybe will be less if and another pool leave this agreement.   
Especially if the rest of 20-30% of hashrate begin to support bip148 -UASF then for sure in  long terms UASF chain will become the longest chain and will wipeout every transaction, bitcoin from the legacy chain.    
In simple words and geme theory terms if segwit2x fails to activate segwit until 1 August then UASF will be the new reality in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-03 23:42:01

i have also lost respect for Bipay. I think there is a great change a new competitor to get their place. Bitpay thinks that their customers will blindly follow them whatever they do. this is wrong. this startup grow up because many ppl trust them and use their platform. Bitcoin users are their customers but they seems to turn now against them. If they continue to do this they will have for sure the future of Circle. No one will remember them.

@_date: 2017-07-08 17:48:07
and why you think that exist a huge market demand for a central controlled bitcoin or worst for a slow paypal system?  
Do you know what is the real usage of bitcoin and who are using it right now?  
For sure there is a demand of ppl to avoid banking system and to avoid the old financial system. For that reason and bitcoin price spike to 2500$   
And to this demand the startup ecosystem built around.  
You can lure the free market to your will whatever power you have.  
In tech history we have seen great failure when someone try to do this.

@_date: 2017-07-08 13:24:13
sorry to say that is not personal offence but your post show the lack of understanding how bitcoin works, not only from you but as it seems for many ppl in bitcoin ecosystem.  
Miners need users and usage to keep mining. Because without them their token will has not high value. Especial in bitcoin case a suddenly drop of usage will create a big loss from mining profits.  
The mining as it is now is built to support a price of 2000$+.  
In a scenario that miners will fork off from network and their token cant catch this price quickly then for sure the mining companies will have an economical loss or they will decide to mine in both chains.  
This in long terms means only one chain will survive. And the chain that will survive wil be this with the most users.  
And not think anyone that if you have support from startups like Blockchain.info, Bitpay or whatever mean that you will have and the users from them.  
This startups built around users demand. The free market work only for customers demand. And bitcoin ecosystem Bitcoin users are the customers of the startups
@_date: 2017-07-14 23:49:38

if segwit activate before 1 August then UASF nodes will accept this chain as it is.
If this not happen then UASF chain even with 1 block can easily take over the legacy chain if became the longest chain.  
Because if this happen legacy chain will reorg, wipe out every transaction that happen until then and follow after UASF chain.

@_date: 2016-07-02 14:51:22
It seems that now is corrected. Imo i still believe that Craig Wright name must removed completly from bitcoin page. He has nothing to do with bitcoin history. He is a hoaxer and only in Satoshi wikipedia page seems to have a place his name as someone that failed to claim to be satoshi.

imo bip9 is the greatest mistake of Bitcoin developers and is a question why not anyone think about the dangers to give such power to miners especially when this miners is a kind of cartel.  
Jihan use this soft fork activation method to transform himself to a defacto leader and ruler of bitcoin future.  
@_date: 2016-07-19 12:04:45
The fact is that whatever support this guys a disaster follow.
I like the black cats of crypto ecosystem.
1. They have support Ethereum and after a while happens the DAO disaster.
2.Interview for bitcoin price in Bloomberg and after a while a great btc dump and a mini btc price crash.
I expect the same with this ethereum hard fork :D
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:03:02

@_date: 2017-07-08 12:49:12
i agree with that. imo this fork will for sure not be The Bitcoin but in the bset scenario will be another crap shitccoin. My question is why this guys not fork already from the network and what are they waiting for?

i dont need to read a mythistorical story. I will stay to the cryptographic evidence. And all the evidence that this hoaxer give us is completely fake. It was back in September and it was and now. Why i need to read the story of a scammer? He has obvious nothing to do with bitcoin history. He has not even the same political theory as Satoshi has.

Jihan Wu case is a good lesson for how NOT to management a company. This guy had dominate biitcoin mining space and instead to continue to focus to this space what Jihad do?   
 He start to fight Bitcoin developers, after that blackmail bitcoin community and try to push his crap tech agenda and in the end he fork Bitcoin and now he has in stake 2 millions shitcoin (ABC + SV) that will never able to sell to the market.

0.50$ is not a high fee and bitcoin still works great. It will work great even if the price will double and the fees will be 1-2-3$. Is a very cheap payment and secure system to transfer money around the world in many cases anonymous and without the needing of banking system.

@_date: 2017-06-10 12:02:38
status quo is not a hostage situation because bitcoin continue works as it design. If anyone believe that segwit is the beginning and the end of bitcoin then he must get lost of it and use an altcoin asap.  
I cant see this rush for a "revolution".  
I am a big supporter of tech solution of segwit but i know that Bitcoin is a consensus system.  
And consensus means that changes happens only if anyone agree to them and not if anyone agree to my opinion or tech solution.  
i strongly believe that segwit sooner or later will activate and everyone must have patient and not fall to fork proposal like this new Luke-jrCoin or JihanCoin or whatever.  
The real value of bitcoin is not because a group of ppl can do funky things with it.
