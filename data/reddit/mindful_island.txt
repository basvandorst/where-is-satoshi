I've been looking into hardware wallets the past week and still don't feel comfortable. On any site that sells them, 10% of the reviews talk about serious issues. The Trezor seems slightly more reliable than the Ledger Nano, but neither seem reliable enough.

Have you taken some basic finance and investment classes? Free classes are all over the place online. Good idea to beef up on general knowledge before getting involved in speculative investments like bitcoin.

Sorry I didn't! That or I sent them to him in private message.
Go to each of the sites, coursera.org and futurelearn.com - in the search boxes, type stuff like "finance" or "investment". Take the courses! :)
