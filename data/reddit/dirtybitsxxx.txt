"She said Kennedy, from Bristol, attacked one woman after she said she did not want to have sex with him, despite her asking him to stop.
Ms Elder said: 'She described herself as screaming and crying during the intercourse.
'She said that it hurt. She asked him to stop."
He's a rapist. STFU

I just bought a nano because I cant wait for trezor to support ether.  They've been saying its right around the corner but with no updates which has been a bummer.
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:57:27
5% percent seems pretty pathetic.

Can you copy the the text?  I need to do some financial reevaluation.    This is a huge financial blow for me.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:34:19
I would be great to see them try and make it right.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:59:26
Im assuming this information is for the people that have "decided" weren't hacked.  
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:44:52
Dont give this bottom feeder a minute of your time.  You got any sane persons support.  This guy isnt right in the head.  Kudos to you for putting that little shit in jail. You have NO obligation to debate what rape is with this little loser shit stain.
@_date: 2016-08-08 07:01:50
This interview is a disaster. 
-has no information on the hack
-has no information about assets available to set things right
-seems to say that Bitfinex will no be participating in the loss

**Kennedy attacked one woman** after **she said she did not want to have sex** with him, despite **her asking him to stop**.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:36:10
Please don't waste a moment on this piece of crap.  Let him whine to his mens rights group that women wont fuck him.  You were raped.  You went to court and presented your case which was very brave and the evidence backed you up.  Decent humans have your back.  Rape apologists like this are scum. Seriously don't even read this thread, you indeed protected other women from this asswipe.  Much respect to you.

@_date: 2016-08-04 00:10:03
I dont know, they havent spelled it out.  The language they are using suggests they are considering some accounts hacked and others not... so I'm not sure.  Also not sure if people will be able to withdraw other coins (ether/ltc) or if its all considered one pot.  
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:46:12
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:11:13
Yep.  And so is u/EivindBerge. If you have sex w someone who has said no and is telling you to stop you are a rapist.  If you are a rapist apologist I can only assume you are scared impotent little twit.
@_date: 2016-08-09 23:45:44
Incredible.  You said that some of the wallets that were emptied were not costumers but that the 36% percent haircut applied to customers was not applied to bifinex.  Id imagine you are saying birfinex took a greater cut because that would be the decent thing to do.  But you arent saying that, you arent saying anything which is incredibly suspicious. 
Did the company assets take 36% or greater loss like the customers did?  Or were costumer funds used to restore bitfinex assets?
@_date: 2016-08-17 14:53:29
Thats about as vague as this update.  I thought it was sarcastic until I checked your post history.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:46:44
So if the website comes up and our bitcoins are there... when withdrawals are allowed can we take them?  And what about other coins?
@_date: 2016-08-22 19:34:19
Agreed.  Bitgo wasn't hacked, they failed.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:03:01
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:43:28
Respectfully, if my email or password had ben compromised I would have said **I** was hacked... my security was compromised.  In this case it was you who were hacked, your security was compromised.  Customers of Bitfinex had no part in the security of your system.  
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:35:20
Again you are looking at one out off 11 cases.  The other ones were clearly physically forced.  
Im done giving you attention, creep.

Great investment. The return you get from these things are insane.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:16:51
Apparently they've updated so you don't have to anymore
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:53:18
IMO Trezor has one weakness and that is that you have to enter your seed into your computer. Thats a deal breaker for me.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:48:20
That really cool, I'll def pick up a print!  I was just thinking about cassascius coins and seeing if anyone sold them and was remembering what a big part of the community Mike was back in the day.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:16:08
Thats great, they didn't have that when I was using the trezor.
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:46:43
I understand how you feel... but I think of it like this... I own a bar, I paid 45k for a license to sell liquor to the public. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:08:52
I'm a bussiness person, I have investors... why not just tell the truth?  We can't pay you back, we have no capital. then offer an alternative solution.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:02:31
Yeah, its on the higher end.... in LA and NY it can be 100K-200K

This is exactly what I was talking about. Looks far off from being close to developed. I would use it today if it was available.
@_date: 2015-05-30 15:01:25
Thank you. I'm sure this is difficult.
@_date: 2014-06-16 01:20:23
I might not see that one coming either.  Thanks for putting the warning out here.
@_date: 2014-07-16 23:01:27
I just put my bitcoin down as an asset for a loan too.  
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:36:30
Wow.  What an F-U Thats like saying 'oops, you were totally right. But we still aren't going to reimburse you'  It would be less insulting to pay you nothing.  Especially for someone who is using their site and dropping 5k bets.  That is bad business.  Glad you are posting about it.
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:33:29
Thank you!  That I get.
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:08:15

@_date: 2014-06-02 16:31:58
Ouch.  I'm so sorry.  Hopefully coin base and who ever is controlling the gox wallets will get it back for you.  In the meantime I hope they come back more valuable than when you lost them.  Good luck.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:44:51
Isn't that part of why people drop huge bets?  For the butt kissing that comes with it ;)
@_date: 2017-01-03 23:46:08
These people have been shit talking Ethereum since its start, when you could but in at 25 cents per ether.  I think there are some hurt feeling about it not being the failure they hoped it would be.  also they are probably 13.

You are right. Thanks
@_date: 2015-07-18 04:12:24
So what happens in those cases? The seller loses their bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:49:04
People buy and pay you via Paypal?  and you don't get scammed?
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:58:08
How do you not get scammed by  a buyer using paypal.  Don't they just retract the funds and keep your bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-18 06:24:44
So it's sell at your own risk.  What is the escrow for, just to facilitate the initial transaction? 
@_date: 2018-03-04 04:33:17
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:20:12

I don't believe they have a partnership with MasterCard.  I would encourage this to be fact checked.
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:57:17
Don't get me wrong, I'd be your biggest fan if this happens.  I would just like to see more solid info on the project before I can get excited.  But good luck, truly.

Maybe we should follow Scientology's lead and become a religion :/
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:45:19
ofc i would
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:59:02
Sorry, this sounds to good to be true.  Zero fees? Partnered with Mastercard?  Frankly, I don't believe you.   I googled your name and there isn't much at all.  Waiting for the next step where you ask for crowd funding and disappear.  If you want to be taken seriously I suggest you put some more real, solid info out there about you and your team.
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:40:47
I understand that.  But they are claiming a "partnership" with Mastercard, and they do not have that anymore than I have a "partnership" with mastercard because I have one in my wallet.
@_date: 2016-10-02 19:10:59
Where do i send my money?

@_date: 2015-02-03 18:12:43
Sorry it happened to you.
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:39:17
Me neither.  I messaged the seller and asked him to pick someone from bitrate.  Thank you everyone.
