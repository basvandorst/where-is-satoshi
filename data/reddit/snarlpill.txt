New here. Just checked the site though and got this: Proxy Error
The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
The proxy server could not handle the request GET /.
Reason: Error reading from remote server

Made me laugh, so true though. 
And about the handtrucks2go site, I see that they already even have the "Bitcoin accepted here" sign at the bottom. Good for them.

I thought that was beautifully written for an obituary piece. RIP Hal Finney, a great mind and person.

Thanks brother! 
Also saw in your reply where you said they were stuck with the wait from exchanges. I've used coin.mx about 5-10 times for instant BTC, always legit. Instant purchases with credit/debit once verified though, and that can be done with a quick cell video. Price is a little higher there however; arbitrage opportunity!

Congrats on Satoshi Forest, and thank you for all you've done in giving people a chance at life who most people would walk away from. 
It's not much, but I've had my BTC Faucet site running for a few months, and have a Sean's Outpost donation address listed above that people can donate their BTC dispense to. It's not much, but if BTC is worth 10k one day, those little amounts will add up. You can check my faucet out here: 
Good Luck with all future plans!

Exactly. Small amounts are given out, though there are usually 11,000+ transactions of them a day at the moment. I currently give out approx. 0.0167 BTC a day total to all users, which as you can imagine, adds up quickly. The ads are there only to balance out the BTC I am paying out to users. It is good for new users; I got started on some faucets myself after Googling ways of getting into BTC. Mass adoption, baby.

Hey, just saw this. Pretty new to Reddit and though I've lurked here and there for a while. If you're currently digging Do I Wanna Know by the AM, you might also enjoy Are You Mine by them; similar sound. 
 A tip would be Great! Would also be first time receiving a tip on Reddit!
