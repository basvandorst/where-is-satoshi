Maybe something can be done using 'sidechains'. Anyway the security level is given by the Proof of Work and we must have the proper incentives. Multiplying the tokens is not an answer, and the security level will be below Bitcoin itself.
The only thing I'm sure, Etherum is not the answer; Running a full node is not possible anymore. Etherum is more and more centralized. The top application seems to be around 1000 users by day, this is low. This looks like a lot of money for nothing.

BCH: Attract an army of scammer...
Nevertheless, Bitcoin is stronger now, features reducing the decentralization level are now gone. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency  not controlled by a small group of people, and so achieve a perfect no 'trust party' involvement at any level.
The sound money policy and the 'store of value' effect is the true feature behind the price increase over the years.
ICO and BCH in a  way try to imitate the process with a huge marketing machine; But the real nature of Bitcoin is money and we only need one.

On the top 15 of coinmarketcap, I see only three legitimate ones without doubtful features (premine, huge marketing with phony information, etc...). We had so many ICO printing money. And all these coins are correlated in value with Bitcoin; I doubt that we will have a new successful bull run until Bitcoin is back over 70%.
The true feature giving Bitcoin is rise in value over the years is the store value effect, with a fully decentralized network, and without any single point of failure. Bitcoin is alone in this realm, all other are under the control of a small team.
Bitcoin is sound money and we need only one.

A wonderful eulogy for the 'soft money' of the cryptocurrency space.

Bitcoin is sound money. Bitcoin is not optional and is alone with the proper properties.
