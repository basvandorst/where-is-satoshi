You are correct. It isn't even people using fake id's either. Some dude skated with 55 all using his real name. His name was John or johnathan. Their model is extremely flawed and unless fixed I don't see them being around very long. I would only lend small amounts to people want small loans (5 or less) but than the so called interest u recieve isn't really worth it.

What a joke! No worries it's not like he teaches the youth of America...
We should set a bounty for a student in his class to ask him why he keeps getting emerging financial and economic technologies so wrong, and why the class should listen to him at all? What benefit does it give them in their future to listen to this dinosaur? What makes him an authority figure and capable of teaching students when his head is so far up his ass?

You sir are one hell of a troll. 
I don't car about Africa? I just want the value to increase? This is about me? All I did was post about asking the World Bank questions about bitcoin in regards to inequality. You come out of nowhere with your blanketed statements about me and Africa (which this was not about) as if your thoughts and statements are facts, and accusing me of spewing unhelpful dangerous bullshit. You have no idea of my holdings, I can tell you this, even if bitcoin increased 100x I would not be rich off my holdings. So please try again.
"Bitcoin is great and has many uses but at this time, this is not one of them" says who? The simpleton troll floodle on reddit. So one of "bitcoins great and many uses" can't be to help inequality? Get bent dude!

No tap out here bud, just some quality time with the family
It's not about buying stuff online. It's about transferring money to someone else in their village/city. Not having to open up a bank acct or depend on financial institutions.
The beauty is Bitcoin will/can compete in all markets, it can succeed as a currency, store of wealth, payment system, or a blockchain technology. Any one of these things will change the world, it could easily do all. obviously not at this moment, but in the future. 
The smartest people in the room are working on bitcoin or blockchain technologies. Please don't be so short sighted on this. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 21:24:31

Why would it be better if it was $1 to be a currency?
Why buy gold when bitcoin can be used at more places, can be moved easier, and is a better investment?
Also bitcoin doesn't have to make it as a "currency" to succeed and rise in value. It will flourish as a payment system because of this:
Instant transactions, 
no checks lost in the mail,
no waiting for checks to clear, 
no chargebacks (merchants like this), 
no account freezes (look out Paypal), 
no international wire transfer fee, 
no minimum balance, 
no maximum balance, 
worldwide access, 
always open, 
no waiting for business hours to make 
no waiting for an account to be approved, 
open an account in a few seconds, 
as easy as email, 
no bank account needed, 
extremely poor people can use it, 
extremely wealthy people can use it, 
no possibility of hyper-inflation,
no printing press, 
no debt limit votes,
no bank bailouts,
and completely voluntary. 
People need to stop looking at bitcoin (crypto) as this or that. It is a disruptive innovative technology. It not only disrupts currency but payment networks, and in the future who knows with smart contract.

This is why cryptocurrency will win. These people can't be bought or persuaded to stop. They probably need to watch their back. If anything did happen to more would take there place. This is what happens when govt and institutions get to big and greedy, and neglect to many all to the benefit a few. We in America are blind to the rest of the worlds problems, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS. technology could make life easier and liveable for so many around the world, but there is no incentive to share or innovate in certain parts, this will change, we are moving to a global consensus. We live in fascinating times! Keep up the good work guys.

Even the trolls, who do provide "a" perspective, even if to just strengthen our resolve. The reality of the situation is that we are doing something positive - if we succeed - that people, who will never read this, will appreciate. We feel we are on the right side of history. And when there are this many people that feel the same way, we're either right or there is a serious problem in society. So CHEERS, cuz the future is guaranteed to be interesting, to say the least.

Favorite verse:
Through the lights cameras and action, glamour glitters and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
to conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my Wisdom, with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm grungy, but things I do is real it never haunts me
while, funny style niggaz roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Riker's Isle
Holdin weed inside they pussy with they minds on the
pretty things in life, props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggaz come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
Guns salute life, rapidly, that's the ritual

You will be just as happy with smaller banks. Your banking there feeds their greed.

Hey Reggie, I have always respected and liked your views on the financial industry and the economy. I am always interested in your projects. I have a few questions for you. 
Is there 2 ultra coins out there? The google box shows your ultra coin with your face and all on the site, then there is another without you anywhere on it.
Isn't this pretty much like ethereum, with contracts?
How do you feel about the recent talk about sidechains
@_date: 2014-09-24 04:51:17
Aww, did that hit a chord with you too? Again this is reddit, not a white paper. Also it's not petty attacks, it's observations because I know many, many like you. Guess what bud, most people don't like you. Most who come in contact with you think you're a smug assclown. That's why the grammar nazi/superiority complex doesn't have many different and fruitful relationships outside of their keyboard. It's to bad the Bitcoin community is full of pompous assholes like yourself correcting people and telling them to improve. Thankfully, this won't always be the case. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 13:34:05
Nobody has been yapping about hyper inflation until the last 5 years, when the fed started QE. The reason for the yapping is that no country has ever successfully expanded the money supply (especially the amounts we are doing today) without a huge financial meltdown. The only reason we are seemingly getting away with it (for time being) is cuz of 2 things, 1 our dollar is spread through out the world. 2 banks are not lending. So the 2 things you want to keep an eye out for, have the banks started lending again (expanding credit) which will increase the velocity, and are foreign countries dumping our dollars. The latter is more likely the scenario since we like to sanction the big boys and go to war with the jabronies.

There should be a push to get prostitutes to accept bitcoin, and give a discount. That's where the real "awakening" will take place. C'mon Brazilian bitcoiners, get that done!

Don't be so simple. No one is saying if Africa uses bitcoins Africans become wealthier. It's an easier way for them to be paid, store, and use money if/when they provide value or service to their neighbor/community/society.
Your last sentence contradicts the one before it. 
I assume the alternative that "works well for them" is MPesa. Only a handful of countries in Africa use this. Still Mpesa could be better streamlined and cheaper with the use of bitcoin. 
So instead of being dismissive and simple, why not think a little more because what has been happening, what we use now, and what "works well for them" isn't quite cutting the mustard for the world.
