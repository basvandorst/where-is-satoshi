He said Bitcoin mining is using up a lot of data, which I don't think is true. Especially not in the USA since most mining is done elsewhere

Go look at the new tax brackets. The poor and middle class are getting a tax cut. You don't need to spread lies.

If you're so sure of it going down, go ahead and short it then, but don't cry when you go bankrupt.

Math is a bit off. There aren't 21m  coins in existance currently. Theres 17.3m, and of those probably at least 2-3m are lost forever, so really let's say 14.3m coins.
($20 x 7B) / 14.3M = $9,790/BTC if everyone owned $20 worth.

There's accounting methods called FIFO and LIFO. First in first out, last in last out. You need to choose a method and stick with that method. If you do LIFO then the most recent Bitcoin you bought, is the first Bitcoin you've sold.

If you buy Bitcoin, the price rises, then you buy a product or service with the Bitcoin, you also owe taxes then.

Not true. The DA dropped those charges last week. So it's not proven or disproved.
