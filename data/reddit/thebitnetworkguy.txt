That's your money now. I would recommend you to hodl until BTC=15-20k instead 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:03:20
You can dubbel spend, buy something with a higher tx. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:16:58
Hello ~17k, Told you
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:28:20
Lightning Network for BTC inc

I think that you have done something wrong. I made a transaction with $18 and got the amount to my other wallet in 40min. You are probably sending BTC from an exchange which is pending because of their verification.

Wait for the big drop? People have Been waiting for that drop since $900. Dream on

After the fork
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:17:29
If I was in your shoes I would probably move your coins to coindesk or like me, ledger wallet! Better to be 100% then 50% sure!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:12:19
Sorry for you sir, you just lost about 9k.
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:10:56
I would not order from amazon, there is a small chance of them already being used. Buy from the original website!
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:21:10
I don't have anything to say about Trezor, never tried it but ledger wallet works like a charm! Regarding forks and hardware wallets there's no difference between them and "online" wallets like coinbase, blockchain.info and so on! The creator to the wallet just has to support the fork to split the wallet! Ledger supports b2x fork and so will coinbase do! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:54:28
Lol. Have you seen the chart? It doesn't go that low from any drops. There will have to be some big news to drop it that low from where it is right now. It will go down to 9,5-10 if It drops NOW, if goes up to 12,5 it will drop down to 10-11
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:17:05
Yes that's correct! If you have 5btc when the fork is happening, you'll have 5b2x as well! Everyone will wait with their 5b2x until it rises and the BAAAM dump them to buy more bitcoins!
I would guess that the price will go down to 5,8-6300 somewhere between there!
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:56:06
I recommend ledger if you are interested in hardware wallets, very easy to use and will support b2x!
If you want to use an online wallet I prefer coinbase because of its reputation and easy to use GUI!
If you have anymore questions regarding the fork or wallets overall, just hola at me!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:51:00
Yes, If you read the reddit posts instead of posting, you should Know the answer 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:44:14
Hold on to your bitcoins you have at the moment, if everything seems to work out fine after the b2x fork, invest about 2k each week and see how everything plays out!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:29:29
Best Regards BNGuy
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:10:27
Everyone is buying ALOT of BTC now before the fork because they will have the same amount of b2x as BTC. After that, the price will calm down and be corrected... Save this post and comment after the fork! I want to be able to tell you "I told you so" "wink" ;)
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:13:14
You My friend just won $6,000!!! 
No but seriously, are you stupid?
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:08:56
I am doing as following:
Buying my bitcoins at localbitcoins.com, I do not trust their Wallet, It seems to have a bad security. So I take the bitcoins I just purchased and send it to greenaddress wallet which works on any platform and is highly secure and hard to track. 
IMO use greenaddress as a wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:36:15
Tried Google?
Bitcoin = Digital Currency which is much like euro &amp; dollar.
Difference between bitcoin and other exchanges owned by the government is that this is a currency by the people for the people. No government is controlling it, it is hard to track and so on. You can read more at other websites like CoinDesk, bitcoin.org etc...
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:53:12
WE are currently at block 491312, the fork is happening at 491407! So I guess 1-2H maybe?
*EDIT: probably around 3-7h
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:17:29
As the earlier responses, it will always raise in the future, hold on to your bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:14:56
I wonder how bitcoin Gold will be affecting the price of BTC at the moment. Seems like BTG fork is the only thing everyone is talking about at the moment. We should probably go hard towards those who is trying to ruin our beloved BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:45:36
I think that stores probably have to run a node to confirm the transaction  
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:35:02
Because they can't controll it. Only way to controll it is making their own crypto currency and try to make everyone go over to theirs.  I'll never switch off from BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:50:09
Hu? They can track their own currency, banks control the rent of a loan, they control everything. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:46:36
Coinbase, super Easy!
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:18:03
I used "Love bitcoin" and the text where it says "bitcoin.org".
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:47:25
Buy bitcoin from coinbase, transfer the money to a hardware wallet like ledger nano or some thing like that! 
Tips: wait till November 7-8th when the fork(s2x) is over! Everyone is pumping in money to bitcoin atm because they want the same volume in b2x!
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:58:57
15 weeks left for me at the moment!
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:25:15
Really hope that they doesn't support the BTG fork when the replay protection is shit... 
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:42:22
Heard of google?
And no, they are not going to accept bitcoin YET ;)
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:36:50
Wow that's crazy :P that's less then my hourly income :O
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:39:29
I like this post! This posts explains why we should take our coins and invest in BTG!
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:50:55
+1 F those people that is trying to lower the price.. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:49:51
"Bank, said cryptocurrency do not go through official channels and cannot be monitored and controlled, thereby posing risks in case it is used to launder money or fund terrorist activities"
That's the point with bitcoins, No interference with the currency. This a typical way to "scare" the people from using bitcoin. In a close future, bitcoin will be illegal. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:18:02
1BTC = ~$100? That's kinda old
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:37:08
You are doing it safe enough. This is a lot safer than the the average BTC holders. I'm buying my BTC from different sites and sending them to other wallets. I'm going to make a cold wallet later this week!
