Any details on your BTC use?
Straight conversion with BitPay?
Save 5%?  10%?

oh okay, thank you for the explanation.
Where are you Zerocoin..

what is revolutionary, I'm not understanding.
You can still see where the BTC went:
what has changed?
0.0008 BTC was sent from 1ELYzQBynuTnkfDn3RcEq74ZUsuTUFdA6h to 13cbkpKW2DdhEUmeGC2h9HyxbBdtc7Wcth, what is Dark about this transaction?

how do stealth addresses help in any way -- how is it any different from creating a random address and informing someone to send money to it?
@_date: 2014-04-28 19:18:21


only if one is holding fiat.  Bitcoin evades.

the scary part is not the government dreaming up this nonsense.

for anyone who wants to periodically see the number of unconfirmed transactions:
    
    
    c=$(curl -s 
    
    re='^[0-9]+$'
    if ! [[ $c =~ $re ]] ; then
      echo -n "nul"
    else
      echo -n $c
    fi

And it's going to stay that way regardless of if we sponsor UFC or ice skating.  People are afraid of what they don't understand.  Get Bitcoin out there, that's what matters.  Crowd funding a UFC fighter is nothing like silkroad, not even close.

DarkWallet isn't much more private than shared-send on blockchain.info (CoinJoin).
We need Zerocoin.

a year is a standard financial measurement.  you can speak in riddles but the math stays the same, Bitcoin has always drastically outperformed the dollar, year over year.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:24:54
they skim off 10% from all the web wallets, and every now and then web wallets disappear.  Needless to say this goes into blockchain.info's personal Bitcoin address.
haha **kidding**, since the blockchain is public this can't happen.
they let gyft advertise on their site
and they do shared send, a mixing service where they take profit

I think this is being over-hyped.  This isn't much more useful than generating a random address.  Someone please prove otherwise.

this is a great idea, tipping small in value (but big? in numbers!) like dogecoin

chromium support only? but..but..tor browser :((
blah quit complaining, great work!
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:25:46
it also plateaued (and growth went negative) in 2011
transaction volume still means nothing in terms of store of value.  transaction volume of gold is not used to determine its "intrinsic value"

I disagree, if the dollar lost its reserve status and began to hyper-inflate Bitcoin would skyrocket in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:37:56
There's still no one who has given a clear answer of why Bitcoin needs a bank
@_date: 2014-05-07 19:22:27
[because]( in the real world energy is a large expenditure and is underweight in the CPI measurement.
When I was in high school less than 10 years ago gas was under $2/gallon.  Now approaching $4/gallon.
Low wage workers devote a significant portion of their paychecks to gasoline due to its expense.
It is in the best interests of the owners of the world reserve currency to make inflation appear as low as possible.
To allow them to also author the official inflation measure is a conflict of interests.

chromium is open source.
But Firefox would be a better choice due to tor browser.

I'm pretty sure it's a bot
@_date: 2014-05-07 20:38:18
but I don't value Barack Obama's brain, therefore it has no intrinsic value, whereas I would value Albert Einstein's brain.
so it still seems subjective.
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:02:33










Is this true?
@_date: 2014-04-30 17:50:33
I disagree, Bitcoin has never had a down year while the dollar has only very rarely had an up year.
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:02:08
I disagree, gold is very dense and heavy, good for crushing skulls. :-}

then those items may be as intrinsically valuable to the aliens as silicon is to us.  still useful, but not essential to support our life.  you've proven a good point, intrinsic value is in the eye of the beholder (or species in this case).  since we have found no aliens though we can assume human :-} -- but no intrinsic value measurement can prove constant throughout the universe?
