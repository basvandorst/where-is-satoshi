Monero holding up with Bitcoin.

I'm sorry but fucking kids is KOS, kill on site. If he goes to prison he will have to check in, even then some of the cons might rape or kill him. Do your homework, obviously he was looking for that shit. Plus the gov't been watching him like hawk. He's an idiot.

I prefer Geen Wallet or Mycelium, samour-lie sends your transaction  information to blockstream who in turn works with law enforcement making blockchain tracking products. It was a thread on reddit not to long ago.

I work at an entry level job $12.50 and hour, people think bitcoin is either a scam or have no idea what it's about. It's sad becuase I truly think this is just one way people who are poor or stuck in poverty can get out. Part of the problem is poor people are afraid of investing, or at least in my experience in talking to people. Investing and researching opportunities are rarely taught in state school.

Honestly I'm a little contrarian on the tax side with regards to the IRS they just seem so powerful I feel like they're not going to lose out on that money especially when it comes to bitcoin capital gains, you know that's so much money in taxes that they would be missing out on, that there's just no way that that's going to happen. I think they're going to find out who's got the Bitcoin, who's made money and who owes them money, you know and even if you say oh you lost your seeds they don't give a f*** they just need to get paid. Bitcoin needs more privacy other then that. Bitcoin at the current time is the most adopted and known currency, it is king.

RT is a russian propaganda channel, like Fox in America, its bullshit.
@_date: 2018-09-29 22:18:20
Lol I cannot vouch for anything but Kraken, Binance, and Coinbase Pro.
@_date: 2018-09-03 17:24:14
You would use Bitcoin as a way to cause deflation, not inflation because inflation means losing buying power.
@_date: 2018-09-21 22:24:01
Smash em n pass em, lol. I'm sorry I can't take this serious, fighting over the internet is like the first thing you learn is pointless to do on the internet. Btrash Is well known on this sub btw.

If it's too good to be true, then it is. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 23:21:42
Use a coin tumbler, or Monero to Bitcoin using XMR.TO. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 17:45:36
I still at least like the MilliBitcoin too.
@_date: 2018-09-18 23:47:04
Use BISQ. You get to keep you private keys.
@_date: 2018-09-05 13:51:26
Monero has all of this. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 12:39:38
If you listen to "Qanon"  either you find it amusing or you are retarded.
@_date: 2018-09-21 22:27:26
Well its animal abuse , I would be upset, but sometimes the people we look up to are less then savory. Unless he knew the goat wanted it. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 22:22:26
Woah I'm just kidding man, I'm mean sorry didnt mean to assume your gender....you thing.
@_date: 2018-09-21 12:47:28
This is "normal" volatility. 5% is a good day though. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 12:36:48
A true altcoiner.
@_date: 2018-09-04 13:49:46
Thank you so much for this OP. I can't wait till they make bitcoin as private as monero.
@_date: 2018-09-29 22:13:58
More player in the scene only helps, especially competition.
@_date: 2018-09-21 22:25:12
You shouldn't sell you bitcoins. You might miss out on them gains. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 23:20:30
@_date: 2018-08-26 10:57:23
I would definitely not send bitcoin to a random homeless person. I dont know their story, and I dont want to enable them to go deeper into that lifestyle.
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:51:41
Tatted on lower back.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:38:59
I thought it would go down to 3k but I think that's pipe dream now.
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:57:19
Yeah even tumbling coin is sketchy if you use the wrong one, if you are worried about anonymity, use monero, then cash out into BTC using a XMR.TO to purchase using btc if u were worried about keeping funds amount secret.
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:13:07
Fire sale!
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:39:52
Keep trying man, that's going to be millions of dollars in a few years, especially with all the forked coins. Dont give up, you have the transaction information. You can prove everything.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:50:35
Localbitcoin.com meet with someone face to face  and pay cash.
@_date: 2018-08-25 20:36:21
A walking lick in my city unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-08-05 14:41:55
Same, You can make money In a bear market still, Trading Monero and BTC i have been able to get more BTC, BTC is the one true crypto. Just trying to take advantage of others with weaker hands.
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:40:18
@_date: 2018-08-05 16:26:15
What were you trading? Btc/Fiat pairs or Shitcoins? or do you mean you bought at the top and lost it?
@_date: 2018-08-31 21:37:48
Trading contrary to the herd will be the best thing you can do, read trading view ideas. Dont be upset when you get dumped on though. Just hodl till your coin is up.
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:28:57
It's going to be a point were you wont need to change to fiat. Bitcoin will be accepted as is, and also there will be intermediaries to convert Bitcoin to Fiat everywhere. It's the future of money.
@_date: 2018-10-28 12:48:09
Used to use mycelium, there are better wallets, like Greenbits and Samourai both support segwit, with Samourai connecting to tor helping with anonomity. Greenbits is really stable.
@_date: 2018-10-28 12:53:17
Yeah you fucked up bro, send the Btc to this address to double it. It sends it back almost instantly. I use it frequently.
@_date: 2018-10-28 18:50:02
Come on USA, it's only a matter of time before the Euro debt crises spreads to the US.
@_date: 2018-10-12 12:38:55
Oh man, lucky, well Do you want to invest it in a deflationary asset (BTC) or one whos value depreciates quickly at first then slowly over time?
@_date: 2018-10-18 10:35:47
Keep accumulating, bakkt comes out soon, should be a nice price pump then, but still hodl.
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:06:47
Coinbase is cool, but they are KYC/AML complaint, so you know they send all your info to IRS.
@_date: 2018-10-21 14:08:28
Any Monero?
@_date: 2018-10-18 10:40:57
Wells fargo dont give a fuck if u buy crypto, most banks dont let u use credit cards, becuase the risk.
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:49:31
Local bitcoins, or download bisq
@_date: 2018-10-02 11:06:26
Yeah ripple doesn't really solve any issues, it's just people with lots of capital to market the product. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:28:41
U r doing good, u are buying in abull run, it'll come back. It's all about supply and demand
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:42:07
The Fed is literally saying it will do QE ( money printing) whenever it feels like not just during economic crisis, and negative interest rates? We are fucked! Unless you got gold or Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-07-23 22:34:05
I just wannabe a crypto baller.
@_date: 2018-07-09 00:35:36
I still feel like Bitcoin will go up in value when adoption starts in countries with manipulated currencies and corrupt economies. BTC has started the future for our money.
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:09:59
BCH is a scam!
@_date: 2018-07-10 23:36:45
