Take out all the "real world" shopping done by visas and those figures wouldn't look so dramatic.
PayPal is an online payment system, not to pay your groceries, which visa also does.

I don't think you know what leaving means.
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:15:55


i got bad news for you.
a shitton of people spend they money because they're told that they *have to*.
@_date: 2017-02-22 23:20:27
Um, society, friends, parents..?!
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:48:55
Yea, the other sub parties hard everytime btc drops because they're all jerking off to everything but actual bitcoin integrity and value.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:29:34
u shillin fam
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:29:13
btc still has a huge edge pp transaction, unless ofc you're trying to send 5$ or shit like this.
i'd take a 1$ fee over a 2.9% +30cent flat fee any given day.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:24:06
All 3 of those btc's that you bet were yours, just not paid for yet.
it's like taking a loan, if you sell your btc + the loan in anticipation of a drop, then the price goes up by 33% you owe the bank the 2 btc, which would require the original "bet" + 66% to buy back.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:39:50
well, down 70$ in a day, especially just a few hours hasnt been too common the past months without an obvious reason.
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:15:58
Lmao you're too funny dude.
How about you go out and get some fresh air into your fucked head? 
Not sure that'd help, but theres a chance i guess.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:51:30
how would this legitimate question even qualify for a shitpost?!
there are no bad news, bitcoin has been pretty steady and we suddenly see a $100 drop within a few hours, raises concerns for sure if theres no explanation behind it.
and i'm sure you have no answer to it as well on your high horse.
@_date: 2017-03-09 00:40:36
whys that unbelievable by any means?
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:49:47
yea ikr?! people praising all the shitty altcoins forget to realize that they hold jack shit in value and btc can actually be used for everyday purchases.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:33:41
paypal takes 2.9% + 0.3$ flat, bitcoin is still WAY cheaper than that with even a flat 1$ fee unless ofc you spend btc on penny purchases.
1000$ purchase becomes 1029.3$ with paypal or 1001$ with btc, obviously still more than viable competition in regards to fees.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:30:11
Only viable to a certain degree, also not viable for any business at all.
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:32:05
lol thats delusional.
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:35:42
No, but thinking that btc will rise to ~2200$ over night is nothing but  fucking delusional.

@_date: 2017-03-17 11:12:07
well i don't care if the confirmation takes 30 minutes when i purchase something online for example.
also the fees are lower than pp, i dont get all the bitching about it just because you were spoiled early on.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:10:24
Everywhere is used to refer to countries in this case. So literally every devoted country is using it. 
What's your next argument trying to convince me that I don't know the meaning of a word? Or are you just going to trying to annoyingly piggyback on the " I literally don't think you know what literally means" bullshit meme? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:11:42
Why wouldn't i post on this sub? Give me **any** logical reason why I shouldn't feel free to post here.
And the question can go right back at you, who the fuck are you? his dad? why bother throwing shit at some random stranger?!
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:51:48
I hate this sub for exactly the kind of people you replied to. everyone here thinks they're tough shit that are somehow important.
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:11:15
i legit dont get all the bitching at high fees. paypal has way higher fees than btc and is literally used everywhere.

@_date: 2017-03-17 14:32:18
Are there any non third world countrys that i'm not aware of that don't use paypal?

bruh he's got 1.7 btc... why would anyone go through hardware wallet trouble for that amount.
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:00:34
Yea, thats how markets work, next week can and will possibly look different again ;)
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:53:45


I did, they all suck.
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:04:42
how would you know, any why do you even care?! how's that even relevant to his question at all?
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:25:49
you didn't miss it. you decided against it.
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:43:19
your logic should tell you that its fake. 80k btc moving would have an impact. can't see any.
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:41:39
or ya know, explain?!
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:16:47
sub 900 now, whats the reasoning, mighty wizzard?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:18:37
i couldve been a super early adopter. my wow guild talked about bitcoin all day when it was below 1$, i told them that they're retarded and btc will be merely a cent in the long run..
oh boy was i wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:18:48
bought in too late eh?
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:36:53
Ugh, as you said, dude is *just* 16.
1200 when you're 16 is completely different money to when you're 26, couldn't care less about 1.2 at this point in time, back when i was 16 that wouldve been a fat stack of money for me.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:16:01
sub 900 10 minutes later.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:49:59
Thank god i'm not american, because keeping the data for so many years is straight up illegal and unusable in court here in the EU :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:13:04
Uh how would they know about the money if its hidden ..
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:17:48
Put down those pink shades.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:22:18
What history? He said he got the BTC before their marriage.
Do you really think theres gonna be a browser history years back?
Also a subpoena like that would need to be based on actual indicators, you can't just demand the court to lay open the entire financial history.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:16:51
Or ya know, tell a half lie instead of keeping it up full.
If he really wants to support her education for whatever reason and put up with years of her contributing no cent to the household expenses he may as well tell her some crap like " hey i found this old harddrive with 40 bitcoins on it, we're good to take the next step now".
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:17:45


If you sell on OP you'd get less than that. ~3200-3300.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:50:57
If you need 10 years to accumulate 70k i've bad news for you.
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:41:33
pay more than 0.25% fees next time.
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:56:51
Wheres the article about this?
Ebay full on accepting BTC like they're doing with paypal ( coverage etc ) seems absurd to me.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:56:25
He paid 50cents fees on a $200 transaction. pretty sure my math is correct and that it is in fact 0.25%.
After re-reading i understand your point tho, you probably thought i wanted to aim at a $2 fee.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:23:48
I'm sure there are enough people out there who would survive that just fine, given enough funding.
And coinbase definitely has more than enough funding.
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:44:28


Uh, no one?! You can relinquish any inheritance.
@_date: 2017-05-13 01:01:15
I know that, i just thought OP was one of those " hurr durr transaction fees" whiners so i pointed out that what he spent was merely 0.25% of the total.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:07:32
Bitcoin takes seconds to process if you pay a proper fee.
Paypal has 90% market share for online retailers, yet their fees are absurd.
It's working, don't overexaggerate.
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:07:26
This wasnt a small jump tho.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:20:22
Yea, because you cheapskated a 200$ transaction, then complained about bitcoin being useless for everyday purchases, while that clearly isn't the case at all.
Pay proper fees, get proper results.
And the fees of PP which is getting used majorly in everyday purchases is completely apeshit in comparison to BTC fees, yes.
And the general consent on this sub is that the BTC fees are donkeyballs.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:48:23
Need some tissues?
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:18:52
Because there were literally no news supporting the bull rush, it was a completely random bubble caused by whatever - nothing that would back it up at with any reasoning at least.
and a 900$ increase within 3 days is completely unhealthy without any news supporting this, was bound to happen, it happened.
Why do i have to explain my thinking to you now tho? you were the one claiming to have the crystalball mind - so what was your reasoning?
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:49:28
Why would it be required to put savings into btc to voice your opionion? are you retarded?
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:38:42
Never said it's anything else.
I answered your question, no reason to downvote and get all cunty over it ;)
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:10:43
Solid and sound reasoning!
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:00:27


@_date: 2017-05-04 23:03:45


If he disappears *with* his bitcoin going into nowhere.
If he disappears *after* disposing all of his coins we'll be down for quieeeeeete a long time.
That asshole is holding so many coins that he could ruin it for all of us, thats exactly why he's so dangerous.
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:30:18
Lol they do, theres no way they can legally pursue you if you reliqnuish your inheritance.
You guys need to step up your law game.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:14:38
We're talking about sendin / receiving money here, no? Why would you bring in amazon sales fees now? thats completely irrelevant.
If you privately sold a $1000 item through BTC you'd be at like 1$ fees, if you sold that through PP you'd have to eat $30-$40 fees.
@_date: 2017-05-13 01:26:51
You're everywhere!
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:44:41
Where are you from?
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:47:02
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:13:38
I just realized how dumb you are, thinking you'd need hundreds of thousands BTC to manipulate the market.
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:47:06
could range from $10000 to $100000 invested 5 years go.
if you're frugal af living in nowhere you'd be set with 10k, if you're living somewhere decent and want to actually live your life you'd need quite a bit more.
All those "man i'm so happy i turned $2000 into $15000 and don't have to do jack shit anymore" people are delusional.
Sure, thats a decent bit of money for some people, but nothing life changing, no matter where you live ( assuming first world country here ).
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:41:09
What? What exactly should i be mad about?
BTC aren't at 900-1100, so listening to your advice wouldv been as useless as reading the bs thats coming from you.
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:07:25
Ya know whats also nice? Buying the house with your SO, which you for about 99.99% didnt have at that time, who the heck would date a 27yo man living with his parents.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:49:45
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:08:45
Ofc you're still delusional, your pricepoint is still 50% of what the current rate is.
You're stupid to even come in thinking you predicted something correctly now when infact its still double of the worth you predicted lmfao

Paypal has a flat fee of 1.9% AND 30cents per transaction.
How is that NOT absurd?
Especially in comparison to BTC fees.

Gyazo always worked fine on mobile.
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:41:53

He probably paid more tax money by now than you will do your entire life.
I'd call that contributing.

Not really, given the fact that both seem to be an all-in, thats always a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:36:07


the huge selloff happened within ~1-2 minutes, making it go down from close to 2.7 to 2490 lowest
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:06:55
coinbase has no 10$ fee wtf are you talking about? it's neither 1% just checked my ydays transactiong, several 1k+ transactions with a maximum of 1.2$ in fees.
Mind you, the fees are high enough to have verifications in seconds, so it's worth it to me.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:14:54
What are you planning to pay for that fees are such a huge problem for you?
Unless btc gets some absurd fees like paypal i'm completely fine with that.
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:40:08
That sticky would be stupid, because no one knows when its an ath beforehand.
Do you legit believe anyone would willingly invest right at the ath?! bruh pls
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:14:59
It was more than obvious that btc will be dropping after such a bullrush tho, not like you're some kind of mastermind.
your 900-1100 is still absurd.
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:45:58
i always pay around 80cent in transaction fees and get it through within seconds.
aint nobody got time to wait for hours / days.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:37:42


@_date: 2017-05-13 00:16:04

Seems it is indeed worse.

@_date: 2017-05-04 23:10:46
You're probably what 90% of this sub makes up.
People who don't even hold a single coin but voice their opinion which is hugely irrelevant because they have merely anything to lose or to gain.
I'v got the feeling that he majority of the *HODL* guys don't hold much more than a single coin, if at all.
People with hundreds of coins for whatever purpose ( i guess mostly trading ) are the ones who are quiet and dont shout any nonsense into any price change.
TL:DR: majority of the vocals here hold jack shit.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:46:18
And i stand by that.
If your bitcoin were nothing but speculative they would be nowhere by now.
Remember the pizza guy? He's one of the reasons bitcoins took off, if no business would ever accept bitcoin as a payment it would literally hold nothing but speculative value, all you'd have is a coin that some other private people would be willing to trade for fiat.
The way bitcoin is right now you have actual real world value that you can use whenever needed for whatever is needed right now.
Without big companys accepting bitcoin we wouldn't be nearing 3000, we wouldn't even be close to it.
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:12:52
Yes, because that $10.000 purse will fund other things as well.
Let alone the fact that tax money is mandatory for the greater good of the entire country and its population.
Whate are you? Some kinda artist living on welfare who thinks he contributes with his art in some meaningful spiritual way?
How can't you grasp the concept of taxmoney contributing to society?! Thats legit beyond me.
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:51:27
Ugh why wouldn't they?!
If everyone was like you " hoard, don't do jack shit with it " btc would be nowhere, because technically it would have nothing but speculative value.
The fact that businesses accept BTC and customers are paying with BTC has given it the value that it has.
@_date: 2017-07-07 13:15:43
Implying you know that such thing is even an option, let alone enabled by default.
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:36:54

pm me as well pls
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:44:09
yea, obviously thats bs. but how do you pay below 1$ in fees?
would come in handy for lower transactions, i ditch every &lt;~2k transaction lately because of the fees adding so much percentage wise.
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:14:47
 
tried another, worked just fine...
wtf is going on

I'm paying 2-3$ fees on my transactions.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:20:38
They're not "allowing" withdrawals for the customers safety, who knows how fucking long, if at all stuff will send right after the fork.
Better to have it "frozen" for a day or two instead of ripping your entire transactions into nowhere.
