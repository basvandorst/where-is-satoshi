what if they short, and the price keeps inching up.. then they get a margin call.   It would be really risky to short this sort of asset.  but yes anything can happen.

it would be more profitable if they could drive the price up just before they short the heck out of it.... but like price has already come down quite a bit.  selling a large position now, isnt going to net them as much as selling a large position when it is at like 20K.

ditto... my thoughts also.  more risk to short now than when at 17k.  and not as much profit potential if they try to short.  hell, then why not just go long.

tell me more about this btc visa plz
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:46:29
today the ability to short bitcoin is not there.   once the futures markets open up, the instituitional investors will have the ability to put in huge short positions.  Look at how gold and silver is manipulated today... i'm mixed about this.
