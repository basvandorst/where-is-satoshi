Is it not possible to change the address on them?

I paid $150 for my dog because he was in a foster rescue type place and we got a year free checkups. I haven't seen a dog in a pet store that was cheaper than $500. Don't shop, adopt.

Any sane person would use a Cashiers Check or something similar in that situation. Far less risk involved. No person in their right mind would carry any large amount around in cash.

Do you know how Cashiers Checks work? Your money stays at the bank until the check clears and then goes to whoever cashed the check. You don't physically move any money. Unless you are a crazy person and just keep it all shoved under your mattress, in which case you would have to physically move it, yes.

From what I have read, the best thing to do is to keep your money in a wallet. Your wallet key will be valid on both chains after the fork, so you can take your coins later and put them into the wallet then need to go into.

Flip a coin.

I live in farm country so if someone breaks into my house it will be some teenager looking for easy grabs like jewlery, cash, etc. They might see our safe and hit it a few times, but they aren't going to bust out a torch and hope that it is worth it.

Not significantly more than the lost coins found today? Hmm? I am referring to brute forcing your wallet passwords with a quantum computer since they will be able to do thousands of times more calculations in a second than we currently can. I am not referring to mining coins. What takes years now would take seconds for a quantum computer. 
So if someone lost the pass phrase for a wallet with 5 BTC in it they cannot feasibly brute force the code today because it would take many centuries worth of tries. A quantum computer could do that in hours or days.

Blockfolio doesn't allow me to put in commissions on trades.

Ok. I didn't see anywhere on their site that it says it, so I just wanted to verify before I put another $50 in. When did you do it? How long did it take to get the $10?
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:37:27
Is that only if you used a referral or anyone? I didn't use a referral code, so I didn't think I would receive a free $10.

I think they mean just wait for the next correction and hope it goes back up from there. Of course you can't predict with certainty that it will go back up, but if you buy at the bottom of a correction, or what you think is the bottom, if it goes back up you make money.

Not millions, but possibly enough to buy a car.

I know that you can buy and sell on GDAX for cheap/free, but do you still have to do the initial buy through Coinbase in order to get money into the system?
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:11:43
I have been locked out for 24 hours trying, but I finally figured out on Coinbase's website there is an option for an image upload so you can use a camera that actually focuses on your ID.

As a corollary, I wonder how many lost coins could be found again if/when quantum computing takes off.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:14:36
I did the exact same thing yesterday. I bought $25 of Bitcoin and Litecoin for the first time!
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:15:43
No problem. I appreciate the input. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:12:09
Maybe the guy lives in some swanky neighborhood with multi-millionaires so they are a higher target? IDK.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:50:06
Or buy one you can just bolt to the floor?
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:46:19
Correct. If/when they take off most encryption we have today would be useless. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:49:28
Was that $100 that you paid total, meaning $100 paid and $96 of bitcoin after fees or $100 of bitcoin? How long ago did you do this?
Also thank you for answering all the questions.
