Mustapha Cole from SLLG is doing some fantastic work. We are supporting SLLG on our non-profit platform to make it easier for them to convert the Bitcoins to Leones - bitcoinagainstebola.org

Hey, totally understand your concern here. 
Bitcoin Against Ebola is a non-profit initiative by us - [Beam]( We accept Bitcoins via GoCoin and convert them to Splash mobile money in Sierra Leone. We have been fully KYC-ed and verified by both organisations. 
We are also supported and funded by a well know incubator in Ghana ([MEST]( that has been around for over 5 years and has had several companies and mentions on top tech blogs. In fact, they [just tweeted]( about us. 
We also have well-know people on our board like [ and [ who can confirm their involvement in our company.
Lastly, we are have had a couple of articles written about us on [Coindesk]( and [Cointelegraph]( We are working on bringing some bigger names in the Bitcoin world on-board to support us.
We are a **brand new** company so we are working on this everyday. Looking forward to suggestions on what you think will provide more legitimacy to our cause.

Hey! You can either send money to one of the two charities we are supporting: [LunchBoxGift]( or [SLLG]( Or you can send money to an individual who you know in Sierra Leone.
You can view all this information on our landing page (bitcoinagainstebola.org) under the "Who will receive your money?" section.
