hard to say, depends on ATM setup. 5 minutes is less then block time, I would assume that ATM is waiting for transaction for 5 minutes to detect it in mempool and than waits for confirmation(s) to give you the cash, again, depends on ATM - I think you should be fine.
P.S. Bitpay is not the wise choice of your wallet.

It is easier and safer just to buy some BTC (DCA would be the one way to consider) and hold it. Almost all cloud mining offers are a scam, especially the ones with lifetime contracts.
Not your keys - not your coins.

1 USD currently is ~0.1 mBTC
If one of the exchanges introduced $-mBTC pair, it would already look reasonable.

It would be much more helpful to post what the actual problem is.

asking on bitcoin sub, what do you expect? )

depends how much time does ATM provide to deposit funds and how fast bitstamp sends withdrawn BTC.
I would install Samourai, then: Bitstamp&gt;Samourai&gt;ATM
bump up the fee in Samourai depending on ATM deposit time window

s@ looks pretty easy to use )
Waiting for the time when we will be talking about prices in s rather then 0...x BTC.

Less block reward means less payment to miners from coinbase and more incentive to include as many transactions in a block as possible to get more BTC.

p.s. before sending the assets to your hardware device, send a minimum amount which you can afford to lose, reset the hardware wallet and try to recover with your seed. If after recovery is done your funds are there - you are good to go.
If you have not tested your seed - you don't have a seed.

F$ck that $hitpay service. The more countries they leave - the better. There are way better alternatives and merchants should switch to them.

Learn how to use tools available to keep your assets secure.
Trezor/Ledger is a good way to go, but if you keep your seed online (computer text file, Google drive etc.) hardware wallet does not help much. Also learn how to compare update file's signature to the ones posted by developers to make sure you are not getting scammed/phished. Do not ever save your seed somewhere where it's accessible by anyone else except of you.
