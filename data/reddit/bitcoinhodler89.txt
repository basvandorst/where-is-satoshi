And x4

What makes bitcoin premium over litecoin which could complete the same job? The only difference is brand recognition which is slowly being tarnished each and every day transactions cost a fortune. If people can't afford bitcoin how do you plan to get more people using it and increasing the value of it since more want it?
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:25:40
Gimmick of free coins? That’s part of a hard fork
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:08:09
And when will we get the LN?
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:10:32
Right ok, and? There's no transaction backlog either. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:48:06
There's no such thing as spam. How do you get to decide what is or isn't a valid transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:12:39
Why are lightning solutions not ready now? They've had so much time to prepare. Why can't the blocksize be increased until lightning is ready?
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:07:54
well that makes sense...
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:03:21
But you'll be paying an insane amount, no?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:05:51
You do? Your limit is now 2MB max... Bitcoin Cash is capable of 8MB... Try again 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:49:57
How much has it made from trading?
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:41:08
Why would anyone support smaller blocks. Smh
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:23:48
Lol ok... But then if you're paid in BTC and you make 0.2 BTC a week I don't think you'll be using BTC. You'll spend 0.01 or 0.001 in fees?
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:06:42
Not really. That lasted for a day or two. Then they moved back. Now Cash has reduced difficulty again so they are moving back to Cash. The transaction backlog has been large even before Cash existed. It is an issue of block size. Miners moving doesn't help but the biggest issue is being limited by how many transactions fit in a block. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:06:15
So why bother buying Bitcoin then?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:55:49
Ok so they code out of the goodness of their hearts?
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:54:20
Not silence lol
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:42:39
ok... They get paid by me when I and other invest in BTC 
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:33:26
Doesn't have to be this steep.... Come on man...
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:53:03
Aren't there more Ethereum nodes than Bitcoin nodes? 
Ethereum chain takes wayyyy longer than Bitcoin... So hows that work?
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:10:49
Ok... But in order to get BTC you have to pay dollars... It's all relative and there is no escaping that as that's what people are currently paid in and what the price of goods in BTC is based on. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:45:34
Why didn't you get yours?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:33:59
Looks like he is. Not me. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:40:33
So far the best bet was to move it into BCH to triple your money. Whether that is the case long term is another story. It may very well be, no one truly knows. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:30:52
How do you promise a solution though and not have it worked out? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:11:07
So by mining a few empty blocks they're ruining bitcoin and causing the high fees?
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:26:04
What's the speculation about? The hopes it will replace the world's money? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:05:07
if blocksize is the issue some think it is then they’ll have to be worried about 4x as many blocks 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:42:26
So they buy simply because others did. Great
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:31:47
Mine a Bitcoin manually LOL
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:10:15
I really don't see how raising the blocksize is a bad idea. In the short term miners would make less on fees and have less control. Ethereums blockchain is massive and yet they have more nodes than Bitcoin apparently
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:58:37
Huh? Miners are moving back and forth based on difficulties 
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:32:14
Yes it is
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:35:14
I’ve seen the cost thing before but why does everyone have to run a node? Why not enthusiasts and nerds. Of which storage is fairly cheap?
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:09:56
Andreas always says there's no such thing as spam. If someone is willing to pay a fee, how can we say what is or isn't a valid transaction? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:46:04
You change one number in the code essentially... What good development practices are required?
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:18:56
Trump won. Sorry for your feelings. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:10:03
Which is a shame when we could be capable of larger blocks
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:27:52
Trump won... 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:14:28
Don't bother.... 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:53:37
Part of the problem is that most wallets suggest fees isn’t it? If users set manual fees I think on both chains, BTC and BCH perhaps the fee average would be lower. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:07:10
Why can't technologies be built on bigger blocks as well? Why are we trying to solve for a problem years and years away when we can accommodate transaction volume now with block size on chain?
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:47:06
What’s madness about it?
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:58:00
Ok... So then the value will likely decrease since demand won't be high. So you're now left with nothing.  How does that work as a store of value?
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:08:36
Definitely wouldn't be free. There will be some cost to it
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:04:40
Well that's silly... This graph wouldn't show transactions on an exchange. 
Also, transactions on an exchange are centralised... Not to mention not even real bitcoin necessarily... Simply accounting numbers if the exchange isn't solvent. It's no different from banks we have today. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:47:03
What's that picture?
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:06:09
Ok. And tulips? If bitcoins fees remain out of this world then why would more people buy and why would others tell people about Bitcoin. What is the selling point when it costs $10 a transaction 
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:10:10
a private bank... That's not worthwhile with high fees
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:24:10
case in point that BTC is currently non-functional, yes. People are waking up 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:04:06
Why's it an alt coin? If it ever gets longest chain difficulty it becomes Bitcoin. What will you do then?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:37:05
Sorry.. I can't code. Trying to help by helping to see this fee madness and small blocks give an overall net negative for Bitcoin and it's adoption. 6 months is a LONG time in the crypto space. The last time fees skyrocketed and the mempool increased Bitcoins dominance dropped from 80% to under 50%
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:18:32
And we are supposed to live with the fees we have now until then? Like why wasn't this ready after Segwit has been locked in for awhile now and LN has existed for some time as well? We need a scaling solution sooner than later....
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:21:14
Well of course, it has less adoption currently. If all the transactions on Bitcoin took place on Bitcoin Cash then they'd have more 8MB blocks and almost no mempool. Transactions confirmed after 1 block...
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:37:13
Has nothing to do with amount of $... Bitcoin is capable of the same if there's no transaction backlog... Of which there is right now. Segwit plus a blocksize increase is clearly the best option. Sigh
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:30:48
Oh but I was told smaller blocks were a fight against the miners and that it was miners who want bigger blocks?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:41:34
How is a legit concern fud?
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:14:37
lol actually yes there was 
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:03:30
Bu..Bu..But a block &gt;1MB was mined!
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:13:19
Makes sense... If transaction fees weren't as much as some people make in day?
