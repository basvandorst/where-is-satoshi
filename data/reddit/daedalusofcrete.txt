You know that a Satoshi is Bitcoin, right? What you're doing is contributing to a network of people who are all mining Bitcoin, and you're getting some fractional reward based on your contribution.
There's an excellent chance that you're burning more kWh than you're getting back in Satoshi.
The mining calculators will be accurate for what you're doing.

When you set up your Electrum two-factor authentication (2FA), you were given some kind of code to put into Google Authenticator, which allows your phone and computer to generate the same key at the same time.
If you've lost that original code, you should disable 2FA on Electrum, then reenable it to get a new code. Write that code down. If you get a new phone, all you have to do is install Google Authenticator and input that code to continue generating correct 2FA keys.

You... need to do more research. None of what you just said is accurate.

Ok, but Walmart doesn't sell BTC. You'll have to make some conversions before you get to BTC. Cash, Visa gift card, PayPal...

No. Those are 0.01BTC coffees. Always.

I like that this conversation is between Kevin and James.

Hey, I'm not not in.
I'd be interested in seeing a much broader statement about blockchain, fiat currency, and store-of-value.
I assume most of us see utility in more than just BTC.

Either my math is wrong or I'm reading this wrong.
As I understand it, and pretending for a moment that this was a live market with a person, Bob, holding some Bitcoin:
OP borrowed 98 Bitcoins from Bob, promising to pay them back (probably with some interest). OP then immediately sold those 98 Bitcoins for cash at $51.28, giving him $5025.44.
OP did whatever he did with the money, but he still owes Bob 98 Bitcoins (and maybe some interest). In the meantime, the dollar value of one Bitcoin rose to $5132.55.
OP sold all of his Bitcoin, so in order for him to pay Bob back his 98 Bitcoins, OP will have to buy more Bitcoin on the open market. This will cost him $502,989.90.
Where's the other $49.5 million?

Well, if you sold someone a copy of a key to your house, and on the honor system never stepped foot in that house again, would that constitute a sale of your house?

First deposit on 10/15, the rest are all today.
What are the chances that whoever made the Facebook post just handed this dude a sign with a new wallet address on it?

Hypothetically, you should be able to plug your public wallet key into a block explorer, like  and you should be able to see the current amount of coin and every transaction associated with that block. So if there was a transaction that you don't know about, it should show there.
Of course, Breadwallet might be using a private database to accept coin and storing it somewhere on the block chain that you can't actually see. Like an "escrow account". I'm not familiar with their structure.

A modern day Martin Luther!
Except that it's a flash mob.
And Martin Luther didn't actually storm up to the church and nail his "list of demands" on the door.
But otherwise!!
