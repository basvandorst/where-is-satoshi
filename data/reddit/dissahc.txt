indeed, he says it as if he saw bitcoin coming or something. highly doubt that.
@_date: 2014-03-07 09:33:28
That's all beside the point that it would be pointless. Satoshi hasn't touched his coins to date, that effectively renders them out of circulation. Only if he suddenly and rapidly started exchanging his BTC for some other currency would the price be significantly effected.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:45:08
Yeah, look at where the alleged prize money came from -- a known internet troll who is part of a known trolling organization (GNAA). Hmm...
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:57:45
well to be perfectly honest, this isn't a very useful test. how secure your wallet is obviously depends on 
* the length of the password
* the complexity of the password
* the amount of resources dedicated to cracking it
in this situation, you are compromising all three of these -- effectively putting yourself in an unrealistic scenario.
if you were curious about the security of your passphrase, it's not difficult to calculate the keyspace for your passphrase, how long it would take to crack, etc. a deterministic wallet with sufficient entropy (see: blockchain.info) is perfectly secure -- the length and complexity is sufficient, the only weak spot would be if enough people tried to crack it. and again, this is inherent to all wallets, only slightly more so with highly entropic deterministic wallets.
anyway, i don't mean to tell you this is all for nothing, just that these challenges serve better as entertainment than some sort of measure of security. and it's no fun if it takes more money in electricity than the reward to crack it.

is the phrase capitalised at the beginning? or punctuated with a period at the end?




@_date: 2014-03-08 13:46:36
i think it's fair to tell us how it's capitalised... otherwise there are many variations in capitalisation for each phrase. is the first word capitalised and is there a period at the end?
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:25:28
so basically, no.

to elaborate, they generate massive rainbow tables of pub + priv key pairs. then they monitor recently blockchain transactions, checking each bitcoin address against the rainbow table.
don't believe me? make a brain wallet with a few dollars in it. set the passphrase to three, four words max.
i made a wallet with the passphrase "i am gay", the funds were 'automatically' transferred out within 8 seconds.

why are you so desperate for weed?
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:13:30
by overhead i mean all of it, images, html, and the http protocol itself.
a typical http request header is probably around 750 to 1000 bytes. if mtgox were to use a custom protocol, this could be reduced by a factor of 20 or more. and that's not even factoring in the html, images, etc.
you're right though, ajax+rest/json would drastically reduce the html+image data, but the http overhead is still present.

hash is a noun too, it refers to the product of a checksum algorithm.
also, hashing has little to do with public key cryptography. they work in very different ways.
anyway, regarding op's idea... i fail to see why you would want this? what's the big appeal of having a string of hexadecimal characters on a rolling paper?

@_date: 2013-04-17 19:39:43
then it's odd that you'd be worried about transaction fees, huh?
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:58:51


is not a solution. you can't simply filter out a ddos -- a router somewhere has to process those incoming packets and drop them. generally, the further upstream this happens, the better.
my proposed solution is developing an mtgox trading application that doesn't rely on the web browser, as http has huge overhead. if mtgox were to release a lightweight client built around a lightweight protocol, the load would be very significantly reduced.
another option is to trade over tor, or a similar, specialised technology. this way their ip address will never be disclosed.
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:49:46
please don't take offense but... google is a programmer's best friend. if you were to google "how can i accept bitcoin on my website", you'd get the exact same answers as here.

waste the fees? you have 100btc dude, fees are as like 0.0001, and that'll get you confirmed within 10-15 minutes.
why don't you send me some amount of bitcoins, and i'll send you back half? trust goes both ways ;)
edit: by the way, 6 confirmations? even with 1 confirmation, the chances of it being a double spend are very, very, extremely low.

there are a few bitcoin payment processors you could use, such as bitpay and bitwallet. you would have to use their api to anticipate payment then vend the musical purchase.
i've never used them before, but i think they can accomplish what you're asking.
otherwise, i can write you some code to do this without relying on a 3rd party payment processor, who might want a cut. pm me if you're interested -- the task is relatively small and my rates are reasonable :)

this is a trust-based p2p trading platform which takes place on irc.
once you get your account set up, you can buy bitcoins directly from sellers.
i'm not sure what type of money transfer options are available to you locally, but many transactions are via moneypak (funded @ walmart, transferred online) or bank transfer (if you're at the same bank, it should be pretty quick)
or here in canada, we have a nifty thing called EMT/interac e-transfer, which takes about 30 minutes, and is non-reversible
once you gain sufficient trust ratings, some people may even sell you bitcoins for paypal. 
*edit:* EMT/interac e-transfers ARE reversible, albeit less so than paypal or credit card. if you are paid with fraudulent/stolen funds, there is a chance the transaction will be reversed.
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:09:27
you didn't specify what the trend term was? "bitcoin" ?
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:21:45
SHA256 is a hashing algorithm, not an encryption. This means that for every SHA256 hash, there is an infinite amount of input variations that can produce the same hash. This is called a collision. The only protection we have against collisions is the computational impracticality of producing them.
Since it's entirely possible (albeit improbable) that a different input could produce the same hash, it would be unwise to exclude the checksum process.
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:16:52
it is actually trivial to differentiate ddos attacks from legitimate traffic. most ddos attacks take place via udp -- no legitimate mtgox user will be sending udp packets. in the case of http ddos (very unusual and relatively ineffective), you can just look for unusually high http requests. filtering out ips attached to users who are logged in narrows it down further.
that said, op's idea in theory could work but is wholly unprofessional and unfeasible. not to mention probably illegal.

@_date: 2013-04-13 10:43:48
yeah, terrible explanation. i don't think he understands bitcoin that well, either. one of the most important parts of bitcoin is the cryptography... after all, it is a cryptocurrency.
he should've planned a good analogy beforehand. i'll give it a shot:
the network as a whole gives out math homework to the miners. they complete the homework, which is a process where computational power has a positive correlation with time spent -- this prevents bitcoins from being created out of thin air. at the same time, the equations they solve in their math homework helps verify the validity of transactions within the bitcoin network. essentially, the people making transactions pay a very small fee to the miners, who proofread their homework (AKA transaction summaries) and therefore uphold the integrity of the whole system. transaction summaries are organized into blocks, which the miners try to solve. this is a brute force process, meaning you must keep trying different solutions until you get it right. it is also somewhat random, as you're basically guessing the solution. however, think of your attempts to solve the block as lottery tickets -- the more tickets you can submit, the higher the chance is that you will win. this process of mining is how new coins are introduced to the system. the bitcoin network periodically halves the amount of bitcoins given to miners to account for market growth and increasing processing power in computers.

what's the exact wallet address you sent it from?
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:05:09
wrong. the seller would just generate a new bitcoin address, then give it to the buyer. once payment is received, the item can be shipped.
edit: also, bitcoin is anonymous, just not private. for example, you put a ski mask on and masturbate in the street. you'll be anonymous (your identity will be obscured), but everybody will still see what you're doing.
