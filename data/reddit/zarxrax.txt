Yea, problem is not everyone needs the FASTEST transaction. If a wallet lets you choose between multiple settings, the low fee setting should not still be designed to give you the fastest transaction.

It's not the lazy who are being priced out, it's everyone. This wouldn't have been a problem if segwit had been a hard fork and been mandatory. Instead core wanted to keep it optional. It can't be optional and then everyone complain that it's not being used! If everyone is supposed to be using it, it should have been mandatory.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:16:23
The whole point of bitcoin is that its supposed to work even when people are behaving poorly. If bitcoin is failing because people are spamming, or because they don't want to adopt segwit or whatever, this is a FLAW IN BITCOIN, not a problem with the world around it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:40:20
Yea man, just like the past couple of days everyone was passing around the charts showing that bitcoin is going to go up yesterday due to bankers getting their bonuses. I guess this makes just as much sense.

It still takes time to develop and test layer 2 solutions. It isn't going to just magically start working because fees are high.

Well, for services to implement segwit, they have to actually do work and make changes to their systems. Depending on how their systems are set up, it could potentially be very expensive or time consuming for them. 
If you are old enough to remember the y2k scare of the late 90s, that seemed like such a trivial thing, computers just needed to support longer dates... But companies spent huge amounts of resources towards getting things upgraded, because often what seems like a trivial fix isn't as easy as it appears.

I've been meaning to transfer some money to a paper wallet as a christmas gift. This thread encouraged me to go ahead and do the transaction. Fee was 17.124 sat/B ($0.49) and got confirmed in the first block. 4 confirmations within 15 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:16:34
most wallets support a recovery phrase, which is a list of words that you can use to recover your wallet from another device. You just need to make sure that phrase is stored somewhere securely, generally on a piece of paper.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:05:20
Is this saying that we have over 100,000 nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:59:58
Serious question: how can someone in an impoverished country afford to pay the bitcoin transaction fees? When you need to buy food every day to live on, just "storing" your wealth isn't an option.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:49:27
This is very interesting. But could you elaborate on this a bit, as I am having some difficulty understanding. Are you saying that if recipients of payments run their own nodes, that this would alleviate some of the congestion on the network, or are you saying that this is needed more from a decentralization standpoint? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:59:04
I just prepared a bitcoin wallet as a Christmas gift for someone less than a week ago. I spent under 50 cents for the transaction fee and it was confirmed in the first block. Sure, things have gotten worse over the week, but you still don't have to pay some ridiculous $20 fee. First of all you should be sending from a segwit wallet, as your fees will be lower. Second of all, since you have until Christmas, there is no need to get the transactions confirmed in a timely manner, so you can easily use lower fees that will take longer to confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:50

What does this BIP actually accomplish? Isn't this sort of like saying the US should use the metric system? The problem is how do you get people to actually use it? What's going to get exchanges to switch? Wallets? Tv commentators and news articles? I don't see how we can get people to start using bits any more than Ver can get people to stop saying bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:18:55
LOL, so the high fees now are great because the miners still need to get paid 100 years from now?

If they sign up for their own coinbase accounts, you can transfer to them on coinbase for free.

Yea, such a horrible inside deal that they announced four months ago. No one could have seen it coming!
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:23:45
One way is if you download a wallet that is compromised itself. There are also lots of viruses and malware that can try to grab your private keys. Phishing is a big one too. Lots of fake sites have urls similar to real sites, and frequently even have ads that show up on google when you search for the real site. There are even viruses that will check your clipboard for bitcoin addresses, and then when you paste, it will paste a different address--so when you send a payment to someone it actually sends to the attackers address.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:45:13
Many were "conned" you say? As in they actually bought bch at $9000? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:20:15
I highly doubt they are putting any transactions on the network. My expectation is that these cards transact off chain.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:08:30
Yea, screw coinbase for following through on a promise that they made several months ago when this whole sub was attacking them for "keeping" their bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:03:30
That's a pretty good way of doing it. You have a "cold wallet" for long term safe storage, and a "hot wallet" for easy access. There are plenty of solid digital wallets available, just find one that seems pretty popular, and don't put more funds into it than you would be willing to lose if something were to happen. If you want to keep funds available for trading on an exchange, you might want to keep a small amount on the exchange itself. Again, not more than you are willing to lose, and really just for the convenience of being able to make quick and easy trades if you want to.
On android, I personally use Coinomi, because it lets me store a bunch of different coins. If I'm ever out and about and someone wants to send me some Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash, the one wallet can handle it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:29:59
Probably just dumb criminals and saw some news article about how bitcoin is anonymous and used for illicit activities.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:48:56
A few minutes of googling reveals the answer.
 The readme of the bitcoin.com wallet reveals that the wallet is a fork from the copay wallet: 
A closed issue on the copay wallet reveals that the network connection is required when generating the wallet because it uses the Bitcore-wallet-service to connect to the blockchain and other copayers: 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:31:18
3 days is a long time. No one knows what the fees are going to look like until we actually get there.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:03:15
I've been looking into setting up a node using blockstream's satellite service, since it won't use any bandwidth and it just sounds amazingly cool. Does anyone know if you can download the FULL blockchain via satellite, or does it only steam the most recent part?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:34:38
And now they have an actually working implementation of it. Sounds like they have made some progress.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:54:56
Because no one is using bch and ltc. Bch literally has 1/10 of the transactions going through it that bitcoin has.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:39:21
One thing that I worry about is that I believe there AREN'T a lot of smaller transactions on the bitcoin blockchain right now, so lightning wont take any of the load off. So while people will finally actually be able to do small transactions thanks to lightning, I feel like the main blockchain is still going to be clogged with high-fee transactions. It would possibly even get worse because the people opening and closing channels to get onto lightning will be "additional" transactions that aren't even present right now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:17:16
This is right on the money. Lightning network alone isn't going to solve the scaling problems. In the past 1-2 months we have watched bitcoin lose nearly all of its actual utility. 
Prominent core developers like and others need to step up and communicate about scaling solutions in order to help the community come to a consensus about the way forward. Is a block size increase even on the table right now, or would it ever be in the future? What are the prerequisites for it to happen? I always just hear "decentralization". What does that mean? We need more nodes? We can easily get a fuck ton more nodes if core says that would be the trigger for a block size increase. People need to know that there is some sort of plan for bitcoin's future other than just hoping that the lightning network solves everything.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:34:49
Well, you just try to be as careful as possible. Anytime you download a wallet or use an exchange, make sure you are at the official website.  If copy and pasting addresses, make sure they match by visually verifying. Don't click on links if something looks even slightly suspicious. When a hardware wallet is not feasible, you would ideally keep wallets on a PC that remains offline so it is not at risk of being infected by anything. Paper wallets are still a solid option for secure long term storage.
Cryptocurrency is still young and people are still working out the kinks. Hardware wallets are one such solution that have just came out fairly recently. Some newer cellphones include a "secure enclave" chip which can provide stronger protection for wallets on your phone. I believe Breadwallet for iOS is one example of a wallet that uses this technology. While I think its probably less secure than an actual hardware wallet, I think we might be seeing more of this type of thing in the future. 
Standard bank accounts are hacked and have funds stolen from them all the time. The difference here is that your funds are generally insured to some extent when you have them in the bank. With cryptocurrency, you ARE the bank, so you have to take the responsibility of making sure your funds are safe.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:13:14
Ever try buying gold? Fees are higher.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:19:41
If you create a paper wallet from a pc that does not have internet access, then it is not really at risk of hacking. Paper wallet are very inconvenient though. You can not really spend from a paper wallet without "sweeping" the entire balance into a digital wallet first. Paper wallets are pretty secure for long term storage, but are vulnerable to theft, fire, water, etc.

Just curious, why on earth do you want to pay for bread or electricity with bitcoin? What advantage does it offer over using a credit card or cash in these scenarios?
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:05:39
What do you feel is complicated? Depending on the wallet or website you use, it is just as simple or even simpler than something like PayPal.
If you want to send btc to someone, you just put in someone's public address or scan their qr code. If you want to receive money, just send someone your public address or let them scan your qr code.
Getting a wallet is as simple as downloading a wallet app. No need to even bother creating an account!
Want to convert your usd into bitcoin? Just sign up on coinbase and put in your personal and banking info.
Notice that the most cumbersome process is the part that involves working with usd.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:02:16
Wouldn't that just open up space for new miners to come in and mine bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:05:29
This is a great explanation, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:10:49
What he meant is that the DEVICE called Trezor shows you a string of 24 words which mathematically corresponds to the bitcoin private key, and can allow you to restore the wallet on a new device or on some software wallets. No organization ever sees your key.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:09:49

Look at it this way, you can probably brute force the password at some point eventually. Computers will continue to get more and more powerful. Even if it's not feasible to brute force for another twenty years, imagine what it could be worth then.

Seriously, half the posts here are just talking shit about other coins or subreddits or fork attempts, and half of whats left are just memes and "to the moon" circlejerking, and then of whats left, you might have a tiny bit of actual interesting content, but the discussions for those are still filled with BS. It feels like this is a subreddit for children. The 'other' subreddit which was formerly a bitcoin subreddit is basically the same but even worse. I've considered unsubscribing from here multiple times, but I just wish I knew of another place where bitcoin could be discussed in an adult manner.

If transactions are off chain, doesn't that take away one of the key traits of bitcoin, having a verifiable ledger of all transactions?
And I'm still not really sure i understand how this helps things. So i can open a channel with someone and we can do many transactions with each other... But how often are you realistically going to be transacting with the same person in a short period of time?

If you want to mine, don't bother, an average person can't make money from it. If you want to run a full node as a hobby which also helps the network, download bitcoin core and read up on full nodes.  If you want to purchase bitcoin, coinbase is an easy site to get started with.

You could lose everything that you invest into bitcoin. But you could also earn a return of many times what you put in. At your age, don't worry about losing, you've got your whole life to make up for it.

There is also a bitcoin testnet which you can use to practice with totally free. The electrum wallet lets you enable testnet mode, then there are some websites where you can get free testnet bitcoins (that have no money value). You can practice creating wallets and sending transactions back and forth.
