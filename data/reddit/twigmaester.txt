My father is waiting for 5 months to get verrified on bitstamp by now. No explanation as to why is that from their side. Coinbase verification took us only 2 minutes..

I just dont understand what is confusing about bitcoin Cash. I mean I get it that youre retarded and find it confusing. I hate to burst your bubble, But a lot of people are in fact not retarded. The only people that ever said this was confusing were trolls from this sub. Well at least I hope youre a troll, probably just a retard

Sadly this sub isnt censorship resistant :/ lmao so wrecked

Well this is the exact reaction I expected my father to make. Instead he threw 1500€ at me to invest in crypto for him. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:36:30
20 cents is still too much

You dont know the circumstances his dad grew up in. In his perspective he is just looking out for his son. Dont be so harsh on him

My schoolmate bought 1 btc for 900$ and sold for 800$ xd
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:54:08
Its like youre an idiot
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:48:43
We should take into account that by the time every person on Earth would hold btc the population would be bigger.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:16:43
Because I never invested in one. Using my 1TB ssd was plenty enough for me.

I was sleeping when the dip to 5.5k happened :( it was 5150 on poloniex, But my orders to buy started at 5k :/

I have a decent enough pc. But dont have an HDD. Is an HDD neccessary for running a node succesfuly? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:53:53
You are extremely stupid for thinking your argument changes anything. Its not about coffee, what if I live on an income thats less than 2.5$ per day (I dont know, just about 50% of the entire human population) and I want to transfer 1$ worth of btc to my family/friend? The coffee example is used just to be more aproachable to the western population. Get schooled

100k is the true psychogical limit xd

Bittfinex printed some USDT out of thin air and pumped the price as always. Were you born yesterday? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:02:50
Everything dips eventually whether we like it or not :/ now will this be a 50% or 90% dip you cant know for sure. 90% is probably an overstatement, But it sure would give us a good chance to buy some more :) it Will probably be over 50% though. Keep in mind that the last 6 dips were between 30-40%(on poloniex). And those were average dips, meaning the new low was always higher than the previous low. When we talk about a bigger deep we mean that the New low after the dip would be lower than the previous low after deep (the last one was between 5100-5600 on different sites).

Not sure why youre getting downvoted o. O
People should be legitimately concerned about this thing not just brushing it off lol
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:54:35
The fact is that after 100k 1k in increase will only represent 1% of the price. Its like we would get excited for every 80$ increase as of now.

Eth and EOS are 10 times better than bitcoin. And I think ethereum proved it self as a working product. As did monero, litecoin and many others. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:40:27
I think this has everything to do with how much people invested in crypto. If you didnt invest more than you can afford to loose, like me, you can sleep peacefully and hold while the bear market lasts. On the other hand, someone that invested way too much is going to be sweating hard and constantly hear the trigger Word "crash" in the back of their minds. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:22:59
But bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin

I believe you 100%. Guess ill hear about your lawsuit in the news
