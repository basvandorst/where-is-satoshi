Wake me up when bitcoin makes a move ��

No we don't trace addresses, but we scan all your sources of income like the bank accounts and income that are linked to your identity like your PAN cards here in india. In india you are required to prove your identity before you can trade in an exchange.
So even if you do not tell anyone about your gains the people at the exchange are going to report them anyway.
Even when you transfer your coins to a foreign exchange, you will eventually sell them and receive the payment in your bank account and then it can be traced. When sold for cash it is a different thing.

How do you buy bitcoin using fiat then?
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:52:36
Note- sorry for the incomplete title. I have a client whose bank statements show payments being made to an indian bitcoin exchange and when asked about it, he was hiding the fact that he was investing in bitcoins. I am already investing in bitcoin for a year now and feel that you should report your gains.

Gst is the tax charged by your exchange on its services. The capital gain tax is the tax on your cryptocurrency profits, if you don't profit you don't have to pay any tax. Risks and reward are yours.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:10:34
No, i mean how do you get your fiat into the exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:15:36
No it won't it will be taxed as a capital asset in the same manner as the capital asset acquired by you.

Yes if can stock pile that amount of cash into your house without someone noticing and when u get caught you will have to pay a 200% penalty on your income 
Believe me paying 20% tax on your  +50% gains is not a bad deal to get out with your money (rates. Applicable in India)
As soon as the people will start using it as a currency the government will also consider the change.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:05:29
Yes you can cash it out to save 20% of your taxes provided you can manage to stack all that cash in your house without anyone noticing it. In which case you will be penalised with income escaping assessment at the rate of 200% of undisclosed profits.
It is better to pay 20% tak on your +50% crypto gains and live a happy life after all.
If the people will start using it as a currency the govt. Will also reconsider its status.For now everyone is making money out of it and is treating crypto as an investment vehicle.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:40:57
Because people are not using it as a currency. How many times have you paid someone in bitcoin? Do you invest in crypto to gain from the pumps or because you think it is a better currency than the indian rupees?
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:17:59
That is a loss i think as anyone won't be able to prove that you realised the money from the coin because you have lost it altogether.
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:29:14
That's great. There's everything i'll ever need

E mail text 
 "As we heard in the budget speech, the Indian government is discouraging crypto currency trading.This has been clear also by government actions in the last year, and has put our business under a lot of stress and putting us in a position where we don't feel that we can continue our business in a professional manner any longer.
Until new rules are in place for tokens on public blockchains, we are halting our trading ( ETH/INR pair) platform and will focus 100% on our consultancy working with permissioned blockchains".

Media doesn't know anything about Bitcoin, they just know how to manipulate the news for their own benefit.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:39:32
Is there something to worry about?
@_date: 2018-02-16 09:32:32
Next checkpoint- khali bali
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:43:19
Lol never considered that option
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:57:15
How many petitions are there?
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:47:01
Yeah that would be great, can you provide me the links?
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:50:59
How do you do that?
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:36:13
Noted that ����
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:35:38
Thanks, but now it's too late.
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:34:00
Thank you, I have yet to learn how to use it.  If all goes well maybe I'll buy a nano x very soon.
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:41:41
I think ledger suits my need
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:51:06
Exactly, that's what I was gonna do next..
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:30:14
You can easily get some Bitcoin from Indian Exchanges like koinex/Bitbns/coindcx and wazirx. They use peer to peer deposits and withdrawals. I don't know how a bank is supposed to know what you paid Mr. X for. 
I'm doing it and will suggest you to use the same while you can. Go buy some ��
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:44:16
It looks like you are in a complicated relationship with banks. I'll wish you luck for the future ��
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:31:57
If my bank tells me that, it would be the last thing I'd hear from them.
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:50:20
It will reach you eventually before your exchange gets hacked..
