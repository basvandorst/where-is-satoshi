@_date: 2017-12-05 22:55:30
does it have bacon? :D
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:32
HODL and wait for the dust to settle. :)

As a veteran, BUY THE DIP. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:24:28
exchange rate. thats why. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:12:16
This. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:14:04
Buying at ATH is like getting stabbed by that falling knife. This 6k correction is great. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:08:02
The price doesn't seem to change much i've noticed. If it does change its because it's adjusting to market prices. But there certainly is a $20-30 price difference, a small amount imo. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:07:31
0% transfer fees from and to your bank. Just sayin. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:27:57
i'd sell it if you're up on it. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:27:44
I paid $4.12 to send $1000 on Electrum. Confirmed in 20minutes ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:06:09
bittrex.com is dope, really fast exchanges and confirmations. Easy to convert back to btc and send to your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:33:17
fee's. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:05:36
you poor soul, you'll arrive at $3000/btc at this rate. sigh. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:42:34
if its pending, it's only a matter of time :) you'll get it eventually. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:52:34
I second blockfolio. Best 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:38:39
I sent it to their linked address, but yeah. Nothing -_-
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:34:27
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:53:02
gdax best. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:54:58
There's a buy price and sell price, you wont get market price either way. It says what rate you're getting it for on the right side when it shows the price breakdown. FYI. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:44:57
I suggest buy it from the manufacturer, 100% Guaranteed safe product, especially if you're storing a loot of coins. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:40:07
How do you mess up the verification? Anyway, Bittrex, Kraken are ok. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:45:28
I went into my account and selected deposit in btc, and it gave me an address to send to. I did that. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:42:43
Brb. Making a podcast on ETH :p 
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:39:42
See what you did, it went below $4k. -_-
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:26:16
Yeah man, starting to notice a trend with them... not good. Hopefully I can get this sorted soon. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:48:29
We're going to the moon. Remember ? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:03:43
Electrum is really nice. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:13:22
depends what the child fee is. convert it to your local currency and see if its worth it or not. If it isn't,  then next time just pay a little more for the send fee and it'll get processed in a few blocks. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:13:06
The dip is approaching ����
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:23:02
you can expect your transaction to happen in less than 20min instead of low balling the fee and waiting days LOL. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:59:37
still on earth. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:23:21
buy yourself some gold coins jmbuillion.com they accept bitcoin ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:31:52
Enjoyed this! Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:04:59
THE REAL DIP IS HERE $3600 and sinking! 
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:56:49
fees are a little high, but easy way to liquidate your crypto into your bank account. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:31:18
sell gold at a jewelry store. you might get a little less than market price but still cash is cash :) 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:26:51
and hodl
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:45:34
Trezor - 
KeepKey - 
Ledger - 
all very easy to use and most secure. once you acquire one of these, send your coins to these. it's like withdrawing money from a bank (cash) and putting it in your wallet. :)
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:08:10
you're looking to pay about $3-4USD to get it confirmed in less than a hour. Otherwise good luck

the higher the miner fee the faster it'll get picked up and processed. I set mine to max and it takes literally ten minutes to go through. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:52:21
desktop is pretty solid, and its really straight forward. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:48:16

I bet you're doing well now a days :D 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:57:22
10-20% fee's. Ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:17:13
this will help you understand. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:38:57
Was cringing the whole time I watched it, wish I had got in on that action back in the day. Sigh. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:17:32
LOL me too. No regrets 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:32:01
show me your analysis. :P 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:50:30

@_date: 2017-08-22 19:43:43
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:05:26
definitely looking into this. no fees as well. Only downside is the IRS haha. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:39:21
try CPFP, should speed up the transaction by a lot. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:09:40
Me too, I decided to get a hardware wallet, very happy with my ledger :) 
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:22:51
I mean if you need some money you can always transfer to your bank and such. But yeah hodl for now ����‍♂️

I'd only do business with exchanges listed on bitcoin.org just saying. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:27:23
ETH took off like a rocket, got a chance to make some profit :D 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:28:07
This is very likely why, their back-end (coinbase) is having some server issues. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:48:56
....aaaand its back up to $4k LOL 
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:15:44

You'll probably lose money with it. But it's a fun hobby

@_date: 2017-09-04 17:02:37
Couldn't have explained it better myself. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:14:40
Right. They can't ban something they don't control. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:51:36
And this is why you keep your coins in your Trezor/Ledger. 
But yeah Kraken sucks, had tons of problems with them before even being able to deposit any funds into them. Glad I stuck with Coinbase, fee's suck but reliable. Also GDAX on their backend if you want to make limit sell/buys
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:08:50
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:48:05
Clingers do that. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:42:35
Lol where's the proof 
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:53:16
offline cold storage is the best like I said :) 
rule of thumb as i've heard, never keep your assets on the exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:15:34
Probably more relevant than Chinese fear mongering of the BTC market

@_date: 2017-09-04 16:57:26
if you're going to sell, sell at $5k. Or just keep watching on GDAX and see where you're comfortable at. But right now it's a bit low. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:18:19
Buy in below $3000 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:04:45
