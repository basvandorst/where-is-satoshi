No u can’t earn bitcoin on Reddit. Only way to “earn” bitcoin is to buy it or mine it. Absolutely nobody will give u free bitcoin and if u have that attitude ul get scammed so quick ur head will spin.  NONE GIVES AWAY FREE CRYPTO..EVER.  (Except airdrops) .  This is a place to ask questions and learn or to post an idea or thought. You figured out how to write post.. there isint much more too it. Just play with the app , u will learn how to use it. Find a list of crypto subreddits and subscribe to them. When ur subscribed any post put u in that sub Reddit will show up on ur feed. The community is usually very helpful.  If you have a question about a certain topic or exchange., find thier sub Reddit and post ur question there for a better result. Glad to have you here��

Binance?  You could use a DEX exchange but you would need etherium to deposit not bitcoin. Depends which alt coins you want as well . Find the coins you want, then look which exchanges they’re on. Pick the best one after DYOR.

I have yet to see a debit/ credit machine that doesn’t have some type of screen to  show u the total. I would never agree to it if there’s no screen.. obviously

Well mabey they charge to retrieve the funds so if the amount is to small to pay the programmer for an hour..or however many it takes they can’t do it. If they do it for , you they gota do it for everyone. They gota set a limit somewhere or they will have programmers working full time just retrieving  nominal amounts of funds that ppl screwed up on. I know these are not nominal amounts to us.. but to them it is. It sucks. I have no idea how they retrieve it, ud have to talk to someone else about that

I buy from coinmama.. not the best rates but I’ve  been waiting 5 weeks to get verification on every other site. They just verified me first so I use them.. haven’t had a problem yet tho and I’ve bought 1000”s thru there. But quadriga cx is ok.. kraken is good.. but you will be waiting a long time for those to get verified if it’s your first time buy Coinbase is great for beginners. You will pay abit more in fees but they will verify you quicker and it’s very simple.

The power to control thier own money? Ppl are to stupid for that you think? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:53:30
That sucks man but what do expect them to do? Spend money to recover your funds that you screwed up with.. we all want freedom from banks but a part of that comes a responsibility on your behalf to be much more diligent.. there’s nobody there to hold your hand and help you when u fuck up.ESPECIALLY if it’s your whole savings account. Triple check every address. Triple check everything! This is 100% your fault and saying kraken stoke your bitcoins is just false. I am sry dude that’s brutal. It’s a simple mistake but that’s life. Don’t blame others for your own screw up.
