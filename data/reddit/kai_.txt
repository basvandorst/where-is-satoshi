That's not how we read charts though?!
You don't look at a chart and go "oh, based on deliberately reading the y axis, this visual displacement is equal to a doubling of value, so further over here, hmm yes it appears that over this time the value doubled, I think".
Instead, you look straight to the region of interest and determine the ratio of the amplitude at the start and finish, and note "oh this one is twice as high as this so my money doubled".

I get where you're coming from, but I've seen 27 year olds like this...

Hearthstone is obscure enough that using it as an insult pretty much certifies that you recently stopped playing it. 
What a bizarre thing to feel like a big boy about though...

Cringe. You fucked up.

How do you determine the rate of increase without studying the axis labels?
If you're studying the axis labels, isn't the point already invalid?

When you're assuming things about total strangers and then using that assumption to deride them, you know you have a projection problem.

Had to translate for the kind of dwindling ancient that would go to "nerdy" for a slur on reddit.

The point of no black swans is to highlight the epistemological limitations of induction. It doesn't say anything about determinism. We don't know if the probability of Bitcoin hitting 10k back in 2010 was 100% or 0.001%.

Human speculation doesn't influence the weather. People shouldn't be too quick to dismiss this with unthinking mantra.
So far all of my purchases of Bitcoin absolutely have been preceded by searches for "Bitcoin". Researching exchanges and vendors, checking prices a few times, reading news etc. Live access to this data would be worth fortunes on the grand scale.

Hasn't all this kaleidoscope trading been debunked...
