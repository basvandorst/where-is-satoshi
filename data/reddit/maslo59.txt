Cool story. How big is the blockchain?

Then we need regulated exchanges.

I would also add that calling for fraudsters to be punished after the fact is different from calling for proactive regulations. Libertarians who disagree with financial regulation can still support punishing deliberate fraud in a court of law. Libertarians are not anarchocapitalists, libertarianism is compatible with minimal state (including criminal punishment for fraud).

I dont think thats how it works, since the OP said that he already had many addresses generated, but MultiBit still generated a new one for the change (and apparently forgot to save the private key), instead of sending it to one of the already existing addresses.

Keep them in your computer, and backed up in cold storage in another location.
@_date: 2014-04-08 08:40:17
I dont understand why the change address is not simply the already existing spending address in the wallet. Why create some new address for change when you can just return it into the original address?
Seems like it would eliminate these problems.
Switching from MultiBit to Electrum until this is fixed.

He seems to confuse "currency" with "legal tender".
Whatever, I dont think this definition semantic battle is important. If he wants, he can believe BTC is not a currency, but a commodity. It wont change BTC.
Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

Does it actually work - can it be scanned by a QR reader?

You should never leave any significant funds (stuff you cannot afford to lose) in any online exchange. Only what you immidiately need to trade.

So, do we actually have some proposed way how to fix the possibility of 51% attack, or its consequences for Bitcoin?
There are altcoin proposals which mix PoW and PoS, meaning you need not only 51% of all hashing power, but 51% of all coins to execute such attack. Can this be adapted to BTC blockchain? I remember reading about a way to convert ongoing pure PoW currency to PoW/PoS on the bitcointalk forums, but I cant find the thread now.
EDIT: p2pool miner built into the official client (to ensure it spreads) could also work.

How is this possible? Files that you dont flag as shared to public are not visible on Dropbox website if you are not logged in.
I have searched for files in my dropbox, and it has not found anything. Perhaps that wallet file is shared to public?

There is no hot gaseous HF in a LFTR. Its fluoride salt, not hydrofluoric acid.

The point you refuse to see is that Ethereum would not be just about simple transactions, but also other more complicated financial contracts. Read up on decentralised autonomous corporations.

Yeah... I dont think it would be a big step in securing the network, but its good for promotion.

It will stop deliberate backdoors. Unintended bugs, thats another matter, but thats unavoidable in any software, humans make mistakes.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:26:06
Its OK if he does not want / cannot fix it yet, but if there is a known serious bug like this in his software, he should write a notice in big red letters on the MultiBit main page that the software is not yet safe to use. Not ignore it. Apparently OP is not the first one who lost coins from this bug, its been known for some time.
@_date: 2014-03-02 08:44:30
I dont think anyone ever claimed that BTCs in the Blockchain are untraceable. Just that addresses are not easily connected to actual persons. BTC is pseudonymous, not anonymous.
@_date: 2015-02-11 09:11:16
Its not a dumb conspiracy theory, there is plenty of evidence that its true:

Well, is there a cryptocurrency proposal that does not have to do this, while still maintaining decentralisation?

You mean all computers?

Faster block time. Sorry, you will never be getting your coffee with BTC if you have to wait 10 minutes for the first confirmation. With LTC, you have to wait only 2,5 minutes. I would go even lower - 1 minute seems to be the ideal time for an everyday use currency (and internet is getting faster all the time).
Also, Scrypt instead of SHA, which is better for long-term decentralisation.
Sorry, if all you have against LTC is that "its not innovative enough", then its a pretty poor argument. IMHO its technically better than Bitcoin, and thats enough for me.
