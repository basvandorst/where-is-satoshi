[Codeacademy has an intro to Python]( course that's pretty good.  Free, too.

Sorry.  Bitcoin is like any other money.  The exchange rate for how many dollars you get per bitcoin changes, depending on how many people want to buy or sell bitcoin at the moment.  OP is gambling $40K that more people will want to buy than sell bitcoin soon, causing the price to rise.  The ~$200 per bitcoin he has paid today might be worth $400 per bitcoin a little while from now, at which point he could sell his bitcoin for about twice what he paid for them and double his money.  Not an entirely unreasonable bet, since people were paying $400 per bitcoin as recently as November.  However, the price of bitcoin has been declining in pretty much a straight line since the glory days of December 2013, when people were paying $1100 per bitcoin.

If the market goes his way, yes.  Of course, [this graph]( of bitcoin's price over the past two years does not look like the graph of something I'd be long in at the moment.

For businesses to use it, the price has to become stable.  For the price to become stable, businesses need to use it.  
So long as bitcoin is more a speculative plaything, it can only continue to be volatile because its value is tied to a belief rather than real-world goods and services.

I wonder how many dollars per hour they're losing?  That's usually what brings on the pressure for the poor grunts tasked with fixing things.
