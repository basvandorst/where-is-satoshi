It would be great if the supplier included a small sticker with a guide explaining what cards are and how to start using them. This could be a really good way to introduce people to bitcurrency.

Out of curiosity, how was the experience? Do you still have your BTC on the exchange? How much did you end up losing in total to fees? if you don't mind me asking.

I have a somewhat related problem: I was looking for a way to buy bitcoins with my credit card and found the secondlife=&gt;virwox route. 
 
I bought 7K-ish Lindens for $30 but now second life won't let me transfer the lindens to virwox because of their "risk API"
I got 100sll out but the rest just keep getting returned to me.
If any second life users want to buy some lindens from me and from OP for BTC I would definitely appreciate it. Or even just help me transfer to virwox.

Yeah, I saw the virwox credit card fees and decided the $.30 in-game fee was much better. Didn't expect my money to get stuck. Fortunately, because it was a new account, they only let me buy $30 worth, otherwise I would be sitting a lot more useless(to me) SLLs
I was under the impression that SL was blocking my transfer not Virwox. You say it is the other way around?

considering it's only 30usd on my end and about 15 on yours I would be willing to mix the two numbers and then just split it after it is out in bitcoins.. I'm gonna email virwox as suggested by the guy above and see if they will let me deposit my sll first
