He owns BTC because people have gifted it to him. He's stated it's a negligible amount and he himself has never gone out and bought Bitcoin. This sub seems to however keep perpetuating this conspiracy theory that Peter is stock piling Bitcoin but bashes it and shills gold because of his business. Easy on the tinfoil.

He states holders of shares of the ETF will have no rights such as giving up voting but isn't this entirely based on how the ETF is structured? For example, companies still have shareholder votes.
He states that the ETF fund may not adopt a privacy soft fork so these Bitcoin's will not benefit from the added privacy, but why would said Bitcoins be moving at all in the first place? Secondly, if it's a soft fork wouldn't it be backwards compatible like how segwit was introduced?
I think the biggest thing he misses by far but sorta mentions via manipulation is an ETF gives institutional investors a comfortable and easy way to short the hell out of the market.

I don't disagree with you, I am pointing out and disagreeing with  whom seem to thinks Satoshi says this in favor of big blocks.

I saw this before on a website I was trying to use and just said fuck it, not worth the hassle.

We didn't need better hardware than we had in 2009 to make lightning network a possibility, we needed better software and a better understanding of applied cryptography. Satoshi was one of the early pioneers of payment channels.
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:19:51
Great, we should continue doing things that way less we risk pushing a feature to Bitcoin that could be quite damaging. When a technology has proven itself and it does not compromise values like decentralization and scalability, Bitcoin can then seek to adopt it. You know that much of the tech Monero uses was originally drafted and intended for Bitcoin, right? You know, Monero, an actually anonymous coin.

If you were paying $50 for a transaction, it was confirming within the next block, not 2 days. Are you trying to paint a false narrative?

That's fine that they don't want that content on their site. If not for the fact they pretend to be the champions of free speech all while selectively enforcing their own censorship policies. After all, we can't blame Twitter, Facebook or whatever for not wanting "hate speech" on their platform, right? Only nazis^tm support that :)

There's a difference between child pornography, which creates real victims, and drawn art... which has no victims.


@_date: 2018-10-29 01:35:57
I'm not calling people that are into lolis pedophiles, but would you rather pedophiles getting off to art which causes no harm to anyone, or well... the latter? Same argument goes for child like sex dolls.
Here's a more obvious example: Would you rather people use violent video games as an outlet for stress, or take that stress out on people in the real world?

Didn't know most investors buying S&amp;P 500 ETFs know how each of the underlying companies work, what their business models are, etc. Pretty sure they just think it's a good bet to make on the future. Same concept applies.

I am joe blow traditional investor for 20 years, I want to invest in Bitcoin. What's that? I need to set up an account on some website I've never heard of? I need to install this piece of software I've never heard of? That's not good enough you say? I need to buy this hardware usb stick thing? Holy fuck this is complicated, maybe I'll ask my son...

"oh hey here's this ETF in the same interface I use to invest in stocks/ETFs for the last 10 years or so"
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:27:38
What does that have to do with anything? There are ETF's that target industries, indexes, etc. simply because an investor wants exposure to something doesn't mean they have to become an expert on everything relating to it. I think a lot of aspects of Bitcoin such as needing to "be your own bank" and learn what a hardware wallet is a huge bridge a lot of people aren't willing to cross.

Education is only part of the problem. What you are doing is a pretty common form of projection. "If I had been educated, I would've concluded X therefore if others were educated, they would also conclude X." Unfortunately, that isn't the case. Not when you have a significant part of the voter base who value security over freedom and liberty. Practically every country that has welfare only introduced it *after* universal suffrage.

BRK hasn't done significantly better than the S&amp;P 500 in recent years. For insider trading, that's pretty bad.

Dollars as is is not for generational savings or preservation of wealth. It's for future investment, or a safety net which incentivizes spending and cash flow. You could make the case it was back on the gold standard. When you incentivize long term hoarding of your primary currency, you inevitably stagnate consumer spending.

He does own both from people gifting it to him. It's a negligible amount. He's clarified this claim that keeps popping up.
@_date: 2019-02-22 04:54:51
Yes, it's literally 20-30x better. Pruning the way it works in the Bitcoin Core software could easily be introduced. However, EOS's concern isn't with encouraging every user to run nodes. Sure you can shit on EOS for that, but that's a different point entirely. Instead, I'd shit on EOS for the fact only 5-6 block producers provide a queryable database just as the tweet says.
@_date: 2019-02-22 02:17:21
This is incorrect... the entire EOS chain is around 200 GB (blocks.log) but to create an **indexed** database, like what a block explorer would need to perform rich queries takes around 4-6 TB.

Except most people aren't responsible, and that's part of why there's a growing dependence on the welfare state.

Sounds like you just triggered more taxes.
@_date: 2019-04-20 23:06:16


I disagree. Yang's UBI does not have the same welfare traps current welfare does, i.e. income monitoring.


He has stated removing them is the goal, but first we need to phase them out and make them less appealing via UBI. Burden wouldn't increase, but rather decrease as UBI is given indiscriminately. The less people on the current welfare system, the less people to monitor hence less resources needed.

If Satoshi set the if statement to expire at a certain block height, it would be a soft fork to extend it further if a "fix" hadn't been found... like I said, you must think Satoshi is an idiot.
@_date: 2018-11-30 01:41:43
This post also seems to entirely miss the point as a visa transaction does not need to split excess expenditure into change addresses. For example, if I have $1000 bitcoin in a single input and wish to only spend $10, my transaction will still spend $1000 with $990 going to a change output.

@_date: 2018-11-01 04:02:12
Code could have easily been included so that the limit would expire after a certain block height, say a few years into the future. It wasn't. I think it's interesting that typically the same crowd of people who argue Satoshis Vision^tm essentially imply that by this, Satoshi is incompetent af.
