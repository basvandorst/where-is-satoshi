Well that was an ordeal but it's finally up and running again. It only seems fair we offer some kind of 'compensation' for our little issue upon launch, so the promo code "sods-law" will offer 12% off for anyone who pays using Bitcoin in the next 2 days, on top of automatic entry for the prize draw.

If you are in the UK you can buy direct from [Discount Book Club](
Edit: You have to change currency to BTC in the top right corner of the website.

If you live in a high population area then the 'safe spot' for localbitcoins seems like a good idea. In the future I could see that as a viable solution for people who don't like the idea of meeting strangers with wads of cash. Hopefully you could make it the norm to *only* meet up in safe spot cafes, which would be good for Bitcoin as a whole.
You'd probably have to offer that service for free and supplement it with food / merchandise sales though.

Unfortunately we have run some tests and are still getting this problem intermittently. Therefore we've turned off Bitcoin payments while we sort it out for good, which may take a few hours to a day. In the meantime anyone who pays via Paypal and provides us with a wallet address via a support ticket will still be entered into the prize draw. I'm really sorry for this embarrassing issue.

Oops, that's not a good start!
The button is hosted by Coinbase. I'll try and get it fixed in the next 10 minutes and get back to you. Thanks for trying to pay with Bitcoin :)

I'll bare that in mind. All other feedback sounds good though, so that's one more website that will be accepting Bitcoin by the end of the week (hopefully) (Y)

^This was the real selling point for me, but I'll be saving at least some of it as Bitcoin ready for when it's more widely accepted.

Is the website down or is that just me?

I thought as much. I just sell books so I guess there's nothing I could realistically do to break the rules. Thanks for the quick answer.

Ha I expected it would be. Well wish me luck!
