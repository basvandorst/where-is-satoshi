Most people just have a centralized communal wallet with coinbase though.. Suddenly one payment channel to coinbase takes out a shitload of onchain activity.

Yea LN node operators collect fees and then pay them to the miners to open and close channels. Obviously they will keep some of the fees for themselves which also incentivises non mining nodes for the first time

That is basically what btcjam does too.

Maybe  it isn't that cheap, but at least it looks like they might take your cc. I don't know what Indian bank options might be available. If you can send swift wires I would recommend kraken.com and bitstamp.net.

Solar is generally still more expensive than utility power, so no.

It doesn't make them lose fees. LN fees get bundled into on chain fees. If there are billions of micro payments on a channel that wants to close, it can afford a large fee.

In the long term the panels stop working and need to be replaced. Maybe soon solar will be cheaper than mains but  not yet.

Sounds similar to btcjam.. Basically a btc loan platform.. Might work, but youll probably just get scammed a lot or to prevent scammers, the signup process will have to be so invasive that hardly anyone does.

Yea more revolving credit than a loan, but the problems (fraud, verification) are probably the same

IMO there is no chance of that. If segwit isn't activated payment channels will be done in a more centralized manner using something like bitgo to act as a 3rd party notary preventing malleability.
