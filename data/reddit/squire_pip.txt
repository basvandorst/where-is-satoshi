Wow, I love the look of the Android client. Is there a dark theme?

He didn't pose for the picture, that was pulled from his photobucket account which Leah found using the email address she obtained by socially engineering the model train company.

Man, I gotta give it to you for perseverance, but you have absolutely zero ground left to stand on here. You prophesy the fall of Counterparty, but can't identify what will cause it. You claim people are going to get burned, but will give no reasoning for continuing to hold this belief. What are your credentials? What inside knowledge do you hold that justifies this stubbornness? Are you PhantomPhreakXCP's alt account? Perhaps xnova in disguise?
If you truly want to save people from making what are according to you disastrous financial decisions, why are you withholding this nugget of wisdom and truth from us? Speak you now, doomsayer! Enlighten us all! Or don't, and give it up. Because you're embarrassing yourself.
TL;DR: Put up or shut up, before I tag you as J.R. Willett.

I'm sorry to hear it. I haven't had such issues but I'm confident that if you get in contact with Mark Hergott and talk to him civilly about the issues you've had, he can help resolve them. He seems like a pretty good guy from the email chain I've had with him. Best of luck!
