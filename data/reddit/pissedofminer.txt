Yes that is correct.  Just be prepared if they do close as most exchanges cannot function without banking

My main point when I started to write this was to show that if we as a community cannot put an end to this frequent industrial scale fraud, theft, manipulation, etc., that many of us have become used to.  We will lose it. 
The media will cover every single incident just to fearmonger the general public.  In years past the governments would have let it fail and enjoyed that the average person had no trust and stayed away.
Now everything has changed with the adoption by Multinational corporations.  That will be the only reason governments need to do what they do best and screw the entire thing up with over regulations, laws written only for these same corporations.
We all know how the corporations operate, and we all know how government operates.    Pandora's box has been opened, do we nurture it and let it set humanity free?  Or is the government going to nurture it and enslave humanity with it?

All alt coins are based on the prices of bitcoin, ethereum, etc.  Only the main coins have a Fiat pairing.  Everything else's price fluctuates with it's paired main coin.

only if Tether can keep pumping it up
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:03:21
oh no.  Leaving it on cryptopia is more dangerous than storing it on a hard drive and then posting your private key on facebook.

USDT is not one that I will go near.

They have now lost banking and have no access to Fiat!!!

I'm not going to say that.  No one can time the market or what it's going to do.  A couple people might get lucky guesses, that's about it though right?
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:52:12
If it does that's some serious trouble cause it costs about 1k to make a BTC.  That would be a total system failure as it only works because of incentive 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:51:47
Not just 1 major hack, many, very loose security.  Much worse news too.  There's a reason governments around the world are moving to regulate this faster than anything else in history.  If it wasn't such a big deal, governments would give a shit if someone did 2014 all over again.

So everyone that adopted cryptocurrency due to the small group of people that was able to consolidate real money and wealth from the masses in the global financial collapse.
They have unwittingly been scared into taking money and assets that weren't consolidated into the hands of a couple and now have consolidated the money and assets into those same exact hands.
one of the 3 named involved in Tether, was involved in the global collapse.  Interesting how the architects of the 08 collapse and the same now.

This will be what really does the damage.  "Chinese Bitcoin miners control more than 50 percent of the currency-creation capacity and are connected to the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem through the Great Firewall of China. This slows down the entire system because, as Hearn explained, it is the equivalent of a bad hotel WiFi connection. It also gives the People’s Army a strategic vantage point over a global [currency."](

@_date: 2018-02-03 10:57:51
be realistic, 99% of people aren't and that's why wealth is always concentrated into smaller hands

neither the US or China would want to stop it.  Complete control over all communication on the network would give say...China the ability to control the finances of every single person that uses bitcoin and any other coin built on top of the network

Every single TETHER that comes into existence enters the market through Bitfinex.  In creation and initial distribution there is not a single real asset or money involved.
Money and assets only become involved once the Tether has become part of the market.  So exchanges, traders, investors, etc. that interact with tether IS using money or assets to interact.  However, the act of creating and introducing it has no ties to the real world.

actually the byzantine general problem isn't impossible to solve.  You just have to look at the problem from far away
Now, I have no idea if I'm correct or not.  Not factually at least, and there is no possible way for me to even test my theory
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:17:46
Except the 500% wasn't inflated with the same amount of cash that came out in the 50%.
Stop looking linearly 
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:20:43
Damn I wish I could do that with Cash
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:32:07
Well China has over 50% of bitcoin' s hash rate.  The worst part is the entire internet enters China through the government's firewall.  So they have the capability to take control 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:30:51
blockchain doesn't need cryptocurrency.  It's the other way around
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:31:06
Why would anyone need to do that though?  When a country becomes the 1 trillion dollar Zimbabwe example.  Either other countries come take their resources or monopoly money is worth more.
Why print BTC when you can just print anything else and let the ignorant masses give you all printed monopoly money that a countries resources back up?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:00:18
Let me try a simpler example.
BTC created - cost of electricy, hardware.  Real world "Money" and "Assets" enter the system which pays for the cost to create the BTC or other coin.  Real money in the system.
Tether created - typed into existance, no real world cost to create.  Has the same value as the real money entering the system.
Tether value then replaces the "Money" and "Assets" in the system with nothing.
Real money and assets removed from system by tether.

I finally see why everyone hodls.  If they went to sell it, it would have to be worth something.

@_date: 2018-02-04 17:34:10
people miss the point of why government would even want to attempt this.  It has nothing to do with making money, it has everything to do with control over people.  The ability to cut them off from the system if they are dissidents.  Just look how china uses the great firewall to control their citizens.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:30:44
This is especially true when the worlds 2 largest supercomputers are in the same country.

This is the exact reason the U.S. moved on this faster than government ever works.

Tether is created and is sent to Bitfinex only.  So explain how USD is actually being spent for the USDT.  
Is Bitfinex spending USD to buy Tether from itself?  Are people giving Bitfinex USD to buy Tether from them?
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:17:39
Sadly being called a fudder, having any news article that isn't cupcakes and rainbows called fud.  Doesn't mean much to people right now.  If people didn't want to pay attention to everything that happened and they lost money,  I don't think anyone is going to feel bad.  The people that had no idea because they were scared off with the anti-fud hysteria, people should feel bad for them.  Especially when most of the old timers wasn't saying much of anything to people.  They let the greed take over just like Bitconnect.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:32:56
They don't take control of the miners, they control all the communication between the nodes behind their firewall and to every outside node that is linked.  It's how you overcome the Byzantine generals problem.  If the messages going to the generals is controlled, every decision can be controlled.
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:40:26
what was the ATH of BTC in 2012?  Shit I bet it's easy to hodl through
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:22:18
I bought and I sold ATH.  Just cause everyone else that is hodl4life didn't see this coming and lost 1/2 their portfolio overnight, doesn't mean the facts are fud.  Even the coinbase writer makes a nice statement about that at the end.

it's only volatile because of human greed.  If it had all the proper characteristics of currency, it would be stable over time.  BTC has been anything but stable over time.

One of the most powerful things blockchain will be used for is A database of every algorithm of every living thing.  
That's just going to require enormous amounts of processing power and energy.  With cryptocurrency there would be no incentive to grow the network.  
Almost like a parasite/host relationship.

if you bought the dip at 17k I feel for you
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:57:00
I never suggested BTC or other coins are created out of nothing.
Most coins are created through the cost of equiptment and electricty.  Real world value must be used to create those, which gives it a real value.
Tether is typed into a computer and instantly created.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:21:58
Sure when someone can prove that bitcoin is even half of what it's shills have claimed.
At least ETH has a purpose and businesses are leveraging against that

Yeah and what is your point?  The first pre-exascale computers are done.  The U.S.'s is fully up and running this spring and is a minimum of 200 petabytes.  China's revising the one they were going to release just so they can be over 200.  exascale's will be out in the next year or 2.
