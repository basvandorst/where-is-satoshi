The ELI5 version of this is: imagine your computer can run 3 simultaneous copies of, I don't know, World of WarCraft. You can have 3 instances of it open at once and everything runs fine. Now imagine you opened 50...things would start to break. Maybe not even work at all. You'd need at least 20 more computers to handle that. Maybe you have 20 computers available all the time and pay for them all the time, but maybe you normally have 10 computers and need to get 10 more.
Ok good 10 more computers, but are you sure that every computer can realistically be identical and that what works on 1 will work across 10?
Ok good, you know it will work. Can your connection to the internet handle all the data that needs to go through each connection for each one of those? Coming and going.
Ok good, you know that will work. Now, what about the servers you're connecting to? Do *they* have the capability to do all the things that you are essentially testing on your end.
Now scale that from 50 to 500. Does everything still apply and work correctly?
Coinbase isn't just a web app. It's a web app front end that connects to an API backend that connects to a database backend. Those probably need to pass through authentication servers to verify other things. There's also a mobile app layer that interfaces with that, and a merchant API that interfaces with that, etc etc etc. There's lots and lots of complex layers with specific configurations and moving parts. If there's any sort of minor inefficiency anywhere it can snowball as things increase exponentially.
Not only that, but that's just the whole "standard website" part. That doesn't even include security for bank transfers and everything related to verifying cryptocurrency transations.
