Welcome to the crypto-sphere. Step 1: Don't panic.
In my experience, Changelly is fine. Most of my transactions go through with no problem. Occasionally a transaction gets stuck or fails. In those cases, I send them a polite support ticket (include Changelly transaction number and the hash). I get an auto-response almost immediately, and a specific, polite answer within a few days. I've always gotten my crypto back.  Changelly is not perfect. Whether crypto is refunded or the transaction is pushed through seems to depend on the individual responding, and, yes, this can be very frustrating. They offer a lot of trades, but sometimes those currencies are not available for a period of hours or days (STR/XLM, NLG for example). Like many exchanges, they're overloaded right now, with the added complication of the holidays. I often force myself to take a deep breath and remind myself that Crypto is not like a credit card. It's slower, more prone to complications, subject to wild fluctuations in value, and sometimes comes with obscene network fees. I suppose I trust Changelly, Shapeshift, Bitstamp, Coinbase/Gdax as much as I trust any exchange. I've had bad experiences with Bleutrade, but they do offer many coins, and maybe you'd have different luck with them. A lot of other exchanges, like Poloniex, have suspended or delayed ID verification for now. Good luck! Just send Changelly a *polite*  and brief ticket and have some patience. I'm confident you'll get your crypto back.
