Someone bought btc at 18k...
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:54:42
Anything over what I invest now ($100 here and there) is enough to see decent returns imo

I have a small portion of one because I can’f afford 1. Got into cryptos late last year and it was already outside of my reach. I believe people will eventually realize that bitcoin is no tullip. Glad to hear your story!! Kudos!

Done!

They can’t control it nor do they understand it. As with anything, avoid MSM.

The only reason you should be checking the price often is if you’re going to buy more. Some new buyers can’t tolerate a 2k dip lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:07
NO, SELL, PANIC
So I can buy more
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:54:25
Last and best chance to buy before the bullish run towards 25k

UNCLE SAM IS COMING FOR YA!!!

Nothing new under the sun

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:53
I hope it goes as low as possible honestly
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:00
Preventing people from selling/buying
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:29:26
What do you think?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:56:24
And that's why Goldman is my second last name.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:54
Potato quality I see
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:20:19
They’re scared
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:52:54
Considering that Bitcoin has grown 10x this year....
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:24:25
I did, about a month ago.  Overall returns of 80.45%
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:34:01
Same here! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:58
They both can return massive gains but for short term profits I'd stick with FIFO.
