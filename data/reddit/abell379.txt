There are plenty of online banks that are no fee and give good interest. This is an easy solution.

Nothing like a dramatic title huh?
@_date: 2018-09-09 23:24:04
This title is so misleading.
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:34:37
I mean you are right, not sure why you're getting downvoted.

I don’t see how more regulation solves the issue. As of right now, most of the stock is locked up in institutional holdings which has a lockup period that ends sometime in January. It’s called a bubble and they happen in normal markets. It happened with the dot-com boom and bust and some say it happened with pot stocks as well.
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:24:17
The proof is in the pudding. There's no pudding yet.
@_date: 2018-09-13 03:55:51
This is such cherrypicked information though. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:15:31
Dude, investment is a good thing. You make it sound like buying a stock is something only elites do which is definitely not true.

Between you two, which one is a billionaire?
@_date: 2018-05-17 20:26:41
Why so much hate bruh. That's literally the idea of banks.
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:14:21
They're spending it the wrong way though. Instead of putting it into a retirement fund or a low-cost index, it's into highly depreciable assets.

There's no need to call someone a bitch for having an opinion other than yours. Have some maturity.

Yes, but property rights in China are far more limited than say rights in the US. You can't just lump it all into one basket, it depends on the systems of governance.
@_date: 2019-08-11 05:29:31
What sort of policies would these be?
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:40:25
You completely forgot about stocks.
Bruh, Bitcoin is still volatile as all hell, you can't bank on future stability given the wild swings. As others have said, the zero default risk is inaccurate and oversimplified.
@_date: 2019-06-08 19:29:35
What's the point of using bitcoin if you can't buy anything with it? People are dreaming if you see that kind of adoption within a decade.
@_date: 2019-04-14 19:05:09
Why does that first guy need to move 500k/day? I can see crypto's benefit in accessing a few thousand, but his other example seems extreme in that regard.
@_date: 2019-04-23 03:36:49
It's just personal finance. I'm not going to invest in something so volatile as crypto, not when there are far better options in overall stock market funds or even a savings account. 
A pyramid scheme is a little dramatic don't you think?
@_date: 2019-04-20 22:09:48
Why would a sitting president ever do that? Their interest is in the government and right now, the government doesn't want anything to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-23 00:05:07
I've stated this earlier. People love to harp on the portability of bitcoin but if anything it's a security hazard at this level. Why on Earth would you have a million bucks liquid and not invested?
@_date: 2018-11-07 16:21:30
I mean it's r/Bitcoin so people will try to be optimistic regardless of the content

Because investing that much money in a high risk asset is just gambling at that point. Buffett isn't interested in bitcoin, he sticks with value investing off of profitable companies. 
It's like you're trying to buy houses and some guy comes up to you offering his rare coin collection. Even if the coins became more valuable, you still didn't know anything about them and that's just blind investing if you don't educate yourself. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:35:08
dumb title.
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:42:28
This is so cherrypicked. Selectively picking one month that the overall stock market performed poorly in is just click baiting.
@_date: 2018-11-10 19:04:37
This is literally untrue. Please do more research before making grand-scale claims like this. Research indicates that it would take a 625x625 square of miles to power the entire US. And this is from a 2008 study conducted by the US Department of energy so doubtlessly the figures have changed now. 
I get that you're arguing for sustainable investment into clean energy, but please do more research before doing so. It's a complex problem that requires a complex solution.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:39:05
Since when has bitcoin risen by a fixed percentage? This is such unrealistic conjecture.
@_date: 2019-01-04 04:52:45
Sorry man, but you're comments are kinda loopy. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Buffett isn't interested in bitcoin. He's doing great without it. He's interested in finding undervalued companies and getting wealthier from investing in those companies and so far he's been incredibly successful at this.
Also, you're telling me that during 2008 you would have invested in bitcoin, in the middle of the recession? You're dreaming.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:20:15
Dude, c'mon. Bitcoin will never be worth 1 mil per coin. You would need tens of trillions of dollars invested to get even close to that value and that's just not realistic.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:11:48
I never understood this. How does hodling bitcoin, which at the time is being established as a virtual currency, increase its legitimacy as a currency? You need liquidity for a functional currency and bitcoin cannot provide that in it's current state.
It might sound ignorant but I'm honestly curious.

To what extent though? Yang's case for UBI on that measure has never made sense for me from that front. Saying that our labor value will decline is pretty nebulous and unhelpful, it matters to what degree humans are being devalued.
This thought also runs counter to the incredible rise of tech industry and millions of jobs there, not to mention service industries and technicians.
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:13:22
Give me a break dude. You're saying fiat will collapse by 2021 and giving no evidence as to why. You need evidence.

I don't think any of these "facts" would hold up if you invested in say Mt. Gox or other scams involving bitcoin. You seem to be just cherrypicking info.
Any about the asset stuff - every investment will have a risk/reward model. Bitcoin has an incredibly risky history if we simply look at the volatility and the lack of ways to use it as a currency. 
On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 is far less risky since it captures profits from the general stock market. Don't fly your flag under the anti-narrative message, when this post is itself a narrative.

Don't invest money you are not prepared to lose. That being said, define how much you are willing to invest then justify it to yourself. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:39:54
Let's treat bitcoin like an asset because it essentially is one. Bitcoin is now hitting a one year low at $ 3,836 dollars per BTC as I write this. Any investor should have thought behind why they are investing in an asset and a time horizon to cash out at.
BTC is a speculative asset, meaning there is a high risk, high reward value given to it. Are you prepared for Bitcoin to dip more after you invest and moreso, are you prepared to stick with it? Any sound investment need time to make profits. 
Everyone will have a different opinion about whether its a good or bad time to get into crypto. In order for you to find out, do some research about why the markets value BTC at this price and whether that could change substantially. Once you have your reasoning, it's up to you to make that call.
Good luck!
