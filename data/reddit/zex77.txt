I invested $1900 in btc in mid November when btc was around $7400...I had $1900 just sitting there in my wallet doing nothing...and guess how much profit I made since then? :)

Agree bro!

Totally agree. Thanks.

Thanks buddy. Will keep that in mind. I do feel that btc has a great potential and if it continues to rise this fast next year then skys the limit.

Over 13k and still not stopping! Whats next? 14k by the end of the year?

As Im an artist I got paid in btc instead of dollars and euros for my illustrations. I got paid really well. I got almost one third of btc for just 2 drawings. I only invested $1900 in btc when it was $7500 and thats it. Will hold of course.

I started dealing with BTC in May this year. And I got half of the BTC. I was also lucky when BTC was $7500 two months ago and I invested $1900 and now seeing BTC rising to $12k makes me so happy :) do I hold or sell? :-)
