Why is coinbase purporting to have increased my limit when it hasn't then? Can you see why me and many others believed it was a scam?

Received this email not long after contacting coinbase regarding my limits.
Coinbase resolved my query. And not long after I received this email.
It looks nothing like coinbase usual emails. And the increase stated in the email didn't reflect in my account.
Thankfully I didn't log in via the link in the phishing scam. But checked my account through my app.
I would recommend installing Google authenticator for 2 stage verification.
I know there are a lot of people who would likely fall for this scam

I don't feel I am. The amount the email claimed I had been given is more than double what I actually have. Don't you think it's weird the e-mail has a Bitcoin logo as Well? What about the other alt coins.
An increase in my limits have nothing to do with bitcoin specifically.
But I'm just trying to help the community ����‍♂️

I just hope this helps people out. I don't want the negative press around coinbase. One of the most popular sites.

I believe you need to have you ID on coinbase. And make varying levels of buy orders. If you sign in to you account. (Not on the app) head over to setting and limits you'll see the amount they require of you to increase you limits

This is the advice coinbase sent me:
I’m sorry for your trouble! It appears that you’ve been the target of a fraudulent email attack designed to steal your user information. Malicious actors will attempt to create similar-looking websites in an effort to get you to enter your login credentials there.
If you did click any of the links in the email please change your account and e-mail passwords as quickly as possible.
Can you please copy and paste the full email with headers in a response to this email? A quick guide can be found at this hyperlink: 
I can also offer the following recommendations:
1) Utilize a strong, unique password that is not used on any other websites. Strongly consider using a password manager of your choosing.
2) Take advantage of the 2-factor services we offer, either via SMS code, or the authentication apps provided by Google Authenticator.
3) In the future, always make sure the URL in your browser’s address bar starts with  before entering any information. It may also help to bookmark the website and only ever use this link to access your account.
4) Regularly check the IP login activity of your account by signing-in and visiting this page: 
5) Practice due diligence when enabling any 3rd party applications to access your account, or when enabling and sharing your API key. It’s possible to see any 3rd party apps which have permission to use your account, whether the API access enabled, options to regenerate the key, and further API restrictions on this page: 
I hope this information helps. Thank you for using Coinbase.

Ive used coinbase for a few months. And have never seen an looks or worded like this. Also why would a email from coinbase have a Bitcoin logo on their email. They let you buy and sell eth and lite coin. And finally The limit the email is claiming I have I don't.
