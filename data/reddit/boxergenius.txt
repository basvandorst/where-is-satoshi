E.g. there are no specific details on "How to create and verify a wallet", but it provides a good general introduction and what the first 5 key steps in getting started with mining are all about.
I ask you to comment on your opinions for an intro of 600 wd. Is it good? Is it bad? I want your opinions, community, pls. I've been writing cryptos/blockchain for two weeks now.

Actually, I should rather have written that this is "The list for the month of June" instead of "The next 30" xD My failure

China is the country most involved with crypto and mining, annoying that they get tough with the industry itself

Hey, I'm sorry to hear that. Don't worry or get traumatized. Scams are always the order of the day in any job market. Had the bad experience of a remote job that I was never paid for recently. They owe me about 650 dollars. It was a frivolous scam. It had to do with crypto (job), however, as my wife says: they can do that to you even in an office...
How long did the people at DIXIIV HACKERS solve your problem? Thanks for the tip. I'm interested!..

It would be good if they really loosen the regulations soon

It's the best, really. You can pay with it now many services. Ask if your community is accepting bitcoin. After the December 2017 hike, it became known worldwide.

Use this page [ for bitcoin invoices. It is secure. It's quick and easy. Any of your employees can send it to you with just one click. It's not for advertising or anything. I discovered them in February and they've really made things easier for me when I get paid. =)

And you're racist by the way... What's that got to do with where I'm at? Now understand why you don't even have karma
