Bulls turn into bears easily though.

If 2018 mirrors 2017 it will.

Honestly, I don’t think it will be a bad thing if it goes down to 10,000 and stays there for a while. It’ll put of any reckless speculators who’ll turn the market into a true bubble and end up destroying it.

You might be right but unless retailers start accepting it its not going anywhere anyway, its kind of a catch-22 situation.

Afaik the most liberal projections for the end of 2017 were around 10,000, if it goes up to 15,000-20,000 now it'll attract all sorts of wild speculators thinking they become millionaires overnight and scam artists looking to take their money, and threat will gaurantee the market will implode. Steady, slow, reliable growth is the best thing that could happen to BC right now.

I can only talk about what I've read and heard but I don't think regulation is that much of an issue, at least in the US. The treasury seems happy to let it keep going as it is for now. Other countries might be different but by its nature its difficult to regulate anyway.
I've no idea about tech, afaik it depends completely on the Lightning Network becoming viable.
What I think will bring a huge change is when online retailers like Amazon &amp; Ebay start accepting Crypto as payment. Right now the turbulence has probably put them off but if the market is calm for the next nine months they could decide that they could roll it out in time for the christmas market, which could create another boo which could land us right back to where we are now, except people will have lost their house instead of their car.
