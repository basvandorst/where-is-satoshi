Real talk:
You know very well what this is about and why people want to discuss this. Btc holders and lenders fear they will be left hanging out to dry with "limited liability" while bfx continues to operate with no responsibility. That is all it is about. Maybe it would be wise to stop talking about this for now. We will see when the announcement comes. 
You (control) were holding the funds for customers (ownership), but this was not a hack through negligence of a single customer (getting a virus, phished whatever), it was a systemic breach of your system. Like the difference between so get skimmed for his bank card vs. the bank getting robbed.

In other words: margin funding providers who had the lowest control over their funds shall be used to bail you out possibly losing 90% or more of their stack. And it's completely random, too because their is no way a margin funding provider knows to whom his funds went. GREAT. Time for the injunctions to roll in.
I'm fully expecting to log into my account and see a big fat zero there.

thx for the kind words. I'm not expecting this guy to give back a single penny. I'm writing him so he understands that stealing these amounts of money is not a funny joke but affects lives of normal people who lose their entire existence who he has no idea about.

"ownership" vs "control". You were in full control of these wallets (together with your security partner bitgo). The users didn't have anything but an IOU/claim on these funds. This is especially true for usd lenders who were never in control or possession of any coins so to speak of because THEY DIDN'T even know who they were lending to. If you tell lender A, well you got lucky because all your funds were taken by some eth trader, and lender B, well bro shit happens all your funds were lend to a bitcoin guy who got everything robbed of him how would we be even able to check that. You know yourself that there are probably millions of loans often for pitiful amounts of $30.
I really, really hope in my self interst and the interest of BFX that you don't try to pull what dalovindj is implying. That would be a bloody legal mess.

So can you give any comment about some form of bond/iou issued by bfx? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:27:43
no idea whether you're gonna read this or not. First of all I just wanna congratulate you on your technical prowess. Pretty insane how you emptied out the leading bitcoin exchange.
I'm sure you know but I just wanna remind you that you are not simply moving some numbers. Lives rely on these numbers. Live's such as mine. I'm a single father of 3 boys and a life changing amount on BFX for the purpose of lending (you can check my post history in pm). I used the monthly payments to support my family. If this money is now gone I have no way to support my kids and will seriously contemplate suicide so my boys get the insurance payment. Hope you remember what is behind the numbers you move so carelessly.
Congrats. (Just making sure you really read this and keep the impact of your actions in mind)

Can you comment on that cryptoworm guy on twitter? He opened his page on 31st of July and claims he has also stolen ETC of you. Are you 100% sure that etc is still there and that there are no further worms/trojans/viruses on your platform? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:05:48
Well, I have no idea how they determined 18:00 utc in the first place. Whethere it's the moment when they noticed the hack or whatever I don't know. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:35:09
Easiest solution to me seems like the following:
1) Pile up all different assets and value them according to the stats you have posted (bitcoin=604, etc.)
2) pile up all outstanding claims from customers
3) calculate the difference (~72m dollar at max, maybe even less) 
4) take a an equal percentage of funds from everybody (exg. 40%) to cover this loss
5) issue some form of bond that represents this loss ( 72m bfxcoins) and fill up the costumers accounts. Those can be traded, withdrawn and put on other exchanges whatever. 
6) Buy them back with any money you can get your hands on (profit, vc capital whatever) over time
Can you tell me whether you've considered this option and why it wouldn't work?
What would be even easier:
Issue some coin (BFXcoin) that gets treated as a bitcoin on your exchange and replace all missing bitcoins. Replace these fakecoins with real coins over time. First solution is fairer though unless you equally distribute these.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:27:42
It's far too late for that I think.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:35:34
I don't understand this as well. Withdrawl of bigger amounts like 5 bitcoin already takes hours upon hours on bfx normally but apparaently their security was so shit they got emptied out without any claimed security breaks. GREAT
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:52:02
unfortunately with being partly disabled I have littile choice in earning an income. Lending on bfx was a chance for a stable income and worked for 2 years. Calling me pathetic is fine. I don't care about what you think. I know that I was able to bring food on the table for 2 years. This is now over. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:37:27
How is this news? This is what Zane has told us for the last whole day. Nothing new. Also 604 for bitcoin? Losses are now offcially over 70m. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:18:25
Judging from your posts it certainly sounds like BFX has already made up its mind about the situation. If not then please don't go around telling people how their USD is supposedly unaffected and how they'll be able to withdraw their balance easily. This heavily indicates to all btc users and lenders that they are supposed to take the loss while others walk away unscathed also the failure was entirely on your side.
Keep in mind that for example lenders don't even have the possibility to know what happens with their money. What if it gets used to buy bitcoin that were themselves lent. It's impossible to determine this for a lender.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:51:57
Is bfx assuming any liability for this loss? Are there any plans to use bfx assets (company value/held currencies/expected profits) or issued ious/bonds to make affected customers whole again over time? What about acquiring a loan/selling part of the company to aqcuire funds to pay back the affected users?
How does bfx intend to prove to lenders that their usd were in fact loaned out to btcusd holder? I personally know that bfx loans are split into millions of subloans often not more than 30 usd each. How are you intending to prove that these exact 30 usd were lent out to a guy

I'm saving this for later because this is the most interesting sentence you've probably said since the beginning of this mess. I'm very curious of what will come from this.

Sadly this is exactly what it sounds like. All of his statements indicate this. I could understand if they offer those users "affected" a stake in the company and promise to pay them out over time but telling them they are shita outa luck would be an outrage with potentially enormous consequences.

good to see you back, did you get some sleep? unfortunately i did not. any eta for the platform coming up?

No reason? Do you realize that his name says "Bfxhacker" backwards and the account is 8 days old? Big fucking coincidence.

This article is compelte bullshit. Bitfinex was lucky to get out of mtgox a long time ago. Read the bitcointalk thread.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:43:15
There are far less shorts than longs though. The realyl metric would ofc be how much it actually cost BFX to buy back the 120k bitcoin they got stolen from.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:25:50
So in other words it's lender who will be fucked the hardest when they had zero chance to pick their borrower or whether to keep funds of the exchange. 
NEVER EVER was it mentioned anywhere that lenders would be on the hook for stolen bitcoins. Margin funding was always a theoretical underlying for traders. Did I as a lender ever had the chance to look up where the funds that were bought with my money ended up`???? NO!!! WOW FUCKING BULLSHIT BFX.....
