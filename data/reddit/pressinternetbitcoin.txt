They've been a trusted for so many hours, I feel like they're becoming the crypto paper-of-record.

I started out when bitcoin was 250-700 with 6 or 7 btc, and turned that into a different, much higher number thanks to day trading. I've taken my initial out many times over and have a good amount in cold storage. 
He shouldn't have bet on margin, and he should have always had a nice cusion somewhere. 
He acted like a degenerate. I feel as bad for him as the geniuses who plan to strike it rich with the lotto.

Last week, my friend had 0 husbands, and this week she has 1. Given the huge weekly increase, this time next year she'll have married most of northern Ontario.

So you're saying lightning doesn't have security issues? I was worried because my internet isn't *totally* 24/7, usually 3-4 hours downtime a week. 
Its good to know I won't have to worry about being attacked if my node goes down for a few hours.

Most(all?) big companies that accept bitcoin do so via a service like coinbase that immediately converts it to fiat. So volatility shouldn't really matter... 
The only company I know of that doesn't sell all their bitcoin right away is Overstock, and they just keep a small portion and sell the rest.

I have enough bitcoin to not need to work anymore. My point is past performance is no guarantee of future results, and your chart is meaningless.

Good strawman, I never claimed you said anything. Silk road didn't "operate" in a country where firearms were illegal. It was an American website by an American using American Internet in an American state. Firearm ownership is a constitutionally protected right in America. The laptop was Korean, and guns are illegal in Korea, but it was still a website "operated" in the United States.

Good Luck! That sounds like a horrible situation.

So using your logic, we should shut down all porn sites because it's illegal in Saudi Arabia and the internet "operates" there.

You realize this post is promoting criminal activity? Using the financial system to hurt someone else isn't legal, even if you really don't like citibank.

Not true, if someone moved any of the 'original' coins, or just signed a message using the keys, that would be as close to "proof" as one could get.

The problem is you're comparing users to lines of code. 
One group is sentient, the other just runs on people's machines.
You can be shut down for impersonation. However, short of censorship, there is no feasible way to get rid of Bitcoin or Bcash.

No. You are an actual person, clearly not a bot. And you are (jokingly) impersonating another actual human. Represented by code on reddit, but still flesh and blood humans.
Most crypto, (except maybe LTC and ETH), don't have this quality.
