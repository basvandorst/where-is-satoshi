Its been at 10.5k 4 times. Might find a new low in the 9ks before it goes up. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:34:13
Yeah That makes more sense. Still crazy 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:22:02
Simply more bitcoins being bought making the limited supply that much more valuable. Supply and demand. Limited supply + major demand growing daily = skyrocketing prices 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:32:29
I think it’s hype. I don’t they’ll be able to take control of the market like people think. I believe after people see this bitcoin will rise to 30k. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:24:44
He should of provided you with a transaction id afterward so you can track it through the blocks 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:31:30
Wow 900? Then again At 17500 haha. You’re a veteran

Cme and Cboe are entering bitcoin market on December 10th and December 18th for future trading with large amounts of money. More than any bitcoin whale can handle. Depending on their incentive they can either drive prices up really high or fight it to control it to their will. Either way you’ll see some fluctuation at those times. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:32:53
Bittrex has bitcoin around 15,000 with an all time high of 15,800. Gdax has it at 16300 with a high of 19500. I dont understand. Wouldn’t you be able to buy from one and sell to other?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:30:27
If you want to follow patterns. Last climb we saw was when it surged past 10k and hit 11.5. It corrected to 10-11k then stayed like that for a few days before heading to 15k. So this might be same. It can start picking up momentum again by tonight. Even the market needs time to rest. Staying at 16k after correction is a very good sign for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:37:56
When did it change ? Can you link please. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:19
Moving money out is how it starts to correct. Leave people to dump their investments in itll keep climbing. Trust the process
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:49:07
So you’re asking whats stopping bitcoin from becoming a physical currency? My top argument would be once they hand you that amount of bitcoin physically how will the blockchain track it ? The blockchain is how cryptocurrency differs from other currencies today. Since there is a limited amount of bitcoin people can withdraw or lose it and the blockchain will have no way of actually tracking and recording these steps for confirmation( which is needed to keep track of bitcoin value. Unless you’re living in a world where everyone buys and sells through crypto currency, like walk down the street and buy a bag of chips for a satoshi and it re enters the blockchain.

I also started with Coinbase . Trusted them with 2 bitcoins at the price of 22k at the time. Never lost a cent other than to fees. The only problem i had with them is their low limits of 750$ a week for credit cards, couldn’t really abuse good buy ins. Another thing when i transferred all my btc to bittrex they brought my limit down to 100$ ? Idk maybe they got butt hurt. Stop using after that 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:42:55
Stellar doubling on top of its 24% climb ? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:28:19
Why would you sell if it drops 15%-20% ? Lol the exact opposite is supposed to happen. Hold. You don’t lose money when the prices drop. Only when you sell do you really lose it. If you cant handle watch money go up and down, investing in bitcoin is the worst thing you can do. You need to stay calm and trust your investment and trust the market. Learn it’s patterns. Anticipate the future and have fun. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:46:40
I actually prefer a stable slow climbing bitcoin. Gives me a chance to bet on the small coins that have been emptied because of btc rush 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:07:57
The only time it changes is when you’re filling out info. If price changes they’ll tell you to redo it with new price. After confirmation the deal is sealed yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:53:59
If you don’t actually press confirm yes it may change. It happened to me once. They probably haven’t changed anything. May i ask why you would need a certain amount of time to complete transaction? If you’re looking for certain prices to buy in at you can use bittrex or Gdax desktop has auto buy where you can set what price you’d like to buy what amount at. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:05:03
Well i said anticipate 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:37:42
Fellow 619er ? =]
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:30:55
Very nicely put friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:25:24
Someone bought 14,500 bitcoins and sold them right after to profit 200m. Thats why you witnessed that quick surge and drop
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:47:39
If it was sent to an actual wallet. Its gone. If it was sent to a dummy address you can probably locate it and prove its yours and get it back. Haven’t been down that road myself but i think I’m right. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:48:59
No crash till December 18th .... * disappears back into the shadows * 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:40:46
That i can’t tell you. Information is out there. You can check how futures can effect bitcoin for a better understanding. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:21:58
Thanks. You’re cute too 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:54:48
Yes for example I’m holding a large amount of Cardano currency in it’s special wallet Daedalus. Bitcoin will have other wallets to support it. It’ll take awhile to finish downloading and syncing with your hard drive. Then you’re all set. I will repeat that you are safe leaving your money in places like bittrex and coinbase. Only put in wallet if you want to hold for long periods of time. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:37:14
Unless... it’s adopted and tamed 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:54:37
16,500$ is a strong point that it seems to be hovering around. So my guess is lowest 16,500 highest 17200 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:15:02
If people like me and you start panicking and selling that will cause it to crash. Hold and youll be fine. Trust others will hold with you to maintain the value  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:00
He already is in many peoples eyes. At some point above the billions money stops mattering and reputation is what grabs peoples attention. An well hes Satoshi..

Im sure someone that rich has a setup going on. Many accounts under his control.

Step 1 - Search and find a Bitcoin wallet you would like to use. Simply googling will give good results because it’s a hot subject right now. You can compare wallets and see what you want. Download it and move to step 2. 
Step 2 - Find an exchange to buy your bitcoins from. Different sites will have different fees and different prices so that is also worth searching. I personally used Coinmama. At the time it took them 30 hours to verify me which lets me buy BTC at 10k USD a day. If you to be able to buy more you need to be verified at a deeper level.  The process will take longer nowadays because of heavy traffic. Once you pay with however you’re paying. You will insert a receiving wallet address ( check your wallet for that wallet address ) please make sure to double and triple check this address before confirming transactions always. 
It’s actually very safe to have your coins at exchanges like bittrex and coinbase. Never had a problem with them. Im not saying put millions of dollars into them. But its safe to keep for faster transactions. Now if you wanna buy once and just hold for long terms like months at a time. Then yes offline wallet is best. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:01:35
Who needs forever ? A few more years is more than enough to make a lot happy. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:03:19
Yes most bitcoin sellers need to verify their customers for large purchases to avoid credit card scams and frauds. I think there are some that don’t. But they only accept cash and debit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:56:35
No dicks were harmed in the makings of these predictions. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:44:25
There’s really no way to know how much they can weigh in on the market of bitcoins. Only time will tell 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:43:37
Yes as-long as people don’t panic and sell when futures enter the bitcoin market soon. We should be seeing a healthy climb on Sunday night. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:09:51
I highly doubt it. Ever since the first future company entered bitcoin has been more stable in its fluctuating prices. Max drops have been 1k. I say buy in at low 16 hundreds. It wont drop lower than that.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:32:17
I bought in with bitcoin at 10k. Been holding ever since ( 2 weeks max ). At first i thought its the dumbest thing i did because the train has come to a stop but i’ve already made 1.2kUSD  on the 0.5 bitcoin i purchased. It started with anticipations of 15k by end of December.  Now it’s looking like it’ll surpass that. It’s scary and exciting at the same time. The other coin I’m behind is cardano. Im at 50% confidence with bitcoin. 100% with cardano. Ill hold bitcoin until i feel like it’ll drop. Then convert to cardano. Once it picks up again i convert back to btc. Its been a positive climb for me so far. Hope it stays that way !
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:30:43
You’ll witness a dip at December 18th. It’ll cause some panic and then a surge all through the rest of December. Please hold once you do decide to buy in. With prices reaching over 25k soon you can be looking at price fluctuations of 2-3k by the hour. A lot of money can be made... but lost as-well. Be careful. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:56:45
As middle class/lower class investors we’ll always be at the mercy of the big whales that control our markets. Theres single accounts out there that can pull out or buy in into a currency and make values fluctuate immensely. The most we can do is try to figure out the intentions of Cboe and Cme. They could very well drive prices up instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:18:06
Mine was also immediate. I didn’t upload anything i just had a webcam hooked up and took pics of documents on the spot. Hour later i was verified. That was weeks ago before the 10k hype. You have to take in the amount of new accounts coming in with the bitcoin surging. All sites have increased their verification acceptance by  2-3 days due to heavy traffic. All you can do is wait for now. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:25:46
Yeah politics. A nations currency is important in determining its value. Like the U.S is proud of the Dollar. It’s used globally bringing more business and value to its shores. I would imagine they wouldn’t like being at par with every other nation adopting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:19:59
Is the transaction showing up in the blockchain ? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:54:58
Well im sure CME for the 10th but last i read was cboe due for 18th. Could be wrong but this was todays updates.
