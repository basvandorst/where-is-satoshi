Sure, Im not much of a coder but can look into the structure of an arbitrage system based on the two codes. One issue is it would have to support several API's. Take the following example:
12/03/2013 18:55:06 - opportunity - buy at 45.5800 (mtgoxUSD) and sell at 48.6000 (bitfloorUSD) - 6.2140%
This would mean connecting with the bitfloor API however I also found this code

Well one issue is there are no clearing houses as such, so even if you can execute trades quickly, you are still at the mercy of the exchanges. Depositing / withdrawing funds can take minutes or days! Unless more start to accept mtgox redeemable codes or similar methods to move money between exchanges. Maybe some sort of P2P arbitrage fund would be a good work around where people deposit locally and all take part in global arbitrage opportunities.

Thanks walrod! Would be really great to combine this with  to automate and execute arbitrage trades.

Hows it coming along? I've been doing a few experiments with arbitrage opportunities. Im just using a pot of $2K to start with but my biggest headache is inter exchange transfers! Bitinstant offered a few but no longer trade BTC-E and mtgox (BTC-E seems to always trade MUCH lower than mtgox) and AurumXchange as you mentioned, also I saw that Mtgox will stop offering their USD redeemable code in April. It seems like the exchanges which can offer the largest spread seem to be the ones where it is most difficult to withdraw from. What have you're experiences been?

AurumXchange are now offering BTC-E to Mtgox redeemable codes as well as bitstamp, which allows for easier transfer between exchanges. So some more arbitrage opportunities are opening up but its a small window as mtgox will stop their codes soon. An API for inter-exchanges would be a very useful and probably profitable platform as it would in some way work as a clearing house between the exchanges. AurumXchange is basically offering this service but a platform based purely on bitcoin exchanges is yet to exist.

Actually thought more about the practicalities of that P2P idea and it would be too prone to people misusing it, a centralized solution would be needed. People could deposit Bitcoins or currencies to share in the profits.

Yes you a right, starting from scratch would be the way. Finding the arbitrage opportunities through multiple currencies should not be much of an issue. Currently I just run separate arbitrage scripts USD, GBP, EUR export the info to a spreadsheet and manually execute trades when the opportunity arises. Displaying all currencies in USD e.g. btceEUR (35.0000 EUR) 45.6225 USD I would suggest is the first step so people can execute manual trades to begin with.
Having a separate file / config for each exchange e.g. mtgox.py btce.py as there are many exchanges, hopefully the community can chip in to cater to more API's. Should probably focus on USD, EUR &amp; GBP to begin with as taking advantage of many currencies would require accounts, cash and Bitcoins with many exchanges.
