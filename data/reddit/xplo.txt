Fortunate Jack has been caught faking (inflating) stats in the past, but I doubt they're trying to steal $5 from you. Contact their support, it was probably a glitch

Thanks for posting this. I had no idea how shady these guys where, and have now taken my business elsewhere.

No. The 10% adjustment before meant that the network was operating at ~1 MiB / 9 minutes, and then got reset back to it's base capacity (~1MiB / 10 minute). But if 10% of miners drop off now, it'll mean the network temporarily operates at ~1 MiB / 11 m .. which is a huge difference. Basically the network will be at in its most vulnerable state for DoS type attacks that it's even been.

Because maybe there plan doesn't including mining at a loss? When floating costs exceed revenue, they shut down equipment. There's nothing unusual in it, except the halving might cause a large scale shutdown. I'm guessing we'll see a temporary ~15% reduction in capacity, but we'll know for sure in 24h

Good observation, although that could just mean that there's a lot of obsolete mining rigs that are still operating that won't be able to pay for themselves post-halving

I can understand the username. Even if bitcoin miners were in the business of speculating on bitcoin, do you really think they would for example pay $700/bitcoin to the power company, when they could pay $660 on an exchange?
