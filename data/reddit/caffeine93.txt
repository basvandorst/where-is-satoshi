hmm, not sure about that. I'm from EU so I know that Kraken deals with euro, not sure about CAD accounts tho

you should try using one of the larger *actual* exchanges to buy it at market price...all of these services which allow you to buy using credit cards take a larger fee (usually 5% or more)

Miners would then earn from transaction fees entirely, since there would be no more block rewards once the emission of 21mil BTC is completed

you do realize you have a 1 karma account and that nobody will be sending you any coins based on no trust, lol?

reminds me of
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:01:47
and how exactly do you get the information such as that? I'm not aware of the fact that mining machines submit their manufacturer and chip ID when they submit shares to the pool? (let's suppose you don't rely on hashrate metric to compare them to mining machine's reference hashrate)

I'll be honest, I'm not very familiar with specific wallet software so I'm not sure, I've googled the Electrum *replaceable* option and judging by the description, it seems like you should have marked it as *replaceable* when you've sent the first transaction already, does it indicate it as *Replaceable* in the transaction history of your wallet?
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:36:56
well, you have to take into account such scenarios before sending the crypto payment :/ if you've used some other crypto, it'd be likely that transaction would have passed already (LTC - low fees and fast 2minute block times, BCH - low fees, but 10min block times as in BTC, ...), they have lower fee
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:15:10
it's already mined in the block so how could you cancel it? if it wasn't mined due to very low fee, you could try RBF with a higher fee
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:37:34
I fully agree, but you have to understand that r/btc is pretty much ran by Ver, he is on the sub's sidebar, unfortunately. I've tried to point this out, but get downvoted in no time. Everything goes under the banner of *no censorship*, but whenever Ver writes a post there (and it's usually nothing very smart, just provocative and trying to spark controversy and fuel the fire), you'll see it upvoted in no time with lots of praise. If you point out that something is wrong about it, you'll get downvoted which leaves you with two options:
1. Comment with different opinion is marked as *spam* and nobody reads it + they further downvote it
2. You delete the comment in an attempt to save what's left of your karma, thus effectively censoring yourself
I fail to see how this is anti-censorship, I must be too dumb
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:24:44
the funniest thing is, he lights up the fire with a stupid comment, then when the fire is burning the entire community down, you won't see him anywhere, he will silently observe it from the side

higher prices =&gt; more people attracted, trading, withdrawing from and depositing to exchanges =&gt; more transactions =&gt; more people (their transactions) you compete with to get into the block =&gt; higher fee you pay for your transaction to be of higher priority (to be mined sooner)

Just to inform you:


He's not Croatian, he's Czech and he's not an entrepreneur, more like a *politician*
also, I'd warn anyone of this entire Liberland thing, in my opinion, this guy is simply enjoying all the benefits of receiving donations and traveling around the world with other people's money while this idea will never come to life. The land between Croatia and Serbia is a territory which needs to be decided which country legally owns it, it's not a piece of land where you just come and proclaim "this is mine now"
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:38:08
no problem, man
you need to re-transmit it declaring a higher fee and making yourself (like a second address you own) as the recipient (output address) of the transaction
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:51:58
I believe it should work, but you have to consume the same input(s) as in the previous (stuck) transaction 
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:27:06
because, unfortunately, crypto is still to this day mostly used for trading for other crypto or fiat on exchanges and there is very few places where you can use it consume real-world products and services. What follows is that transaction numbers are high when people are active on the exchanges (FOMO buying during the bull run), transferring between the wallets and exchanges. During the bear market, most people who bought at high prices dumped and exited the markets, while hodlers have their coins in cold storage so the overall transaction count is low.

I think people who are using HitBTC are forgetting the fact that this is the exchange that listed Bitconneeeeect while it was alive, lol

I'm not sure how your wallet interprets transactions.
Imagine this:
- You receive 3 transactions of 1BTC to your addresses, you now have 3BTC in your *wallet*
- You attempt to send 1BTC to someone by referencing the unspent output (one of the three 1BTC outputs you've received), transaction is then stuck (as in your case) because of the low fee
Ehm, now...you wallet might already *see* that transaction is in the mempool, thus not allowing you to reference the same 1BTC unspent output you've used before. In this case, you need a separate wallet or manually construct a transaction and broadcast it to the network. Otherwise, when you send another 1BTC to yourself attempting to "overrun" the stuck transaction, you will be consuming the other (second) 1BTC you've received, this effectively not redirecting the stuck transaction to yourself

Bitcoin will always be profitable to mine, for at least some amount of miners, due to low electricity costs or completely free electricity. Also, remember that a certain number of miners will mine even when it is temporarily barely profitable to mine, believing in the long-term price increase of the mined coins.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:22:03
well, if you have any option to *edit* the transaction that you see in the history in a way that you can change the recipient in it or something, then you can do that and re-transmit it with a higher fee, but if you have no such option, then you have to construct it manually referencing the same input, but different output I'm afraid

which is exactly my point, that Liberland is a joke
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:21:59
I have a coin like this, paid $1.5 for it, definitely a scam is she paid $677 for it :(
There are some very valuable ones that actually stored BTC on them by providing a private key hidden below a hologram, but the one on the picture you posted is definitely not valuable
