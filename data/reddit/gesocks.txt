Ok so lets asume there is a worldwide energy los for several weeks caused by some massive sunstorm.
No any miner is running. You and your friends are bored to death and instead of Sudoku u kill your time with this.
After several days one of you find the right hash. Energy comes back. Now you have time till the next miner finds it too and confirms it.
What will you do with you pen and paper hashcode to claim your bitcoins?

U csn not prevent the los in some cases.
Physical values cant be lost forever.
If some old man dies who had no relatives,  the gold in his celar will sooner or later be found, the money on his bank acount will be still existing and given to the cpuntry if there is realy no relatives. Even the lockers in his swiss bank will be emtied after some years.
The private key of his bitcoins will be lost and the coins stuck forever.

I get it crypto curency is cool.
But where from comes this surenes it will be bitcoin and not some other, or several others?

The gold arena

The fact that there will be less and less bitcoins available with time.
After round about 2040 there will be nearly no new bitcoins mined.
Every time somebody loses his private key. Dies without telling smbd about his coins. Bitcoins will be lost.

So dodge coin will be the real deal?

Oh u still would have to worry about your loans.
Or u would be one of the guys who will say in 10 years. I had 10 bitcoins when they where at 10.000. But i used them for my college loans. Would be a Millionaire now if i just would have kept them.

Satoshi is and maybe forever will be worlds only millionair

And if u imagine Bitcoin to be the world curency it would lead to an unstopabledeflation. Meaning nobody would buy stuff anymore except of the very needed cause your money is always worth more the next day. Leading to nearly no spend bitcoins, leading to hyperdeflation. 
So yeah it kind of is a problem if u see bitcoin as a curency.

Yes. But while u just have it on payper the network doesnt really care. So my question was how to get it from the paper into the network before somebody else finds it.

Theoretically. If he gets lucky. What should he do next to claim his btcs?
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:21:18
But then he will be part of it. 
What he actually  means is screw the actual 1% and let me be part of the new 1%

Oh luckily some big Mining Farms need more time to come back online then me with my Single Notebook.
Giving me hopefully a bit more time then just 10 min to tipe all that correcly in there.

Ok you are right. A high fluctuation of money could prevent an inflation. But its much more likely to happen then with fiat money. And if it happens u have not much mechanisms left to stop it.
About the point with 2040. U can argue if im maybe 10 years of. But not 100. 2142 will ne the last bitcoin mined. But already in the middle of this century there will be 99% mined.
