Were are you guys getting realtime data from? [bitcoinity] ( is showing huge flux, 160-200.

I'm using [bitcoinity.org](

Not related to the service, I just think it is hilarious even though I wouldn't play it.

It appears the project just started. Are there any other sites, apps that show where can I spend my bitcoins?
