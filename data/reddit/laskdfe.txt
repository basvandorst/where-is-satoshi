Still not spam. Inefficient, sure, but not spam.
The batching thing could be a user experience thing. If I had a coinbase wallet and sent a transaction to someone, I would want a transaction to occur for that payment. I might be weirded out if i have to wait a minute or two for the next "batch" to combine my transaction with another person's transaction.
I would definitely want my transaction to be broadcast to the network when I hit "send".

If it is possible to be able to sign routing transactions, but not closing channels that could help improve security.
I think it would be important to avoid hardware solutions though, as that effectively eliminates decentralization and censorship resistance from that portion of the system.
(Much like how ASIC tech is a centralizing force for mining)
I appreciate this discussion. Even if we have differing conclusions. It's nice to have actual discussions rather than bcash bcash bcash and calling people shills and trolls. Clearly you have thought about this topic.

LN transaction is not finalized until the channel is closed though. It's *similar* to a 0-conf transaction, since the transaction is in memory somewhere, not on a block-chain. Of course, if you want to turn around and spend it, then yes, LN is way, way faster.
It seems to me that any rational observer of the crypto space would realize that if the LN works well, there is virtually zero reason for most alt coins to exist. Given that presumption, it seems that overall confidence that LN will work is fairly low. If confidence was high, I would expect BTC to have much higher percentage of the market cap.

"Majority of people making transactions" is a subset of "people who want to make a transaction". This subset could be 10% of the size of the full set.
It could be that 80% of users are currently blocked from using BTC due to fees. (I'm clearly just making up these numbers, but I think you get my point)
I suspect that the majority of transactions these days are buying and selling BTC (trading), and only a small portion are what I would call "transactions" (as a currency).

Ah. I suppose if this ignores sending to a segwit address and just holding it, yeah that is a little skewed. However I'm not convinced that more than 80% of transactions are non-segwit addresses sending to segwit addresses.

The opportunity cost of block space is the *price of fees*. Therefore, for every "spam" transaction self-mined, your opportunity cost is as if you actually paid for said transaction anyway.

Correlation vs cause and effect perhaps. Hard to say.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:49:02
I'm just saying they have one similarity, and that is that neither are written to the block chain until settled. I know there are many other very significant differences.
Well, I suppose two similarities.. Not yet written to the chain, and fast to send (in a certain subset of acceptable risk for low-value transactions)
Of course the risk of a double spend does not exist on LN, which is a big technical difference. Though in practice if it's a low-value transaction like a 50 cent donation not many people would care about a double spend threat in *that* scenario.
If 50 cent transactions were plentiful, you probably wouldn't want to record all of those on the blockchain if you had the option not to (ie LN). LN definitely has many significant differentiation to a 0-conf, a large one being block chain use efficiency.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:22:47
Coinbase could optimize their network use. Much like how websites could use black and white photos to be more efficient. Are they doing it "wrong"? Depends on your perspective.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:09:22
Well, on-chain fees will limit the velocity of roll-out. It's not a given that LN will beat out alternatives in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:42:45
That's a reasonable expectation. The network would likely self-optimize over time.
In terms of efficiency of routing and well-funded channels, I would expect hub and spoke with only a few hops between any two nodes.
Are you concerned about honey-pot targets as a result? A well-funded node would be quite valuable, and the private keys (if I'm not mistaken) need to be on the node. 
Of course, the risk to users of said node is lessened, since they can still broadcast an anti-cheat settlement. But this does not stop someone who has compromised a node to gracefully close all channels and simply walk away with the rightfully owned coin of the node.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:46:00
Possibly, but one of those channels would need heavy funding. Their liquidity requirements may conflict with that.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:42:11
Considering LN is a layer 2 tech, and not strictly part of the Bitcoin network (but rather runs using the Bitcoin network), I don't see why it would be added to the core Bitcoin client.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:11:38
There are concerns of monitoring the other party of channels that don't exist in a typical on-chain wallet... And up-time, as connectivity actually matters for LN, whereas it isn't really relevant for a typical on-chain wallet.

Barrier to entry.
I'm talking about new entrants to the space, not existing users.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:59:34
If I'm not mistaken, hubs would need their private key in a "hot" situation in order to operate. Well funded hubs would likely be honey pot targets for attack. (Actually, pretty much any hub, I suppose...)
This would probably be a natural decentralization incentive to distribute risk.
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:15:20
One address can have many unspent transaction outputs tied to it.
For example, a single donation address may receive thousands of tiny payments. Spending from this address would require using these many separate transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:28:46
Looking at a recent block, only 10% of transactions are for values less than $50USD.
Half of the transactions are for over $2,000USD.
Lightning Network will have limits to how much can be sent, due to funded channel limits. I expect that values less than $50 might shift over to LN. However, due to channel funding limits, I expect a majority of transactions that are currently on-chain won't be able to find a viable route on LN. I doubt many routes will have funding to reliably support transactions of over $2,000USD.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:23:37
Aren't those that need it, likely those who can't be reasonably expected to afford current fees?
(Meaning they may not be able to afford opening a channel, and fund it)

@_date: 2018-01-31 14:14:39
0.042 as a spending limit?
How was this value determined? Was there consensus? Is consensus required to change LN?
Here is an exerpt: "This was agreed early on between Tadge, Joseph and myself (when it was closer to $10) and confirmed in the Milan Summit, but it’s worth delineating the reasoning behind it. Channels themselves are limited to 4x that amount, but that’s a simpler thing to change"
Is that 4X funding limit going to be increased? Who decides what it will be? Will there be a vote? How will consensus be measured?
What if you edit the source, increase that to 40x... Can your node connect to the LN?
These limits are rather arbitrary, and are a form of censorship. "No, you can't spend more than 0.042BTC". This is eerily similar to limits imposed on a bank account. Except bank accounts usually don't have an upper limit.
If you open a channel with 4x 0.042BTC, then make 4 max purchases, your channel is fully biased such that you cannot make another payment. I've heard you can just make an on-chain transaction to "top up" your channel. But if the channel already has the 4x 0.042BTC limit hit, you can't add to it. So you have to close it, and open a new one.
Let's say you're a heavy spender:
So, open, spend 4x, close.
Open, spend 4x, close.
Open, spend 4x, close.
Your average LN fee is 1/2 of an on-chain fee.
It does not sound like it was "designed" for the max limit of 0.042, as that's a lot of headache for very little savings.
Maybe if you do 40x spends per channel, then LN fee is lower enough that it's useful.
So, while the technical limit may be 0.042, saying the system was *designed* for any transaction below 0.042 seems a bit off, since 0.042 transactions are a pain, and offer very little utility.
People won't want to open a channel just to make 4 transactions. They will want to get many many uses out of that channel.
So, I expect transactions of size 0.042 to remain as on-chain transactions. 0.0042 Yeah, maybe those will migrate to LN.
So, given that... do you still think that LN will significantly reduce on-channel transactions? I'm not so convinced. Very few transactions that small exist on-chain recently.
Edit: maths
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:31:39
If lightning network is used for micro-payments, would that reduce on-chain transactions?
Currently there aren't micro-payments on-chain, so if LN is only used for micro-payments it should not be expected to reduce on-chain transactions (and therefore fees).
Only if LN is used for more than just microtransactions will it reduce on-chain traffic.

@_date: 2018-01-03 04:42:09
To be fair, it (LN) is an unreleased, highly network dependent ecosystem of software. There is far more uncertainty and doubt for that, compared to increasing a block limit.

They are using the Bitcoin network in a normal way. They could use it in a more optimized way, with some effort, and possibly a slower wallet experience for their users (ie a delay from when they hit "send" to when they actually broadcast the transaction, in order to bundle it with 100 other people's transactions).
I'm my opinion, saying they are doing something "wrong" is ridiculous. They are not doing things as efficiently as they could. Google could make their logo black and white to make their page load faster, too. But nobody says they are doing something "wrong" by having a full colour logo.

Mining power is based on profitability, which is based on the coin price
Technically it's not necessary to have as much power behind the mining, but it's based on economic incentive. If it's profitable to mine, it will be mined. So, since the price is much higher than in the past, there is much more profit to be had by mining. So, more processing power goes into mining.
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:25:56
I meant LN was similar to 0-conf in the sense that further action must be taken to finalize the implied action. I didn't mean to imply that the incentives and attack vectors were similar.
I am curious though. What is a miner's incentive to include an anti-cheat transaction to prevent a malicious user of LN? Is it assumed that the fee is higher for the anti-cheat transaction? It seems to me this must be the case.
If this is the case, is it not a benefit to miners when people need to close channels by sending anti-cheat settlements with high fees?
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:50:53
Essentially, they are claiming that Bitcoin is effectively an ICO for Lightning Network, since it's (BTC) not really that useful to transact with at this point in time.
It is a pretty valid point.. LN is not really field tested. Anyone who is banking on LN to solve issues is effectively using BTC as an ICO for LN.
LN will undoubtedly expose additional attack vectors. 
Of course, there are many who buy BTC for other reasons.

I was considering an observe only situation, where it would constantly be downloading, and always be a few blocks behind due to block variance.
And yeah, with 100% segwit adoption it would be hard to find a fax machine with a 56kbps modem to handle that. Local office supply stores are selling 33.6kbps fax machines which could handle twice the current chain data rate. PCI-E fax modems for sale are 56kbps.
It seems amusing in a certain light, that all of the computing power (near 20 Exahashes per second) distills down to a stream of this size.

Other coins would run into the same issues if their blocks were full, yes. (Assuming they are using blockchain tech)
I don't think price is negatively correlated, but it does appear that market dominance could be. Price is clearly higher regardless of higher fees. However, fee increase roughly correlates in time with market dominance drop. And from a rational standpoint of everyday use being related to adoption, that's not surprising.

If LN is used for non-micro transactions, sure it can reduce on-chain traffic.

A histogram of channel funding limits would be more relevant (to a user) than adding up all funding in all channels.

Even if a LN channel offers long term utility with near zero fees, there is currently a barrier to entry (fee to open a channel).
Many alt coins don't have this barrier to entry. So, even though an alt coin transaction fee may in practice exceed long term use of a LN channel, alt coins are much more accessible to low net worth individuals. (I'm speaking of individuals for which a single BTC transaction fee is a significant chunk of value)

@_date: 2017-12-12 18:10:05
If you take away the names in that discussion, it is an interesting technical discussion. Consider:
It is noted that a $1.50 tip to a vanity address results in said vanity address gaining an additional UTXO with an associated value of $1.50.
This vanity address has many, many UTXOs tied to it now, which will count as inputs at the time of spending from this vanity address.
Thus, hypothetically, if there were 100,000 separate tips send to said vanity address, each for a value of 10 cents, the "balance" of this vanity address would add up to $10,000; however, a subsequent transaction which spends the entirety of said vanity address will have 100,000 inputs.
It is highly likely in that scenario that while the vanity address has a "balance" of "$10,000", none of this is actually spend-able unless fees are low enough such that the fee per UTXO is less than $0.10.
I had previously thought that since all of these tips were filling a "single jar" so to speak, that jar would be spendable as if it was filled by a single transaction. However, it turns out this is not the case.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:13
It's possible that a channel got skewed to one side, preventing payments.
Say I open a channel with you, the vendor. I put in $100 into said channel, and pay a $10 fee to do so. So, $90 is in this channel, and $90 Is spendable by me.
I buy 18 $5 drinks, and thus the channel is now fully skewed in your favour. I can't buy another drink.
At this point, you might want to close the channel, since you know I can't buy any more drinks, and you need to pay your employees. So, you spend $10 to withdraw the $90, leaving you with $80.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:59:42
Note that transaction fees would have rendered this useless unless you're talking about investing $20 a year ago.
If you have many small value inputs to your wallet (such as $20 every couple weeks), the transaction fee to spend your wallet balance can exceed the amount of funds it contains.
For example, if you were to have a wallet today, which has $10,000 worth of Bitcoin as it's balance, and it was funded by 500 deposits of $20, it would literally be un-spendable today. This is because in order to spend the $10,000 worth of coin, all 1,000 input transactions must be bundled up if you were to buy something for $10,000.

The current situation is that zero conf transactions have an exceedingly high chance of being included in the next block on BCH.
However in the current situation, a LN channel closure may cost a large fee to close.
It seems the ideal operation of LN is a hub and spoke model, where you just keep a single channel open indefinitely to a large hub.
A risk in that scenario, is that the hub you're connected to could suffer a DOS attack, since many people would know the point to attack.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:12:46
Technically, a lightning network transaction is not confirmed until the channel is closed.
Similar to a zero conf payment. It's not confirmed, either.

Currently, one provides a more consistent user experience than the other. But maybe LN will mature into a viable 2nd layer. But right now it's a bad user experience for a new user. Especially one who isn't a nerd.

Do you have any data of this claim? Or are you just stating your opinion as fact?
Also, check the hashrate distribution for BTC and compare it. They are awfully similar. If hashrate of one is centralized, then so is the other.
@_date: 2018-08-03 02:44:29
Bullshit. The posters clearly show it is bitcoin cash not bitcoin BTC.
With all the noise about this, it is so painfully obvious that the two are not the same thing.
There is no scam.
Sure you may not agree with a block size increase, and that's fine. But I'm tired of all this shit people say about some virtually identical codebase currency with a different name being a "scam".
Monero isn't a scam. Litecoin isn't a scam. Bitcoin isn't a scam. Stellar lumens isn't a scam. Ethereum isn't a scam. Ethereum classic isn't a scam. Bitcoin cash isn't a scam.
Stop being such an ass to the crypto community. FIAT is the scam. You are fighting against a community that is fighting the same fight.
@_date: 2018-08-03 03:41:53
And by this viewpoint, it appears to me that both are now "yet another altcoin". The hard fork is not completely in the dust.
"Alt" means alternative. As soon as you have more than one option, each is an alternative of the other.
Philosophically speaking, every currency is an "alt" to the other currencies it competes against.

Is it exploiting a well known brand?
What about gentoo linux?

Or.... perhaps it *also* has a legitimate claim to the linux prefix?
The price of one vs. The other is 10x different.. I highly doubt one would get them "confused".

Empty blocks are still valid.
@_date: 2018-10-30 23:43:13
That does not mean that with more coding, people will simply be able to start receiving tips on a channel with no funds to shift to their side.
That's a fundamental part of the design.
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:57:57
You said it would give them no choice. That is factually incorrect since empty blocks are still valid. They have a choice to mine zero segwit transactions if they so choose, even if every transaction is segwit.
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:24:45
They leave some money on the table, yes.
I wouldn't say empty blocks are "dishonest" though. They are entirely valid.
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:47:14
By unfairly cheap he was talking about the funny accounting for block weight, not that they are actually cheap. A segwit transaction is actually larger in bytes than an equivalent non-segwit tx, so it should actually be more expensive than a non-segwit tx in that sense.
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:29:31
I wouldn't say those are similar. If I want to download a 100MB file, I don't have to first upload a 100MB file.
With LN, if you open a channel with $100 in it, you can't receive (download) even $1 until you spend (upload) $1. This is entirely not the case for the internet.
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:30:47
You can just check the blockchain... his address was/is public.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:03:05
I agree this is a big concern for newbies who don't know the difference.
However, if this wallet supports multiple coin types, like Coinomi for instance.. it's only a problem if cash is the default, and switching coins wasn't painfully obvious. That would *really* confuse newbies..
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:14:02
Please chill a bit. I've checked out your other posts and you are clearly a rational person. I'm really not trying to pick a fight. I'm on this sub so I can get your perspective.
I was under the impression nodes are already decentralized enough. I was under the impression that a modest increase in TPS would keep 99% of that decentralization, but increase use cases significantly. (And thereby increase adoption significantly, and therefore also value significantly)
It would be great if segwit was actually adopted... That would also work. It just seems like more work to make all wallets and exchanges do the code change for segwit.
Is there evidence miners are intentionally leaving out segwit transactions? I've read that ASIC boost doesn't work with segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:23:13
I disagree with those who say BCH is "the" real bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-11 14:55:08
If it increases a lot, yes I agree.
But right now you can run a full node on a $30 raspberry pi. An 8 year old computer could easily handle 4x, 8x or 16x, neck, probably even 100x the current blocksize. (But there is no need to push it that far now)
Arguing that a larger blocksize is bad is also arguing that segwit adoption is bad, since it increases the maximum block size about 4x.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:53:38
Oh, no. I actually quite agree with it. I do strongly believe that BCH has a right to the Bitcoin prefix. Just not a right to say it is "the" Bitcoin.
It is an evolution. Much like how there are many variants of Linux. All are a type of Linux, just not "the" Linux. Take Ubuntu for instance. When it first came out, it was an alt-linux. But now it's very popular. However, I still wouldn't say it is "the" Linux. So, even if 5 years from now BCH is 5x BTC, it's still not "the" Bitcoin. It is "a" variant, which at that time, may or may not be the most popular.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:29:21
I agree block size scaling isn't a viable long term solution for mass adoption. Increasing block size now does not prevent future scaling solutions like lightning. I do not want to see 100mb blocks. But if 4 or 8mb or 16mb blocks make fees competitive to alt coins until lightning network is up and running, wouldn't that be nice?
I don't like how people seem to be taking extreme stances of "zero increase" or "no off-chain scaling".
If bigger blocks are worse than high fees, then shouldn't you also be arguing for a block size decrease to 500kb?
And if bigger blocks were bad, shouldn't you dislike the current segwit implementation which allow for 4mb blocks?
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:23:23
Increasing size to alleviate current scaling issues does not imply better scaling issues are more not more desirable in the future. Yes, it's a band-aid. But it does not prevent future scaling solutions.
The thing many who say "slow down, don't rush" seem to forget that there are alternatives without the current issues bitcoin is facing. This results in some adopting other currencies at the expense of bitcoin.
If fees were low, there would be little perceived value in other alternatives.
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:31:03
I really hope you are right. Currently, there is a lot of friction (fees) for it to actually be used in Zimbabwe. It does currently serve the purpose of securely storing value in a place that can't be seized. Perhaps that is enough for now? Perhaps not.

But it is the internet, and it is easy to post fake stuff..  so who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:57:11
Ok..how it was going to be implemented was definitely controversial. True.
In your opinion, when will it need to be changed?
The hurry is that as bitcoin becomes more popular, it's utility is actually decreasing for use as a currency. Saying "no one wants to use bitcoin to buy coffee" is factually untrue. I want to buy coffee with bitcoin. ;) I've wanted to buy a hot dog with bitcoin - I had no cash, a street vendor couldn't take credit card. Perhaps these use cases are in fact outliers...
But turn the tables: I guarantee that if no block size limit currently existed, users would *not* come to a consensus of a block size that currently results in fees as high as they currently are.
If core released a full node with an 8mb limit, I highly doubt it would be rejected by the vast majority of users. Perhaps it would, but I highly doubt it.
The biggest philosophical issue I see, is that without an option for *users* to vote, voting seems to be restricted to a select community of developers.
Currently, the only viable method for users to vote, is with their money. And consider this: if the vast majority of users didn't want the s2x fork to happen, explain why the price of bitcoin was increasing all the way up to when s2x was called off, and afterward, it has been decreasing.
I suspect this is highly correlated activity. Users can only vote with their money, so they have been doing so.

Also don't forget about physical centralization. Some facilities are very large single points of damage (not failure).
If one large mining facility were to suffer from some issue like an earthquake, extended power loss, etc. That could reduce hash power for the time it took to get to the next adjustment (which could be a long time).

@_date: 2017-11-19 00:05:07
If it wasn't cancelled, I don't think it would have really reflected poorly on Bitcoin. If anything it would have shown that seemingly trivial changes could spell disaster for a forked chain if not thoroughly (and I mean thoroughly) tested.
It would have made people think twice about switching to some less mature fork (read: thoroughly tested) tech.
Be glad it didn't happen before segwit, because if it did, people may have been resistant to that soft fork, and made future tech like LN etc. less elegant.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:38:09
If bigger blocks are bad, then isn't segwit bad? Aren't 4mb blocks possible if everyone adopted segwit?
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:43:13
It does seem that miners have a lot of weight, and that mining itself has become fairly centralized. One earthquake in one spot could make a big impact. In am ideal world every user would be a node and a miner. (My opinion, anyway)
And yeah, fair it's not all about low fees. Ethereum fees may be quite low but it has many challenges I think. It was not built/designed for the purpose of store of value and transactions. Also, bitcoin is a great brand. You would have to tell people how to spell Ethereum, then explain that the "currency" is not called ethereum.
I suppose it's more accurate to say, compared to other "vanilla" offerings. One in particular comes to mind.

"You people"?
You seem to have the impression I'm part of a collective "other side" as if there are only two sides. I'm not against segwit. I think segwit is great, and opens up scalability options such as lightning network. The one and only problem I have with bitcoin, is it's high fees, which are reducing adoption. I want more adoption of bitcoin.
"The nodes don't want your hard-fork"
I don't own a hard-fork. I didn't make a hard fork. I had nothing to do with that.

I am very glad to hear it has helped you. And sorry that fees are cureently a significant portion of what many would earn.

This is a reasonable thought. Though I caution a conclusion who who the specific actor is may be incorrect. It may also be correct. There are definitely other actors who would have an incentive to spam the BTC network with near zero fee transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:58:29
Agree. I don't think a modest blocksize increase is bad. I don't want a rushed haphazard implementation though.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:33:59

@_date: 2017-11-11 04:54:33
How is increasing the block size a scam?
It literally reduces cost of transaction for users.
That sounds like the opposite of a scam to me.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:14:13
Arent nodes effectively free? I thought it was "one CPU one vote", which now would equate more to one ASIC chip, one vote.
I assume you meant node as in a full blockchain validating wallet node?
Hypothetically, since you would have preferred segwit without an increase. Is 1mb the block size you would choose out of all possible sizes? It seems rather arbitrary. Was there some reason it is 1mb not 500k?
I'm not asking to be a jerk, I really just don't know why that is (was) the limit, and why many are so supportive of that limit.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:46:48
Me too.. wouldn't they have to control nodes to do that? Nodes can invalidate a block with a bogus miner reward... I don't see why anyone (except the hypothetical greedy miner) would run a node/wallet that would do that.

@_date: 2017-11-11 14:43:54
So you're saying that increasing block size is a scam because it encourages mining power centralization?
How does it do that? My internet speed is such that 1mb approximately equals 2mb, approximately equals 4mb approximately equals 8mb. I don't see how a change like that would limit things to big high tech miners. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:40:34

@_date: 2017-11-11 04:16:54
I'm fairly confident that being stuck with a small block-size that results in large transaction fees is not a "correct" answer under the current circumstances. I highly doubt any statistically significant reduction in decentralization would result from a modest block-size increase in the short-term.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:48:03
There could be a lot of disinformation out there, but it is cold hard fact that transaction fees are high.
This is because it is popular.
I really wish BTC would embrace this popularity and offer an immediate scaling solution (that actually works, aka not just segwit which works if and only if the wallet/exchange supports segwit, and the user chooses to use said segwit capability).
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:48:49
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:05:31
It does make it harder to introduce someone to it by giving them a small amount.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:41:29
There are definitely some potential improvements possible for decentralizing mining. Maintaining a steady hash rate/difficulty ratio is different problem though.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:46:25
I do use segwit. And I do run a full node.
I'm wondering who would truly benefit from an attack if successful. Honey badger getting flipped would kill confidence in all crypto. All crypto would crash. All miner profits would crash. All ASIC manufacturers for cryoto would lose. All users stake would crash. Who would truly win? Nobody in crypto.
So.. Who would win? Anyone shorting crypto... (thats one heck of a risky bet in my mind) or, those who have a stake in fiat.....
This is why I'm confused why it seems crypto is fighting crypto. It doesn't make sense to me. Both sides lose.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:36:55
Hahah no thanks. I just wanted to point out that BTC (and by extension any bitcoin chain fork) doesn't claim a perfect track record, so it's a bit unfair to point fingers at another chain with a similar issue.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:10:18
Hypothetically... If bitcoin's blocksize was currently 10mb, would you be actively pushing for a decrease to 1mb? And if so, why decrease specifically to that amount? Why not 500kb? or 250kb?
What is the magic about the current size that makes it Goldilocks?
I agree 100% that in general, bigger blocks mean less distribution, and less distribution is bad for a system designed to be a distributed system. I'm just not convinced that there is an objectively valid reason for the current limit.
In fact, if increasing the block size is so bad, then 1mb Segwit blocks are bad, since due to the block weighting, they can be about 4mb in actuality. So.. since Segwit increases the block capacity by 4x, and increasing block size is bad... shouldn't it logically follow that when segwit was enabled, the block size should have been cut to 250kb to maximize distribution?
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:34:53
I am new to this space. Please don't treat me like I'm an attacker of BTC. I don't want some other side to win. That would be disastrous to the entire crypto space. Everyone would lose confidence in all crypto if they see the king dethroned.
From my relatively newbie perspective, it seems that the competition only has "low fees" as a selling point. I'm frustrated that this is a selling point. It didn't used to be, but the dramatic popularity rise has changed that.

There are many to choose from.
If you just want cold storage (aka hold it long term, nothing else) you can make a paper wallet. (Though this should be done on a trusted computer free of virus/Trojan, and a reputable open source paper wallet generator).
If you want to be able to use it, you could get a mobile wallet like mycellium, bread, coinomi, many others to choose from.
If you have a large amount and want security, maybe consider getting a Trezor, or perhaps Ledger (though it's less robust), or other hardware wallet. If you don't buy it direct from Trezor, make sure you don't fall for a scam where the Trezor comes with a seed phrase already made - you should be making a new seed phrase.
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:36:31
I think there is a bit less of a risk of loss of access to custodial accounts (2FA, and customer service). But yeah, custodial wallets are definitely honey pots. I guess the moral of the story is to learn enough to properly create and secure a wallet.

That sounds normal. A normal nano setup procedure is the nano coming up with a random set of words, and you writing them down.
There are some scams where people set up the nano with words, and slip in an official looking piece of paper that says "these are your backup seed phrase words" or something of the sort.
But your process sounds normal.

A custodial wallet like coinbase may have 2fa, which would help a bit. It's not perfect, but there is definitely a segment of users who would be more likely secure using a badly secured good custodial wallet than a badly secured non-custodial wallet.
Ideally education would help people be more secure with making their own wallets, but most probably won't buy a hardware wallet... and therefore key generation is not that likely to be secure. Most users provably wouldn't make a fresh bootable Linux distro on an air-gapped system and use verified open source code to generate a secure paper cold wallet, and print on a non network enabled printer, without cache of printed pages... then ensure no data leaks by destroying potential leaks such as storage attached to said air-gapped machine.
Most people aren't that paranoid. And even the process I mentioned has tonnes of security holes.. hahaha..
And my reply was too long. But if the above is TLDR, definitely a process of creating a secure wallet is not for everyone...

To be fair, someone with very little technical skill may end up making a less secure wallet than coinbase.

Yeah, I agree with that. It has potential to allow for many retail-style transactions off-chain in the future.
I just think this is *additional* use to existing use, so I wouldn't expect fees to go down as a *result* of LN. Fees would go down due to a reduction of transactions we generally observe on-chain (ie higher value).
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:22:57
Fees are based on competition. If no ATMs offer a better fee, they can just put the fee to whatever profit maximizing value they want.

Who is Robert? Is that an evil twin??
Yeah. Forks are good. You learn from them. Think of them as a giant live testnet. The only actual danger to BTC from a fork is if that fork is successful. And really.. is that a danger? Nothing says you can't just keep using BTC if a fork gains significant traction. Forks don't impose consensus rules on your chain of choice.

I've seen people store text files on the desktop called "passwords.doc" with no password on login. Never underestimate the ability of a user to circumvent strong encryption.
Also, the "instructions" they may follow could be inherently flawed (either by design, or mistake).

Careful not to lump all BCH supporters into the same pile as the vocal ones who get attention shouting that it's the real one and the other one isn't.
Many also have the opinion both are *a* bitcoin, like a fork of Linux. Different value props, different use cases, different roadmap.

Holy shit make a new wallet and move your crypto if you still have it!
Edit: clarification.. the ledger wallet hardware does show you a list of words on it's screen when you make a new wallet. That's ok. What isn't ok is if it comes with a piece of paper with a list of words already written down. *that* is a scam.

I haven't read the source code, but isn't segwit vs non segwit a bigger technical difference than segwit with 1mb vs segwit with 2mb block?
Current segwit chain is clearly "bitcoin", and 2x is clearly a hard-fork but not because it's significantly different from a technical perspective, but just that it's incompatible with current nodes that enforce 1mb arbitrary limits.
If the current blocksize limit was 10kb, I would hope everyone would agree it could benefit from an increase. And if it was currently a 100mb limit, I would hope everyone would agree it could benefit from a decrease.

Saying nobody else has motive is a bit shortsighted. Literally anyone against crypto in general would have motive. Or, any competing crypto, really...

Transaction fees could play a role. The currency of the future probably looked really bad to a lot of people.
That said, I think it's likely to be a natural cycle of fomo and selling to capture sick gainz and then further selling to avoid the seemingly inevitable drop to 0. The thought of which ironically helps make it look like that's happening.

Many dislike the branding. Many dislike Roger Ver. The main point of contention is arguments around "the real" bitcoin.
If you take away the branding and association with Roger, those people wouldn't have much to complain about, since in that hypothetical scenario it is just another alt-coin. (Which happens to have a relatively large community)

I want to make sure I understand your comment. Can you clarify what weakens bitcoin in the long-run?
The debates? Or a block size change? Or who the author(s) of code are? Or the naming on exchanges? (Some combination thereof?)
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:38:04
Hard to get everyone when you're speaking of large numbers. :/
Honestly though, if the code is open source, does it really matter who wrote code that has a 2mb limit? Or what their motives are? What if your favourite trusted coder(s) made the same change? In the end, open source code is open source code, isn't it?
Or is there a detail I'm missing?... some impact to something based on who wrote the code.
Or is it just a moral thing like, don't eat a cake baked by Hitler? - even if he followed a recipe others also use, and the recipe is open-source.

It's been past 5k for quite some time in other currencies. This "barrier" is only relevant for those who think in US dollars. I currently see bitcoin at $6,965, and a few hours ago, above $7,000.

I can't tell if you're serious or not....
What magical threshold is at 3-4 transactions per second that suddenly makes it centralized?
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:51:00
I think some (most) people who don't realize there are more than just technical reasons may get confused. Some people may get the idea that specifically 2mb blocks are bad... or segwit in any form is bad. The majority of people will probably just get some vague impression that many people don't like "segwit", and you should never use segwit, not realizing that bitcoin is already segwit enabled. Heck, the majority of people probably still don't know what CPU or RAM is, let alone segregated witness or what a hash function is. I bet most people see "segwit" = "S2X", if they are even aware of both.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:45:12
I agree. Barely anyone has heard of any coin other than bitcoin. From a technical standpoint, I like the idea of a small temporary block-size increase, (while things like the lightning network are developed), and perhaps once those are developed and proven to work, the blocks could be moved back down if the network capacity was shown to be scalable with a 1mb base blocksize.
That said, if most people ignore the 2x coin, so will I. The network effect is more important. It's the only thing that actually makes any coin worth anything... the more people (more consensus) the better.

If it grows faster than tech scales, yes.
If tech grows faster though, that is false.
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:52:41
Here is an example of a scam ledger setup:
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:43:15
Lightning Network is essentially a 3rd party app which *uses* Bitcoin. The bitcoin network itself doesn't have a clue what Lightning Network is, or that it even exists. That's why no fork is necessary.
Virtually any cryptocurrency which supports multi-signature addresses and time-lock contracts could potentially use Lightning, or something like it.

I downloaded a wallet. Pretty sure you couldn't pay me 1 satoshi if you wanted to.
"Work" depends on what your definition is.
Say two people Alice and Bob both open a LN channel with Carol, with their respective funds. Both Alice and Bob fund their channels to Carol with $100.
Now, Bob wants to pay Alice $50. He can't. Why? Because the channel between Alice and Carol has $100 in it, but its fully biased toward Alice, and therefore Carol can't "pass" the payment to Alice.
Now, this "works" as designed, but I suspect that both Alice and Bob would have the opinion that it does not "work".
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:21:10
Fair. But I am not sure that the recent rally is due to a magic number of BTC-USD.
@_date: 2018-07-01 21:41:15
We definitely disagree on the measure(s) of decentralization.
This explains our difference in terms of actions to optimize for it.
@_date: 2018-07-01 04:23:09
If you can convince someone to open a channel with *their* funds, yes, you could immediately start receiving payments.
I suspect that there would be an opportunity cost for the other party to do that, so they may need some incentive to do so. (Since you may not have any other channels open, they don't get any routing benefit from connecting to you)
Imagine you're a vendor. Maybe you sell hats. If those hats are $20 each, and you have an inventory of 1,000 hats.. that would be $20,000 in a channel funded by the *other* party in order to sell all of those hats. Now, of course maybe not that many people want to buy your hats, and you only sell 10 in the first week. But that's still $200 in a channel funded by *someone else*. That's not likely going to happen randomly - you will probably need to arrange that with someone specific. Maybe they would charge some fee to do so.
Of course that's assuming only one active channel, and you may have more than one channel.
@_date: 2018-07-01 21:04:04
Well you said that percentage of users who run nodes was how decentralization was measured...  according to whom?
If there are 2 users and both run a validating node, is this less centralized than an alternative with 100,000 users and 50,000 validating nodes?
I would argue that the 2 user 2 node system is less decentralized. In that system, it would be relatively trivial to break such a system.
I'm just trying to point out that it is not the only way to measure decentralization, and as a result, when you try to optimize a system on a biased metric, you can improve the *metric*, but possibly harm the intent of said metric.
@_date: 2018-07-01 05:10:47
Liquidity isn't enough. It's also the *bias* of the liquidity. For example:
All channels have 100 in them in terms of liquidity. But if A wants to pay D $2, they can't. They are restricted by channel B-C, which can only shift $1 toward C.
A can only pay D up to $1.
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:54:21
What central authority decided that is how it is measured? ;)
Regarding the hard drive capacity measurement, you can prune the chain so you actually don't store the whole thing. This could virtually eliminate the hard drive capacity as a bottleneck. Then, it's pretty much all about bandwidth.
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:13:11
I mostly agree with what you've said, except that bigger blocks excluding more people. That is excluding more people from running validating nodes, but it *includes* many more people in the economic system. I suspect that a doubling of block size could double the number of people economically included. However, I highly doubt it would cut the number of validating nodes in half. In fact, I doubt it would make an appreciable difference. Perhaps it could even result in more validating nodes.
For example, presume doubling cuts 5% of existing validating nodes... but 10% of *new entrants* decide to run a validating node. That would actually result in an *increase* of validating nodes, rather than a decrease. For every 1 lost, 2 gained.
Eventually, this would hit a limit where you would lose more than you would gain.
Imagine if the block limit was 1% of what it was today. I suspect that would result in *less* economic activity and result in *fewer* HODLERs. It would probably result in *fewer* validating nodes.
If you are maximizing for *percentage of users running validating nodes*, then yes, the smaller the better.
However, if you're maximizing for *total number of validating nodes*, there would be some "happy medium".
Maybe it's 1MB. Maybe it's 100KB. Maybe its 10KB. Maybe it's 10MB... maybe it's 100MB.
I have seen no evidence to suggest the existing limit is the optimum to maximize *node count*.
@_date: 2018-07-01 04:46:11
In that scenario, that could be a sudden and massive spike in on-chain transactions. Ideally, traffic on chain would be at capacity, but not above or below it by any significant amount. Backlogs can cause disproportionate spikes in fees. (Which could perhaps change the game theory for the LN punishment transactions, maybe...)
@_date: 2018-07-01 15:55:44
Yes I'm aware of the relationship between block size and transactions per second.. my question was why at 4tx/s it is decentralized, but more and it would not? Say, 8tx/s.. or 16tx/s.
What makes 4tx/s so special?
It seems you're claiming that something breaks after that line... I don't understand what you're referring to.
Maybe you're referring to dial-up modems? Beyond around 4tx/s dial-up modems would have a hard time keeping up with the chain.
