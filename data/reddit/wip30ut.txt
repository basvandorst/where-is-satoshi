my bet would be that he's the fall-guy for a DoD experiment in crypto-currencies, maybe for use in 3rd world dictatorships with corrupt banking systems. Nakamoto has no source of income for years yet lives a comfortable middle-class life style in Los Angeles with its high cost of living. Something doesn't add up. It wouldn't surprise me if they're paying him to be the public face of BitCoin &amp; keep up the charade. Just remember that in the beginning Tor/Onion Routing was a Naval Research Labs experiment too.

my college roomie's dad worked at Hughes Defense as an engineer too and had classified clearance. He said his dad's scope of work included missile systems, satellite communication &amp; stealth bomber technology. And part of his security clearance prevented him (and his family) from traveling abroad to certain countries with interests non-aligned with the US.

The article said his ancestral home is in Beppu, on the southern island of Kyushu. MANY descendants of that area have bloodlines that go back to the Samurai class since Kyushu has been a stronghold for samurai clans throughout Japan's history. The area surrounding Beppu is dotted with castle towns.

well it gives new impetus for those home-invasion robberies by Azn gangsta's. Thug life baby!

buy $108 of merch at Nordstrom. Return for CASH. Use that cash to buy a Moneygram at Walmart for transfer payment to BitInstant. Problem solved. Don't use those pre-paid Visa/MC cards ever again... they're worthless unless you give them your SS and credit info.

I think the Feds are really confused on who should be regulating Bitcoin transactions, and whether it's really a currency or commodity or none of the above. Until they figure it out they're going to target the low-hanging fruit like Dwolla payments since that e-payment network interfaces with over 800 banks and credit unions.

does he actually price his services in BTC? or is it similar to a foreign debit card where it's converted from USD on the fly by a 3rd party processor/exchanger?

how secure is the Android wallet app? similar in security to Armory? 
and does the gym give you any discount or charge a premium for paying with Btc?

yes... they're one of the few retailers that let you return merch for CASH. That's why their prices are so freakin high &amp; sales rare. My family always gives gifts to casual acquaintances from Nordstrom just because of their liberal return policy. Make sure to get a gift receipt for easy returns.

in the not-so-distant future, BTC could rival or surpass Visa/MC credit account systems for easy payments &amp; receipt of small charges. Most likely very large transactions like real estate sales or private business buyouts will still be settled in fiat since the sellers would want the buyers to bear the burden of exchange risk. But even then in countries with manipulated currencies or runaway hyperinflation ppl may indeed turn to BTC for settlement (in lieu of US dollars or the Euro). Once we begin to see the establishment of a strong active BTC currency exchange market involving money center banks and foreign national institutions we can only imagine the endless possibilities.

if you have a large enough profit, you probably need to file quarterly estimated tax  payments, just like with stock or mutual fund trades. Consult a CPA, since you don't want to get hit with penalties next March. And if i were you i'd separate my personal bank account from your btc account (in separate financial institutions), so if they do put any kind of hold on your account your day-to-day finances won't be affected.

The payload is written in assembly (like most shellcodes), that's why it's specific to Windows machines. This hacker de-compiled the exploit and gives a brief summary [here]( It phones home to the Feds with your IP, MAC address &amp; host name, presumably so they can cross-reference it with PRISM data and make a composite profile and try to see if you're a pedo-terrorist worth arresting.

did you try PayPal? or even just sending a money order thru snail mail? Western Union rapes you every time... it's the payment system of last resort.
The only consolation is that $28 is less than 13% drop in BTC-USD value your relative might have experienced. You can think of that 8% as the risk premium for BTC currency conversion.

they should've done this with a special AmazonFresh giftcard.

Money changers, cash-checking quick-loan centers, specifically those catering to the huge populace of undocumented workers in the US. Here on the West Coast there are a lot of hard-working Latinos who're day laborers &amp; contractors without green cards, relying on cash for payment from employers &amp; remittances to friends &amp; family back home. They all have cell phones &amp; smart phones, but don't have the papers to establish bank accounts or credit cards.

wow.... my BTC account is now worth more than what i paid for my Acura. This sh!t is crazy.

i'm just speculating but maybe with the new ID/SS requirements of BitInstant, Mt. Gox and other exchanges, black market underground traders are having a tougher time converting to fiat, and slowing sales means less demand for BTC.

given how illiquid the bitcoin market is, will the fund trade at NAV? True ETF's based on indices use a variety of hedging techniques with derivatives to prevent discounts &amp; premiums like you find in the closed-end fund market.
