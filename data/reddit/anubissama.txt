yes I noticed the TOR reference as well and again I had the feeling it was presented as this "evil" think only "evil terrorist"use - I wrote it of as well it is an anime about terrorist they will show only the aspect relevant to terrorism ok. But in this episode it was played straight. The entire scene plays out like this:






The screen shot I used in the OP just contained the most information so I put it in as most informative but it was shown only for a moment and the mood of the scene was pretty clear saying **internet currency is EVIL**.

If it where used this way this thread wouldn't exist ;) and this is exactly the fallacy of most anti-bitcoin argument. 
Every point they bring against bitcoin can be brought out against cash so in situation like this making a statement against cash isn't harmful to anyone because well we all use it and are aware of the positive and negative side of physical money. 
On the other hand if the situation touches on something relatively new in our culture like internet currency showing only the negative aspect topping it off with a little emotional manipulation is rather harmful to spreading this new idea.

thank you. English isn't my first language and spell checks don't catch such mistakes.
