My bad, thanks for the update... last time I believe anything I read on cryptotwitter!

What’s minimum hardware requirements? Could you run on zero w?

Is it true that there is only like 8 main nodes? Cryptotwitter has a sweet post about the lightning network working like tor. But everyone FUDed calling it centralized and there was never a good response.

Yeah I have been hearing about atomic swaps I will have to look into them more. 
It’s funny cause everyone thinks one crypto is going to rule them all... when in reality you will be able to use whichever you like and send the same value in whatever the receiver likes. Bitcoin is king but what a time to be alive!

People are excited �� You didn’t have to write a blogpost response about it. You didn’t even have to read it. Why are you here?

Cool that would give me something fun to do with a zero I’ve had laying around for some time. How fast is the Blockchain gonna grow/ how big of a hard drive would you wanna start with?

Nice. Yeah I have looked at that graph and it doesn’t appear to be that centralized to me. For the early days at least like you say. With how fast it is growing...
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:57:07
Sweet, I did not realize. How is it working so far?

If lightning network ever gets released...

How long did it end up taking?

Where do you buy said coins? LBC too high for me.
