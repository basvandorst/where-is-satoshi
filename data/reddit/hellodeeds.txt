I'm just sympathizing with OP. I'm super new to Bitcoin just saw his post and can relate. My husband and I were fucked by PayPal and I was relating that. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 03:20:18
I feel your pain. PayPal fucked me over close to 8 years ago when someone hacked my eBay account and transferred a ton of money. Never got back my 2k. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:12:40
My bank wasn't involved because it was a paypal balance. It was awful. I refuse to do business with them or eBay. (Not that they notice or care)

i'm new to bitcoin so pardon the ignorant question: since bitcoin fluctuates a lot more than gov backed currency, how would you know when to pay your bill to get most bang out of your cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:49:14
Happy Tuesday!
My Bitcoin knowledge grows with all of your posts. My sincerest thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:44:35
how do you find new charities and businesses that take bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:24:09
Happy Tuesday!!
