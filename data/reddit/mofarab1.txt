Yup! You have to to off set your average consumption. Call your solar company and see if they can add. (They can)

Yea they had identical plans because its based on roof space. Cant install over vents , pipes, or have any trees that hinder production. Lol and if the only viable install space Is lets say east facing (less production) then the sales rep will SELL you on the value if converting your home to solar for zero -little upfront cost. Any solar is better than no solar they say. Which is true In a sense. Doing a summers energy bill was a mistake because the production will vary year round give or take 10% reduction  in the panels efficiency year over year.

There are many factors to consider and you are referring to the direction your roof faces in correlation with array design space. Ideally south facing roofs in the Western Hemisphere is ideal sometimes west. Payment plan / understanding your “savings” vary and typically you are given a site survey, estimated production and YOU SHOULD of compared it to your average 12 month energy usage. ANY savings at all is good for converting your home to solar with zero- little out of pocket cost. Since you converted your home to solar for environmental reasons I assume you DIDNT do the comparisons, looked at your production vs consumption ratio and it really depends on your utility company. Solar companies typically show a design and its up to the buyer to do their own research. You saw that you can covert your house for free upfront and you jumped on it. Any savings is great and you gotta separate principle cost of the pv design and install with what your utility costs post solar.
