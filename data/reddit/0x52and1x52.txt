I mean if we’re comparing Litecoin vs Bitcoin, Bitcoin is definitely the shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:49:15


Ah, so now I’m sure you’re stupid. LTC is much better established, is faster, and has non-shady people behind it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:43:21
I can’t tell if you’re trolling or not because they work extremely well for Litecoin. Perhaps you’re just stupid? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:49:38
As a seller AND buyer on eBay, this is simply not true. eBay definitely has its niche for sellers and buyers.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:41:36
I wouldn’t consider 2 hours fast but it’s certainly better. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:26:19
That is a horrible analogy.
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:47:15
Twitter actually recently started being profitable.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:52:35
and 100 times longer!
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:19:46
Then maybe Litecoin should be the only payment method accepted. Bitcoin is way too slow for this to even be feasible. Also, I mentioned atomic swaps exactly because of the whole popularity thing. People will buy one coin but be able to use the other anyways.
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:34:21
They're not going through use an extremely unstable online token to allow purchasing services in an extremely valuable company. You guys can say "to the moon!" all you want but the moon is what's keeping Bitcoin from being used as an actual currency. Businesses can't risk using an unstable currency on such a large scale. Until Bitcoin figures out what price it wants to sit at, it won't be used by large comoanies like that.
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:39:37
Yeah I sent myself LTC to my Loafwallet yesterday and it was extremely quick(like 30 seconds) and the fee wasn't much at all.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:52:02
Yeah, I forgot how I had to pay $5 to send $1 using PayPal last week... oh wait.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:55:51
don't u ever say Kanye and shit in the same sentence ever again
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:18:43
Yeah, and then a new, quicker, and better way came out which used the same concept and everyone abandoned the old way of connecting to the internet. (not talking about shit BCH)
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:03:12
why no litecoin? once atomic swaps are enabled it will be way better to accept that.
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:08:30
Not going to happen, BCH won't ever get Atomic Swaps with Bitcoin while Litecoin will. Litecoin is Bitcoin's silver, not Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:27:24
No, it's from people with common sense. Why the hell should I pay such a high fee. The only shills I've seen here are people like you who think the fees shouldn't be complained about.
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:39:24
OK so then what is the point of Bitcoin then? Also, large companies aren't going to trust Coinbase, they're going to want to do it themselves.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:24:12
From what I understand it was like a Superman S.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:16:10
And what exactly would they be convicted of? Crypto currency isn’t as disruptive as it could be right now, it’s really only an asset at this point, not something people use on the daily for purchasing things. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:56:11
I’d love to see the government try to tax me for capital gains on crypto currencies. How would they even know?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:13:30
That isn’t really relevant to Bitcoin at all lmao. I don’t care about BCH at all but it’s stupid to dig up shit on someone(as long as they didn’t intentionally harm or abuse anyone) from 15 years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:39:37
I know you’re joking but would they? Like would a capacitive touch screen not work on the moon and would the IR dot projector not be able to be read?
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:08:40
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:53:23
what does that say? it just shows *s for me.
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:11:39
Yeah I’ve done that as well. That is definitely report worthy, Bitcoin isn’t represented by them at all, incredibly misleading.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:29:53
I'd argue the opposite. Android doesn't have as many power-user gestures or features when compared to iOS. Sure, you have multi-task windows but if you're invested into the Apple ecosystem, you're going to be able to be way more efficient with you work. With 3d touch, continuity across devices, and great RAM management, you get insane productivity with what you have.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:36:24
Its price is 100x more stable than Bitcoin's. It can actually work well as a currency unlike Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:32:06


lol that is not Bitcoin at all
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:36:06
I mean with most Android phones, you seriously don't own it. They can disable the phone forcefully forever if they want(see Note 7).
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:49:29
iOS updates are never forced even if security ones(ex. x.x.1). They can be very pesky and tell you to update but it's never forced.
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:30:05
Or asking what are the advantages of Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-09-07 07:11:55
LTC is supposed to be BTC's silver since BTC has stupid high fees and long ass confirmation times. Charlie even said he wants Litecoin to work with Bitcoin in his CNBC interview.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:42:44
The fact that they were even able to force it down the user's throats is the issue.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:35:05
More like minutes lmao. 2d facial recognition is easily fooled by a picture.
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:06:06
30 years I’m going to say Bitcoin is going to be worth nothing or a ton.
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:10:02
No LTC? ETH isn't really a viable currency so it's surprising that's on there but no LTC.
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:33:37
Pretty sure the alts have all of those. What’s funny is Bitcoin doesn’t have a few of those on that list lol.
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:50:46
I’m probably misunderstanding what you’re saying but yes, that’s called money laundering.
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:15:51
[I love Twitter.]( I didn’t even know that people were mass reporting this account but it was extremely obvious they were parading around as “the Bitcoin”, something that is literally impersonation. Glad to see Twitter actually does stuff about it on their platform. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:57:53
From what I was perceiving, he was proposing that they have an income from an illegitimate source and just mark it off as coming from “t-shirt sales”.
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:18:32
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:08:48
Oh and what did Bush do? 
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:59:22
Of course it can be used for that but my point still stands. The whole reason crytpocurenncy even has value at all is because of fiats. How would you even measure the value without fiats? You can't. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:26:03
Yeah! Fuck Obama and his wife for trying to make America a better place and actually setting a healthcare plan up! 
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:23:03
I don't even read or watch CNN lmao.
@_date: 2017-07-05 06:51:10
I know this is the Bitcoin sub but could anyone give me some insight about how the hard fork will effect other crytpocurenncies?
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:08:41
I'm going to say that never happens. We don't have a proper way of figuring out if we kill a conscious brain and just create another one just like it. There is no way to tell.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:59:13
Giphy is the worst gif service it doesn't work on mobile at all. I hate you I wanted to see that ��
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:21:19
Good point.
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:11:09
I kinda agree but I honestly think Sanders genuinely cared about people and their well being. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:08:00
I know you’re joking but fiats will always be a thing whether you like it or not. Crypto currencies have no value without fiats.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:16:50
Yeah you're right it's not like they tried helping kids by giving healthier school lunches, right?
