Your suggestion sounds good and i have heard often.  In my mind i cant define space, maybe elaborate on how this would enhance the definition.... does space really add anything to the definition?

Couldn't sleep for a month.      
Economic tide change and the few here are privileged enough to  have a front row seat via Bitcoin

wow, never would believe that I could put so much thought into one word.  I agree with you in every aspect,   For arguments sake and consideration only, Bitcoin exists without space, so could this addition mislead the reader, while also promoting the "glossy-eyed" effect?

I thought about this a long time, spent a while putting my thoughts together a little while back;

Lets look at this another way,  I have 10 easy math problems on a table to solve, anybody can  work on solving them, and the choice is yours as to which one to work on.  However, math problem 4 of 10 has a bit of an incentive, because the first person to solve it gets a $10.00 bill.   Wherein  the other math problems pay nothing.  Which do you choose to work on?  This fee is by design, and is quite brilliant. Yes maybe it could be presented differently. Maybe call it "Incentive to process my transaction first fee".

Lets face it, Google is in the advertising business, any bitcoin integration between Google's android phone and/or Browser/Devices allow the company to target advertise to its users simply by tracking the purchase flow of goods on the blockchain tied to its devices.  Retailers can easily be matched by thier BTC payment addresses, this builds demographic for advertising.   Assuming Google can create a match between Device and BTC address via. agreement TOS they have a winner.     seems easy to me. 
Targeted advertising &amp; Search = Revenue = Google's goal. I cannot imagine any reason they would pass this opportunity to enhance Search.   Apple's attitude toward bitcoin is icing on the cake.  Should be a No brainer.

I  would also push the marketing aspect,  in addition to  all the economic issues as posted above me,  being the forefront of technology in commerce will provide the early adopters/companies a "no cost" global marketing opportunity, eg. how many times have you heard Ostock or TDirect in the news over the past month?  
I wrote up my top 10 the other day from a users prospective:

Hey Zulban,  you make a valid point.  grammar edit complete. :)

Rewind a year.   i just finished buying some btc, price was over 200 was climbing fast, I didn't really have any extra $$, but i was able to find a method to purchase some. A  month or so later, the price was 60-80 and price movement was grinding down...how depressing.  Looking back would you say that was a bad decision?  How is it any different today?  To be honest,  I consider Bitcoin the  21 century "land grab", there is no question in my mind. This affects our entire planet, and will rewrite commerce history, redefining our international trade. The recent China events are only a ripple in a tidal wave...
Now, i have to go buy some more tomorrow, and i have to drive several hours to do it. Thanks redditors!

Just when you have thought you'd seen it all. 
TV on demand comes out PayPerView QR.  It matches your Register Bitcoin Public QR Code to your TV / PC  and allows for verified paid streaming content. 
Really.. I can just scan the TV to pay for a show....  sweet

I foresee payment request QR's embedded in emailed  or texted statements.

Tickets and entrance fees can be scanned and purchased via youtube video, bill board, poster or TV commercial, or text message.   So long as  you prove you have the purchase transaction.. VIOLA YOUR IN, goodbye handheld printouts and tickets.  Paperless is closer than you think.
