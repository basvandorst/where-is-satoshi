Nice.  Ill just stick with ledger.  I would hate to lose my bitcoin just so I can make an interest payment.  Too risky.  Thank you!

That is great! Fun!

It sure does!  Ill check it out but in the meantime Im sticking with ledger.

Yeah it is better then nothing!  
Well I have been looking and so far the only thing that I have found is crypto.com.  They have a cc that supposedly pays back.  But it looks like they use their own coin MCO.  And that coin varies in value daily.  So I would hate to be using a coin that drops in value by 50% just to get 5% cash back or whatever.  I don't quite understand their model yet but I am checking it out.

If it turns out he does have access to 1.1 million BTC, how will that affect the future of BTC?   If the a\*\*hat proves he is Satoshi or at least part of the team that created BTC, he will continue to bash BTC and promote BSV.  He is proven that he cares only for himself.  There is no way that BTC goes down and BSV goes up correct?

Oh yeah...then there is that!!!!  Ugh!  Same thing with altcoins?  So far I have only bought for the last year.

That is so true!  It would be nice if the a**hat would quit bashing his supposed creation.  It really annoys me about all of this illegal activity that bitcoin is used for. Cash is king when it comes to drugs.  It has been for a millennia.

Yeah not worth it to pay 4%.  
So far all I have done is buy and hold bitcoin.  Last year I did buy altcoins with the BTC but all those altcoins are worth 50% or less now.  Maybe IRS owes me :)

Yeah I suppose it is still early in the adoption to be cheap and competitive. Thank you for your insight.

Good to see Bloomberg discussing Bitcoin!  I just don't see why some people are so negative about it.  Transfer of wealth must be the source of fear?

The best thing would be to deposit BTC, borrow against it. Pay it back and get 3-5% cash back.  Guess it doesnt exist yet.
