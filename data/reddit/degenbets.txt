That's what I was doing instead of mining bitcoin in 2010 :(

They could just respond with "we're banning it anyways".

MDMA is nice

Why in the world do ppl think these coins are lost? For someone smart enough to create bitcoin and keep their privacy I have to think they still have access.

It's called crypto**currency**

How? I'm not a BCH fan but he has been outrageously pro bitcoin and helped it along in the early days.

My ACH limit is 100k on Gemini and 10k on GDAX. I haven't asked for increases or anything.

I support core but the fact is blocks ARE full. Saying legitimate users don't fill up the blocks is discounting the reality that there are other transactions filling the rest of the blocks up.

Bitcoin doesn't close though so there may not be a desire to do that.

Most markets close for the weekend though.

$10k moon is subjective. It's will certainly be a milestone, but hardly what I would consider the moon.

BFX needs every cent they can get. They should be offering at least 50%.

Yeah I think it's Terrible news. Wall street with their endless money could decimate the price indefinitely

Maybe they've been getting away with it and just finally got caught this time?

If I would have dug into bitcoin and found a reputable site, I would have invested the $3k I had in 2010 which would be $409m now. People forget how shady shit was back then. The whole thing gave off a very scammy vibe honestly.

They stopped fiat withdrawals 10 months before the collapse. They weren't even an exchange at that point imo.

If I know how much I started 2017 with and I sold everything at the end of 2017, can I just report my net profit or do I really have to report every single trade?
