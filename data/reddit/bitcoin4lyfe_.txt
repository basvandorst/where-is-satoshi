It's a bunch of trolls who think they can centralize bitcoin by electing a president of bitcoin!

Yes! Once we have destroyed the BTU movement we can get on with activating segwit and going to the moon!

Lol, don't believe the propaganda, a hard fork is impossible and will never happen. This subreddit needs to ban more trolls who talk about dangerous hard forks.

Yes! Rodger VER was bought out by the Chinese government a long time ago!!

There were too many alt coin pumpers sponsored by Troll Ver and Jihad Wu posting in here trying to crash bitcoin and pump their scamcoin investments. Theymos and his team do a good job of keeping the trolls at bay.

It's been proven, look it up.

I wonder if the COMMUNIST chinese government taught Roger how to write code when they were brainwashing him into making BUCoin!
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:34:44
Do they teach C++ in EXPLOSIVES school? hahahaha

Because they want to DESTROY bitcoin

Rodger Ver is in bed with the communist government and Jihad Wu.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:40:20
So now Rodger VER is using his communist blood money to pay for obvious propaganda videos like this?

yeah, of course they turn on the charm factor when you give them an olive branch. just like the venis fly trap attracts its victims before brutally eating them. watch out OP, they are trying to trick you into supporting Rodger and Jihan's evil takeover attempt of bitcoin
