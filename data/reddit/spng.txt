I was about to suggest this. I have been looking at Go (golang.com) and I think it would be perfect for this type of project.

This recently happened to me, and well I was not happy about it either. I reached out to  on twitter, and submitted a support request. It was taken care of in 2 days, and they honored the orignal purchase price. Here is their response e-mail:

Sorry about that! After manually reviewing your account I've whitelisted it so you shouldn't experience any additional issues going forward. I've also pushed through the transaction that was canceled previously (at the original exchange rate you locked in), so you should have those coins by the end of tomorrow. In addition, we recently wrote a blog post about this you might find interesting: 
Hope it helps and sorry again for the trouble!
I just received the coins, and at the original price I had locked in. I think the main issue with Coinbase right now is the demand outweighs their available human resources. The market is obviously hot and they are doing everything they can to keep up with demand.

I was at the BitcoinATM event yesterday in San Diego. I think "cheaper fees" is not correct. Evan suggested that BitcoinATM is planning on taking a 3% transaction fee in to and out of BTC. The operator makes their money with a fee above this amount. He suggested the operator will probably charge another 2% each way for a grand total of 5% each way. 10% round trip transaction fee is pretty undesirable if you ask me.

Why are there so many MTG references in the bitcoin community?

This is correct. I saw Buffet speak at a Berkshire shareholder meeting a few years ago. He does not invest in startups or dabble much in new technology. His investment focus is established companies with good management and offering the owners a way to monetize a portion of their equity interest.

I'm going to be visiting Buenos Aires the beginning of August. Looking at this chart I'm a bit confused. The Blue dollar rate is about about 8.110 ( but this article shows it at 10.5. Where is the exchange rate for BTC to Peso?

I had an order slated to go through yesterday and it was canceled at the last minute, the same way the customer described in the blog post. It was for 3 BTC, hardly a high value transaction, and was my first test using coinbase. I have submitted a ticket and sent them a tweet, but no response yet. I'm sure they will review it soon, but it is unfortunate, especially since the price has now increased.

I started using this service about a month ago. Seems to be working great, though I have yet to make a withdraw.
