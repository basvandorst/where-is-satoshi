You are missing the fact that for a third party hoping to make a serious buck on shorting BTC it's 100% net positive move. Say, I have access to this hashing power through illicit means (hacking, gun to the owner's head etc) and open a few massive short positions on a number of exchanges (read up on how short works)..  I than flip the boom switch and send BTC value tumbling down. I close my short at the very bottom having made Millions in the process. Not to mention amounts to be had by double-spending your transactions.. this is definitely a win move for any rogue entity who could care less about BTC's longevity over personal gain.

Seems like childish attempt at dealing with the issue by suppressing access to the information, and article in particular. Just let people read and form their own opinions. Geez
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:10:29
Having said all that.. look at BTCe and volume of new account registrations they are getting post GOX collapse. People don't seem to have slightest care that the exchange is ran by an anonymous entity, and by the looks of it on very shoddy code (judging also by their underwhelming website). So what if the owners of this exchange fold and leave with the coins? We'll be back to the same argument and cries of anguish and anger. Some people just never do learn.

What idiot would acquire a rotten brand?

Jesus christ can you people stop sawing false sense of comfort regarding Gox? It's gone, coins are gone! There's no "reading between the lines"... they've screwed up big

For example, next to the phone# field, have optional "News Alert" keywords field where I can enter a keyword or two for news alerts. E.g.:
News Alert on "Huobi"

I fail to understand how this is good news? Literally half of the available funding options were removed (one of the two) and this smells like LiLin is having seconds thoughts about using his personal account for those transfers after all. To me this sounds precisely like bad news.

Ultimately, It's the job of the money holder to guarantee the safety of his funds. If they trust the business with their money, and the business runs away with those funds, well then that's just that and we'd hope that people didn't trust the business with their life savings. 
It would be nice to have 3rd party oversight of major exchanges, but ultimately it's your job to make sure you are not being swindled out of your life savings.

Yet he only owns less than a single bitcoin himself. Not a glowing endorsement by far. 
Of course, people who had invested in shovels during the gold rush made the most money. He's obviously intelligent enough to have figured this out on his own. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:34:54
If one does it'd be a monumental idiot for bidding on a rotten brand. Better off starting own exchange from scratch. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:52:33
I certainly do not intend to burst anybody's bubble but we are talking about mere pittance compared to the total amount of funds lost.. some 200btc vs 850k btc. Lets keep everything in perspective please before we rally another hype and trip over each other to a buying frenzy only to loose more btc in subsequent sell-off. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:06:34
"All of these statements, however true, are quite disgusting" - I'd disagree with you (or at least the statement you are trying to make, not your overall sentiment) statements like "haha it's a good thing gox is dead" are hardly true at all. And just underscores overall infantile attitude towards Bitcoin. While touting 0 transaction fees people fail to appreciate the true cost of business when factoring in security and liability. They fail to understand that for wider Bitcoin adoption security, speed of transactions, and reliability of underlying financial systems are paramount above all else.

well 740k worth of bitcoins were voted in for Gox.. how did that turn out?
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:40:12
Could be someone you know? Somebody close? Not very likely with such small sum for an incentive but still..

No. it's a sign you know much less than he does. The dude has earned a record 30% per share for his Berkshire empire. Investors pay him $50k / hr to listen to him talk. I'd rather listen to him than random reddit bitcoin aficionado. He knows his stuff.

Well at least now you can have only at most 1BTC stolen from you.

You are much more likely to loose your coins stored locally on your computer than on a web wallet simply because there are many more viruses and all manner of malware circulating on desktops. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:28:26
precisely :)
in that instance there'll still be a little money to make for the rest of us jumping in on another bull run to the moon, this time from the very bottom

He's screaming the transactions are traceable but in fact no they are not.. otherwise the thieves would long have all been caught by now. Which is obviously not the case. So whereas transactions are "sort-of" traceable it is still quite trivial for a thief to cover his tracks. And with the centralized exchanges, and mining pools, it is equally trivial to ddos the shit out of the network and if not outright swipe balances at least spread so much panic as to drive prices down thereby enabling the perpetrator to make a good sum of money on the price move alone!

Sorry I aught to clarify.. the exchange to / from BTC &lt;-&gt; Yuan is banned. Which is as close to a ban as you can get from a purely financial stand point.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:10:33
Pretty foolish of him to attempt to do this in the face of an outright ban by one of the most authoritarian governments on the planet. I personally wouldn't want to chance it!

Interesting read. I'm curious what price level the BTC will settle at once Chinese exit the trading floor by the mandatory end of Jan, 2014 deadline (the Chinese New Year mark as set by their bank). 
Is it going to be in the $150 range as the natural trajectory (not the exponential one) would seem to indicate?
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:56:37
Mark me as a fool, but I just cannot see a way for BTCChina to continue past the hard deadline of Jan/2014 for all withdrawals to cease as set out by the Chinese Bank. 
What is more surprising is that the Chinese have yet to stampede to the exit door.. OKCoin and BTCChina exchanges still have over 40% of all Bitcoins on the market.. 
If you held Bitcoins in China, at what point would you consider cashing out to avoid loosing all your funds? Or is there a possiblity of simply transferring those bitcoins to a USD based exchange and wiring proceeds back to the mainland China?
In either case, if money's not allowed to flow in and out of an exchange than what's the point of that exchange? How could it possibly hope to survive? I don't quite get it.. maybe Bobby is just blowing smoke there..

Also due to the fact that Windows based OSes occupy a larger user share %wise, hackers out there focus nearly exclusively on finding and exploiting holes in the system. I too keep my wallet backed up on google cloud, encrypted, with a super long passkey that i'll remember for centuries and is comprised of string sequences not used in any of my other online passwords. I also use 2FA everywhere possible.
