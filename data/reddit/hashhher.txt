Upvoted because this might be the best way to find out if GAW is actually mining in that warehouse.

I read the post. It was very respectful. Feel free to dig it up if you'd like. It might be hard though considering GAW has deleted it along with everything else on Hashtalk that could've drawn attention to their scam.

He also claims to have mysterious partnerships which allow him to rent hashpower at way above the market rate. The last couple days people have been complaining about the abysmal mining payouts. This morning Josh tweeted "Good to see our hashing power being rented again" as though he just flips a switch on profitability when PR starts to get bad.
There don't appear to have been any major hashrate changes which would have resulted from a shift in hashpower within the Scrypt or SHA-256 mining networks.

There is no prerequisite that "you need to have lost a bunch of your money" before an investigation can begin.
It sounds like you read Josh's post though. Josh Garza publicly tried to convince people to not go through with reporting him. He says that ["None of these agencies will do anything"]( because nobody has "lost money." Aside from the fact that he's completely wrong about how the SEC [investigates](
) companies, many people *have* lost money, and many many more of them are being strung along with ever increasing promises that they'll be paid eventually even though all the signs say otherwise.
The SEC has taken down Bitcoin-based Ponzi schemes before, and I'm sure they'll be happy to take this one down too.

Look at Josh's twitter followers:
Almost all of them are obvious fake accounts. Josh wants so badly for people to think he's legit that he buys fake followers, has been caught making fake Reddit and Bitcointalk posts, has been caught making fake claims about partnerships, and makes fake statements about the profitabilty of his investment products. Is it really that far fetched to assume that he's running a fake mining operation too?

It's the opposite of Dogecoin. Dogecoin started as a joke but became so popular that people took it seriously. Paycoin's creators are super serious about it, but it's so bad that everyone else just sees it as a joke.

The guy who started MiningAdvocates.org spent over $10,000 with GAW, only to be banned for (respectfully) questioning why he was being charged $1000 a month in fees. Let that sink in...
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:06:28
Just a subtle point here. Your letter doesn't include the question mark in the article title "Gaw Miners lying about partnerships?" That question mark is important because even if GAW had been telling the truth, (and they weren't) it's not libel to ask a question.
It's generally bad reporting to ask impicative questions with no evidence behind them. (An example would be: Does Josh Garza murder babies?) But in this case, Josh has said on camera "it won't be long before you'll walk into Target and see Hashlets. It won't be long before you go on Walmart.com... We're working with the largest etailers in the country." And then in his ICO announcement, "We are working with some of the largest brands in the world." and then proceeded to mention Target, Walmart, Amazon, and Macys two sentences later. Josh strongly implied that he was working with those companies to the point that the average person would consider it to be lying. Even users on Hashtalk seemed surprised and disappointed when they found out that there weren't actually any partnerships.
I don't want the debate on GAW to become too focused on anyone's specific wording because I think it diverts attention from the the massive scam that is still going on. However, the main things that I've gotten out of the "partnership/coinfire" issue are that: 
A) Josh is willing to significantly bend the truth to make his company sound more successful than it is. I could probably think of 10-15 other things that he's said or done to make his company look successful but in reality are flat out false or deceptive.
B) Josh is willing to do whatever it takes to shut people up when they're speaking out about him. He is very quick to threaten legal action and call people liars when they question him, even though they are asking important and valid questions. Meanwhile he's been caught lying himself, [posting under fake accounts](  in attempts to shut people up and give himself more credibility.

We need this. Most news sources to have written about GAW are either paid affiliates or have received gifts from GAW. Josh Garza has been fairly effective at the muting the growing number of people who disagree with what he's doing. It's been three months since people were complaining that [Coindesk was deleting comments]( that questioned the validity of their articles about GAW. When when somebody (Coinfire) finally stepped up and started asking real questions, Josh Garza attacked them, their website was hacked, and Josh threatened them with baseless lawsuits.

Thank you for posting this. You've thoughtfully and articulately summed up the message that I've been trying get out over the last couple weeks. (with several accounts since GAW keeps banning me) At this point there are just too many red flags for this company to continue without a serious investigation.
When I first started researching GAW Miners, I thought that they were sitting on a pile of cash, and had more money than they knew what to do with. At one point they had stated that they'd done $10M in sales in a month and thought they might hit $100M for the year.
But just after looking at publicly available information, GAW has dozens of employees, paid $1.1M for a domain name, allegedly paid $8M for their stake in Zenminer, supposedly runs three(?) datacenters and their offices, takes private jet trips, and pays all of the other costs that pop up while running a business.
They've been burning through cash, but meanwhile ever since the initial Hashlet launch, their sales [appear to be in rapid decline]( According to Alexa, GAW's website traffic is the lowest it's been since their site launched in April. I don't see any way that GAW's low volume partner sites can make up for GAWMiners.com's decline in sales, and while Zenminer's traffic is strong, it's primarily a portal for existing customers.
I originally thought that GAW was intentionally defrauding customers and sitting on a goldmine of ill-gotten profits. Now I actually just think that they're running out of money. 
This is all speculative, but after seeing the estimates of GAW's website traffic, beyond the initial Hashlet launch, GAW's customers are just not spending money in the same volume anymore. It's very plausible that GAW envisioned themselves as having massive growth, so they made huge promises to their customers with the assumption that later sales would make up for the losses. Since that growth hasn't materialized, GAW's been forced to dramatically raise fees, lower prices, encourage users to reinvest, and of course rush out their Hashcoin as a last ditch effort to raise funds.
Whether or not all of that is true remains to be seen, but if GAW's sales are down and they're trying to make up for previously promised returns by paying older customers with funds from new customers, that is by definition a Ponzi scheme. It is a provable fact that GAW's fees, marketplace sales, and now Hashcoins are are all ways that GAW gives older customers advantageous returns at the expense of new customers.
* Newer customers pay a much higher percentage in fees than older customers have.
* Older customers sell their Hashlets to newer customers in their marketplace. (and GAW takes a 20% cut.) The very first buyers bought in for $16 per Hashlet and could sell for $50+ to profit at the expense of newer customers.
* Older customers are given opportunities to mine GAW's "Hashcoin" that newer customers will not have without paying a premium.
Whether that transfer of wealth alone constitutes a Ponzi scheme isn't something that I'm clear on, but there are plenty of other things going on in the background that just don't seem right. I don't see any way that all of this is sustainable, and unfortunately if they go under it will be their customers who suffer. 
Josh Garza may have once had a desire to create a legitimate business out of GAW, but greed and delusion seem to have set in, and he and his team need to be held accountable. Even if GAW is somehow found innocent, they absolutely need to be investigated for investment fraud and the Ponzi scheme that they appear to be running.

Hey look: more [proof](
Yeah, cloud mining bought me so that I would repeatedly tell people not to buy in to any cloud mining. Great logic.
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:19:29
Most other mining companies aren't based in the US, so your question doesn't really make sense. 
GAW is also very unique in the way that they operate. It's hard to even call them a mining company at this point. Their strategy revolves more around using aggressive tactics to sell speculative cryptocurrency-related investment products which don't have any intrinsic value beyond what they're able to convince people of in their marketing.

I'm guessing that CoinDesk will just give them the award since they've clearly been bought by GAW:
@_date: 2014-12-23 04:26:55
Considering that GAW isn't exactly participating in the mining industry anymore, it's safe to say that their "protecting trade secrets" excuse is no longer valid. GAW has had plenty of opportunities to show any evidence that they were providing the product that they were selling, and yet they have continually avoided the issue.
At this point it is safe to conclude that GAW is not, and has never been mining in connection with their cloud mining product. And if GAW was never mining, why have they charged their Hashlet owners exorbitantly high "maintenance" fees on their hashpower?
This matters tremendously not just because it means that Hashlet owners have been stolen from, but because it is proof that GAW is funding their artificial Paycoin pump with money scammed out of his cloud mining investors. Josh Garza has confessed to daytrading with his customer's funds before (breaking securities laws,) but with Paycoin he is making an all or nothing bet with his Hashlet Ponzi's customer's assets, and threatening the reputation of Bitcoin at the same time.
When Paycoin implodes (and it will implode) the backlash against against cryptocurrency could be huge. There is now definitive proof that Josh Garza has lied to his customers, fraudulently sold his pseudo investment products, fraudulently misrepresented those products, and fraudulently sold unregistered securities. He needs to be stopped before more damage is done.

The GAW scam has gone on for long enough. Let's shut it down before it gets even bigger. Here are some things that everyone can do:
1) Actively post and upvote/downvote posts regarding GAW. Users of GAW's Hashtalk forum are trying to [manipulate the conversation]( about GAW. Most of these users are victims of the very scam that they're promoting.
2) Contact the media. GAW is trying to create a "media blitz" to lure the masses into their scam. If they are successful, the end result could be a huge blow of negativity toward Bitcoin. GAW claims to have already recorded interviews with CNN, The Wall Street Journal, and Fortune. (among others) Let these organizations know that GAW is running a known scam, and that their actions do not represent cryptocurrency as a whole.

That's not the issue. Lawyers shouldn't be representing both the victims and defendants of the same crime. It is a huge conflict of interest for him to be representing Bitcoin as a whole while supporting a company which is both trying (poorly) to create a Bitcoin competitor, but more importantly has the potential to severely damage Bitcoin's reputation once it's Ponzi scheme inevitably collapses.

Ok here's one for you. (Note that I don't want any Bitcoin... I just want to to see GAW stop scamming people.) It's interesting to read because it illustrates Josh Garza's character before GAW ever took off. Basically, a couple sold Josh Garza a mining rig. He then wanted the couple to work for him (building mining rigs) for free in exchange for shares in his company. The couple told him that they needed some money up front to pay bills, and Josh got mad and ended up claiming that the miner they'd sent him was broken. An eBay dispute was filed, and the sellers posted "Has anyone here sold their own rig on eBay and encountered problems with the buyer?" on r/litecoinmining out of frustration.
Josh has deleted most of his posts, but interestingly there is a post at the bottom by "starout" who is a supposed "eBay employee" with the eBay Resolution Team. They just conveniently stumbled across this obscure post that was outing Josh as a small-time eBay scammer, and decided to create an account to in order to defend him. The "employee" breaks eBay's policies in order to defend Josh, and basically insists that Josh (the buyer) was right about everything. In the end, the sellers ended up winning the ebay claim.
Link to the post by the eBay employee who is totally not Josh Garza:
Here is the end result:

Tell that to all the people who have paid a premium for GAW's "always profitable" lifetime Bitcoin mining power with guaranteed ever-decreasing fees. They were given a choice between receiving 1 satoshi per day or accepting GAW's new Ponzicoin. Should they just stop worrying about their lost investments?
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:46:08
You could release a coin right now that has 1 Billion coins. If you premine all but one of those coins, and then sell the last remaining coin to someone else for $1, you can now claim a $1 Billion market cap. 
This is why you can't trust the market caps of premined coins, and is why Coinmarketcap.com has removed Paycoin's market cap from their website. It would be dishonest for them to say that Paycoin is in third place when the reality is simply that GAW has intentionally released an extremely limited amount of it to the public and premined the rest for themselves.
On top of that, GAW admits to buying and pumping up their own coin to artificially inflate the price. So sell that last coin out of a billion to yourself, claim the $1 Billion market cap, and now you have a more accurate picture to what GAW is doing with Paycoin.
@_date: 2014-12-09 10:25:07
You're being very generous by assuming that GAW is actually mining at anywhere near the capacity that they claim to be.
Here's another question that I haven't seen asked: Why did GAW's MH/s prices vary so wildly? Shouldn't 1 MH/s cost the same no matter which pool you point it at?

As you know, there is very available proof that GAW has lied by guaranteeing profitably in order to sell more of it's fictitious cloud miners. That's what fraud is: lying to people in order to take their money. GAW provides zero transparency about their company but there are red flags all over the place, which is why I and others want them to be investigated.
Now are you going to tell me why you're so adamant about supporting this company? (which is known to be buying Bitcoin "journalists" and pays people to go around making posts in support of them)

Wow this is straight out of Garza's mouth. No offense, but it's also the single dumbest argument that I've seen the Hashtalkers put forward. It equates to saying "We don't want the Ponzi to implode because investors will get burned, so let's keep that from happening by getting people to invest more money into it." 
Soon this entire scheme *will* collapse. The only question is how many more people can Garza sucker in?

A security is a tradable financial asset of any kind.
GAW openly claims to sell investment products, and GAW's cloud miners along with their "Paycoin" are both unregistered securities.
I agree though. The FTC should also be contacted.
@_date: 2015-01-24 07:34:04
Overall you're correct. I don't think that all of GAW's employees thought that they were working on a scam, but Hashlets were almost certainly a Ponzi. I think Garza and his higher up employees thought they could pull off the Hashlet scam to get things rolling, and the demand for Paycoin would be high enough that it would cover people's losses. Obviously that hasn't happened, but even if it had, Garza and his gang have committed multiple counts of fraud, and they need to face legal action.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:21:29

Most of the people who invested millions of dollars with Paycoin got stuck with it after they thought they had bought Bitcoin cloud miners. 
People thought they were buying actual Bitcoin mining hashpower from GAW. Instead they were given the choice to accept payment in Paycoin, or receive next to nothing (1 satoshi per day) in Bitcoin.

Nearly all cloud mining companies are scams.
@_date: 2015-01-08 06:01:45
The big difference between Paycoin and other altcoin scams is that Paycoin was funded by a massive Bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme. GAW took millions of dollars from people who only wanted to mine Bitcoins, guaranteed profitability to them, and then pretended to mine while actually paying other customer's money back to them, minus high maintenance fees. This couldn't last forever, and GAW needed a way out, so Paycoin was invented. 
For GAW, Paycoin is primarily two things: Yes, it's a way to potentially take a lot of money from people. But secondly, an attempted exit strategy from their Bitcoin "mining" Ponzi.
@_date: 2015-01-04 09:52:26


Well what do you expect? Your actions have turned you into a very public figure. ANY public figure is going to draw some disrespectful attention. In your instance, you have provably committed fraud on several counts, including fraud by your own definition. Do you just expect everyone here to just roll over and say "Haha good one josh! You really tricked us that time!" No Josh, you have stolen millions upon millions of dollars, and people are fucking mad. 
You have publicly lied repeatedly to take money from your investors. There was no physical mining behind Hashlets, there were no huge investors backing Paycoin, there were no large partnerships. You have committed fraud, and now you need to do the right thing and own up to it.
Nobody wants to use your censored cult-like forum. If you want to sway the public opinion, admit to what you've done, give a sincere apology and answer the public's questions on a public forum.
