Go onto blockchain.info and search for the address that had the money deposited to it. Very often, you'll see a note attached, which is spam; something like "sorry I lost all my money send me BTC plz!!" or whatever.

Right. Add to that the notion that selling fiat to convert to btc is itself expensive, as the market isn't infinitely liquid, and you have exchanges actually wasting money and becoming more insolvent.

Well, we're talking on IRC now, but to summarize for Reddit: I do know how outputs and etc work, but in this situation the thing I find interesting is that the Big Five (as I'll call them) addresses which each dumped a ฿30k-50k coin into the huge ฿180k transaction only ended up sending three total coins: the ฿30-50k one, the ฿0.031337 one, and the ฿0.009763 one. I don't know why they only picked those three coins. Gmaxwell thinks the 411 thing is probably a red herring and I tend to agree after hearing his reasoning. I still don't know why they only picked those three coins though - Gmaxwell suggests some sort of manual test.

Of course nobody thinks this addresses the fiat side of the equation...
The specific point I'm making is as follows: if exchanges only implement this scheme, and if they don't ALSO implement some kind of third-party audit of fiats, then the net result is worse than if they had done neither. This is because of the system of incentives I outlined in the OP.
I'm going to edit the OP to make it clearer that I'm not just saying "lol, auditing BTC doesn't audit fiat."

Who's playing semantic games? Tell you what, you win, Bitcoin isn't technically money. I will come up with a new word for Bitcoin: from here in out, Bitcoin is "shmoney." People keep finding ways that shmoney adds value to the marketplace, so now there's a rapidly-growing economy of shmoney services. The world can't get enough shmoney right now! Shmoney is going nuts.
Of course, since you're wholly unconcerned with semantics, it doesn't matter to you if we call it money, or shmoney... or toothpaste. Hooray, semantic problems defeated! Long live shmoney.

This math doesn't work. You're comparing units of "dollars per year" (annual international remittance) to "dollars" (value of Bitcoin).
You're saying that if 1% of international remittances were in BTC, then we'd see $7,000,000,000 in BTC remittance transactions per year. That has nothing to do with the price of bitcoin at all.

This is a scheme that's being proposed to prove, trustlessly, that a certain service has your money. There are plenty of services that would benefit from having this sort of scheme implemented. Additionally, there exists a different set of services that completely defeat this protocol and render it completely useless. A Bitcoin exchange holding enormous quantities of fiat is in that second set.
The flaw is in thinking that you can apply a protocol which can't prove USD reserves to the one type of service in existence which depends on having a giant pool of USD reserves - an exchange. Go apply it to something else.
There's this thought that "oh yeah, well that's a downside, but whatever, this is still better than nothing" - no, it isn't, for the reasons I advocated in the OP.

I understand the math behind this scheme, but I think there's an enormous and fatal hole in it. Specifically, there's nothing stopping a fraudulent exchange from temporarily stealing fiat from customers to cover lost or stolen BTC. In the event that BTC is stolen, a fraudulent exchange could steal fiat from their own reserves, purchase BTC with it and put it in their wallet to make sure the Merkle tree still adds up, and then sweep the accounting discrepancy under the rug on the fiat side. Since fiat holdings can't be audited as transparently and the process instead depends on trust, we're back to square one.
So for instance, say a fraudulent exchange has $50,000,000 and ฿100,000 worth of user deposits in the bank, and say that all ฿100,000 are leaked away because their code uses a buggy custom bitcoind implementation written in the Logo programming language. If the exchange rate is $500, then the exchange will simply take the $50,000,000, buy ฿100,000 from wherever with it, put it in their wallet for all to see, and continue to proclaim that everything is fine. The Merkle tree will still add up, the wallet will have the balance it should, and everything will look great. And just to make a token effort, once a year the exchange will kidnap Roger Ver and have him attest that they also have all of the fiat they should, and everyone will be quite well pleased by all this song and dance, blissfully unaware that their money has been leaked away by the Logo turtle.
Since there's no way at all to trustlessly audit fiat that I can determine, it's still rather easy for an exchange to fraudulently do fractional reserve even with your scheme in place. Furthermore, I think a real argument can be made that this hole is so important that this system shouldn't be advanced as a solution to the problem, because it ends lulling people into a false sense of security.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:19:41
I'm not sure I understand your objection.
The point I'm making is that exchanges have two huge pools of reserves that we want to be full: fiat, and BTC. No non-illusory benefit is given by proving that the BTC reserves, and only the BTC reserves, are full, so long as that second pool still exists and can float as need be.
If BTC are ever stolen, causing the BTC reserves to go fractional, the public can be led into a false sense of security by the exchange stealing from their own USD reserves to cover the shortfall. So now BTC reserves are full, and everyone thinks that everything is great due to the Merkle tree appearing to add up, but in reality, fiat reserves are now hopelessly depleted. You end up with a situation where fiat withdrawals are delayed for several months again.
The real net impact of this scheme is to force exchanges to always maintain a certain minimum balance of BTC which agrees with the Merkle tree; otherwise they can be as fractional as they want.

It isn't semantics at all. The market depth of Huobi is easily 10x as large than BTCChina, as you can see by simply looking at the volume on their respective orderbooks. There's no debate on this point.
Your analysis is flawed because you're looking at the bid-ask spread for the two exchanges and treating it as a barometer for market depth, which it is not.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:09:53
I think they're both equally bad.
Suppose Gox loses everyone's BTC, but has full fiat reserves: then everyone holding BTC can't withdraw, but everyone holding fiat still can.
Suppose Gox loses everyone's fiat, but has full BTC reserves: then everyone holding fiat can't withdraw, but everyone holding BTC still can.
Furthermore, if you're on an exchange that has proven BTC reserves but no fiat, then the only way for you to exit the market is to buy BTC with your fiat. But who's going to be selling BTC when no fiat exists? You'll end up with the opposite of the situation that you had with Gox this time: rather than premiums crashing, they'll skyrocket, and price will go to $5,000 or whatever, unmatched by other exchanges. Everyone sitting on worthless goxUSD will see their holdings immediately get slashed by an order of magnitude, and everyone lucky enough to be holding goxBTC will get out unharmed. It's the same situation we just had, and will end the same way - everyone loses their money.
Furthermore, suppose the Merkle tree solution is implemented (but no fiat auditing), and BTC is stolen. The exchange is forced to spend all their USD to buy BTC to cover the shortfall before anyone notices. But since the market is nowhere near liquid enough to support a purchase of ฿700,000 without the price skyrocketing, they're going to have to spend even more money than they otherwise would have had to to cover the difference - there is a cost associated with converting your reserves from one currency to another. Now BTC reserves look full, but the exchange is even more insolvent than it would have been if they'd left their BTC reserve fractional and their USD reserve full.

A few things:
1. Not only did they respend that ฿0.031337 output, but they also created a new ฿0.0031337 for the occasion. So they're clearly trying to tag the transaction.
2. You correctly point out the huge tx with all of the ฿0.031337 outputs in it, and also, right before that there was [another huge tx of hash 55f48659d94ad503c31d4daa6dc21b1b3273cf1036572be604f437ad7a240d04]( with a bunch of ฿0.009763 outputs.
3. Furthermore, note that the sending address in the above transaction starts with 1BTC411... . I noted above that 0.031337+0.009763 = 0.0411, but I didn't realize that these ฿0.009763 outputs came from a 1BTC411 vanity address, so that syncs up. (Of course, now I want to know what 411 is all about?)

I've never seen it explicitly stated that BTC-only audits are worse than nothing, or seen the incentives I mention in my OP listed anywhere. Can you reference me to somewhere where a discussion about the pros and cons of BTC-only auditing vs no auditing at all has taken place before?
If you look at the comments I linked to [here]( I don't see any sort of acknowledgment that this issue exists. The message is "hey, let's get all of the exchanges to implement this merkle tree scheme and it'll prove they still have the BTC funds. Email Bitstamp right now!" and that's it. There's a real danger of exchanges saying "OK!", implementing the Merkle tree thing, and then leaving it at that. They need to understand that implementing the Merkle tree without an explicitly stated fiat auditing solution that everyone's comfortable with makes everything *worse* - not better, not just as good, but literally worse.
Furthermore, a few days ago, Andreas Antonopoulos from Blockchain.info did an audit of Coinbase's cold storage funds, and the response was [this](




I have never seen it stated explicitly that the bad old "Trust Me" model is the only way to actually audit an exchange, and that an implementation of the Merkle tree solution without such a "Trust me"-style auditor confirming fiat balances is another example of an inadequate half measure that means very little.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:46:50


Yeah, it is. You can see in comment [here]( exactly what he says on the matter:




This approach doesn't do ANYTHING to address customers' lack of faith in any particular exchange's reserves. It should not be proposed as doing so. Messaging all of the exchanges and getting them to implement this isn't going to do anything at all other than to lull people into a false sense of security. Exchanges can still be as fractional as they want, provided they always maintain the correct minimum balance of BTC.
However, you can see in the footnote above, that the other services listed - online wallets, gambling sites, escrows, etc - WOULD in fact benefit from this sort of thing, since they don't also have a giant pool of unverified USD funds. Lumping "exchanges" with this lot is the thing that needs to change. Not only is this solution not "better than nothing" for exchanges, but it's worse than nothing, as it incentivizes insolvent exchanges to become more even insolvent (by the system of incentives outlined in the OP).
What the community needs in order to make exchanges secure is trustworthy third-party auditing for fiat. That's the only thing that's going to work out. This is a good scheme to use in conjunction with that, but proposing it as an alternative is bad.

This isn't the first time we've seen 48 hours of sideways market before. It's happened several times since the crash. There have also been numerous ~200 BTC transactions over the past 48 hours, and the reason that the market's been so sideways is that they *haven't* caused any serious shifts in any directions. We've seen a few 1k BTC transactions in the past 48 hours that also didn't lead to any overall trends.
The current rally is not in any way being caused by people panic buying in reaction to a measly 50 BTC market sell. 50 BTC flies around on Gox all the time and nobody thinks anything of it. There have been almost innumerable 50 BTC transactions in the past 48 hours.
From my perspective as someone who's been watching Clark Moody like a hawk for the last week, the current rally was kicked off by two very large market buys at around 1k BTC each, all happening at the same time that Europe was waking up.

Bitcoin is not a "safe" investment. If you can afford to lose $20, invest it. If you can't, don't. Seriously, it fucks with your head; you don't make cool, calm, collected trading decisions if you're worried about losing your shirt.
Invest this instead:
+$20 verify
Go take the other $20 and use it to eat food and stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-02 10:03:32
Thanks. I thought it might spark some interesting discussion.
The thing called "Abstract and Executive Summary" at the top was supposed to be the TL;DR, so to make it clearer I've now put the explicit phrase "TL;DR" there to make sure people see it.
Yep, since ฿1 = $200, that means that 1000₥ = $200, and hence that 5₥ = $1.

Right... This is why my proposal is to use standard SI prefixes with a / through them.

Or, as Ripple would call it, USD:MtGox, which is much lower in liquidity than USD:Bitstamp.

Yeah. And if you remember correctly, news came out a few weeks ago that said this was going to happen. Aren't you the guy who kept saying that "Bobby Lee was wrong" and that this wasn't going to happen? Well here we are.
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:44:30
Yes, but what does that have to do with the topic of the present discussion?
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:54:34
This is a different topic than my OP discusses, but for the record,  really like ฿ for BTC, even if it's the same as the baht.
I don't think it matters if BTC has a symbol shared with some other currency - there are plenty of different currencies that share the symbol $ (and even the name "the dollar"!) and it hasn't caused a problem. But, I also like the Ƀ symbol too. Both are fine to me.

Oops. So use a different hash instead, like Scrypt. This demonstrates convincingly that he has the preimage.

Oops, dunno why I did that. Exponentially is what I meant.

I really love this idea. I have a few questions for you:
1. Is this open source or proprietary?
2. If the latter, are you planning on pursuing any patents on this technology?
3. Are you set on the business model where you create the devices and sell them exclusively to businesses who want to deal individually with the regulatory overhead involved?
4. Have you given any thought instead to pursuing some strategic partnerships with companies like BitPay, Coinbase, even Gox, etc with complementary services and existing infrastructure to handle the regulatory hurdles involved?
5. Alternatively, rather than partnerships, have you considered pursuing licensing and/or rebranding agreements with these sorts of companies instead?
It would be really sweet if you guys crafted a pitch around this and got Bitpay or Coinbase involved, since they already handle everything that you don't want to deal with and I'm sure they want to expand their business as aggressively as possible. Licensing and rebranding agreements might work out really nicely for you. These companies already have the regulatory stuff down pat, and you have a beautiful complementary invention that fits perfectly into what they're already doing.

Here's history, and it isn't that complicated:
1. We rose too fast, so we'll probably have to revert to the mean and spend a few months in a bear phase, listening to economists talking shit and blah blah etc.
2. By this same time next year, it'll have surpassed the current ATH and probably be another order of magnitude higher again
That's it. It's the same thing that keeps happening. It happened in 2011, it happened in April 2013, and it's happening now again.
All of this discussion about whether this should be called a "crash" or a "correction" or a "bubble" is silly and played out. Call it whatever you want.
Here, I'll make up my own terminology: we just finished going through another "price up go up very fast good good" phase, and now we're going to go through a "price go down fear panic" phase, and then sometime by the end of next year we'll be in another "very yes good price double up x10" phase again.

We should start a bitcoin tech subreddit to delve further into the technologies and into cryptocurrency development in general.
That's the best part of Bitcoin for sure - the way Satoshi solved the Byzantine Generals problem. Clever mathematical trick - solve it by making it solved 99.999...9% of the time...

I think that among the general public, "millibitcoins" will sound too arcane and techy, and that something shorter like "mills" will catch on, but we'll see.
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:53:49
There's no liquidity, last I checked. A $20k transaction would move the market significantly.
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:41:13
It makes perfect sense to type it. In real life, it's weird to be like "I bought ten em bee tee cee" today. It sounds bulky and awkward, as if you were like "I found 25 see you ess dee in my pocket."
I happen to like ₥ because it's stylish and looks like an actual currency symbol, but even if it doesn't catch on, I'm still probably going to call them mills in real life.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:35:47
The point isn't to steal the guy's money. The point is that this guy's wallet is totally insecure and that it's only a matter of time before someone steals it. Furthermore, society has already come to grips with this and created the concept of a "lost and found" for precisely this situation, so this is basically a 21st century cryptographic lost and found.
For instance, say someone accidentally drops a wallet with $400k in it in a bush. You stumble on it. You can either
1. Leave it, hoping the guy will get it but knowing it's just a matter of time before someone else randomly stumbles on the same bush
2. Bring it to the lost and found and let the guy try to claim it.
Nobody has a moral problem with  and the same principle applies here - it's a lost and found wallet. In this case, the solution I advocate is even more effective than a traditional lost and found, because
1. This guy hasn't just "dropped his wallet," but rather he's continuing to use it
2. Unlike traditional lost and founds, he doesn't have to trust anyone like the police to safeguard the funds
3. The guy gets a personal message letting him know exactly where the lost and found wallet is and how to claim his stuff
So it's even more secure than the usual lost and found.

Yes. Banks are how you get fiat into exchanges. If they shut that off, actually getting coins becomes very difficult. It would be like getting rid of Coinbase and Bitstamp and telling everyone they now have to use localbitcoins.com exclusively to actually acquire coins, because the influx of fiat coming into exchanges generally comes from a bank.
Note also that the regulation isn't limited, literally, to banks. It also covers payment processors (TenPay, Bitpay, etc), as well as financial institutions of any kind.
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:56:25
Yeah, they don't work well for me either. I don't happen to like that alternative for the same reason I don't like B⃦. Some people like Luke Jr. insist on B⃦, so I threw the m⃫ in there to appease that crowd, but I prefer ₥.

$1 = 5₥. "One dollar is about five mills."
1₥ = 20¢. "One mill is about twenty cents."
Simple, easy, effective, easy to cognize.
Plus, even if you want to call them "millibitcoins" or whatever, people are going to eventually get lazy and shorten it to mills anyway. Who has time for four syllables?

They are standard metric prefixes, just with a / though them to make them look like currency symbols, in exactly the same way that ¢ works.

He can easily prove it was theirs. Here's how should do it:
1. I'd create a new wallet.
2. I'd take the guy's ฿400 and send it to your new wallet.
3. I'd then immediately send a ฿0.00001 tx back to him saying "As you can see, I have emptied this wallet. You used an insecure passphrase. I will give everything back to you once you send me something from this wallet to prove that it's yours, along with an SHA256 of the passphrase for good measure."
4. Wait for him to do it.
Seems like the best course of action.

It's hard for me to see this notice as a legitimization of Bitcoin. They write




They then go on to say


It seems very clear to me that they consider Bitcoin a "commodity" in the sense that it's something for people to have fun speculating on, but not a currency in that you can't use it to buy stuff on the market ("or else," presumably).
@_date: 2013-11-02 01:41:36
I just wrote a very simple, yet detailed proposal for how ₥, the "mill," should be the symbol for mBTC, much like how ¢, the "cent," is the symbol for 1 cUSD (among other currencies). This will make it all much easier for us to talk about mBTC. You can find the proposal here:
If you find it useful, feel free to link to it in your OP! Maybe this will help us all make the transition smoothly to smaller denominations of BTC. I also went into detail about how this can be easily extended to µBTC in the future, as well as denominations of other currencies like LTC and etc.

Were you shorting on MT4 or something?
@_date: 2013-11-02 10:10:38
Yeah, that was just in case LTC or other currencies decide to follow suit. But yeah, for the most part, I expect to be saying stuff like "I have about 200₥ in my wallet" and expect it to mean Bitcoin.

It's a free internet; use whatever you want. This is just my 2₥ :)
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:48:11
So omit the slash if you like. Some Euro countries just use c rather than ¢ when notating cents, and everyone always knows what's going on. Plenty of people don't even have ¢ on their keyboards anyway, but it's still around and has a recognized meaning as 1/100th of [unit of currency].
To some extent it's about style and aesthetics; I happen to prefer ฿ and ₥ because I think they're classy, but if you're just typing on an ordinary QWERTY keyboard, a simple letter m is fine. I mentioned this in my post under the "variations" section.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:12:58
What do you mean re: shorting?
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:49:43
You'd say 300 mills, not 300 mill. It's like 300 cents, not 300 cent.
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:44:48
I agree. This is why the proposal is to use the SI prefix symbols m, µ, n, p, etc with a slash through them, which is backwards compatible with ¢.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:16:34
I'm not actually sure that the regulation says you can't buy and sell goods with Bitcoin directly. But if it does, then the entire point of Bitcoin is for people to be able to buy and sell things with it. There is absolutely nothing good for Bitcoin about a regulation that says they can't do that.
The fact that Chinese people are currently only using BTC to speculate, and that the law will continue to let them speculate but not use it as a currency, is not a good thing for Bitcoin. It's good if the only thing you care about is speculating on the price.
The Senate bank committee hearing a few weeks ago was nowhere NEAR as bad as this - they basically didn't do anything to it at all - and this subreddit ripped it to shreds because of that one senator saying it was complex and might be used for terrorism. But now we're suddenly supposed to be OK with the idea that this regulation might prohibit vendors from using Bitcoin to buy and sell things? I can't dig it.
I'm not saying that you're saying this directly, but some of these posts on the front page trying to spin this as a good thing should probably just say "stop panic selling because I don't want the price to go down anymore" instead.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:53:40

No, every single thing that I wrote in my post is contained in your post. Again, the key points, this time with the text taken verbatim from your post:








Those are the same quotes from my OP, and as you can see they appear verbatim in your text as well.
You claim in your reply to yourself that the regulation limits itself to saying that Bitcoin isn't what is usually called "legal tender." However, you can very clearly see that the regulation is much broader and more sweeping than that, with legal tender being only one of the things that it covers, and the restrictions on payment processors being another.

I don't know what to make of some of these transactions.
For instance, you can see that 1AwktyL1NTRoBozTQKV9jZaGaxhffvTdq9 sends 10.71 BTC to 1NftUgEis2W8hun325HhYJJuMvAKS7oJJQ.
Then, [1NftUgEis2W8hun325HhYJJuMvAKS7oJJQ]( sends your money, plus ~20 BTC of someone else's money, to [1AH4EGf1z5pzAH1LJfzNU6X5kme99RWbiw](
Then, [1AH4EGf1z5pzAH1LJfzNU6X5kme99RWbiw]( sends 0.02 BTC to the address [1Bit777DrDiSktayWVURPHs7s8RTF9Gma9]( which I think is

@_date: 2013-11-02 21:37:23
I appreciate your feedback, but out of all the criticisms leveled against the idea, I think that the one where it's inconsistent with SI is the weakest. The proposal is basically "let's use standard SI prefixes, put a slash through them, and have them follow the number like ¢." But if you prefer to omit the slash, or to put the currency before the number, I'm sure everyone will still know what you're talking about.

I mean, it's not a terrible idea - the dollar is also called the "buck" and so on (not sure how that started). So this sort of thing isn't without precedent. I do happen to prefer mills for ฿0.001 but if one or more of your names catches on, I'll use those too.
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:09:11

Look at what it says at the bottom
"The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said no financial institutions, **payment agencies** or insurers should price products and services in bitcoin, **nor are they allowed to trade or provide bitcoin exchange or settlement services.**"
This is exactly what Bitpay does. You pay them in Bitcoins, then they go trade the Bitcoins for fiat and give it to the vendor. Their entire business model is to be a payment agency that trades and provides bitcoin-&gt;fiat exchange under the hood. It's absolutely crystal clear that this regulation prohibits payment agencies from doing this very specific thing.
It isn't just like this is a forgettable regulation that only prohibits the creation of banks holding Bitcoin. That they don't want payment agencies using Bitcoin and they don't want banks to even "indirectly" contribute to Bitcoin exchanges. It's going to make things much more difficult for people to use Bitcoin in any capacity except as a "virtual commodity" to speculate on. This isn't the sort of thing Bitpay is jumping for joy about.

@_date: 2013-12-06 03:21:48
Did you see where it says


That's exactly what Bitpay does. Bitpay is a payment processor that accepts payment in bitcoins, which they then sell on an exchange for USD, which they then give to the vendor. Bitpay's entire business model is that they're a payment processor that sells bitcoins behind the scenes so they can accept BTC and give out USD. As you can see, payment institutions are prohibited from selling Bitcoin in china.
It could not possibly be any clearer that this is going to make it a headache for services like Bitpay to flourish in China. Spinning this as "good" is ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:59:47
I must have done a poor job communicating this with my post, but the point of the idea was that these ARE the standard metric prefixes, just stylized with a slash through them to make them resemble a currency symbol. That's basically all that ¢ is - the prefix for "centi" with a slash through it.

250 BTC would not in any way cause the market to massively panic buy. Gox gets 200-300 BTC trades all the time that are no big deal. These past few days it's taken one or two trades at 1 kBTC each to start things moving.
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:50:26

@_date: 2013-11-03 07:14:10
I'm not entirely sure I understand what you mean by this. Can you clarify, please?
Clearly there's some way to actually purchase things on the orderbook (e.g. what'd normally be called a "market order,") so there mustn't literally be "only limit orders," right? For instance, I assume that you could place a limit sell order for $1, and that'd basically be a market sell.

I maintain that the more moral thing for OP to do is move the funds into a new wallet, because it's only a matter of time before someone who's not so altruistic stumbles on the brainwallet and sweeps the account.
All of your objections involve there being some time limit after which OP can take the funds, not the concept of sweeping the wallet. That's fine, and OP should perhaps just leave them there forever, but that doesn't mean OP should leave them there for someone else to steal.
