I've been buying ten dollars a day on auto buy for the past two years. Not going to stop now.

No. The ATM is less than 5 miles from my house. Before this one was installed the closest was 50 miles. I should have worded my original post more clearly. :)

Nope. You can set up recurring transactions on their website, not the app. It's pretty simple and automatic. The only thing I have to do manually is send it to another wallet. It should be under "tools."

I didn't know that. But I think I'd rather do it manually just for peace of mind.

@_date: 2017-01-07 02:39:15
Good. I want to buy some more.

Down 3% now
@_date: 2017-01-21 03:52:20
It's going to be fantastic. Just great. Not sad.
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:58:28
You trying to start a thing.
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:52:31

You want to buy a custom ceramic mug with bit bitcoin, or do you want to buy a custom ceramic mug that's bitcoin themed?
