Most people don't act in any "rational" way whatsoever. We're emotional animals, not robots.

It's also realistic. In the end of the day, people stay in power because the have the "firepower" to stay in power. The fact that we agree to them staying there is inconsequential.

Who do you think funded this "modern technology"?
R&amp;D only goes as far as the shareholders let it go. Companies play by the quarterly report. Projects outlined by companies usually only have a span of 5 years max. Projects outlined by governments have a span of **decades**. Do you really thing something like the space program could have become a reality if there was no government to back it? What kind of company would invest in that? There's no demand from the market, it's too risky, and it costs too much money for any one group to commit to. There are literally 0 dollars to be earned from going to the moon. And yet we reap the benefits from the United States space program to this day, as well as a multitude of other scientific development and research that private groups have no interest to invest in because they have no financial incentive.
