So you attempted to withdraw your dice winnings directly to an exchange address rather that your wallet, even though it's strongly advised to never do this?

...and it begins.  Invasion into everything under the guise of preventing money laundering.
While you made it out fine, I wish you'd have let them go full-press here.  Their ignorance on the technology would have surely resulted in some embarrassment for them.

Sure!  Here he is back in his frisbee heyday:
And a better pic of him now just before the major clouding began:

I'll take a stab here like my other post:
 I'd really like this 1 BTC to help fund my dog's cataract surgery. Bottom line is I can't afford it on my own so the only chance itll happen is with this kind of unexpected cash. He is a 8 year old australian shepherd, already completely blind in one eye and losing sight in the other. Its quite upsetting to see such an active dog take on the appearance of being depressed when hes unable to do all the working-dog activities he used to excel at like frisbee, catch, etc. I've accumulated .4BTC already in this effort.

Seems almost silly to take a shot at this given the immense interest in value but I'll take a stab.  I'd really like this 1 BTC to help fund my dog's cataract surgery.

Here is text from the santos hi dice website:
" Important Notice
Only use wallets that allow you to receive Bitcoin from the same address you sent from. If you're not sure, test by sending a bet for the minimum amount. If you get nothing back, then your wallet is not compatible. Note that some bets may require one confirmation before the win/loss value is sent back."
Did you try this first?

How do you get people to trust these things?  Seems like a genius scam operation....collect cash, dole out bitcoin addresses, keep the private keys and monitor those addresses to either later pull the money back out or to hope someone dumps a huge amount into one.
I personally would never use a bitcoin ATM unless it was owned and operated by someone I inherently trust or that can prove to me definitively that they have no access to, or way whatsoever to ever access or even know the private keys that were generated.

Still not as secure as:

I also wonder if that same volatility prevents users from adopting it as a currency.  Perhaps this period of "storming" is just inherent and volatility will go down proportionate to the number of users interacting?

Thanks!  Showing exactly how new I am, I have no idea how to redeem this tip.  I suppose there is always more to learn!
