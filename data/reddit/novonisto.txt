Good example pick, everyone knows macdonalds. DMM I never heard about before, actually missed that lettering on the advertisement when I asked... An advice, don't judge/offend people you don't know, I understand it's easy and tempting behind a keyboard, but for your own personal development avoid it in the future.

I don't want any of the two and I will do whatever I can to stop both on my PC. I prefer a system that allows me to reward the author/website based on how much I liked the content. The proposed systems (ads, minning) do not reward content quality.

When he was talking against crypto he was an ignorant,  now that he is talking pro crypto he is an ignorant. Sometimes i don't understand the crypto community... 
We understood something before he did,  that doesn't make us genius or an ignorant of him. 
I'll listen to anyone that have generated 1% of the wealth he did.

My daughter was already two years old when I learned about Bitcoin a couple of months ago.
She already got her 1BTC and 1 ETH on a Trezor wallet waiting for her to turn 18.
We are on the same boat. All or nothing
