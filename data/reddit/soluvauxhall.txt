That was a minority fork, less than 10% of the hashrate. Including full replay protection helped its chances of survival greatly.

This will be taken as a sign that the "community" doesn't want segwit2x.
Segwit2X signatories put on their tap shoes and danced for BIP148 which predictably spelled the death of the 2X part. Half of the signatories probably knew this was the plan going into it. The other half turned out to be the useful idiots.

Move your BTC normally to a new address/wallet, this effectively "splits" them as BCH implemented full replay protection. You can then sweep your BCH-containing old (already spent on the BTC chain) addresses by importing their private keys into a BCH capable/following client.

Segwit has been activated on testnet for the entire year that segwit-only was being ignored by miners. LN _development_ needn't wait for activation at all. Looking at the comments here, many were under the impression that LN was ready to go and just waiting for activation. Now, with 20KB of additional space being utilized it turns out that nobody was really "ready" for segwit, either.

Centrally planned vs market determined. The creation of a cheaper *per byte* class of favored transaction, while fighting tooth and nail to keep a perfectly inelastic supply quota on the undesirable tx type we have been using all these years. These variables "needed" to be centrally planned to steer economic usage in a direction that will maximally benefit the providers of L2 services, which just so happen to be the same people doing the planning. 
Satoshi's design was market determined, as he created it, the market came. Now, through inertia and clever PR, a less scrupulous group is leveraging that market adoption to their own advantage and benefit, quietly changing the architecture of the original system.


Well, at least now they can't say they're waiting on segwit.

I don't really see anyone arguing that payment channels and off-chain scaling can't/_shouldn't_ happen. Just that it should compete and be adopted on its own merits, without the intense central economic planning by devs (many with an intense conflict of interest) with regard to native transaction capacity. It's all quickly becoming moot though, as spin off forks will now be applying economic pressure along these lines.

I'm cynical enough to think that Core/BS/theymos have pretty much got BTC locked down, in the intermediate term at least.
However, I also think the 2x companies/miners want their plan to be successful. They will likely choose the path that maximizes that chance. 


The losing side (or even the winning side) will eventually implement a replay protecting fork, so this perceived problem quite quickly solves itself.

Sure it did. The parties involved in segwit2x gave Core exactly what they wanted on a silver platter. You even made sure to give in to the timeline of BIP148, handing them a flawless victory. Now you see the fruits of your labor, a new Core release that refuses to even _connect_ to 2x nodes. They played you like a fiddle. 
Bitcoin Cash only exists as a rebellion against this surrender and its entirely predictable outcome.
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:50:46
I'm well aware of how segwit works, where/how the discount is applied, etc. Watched the core dev IRC to see them decline to include GUI functionality before activation. Also very aware of the "segwit ready" company list that has been trotted around constantly for the last year. 
I'm not making a declaration that it has failed, economic coercion will take a while to have the desired effect in any case. Besides, I'm rather excited for Blockstream's big reveal of their business model.

@_date: 2017-08-08 04:50:08
With the sudden existence of BCH, it makes sense for BTC to take the 1MB base block road indefinitely. Schnorr sigs and MAST will act as padding, to be deployed if the natives get restless. A sufficiently small transactional supply quota and simple economics will push BTC users into the preferred payment channel hubs/networks. No sense in a middle ground if the other army already walked off the battlefield. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:24:58
Spend your funds normally to a new address on the majority BTC chain. This transaction will be invalid on the Bitcoin Cash chain, meaning you can then import the old (already spent) keys/wallet to a Bitcoin Cash capable client and send them again. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:10:43

Yep, centrally planned discounts were baked right in from the beginning. We've got economic penalties for not going along, and economic benefits for signature heavy types of transactions (like LN?)


You must not have been reading this sub. The actual developers remained carefully mum on that front, but I certainly recall reading almost daily how LN was just waiting for segwit and would magically solve Bitcoin's manufactured capacity problems. 


PR doesn't matter, if the native layer's static capacity quota can be maintained. Users will simply be pushed in, using a centrally planned economic carrot/stick, just like segwit.

It's a very good idea to fear monger about utxo growth to smokescreen why you're building in a permanent discount for your future products and services.

I fully retract my earlier statement. 
Sure, "enthusiasts" like you will be able to get less reliable and more expensive routes while the rest of the economy happily signs up for service with their LN gateway/hub provider. It's all about economic incentives, and LN has intensely centralizing incentives.  
I don't expect to change your mind, I'll leave that up to the passage of time. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:30:25


And? 
Uptake of LN clients/hubs isn't going to happen all by itself without carefully chosen perfectly inelastic transactional supply quotas. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:24:55


As channels can remain open indefinitely, LN will be the only way using bitcoin for commerce makes any sense. As being in a payment channel is the only way to really economically _use_ it, calling it "locked" isn't really helpful. 


I haven't seen a convincing economic argument that refutes the tendency for the topology to coalesce into client/hub like you describe.    


The only way this becomes ~~beneficial~~ viable is if fees are very high.
The only way that fees can be modulated higher is to limit native capacity (base block size).

The _absence_ of that raw blocksize increase is what will be used to steer transactional demand into LN Hubs.

It's pretty obvious that by dogmatically restricting the capacity of the native Bitcoin network, you can centrally plan an economically fertile ground for your company's potential 2nd layer products and services. Playing dumb about this dynamic might fool most here, but it doesn't fool everyone. 
Deflecting by saying "but other developers had conflicts of interest too!" doesn't make your own, your fellow shareholders, or your employees' conflicts of interest magically disappear.
Eventually your company might have a deployed, revenue-generating product. I guess things will become a little more clear at that point.

["The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full block chain. In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification. The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks. It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself.
The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed. For now, everyone just runs a full network node.
I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in. The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.
At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN."](

I'm guessing you meant _coercive_. In which case, SF are definitely highly coercive, cheaper transactions via segwit discount are the carrot, more expensive P2PKH tx are the stick. 
A HF means you have to opt-in to the rule changes, less coercive, as it demands your permission to even see the changed chain as valid. 


Yes, in fact soft forks are literally a change forced upon users by miners, as they are changing the rules of the game while blinding my node to the fact that anything has changed.

Miners currently use a centralized relay network run by Blockstream co-founder bluematt, as well as their own private relay networks  including various other low latency tactics. 2X wouldn't meaningfully alter propagation times.

Replay protection is most beneficial to the minority chain. BCH did it to help their chances of survival. 


Only if they can economically coerce nearly 100% of transactions to use segwit sigs. An unlikely short term (perhaps not even LT) scenario IMO. 


This is literally what can happen if the economic majority decides to enforce the current ruleset. You don't need others to do what you want if you are indeed the majority.

A chain fork is the best way to divorce hostile factions, and either side can (independently and unilaterally) determine the method of their (lack of) replay protection. It is mostly advantageous for a minority fork like BCH. A majority fork is hurting itself by breaking all wallets. It would be competitively/economically irrational for a _majority_ fork to implement it preemptively.

He runs a centralized relay network connecting miners. He runs the "bitcoin" PPA.


I sure wish you guys would release your pitch deck. I wonder if your investors are under the same impression. 


If you sold your shares in Blockstream for bitcoin, I might buy this argument. Until then, I suspect that you'd benefit much more financially from a successful IPO of your company than by an increased BTC price.

Pre-segwit it was basically mandatory, I understand that. Now it's technically optional, but still exposed to strong economic and practical incentives.

For the _vast_ majority of nodes, BIP148 _doesn't_ magically activate segwit. It's unlikely to even for BIP148 nodes (with ~16PH mining power behind them) unless they go ahead with the altcoin direction that [luke has been working on lately](

Segsignal seems largely unneeded as BIP148 only managed to recruit ~0.25% of the hashrate (miners actively signaling with 15PH on slush). While segwit2x has 80%+


NYA has been clearly defined as the segwit2x project, and may or may not prevent the BIP148 nodes from forking themselves off at the end of the month.
A "border node" is the strange idea that some miners will use a network facing segwit node software to filter what their mining node sees. A way to not upset segwit nodes, while mining with non-segwit software that has no idea that segwit exists (only possible with BIP149, or BIP141...).

They were full when there was a bunch of fee paying transactions hitting the limit of a perfectly inelastic, centrally planned, production quota. 
Now, the bubble hype is waning, it's summertime in the northern hemisphere, alphabay has ceased to be, and sure, maybe some interested party stopped wasting their Bitcoin paying fees... 
Hitting the 8000000 weight limit would be *really* obvious, filterable if desired, sig heavy multisig tx. It wouldn't even be that many transactions, just levels of multisig we never see used. It would be clear as day. 
Your argument is: Miners are really dumb, hate more valuable bitcoins, and would rather make 7.4 MB (I haven't seen a full 4MB segwit block, ever, not sure it's possible) blocks full of completely obvious spam, ruining the utility of the network, to gain an advantage that is already pretty much moot (with compact blocks, relay networks, header first mining). This is counter to our entire experience with Bitcoin up until now, with blocksizes slowly growing, eventually hitting the ceiling over 7 years, but this time is different because reasons.

My interpretation is that electrum will allow you to chose which chain/server you want to _view/use_.

Depends on if you've specified that you're following that chain.


I doubt it, but it _could_ be done.


Exactly, making sure you send on the chain you intended to (because it would be invalid on the others) is _critical_ if you want to control them separately on all chains. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:10:17


I don't buy this conspiracy theory, and I think the future (quite soon even) will prove that miners desire both. Miners correctly assume that Core will only be giving them one, and not the other, so they have needed to take a different path to achieve _both_ goals. 
Payment channels are a force multiplier for Bitcoin, and miners understand that. They just simply refuse to let a arbitrarily low and committee-planned production quota on block space be used to economically "stack the deck" against native Bitcoin tx to hasten the adoption of 2nd layer networks. Payment channel systems like LN have characteristics that make them competitive without subsidization: instant, nearly free... etc. I'll certainly use it for stuff that on-chain doesn't make sense for. 


Wright doesn't mine afaik, he seems to specialize in ranting and promising things he doesn't deliver. He isn't as respected as you might think on "the other side". I understand why you're trying to smear people with him though, it's a solid strategy. 


There certainly isn't. It would already be activated if the miners' half of the HK agreement was offered, it wasn't. So here we are, miners and businesses are coordinating to do what Core refused to. It didn't have to be this way, and I think Blockstream's product pipeline and the ability to determine the economics of the environment it will compete in, had something to do with it. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:39:50

The way I will go about tainting coins is to get a hold of some newly mined (post-fork) coins on the main chain. Then, create a transaction that includes part of them, with my pre-fork utxo, to a new addy... Then, you can send the original utxo again (because that new transaction is invalid on the other chain), and the transaction won't be replay-able on the main chain, because it's already been spent there. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:57:03
How would they undermine their position if/when UASF fails? They would just switch back to mining the main chain when/if it fails, no?
Leaving the UASF movement with **0.25%** of the network hashrate in the run up to the fork-off event does _much_ more to damage the chances of BIP148 success.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:55:18


Why bother? You've already committed to being on your very own ideal settlement layer coin in just 3 short weeks. I promise we won't bother you, as long as you go through with your commitment to fork right off. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 21:50:31


No, you will own the same amount of coins on both sides of the fork if you owned them prior to the forking event. 
The decision point comes when you want to **_spend_** your coins. If you are not careful about tainting them before you send, pre-fork utxo will be valid on both chains, and replayed on both chains, so spending on one side means you also spent on the other side (again, unless you have tainted your coin with post-fork utxo).
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:38:21
It was designed so that it could be _possible_ to save UASFers from forking themselves off, but it is by no means guaranteed, and is not part of the agreement whatsoever.

Changing the PoW and starting a spinoff ledger to be used as a high-cost low-throughput settlement layer would actually be ideal. If many of the "Evil Jihad Wu controls the mining industry!" were intellectually honest and consistent, they would/should do just that. 
Current bitcoin owners would own a stake in both, and the winner would emerge through market competition, analogous to the process of evolution by natural selection. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 21:03:15
You would need to taint your pre-fork utxo in a transaction with post-fork utxo in order split them, making them spendable on either side without risk of replay. 
Replay protection is for a fork that expects to be a minority. Including replay protection actually encourages a permanent chain split.

It takes quite a long time to get a meaningful number of users/nodes to churn via bitcoin.org downloads to Core's new ruleset (which isn't even released yet). The market will likely not be waiting that long. 
BIP148 might have had a chance with a full push from Core, theymos, etc, but it looks like that boat has sailed. As we've just read, they've basically already deemed it a failure.

This is **false**, and by authoritatively spouting off like this... you are at risk of destroying someone's savings. Any pre-fork utxo will be valid (and replayed) when spent on both/all chains. They need to be properly tainted/split to be used on both/all chains independently.

Given your description, it could only be considered a coup if the Core repository == Bitcoin. It appears many, including the author of this tweet, believe that to be the case. 
I view the network as a whole to be much more decentralized than that. If the desires of the market and its participants are not satisfied by a certain dev group/direction, miners and market participants are free to move to software/devs that better align with their preferences. Users and investors are free to join them, or go their own way, satisfying their own desires which may be incompatible with other participants. 


Just for accuracy, Gregory is not the lead maintainer of the Core repository, never was. That's Wladimir van der Laan, who was given the maintainership by Gavin. 
Gregory did have commit access at one point, but he relinquished that around the time many were complaining about Blockstream's level of influence and access. The fact that the "Core roadmap" is literally an email gregory wrote to the mailing list didn't help to dispel that notion though.

You would have "access" to them on all chains, but would still be vulnerable to replay on all chains as well. It would likely still be on the user to taint their coins post-fork to avoid unintended replay.

Are you saying that some Core devs _aren't_ outright [promoting]( (or at least OK with) BIP148? Or that those Core devs _weren't_ squealing about the dangers of a 75% fork activation threshold? Both?
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:58:01


This is indeed the major difference from the ETH split. 
Right now 22 PH of mining power is signaling that they will mine the UASF side of the chain split. This is a bit less than half of 1% of the network hashrate, meaning the UASF chain would grow at a rate of just less than one block per day, on avg. Without  *dramatically more* mining power, it could take the better part of a year before they get to a difficulty adjustment. ETH retargets difficulty constantly, so it is much more friendly and forgiving to the chain forks of minority groups.
Newly mined BTC also aren't spendable for 100 blocks, so it could be months before these miners could even move the coins to sell them. There's a very real risk they never get to 100, so mining UASF has a very high risk of you simply burning electricity for nothing. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:19:13

Slippery slope argument.
Segwit2x retains a hard limit that would result in double segwit's realistic max block sizes of 1.7-2.1, or 3.4 to 4.2 MB.

@_date: 2017-07-11 23:11:27


This is exactly one of the reasons many don't like the segwit discount. We're talking about a 2MB base block, and now you're squealing that in a bizarre adversarial case blocks could be stuffed with signature heavy spam to get to the 8000000 weight limit.

@_date: 2017-07-05 01:41:34


This is false, it's every 2016 blocks.
Given the current "committed" 0.25% hashrate support, 148coin would see a block solved *every other day*, on average. Given this support was fixed, the difficulty wouldn't adjust for literally years (and the chain would die/orphan from non-functionality well before that). 
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:02:50
segwit2x really has nothing to do with BIP148, the former could activate segwit the same week BIP148 forks themselves off the network.

Miners realize that both a malleability fix and max base block increase are necessary going forward. Miners just don't trust Core to deliver on the latter, so they do what is essentially the HK agreement from early 2016, both.

SegWit **IS** bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:30:23
Miners wanted to increase the capacity of the system for _years_, before segwit even existed on Blockstream's "Elements" project. At the HK "Scaling" Bitcoin conference there was a panel where _all_ miners on the panel were for a modest increase. So, right off the bat, your argument that they want tiny blocks to collect exponentially increasing fees, is bunk.
Miners offered to activate segwit, as long as it came with an increase to the base block size (HK agreement in early 2016). Core didn't deliver on that (aside from a farcical proposal from luke that actually lowered the block size). Core dev ultimately tossed the miners' half of that agreement in the trash, and thus, the miners didn't unilaterally hand them segwit-only on a silver platter. 


So, your argument that Bitmain reneged on that agreement, is also bunk. 
Now, segwit2x proposal is being supported by 80+% of the hash rate (including Bitmain) and a huge number of businesses that generate a majority of the network's traffic. It contains segwit, unaltered, which makes your covert ASICBoost conspiracy motivation, again, completely bogus. 
There's an article about Blockstream's "Liquid" product on the front page right now, it describes how it (their only announced commercial product) _requires_ segwit to become operational. Gee, I wonder why they would want segwit-only so badly? and why they want an artificially constrained native network so badly? It sure does make all the alternatives to native BTC transactions more attractive, including their sidechains (more likely, altcoins, as we've seen this year). For all your conspiratorial thinking, you can't even see a real corporate conspiracy when it's _staring_ you in the face. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:51:23
If miners were so keen to just have segwit-only, they could/would have done that. They weren't, and they didn't... yet you think they just can't wait to display themselves as hypocrites by defecting from 2x.

What he's trying to say, I think, is that it is completely meaningless (and a drain on others' resources) if someone runs a UASF 148 node without doing sizable economic activity with using that node, for themselves or others. No one will care if some random unused relay node forks itself off the network while making petulant demands, but they might care substantially more if a major wallet/whale/exchange's node dedicates itself to using a certain fork.

It's impossible to predict what Core _will_ do. They currently use bit 1.


The bigger question is how this at all satisfies the segwit2x goals. Consider if 30% were signaling at bit 1, and 50% signal at bit 4... you have basically lowered the "segwit _only_" activation threshold to 30% of the hash rate. 
This would be comically stupid for the "segwit+bigger base block" side... and I can't see them doing it, unless they truly just want to save face and set the long term decision making process for Bitcoin right back in Core/.org's lap.

Every non-useful-idiot big blocker knows this.

They also don't like that there's a sizable and undeniable overlap in those implementing the "settlement layer over dialup" vision and those who formed/are employed by a company that will conceivably benefit greatly from this (artificially accelerated) direction.

I just find it amusing that this mindset seems quite pervasive, the emotional feeling that something is being stolen.

@_date: 2017-06-20 02:42:41
Ah, I think I understand what the author intended to convey, which coincided with my previous understanding.
Bit 1 is not accepted for signaling segwit2x, which has to hit 80% *all by itself* to start rejecting non-signaling blocks. Signaling only bit 1, and no 2x HF, actually hurts the chances of segwit activation, but won't be rejected once the orphaning begins.

We're talking maybe 100,000 full nodes? Bitcoin has millions of users, most interfacing through the businesses that supported NYA. If segwit2x is implemented by 80-95% of the hashrate, and the HF block is required to be &gt; 1MB non-witness... those with incompatible nodes will have the freedom to either upgrade to the ruleset the miners are using, make due on a barely functional legacy chain, or change the PoW and enjoy full freedom on an altcoin. IMO, the least likely outcome is that the market will sit on its thumb for a full 12 months for the bitcoin.org/Core channel to implement a change unilaterally via upgrade inertia, to the delight of competing crypto networks.

Hard forks give you a choice, and you consent by upgrading. Soft forks upgrade the network, and your (perhaps dissenting) node can't really tell the difference, it happens without your consent. 


Then why are Core devs always squealing about the danger of chain splits in the event of a HF?
Look at 148-coin, they are doing it correctly, exercising their freedom to fork off to a different ruleset. A 2x HF would be forking to a new ruleset, you either accept it or you don't. Total freedom.

The hashpower securing the Bitcoin network is highly concentrated already, with the vast majority of hardware stored in megawatt + sized facilities. These are known to state actors and could be trivially seized or destroyed. You can either have security through ubiquity or security through obscurity. As it exists today, Bitcoin is much more suited to the former than the latter. You're trying to shove Bitcoin into a ludicrous and ill-fitting suit by trying to force the latter while playing pretend about the physical reality of the mining industry. 
The effects are all very real, security through obscurity leads to other competitors in the marketplace eating your lunch. They might not have enjoyed quite this level of success had Bitcoin performed more nimbly to demand. You should try your safe and obscure, warehouse mined, settlement coin on an altcoin, and it looks like you'll get that chance.

No one is worried about the BIP148 cult teaching themselves an important lesson about how Bitcoin works, it's actually desirable that they fork off at the end of next month.

We're all very impressed.

UASF predictably and hilariously fails, Bitcoin finally moves forward with segwit and a larger base block size. The most committed UASF'ers get new accounts out of embarrassment and start fighting the HF capacity increase part of Segwit2x.

One of the greatest benefits to a HF is going to be giving these nutters their own sandbox to play in.

Saying you support or don't support could influence the creation or continued existence of a chain fork. Staying silent is actually the most neutral they can be.
Many exchanges already made an announcement which can easily be applied to UASF/BIP148:

I doubt it, they don't give up at each successive process node.

In the likelihood that we don't even make it to the first difficulty adjustment, Luke-Jr has said that the final option would be to "fire the miners" with a PoW change. In that case, 148-coin should be very possible to mine at home with our GPUs.
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:34:36
Very interesting PoV, and quite possible.
Though I do think the "HF to larger blockweight is proposed" precedes segwit activation itself. My impression and prediction is that Core will not even entertain the idea, in either case. 
Any complaints on this sub about fees post segwit activation will be met with "Well then use a segwit client and make segwit secured transactions, dummy!"
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:56:26
Huh? Your channel with the hub is already open, additional hops simply require more fees and more risk of unresponsive channel peers.
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:11:11
While I somewhat agree that the lay person is utterly clueless to what is going on... I disagree with your conclusion. 
You bring up the FOMC. An unelected priesthood of technocrats, twiddling the levers of key economic variables to suit their own interests... sounds familiar. The producers, the capitalists, the miners, are not going to surrender their fate so easily.

They would have both already been here if Gregory didn't call everyone dipshits and stir up his minions in an attempt to get segwit-only at all costs.

Bitcoin would be vulnerable if tiny portions of the network were able to successfully hold themselves hostage. The failure of such tactics has the potential to be a substantially _positive_ event, exposing certain elements that have desperately attempted to subvert and dictate the process.

Bitcoin has millions of users that might not care if they don't? And if their node simply stops working due to lack of blocks... it's either upgrade or jump to the new PoW altcoin if you prefer. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 02:01:30
Soft forks force an upgrade (change the rules) without your explicit consent, simple as that.

That's the nice thing about hard forks, they don't trick you into coming along for the ride. 
If you disagree, you simply mine/use the old rules. 
Soft forks, on the other hand, gently blind your node, making it unaware of the changes being made to Bitcoin.

"Signaling" something your node doesn't enforce, that's dedication.

@_date: 2017-06-21 03:08:23
I predict they will stay relatively quiet until segwit activates, then begin ramping up their efforts to bolster the no2x side of the chain split. 
They'll be completely immune to the hypocrisy of being comfortable with the possible BIP148 chain-split risk, while proceeding to squeal loudly about the danger of the HF chain-split. I predict they will _never_ merge it, electing to HF to a new PoW if the legacy chain ends up non-functional due to lack of blocks.

They're both, clearly. 


Of course they compete. The competition is to execute a transaction and gain a fee. I argue that the second layer will be competitive even without knee-capping the "competition", for the reasons I stated. They _are_ complementary, but only because they can _together_ outcompete the other crypto networks.

You're getting segwit (yay, right?), and you'll be free to stay with the legacy chain after the HF. That's the honest thing about HF's, they _require_ your consent rather than gently blinding your node's understanding of the network. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:12:19
So you don't act on the confident-sounding prognostications you make? Leave that up to the mugs reading them? Nice. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:50:32
Could you just taint your pre-chainsplit utxo with some post-split Bitcoin from a miner on the main chain, which might just be operating at about normal capacity? 
This tx would taint the resultant utxo making it invalid on 148-coin. Then you could spend the original utxo on 148-coin without having risk of replay on the main chain (because it's already been spent there)?
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:00:40
This idiocy is why I really hope, through an unfortunate mishap ofc, we're missing a few blocks for the "stop 148ers from forking themselves off" signaling window. :)
@_date: 2017-06-24 03:39:03
Allowing a new form of transaction, that pays less than you do, and appears to be spendable by all... is _changing_ the established rules.
I will concede there are valid reasons for doing it, but let's not play pretend about what we're doing. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:06:03
So we get a chain split now or in a few months, segwit2x folks are dumb for trying to placate the 148 "movement".
