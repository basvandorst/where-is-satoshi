Holy shit so if I just moved a bitcoin to coinbase and back to my private wallet (with no USD conversion), I'm liable to pay taxes on that? Does you know if that technically constitutes as a trade?

Tldr: Coinbase is experiencing more use than ever before and some shit might be slow as they expand. Also he encourages people to use 2-step authentication and to not be retards.
Don't blow it, count your money, keep it simple.

But what about the threat of governments tightening regulations on Bitcoin in the future and making its value as a currency even less? With that in mind, wouldn't it make sense to hold interest in fiat?

I pulled my BTC out a few days ago and the app doesn't work for me.

I understand that attempts to regulate it will increase its risk and lower its value. That's the point I'm trying to make.

Thank you, this is what I was looking for.

The folks at Genesis Mining for example. They claim that on average it takes 10 minutes to crack an SHA256 hash for more powerful computers/systems.
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:20:13
But 100% of the risk of regulation.
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:22:00
That sounds like a personal problem.

Coinbase is delaying all withdraws for 72 hours. Good luck.

Man, you should read Peter's eulogy to his father. It was heartbreaking, really made me pissed off at the state. 
My introduction to economics actually came out of one of Irwin's comics [How an Economy Grows and Why It Doesn't](

Why doesn't the CSS replace a gold icon with a bitcoin icon in this sub?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:35:49
Yes so do it while it lasts.
