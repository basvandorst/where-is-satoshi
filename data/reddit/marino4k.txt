Yeah whoever Dino was kept preparing for the apocalypse 
@_date: 2016-06-26 19:55:12
If only I knew how to actually establish one haha
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:37:19
I hope so lol
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:13:18
773 right now, almost almost
@_date: 2016-06-24 18:48:37
I don't know about "better", I just send funds to Circle with my debit card and then convert to BTC
@_date: 2016-06-22 17:05:11
I think this because when I tried to add my CC to Circle, it said something about some companies may treat this as a cash advance, I definitely don't want that since some cards charge different APRs for that
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:38:07
I use Circle as the middle man between exchanges and my own wallet
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:00:43
Hold on, let me shit myself and pay someone else handsomely to clean it up in the event this actually happens.
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:10:05
Yeah something like that, I don't see it going "to the moon" as people say until well after the halving.
@_date: 2016-06-24 12:31:37
Send to an address with a Circle wallet and then there's a button to convert.
That's how I do it anyway
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:53:51
All will be fine.
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:13:50
Don't CC transactions count as "cash advances", that's still a no-go for me for any exchange
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:32:43
Let's hope
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:50:24
It just does a conversion into btc
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:52:52
Probably people having a panic and selling considering what happened to the DAO this morning.
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:12:19
I wonder if it would be "better" to stagger the amounts over a few weeks/months
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:01:00
The exchanges would probably crash also which could keep the price kinda hanging in the balance
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:54:44
I temporarily pulled out since it dropped below what I could afford it to plus I also think it's going to drop super low again before the halving, I'll buy back in then.
@_date: 2016-06-24 11:31:04
Maybe I'm being negative but I don't feel "surging" is the correct word, not yet anyway
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:19:03
I'm expecting the same, I think this may be one of the last times it gets this low though. With continuing adoption, and another halving coming up, I think the normal price stays in the 700s soon.
@_date: 2016-06-24 01:20:13
Holy shit, I thought stay had this guaranteed 
@_date: 2016-06-14 13:47:27
Should you buy GBTC at this point?
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:42:03
I only made one purchase over 4 months, applied for the increase and they did it instantly. It's linked to my debit card
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:35:23
782 for a minute there
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:59:29
Take a left at the fork?
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:21:44
To the doghouse?!
@_date: 2016-06-25 16:24:00
I'm sick of this nonsense in his this state. I'm ashamed to live here
@_date: 2016-06-14 11:57:40
What does he mean "get off the exchanges"?
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:30:45
You went and got a personal loan for 20k to invest into BTC?
Risky at best.
@_date: 2016-06-26 16:48:05
And here I thought someone was creating a brand new coin.
@_date: 2016-06-21 04:06:29
Did I mention you could be a Nigerian prince?
@_date: 2016-06-17 13:27:08
Is there a HODLcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-27 17:44:18
Is there not a way for an app/device to scan someone's "wallet/etc" to see if the BTC is available to be "spent", then person leaves said cab, then just like a debit card transaction, it holds for a little while before clearing, let the confirmations begin after "confirmation of available BTC in wallet"
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:44:52
@_date: 2016-06-24 18:27:34
I doubt it goes "low", I'd just put in a set amount of money per week, etc. Buy in slowly.
@_date: 2016-06-22 02:09:35
Super bitcoin news for Britain if brexit happens
@_date: 2016-06-24 16:44:37
I think Germany will fight tooth and nail to the very end and I see quite a few other countries going down that road before France.
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:19:01
Don't discourage someone from buying in, we all started somewhere
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:03:58
I prefer Kraken to Coinbase
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:59:33
I remember when it was that much and I just didn't have funds to invest in such a thing, I wish I had.
@_date: 2016-06-26 18:52:54
Marshmallow is needed for its improved security.
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:06:14
I still maintain my idea that it will dip into the mid 500s in the next week or so, then it will spike back up.
@_date: 2016-06-28 10:58:27
They're giving us all free coin to celebrate right? I kid I kid
@_date: 2016-06-27 12:43:44
I've had no issue using Circle whatsoever, I've moved at least a thousand in and out seamlessly.
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:21:35
Did he mean to say 10 days or hours?
@_date: 2016-06-29 03:38:49
Oh wow
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:52:00
@_date: 2016-06-18 13:00:15
Just a regular exchange purchase.
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:41:22
I'm with you, you are paying back 20k to the bank whether BTC takes off or not. I would never use money from my credit or a loan on BTC unless I KNEW without a shadow of a doubt that bitcoin was taking off again into the thousands.
@_date: 2016-06-27 00:09:55
Fill me in!
@_date: 2016-06-25 22:04:45
Although my twitter following is slim to none, retweeted for sure, hope you win in your area.
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:50:16
There's some alt coin out there that I wish would get bigger just because I like the name.
EarthCoin, SolarCoin, CLAMS, etc
Brexitcoin though could really piggy back some publicity and be seen as a coin for the leavers all across the EU, easy to buy in when cheap lol
@_date: 2016-06-22 02:10:10
But it's a good analogy in this scenario. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 02:42:49
Nah, part of me has accepted that I don't have the funds to be all in on BTC, I missed that boat, I think it'll have one more steep drop down into the 500s, I'll buy then.
@_date: 2016-06-24 10:16:24
I see a lot of people say that about coinbase
@_date: 2016-06-23 18:30:02
Yeah why not, I threw in $45, worst case scenario, I lose 45 over a few years if it ultimately goes nowhere, if it does go somewhere, I'm in for a nice payday, you can get a pretty amount of shares since again they're selling for a fraction of a penny
@_date: 2016-06-23 19:32:41
I sold at $700, bought back in at $600, did I do it right?
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:55:13
You have to "buy" bids in order to win a job? No thanks
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:23:37
@_date: 2016-06-14 11:20:13
Because telling people to go search isn't always the best solution, especially for up to date information.
@_date: 2016-06-14 11:31:57
That'd be interesting.
@_date: 2016-06-24 18:23:30
I agree with this also, in a perfect world, bitcoin/blockchain will be the background/platform, and something will be simplifying it on the forefront to make it "user friendly"
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:01:37
I'm cool with 15k a coin though.
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:24:51
If it wants to keep going up $60 every 30 mins, I'm cool with this.
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:38:05
It'll just say funds received from a bitcoin address.
It won't identify you per se.
@_date: 2016-06-27 17:28:56
I'm not sure if BTC/LTC/etc will ever "replace" fiat money, at least in it's current form. I do think it can be a serious competitor to any kind of online payment system (Paypal, etc)
If BTC or any altcoin for that matter wants to take off, they have to find a way to simplify it for anyone who will be normally transferring funds around that's easier than randomized addresses.
@_date: 2016-06-24 16:27:00
I imagine a lot of various things are going through the system right now
@_date: 2016-06-14 11:30:42
So can one use his 401k earnings to invest in GBTC in theory?
@_date: 2016-06-24 12:40:18
This would be nice, the actual US market is surely going down today
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:00:42
A little paranoid sounding but the part about the brexit is probably correct.
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:41:26
Support us Mr Parrish
@_date: 2016-06-24 20:11:31
I know it's still early but honestly I expected a much bigger surge of price due to all this Brexit nonsense.
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:19:39
I do agree that if one of those last 3 big countries leave, the EU as it is today would cease to exist and something new to replace it would likely occur.
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:49:57
I use Circle to take the money from my debit card, then I transfer it to my actual wallet, usually Breadwallet
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:21:22
Not particularly, I don't find it shocking that I don't see it outside of tech circles, etc.
It's not like people who like standard currencies are going to want to see cryptocurrencies succeed.
@_date: 2016-06-23 19:16:46
I mean, that's fairly accurate.
How many people here are only invested in bitcoin because they one  day want to cash out and make money, I admit to being one of them. Of course I'm glad in the meantime to support the platform, but if the day comes, I'm cashing out with no regrets.
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:13:14
Must be nice.
@_date: 2016-06-27 23:52:41
I'm interested at least working on it in some capacity, maybe in marketing it or ideas
@_date: 2016-06-19 19:05:44
I use my debit card and they raised my limit to 3k almost instantly 
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:16:57
I think they're extremely limited during the weekend if they're even there
@_date: 2016-06-24 00:58:03
Signed, I live here
This state is so backwards, I'm ashamed to live here
@_date: 2016-06-24 16:40:57
Go all in.
@_date: 2016-06-22 02:08:00
I bought mine at 730 also, temporarily sold it back out until it drops lower, I'll buy back in then
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:59:47
I'm still thinking it's going to drop into the 500s before it goes back up again, I'm holding out to buy until then
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:38:40
I agree that people on r/bitcoin shouldn't be so cheerful about the ongoing attack on etherum
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:26:56
Clinton is probably the better bet overall for cryptos, I definitely see Trump being a supporter of more fiat currencies.
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:03:18
So if we use our debit cards to buy funds into a wallet or exchange, then make huge profit and convert it back into regular funds, how do they know?
@_date: 2016-06-26 02:29:44
I use Kraken
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:37:31
or Ripple
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:50:40
Those are definitely quite similar.
@_date: 2016-06-13 19:57:42
Kraken has been slow today for sure.
@_date: 2016-06-22 12:45:38
By using the word "threat", they are legitimizing bitcoin as a good alternative option to traditional currencies.
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:58:10
Bitcoin and all other altcoins will only be drops in the bucket in the grand scheme of things until it gains absolute mainstream attention and people truly have a reason to invest money into it, and not just people like me or you but even the non tech, non informed, casual peoples of the world. It needs to be simplified in the long term.
There's no way I could ever explain a blockchain to someone, mostly because I couldn't explain it myself, let alone show an average person about wallets, exchanges, addresses, etc
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:48:33
If I just had a spare million sitting around 
@_date: 2016-06-26 18:49:58
I'm game.
@_date: 2016-06-26 05:49:37
Dead cat bounce?
@_date: 2016-06-21 11:22:14
It is a little strange to me
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:18:22
Maybe a way to link Apple Pay through a Bitcoin wallet 
@_date: 2016-06-23 19:19:22
I got a small chuckle.
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:08:33
Keep on!
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:22:42
Look into Monero.
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:52:30
I might be wrong but I feel like it would maybe end up back where it is now
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:11:44
That's odd, I had an account for about 4 months, but I only did one transaction in that timeframe and they did mine instantly when I asked, I now use it much more
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:54:20
I wonder if all or if any of the altcoins that deal more with the blockchain as a service will benefit.
@_date: 2016-07-05 15:58:51
I'm not super convinced with bitcoin in its current state, it doesn't seem to be shooting up like people keep saying it will, so I'm hoping FOMO will take over and the price starts surging.
@_date: 2016-07-05 17:39:26
People are getting my words slightly mixed up. I'm more or less referring to the people who swear up and down that BTC is going to reach some amazing high of 5-10k USD per 1 coin.
@_date: 2016-07-07 12:01:52
Whoever mines the last block should win a couple of bitcoin prize or something fun like that
@_date: 2016-07-07 16:49:04
Should find a way to get your Circle limit raised, I got it raised to $3k easy.
@_date: 2016-07-17 17:09:07
Corporate greed breeds a lot of the trouble in the economic world.
@_date: 2016-07-01 05:10:56
Maybe Derek is trolling everyone?
@_date: 2016-07-05 19:40:13
Coinbase has pretty much become shady to me.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:16:47
Super close graphs
@_date: 2016-07-06 18:53:02
If this pushes the price up, do it
@_date: 2016-07-07 21:04:13
I just requested a raise limit and done
