I can see how in some ways Bitcoin does look like the Singularity as well as the future in science fiction movies:
1. It makes it easy and fast to send money anywhere.
2. It resembles "credits", which always seem to be the unit of money in Sci Fi movies.

Yes, it looks like it is taking off. But beware. All bubbles burst. We just don't know if it will be tomorrow at $70 or in 3 months at $700.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:01:56
Yep, without the queue Bitcoin would be rising much faster and more likely to pop. However, tradehill is where the big money will come from (billions of dollars), so Mt Gox won't matter soon.
However, the existence of the queue makes the big money know they will  have someone to sell to in the future. So I expect the price to take off now.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:14:40
I think it is too many people trying to buy at the same time.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:21:45
This is going to create huge demand...but it takes weeks for the demand to hit the market...

That's not financial heaven. That's a bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:04:04
I guess bitcent makes sense. I think there are other currencies that use cents, or in the case of Japan, man which is 10,000.
Do most other currencies use cents?
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:17:11
hahaha. too funny.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:57:23
This is huge for bitcoin. As traders find out and buy, it will go up 10x.
@_date: 2013-03-25 07:33:55
It's relevant because the price is affected by the number of people that know about it.
That's the whole point of the original post. If we knew about Bitcoin when it was worth 1/10 of a cent, and we saw the vision of what it could become, then we would have millions of dollars worth of bitcoins now.
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:53:40
If it continues to go exponential, then it will crash.
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:42:55
Thanks for the info. Many years ago I made too many low quality posts. Now I know better...
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:54:06
1. You know about it before 99.99% of the people. So you are actually really early.
2. If and when the bubble pops, you can buy in.
3. If you buy today, you have a much better idea of what Bitcoin can become than anyone did when they were buying at a lower price. So in a way, it is less risky now.
4. If you think it will go to $100,000+ / BTC (as many people do), then you are in great shape.
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:06:32
Fascinating. +1 for "Money over IP".
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:52:48
You can buy a little now, and more if it goes down...
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:34:01
90% change it gets past 200.
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:57:02
That's a good point. Bitcoin is still small so $1,000 / BTC or $100,000 BTC is conceivable. 
It depends on what you are looking for. If you are happy to make a quick 10%, that can happen in a day. If you think it may go to $1,000+, then now is probably a good time to buy.
@_date: 2013-03-20 13:07:33
It might not benefit the average user now because it is more difficult to set up than a credit/debit card. But those systems have been in development for decades ( 50 years?).
Think how it will benefit the average user when their wallet is linked to their Google account? When they can buy anything on the internet with Bitcoin?
If you are dealing with a reputable company (like Amazon), getting ripped off is not a big risk.

Awesome! I own Eufloria and love it.
@_date: 2013-04-07 11:17:54
I came up with the opposite conclusion. There is a 1 month lag between the time someone finds out about bitcoin and they can actually start buying.
Search volume has increased by a factor of 5 in the last month.
Since there is an approximate 1:1 correlation, this suggests that the price could go up by a factor of 5.

It's much better than taking money from a loan shark and putting it to work on the roulette wheel.
Here's why:
1. The credit card will not do anything to you but lower your credit score and attempt to collect by suing you. Any self respecting loan shark should inflict bodily harm.
2. You can make an educated analysis of Bitcoin. A roulette wheel is random (at best) and the odds are against you.
3. The upside is arguably higher. There is about $8 trillion in gold and $50 trillion in currency at the moment. If 10% of this money moves into Bitcoin, it will exceed $100,000 per BTC.
Although Bitcoin is definitely not a sure thing, it is much better than "taking money from a loan shark and putting it to work on the roulette wheel".
@_date: 2013-03-20 12:33:44
I had a similar experience. Spent 8 hours trying to get it to work. It was very frustrating. Finally got blockchain.info API working. Their example was much better and their service works.

@_date: 2013-04-09 11:54:50
Yep - just like cell phones. They are more popular than land lines in third world companies because it is way cheaper to put up a cell phone tower than to string phone lines.

What do you mean by "The govt's"? Are you saying that governments around the world are going to coordinate the outlawing of bitcoin? 
Just look around. Most of the governments around today can't even manage their own budgets, let alone coordinate a worldwide shutdown of bitcoin. They don't even understand what bitcoin is.
I think that worldwide anti-bitcoin government coordination is highly unlikely.
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:28:29
This is very important. When the big money comes in, Bitcoin will rise by a factor of 100x to 1,000x. That means $10,000 to $100,000/BTC.

@_date: 2013-03-28 03:21:39
Oh, wow. This is huge. If Gold and Silver Bugs buy bitcoin, the price could go up by 100x. There is about $8 trillion worth of gold at this time.
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:49:55
I didn't get it either. I guess people who place bets like that aren't very good at math...
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:57:34
I would buy right at 200. Once it hits that it will probably keep going.
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:56:52
Awesome. And fascinating.
@_date: 2013-03-17 18:39:00
The US M3 money supply is about $16 trillion, and rising fast. Currently there are about 11 million bitcoins. That is a ratio of 1,400,000 : 1.
Or, $1,400,000 per bitcoin. So $50/bitcoin could be quite low.
@_date: 2013-03-25 07:39:16
I guess that will be good for everyone who owns bitcoins and has a fixed mortgage.
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:38:47
Amazon has a history of disruptive innovation. The Kindle is replacing the 400 year old book. Amazon refused to pay sales tax in California. And Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud computing provider.
Since they are minting their own coins, it will be natural to exchange them for bitcoins.
When that happens, Bitcoin might increase 10x in value.
@_date: 2013-03-22 15:10:40
This "article" is retarded. It is just a jumble of mis-information. 
Isn't Bloomberg supposed to be a respected source of financial information?
It's garbage like this that makes me think the price of bitcoin should go up at least 100x. That makes $10,000 per BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-20 13:16:11
If businesses get involved (like Amazon) and Wall Street gets involved, then it should rise by a factor of perhaps 1,000. That is about $50,000 / BTC.

That guy was just arrogant and scared. He didn't understand Bitcoin and he didn't want to. He is part of the establishment that sees Bitcoin as a threat.
It is a threat. Wall Street and governments have been leeching off the people and stealing their money through inflation. If and when Bitcoin becomes popular their days of easy leeching will be over.

This is actually one of the best reasons to buy Bitcoin. 
If the US defaults, then the dollar could stop being the worlds reserve currency. So, the world would choose something else: either the Chinese Yuan or Bitcoin.
If the world chooses Bitcoin, then that is probably the best thing that could happen for Bitcoin. The $70 trillion in fiat currency would start to move into Bitcoin. And much of the $17 trillion of dollars could be converted into Bitcoin. 
If 20% of $70 trillion were converted that would be $14 trillion in Bitcoin. Let's say it happens in a 2 years and there are 14 million bitcoins. That makes $1,000,000 per bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:11:21
It took me 6 weeks to get my accounts verified and start buying...but not on coinbase...

Here's a number based on the money supply. There is about $50 trillion in fiat currency now, and 11 million bitcoins. If 1% gets converted to bitcoin, that is $500 billion. That is $45,000 per bitcoin. That is an increase by a factor of about 1,000.

Bitcoin is actually better than gold for many of the reasons that people love gold: Limited supply, money supply explosion, cannot be confiscated,  freedom from government.
Also, as stock_blocker noted, I agree that a ban would raise the value of bitcoin. Why? Because it would fail and prove its freedom from government.

I don't think it is a ddos/hack attempt, but if the week starts like this and ends with an increases of 50% that's fine with me.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:03:25
Yes. It is rising faster and faster. If this continues it will probably crash.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:40:37
Yeah, just like the US dollar.

That is only true for the clueless.

This is a great analysis, but we need to consider other less technical values:
1. How many people are finding out about Bitcoin each day?
2. How much is it being legitimized? The biggest event so far is WordPress.com
3. How much do people use it, as opposed to hoarding it?
4. How quickly can people buy it, once they find out?
I think that since it is being legitimized quickly at the moment, this delays the bubble bursting. Also, it takes 1 - 2 months for most people buy after they decide that they want in. I think that this has a further damping factor.

There are many people who will say the same thing tomorrow. Except that they bought at ~~$75~~ $80.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:56:52
It's gone up since then.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:50:00
I agree. I think the price action over the last 48 hours does not look like a bubble.
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:38:37
When the big money moves in, like Wall Street, the price will go up 100x to 1,000x.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:05:51
It is a bubble. Nobody knows when. Could be today, could be in a month.
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:23:17
Me too...
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:44:07
Maybe that's what's happening now...
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:02:02
It would be a huge boom. The idea that Bitcoin is only useful for to buy drugs would die.
@_date: 2013-03-21 22:06:06
This is the tip of the iceberg. What happens when big hedge funds and mutual funds hold bitcoin? The price will rise 1,000x.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:11:27
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:15:14
1,000,000 - hopefully.

I calculated a 100x increase from $0.30 to $30. This time started around $10, so that would be a value of $1,000.
But the size of the market is different now. Billions instead of millions. So perhaps that will have an effect of the speed of the bubble...
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:06:43
Wait till it hits 200. Then it will take off.
@_date: 2013-03-20 13:13:36
The world money supply is about $50T. So $1,000,000 / BTC is 20%. That is a bit high. But I think 10% is possible. That makes $500,000 / BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:47:04
The greatest wealth transfers occur during financial upheavals. If Bitcoin does go to $10,000 or $100,000/BTC, then the greatest wealth transfer in the history of humankind would take place. 
You may have just predicted the future.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:22:07
There is $70 trillion in fiat currency. With only 21 million bitcoins, it makes $3,000,000 per bitcoin. If bitcoin becomes just 10% of fiat, then that is $300,000 per bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:05:21
Yes but tomorrow it would only cost 150 BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:14:19
They don't have to. Individuals who like gold and silver can buy.
@_date: 2013-04-07 10:48:11
I didn't see bitcoin on this chart...
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:46:27
@_date: 2013-03-21 22:12:42
Didn't take long...
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:45:10
You aren't driving a Tesla now? Then I hope you are driving a Ferrari or Lambo...
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:18:25
It is still only a drop in the monetary bucket. There is $50 trillion in fiat currency, and perhaps another $50 trillion in stock markets in the world. The total is $100 trillion.
If bitcoin replaces fiat currency as a unit of exchange and value, perhaps it would be 10% of $100 trillion, or $10 trillion. Right now there are 11 million bitcoins.
That makes approximately $900,000 per bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:11:03
Why are you convincing anyone to invest in BTC? Why don't you invest first?
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:08:03
$85 billion per month? Can I have a billion $ please?
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:46:31
Fascinating. Only $3,400,000 to get to $200 / BTC!
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:23:21
That's not the U.S. inflation rate. That is what the government ***says*** is the U.S. inflation rate. Only the stupid masses believe it.
FWIW, the masses have not invested in Bitcoin **yet**. When and if they do, the value will rise 100x.

"Analog money" - first time I've heard that term. Interesting.
@_date: 2013-03-22 15:16:47
Bitcoin. The dollar is falling, and gold has gone up quite a bit.
I think Bitcoin is just getting started.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:34:07
How about now?
