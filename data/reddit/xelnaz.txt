As far as I'm believe yes, They mix your coins with millions of others so you can receive untainted/untraceable cryptocurrency back.

So after research there are trusted blenders out there despite someone said in the thread.
"Assume all of them are fake"
Thankfully it wasn't much money I lost but that's besides the point.

Already done cheers. It's an even stronger password I've written down somewhere and logged in successfully already after the recent transaction went through
@_date: 2018-05-28 03:21:33
Any suggestions to make my coins untainted/anonymous then?

I also find it odd that your last reddit post was 1 year ago on then suddenly when I send a support message threatening your phony services on the  bitblendervrfkzr.onion URL  and that my coins disappeared you respond in here trying to add credibility to your services.
I've sent you several support messages and you haven't responded.
You're also registered on bitcoin talk and your last login was 2 months ago on there. Why own a "reputable" tumbling service yet you cannot regularly participate in community discussion and respond to user questions, complains and disputes.  
I will keep bumping this thread unless my coins are refunded by you as a result of this scam. It is as a result of your website there is a "phishing scam" so I quote on google and unless you rectify the situation of 5x 3mbtc per address in my account I'll consider it fake and keep posting everywhere I can find all 3 sites linked are owned by you and you are the entity that owns all 3 services.

Not intending to be rude or demanding and I know there must be a huge amount of work for you to perform at the moment but how come you haven't responded to any of my support messages regarding a password reset of my old account?
Why is it in these threads linked above a user has proved your service to be unreliable just like the other phishing links and deposited small amounts of BTC to test his theory out which proved to be correct.
There's a bunch of negative feedback online regarding your tumbling services so I recommend you rectify the situation by reporting the phishing links to google or whatever you can do to protect your service,
I will send another support message and will eagerly be waiting for a response and password reset on my old account.
Your URL was one of the links if you read correctly and compare the 2 regarding phishing and scamming.

All 3 websites mentioned above are owned by the same entity. There have been tests performed on these websites.
There are far more reliable mixers with active owners still discussing their mixers to this day with regular forum participation.
So far nobody has had any response from support on all 3 links, That goes to say a lot about the entity that owns these mixing services.
I've sent at least 5\-10 messages since weeks ago and never have received a response.
Sounds like you're trying to promote the entity or you are him.

I have deposited a small amount of btc into your service and everything seems to be good with the link you have provided.
I will be making another deposit in the near future and hope the service is reliable otherwise i'll be posting this information everywhere possible along with the new blockchain addresses which will severely harm your tumbling services reputation.
It seems you might be correct and the evidence is suggesting that I was phished by the link because there was activity on one of those wallet id's back in feb when I wasn't even registered.
I have deleted that account on the phishing site and bookmarked yours for future reference along with changing my password to something more secure.

It's worked before, He's used the wallet for transactions
@_date: 2019-06-11 14:47:04
Same address my friend, I buy btc like this everytime without any problem
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:20:09
I'm going to reddit it and google it
@_date: 2019-06-20 12:32:00
What's joinmarket?
@_date: 2019-06-11 14:46:39
Yeah he's tried that, Thanks for the suggestion though
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:09:26
Is it trusted?
How do I know it's not a scam
@_date: 2019-06-20 12:15:41
Supposedly it does I was reading other threads regarding it.
Just wanted to see what other people had in terms of experience with this.
@_date: 2019-06-11 14:51:12
From what I can remember it just kept synronizing, I told him to uninstall and reinstall with the latest version if possible
It was sent from a local btc exchange
Never had a problem with them even with high amounts of money
