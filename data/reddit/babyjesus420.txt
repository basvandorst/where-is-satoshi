So if there is a crash of sorts I would need to be speedy at buying. 
I have been watching the bitcoin market for a few weeks now and am kicking myself that I didn't invest as soon as I found out about BTC. 
Do you have any experience in mining? And would it be worth dropping the $1300 for an ASICs machine?
Sorry for all the question but thanks in advance.

That's what I'm starting to figure if I can recoup my initial investment withing 6months I will be happy. Also factoring in electricity cost at around 30cents/kw and anything else related. 
I have never attempted to mine a single coin because I believe the hardware I have will be useless.

When will this crash occur?  As I'm keenly awaiting.

After doing some more research into the matter of ASICs I have decided against taking that plunge. 
I am concidering more and more to put my savings into BTC but with the market increasing the way it has in the last few weeks I'm scared to purchase at such a high rate In case something goes tragically wrong.
Would you advise to purchase BTC now at the current market rate or wait and see if it settles after the Spanish and Europe calm down? 
As an old bloke once told me your never going to win unless your in the game.

I think you may have convinced me to buy an ASICs machine and start mining for a while and see where it takes me. 
Thanks for the advice kind stranger I think I'm in for a bit of study tonight before I commit to it.
