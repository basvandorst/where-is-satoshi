Ok, so before I liquidated a portion am I going by LIFO standards? And seeing as prior to the perceived revaluation of them I have lots of transactions that offer themselves to my interpretation. Surely there is a way to stay within the rules and regulations while still preserving the greatest amount of assets.

I've countless transactions over the last couple years at multiple addresses so there is really no single price I purchased at. I also recieved coins in trade and payment. I guess If I wanted to I could show a high purchase price and a slightly higher sell price and so would display short term gains. I have my own records for what I paid at given times but nothing official.

Deep breaths. Yea, I don't know if that's worse than not investing in Asicminer last year or not.
