You can daytrade if you want to, but don't expect it to be easy. If you daytrade, you should expect to lose money (at least at first).
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:40:06
Yeah the price might go down it might go up. I'm on the sidelines waiting for things to look bullish again.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:21:12
At least you made money. At least you didnt buy $75000 worth of bitcoin at 19k
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:01:25
tl;dr I cashed out of crypto so I could sleep better.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:51:38
That's funny I feel the same way about ethereum
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:15:22
Is it a good time to buy? I think so. I don't know if bitcoin is the best crypto right now, but I think that all three of bitcoin, litecoin, and ether will go up.
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:53:36
Basically yes, you already have a gdax account. You might have to do some additional verification but it shouldn't be too hard. You may have to give photo ID, in which case you should use a mobile device (with coinbase app) to take the pic as laptop webcams will probably be too low quality.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:32:46
I think it can go down to 8500, maybe lower. I've been reading this on price analysis sites, so thats where my info is from. This is gonna be a big dip, but as far as I'm concerned its still part of the dip back in December. I would sell now if I were you (I sold a while ago, actually) and buy back in when it looks like its rock bottom.

Daytrade if you enjoy doing so, and are willing to take on huge risk. Otherwise, hodl. Daytrading is not free money, and if your only motivation for doing so is greed/fomo then you shouldn't daytrade.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:52:21
Bitcoin is scaring me right now. I think this is worse than hodlers realize. I still believe in crypto and, to a lesser extent, bitcoin, but that doesn't mean the market can go bearish for months or even years.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:21:52
I agree, tbh. I cashed out of crypto yesterday because the markets are too volatile and the tech isn't ready yet. I finally overcame my FOMO.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:22:27
It's now less than 1mn$ fyi
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:53:15
I think that's a valid viewpoint, but I would rather miss out on a little profit than get killed on an investment that tanks 50% right away and gradually comes back over the course of months.
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:21:56
I could probably help you out. I'm a bitcoin/crypto enthusiast and a computer programmer, so I have a decent understanding of the underlying blockchain technology. If you want me to write, send me a PM with more details.
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:29:31
I don't know much about wallets, since I use coinbase (actually GDAX). A lot of people on here are against coinbase for good reason but it's not a bad place to start if you're a crypto noob. If you want to get started, you should buy crypto from an exchange and the tranfer them to a wallet. I've heard about Trezor wallets so you might want to read on those.
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:15:55
The energy use of bitcoin is concerning, but I think that it would be acceptable if bitcoin became a major part of the world financial system. Also, scaling solution may alleviate most if not all of the problem.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:11:04
We're going up but also down. Same as always.
@_date: 2019-07-31 01:08:30
Bitcoin wants to be this when it grows up
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:18:51
I don't want to dishearten you, but expect weeks or months. As high as you bought, I would probably just hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:12:03
I made .1 bitcoin by trading today. What did you do?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:18:16
I made a lot of money on litecoin today. That said, I'm into bitcoin right now because I believe that litecoin's gains are very unstable. Bitcoin seems pretty stable at ~17000 so I'm going to stay there for a while to catch my breath.
Be careful about going to the well once too often.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:33:08
I'm selling, don't want to hold it overnight. But I have alarms set for both 16,000 and 14,000, so I'll know if it goes up or down. I feel optimistic in the long run, but this dip is more disturbing than even the 5600 one.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:59:37
I hodl'd the 5600 dip, this doesn't scare me
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:58:10
Coinbase is where I started. I recommend looking into gdax, which is related to coinbase.
@_date: 2018-09-17 09:11:02
I suspect that we will rally a little at the end of this year, maybe as high as 9k level. But after that we crash below 5k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:38:33
Good for you. I got in at 7500~ so I was even less scared. I was having flashbacks to the time when it dropped to 5600 though.
@_date: 2018-09-12 06:31:09
Timewise, I think this bear market has anywhere from 1-3 years to go.
I do not own bitcoin, and am waiting for better accumulation prices. Imo 6k is not a good price.
To end the bear market, in my opinion we don't need adoption although that will help. Rather, we need inroads for institutional investors. ETFs, having btc listed on major exchanges, and having corruption driven out (eg tether) are what we need to happen for institutional investors to step in.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:09:00
It's still puzzling to see why it would happen
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:20:03
I made a song for when the cryptocurrencies drop. It goes like this...
Crypto droppin', crypto drop.
Crypto droppin', crypto drop.
Crypto droppin', crypto drop.
Crypto droppin', crypto CRASH!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:36:42
It could take a day or two. ~~be patient~~ utterly panic while the price skyrockets
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:50:03
My theory is this:
Right before BCH came to Coinbase/GDAX, BTC was up to 19,700. That means a lot of new money was flowing in. But, when people sold their BTC to buy BCH, the price went down, which spooked the noobs, which caused the price to drop more, spooking more noobs. Also, there's a transactional backlog right now.
The most comforting fact to me is this: if you look at world coin index almost all the cryptos are down. If it was only bitcoin, that would be worrying, but its not. Obviously all the cryptos can't go down forever.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:43:16
It can't hurt. It won't ever make you rich though. I would try to buy at least .01
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:42:34
probably not until 2019 anyway
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:38:11
How was it better? Not very helpful unless you explain.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:23:13
Although your level of optimism is delusional, it is counterbalanced by the craven fear that is exhibited by the bitcoin noobs.
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:26:59
Thats bullcrap because btc has been rallying hard that whole time. So almost every month has been bullish the last 4 years lmao.
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:30:07
You re-scaled on the x axis. That's a big no-no.
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:45:34
upvoted. Inb4 OP is accused of spreading FUD.
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:55:15
"The Earth is flat" is a (false) statement regarding an objective fact (aka, the topology of the Earth.
The other two are subjective statements. Putin is great in some ways and terrible in others. Bitcoin has at least some value (in my opinion).
Part of the post-truth era is liberals going around saying that X is an objective fact when it is actually a subjective opinion. Seems like some people literally can't distinguish between fact and opinion.
@_date: 2018-08-19 03:36:48
You have no way of knowing where it came from. If you think you do, you're bs'ing yourself.
Have a good one too.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:49:27
I could see that as well. I'm preparing for a dip as low as 1k.
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:50:03
I betcha didn't see the massive hidden bearish divergence playing out on the daily chart.
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:45:45
That's a good point. If so, we may never see ATH again but may become rangebound between say 10k and 1k.
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:43:30
There are so many forms of TA that most of them don't work like that. That said, everyone on this subreddit seems to think that bitcoin is going to 100k or 1m. Is that from TA? Apparently one guy calling for 3-5k is heresy.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:25:50
Bitcoin can't rally because there's no new money flowing in. Look at google trends. No-one wants to buy btc anymore. We're headed for a year of pain, maybe even another 2014
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:38:10
resistance is useless
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:25:52
Volume keeps dropping. Every time we rally, more people sell off. We're making a descending triangle, a bearish development. It is entirely possible that we go lower than 3-5k.
@_date: 2018-08-25 04:27:53
I think that changing the time scale makes the whole thing very hocus pocus, The fractal theory itself is already very hokey.
I also think that there are a lot of bag holders still in the market who want to get out, but can't. So for that reason I think the bear market has a long way to go.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:48:01
Mock me all you want, when the real pain begins I'll have money in my pockets for buying the dip.
@_date: 2018-08-17 19:43:05
Go put the bible in the toilet where it belongs. I'm sorry dude but that book is more full of crap than your average port-a-potty.

This is not my video but the guy who made this has made a lot of good calls. He called the dump from 11.6k to under 9k.
This is 2014 all over again folks. Be careful.
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:56:34
I'm going to buy if we break 6k and create panic lows, or if we breakout of 12k. Right now the market cap (for all crypto) keeps topping out around 470 billion. So if we break that its a very bullish sign.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:46:11
1. You don't send coin to an IP address, but to a bitcoin address. This never happens
2. The coins either disappear if it is a known burn address, or if the address format is invalid, the transaction would be rejected and the coins would be returned to you.
3. No-one owns a bitcoin address per se. You either know the private key or you don't. If you don't know the private key, the coins are again lost forever.
4. Same as 3 above. Note that it is not necessary for an address to have a running wallet with it for it to receive bitcoin.
The addition of the lightning network might change the answers to some of these questions.
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:44:01
I hope you didn't buy more than you can afford to lose. I suggest you sell any pullback because we have suffered clear rejection from 10k. This will force us to test the 7k region, possibly even 6k.
If you want, you can sell a portion now and a portion at a stop loss of 8500.
Also, I really don't think an explosion is imminent. Sentiment remains stale, and big players likely want to keep btc rangebound for a while so they can accumulate. Also, google trends interest in bitcoin continues to trend down. I don't thinkvery much new money is coming in to crypto, unlike 2017. Now, we really may see 30k btc later this year so I would not panic sell if I were you. Please be careful.
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:32:42
When you bought above 9k and now your portfolio is in the gutter
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:14:09
Well, I think btc is going down below 6k, probably below 5k, maybe even below 3k. If it does, we can gloat together at these fools. Then we'll buy their bitcoin to relieve them of their agony and ride the next bitcoin bubble up together. How does that sound?
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:51:09
If you think the real bottom was 4 months ago, then you're living on pluto. Back then, we had much higher volume and bitcoin rallied to almost 12k immediately after. Now, we couldn't even make it to 10k after a manipulated move that brought us out of what was essentially cardiac arrest. Money is leaving this market in droves.
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:19:45
It's based on a number of factors. First, bitcoin consolidated there for a while in 2017, and points of consolidation usually act as support. Also, it's the next logical region below 6k which will eventually break imo because we are forming a descending wedge.
Finally, bubbles usually resolve around their long term regression lines, which for btc is around 4900.
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:15:22
we had super low volume then. I'm still not convinced that that was the bottom.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:48:36
I was one of those who warned people away. I was mostly met with derision. Although I expect no apology, the sound of my own money bouncing safely in my pockets is consolation enough.
Thanks to the fact that I didn't hodl, some of the money in my pockets once belonged to someone dumber than I.
@_date: 2018-05-10 18:37:12
0 . May buy some if we dip below 6k.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:58:11
I agree. I don't think we've bottomed out yet, and yet 50k or more is still possible. I don't the the bubble that will eventually be known as "the bitcoin bubble" has even formed yet.
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:17:39
I've been saying 3-5k for months now.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:44:11
When the price makes lower highs but RSI makes higher highs, it's called a hidden bearish rsi divergence.
@_date: 2018-05-15 03:13:36
Well the chips were designed for rendering graphics, so...
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:47:25
I agree. At the very least, that level reflected the sentiment of bitcoin traders.
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:44:30
Yeah hodlrs should buy at 19k and hold at a loss for several years to achieve the maximal masochistic buzz.
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:01:11
ugh I HATE the fact that bcash rallied so hard. May it crash below 100$ on the next correction!!
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:26:44
Yeah with an asset like btc that has a lot of buy support, it's usually smart to seize on the capitulation days and panic lows.
@_date: 2018-05-11 07:08:19
Most buy and sell walls are fake. They put them there to influence the market. It is smart money, but they're not buying. The big picture is that anything 8600+ is supply and demand doesnt really come in until 75-- and below.
This is starting to look ugly. we just broke 8800. We're in real trouble now.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:31:24


[This time is different](
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:06:30
Or, hit 9950 and dump straight to 6k
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:09:19
Yeah, my prediction that we will break 6k isnt really based on TA. That said, TA isnt total crap imo and can sometimes be useful. Only sometimes, though.
@_date: 2018-05-15 02:38:58
Well, to be fair, the gamers are using the chips for their intended purpose. But its a free market so who really cares?
@_date: 2018-05-13 01:16:20
People like him are why bitcoin is so overvalued right now. He thinks that JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are gonna get into bitcoin and make him rich, but actually they're gonna find a way for him to make them rich.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:24:37
BTC is heading back below 7k maybe even 6k. I think btc is clearly overvalued at 8k.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:49:08
It's not homeopathy. I'm literally watching money leave the market on each rally, as volume decreases steadily, week by week.
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:14:47
I think its due to less buying and trading of bitcoin. It's a bearish sign. Batching is part of it but not most of it.
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:00:59
Because bitcoin only hit 7k in freaking november. And because so much money is leaving this market. I think we're gonna go back to where we were roughly a year ago, form a strong accumulation base aorund 3k, and then gradually return to ATH as positive fundamental news rolls in, as long as regulatory concerns are quelled.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:57:50

@_date: 2018-05-11 15:41:52
Damn dude, the market crashed even faster than I thought it would. If I were you I would sell around 50% of by btc so you can buy in lower. Based on how fast we moved down, I think the real target is below 8k.
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:02:48
Not likely unless he shorted form 7500 with high leverage. Then again, some people are a bit retarded that way.
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:29:33
I think it's more than a passing trend, but the mania phase is winding down. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:16:58
I'm waiting to buy when we get into the 3k-5k range. That's where the *real* bottom is.
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:36:26
I don't own any btc. I'm gonna buy if we break 6k and make new panic lows, or if we pass 12k
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:43:37
So, all the pc gamers are supposed to start mining crypto, eh? Any idea what that would do to difficulty and hence profitability?
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:06:03
You're certainly smarter to buy bitcoin than shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:09:18
I'm not sure if we head to new lows, but we will most likely test low 8k again at least.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:52:27
On the other hand, a lot of the "buy support" is pumps from  few whales that are interested in keeping the market afloat.
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:02:04
If we break 12k that would signal a decisive end to the bear market, and thus ensure maximum safety
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:38:45

It takes more than one investor. And they will all buy discreetly. Why? Because they trade on fundamentals. They don't need their trade to be in the green by 5% within 24 hours for them to feel comfortable. they know that bitcoin isnt going away and that this dip is a wonderful buy opportunity.
@_date: 2018-06-12 04:50:17
I think we're gonna correct pretty deeply. This is 2014, my friend. But don't forget that 2014 gave birth to one of the greatest bull markets ever seen. In time, bitcoin will rally to new highs. Gotta wait maybe a few years tho. Maybe only 6 months. Who knows?
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:26:33
You did, but there's so many morons on here that I can't blame you. I'm sticking around to buy back in lower, like you suggested. However, I want to be careful not to buy a falling asset.
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:13:36
Sounds like a plan. I'm gonna buy a bit above 4k because I think we'll bounce from there, but I think we may correct much lower, so I'll probably sell if we get to around 5600 or so. Regardless, 4k is a good long-term buy no matter what.
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:59:54
Hmm. I could see 5k. I think that's reasonable, but I'm beginning to suspect we'll overshoot.
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:55:22
Yeah. As a libertarian, I really love the idea of owning a cryptographically secure non-govt issued currency. It's high risk of downward price movement that scares me away.
@_date: 2018-06-04 18:02:28
ummm buy low, sell high? additionally, short every rally of more than 200$ or so?
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:20:30
I'm not buying at 6k lmao. If anyone wants to buy at 6k, then that's their business.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:48:21
I'm sorry that's how your investment played out. I will become a buyer of btc when we hit the 2k range, similar to you.
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:20:49
damn. legos are almost as great a investment as bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:32:27
Don't be a fool and hold at a loss. If you believe in the tech, you can sell now at marginal loss and rebuy. If I were you, I would never have allowed a profitable position to turn into a loss.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:07:58
Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if it goes that low. My target buys begin around the 3k range.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:07:00
I sold out way back in January. I'm not a bag holder.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:42:20

Sounds like you haven't met a good friend I like to call Mr. Dumpy. Mr. Dumpy appears when no-one expects, especially when everyone is certain he won't. Mr. Dumpy will make sure that you don't have any fiat left for buying bitcoin left when he comes.

@_date: 2018-06-28 05:48:40
Bitcoin Cash (while I am not a fan of it) is a legitimate alternative to Bitcoin. Although the differences are rather technical, Bitcoin is better overall. However, Bitcoin Cash (or BCash) can still be used to transact purchases. You should be aware that if you are talking to a staunch BCash ~~supporter~~ shill, they may intentionally refer to BCash as Bitcoin. If you're not certain which coin is being discussed, you can clarify by asking if the mean Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash. Remember, BCash is worth around one tenth of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:36:06
Exactly. I am so glad that people like you exist.
@_date: 2018-06-23 18:22:55
I did roughly the same, sold ETH at 1200. Are you ever gonna buy back in? I'm planning to, but not yet.
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:56:08
There is always a situation, my friend. Bitcoin at 20k is a situation. Bitcoin  at 1k is another situation.
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:29:28
Who's to say what will be the price tomorrow. If bitcoin is going to 100k then I don't give a rats ass whether I buy at 6.4k or 7k or even 8k.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:09:56
It's not your job to prop u the market. You have a duty to yourself first. That said, buying is your business. I'm waiting for 3.5k
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:12:47
I think we bottom out around 3k and build a long term support base there before reaching 30k some time in 2019 maybe 2020.
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:13:37
I didn't sell that high but I sold well above 14000. Are you ever planning to get back in?

Volume is low because people are leaving the market. People are leaving the market because bitcoin is in a downtrend. Bitcoin is in a downtrend because sellers outnumbered buyers at the 20k level. What more do you need to know?

@_date: 2018-06-05 06:07:11
Ok, so we must be in an uptrend then. Even though price has been consistently trending down for the last month.
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:02:43
I think we got more to go, but 6k btc is still an excellent long term investment. Stick with the big 3 though (BTC ETH LTC) the rest is mostly garbage.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:47:15
I think 2k is possible. I think the bottom will probably be below 3k. We are not going to go above 7k for a very very long time.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:25:29
lmao u tell him
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:57:38
I think we probably won't hit the bottom for at least 6 months yet, or maybe a year.  I would stop buying for now. You can sell if you want to, but since you've invested so much, I would definitely buy back in lower.
Please don't listen to the moonboys. We are heading into a post-bubble bear market. Expect to see prices trend sideways to down for a solid 6 months or more. Prices will not bounce back to 8 or 9k for a long time. Sorry.

@_date: 2018-06-26 03:35:37
Come on guys! Stop moping about the price. It will bottom out somewhere. Either you believe in the project or you don't.
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:46:39
That's called wash trading. I don't think more people are becoming hodlrs. Instead, I think hodlrs are retiring and cashing in. I think we're gonna break 6k support and bottom out around 3.5k. After we bottom out for real, we're gonna accumulate for a while before beginning a new bull run in late 2018 or 2019
EDIT: It is highly possible that we bottom out significantly lower than 3500. It is also possible that 6k is the bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:46:21
I don't think you understand. Bitcoin is overvalued. I'm not shilling it. My point is that one should wait for it to bottom out and then begin buying. Bitcoin is not going to zero. This downtrend does have a bottom and when it bottoms, a new bull trend will begin. Most people who lost money did so not only because bitcoin was in a bubble that popped, but also because they did not practice sane or safe investment strategies.
Most "buy the dip" people are telling that the dip will be short lived and that you should shoot your wad into it all at once. I'm saying that this dip WILL last a LONG time. If you can't see that there's a difference between buying at 15k and buying at 5k or 3k, then you probably don't believe in bitcoin's potential. In that case, why are you even here? Why do you even care? You should have never touched bitcoin in the first place.
I've been predicting that bitcoin would go below 6k for a long time now. I believe that it will go significantly lower, probably to around 4k, maybe lower. Even a drop to 1k is conceivable. That's why I advise people to practice sane investing strategies like dollar cost averaging rather than knife catching or mortgaging your entire house to buy the peak at 19k.
So, bitcoin has value. It's real. But it's still overvalued. Just because it had a bubble doesn't mean it's a ponzi scheme. If you don't think that bitcoin has any value, you need to do your homework and read about distributed ledger and decentralized consensus technology. This bubble is comparable to the internet bubble, but if you'll notice, the internet hasn't gone away. Buying *after the collapse* of the bubble presented an excellent buying opportunity, especially in stocks of companies that survived such as Apple and Amazon.
I'm going to update my post to add a warning. I do agree that positivity can breed hopium in desperate bag hodlers.
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:25:10
yeah we're gonna do a reverse 2017 for a while until the market cycle resets

Congrats for not investing more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:34:13
Yes, but the first reaction to 5800 was very strong; in a month we rallied to 11k. Next time, the reaction was weaker. We didn't even make it to 10k. Next time, we won't even make it to 9k, and that's if we rally at all.
Mark my words, 5800 is not the bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:15:37
you act like you've never seen Bart Simpson before
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:36:29
I thought this was old news? Bitcoin is pretty clearly not a security.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:32:40
True. Well, I think that crypto will eventually see some adoption, so it could be a long term investment. This market is full of idiots who never traded based on fundamentals. They're only now getting the kick in the pants that they deserved.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:55:41
low volume? sounds like another market I could mention...
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:21:11
be careful what you wish for
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:55:40
I think we'll go much lower than 5k. I'm actually really excited about the bear market because I want to buy cheap. LOL
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:53:44
I really hope bitcoin can stay above 6k
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:01:59
Probably a smart strategy.
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:29:01
Maybe they'll stop selling when the maniacs stop overvaluing?
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:40:15
Some people are predicting that bitcoin will bottom out not at 6k but at 3.5k. If those folks are correct, you may have one hell of a dip-buying opportunity.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:08:07
That chart is probably a bunch of crap. There's a lot of ways you can fit one graph over the other.
That said, I think bitcoin is going significantly below 6k (probably below 4k imo).
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:21:19
At this point, I can't tell if you're mad because I still have faith in bitcoin, or because I'm saying that its going down.
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:07:06
I invested more than I could afford to lose, but I made off bigly because I was smart and sold the top.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:38:47
I don't mean *right* now, as in today, or even this week or month. A break in market structure is an extremely bearish development that should not be taken lightly. I mean that excellent long term buying opportunities will present themselves in this bear market.
However, given the gullibility and naivete of certain permabulls, I have added a warning at the bottom of the post which I hope will clarify my meaning and discourage people from buying here.
If they want to pour their life savings into a falling asset, I can't stop them and that's not my business.
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:35:16
Maybe ppl should make sure that what they buy is worth 20k
To be fair, I did almost no research when I bought. (around 6k)
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:01:40
It doesn't have to replace fiat. It will probably just exist alongside it. The cryptos that will replace fiat haven't been created yet, and will probably be designed to behave more like Tether or TUSD.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:00:41
I'm still long term bullish on bitcoin, but it's better to wait out the bear market than try to catch a falling knife.
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:39:18
Lmao. GO LTC.
Actually, Ltc sees a lot of use on the darknet. Also, get used a lot due to low transaction costs and time. So, it's valuation is justified by its network.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:41:13
That's fine. You have no obligation to stick around.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:07:34
Sold out in January, lol. I just want this market to bottom out so that I can obtain some cheap coins.
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:59:16
Exactly. I would love to put several thousand into btc not as a speculative investment but as a hedge. The entire cryptographically-secure aspect of bitcoin is incredibly appealing to me.
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:11:42
Nice. Actually, legos can be an appreciating asset, unlike lambos.
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:51:59
So, just as rich as before, but now you feel dumb for not taking profit?
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:33:22
I kinda still think btc could be overvalued by up to a factor of 2. Sorry that's my view. Its spot value is inflated by idiots and fomo buyers. 3-4k is a perfectly reasonable price for bitcoin.
Shorting obviously hasn't been futile, and in fact has been very profitable.
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:01:36
Funny. A month ago, the permabulls told me there was zero chance of going below 6k. 2 months before that, they swore up and down and sideways that we were permanently done with the low 8k region.
And yet here we are. The market doesn't give a fuck what YOU think.
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:57:20

@_date: 2018-06-13 20:27:48
I sold eth at 1200 and ltc around 230. Not a shred of regret. In fact, I have very little but contempt for the greater fools and whiners who bought at 18k, are selling at 6k, and are now screaming about how bitcoin "failed", "is dead" or hurt them. They were planning to dump their bags on someone else, were they not?
I'm waiting out the bear market because I'm a true believer. I still haven't bought in yet. I might buy in when we get down to 3k, but I suspect we might go even lower.
@_date: 2019-02-15 15:39:26
I don't think bitcoin has bottomed yet, but if you hodled all of 2018 and are selling now, you're a moron.
@_date: 2019-02-07 05:27:44
Bitcoin is never going to 1,000,000. Maybe 100k but not 1 million.

Maybe. I'm not sure. Most people thought it had bottomed at 6k lol and then they got rekt.
@_date: 2019-04-06 23:25:06
I think its a lot easier to predict where the bottom of the bear market will be than the top of the next bull market.
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:09:34
Lol. I stupidly daytraded until my buy-in point was more like 9.5k, but then I sold out before the crash. If I hadn't done that my profit would have been zero. Turns out day trading isn't so bad after all.
@_date: 2018-03-17 06:23:22
My feel as well. In the meantime, this is the time to cash out and wait.

I'm still a bear. I think the market is still too speculative and volatile. Also, the massive selloffs from 11400 are very discouraging. I think the shift from bear to bull may be more gradual.

@_date: 2018-03-14 17:19:47
Some people are sick of the ups and downs. When you own thousands of dollars of bitcoin, it can be nerve-wracking to lose and gain thousands of dollars within hours. They are selling just to avoid the uncertainty.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:56:10
Nope. not happening. Gonna take a week to hit 10k again, minimum. Could be 6 months too.
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:50:02
This bear market will take a while to run its course. If you want to play things your way that's fine, but if bitcoin drops significantly, you will be burned.
@_date: 2018-03-06 05:13:59
Someone should pay 100$ for a satoshi sometime, making bitcoin's market cap unbelievably huge.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:28:14
The price is going down because btc failed to breach 12k, and it failed to breach 12k because the trade volume is too low. The trade volume is low because the money that drove it to 20k was purely speculative. 
I sold when btc was at 11.6k because I knew it probably couldn't breach 12k. You stayed in and lost 1000$ for every btc you own. I don't understand how it is that I'm the nut.
Btw, it's going below 10k most likely. It's still not too late to sell.
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:00:24
Yeah I certainly wish I had bought bitcoin back then...
But the fact that I should have bought it then doesn't mean that it's not crashing now. And if your buy-in point was that far back, I'm sure you feel much less pressure to sell than I do.
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:08:05
Lol that would give a whole new meaning to pump and dump.

shit thats some good hopium where did you get it
@_date: 2018-03-17 06:24:11
Yeah that growth was crazy. I got spoiled and also got a serious case of fomo because my first exposure to btc was when it was 7k
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:40:09
I don't think its helpful to use reverse psychology in this case. The way you're acting is idiotic. Nevertheless I wish you the best of luck dealing with depression.
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:00:49
That would push up the price, for one. A lot of governments dont like crypto already, the last thing they want is for increasing price to attract investors. Also, it would funnel money to crypto holders, thus increasing inflation.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:29:32
It was not a guess. Any fool could see that the breakout was weak and that the resistance was too strong. The only way we're gonna break out for real is when volume returns to January levels.
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:30:50
Hell yeah. I may be a bitcoin bear now, but I know that the real bubble probably hasn't even started yet. Plus I have held btc at a loss before (when it went from 7800 to 5500) so I have earned my stripes.
Also, I feel like it's too dangerous to hold an asset as volatile as bitcoin during a bear market. Really, the bear market won't end until we get back to 13k.
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:16:42
On high volume days you're not really going to have stability. You get only one or the other.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:01:39
It probably won't. A lot of experts are still anticipating 20k by the end of this year. If you can hodl this entire dip, then you deserve a medal.
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:16:16

@_date: 2018-03-11 18:05:25
Idk about that but I think it will certainly attempt 10-10.5k
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:49:28
Very nice video. I have a few questions.
Why do you think 2500 will be the low? How certain are you that we will actually reach that?
I made some money on crypto in november and december, and I want to get back in at as low as possible a price, but I don't want to catch a falling knife either. What do you suggest?
edit: watched the whole video. I think you're basically right. I guess we just gotta  wait and see what happens. A stable price is what I'm exactly what I'm looking for.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:55:58
This bear market may be comparable to 2014's bear market, actually. I expect the next several months to involve a lot of sell-offs, sideways trading, stabilization, and rallies that get sold quickly.
@_date: 2018-03-24 06:53:21
you better be careful with ur money. child porn scares people and its the kind of thing that could take btc to very low lows.
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:49:09
I've been watching the volume too. I think we're going to move down, but I'm far from certain about that. Volume can mean that the current trend is losing strength, or that it is consolidating for a continuation. Since we're in a downtrend since 20k, and locally since 9.1k, I think we're going to try to move down. Lets see if buyers step in, however.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:54:42
I think it can go down to 7500 (opinion of this guy on youtube who predicted sub-9k when btc was at 11.2k) or 6k (my personal suspicion, also shared by quite a few bears).
Either way, I'm staying out of this bloodbath until it gets all sorted out. The only time I'll catch a falling knife is if I can sit at my computer to make sure the price goes up after I buy.
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:38:51

@_date: 2018-03-06 20:07:59
I hate to be a prophet of doom, and I respect your dedication to your investment. However, you have to understand that not everyone is a hodler like you. If you are a hodler, you must also accept that you may become a bag holder.

If 11200 breaks, I doubt 11k will hold. Next meaningful support is 10800 I think.
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:08:56
Most altcoins are overvalued... btc is the real deal. Only a few altcoins have real value.

We're in a bear market, dude. The drops are everywhere.
@_date: 2018-03-17 04:28:34
That sounds pretty unrealistic to me. I don't expect things to get bullish again until April to midyear, or even later.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:10:46
There's more to life than money, although losing a lot of money can be very hard to handle. I suggest you talk to someone if you're in distress.

I think its possible to say the least but far from certain
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:37:07
I see your point, but I think we are headed into a bear market similar to 2008. I think the price and volatility will have to flatten out significantly before things pick up again. Basically, the market will have to drive out all the speculators before things can get moving again. Things *may* get back to ATH by summer, but don't count on it.
That said, I am very pro-bitcoin. Do you think I would be on this sub or investing 1000s of $$$ if I weren't?
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:07:27
Me either. People were driven out because the price stopped going up, but the adoption rate is increasing more than ever. 20k bitcoin is just a glimpse of the future. One day, 20k will be a fair value for btc not just a speculative bubble value.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:11:36
Alright, you win. I hereby forbid myself from proclaiming that anything is "highly possible" ever again.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:53:25
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:26:26
It's safe. In fact, it's the safest exchange in crypto. I have personally deposited and withdrawn money from them exceeding 1000$. I think they're also FDIC insured but there might be some technicalities associated with that. In the end, there are only two safe ways to store money: in a cold wallet where only you control the keys, or in a bank.
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:35:01
Me neither. I was smart enough to smell this bear market coming. You got any plans to reinvest?
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:42:08
In my case, I sold out before it dropped below 13k, and I'm waiting with my money until I feel it is safe again. If I buy above 13k (looks doubtful that that will happen) then so be it.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:12:01
Whatever. Have a nice day. Sorry for your loss.
BTW The tether fud hasn't even hit the fan yet. Be wary of that sometime this year.
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:00:00
There are too many miners given the fact that btc is still in early adoption phase... miners will have to sort out their own problems
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:29:08
True, but the future is unwritten. Who knows what will happen in the end?
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:37:32
Damn dude it fell even more than I thought. I hope you sold.
@_date: 2018-03-11 07:35:23
I think we'll be seeing all time highs then. For now, we're still in bubble collapse phase.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:33:40
6.. You're a bag holder and the bubble is popping.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:20:18
I agree with OP. I'm scared to buy in right now. Of course, I'm sad I didn't buy in earlier, but you can't see the future. Anyway, I sold out before the crash (from 14k to9k) so I'm still ahead of where I would be.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:58:36
Not me. I switched to ether a while ago and sold that at 1200. Then I endured a few painful days while it went up to 1400, and the rest is history.
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:23:57
if you see this reddit comment and sell really quick you might be able to catch the tail end of the bear pennant

Conceivably, it could be as little as 1 cent. If bitcoin stopped being used, and in the very last transaction someone paid 1 cent for 1600 satoshis, then its market cap would forever be 1 trillion dollars.
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:15:21
I think it will eventually stabilize, maybe after some months.
@_date: 2019-01-20 23:43:43
I, too, believe in bitcoin but these overly optimistic shitposts are discouraging as fuck.
@_date: 2018-03-13 05:17:42
Well, always keep a stop loss. That's all I can say.
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:10:44
I think so too. In time, adoption will send volume and interest back up. However, I foresee some boring or even heartbreaking weeks ahead.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:56:07
uh, that would be the desire to not lose thousands of dollars in a matter of minutes
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:10:46
I think 500 is unrealistic, but I think it could definitely hit 3500. I think we are in the beginning of a serious bear market.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:33:25
Inevitably some of them will be sold.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:51:23
we're in a bear market and 9.4-9.6k is strong resistance. Plus, we're pretty much gonna be sub 9k until the G20 summit. Put it all together, and its not hard to see why 10k is gonna be hard to retake, barring some unusually good news.
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:08:08
I don't know if we'll ever get there, but we may see 1 sat = 1 penny.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:57:23
teetering on the edge of the abyss may have been a bit strong. The situation is very lukewarm.
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:11:27
They would never see it that way. They would see crypto as a risky investment at best and monopoly money at worst.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:08:01
The whole crypto situation is teetering on the edge of the abyss right now. Bitcoin needs to hold 10k before february's close, from what I hear.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:23:17
It's not hard to understand. If bitcoin keeps getting rejected at 9k, it will test lower supports again.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:43:35
It's gonna go down form where you bought, I can tell you that. Also up, if you wait long enough.
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:21:15
Hey, I'm the one who sold out at 11.6 before it crashed to 10.9. Maybe I'm not a dunce. My gut is we will see 10.3 again, and buying will resume a bit from there. But I think we will see sub 10k again in a week.
My view is that bitcoin will win in the end, but why should I buy at 11k when I know the market will move down from there?
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:24:58
Sounded pretty bullish to me. I guess we'll just have to wait and see...
@_date: 2018-03-17 04:19:48
I don't own any btc right now. I'm waiting for the bear market to get going and then I'm going to ease into it. So, the bear market isn't scaring me too much. Oft quoted trading advice is that one should buy into weakness and sell into strength.
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:12:39
Don't get your hopes up. But, don't lose hope. A wise man does not need a false reality to be happy.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:50:33
What if bitcoin goes back to 18,500 briefly and you refuse to sell, anticipating 25k, but it plunges to 10k again?
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:07:25
I mean, if it sustains below. It only broke it briefly not very decisive.
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:56:34
Yeah I disagree with OP. I'm going to watch the market for a few days. The bear market may well not be over.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:54:48
A "nut" who happened to be absolutely correct about short term market behavior. Right.
Bitcoin is in a small bounce right now, but it's not going to last. Sell while it's still at 10.7. We're going to go down to 10.3 most likely, where we may see a bigger bounce. But I don't think that one will last either. Sub 10k times are ahead, my friend.
@_date: 2018-03-23 07:19:42
Btc is about to plunge from 8.4k to 8k or maybe lower. If you want to HODL, you can sell now and buy in later.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:20:19
yep because past results guarantee future performance.
If anything, you should have learned from the bull/bear cycle that we can easily expect a full year of bearishness, maybe more.
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:02:40
OP said per day, but I meant per second. That's only a comparison to ACH bank transfers though.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:23:19
well anyway my magic 8 ball is pretty reliable. It's telling me there's gonna be a drop to around 8800, but a move upward afterwards could probably bring us to the level we're at currently. So, now is still quite likely a good time to sell, but I'm not 100% sure anymore.
@_date: 2018-03-06 03:59:14
No clue. Probably above 6k though, but it depends on the persistence of the bear market. Aka, a protracted bear market like in 2008 could bring bitcoin lower. However, I think adoption looks closer than ever so I think the bear market would be much shorter and the bottom much higher.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:11:51
well, if it goes up, good for you. I'm still waiting to buy in lower. You must realize that bitcoin can go down harder than you think.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:28:07
nope, bought around 6.6k. Wish I had sold at 20k, too. Back then I was more optimistic, like you. If I hadn't sold at 14k I wouldn't have made hardly anything.
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:36:23
Around 4000 or so, roughly. That would be more if it gets used by machines a lot making automated purchased, but less if lightning network comes in.
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:33:28
I think so but idk. That might actually be visa
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:37:51
Is shorting bitcoin at 6k still futile?
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:22:36
Yeah my bearish theory has been invalidated. It looked like we were heading down. We actually did head down, but way less than I thought.
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:09:18
I'll post another comment when I'm proven right. If I'm wrong, you can laugh in my face.
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:57:02
I don't think you understand the psychology of the heavy holders. They would have sold long ago if they wanted to. They knew that 19k was unsustainable, for example, and would have sold in order to lock in their gains. They didn't. Why? I believe that they believe in the technology as a long term investment. If they didn't sell when bitcoin went to 1k and then crashed, why would they sell at 10k? My point is that if bitcoin is as big as the superwhales think it is, then selling at even 100k is actually foolish. If adopted as a world currency, it truly could hit 1 million or more.
That said, I don't actually own any bitcoin right now. I think the price may drop significantly in the short term. Even if it doesn't, I'll be content if I have to buy at 10k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:18:25
Yeah, except I'm affirming as a statement what you posed as a question.
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:54:19
no lol never a dull moment with btc
just to be clear I own 12 ltc so I'm not tryna be a former-coiner or a fudster
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:06:36
The pirce just keeps ratcheting up. I think a lot of people are initiating long positions. Long term buyers are very good for the overall health of the market.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:39:30
I hate to join the fud, but I think 5k is in the cards. We could be heading into a bear market. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:06:23
I think that your opinion is not based on a careful analysis of available information. True, there are drawbacks to various cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, but the technology is here to stay. In time, I think you will be amazed to see how the tech evolves.
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:55:48
It's too soon to tell. I think its possible, but unlikely that we will see 11.5k again before the week's close. I don't know how far down this will go, but most likely sub 10.8k
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:30:35
Sounds like you've never been depressed, and therefore can't have compassion on someone who is. I tell you what, you will get depressed one day and it will hit you hard.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:46:54
The fact that you are unable to detect your own idiocy indicates an additional dimension of idiocy. A sort of meta-idiocy, if you will.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:43:42
Time will tell. I am deeply uncertain about the future of btc, as anyone should be. The expectation that it will endlessly increase is childish, yet I fully believe that it has the potential to hit 50k within two years. Right now, I am in fiat as I feel that that is the safest position for now.
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:53:36
It's a trustless and decentralized digital ledger. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:43:17
In a lot of ways, yes, it's a slot machine. It's primary use case is as an investment vehicle. However, it will most likely become used as a currency increasingly during the coming years, and so its value will skyrocket. This makes it attractive to many investors, who are willing to suffer short-term losses of 30% or more in hopes of making much, much larger gains.
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:21:50
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:43:55
Looking at my ~~charts~~ magic 8 ball, a move below 9k looks certain. We're at 9.8k and it looks like a big bear flag, exactly what preceded the drop from 11.2k to 10.6k and 10.7k to 9.8k.
I wouldn't sell if I were you though, because if I were you I'd be a dumbass.
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:33:53
What news dude... you may have just missed it.
There's so much news about btc no-one can know what news you refer to.
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:27:00
I'm with him though. It clearly failed to break the last high, despite chart technicals being on the side of the bulls. If the volume isn't there the price will drop.
@_date: 2018-03-11 07:46:00
Don't buy. We're heading into a multi month bear market. Wait for the price to stabilize. Eventually even the traders will get sick of crypto, and then its value will truly reflect utility + hodlers.
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:34:20
Hey, not everyone has to be a permabull.
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:46:48
It's complicated. Remember that the price of bitcoin is driven by demand, not fundamentals or news or anything else. Now that bitcoin is thoroughly in the shadow of 20k, a lot of short and medium term investors have lost interest. It will take a lot of money to drive it back up to its previous highs.
If you want to stay in bitcoin, you need to decide upon your investment strategy. Hodling is one strategy but it is not the only strategy. However, it may be a bit late to sell now as it would have been better to sell near 11k. I expect that we weill see this current downward price action continue for a few more days, followed by a breakout above 10k or breakdown below 9k. However, this is not necessarily a reason to leave bitcoin and I think it is highly possible that we will see 20k-30k bitcoin later this year. However, it will be months before we see that again. So, you need to decided if you are an investor, hodler, or a trader, and in what timeframe you will focus.
I currently don't own any bitcoin, but that's only because I anticipate a short term continuation of this dip.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:39:21


OP is a robot, confirmed
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:48:07
I think you're overly confident in your bull stance. The market has fallen by just over 70% from an overbought ATH, and it is not clear whether we have hit the bottom. The price has smashed through several supports and bucked some major bullish trends. This is cause for concern.
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:24:49

edit: just bought back in. lol.
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:43:54
I know that's what you think, but trading volume is way down on crypto exchanges, too. People aren't as excited over crypto because of all this sideways trading. In time, the volume will most likely return. For now, expect difficult times ahead.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:53:14
I think that you have to take into account market pressure on top of news and tech. News can stanch the bleeding of a bear market or speed up a bull run, but it can't be counted on to stop a freight train of a market trend. And also, if you think that people ever wanted anything besides money, you're sadly mistaken.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:42:26
Tell them, don't worry you always keep a tight stop-loss
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:45:05
Its not the god damn charts. It was that first drop from 11540 to 11200 that told me something was up. But I never suspected it would hit this hard. This is not the bottom, btw. We're going below 9k most likely.
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:43:56
Litecoin has been proven over many years. That alone justifies a market cap of at least 2x BCash
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:42:55
A fool and his fiat are soon parted.
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:45:31
Basically, it has to get to the point where people trust bitcoin so much that they fell more safe than when they own fiat.
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:35:39
yes. until it doesnt. then it will go up. until a new downtrend starts.
In order to give you something to chew on, I predict that btc will bottom somewhere below 4.5k.
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:53:19
You are a moron and the dump that is coming will render you a permanent bag hodler.
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:39:03
That's not true at all. Not only do I not want to lose money unnecessarily, I would also rather miss out than get burned. I certainly don't know that the price will go to 3k anyway, its just a belief.
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:21:19
I don't know, but my guess is not unfounded. The price has jumped up sliglty (did not expect that) but I suspect it's a random pump designed to suck the money out of FOMO buyers. If it gets up to 8.9k before the day closes, then it's probably not a random pump.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:51:27
Well, if you truly believe in btc, now is the time to increase your investments and decrease your average buy in price. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:37:00

It's a market correction, but by the looks of it... could take us down to 10400 levels, or lower. Hard to say.

@_date: 2018-04-21 19:51:10
Fiat is not worthless. It has much more trust behind it. Bitcoin is a P2P currency, but it's primary use is as a speculative asset. If you can't see that, you're blind.
And the only way speculators will be rekt is if the price drops... which is what I'm warning about.
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:29:11
When a few actors buy or sell in massive amounts and move the market by a significant percentage, that is manipulation. It is idiotic to think that all price movement are organic. That said, I believe that the manipulations are taking hold and that the market is beginning to move organically now.
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:31:01
I like bitcoin, I'm just warning people to be careful. Bcash is even more dangerous and will likely dissappear over the coming months or years.
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:05:43
I owned bitcoin before I owned eth. I sorta stopped being a permabull when bitcoin went from 20k to 10k in a week. It made me wake up and realize that btc wasn't worth 10k.
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:52:42
When bitcoin dropped from 19k to 10k, that was when I first realized that bitcoin wan't actually worth 10k.
@_date: 2018-04-20 20:23:20
If you're thinking that the bubble will return and you will be so rich that you don't need to go to college, be very careful my friend. My sources predict that this rally could get as high as 11k before turning around and dumping don to 4k or so. It's what happened in 2014. Just be careful.
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:39:36
Depends on your buy-in price. I have sources which predict that this rally will fail around 11k, giving us a triple top somewhere around 11.5k, and will push us finally below 6k
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:29:55
If you're a true believer, then you're also ready for 6k, 3k, 1k.
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:57:56
I sold my ETH around 1200. I'm looking to buy back in eventually but not now.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:31:44
I'm waiting until we breakout of 12k to buy. Until then, we're rangebound between 11k and 6k.
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:31:40
what r u smokin?
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:12:58
I think it's gonna drop too, but you have to see things in terms of probability.
If it goes up, it will *probably* stall out around 9k. If it goes down, it *may* go down as far as 6.6k again... or lower. Or, it may go down to around 7600, turn around and start making a pattern of higher highs and higher lows. There are many ways this can play out.
If you want to sell now, its not as simple as recognizing whether you want to sell. Unless you want to cash out of crypto entirely, you most likely want to buy in lower. So, you need both an exit and an entrance strategy. Bitcoin has a nasty habit of turning around when you least suspect it.
Disclaimer: I am relatively bearish on bitcoin, and I haven't owned any coin for weeks. I'm looking for what I feel is a safe reentry price. I sold at 14k, so I'm ahead of the market.
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:06:21
I didn't lose money. If anything, the one crying will be you if btc goes down.
@_date: 2018-04-22 07:20:18
don't worry about it, bro. I sold my ETH around 1200 and endured a week of pain while it rallied to 1400. Now it's barely half of what I sold it at. ha what a joke. This market is soooo deeply speculative its ridiculous. There's a chance you may see a rally to 11k but I believe that this bubble still hasn't really popped yet. I hope you bought lower than what you sold at.
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:22:26
areful bro. Lots of bulltraps everywhere. The price will turn down for a retest most likely.
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:30:17
Yup, the 30 minute 1000$ pump was completely genuine and organic. And the manipulator definitely didn't use robots to pump the price whenever it started to slump.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:02:31
The whales were only pumping it so they can get out at a higher price before they dump down to 5.7k
@_date: 2018-04-22 08:03:46
when whales buy, the buy OTC (over-the-counter) because buying on exchanges pumps the price, causing massive order slippage. When they buy 3k btc on an exchange and pump the price to by 500 or 1000 points, thats manipulation. I'm not saying you can't make money off of it, but it *is* manipulation.
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:28:45
I think its gonna drop but this could take weeks to play out. People are manipulating btc very hard.
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:54:30
Missing a bull market is not a risk. The only risk is losing your money. Protect capital first, profits second.
I don't know if we'll hit 4k, but the big money wants to see volatility settle down before they jump in. The volatility we've seen the last few months is scaring them off.
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:30:36
My words are a warning, not a guarantee. A good trader should be prepared to handle any action of the market, both downwards and upwards.

@_date: 2018-04-26 19:38:04
When Bcash double my jaw dropped. I don't know why it happened exactly, but I strongly suspect that people are tired of boring ol' bitcoin and want the insane volatility of the low marketcap cryptos--a sure sign of an immature markets is investing based on price performance and not fundamentals.
Anyhow, would you like to join a crypto-themed discord group? Our sentiment is sorta similar to what I just posted. We're not a bunch of     types.

We're not in a bull market until we break 12.2k you imbeciles.
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:09:07
My sources tell me we're gonna see a spike to 11k but we will then get a massive selloff which will finally send us back to 3k... months of accumulation by big players ensure before we start the next bull run. Like 2014.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:35:20
Having balls =/= buying high and selling low
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:30:52
If you want to play it completely safe, wait for a breakout above 12k. Btc will remain rangebound until it does this.
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:49:45
No, its very hard to control market manipulation as it happens in all markets everywhere. Even gold is manipulated.
All I 'm saying is that the rallies we had (7k-&gt;8k and 8.5k-&gt;8.9k) were highly inorganic.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:57:17
I would just say that bitcoin is a copy of the original that has a lot of followers, but still a smaller following than the original. I would also point out that it's improvements dont change the fundamental flaws with bitcoin, such as the transaction bandwidth being orders of magnitude lower than other payment processors e.g. visa.
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:26:06
I'm sure you care very much about the price, as bitcoins most's prominent use is as a speculative asset. I believe that bitcoin is significantly overvalued right now, and that as speculative interest wanes, the price will plummet to the point where it is supported by its actual utility. I believe this level is below 6k.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:12:15
Do you own btc? If so, hold. If not, wait for a correction and then consider buying. Don't buy above 10.5k, set a tight stop loss.
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:33:47
No-one knows when the bear market ends. It may be over, but it may not. If you buy high and the bear market isn't over, woe be unto you.

@_date: 2018-04-21 19:31:31
It's not transactions that are shady. Its movement with exchanges such as bitfinex (that's where most of the manipulation happens) and also other exchanges such as gdax and bitmex.

I don't think weve hit the bottom of the bear market yet, so its probably ont a good time to buy. Its always better to buy on the upslope and miss out than the downslope and get wrecked. But, the money thats buying now is a lot smarter than the money that was buyig at 18k or even 11k

why the heck would the institutions bring us to 100k? Which institutions will buy at 80k and say "gee we missed out, gotta get that last 25% profit"?
Millennials on reddit are what are keeping btc afloat. Without them we'd already be sub 6k.

You are wise for being able to sell when everyone else is screaming BUY BUY BUY!

I'm no expert. But I don't think there are any fundamentals except the lightning network that justify a blazing comeback for btc. The lightning network isnt even fully implemented yet anyway.

yes, I assumed you probably weren't a programmer and therefore wouldn't be familiar with !=

Well, it doesnt take a genius to figure out that no-one would have expected a 1000$ rally in 30 minutes, given where the market was. They also didn't have to have illegal access to the order books to know that such a rally would result in triggered stops and liquidation.

Another concern I have is that whoever is buying that bitcoin can also sell it... massively.
And they will.
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:27:10
No, I would never short bitcoin unless from 10k+

Lightning wont work because it requires routing through a network of untrustworthy nodes.

I'm glad you had the sense to buy below 6k. I knew that support wouldn't hold.

Says the crypto advocates who support a network that averages around ~10 tps and uses 1% of the world energy.

It's from a University meme page. The university talks about fearless ideas, so the students mocked it by making a rule that if you comment "my fearless idea deletes this" on a post and it gets enough likes, the post gets removed by the mod team.
