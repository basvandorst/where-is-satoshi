Am not exactly sure on the date, but it was either the first gawker article or I believe a 60Mins feature. Really back in the day - Silk Road and Gox era. Either way, I remember following it for some time, seeing prices around $3 dollar range and go up to $8...thinking I missed out already. 
The speculative side of me was immediately curious. But I didn't really fully understand it yet. It was actually only around last year that I started reading up, and it suddenly all clicked that this was huge. 
A lot of aha moments came from the blog posts of VC folk - Chris Dixon, Albert Wenger etc... just realizing that it's actually really not about the 'coin', but the 'ledger' (both integral parts, but viewing it from the ledger side is the more interesting view)
Richard Brown, a comp scientist from IBM, also had a video that sealed the deal for me -- I also remember reading a BTC Geek article on Decentralized Autonomous Corporations and  just getting my mind seriously blown by the idea - gave me goose bumps...
TLDR - knew about it early but didn't understand it. But through a lot of reading...started to add up.

Even in spontaneous, grassroots movements (Civil rights etc etc) -- leaders emerge to spearhead and coordinate that group.
Teams will always have leaders. Sports teams have coaches. Orchestras have conductors. This doesn’t give them special privilege. It’s just a role in the team. But that role is there for a reason — I’ve been part of great teams with awesome leaders and they provide a valuable and necessary service. 
Leadership != Rulers/dictators/tyrants. Big distinction. Maybe we're arguing semantics here. 
Society will always have some sort of leadership. Whether you call that new system a government / core team / task force — who knows. It will evolve, probably far from what we know today with these new technologies and that’s a good thing.
@_date: 2014-03-14 15:23:58
Exactly that - because it's programmable. It's open to evolution. And because it's open and decentralized, it is also permission-less. Some kid in a garage will come up with something crazy and innovative and we don't know what that is yet -- just like we didn't know that the Googles and Uber's/AirBnb's or even ecommerce for that matter would take off when we were staring at 50KB modems and still using Yahoo directories to web surf. We're already seeing this happen (see Vitalik Buterin, colored coins etc etc)

Individual debt in itself is not bad.
Only two questions: 
1) What are you using the debt on? (business/education? or bling/strippers?). 
2) Can you afford it? (does it even make sense mathematically)
1 is a value judgement. But 2 has harder limits. There is a boundary you breach where it starts to not make any sense regardless of what you spend it on. 
Society in debt is also not bad -- if you're using the debt for good and if the mathematics makes sense.

What's befuddling to most is what being "digital" means — and how to value that. It is an interesting question.


Being Digital (1995)
Chapter I: The DNA of Information
by Nicholas Negroponte
Founder of the MIT Media Lab
Questions to ponder:
1. What is a *bit*? (What does it represent? What do they build?)
2. Does a bit have *intrinsic* value?
3. Whether it’s zero or not — do all bits have *equal* value? 
4. Can *this* string of bits have more value than *that* string of bits?
5. Since bits are easily replicable, what gives them value?
Compare with atoms. Food for thought.

When I first read about the idea of a DAO/DAC. 
I believe it was actually an article that Vitalk wrote in bitcoin magazine. I had been following bitcoin for quite a while but that was my first true “oh shit……” moment. The idea of automation from the top, concept of autonomous software etc…..unreal - but also sense that these techs are inevitable.
Actually I believe bitcoin has a real shot at success but I also don't believe it's guaranteed. However I'm pretty sure about the broad stroke idea -- that crypto and decentralized systems will play a HUGE part in the future.
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:47:05

@_date: 2014-01-17 16:26:17


And then that police sheriff would start to build an organization, become corrupt etc.. Sounds a lot like the beginnings of a government. The people were supposed to "empower" current governments too remember?
As you say, people are self-organizing. That's why civilizations formed governments in the first place. Even in highly effective, flat, organizations, people still need leaders.
But I agree with the sentiment. With developments in technology (decentralized/disruptive technologies) I believe it will force Governments to change if not overhaul their whole structure. Governments will be forced to innovate, rapidly. They'll need to compete with these emergent technologies. But I don't think it'll mean complete end. Centralization/leadership is useful in the right doses and the right areas.

not using shiny bitcoin tokens as the story photo?? what is this madness??
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:42:59
Goals are very different. This is not an alt-coin that just took many years. 
Bitcoin goal was to create digital cash via a decentralized ledger. Maidsafe goal is to literally rebuild the whole internet model from scratch. I'd be more surprised if it only took them a year or two.
2006 is pre-satoshi. Bitcoin success just provided them with model for   incentive mechanism that could work. It's not even blockchain/ledger based - so totally different objectives and approach.
But in the end - yes, agree with both points. They are on testnet1 and going up the roadmap to end of year release. You should wait till fully functional beta is up to evaluate. We're all speculating till then.
Edit: grammar

Reminds me of this story (The Zen master):
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:19:46
Can't really compare the ipad "release" with bitcoin's. iPad's release had the iPhone preceding it + the usual, worldwide, product launch marketing coming from a large company, multiplied by the Apple/Jobs brand magic. Bitcoin's "release" if you can even call it that, was to an obscure cryptographic mail list with just a handful of people.
That said I believe that adoption will be slower than most people think, and if it does, it will be because of altogether different reasons than for buying stuff that things dollars can already buy. my .02.

Finance, just like communication before the internet, has always been a closed platform. Meaning there were no means to innovate on it without "permission". The internet made it an open platform: some random kid in a garage has the opportunity (note: not the guarantee!) to reach a million people in an instant, whether it's a stupid youtube video, or a new, breakthrough search engine etc.
The comparison is not just a "just wait for tech to improve 10 years" which is short sighted, but rather the nature of how it improves. Bitcoin is not money for the internet, but rather the internet of money. It is an open platform that anyone can build on. And we're already seeing the momentum of startups, different unique apps being built, beyond just "coins". 
Platforms that are open to third-party developers have the following characteristic: it’s hard to think of important use cases before they are built, and hard to find examples where important use cases weren’t developed after they were built.

They never did a pre-sale so there is no "scheme". There's nothing to buy. In fact they don't believe in tokens at all - they even call their internal tokens "junk". Very different paradigm people on this sub are unused to. And OP is wrong -- whatever criticism you have, you can't say it 'feels' like vaporware when their code is already ready for use, right now.

Amazing how this is flying under the radar. One of the big problems of "smart contracts" is the problem of oracles == basically we can set the logic of the contract (payout 1btc if x happens)- easy, but how do you know the "truth" of whether x happens. Which source do you trust and how do you know it's not gamed? 
If this works in practice (it's all theory right now, but shows promise), you've solved a huge chunk of the smart contracts problem. Would not discount this one.
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:06:58
Let’s be clear - who should focus on Bitcoin? Developers? The markets? People buying coins? 
Oh, and how do you ”enforce” that?
The code is open source. People are forgetting the nature of the game. It’s like saying “let’s all buy songs/movies legally because it’s better for the artist….etc. etc.” — but the digital reality of it is that people will copy, replicate. Why? Just because they can and the technology is there do it.  In many ways it’s like a force of nature. It’s just the way it is, for better or worse.
Altcoins can’t be stopped. In fact it will get easier and easier to do them. Do you really think there will be less altcoins in the future than today? It’ll be like running a blog or setting up a youtube channel — any kid in a garage now has the opportunity (note: NOT the guarantee) to have an audience of millions with a few clicks of a button. Whereas a few years ago you’d have to be technically proficient, and decades ago you’d need large enough capital first to run a TV station or run a printing press to have that impact. 
The protocol will be copied. It will be modified. New versions will be created. Many of it will be ridiculous and worthless — yes. But some will be brilliant. Some will build on Bitcoin, some won’t. Some will even blur the notion of alt-coin is….many interesting, experimental configurations. That’s great. There are many valid advantages NOT to build on bitcoin, just as there are many advantages to doing so.
Power laws will always exist. But so will the tails. Let’s see it all compete.

This question goes beyond bitcoin. It is ultimately a question about whether the Austrian view or the Keynsian view is correct. (Bitcoin being the manifestation of the austrian view). If you believe the austrian view - bitcoin will work. If not, it won't. Sorry that this isn't a rebuttal - I'm just saying that, forget about btc, I doubt that those rooted in the fundamental beliefs of either economic view would change their mind so easily.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:14:50
Matt, 
After covering the fundamentals (security, storage, transactions, process etc), I would highly recommend exploring the other proposed uses for the BTC network. 
Reading about these uses (colored coins, proofofexistence.com etc), was truly an eye opener for me into how deep this rabbit hole was. BTC is not just a currency - it is a paradigm shift. A red pill.
There are many proposed applications (and more to come I’m sure) but I’d like to highlight this one specifically as it was the most mind-blowing to me, not just from a technical standpoint but philosophically as well: **Autonomous and Self-owned companies** (and self-owned software, robots/self-driving cars). 
Sounds cray right? But this is not sci-fi — you are already actually taking part in the first known working prototype without realizing it: the Bitcoin network itself.
The below readings are a bit technical but I believe you will get the gist of it. The talk by Mike Hearn (Googler/BTC developer) is particularly useful and I would start there. Good luck on your trip!
