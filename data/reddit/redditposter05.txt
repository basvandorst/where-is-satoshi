There has to be a fees somewhere. Can you sell for cash there?
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:29:56
I don't know why they cared. It was only the consumer that was being hurt with fees 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:43:05
Exactly! These statements are stupid. The majority of people bought after 10k probably. Yes the majority who bought after probably still have less than people who bought before 10k but still. Of course youre going to see fallout when something you pay for decreases by 50%. Not saying that panic selling is right or even smart but just trying to show how statements like this are kind of dumb.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:59:02
I will give you this ridiculously high fees are there. But waiting for days? I set my fees at 36 blocks and was charged about $15. It took about nine hours for the transaction to go through.. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:19:01
Well I can get that. Now with idiots crying about fees that is their own fault. Id send a reply back calling them dumb asses. 
I really dont know why I was fired from my customer service job. Had a 100% resolution rate...
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:32:51
So I hate fees but at the same time I definitely want the company to be able to make money. The last thing Cryptor needs is a exchange crashing because everybody tries to withdrawal too much. Don't get me wrong I don't want to pay enormous fees but I don't mind paying a little bit here and there. Using gdax has been a godsend just because of setting limit orders.
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:28:57
I don't think the electrum uses segwit yet
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:07:22

I looked at the men pull chart when it says 80,000 what does that mean? 80000 transactions per hour per minute? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:26:52
Where is The Source on this though? It's just a log in the link
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:29:26
I ended up upping the fee to the lowest yet probable level. It estimated 25 blocks.  The transaction was confirmed in 5 minutes. 6 confirmations in about an hour. Not sure why it went so fast. Definitely wasnt 25 blocks though. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:16:55
Would you say its just smarter to replace the fee a second time and get it to go through? Is that risky doing it 2 times? So I guess 3 times altogether? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:31:55
I couldnt send this coin because Im trying to send it to a non segwit wallet. Coinbase.

I didn't even notice I told any Bitcoin. I thought it was sort of a Servicing Department. Do they have a wallet on that site? I know blockchain. Info does but I didn't know block Explorer did.

Looks like my electrum wallet will allow it just not sure if it is wise. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:57:34
That is what I use to determine if I should send anything. Right now a Fee will be like 10 to 20 bucks depending on how much gas you give it. Lowest Setting on Electrum is running about 13 bucks currently. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:14:20
But isnt litecoin based off of bitcoin blockchain? Just trying to understand what you mean by scam coin. I dont like Bkash either but mostly because of Roger Ver. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:46:36
I mean they can't change Bitcoins name. It's decentralized  including the name.. people are going to call Bitcoin well Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:23:03
Nope. Both my electrum wallet and the website I went to I copied and pasted directly from there. No typos
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:21:46
Would it be bad to increase the fee for a second time? Keep in mind its going to coinbase and their wallet system is odd. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:15:25
The site crashed even without announcing that they were not prepared at all. Supposedly they are hiring new people in the new year. And they didn't even wait till the Manpower was there.

I cant CB wont link my accounts... I cant get my bank account linked either. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:04:23
I actually panicked and moved some BTC from one wallet to another. It took 45 mins for the transaction to happen. Bitcoin isnt that slow. Coinbase wallets are slow. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:41:28
I bet you 3 satoshies 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:30:13
I do not want CBs channels frozen... I do wish theyd move to the US with their accounts but that would be awful to be completely cut off. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:37
Well point proven. 
Yes. You can pick an amount. Lets say you want to switch BCH for BTC. You hit the sell button then you hit what wallet you want it in then instead of the USD wallet you hit bitcoin and then agree to the transaction fee then BAM you have bitcoin.

Is there any speculation as to when? 30 bucks is just ridiculous of a transfer fee. Also will it be tough to change over to lightning with a wallet that was using core?

Oh god, Coinbase while incompetent isnt that bad. They could have rolled BCH out more smoothly and planned better for high traffic but they arent stealing. Its a bunch of people who didnt invest responsibly. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:02:34
It will dicrease in Value. LTC did after introduction but it also went up a huge amount as well. This thing wont stay down long as much as I hate it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:52:16
That's what I'm saying I lost money because I didn't take profit. Yeah I used the wrong terminology sue me.... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:57:51
I dont believe in CB manipulation. I do believe in their incompetence though... They werent prepared and had a poor introduction method.
Anything introduced on Cb is going to go up. That is a fact but the way they did this was just ridiculous.

 mistake. I take this back. Ill be deleting it because I dont want to spread false info. Sorry everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:56:55
Yeah but pokemon go has a smaller userbase right? CB had to have known this would happen right? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:49:48
I'm really not though. I totally believe that because bth is on coinbase it should be higher. Coinbase has virtually no competition and a very wide Market. Bitcoin cash should be at 3000 if not higher but accidentally allow trading to go to 9000 is ridiculous.. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:40:24
Interesting. Sounds risky....
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:30:51
How is that possible? According to blockchain. Info we are still at a 120k bites
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:04:42
Why would he delete if he labels everyone?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:30:07
Gdax spread is consistently higher than other sites. Hell coinbase unit price is higher than their own chart. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:16:58
Yes and yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:17:47
Seriously, Fuck them. They should make that very obvious that could happen. Ive been looking and it is in some small print but its not noticeable. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:01
 mistake. I take this back. Ill be deleting it because I dont want to spread false info. Sorry everyone. I dont want to be that guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:31:54
Ok so fee is around 20 bucks currently. Does low traffic time effect fee price? Or is it always going to be that price as long as btc is at 16500
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:00:36
I dont think it is necessarily the loss more about how the procedure happened. that being said we wanted decentralized and a tactful introduction doesnt have to happen. Cb will likely lose some business but gain it all back. They dont have to play nice with current customers. So I disagree and agree with you. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:31:47
How can use segwit on electrum? And how can you tell what a segwit address looks like?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:06:59
Let me know if you find anything about them. Im tired of CB and this may be a banking issue but either way I think I am done. CB does not make it obvious that there may be international service charges. I read their fee list pretty well and thats where it should be if they are sending money over seas... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:35
What do you mean by doing it with LTC? Did you have a lot of LTC before they they put it on CB. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:52:04
I mean if they announced it with an email there may have been people missing that as well. That being said an email and an earlier date would have had a gradual effect instead of massive slide / push. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:52:46
NO forKS? No Scams? No In fighting? It's a Hanukkah MiRacle. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:37:32
Yeah I got that. I figured out how calculate the cost. Electrum estimates 25 blocks. 10 of Gone by since I posted that and I still have no confirmations.  Meanwhile this morning I did a transaction and it took about 2 hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:31:37
Coinbase nor gdax will not properly linked my bank account.

I imagine it's like an online brokerage account. Youre buying from coin base not the market as a whole. Similar to that. 
That being said its not completely like you said as I can send crypto else where. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:50:56
Man I guess I just like to think people are incompetant over being seedy but I wouldnt put it past them. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:43:19
If they got litecoin Id be completely down. Do they have cash pairing? Also where are their bank transactions done. CB routes through UK  which charges fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:11:11
They also weren't even prepared for it. They could have waited till they had more manpower and they didn't.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:50:00
I guess 35000 merchants is No where. Why are you hating on crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:28:18
Where do you buy from? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:12:57
I have lost money. And that is fine. I have taken some original money out over the last few days. All that is fine. Even though I've lost profits that I never realized I am okay with that. I'm not okay with the fact that coinbase didn't prepare. Bitcoin cash should be at 3000 heck maybe even five thousand but coinbase lack of preparedness sending it to 8000 is just ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:28:01
Who sold it back then?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:59:19
That's why I loathe news they present opinion like fact 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:30:56
Do it on your coinbase account. You can upload photos on coinbase and it works for gdax

Wait a bit. Some will be credited 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:58:57

@_date: 2017-12-20 07:48:48
So what? Idk what you're trying to say? People aren't going to trade for another coin? 
I Def think bcash will thrive but it shouldn't be this high. Over 5k 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:13:44
Yes but they weren't even prepared. Also they could have sent out emails saying they were going to offer this instead of just spring it on people. This would have created some speculation and a gradual gain. Not one mad rush. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:08:42
So my understanding of an investment trust is that it delives an asset at some point. It dies eventually. I cant find anywhere when GBTC has a mature date and delivers the asset which would be bitcoin. Is my understanding correct here?

 mistake. I take this back. Ill be deleting it because I dont want to spread false info. Sorry everyone.

@_date: 2017-08-15 13:42:45
What rule am I breaking? Because I was asking a question that was valid to the topic y'all were talking about? You weren't talking about new people and I asked you a question about new people and what they should do. Not exactly off topic.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:47:02
Yes but how do I know what is true and what is BS, I see people writing articles about the tech then others contradicting what that article says. I see guys claiming a backslide to 3000 USD and others saying it will hit 15,000 USD. 
Idk why you are being so hostile. It only helps if more people learn about it and buy into it... By not helping you are hurting your self. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:13:04

@_date: 2017-08-15 04:32:34

@_date: 2017-08-15 04:26:43
Yeah but what do they read? It's not like there's any official text, there's no Bitcoin Bible. Also Ive seen noobs ask questions on here, I am one of them by the way and  you get ridiculed or down voted for asking questions. It's not a very helpful community all the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:38:06
And they arent transferring money out of the country? Wont charge me a fee? Money is going to another US account? 
You like Gemini? Im just so frustrated with CB. Its got a lot going for it but its just also not great at the same time. Sending litecoin and ETH of all things takes up to 45 mins sometimes... 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:42:32
I don't get it. It's a camera. 
Edit: I just noticed it's a hardrive. Thought it was a poorly wrapped box with a shipping label. And too much clear tape. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:20:03
I was just making a joke. I don't know if that's what he was making the joke about I just  picked up on the counterfeit part. I don't know if that was Op's intention which I think it is now based on your reply. I think the Bitcoin cash hate is a little bit overdone. Several Industries do stuff like this. They get as close as they legally can to someone else's product and name. And a lot of times they end up being just as popular if not more popular. Don't get me wrong I'm not a fan of Bitcoin cash mostly because of Rodger is a jerk. But fundamentally I don't think he's doing anything terribly wrong.

Thats what ive seen it called from other wallets. Import feature. You just input the private key that is on the paper wallet. Coinbase doesnt allow for importing wallets with private keys to my knowledge (which isnt very much).
