This is a useless idea. The accepted blocks already contain information for the minimum fee, having that info on header doesn't provide any advantages. The information can be relayed to the SPV wallets in any way the wallet maker pleases. The information would be derived from the fullblock or a sequence of blocks which contain much more useful information than the lowest fee in the block.

Some exchanges hard code tether to be exactly 1.0. 
But it doesn't matter either, they seem to have gotten away with printing so much of it, I hardly think the last billion dollar tether can be backed. They started printing it faster after subpoena, doesn't that look like an exit scam.

I began writing but forgot to post before I had to leave my computer.. 
Keeping some of my post here:
Block sizes dictate how many transactions you can fit in the block. Most basic transactions occupy about 220bytes. We have only 1MB space that we can stuff these in. And we can add 1 block at about every 10 minutes.
-Back to additional points:
Satoshi did put the limit but this was 7-8(?) years ago, and I think having the 1MB blocks seeing how it affected the fee market is for me becoming a ridiculous notion. At the time it prevented spam which may have disrupted nodes, but with the blocks now full of legitimate transactions competing, this is no longer an issue, especially if we just have 2 - 4 MB. There is sufficient evidence that the blockchain is insufficient to hold basic demand (not daily or coffee transactions).

-The problem is oversimplified, in an isolated system, you can force any value to a currency, but no system can be self sustaining (or maybe let's say most countries cannot self-sustain), you need to buy stuff from others, and those others do not care how much tax in Bolivars you can collect.

I know it's not a problem of Bisq, but any central exchange, you are selling to and buying from a market price instead of a specific person, so the fiat is "anonymized". So I think it's a sort of disadvantage for decentralized fiat exchange as there's nothing to do to unlink the fiat to the buyer of fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:19:11
Do you foresee a solution? Fees along with the coinbase reward concentrate the bitcoin wealth further towards certain miners -&gt; miners with a lot of hashpower is more likely to find blocks, collect even more fees and coinbase rewards, which in turn could be used to increase their hashpower. I can't think of any solution right now..
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:34:25
For various reasons:
* We don't know how fee market will evolve, even though we have RBF, we can still have legitimate tx accelerators, having legitimate deals with several miners, which may cause 0.1% of "accelerated" low fee tx's show up in a good deal of blocks, creating a positive feedback loop for their business.
* Miners may favor transactions towards / from businesses they have deals with, which may also constitute a small portion of tx's that does not reflect correct fees, and this is perfectly ethical.
* They may game the system by letting legimitate users spam the network with low fee tx's that they or others miners would not include anyway, clogging up the mempool for free. (Sometimes a string of blocks come from the same miner), all by simply adding 1 low fee tx to their blocks.
By the end of the day, the lowest fee metric may be rendered useless, but even if this is rock solid information, to better deal with the fees (have tiers with respect to how quickly you want your tx to go), the entire picture over a period of time needs to be assessed, anyway. Work that goes to enhance this part of the protocol could be spent elsewhere. Finite resources and limited ability upgrade protocol should have us looking for more impactful features.
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:22:30
Isn't this just a word-play? Yes, they are updating a ledger about who owns what, but they are actually transferring the ability to spend a certain amount of Bitcoin and this is enabled by the miners.
Btw, tangential to the subject, miners may be forced by a government to cooperate so they don't add certain tx's originating from certain addresses, effectively freezing funds there, that's why decentralization around the globe is so important!
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:49:53
With so much re-broadcasting, these tx's don't die, do they.. They should be dropped, if the wallet doesn't support rebroadcasting with higher fee one is doomed.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:55:26
The blocks will easily be filled due to induced demand but at least there should be much less congestion. I'm not worried about the fee market until the very last halvening. The difficulty adjustment perfectly takes care of the number of miners taking shot at the coin reward + fees.

I thought about that while commenting, you and I can theoretically open a channel between, and no one else, so it'd be like our private LN network. We can add Joe's hub which also complies to KYC. (An entity can also have several hubs facing special customers)
Also, even if they cannot enforce connections of other hubs, they can choose to reject payments from unknown sources. I don't think they can be accountable for routing payments because of the anonymity, they can choose to reject payments from unknown sources as the recipient.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:35:58
Not as wasteful as one might think with respect to blockchain space, doing them in one tx does not really save much extra (until Schnorr comes along) but having them separately has huge price gains because you are never in a hurry when consolidating and you can set very low fees per byte... when sending to customers you want to be quick. The low fee/byte in the original consolidation is very fair to the block space and the rest of the users, it only goes through when other time critical tx's go and when there's less activity on chain, therefore it has secondary gains by not competing with your and my transactions and not driving fees upwards.

People are more likely to play nice on the mainnet for now, I'd rather they abuse it on the test.net and produce valuable feedback, otherwise the the mainnet LN could be abused later on if it grows so much by people with ill-intentions and cause actual damage, which harms the ecosystem, which could go like the Mt.Gox of LN.
Abuse the heck out of LN on test.net, try to flood it, try coordinated dOs, bail out on channels etc etc. Do things that nice people won't do on mainnet. Don't leave it to the bad people to abuse it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:59:20
The things I say effects the lowest fee value 1:1, making the metric deceiving, but not rest of the block, so these will not effect a proper fee estimation algo which will take into account thousands of fees over time. With SPV's already having means to be relayed the estimations, this new metric, which by itself may have little use without knowing the rest of the block, is too much work to upgrade protocol headers.

Well, reading the thread is cringeworthy. We went from "why does the blockchain have to contain coffee transactions" to "Then don't transact 100 dollars using Bitcoin." They are using the slippery slope argument about what happens when we increase the block size ("how can we have 1 gigabyte blocks?!") but the slippery slope actually happened not for the block size but the fees and the amount we are able to transact.

I agree that batching is way more important, provides up to 90% reduction in space when they batch 250 outgoing transactions, and vastly reduces the utxo clutter. If they had batched, even without utxo consolidation, Coinbase wouldn't have the 3 million dollar wallet that they cannot move funds out of.

I read a bit about the Bech32 address format after your comment, can't say I fully grasped it but I think it can allow different encodings of the Bech32 format as it talks about "A segwit address[6] is a Bech32 encoding of:..." which may mean the same format can be used for Schnorr enabled addresses with a different encoding, but they would be new addresses... I'm 99% sure that new signature scheme will not be available to existing addresses, as it would require a hard fork which most don't want and also this is the bleeding edge cryptography and not everyone would want to enable this new signing scheme on their existing addresses, so a manual migration to a new Schnorr enabled address will be necessary.

The measure is not about moving funds between exchanges, it means people had to buy bitcoin first, and exchange their bitcoin with other people, bitcoin will be out of the loop, which has a negative impact on the bitcoin market. Of course you may not care about that either (which is totally understandable, you may be invested in the core principles of Bitcoin rather than simply thinking about market behavior) but at least I should clarify myself (again)

What's true, removed comment :\
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:10:32
The old nodes see the segwit addresses as "anybody can spend" addresses, it's just that there are not enough (maybe 0?) miners now that would allow them to spend those and add them as valid transactions. The "compeletely optional" part now is the part that's literally how Bitcoin network keeps the funds in Segwit addresses above "0" value, as you can imagine an "anybody can spend" address is not financially viable for people (like me) holding their money on a segwit address.
So the current valuable network is the one with Segwit enabled.

I'm sorry that you had to correct me twice on the details. I misread


1 value: the witness version
I took that 1 as the "1" in bc1 however it's just the separator. :/
Thanks for all the clarifications.
I don't want to take more of your time, so I understand if you do not reply to this one, but can a soft fork, theoretically, grant existing addresses a 0 btc amount virtual "setting" token, to be "spent" only once, for addresses to signal their willingness to support new signing schemes? This setting token would not even necessarily be visible in the utxo set, but if an address that normally would not support a specific signing scheme / feature tries that new feature, instead of refusing the transaction, the nodes could check to see if that address spent that setting token to signal their willingness to use the new feature?
This would not only prevent on chain transactions just to migrate to new features, but also enable existing addresses new features that can be made compatible (emphasis on "that can be made compatible").

You are correct that one cannot properly guess how much energy should be put into security, you can learn it the hard way after that security is broken. That said, we are concentrating all the funding to security and nothing towards scaling. Even a 1 to 100 ratio may have worked wonders, don't know...
As for the fee market, we are closer to the beginning of Bitcoin's reward era than the end of the reward era. That's some years before Bitcoin can survive. As I said, even without a fee market, the difficulty adjustment perfectly balances the hash rate required for any given market value, it's one aspect of Bitcoin that got things spot on. Market price too high? Bitcoin is a bigger target, but more miners would secure it. Market price too low for expenses? Miners would leave to find the equilibrium, but that's something we need to accept that goes with a lower market price. There's a lot of other things to worry about than the miner's fee gains for a good, good while.
Thanks for the insight.

I'd like to add, median transaction may have gone up because
1) Bitcoin's value has dramatically risen and indeed there are a lot of happy people who have invested at the start of or before 2017.
2) People cannot or do not want to move low amounts of money due to fees anymore. And it's not a good thing. A friend of mine is waiting for the prices to go down so he can send his 200 usd, he'll keep his bitcoin on an exchange. One other wants to liquidate into alts, which he will probably also keep on exchange.
High fees cause centralization towards exchanges, if you are slowly accumulating Bitcoin, I cannot even advise you to keep your money in your own wallet anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:03:38
I guess they do, better worded now, thanks...
Also good point about trustless nature of the information, but as an SPV some level of trust is required for the more important financial aspect of your currency anyway, and SPV wallets still need to do proper assessment for different tiers of fees which require knowledge of full block fees. So this header change, which requires a sort of upgrade for the network protocol, is too much work for no gains of any significance with respect to the current situation.

Market cap is pretty much useless esp. in the case for cryptocurrencies, for the reasons you mention, but it can show trading trends over time, and the more cryptocurrencies in the pool, the less a single instance of a pump effecting the percentage.

I didn't elaborate dominance, sure I know Market cap is a dubious metric, but it does show trends.
By dominance, I mean this: up until very recently, most of the world bought bitcoin first to even get into cryptocurrencies, buy bitcoin - move to an exchange, buy alt-coin, so inherently almost every cryptocurrency had strict relation with Bitcoin and it's price. To buy an altcoin, mostly a person would Bitcoin at market price, move to an exchange... So the interest in altcoins also benefited Bitcoin. Now the coin that benefits is probably Eth, three-four months ago, I didn't have a fiat pair for that in my exchange, now I have, and if I want to buy some altcoins, I just buy a little of that, instead of Bitcoin like I did just a couple of months ago.
Another result of high fees is that it is concentrating bitcoin on central exchanges for people not moving / buying big amounts of money, and that's also a bad thing. I'm keeping more of my bitcoins on exchange, I used to move anything over 500 dollars to my hardware wallet, because sending them back in case I need money was trivial.

You are correct in saying that no single entity's behavior should take down Bitcoin. However, Coinbase is channelling its user funds to spam the network, so they are socializing the cost to spam the network by distributing the cost of spam in a potentially un-ending manner because of new users. In essence, it's not a single company that does this, but its users unwittingly spamming it *through* the company.
Therefore, we need to raise awareness so those people that use company's services use it as little as possible.

A direct transfer also means you may be accidentally doing business with and tied to people with shady practices, since you can't be doing KYC/AML checks yourself this may prove problematic.

This will be something that we need to be aware of until 1btc = 1btc.

Don't think of me as someone who's only interested in price and gains, I don't even follow twitter analysis and pump schemes on twitter (which did bring good gains for a couple of friends).. I'm invested in a few coins I believe, read about, and don't actively trade any of them. But let's not pretend the market price and dominance are completely separated from Bitcoin's end-game. The more it loses its influence, the further away it is from its goals. And being the gold-reference in the crypto currency has so far been an important role of Bitcoin one should not dismiss.
I think the fees are high, and increasing the block space will greatly diminish the fees, while Segwit adoption will organically increase the block size, and LN and other 2nd layers will chime in to solve other problems. With LN and other solutions, there will be more use cases and more need for blockspace.
Right now, Bitcoin currently cannot handle the base use case, and the exorbitant fees empower miners more than it should and concentrates mining efforts, and that's not healthy in the long run. Maybe it's design flaw, inherent to Bitcoin; a non-mining node is not directly incentivized, so it has to be cheap to operate. But a contradiction arises when you have to be economically active, send / receive, yet you have to pay those fees. The cost of mining is perfectly covered through coinbase rewards in conjuction with the appropriate difficulty adjustment, let some of them leave if it's not enough. The money poured into mining is not reaped by higher throughput, but nearly all of it goes into the hashing, which has created an energy beast, some of that funds and energy could have served to increase the throughput, but Bitcoin is not designed to use that energy to scale but only secure it. This results in the most secure distributed network, but maybe we are a bit more secure than we can afford to be?

If you think it's a currency of the future without expecting to go up, you can always buy it when you have to, in future, and maybe you won't even have to buy it if you will be paid in bitcoins; after all, if it will be the currency of the future, you should be able to earn enough bitcoins to live by.
When one is currently buying bitcoin, it's due to the expectance that it will go up in the future, because of the current limited use cases. So an enormous part of Bitcoin value is dependent on the number of people that think it will in time be more valuable.

**For people with Nano Ledger using the Segwit Addresses:** When setting custom sat/byte, set the sat/byte to the sat/byte fee you want to compete with, as if you are not using Segwit; **do not apply the *Segwit discount* yourself**. Ledger sets the appropriate sat/weight for your transaction that competes with tx's at the price you set.
Ledger's bitcoin wallet also uses LIFO, meaning if you had a small recent deposit to your address, smaller than your outgoing funds, your tx will surely have at least two inputs, whether you have an utxo larger than your outgoing funds or not. The wallet emphasizes reducing UTXO clutter over smaller size transactions.
I was going to post it as its own thread but it's just a small tip so maybe some people should see it here.

Imagine a solar panel firm that sells a package for home use, bundled with a bitcoin miner (or miners) that adapts to energy usage. The only problem could be it would be cheaper to devote it all to BTC and buy the rest from grid, at times based on the difficulty levels and BTC price. If the green energy is devoted 100% to bitcoin then Bitcoin would be less effective in the Green energy transition.

Having an economically active node, sending and receiving funds is good for someone to verify without having to trust third parties, by enforcing the rules one wants to follow. If some of the miners diverge from the protocol, you make sure your funds from and to your wallet will follow the chain you want. Also, some people can act like electrum servers for SPV wallets if I'm not mistaken.
Other than that, I don't think running an economically inactive node on a raspberry pi means much at all for the health of the network. What if miners diverge from the protocol? What will your raspberry pi achieve if you are not receiving and sending from that node? I honestly need to know this.

Good number of people even on this sub are unaware of the GDAX route, let alone the common user. Batching also has nothing to do with Segwit.

If enough users did this, be sure that the free route will be no more.

You are correct that SPV's download only headers, having said that, the minimum tx fee included in the headers is on its own a very useless statistic. Miners may include a single super low fee tx for various reasons, and those reasons may not even be nefarious either. Here are my main points:
* Header info on the single lowest fee cannot provide the information of a full block can.
* Outlier fees can and will happen, meaning SPV would have to ~~download~~ take all headers into account continuously for proper estimation, just in case it doesn't hit an outlier fee, and it should have the necessary ~~high~~ low pass filters for it to provide a more dependable estimate.
* SPV wallets already have means to be relayed information about estimated fees.
* The relayed information has the potential to have estimates based on several full blocks, and thousands of transaction fees.
* This could only help SPV's that have static, built-in fees in code, and I don't know if there's any such silly wallet out there dishing out 500 sat/byte fees, but it's not up to the protocol to hand hold those, if there are any.
It's not harmful to have that info by any means, but pretty useless and development time could go elsewhere.

This is very good, but I don't see why the mind-blowing part is the speed of transactions or the low fees. I'd like to know how resilient the network is, under load, under attack, with people trying to extract vital information, trying to take down nodes etc etc. Exchanging your crypto currencies on an exchange is super fast too, that's off-chain. Or maybe your transaction being broadcast and nodes accepting your transaction is super fast too if you'd like a decentralized example. Or maybe sending your controller input on a p2p hosted online game takes 30 milliseconds to the host, and back to other players exchanging data over TCP-IP hops.
While I love that it is fast and cheap, I wouldn't expect anything less from it. That's the first thing it should be and it shouldn't be the surprising part.

Current coinbase reward is enough, if it's not enough to cover expenses, miners would leave but there would be an equilibrium after difficulty adjustments, there's no problem with that.

I agree. 2nd layers do not dictate that we should keep the block size limit at 1MB The fact that Satoshi or Hal finney predicted second layers does not imply we should be doing 1MB blocks. The outstanding amount of transactions in mempool tell us 1MB is no longer viable, 1MB blocks served their purpose. The raspberry full node fetish in this billion dollar game should go away before it's too late.
Economically inactive raspberry nodes do not make sense or is useful for the network, and economically active raspberry nodes do not makes sense either, when you may need to pay as much as the raspberry for a single transaction and the total fees for a *single* block buy you 2000 raspberries.

Keep in mind that you need to check how much they put a fee on the TX itself, not how much they charge you for withdrawal.
For exchanges that do consolidation, the withdrawal fee may include consolidation fees (hidden from user in the withdrawal TX) Bitfinex does this on deposit time, others may reflect it during withdrawal.
Consolidations are big transfers but low sat/byte, but it's safe to assume a withdrawal may cost about double the fee you see in the TX.

The better answer would be, gold did not have the competition Bitcoin has. Bitcoin can have infinite many competitors mimicking its features, and in many ways surpass it because new coins do not have problems tweaking the Bitcoin formula, but it's a very though job to update Bitcoin, because of decentralization.
So in theory, a perfect mix of scalability and decentralization can and will happen on an alternative, just not Bitcoin it seems. The best solution would be an "adaptively rigid" or "rigidly adaptive" set of rules that updates itself in deterministic fashion with verifiable input data stored on chain. 
These set of rules could determine how big the blocks should be and what the block time should be, without hurting the user base, while giving non-mining full nodes some sort of incentivization maybe through a second channel PoW lottery.
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:52:31
The first paragraph is 100% correct, but currently (until Schnorr) a strict consolidation strategy (single input) is always cheaper than using multiple inputs for your high priority (high sat/byte) transactions (e.g. customer withdrawals).
You can chuck in there a few high input amounts to consolidate them alongside batched withdrawals, but each input is roughly 4.5 times the size of an output. So for each input you pack in, you displace roughly 4/5 outputs, at the same sat/byte level, so having that input in consolidated form always pays off because you'd have consolidated for the price of 1, or at most 2 high priority outputs or maybe even less.
Also, it would have made some sense for an entity using half of the block-chain like coinbase to have invested in a bit of mining. Even if you are able to represent 0.5-1% hashing power, you'd be able to get through a block once a day or two days, use that block as an opportunity to consolidate the absolute dust, subsidized by the coinbase reward + fees from the rest. An aggressive consolidation strategy would have created a very little amount of dust, though anyway, I'm just brain storming..

I'm sure they will also not like 20-30 dollar tx fees. We have to subsidize people not being able to use full nodes, but we shouldn't subsidize mining operations further by dishing out 5btc to miners every block, all the while we have a nice difficulty ramp up / ramp down system should the block reward be too little for the difficulty. The fee market is at insane levels and the high fees will make the mining operations bigger and bigger and concentrate hashing power in more dangerous ways than it is even now.

You can't use Segwit from an old address, you need to have moved, now is the perfect time and you can set a 5 sat/byte fee and move to Segwit address. This way, you will not only have consolidated your utxo's but also be able to pay less during the congested times, a 0.5 usd fee transfer can save you 10-20 dollars during bad times, and cause less strain during the congested times as it adds to the blocksize.

You say you back it up, everybody trusts you. You then proceed to print a billion "dollars" of it out of thin air. You then keep buying BTC with your TOTHORS, hey, you've got plenty of it for free, so why not... You have therefore acquired a billion dollar worth of BTC all the while pumping the price up, or not let it fall as much. The price is pumped up in USD, mind you, since TOTHOR prices is pegged to USD.
People who have given up their BTC for TOTHOR's will be affected worst, but this has the potential to take down the entire market as the current valuation, the insane price increase, is all tied to TOTHOR's ability to buy BTC, as if TOTHOR is backed 1:1 by USD.

Oh I get your point now. But don't be surprised, they need Segwit more than ever now to consolidate their dust wallets hoping that it will lessen the fees for non-segwit tx's too, now that the S2X plan failed. If they had their way with S2X, they'd have an enormous influence and say on the Bitcoin development.

It would be awesome to have had a difficulty system that provide meaningful output that can be verified to be genuine. Would be ASIC resistant, some people ASIC resistance is good, some say it's bad. Problem would be to deduct that the meaningful result is genuine and not someone cheating and churning out random numbers, the results would not be easy to verify but maybe some genius figured it out already or some genius can, in future.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:33:57
Sure, but the more centralized mining becomes, the more power a single aspect of Bitcoin becomes influential over the future of Bitcoin. And it's unavoidable with the current system. Need more separate actors but people with the most hash power already have the power to further concentrate the hashpower due to Bitcoin' increasing value or fees.

I do have an uneasiness about the whole cryptocurrency market, with so much pump-dumps, insider tradings, cryptos gaining %500 in a matter of 4-5 days by mere announcement OF an announcement (TRON), crpytos gaining 100% with rumours of an anouncement, cyptos gaining 20-30% with rumours of an announcement of an announcement...

The fee is paid upfront from the deposit fees. Nothing is free, and they take up the block-chain space just the same.
Also, the way they eat up the cost and make it free for customers can inadvertently create block-chain bloat, because users may choose to do small transfers without having to care about the fee. So in the mid-long term, the free withdrawal adding to the bloat and increase fees, people could be less likely to move out at all in the long term, once they get out, they are hit with fees **everywhere, all the time**, so it could be a long term strategy. Or maybe they are just incompetent and haven't at all thought about the implications...
Still, they are not paying these out of their own pockets, but from the fees they've taken beforehand.
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:53:55
Of note, Schnorr will probably come with a soft fork and ~~sport a new address format~~ will require new addresses, the existing UTXO dust will not be saved directly (but indirectly through Segwit adoption + LN + Schnorr + maybe a blocksize increase) reducing the fees for legacy addresses.
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:28:29
Unfortunately true. The system needs to scale, adding Schnorr has the potentially to clear up a lot, a LOT of dust.
If I can learn btc-blockchain programming (pipe dream perhaps), when Schnorr comes I want to do a coin-join'like service that will allow wholesome dust utxo's to be sent to Segwit addresses for super cheap, by joining multiple parties utxo's (savings on the block chain would come from sending a compound signature from all parties).
For these type of activities, I'm guessing wallets need to support interactivity during the process, tough. I hope such a day comes. Such a feature could allow batched deposits/donations.
Although, as we see, anything opt-in, due to being permission-less and with bitcoin having a lot of competition, may not be adopted as fast as we'd like (instead of spending time developing the infrastructure, just switch to an alternative that they want people to trade anyway), even though the feature may have direct financial gains.

It's still wise to accomodate for a base node requirement that's not necessarily a raspberry. Tech has come a long way and bigger blocks do not out rule second layers, the inability to scale it to the rooftops while staying on chain is evident, it's just impossible at some point.
There are some ways to mitigate the block relay latency and make it easier to catch up with the rest of the chain, there's a lot of low hanging fruit that needs some work but that kind of work is now unfortunately less active.
Economically active nodes are where it's at, there's no reason to just relay the block chain with a bandwidth starving raspberry. But when you pay extremely high fees, it's a conflict, I can buy a raspberry pi with 3 transfer fees when I'm not in a hurry, and 1 when need my funds to go in predictable time. Or if I'm economically involved with bitcoin I can up the ante and get some capable machine.

Batching is bundling up separate transfers in one transaction. Here's [a recent example](
) from the wonderful folks at freebitco dot in.
They bundled 91 transfers to their customers, taking up 3148 bytes.
If they were to send them 1 by 1, even with single consolidated inputs for each, it would be at the very least ~20000 bytes (220 * 91). They batch and manage a **85% reduction in tx size,** leaving a lot of room for everybody else, and they spent a VERY respectable **~2210 satoshis PER customer** transfer.
You'll notice they used a massive 99 btc input for about a 1BTC transfer, because they input consolidate like crazy. Their business model could not be sustained without it but this is something a bitcoin faucet is able to do, but the biggest player in the business can't.

But a blocksize increase to 1.6 - 2 MB can make things much easier for the time being, while segwit adoption should organically increase the actual block size to 4-6MB, with the slow adoption it has. So I think it's a nice way to scale, scale the base limit, and Segwit adoption takes care of the organic growth...

It's more worrying then, if they are indeed spamming for free!?
The spam attack you mention can only happen when big players (less decentralized) are mining, or a group of miners collude, if everybody had similar hash power, they'd just be losing the fees.
The bad thing is, they get much more in return! Coinbase reward is pretty much enough to cover expenses and then some (Bitcoin went 10x in year but the difficulty increase * energy expenses did not go up 10x, so they don't lose much in the initial runs for spam :\)

Segwit fees are lower because instead of adding 1 non-segwit transaction, the miner can add multiple segwit transactions that totals more fees within the block.
So Segwit fees are lower because it's competing with non-segwit transactions. When all tx's are Segwit, there will be no such competition, BUT, there will also be more Tx's in the block so it may balance out.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:06:53

I thought Schnorr would be used for existing addresses but It will probably use a new address format that we need to migrate to. So we won't be able to use it to consolidate the existing utxo set.
It's totally understandable though, a totally new way of announcing the spending of your funds, and not everyone would like the idea before it's deemed fully secure, so it's more than acceptable that they won't force people to start using it, but it will be through a soft fork.

Well, this is not an edge case for them because this is what they do all the time (Actually they usually batch over 200 tx's and peak out at 250), but they themselves may be the edge case. They have a very aggressive consolidation strategy. You are correct that the 2200 satoshis per customer for that specific transaction is not the true cost, and this is reflected through their withdrawal fees, the batched withdrawal fee at the time of this transaction was at about 4000 satoshis, but it's not like they are pocketing the difference, but using this difference to consolidate. At the peak though where the least first-to-block tx's had 500 sat bytes, the withdrawal fee went all the way up to 30 000 satoshis, but they adjust very quickly, and 30 000 satoshi fees is quite an achievement during those nightmare peak times.
Their batched withdrawals, the dozens and dozens I managed to peek, always had a single input, and I'm guessing they try to achieve 2-3 blocks inclusion time once TX is announced, so the withdrawal sat/bytes are on the high side, but their consolidations where they have multiple input weigh more but have lower sat/bytes, this way, they are able to ask only double the actual withdrawal cost.
You can follow the trail and check out their consolidations, they've recently switched to segwit for withdrawals but their backend and deposits are still non-segwit, but I'm sure they are working on this too.

The blocks mentioned do not contain your typical payment style transactions, I'd say at the very least they may be consolidation related, but they mostly look like spam, just skimmed through a block using a block explorer and there are several 1000 satoshi transfers going in out.
Just check out a BCH block explorer, those that are 8MB, you'll see several structured 1000 satoshi "consolidations" into single addresses, but it's not a consolidation when that address that is consolidated ALSO sends 1000 satoshi transfers out.
Someone could be stress testing 8MB blocks to show that it works, or someone could be spamming to show 8MB blocks can be problematic.

Most people trust exchanges because of ignorance and think of them like banks.. BUT...
Current situation with fees promotes keeping your funds on exchanges.

He has a little left and he's now going to send those remaining from a wallet he controls, to the exchange, when the congestions hopefully goes away.

Argh. Schnorr should come as soon as possible.
But this is Coinbase's own stupid problem, however, a problem that has a lot of consequences on the blockchain. This is not even something that required complex engineering, just scheduled input consolidation through available wallet software.
This is what happens when you care for ultra short term profits and having no mid-term plans. I was able to do ~5 sat/byte transfers 3 times in a row maybe some 2 months ago, from a non-segwit wallet, even.

A quarter of a single 1MB block (256K) is enough to serve ~7000 withdrawals, batched in 150-160 groups. *And that's without segwit*. That's 7000 withdrawals every block, with 75% of the block still free.

Thanks for the idea, I managed to this without risking my existing funds by lending one from a friend and recovering my account there, he hadn't yet set up his and we'll make sure he also does it.
One peculiar thing, I didn't uninstall the bitcoin wallet extension. The wallet upon restoration, showed the account name correctly.

@_date: 2017-12-31 15:15:47
My ideal fantasy solution:
* A dynamic block size which takes into account past node download performance of economically active nodes within the past 50 000 blocks, in a way that no single miner can push other miners or economically active nodes out of the network. This could be very hard to do algorithmically but hey we've got clever people up in them clouds.
* Changes to the block structure to reduce miner-work start latency, using either state of the art [O1 block propagation]( or simply a tx-list header first block that contain tx identifiers at the beginning and signatures and all the rest elsewhere..
* Consensus Pruned check points so full nodes can begin working without waiting for the full block chain. Ok this one is very controversial. :)

It seems to be an automated message tagging my problem as worked on, maybe to buy the support team some time. It waited for a reply from me, and if I didn't respond, it would consider my case solved.

We can't even encourage exchanges to use Segwit and batching, and the two have immediate effects to reduce fee for the exchange and its users alike. One would think companies who have direct stake in Bitcoin would be gentle to the blockchain but they are practically shitting on the plate they are eating from. (direct conversion from a proverb in my native lang)
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:42:19
I agree with most of your points. The fees are exaggerated in my example but it's very unpredictable.
But LN reducing the current type of load to remedy congestion, is also another assumption.
I thought LN was mostly good for small payments, I can see day traders locking up funds in big channels but not many others, that said this is all speculation.
One peculiar thing I've seen in an LN video is that, the counter party does not have to match your funds in a channel if it's on the receiving end, for example, in that video the coffee shop opened a channel with 0 staked bitcoins. Is this going to be the case? If this is true, exchanges can easily open channels to ordinary users. But then don't you have to stake some to provide mutual trust??

There's no limit to how long one can HODL, but you haven't made a dime without selling your Bitcoins. 
Also, it's still possible one reserves some to buy during corrections, and sell the 20-30 percent profit, money that you can and will use and create an active and living breathing market.

They have to spam twice as much to have the same effect with a double block size, there will be spam with a 512K block, there will be spam with a 2MB block. Accept it as it is.
I'm not under-educated, I know about Segwit and the block size and weight. Do you know the amount of money paid in fees, both total, and above 200 sat/bytes, with 100-200 sat/bytes waiting for some days to clear, during the congestion? Who takes that money, miners take it all, and the miners are empowered. Effectively, the network is subsidizing "raspberry pi" nodes at great cost.

I guess posts such as these give more incentive to *sell* then HODL.
Why should I hold, if, for sure, "this will cause a panic, and the price **will** go down?"
You don't even say it "**may**" go down. You say it will. If you are sure it will go down and there will be mass panic, sell now, buy the dip, create a ~~resistance~~ support from there instead of sitting out, you may end up being more beneficial for the rebound, and you'll be increasing your bitcoins along the process, so why not sell now, if this is the case.
In the end, posts like these to me are covert FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:05:28
This is a huge problem, and this has the potential to break the whole ecosystem. I hope the next update introduces bigger blocks on top of schnorr / mast etc etc.
100 sat / byte transfers became the new 0-20 satoshi transfers, they are not getting included, and 0-20 satoshi transfers are pushed off the mempool once again. My friend paid 110 sat/byte fee to move to an exchange to buy himself a small laptop, he was keeping his money in his own wallet instead of an exchange like I advised him, I ended up helping him by exchanging my own btc, when his money shows up on the exchange, he'll transfer to me.
So currently, outside of an exchange, Bitcoin is not transferable or usable with acceptable fees. It's insane. This forces people to keep their Bitcoin's on exchanges, which is not healthy in the long run.
Bitcoin currently is censorship resistant, as long as you have the money to speak.

You may be correct but for this instance being gentle has a monetary advantage so the system should have balanced. Otherwise being gentle for altruistic reasons would not work at all. Also as a permissionless open platform completely devoid of a central moderation it has worked quite well until now but some things need to change. But given the current situation upgrades without hard forking is extremely hard. And adoption of backwards compatible softforks are not bringing the goods.
I am somewhat pessimistic for these reasons.

Also, in another thread, interestingly they are said to be [one of the worst offenders for taking up blockspace!](

I'm sorry but this Ver competing against 170 000 transactions with a median fee of 3-5 dollars along with 4000-5000 thousand added every 10 minutes is not a plausible scenario. Could it be just that Bitcoin is becoming so popular and at peak times people want to rush in to exchanges? The most favourite crypto currency with 60% dominance with a market cap of quarter trillion dollars, going all time highs and the max capacity per 10 minutes is about 4K transactions, isn't it easy to overflow this?
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:25:08
Still, they are distributed to point of sale (coincidentally PoS) and very evenly distributed. The terminals may be always on, but they take so little energy, that they also have wireless ones. This vs the amount of ASIC's that are constantly working non-stop, and the 99.9 of the hash power is discarded (for security and trust over a distributed network) every block. Imagine running ASICs on batteries.
Visa is efficient because it's centralized, but it's centralized, it does not need to provide trust on a decentralized network, and Bitcoin by nature will never be as efficient because it needs proof of work by way of discarding a lot of work to limit block generation time in a trustless way, otherwise blocks would be added after 10 mins "central server" time. But it's also why, on chain solutions for Visa like activity does not make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:35:45
The flawed part is the bottleneck for transaction capacity.
The system is not actually flawed, it has to work like that to work on a trustless way on a distributed system. The system does not directly keep track of a balance sheet, but a culmination of unspent outputs signed by the last sender, which you then sign to pass some onto some folk you want to send your money, and you send the change back to yourself.

And LN will prevent spam attack on the base chain, how? If LN begins and there's no more spam, I can come up with a few nutty conspiracy theories. But no,  I do not think spam would stop when LN comes.
Increasing the block size with the same ratio of legitimate transactions will require the spammers to more than double their spending to get the same effect. The fees also trickle upwards during congestion, and a non-congested network won't just have half the fees.
And, I think fees totalling 5 - 10 btc every block either imply spammers have endless pockets, or it is just that the most popular cryptocurrency may not be handling more than 4-5 transactions a second. A top 100 website website gets more unique views than that.

I'm novice too, so my advice will most probably ruin your finances :)
I won't bother you with details but I buy a little every month on market price and if I happen to have a bolus money, since volatility is always there, I refrain from buying at market price, I put those in scaled order 4-5 pieces between 10% - 25% below market price. That money can be left "behind" if BTC keeps going up but since there's no way I can predict it, I don't feel bad and increased my order limits. Since BTC corrects itself in a jiffy in upwards fashion after dips, I will have made ~10% anyway, only at a later date.

This way, about once everyday, such tx's are added to the chain :))

The current congestion is not caused by future usage patterns that Lightnin Network will allow us to do. Lightning Network will allow us to do something different.
Those &gt;200 sat/byte tx's that make it to the next block for hours and hours straight, with 100-200 sat/bytes waiting for several hours and days to clear, are not trying to buy coffee or do micro-transactions. So LN will add uses cases, and will probably require extra blockspace if successful, on top of what we have, and maybe offload from current use a little.

It's not a flaw for Bitcoin but a flaw of Coinbase and some other exchanges, and popular wallet software. Typical users indeed need not worry about it, as long as the tools that they interact with worry about it.
But you can also call it a flaw of Bitcoin in the sense that it allows everybody to interact with the protocol whether they are behaving responsible to the rest of the blockchain or not, and it's in a way why it has censorship resistance. Anything that adheres to the protocol is accepted as the protocol cannot determine whether a user could have batched their tx's, used segwit, avoid utxo fragmentation where possible. It's actually not the protocol's problem but as an open platform, we should be using it responsibly. What they are doing is not unlike leaving shit on a public camping place that anyone can camp, taking up much of the camping spots and let everyone fight for the rest.
It's Coinbase who needs to be respectful to the Blockspace, to use it more efficiently, as a prominent actor.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:27:28

I don't think they eat the transaction fee. They are the same company, it's probably an off-chain transaction. Basically, Coinbase allow 0 fee (or low fee?) transfers to merchants that adopt Coinbase accounts. So **Coinbase is in fact itself a *centralised* second layer solution** that not only does not care about fees, but enforces your funds to stay with them because of high fees.
Coinbase is probably perfectly fine with high fees. Their S2X support was either betting on the wrong horse or some other political agenda that I cannot fathom.

When 9 out of 10 times the sending address will not use Segwit, there's not much Shapeshift can do about it. (Coinomi and exodus are two wallet software that use Shapeshift and they do not use Segwit) It's also hard for them to implement batching. However, exchanges could use Segwit and batching, and batching has nothing to do with Segwit and provide up to 80-90% size reduction on the chain, yet they don't.

So much this. The smart contract could work with percentages instead of absolutes.
I don't think Exchanges would care or would be interested, they'd rather have those locked in, but the exchanges could also have an option to autowithdraw to specified addresses on inactivity of 1 year, maybe, of course with several warning to registered e-mail beforehand to let you postpone this if you are still alive..
Just like how they try to adhere to laws like AML and KYC, exchanges may be forced through legislation to have such options.

The surge is indeed probably caused by people rushing into exchanges and not out, I have to agree, that's also something that was at the back of my head. Still, every byte counts, every block contains very precious data space, batched transfers are the low hanging fruit. I use a bitcoin faucet that batches every 6 hours, and they are managing withdrawal fees of **14000 satoshis**, **right now**, at the peak congestion time. Will have to check how long they confirm though, but before congestion the fee was 4000 satoshis.
As for people rushing in, maybe some of these deposit congestion effects can be mitigated a tiny bit by Schnorr signatures, using a service similar to CoinJoin but targets lower fees. Of course the savings won't be like single input multioutput tx's as you need return address information for every input.

He's fine because he has to be, because Bitcoin Cash does not have Segwit and off-chain solutions could be a nightmare to implement, Bitcoin has Segwit, and we can also scale in other ways. Just because there's immense potential of LN, shouldn't mean we have to do with 1MB.
We'll have LN **but it doesn't mean we should NOT relieve the network**. You have to go to the chain twice for opening and closing channels, 30 + 30 dollar fees can hurt any LN benefits. And 1 year later, it may be 100 + 100 dollars. I'll be competing with 100+ sat/byte transactions. I'd rather use my Visa, thank you, but then why do we have LN at all.
We need bigger blocks anyway, and there's no reason we should be going on with a limit put 8 years ago. 8 years if eon time for technology.
If LN and other 2nd layer solutions will solve the scaling, this means we won't have to go 100MB blocks. But a 1MB limit that's in place for 8 years is becoming silly now.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:55:52
Actually there's one I know, and I use. It's a bitcoin faucet with daily interest (small but hey) and betting options, not giving its name here, but they are currently managing 3800 satoshi withdrawal fees and a minimum 30000 withdrawal amount and that's without Segwit. Their *minimum* withdrawal amount is a fraction of BTC withdrawal **fees** I've seen in some exchanges.
Here's one latest example, you'll see in this one they send out to 165 people (probably 1 back to their hotwallet)
They do seem to keep the satoshi / byte a bit high but still manage a 4000 satoshi fee per output. It'd be great if they supported segwit but I'm sure they would like to. They batch once every 6 hours. I'm betting Coinbase has orders of magnitude more withdrawals.
During the big congestion where people were attaching 30 dollar fees, they managed a 16000-18000 satoshi fee rate. Since your account also act as a bitcoin wallet there, you can send to any address over there. I'm not going to advertise the name but I have great respect for these guys.

The idea is, you could hold that gold forever until you die, if you don't sell your gold, it has no effect on your life, so you aren't actually using the riches provided by it (other than maybe peace of mind that you can use it someday when you need it, but bitcoin has the added adrenaline factor which may negate even that :) ).
My friend has told me a story about a villager man, who was super "rich" because he happened to have bought a share of a factory that became central to country's steel production. He was still wearing worn out clothes, and I kid you not, his wife was complaining about him not buying a washing machine. In this extreme example, can you say he was rich?
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:37:30

Agreed, and I'll add, lightning **is not going to help the current situation**, at all. Lightning does not change everything, it ADDS something to Bitcoin.
The current situation is caused by people flooding to exchanges, not by people rushing to buy BigMac meals or Mochaccino. It will not help solve 95% of the current situation.
Schnorr sigs may help by allowing exchanges to setup incoming tx batches by some sort of not-yet existing service, I need to read up on it but I guess it can allow bundling of incoming tx's from separate parties, and condense their signatures into a single signature.
By the end of the day, Lightning Network is not designed to handle the current situation. It will ADD a very good functionality, but let's not get carried away. We need bigger blocks and hopefully it will be added alongside of meaningful additions like Schnorr.

ZebPay, an exchange in India, who has to prioritize low fees has a very nice blog piece about how they reduced their fees. They do price tiering so the bigger withdrawals slightly subsidizes the small ones (and big withdrawals typically require more input anyway) and they do batching, on top of Segwit:

I'd like to point out that BTCTurk, an exchange commanding about a third of the exchange volume in Turkey, is now using Segwit addresses. They also do small amount of batching, probably enough to cover for their fixed 50000 sat withdrawal fees. (I think they do like 4-5 outputs.)
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:16:50
But how many fruits are there for this use case, in the current situation, like asks. It may be used by Exchanges, but I highly doubt the congestion is due to withdrawals, in this case, LN will help in a subset of tx's, and it will open up an additional avenue, not solve the current problem, just like it will add an additionaly avenue for micro and even nano transactions, but not solve the *current* problem.
Also, if the problem is withdrawal from central entitities, like exchanges, of bitcoin, at ATH's, then it's nice to know that you can fit 30 000 tx's batched in 150 groups in a single block:
There you'll see about 150 outputs costing only less that 6Kb for the blockchain...
...*Which means, even if only 1 in 5 tx's are such transactions, using this mitigation method already available, every 5 blocks, 30 000 txo's could be moved into the chain.*
Yet, just the other day [when I wanted to talk about it, nobody was even remotely interested](

Yeah but, maybe, you can sell 3000 usd worth of coins and be totally on the safe side if it goes to 0, you can still ride it and have your fun, you still will be invested in something you believe in.
I think at that level of gain, there's no harm in securing your initial investment! Prevents all sorts of "I told you so"s, at the expense of 10% loss of future gains, but you'll also be allowing some other soul to enjoy those gains hopefully in future.

The adoption percentage does not matter in view of having the ability to use LN, LN requires a malleability fix and the current LN implementation requires Segwit on BTC. Having said that, if Bch has no malleability issue, it could theoretically be able to use LN, but I assume it would need a lot of work to do so. Even from a decentralized atomic swap exchange stand point, LN is worth having.

People who invest in Bitcoin and want to give back help the infrastructure may want to upgrade gears. Someone who cannot afford a decent 3 year old computer with median internet bandwidth capacity will not also be able to afford 10 dollar fees, let alone the fees we're seeing during the congestion.
During the congestion, every block now contains 5-6 BTC in fees. About every 10 minutes, enough fees are given to buy 1500 raspberry pi's. There's no way to channel those funds to nodes of course, but isn't that some kind of irony?
So the tx's are essentially "subsidizing" slow and incapable nodes at incredible rates, in a way that empowers only a single side of the equation.

Of course you can say that. But the market can say, why wait mid-term, when I get the store of value aspect AND the ability spend it without having to care about fees, right now? The fees are also against the core values of Bitcoin, banking the unbanked with 10 dollar per tx fee, heck, even 5 dollar per tx is outrageous, and I'm not even talking about congested times.
As a store of value, that value is strictly derived from market perception of what its value should be or even what people think it will in the following years. Surely, Bitcoin beats Gold by an incredible margin in many regards, even with the current fees. But it's not as if Gold had serious competition from other precious metals. But Bitcoin has a lot of competition, competition that stores value, but also moves the value around much more practically.
Bitcoin's first mover advantage can only last for so long, due to how easy it is to switch to the competition, it's much more practical to switch to another cryptocurrency than to move your gold to another country and get some platinum from that country and move it back.

They'd need to have some sort of escrow service which locks up funds until everything is green, which would cause a double tx fee though.

Thanks a lot for this information.
I was thinking of a service that may be used for donations or exchanges for depositing, which would batch incoming transfers, and therefore could potentially save a lot of blockspace with Schnorr, seems like the wallets themselves need to support this -&gt; Initiate a batched outgoing transfer, once the receiving party signals for "take-off", sign.
It could be used to consolidate and cheapen deposits / donations, a direct positive impact on the sender, by reducing the signature size but it would also reduce utxo fragmentation on the receiving end so there'd be much less need to further consolidate those in a separate tx, having a direct impact on the blockchain strain and fees that the exchange have to endure and pass to its customers.. (For example, Bitfinex started to take a low-deposit fee for this reason, send them funds under 1000 usd worth, and they take a hefty some on BTC and somewhat less but considerable amount on other cryptocurrencies.)

It's true that I'd rather live a poor man's life with a 10000btc stash than to live a poor man's life without.
But I wouldn't mind putting up a 1000btc sell walls multiple times along the way if I had it, either. Wouldn't regret spending it in a way to make my life much more cosy, as I already said, there's no limit to HODL'ing, and when people say "they will regret it in a few years" I can't support that view, especially for someone who at least has 1000btc, and who knows how much more. Why regret changing your BTC to 99% of the population won't earn in their lifetime?
After a certain threshold, there's not much reason in accumulating more money, unless you are Elon Musk and want to reach Mars. Some people are content with reaching their own moon.

A continuous inflow over capacity creates a backlog that acts like a stampede. Have an average influx of 8 tx's per second on a chain that can handle 6 will result in a transaction stampede, driving fees to insane levels. Making that 12 will fix that entirely. Stampedes can and will occur during times, but it'll be cleared much faster.
If doubling capacity will buy us only one month, you can forget about LN saving the chain. It will be much more beneficial than you think.

Bitcoin cannot handle the adoption in its current state, unfortunately.
A steady growth with less fluctuations would draw many more people over time than a very volatile bitcoin with less people shouting bubble, current growth rate is not sustainable with the infrastructure Bitcoin has, and it may trigger a collapse, the money goes away as fast as it came in.
A slower and steadier growth also attracts more people that do cost averaging who regularly buy Bitcoin, instead of people who are getting loans because of FOMO.

I don't think miners are worried about a congested network, and that they are so sad that they are scooping up 30 dollar transaction fees. Congestion immediately drives up fees, a bigger block is more expensive to spam. Competing Tx's over 50 sat/byte fees means the congestion is caused by newly added genuine tx's (read: not spam).

That's really nice to hear. My concern is most current popular SPV wallets have not even began to support Segwit, I wonder how they would support LN. The wallet you linked to seems to be very easy to use.
I imagined wallets would have a "savings" portion and a "daily spending" portion to have some amount that is actually staked on the LN (as much as the LN nodes you open channels to allowed). I will try the wallet you linked as soon as possible. There definitely needs to be some sort of auto-discovery of LN nodes when time comes, and maybe routing through multiple nodes for a single tx when the tx exceeds average node staked amount should be possible too.

For that number to have a hint of stability, there needs to be 10x buyers willing to spend 10x more money compared to now.

To be frank, the other coins built upon knowledge acquired by Bitcoin development, and being much more centralized they can roll out updates easier at the beginning of their life span. I guess it was easier to update protocol at the start of Bitcoin's inception than it's now, with a handful of nodes to update. Currently, the biggest problem is to update protocol without a fork, so you get every part of the equation to go along with you, miners + nodes + community support for the update.

To put in 20 dollars on a channel, you may need up to 10-20-30usd to open a channel depending on the congestion. Then there's the closing fee.
Even if it's 5 dollars, you'll be paying 10 dollars + coffee price, and we have much cheaper options for that.

Add Bitcoin Cash, he'd have it at fork. Also maybe add Bitcoin Gold :)
As much as people hate Bitcoin Cash, one could have made bank with perfect timing, dump Bitcoin cash for 700usd for BTC, buy quadruple amount of BCH at 300usd with the BTC you got from BCH (as BTC has also gone up to more than double), redump at 1600-2000.

And, when opening a channel.
I hope when closing a channel, the write-back to the blockchain will not end up being a massive problem. e.g., you open a channel in a non-congested time.. When you need to close the channel, if you happen to have to write back in a congested time, if you don't put a high enough fee, how will the LN resulting balance be written back, and how will it affect any contracts that are fulfilled but left in a state that can't be written back to the blockchain?

How will the economy match the paradigm of a deflationary currency? Currently, the economy relies on people's spending in increasing rates, production of things not just needs but wants in increasing fashion. And I believe this is a lot less sustainable for the world than Bitcoin's energy requirements.
Bitcoin in its current form rewards holding, and indirectly punishes spending. The extreme HODL'ers even reduce their wants, and just focus on their needs, just to save more Bitcoin for the future. As bad as this may seem for an economy which requires spending and spending even more, I think the HODL mentality may be good for mother nature. Don't know the total effects when 1Bitcoin will be 1Bitcoin.

I'm hopeful, as I said. But since exchanges have 90-95% cold wallet operations, I'm assuming even if you hold 2-3 in 100 new customer money locked up, it should make it somewhat easier for them..

There's not a fast way to do it and I wish S2X wasn't a thing and Core would handle the transition to a larger blocks, and everybody would back them, instead of us having to deal with incompetent dev(s) to make that change.
As for the Segwit, maybe making it optional was not the best idea. They went to great lengths to make Segwit a soft-fork just so that a couple of old nodes would not reject the new transactions, I must admit through very clever wizardry but Segwit has 99% miner support and nodes should have been updated by now too.

Well, the part that I fail to understand is, Bitcoin will have LN, that's super awesome, but how would a LN be beneficial with 1MB blocks, when opening and closing channel will cost and arm and a leg? With LN adding use cases, hence increasing people actually using and spending of Bitcoin, will relieve the network? Or will it increase the traffic even more, as people will begin to open and close channels, on top of the normal usage we have now?
LN means we won't need 100MB blocks. It doesn't mean we do not need 2MB blocks, and maybe 4MB further down the road.

How much throughput increase is expected with Segwit? I'm optimistic about Schnorr for a lot of use cases (like grouped deposits towards exchanges) but I'd like to know the throughput increase vs. blockspace taken for Segwit.)
Btw segwit discount is temporary until all tx's are segwit, but I think there'll always be a portion of non segwit tx's that my segwit tx will be preferred over..

A bitcoin faucet I use had, until the last congestion, a free option that they batch sent on Sunday's. Unfortunately they now ask for 3000 satoshis but it's pretty darned good for a bitcoin tx. They still have not adopted Segwit, but they batch like crazy and constantly do utxo consolidation. They have a 6 hour batched withdrawal option which costed 3000 satoshis, it went as high as 30 000 currently with the ongoing congestion, and is fluctuating.

I do not say LN is not worth implementing. However, the assumption that the current spike is due to people withdrawing Bitcoin is a problem that can **already** be mitigated by TX batching, which saves Blockchain space by 90% or more, by allowing one to send 10x or more transactions using the same space. I highly doubt though, that the congestion is due to Bitcoin withdrawals, mostly.
We need numbers and statistics but intuition says, this is people trying to send their Bitcoin's TO the exchanges, not from. It's more speculative to think that the current spike is because a person is willing to withdraw Bitcoin, and send it to *another* exchange, *using* bitcoin, at the time when 30 dollar fees do not guarantee inclusion within the next blocks, at a time of even higher volatility, and when people are in a hurry I guess to buy some kind of altcoin on some other exchange that the exchange they are does *not* support.
Most people began using ETH or Litecoin to get out of exchanges to **another exchange**, it's much faster, and 100+ times cheaper to move, they have much shorter block times to boot, allowing people to quickly move their funds when speed is important (e.g. for arbitrage)
So, to think that LN will mitigate the current spike, even by 10-20%, is wishful thinking, and, on top of it, a Bitcoin withdrawal spike from central entities can already be dealt with 10x space savings through batching.

I'd be fine with a 50% increase in 4 months which is massive compared to standard investment tools and much above inflation, and I think nobody would be complaining. I just wanted to protect my savings against inflation and then maybe gain a little, but I'm taken by surprise. Bitcoin is a beast.

Lightning Network is Opt-in, and it's use case is for small transactions and it will have to be deployed with a block-size increase (for a log more tx's in Lightning, I can easily see double the number of tx's on the base chain). Segwit is Opt-in, and you see the adoption rate, and that scares me.
That said, we need to use the blockchain more efficiently and making it bigger postpones that motivation, and I don't know how Crypto can get out of this mess. Bitcoin goes down, the whole thing goes down.

25% is huge..
You can create a congestion with constant 10% over capacity. In just 10 blocks, you'll have a backlog that's double the capacity, keep it for another 10 rounds, it's triple, and it balloons. A 25% capacity increase would meet the demand and be able to clear 15% of tx's extra, thereby removing the congestion.

In my case, yes, I had the impression that I could withdraw 0.025 btc after a 24 hour period, a number which was later removed completely the next day.
Screw me, but four glaring issues for their verification system:
* The basic information is submitted without user reviewing the entered data, hit enter, and the information is submitted. My postal code was truncated.
* The system does not let you edit the basic information submitted, the one they base all further verification data.
* When auto enhanced verification system fails, it does not let you re-try, maybe depending on where you are from.
* It does not let you retry although the support is overwhelmed. People managing their own verification would greatly reduce the strain on support.
Additional note: My friend had been verified in minutes on Bittrex, but he had not deposited beforehand, like any sane person should. His smooth verification in a time of my own hurry, and the fact that I thought 0.025 / day  withdrawal was possible in any case, lead me to my mistake of depositing before getting verified. The damned gold fork went for 330 (call it greed but I had already dumped some for a third of that price) on Bittrex while it was 110usd in HitBTC, and I thought, the price would immediately tank due to arbitrage possibilities, so I kinda hurried to get rid of that.
Edit: JUST retested using a temp email to make sure that indeed, the basic information is submitted as soon as user presses enter.. No review, no are you sure this will lock up your funds if you entered it wrong. No possibility to go back and edit. They do have a warning now on the verification page, about not letting withdrawals. They don't have this warning on the deposit page though.

I'm with you that most tx's do not need to be on the main chain, but we should also be realistic with the block size limit being to little for the current use patterns, and I doubt the current use patterns encompass people trying to do micro-transactions.
There can be ways of mitigating the block size causing stress on smaller nodes and smaller pools even with bigger block sizes. [Here's one that my feeble mind has come up with]( it may not be feasible but I just like to brain storm :)
[Here's another something to reduce working blockchain size]( This may be rambling of a fool, but I wonder what those bright minds would come up with if they focused on both ends of the scaling spectrum.

They also need to add a single input, multi output super low fee slow withdrawal method, where they batch the outgoing transactions.. This would cut down their share in the blockchain by about 40%, if not more!
I'm yet to be corrected on this, but for every withdrawal, they do 1:1 tx's, don't they?
Edit: Slow, as in withdrawals wait for batching, not slow because of low fee, they could price the fees to be included right in the next block. That said, I don't think the batching wait would be more than half an hour given their volume.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:48:32
Poor planning, caring about immediate profits as opposed to having even a mid-term plan, not channelling engineering towards scaling their own business with the tested and working tools in hand, instead backing forks that would get them out of this mess they've created.
[Coinbase has a 3.2 million dollar wallet that now it cannot move funds out of]( because the whole wallet consists of utxo's averaging $2.2. This is simply because they did not do utxo consolidation, remember that this is not a time sensitive operation and they could have done this on the cheap.
A bitcoin faucet I use used to be able to offer me, up until last week, a free bitcoin withdrawal option once a week because they do utxo consolidation and batch like crazy. It's now unfortunately 3000 satoshis to withdraw now like that because of the immense fees.

Well, maybe we should be honest about what we want with Bitcoin, do we want it to be a store of value, with little say in daily transactions, high fees are therefore should be OK because we are not supposed to "use it". Or do we want to use it and we then want LN to come and enable us to do so, then I guess we think the fees are NOT ok and we don't think of Bitcoin strictly as a store of value.
One cannot say current situation is fine because "store of value", and then say LN is going to make it better, but I think some of us do have that doublethink. I want bitcoin to be both, and fees are not fine. I only recommend Bitcoin for HODLing now, to my friends, and advise them to buy something else for mobility (buying alts from within wallets, moving in and out of exchanges) But even this reduces Bitcoin's usage. Bitcoin has been the market entry for years but now more people are able to buy other coins directly from fiat.

Off-chain solutions should almost always be possible for any crypto-currency, for example, [this is a current off-chain scaling solution for Bitcoin]( however, a decentralized and trustless off-chain solution would be true to Bitcoin's spirit. The ability to send BTC to Coinbase accounts from within coinbase is also an offchain solution (I haven't used Coinbase but I'm guessing this is how it works).

I'm talking about the result of small blocks and a congested network, not the cause, and I'm not blaming miners, but the current situation ends up with miners getting rewarded for no extra work without any benefit to the node infrastructure. Btw, the fees do not just double during a "Transaction stampede" on congested network, it pushes the fee to go upwards in increasing fashion.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:53:22
I'm in favor of 2MB blocks but I came to the conclusion during the latest discussion that if we had it even earlier, exchanges and wallet software would continue the shit show of 0 tx optimization even further (No output batching, no segwit).. [Actually output batching has incredible blockspace wins.]( And you can couple those wins along with Segwit.
This is the absolute low hanging fruit that the majority of blockspace occupiers don't seem to employ, along with Segwit.
So it's a kind of dilemma. Unlike quite a big percent of people here, I think high fees and inability to transfer funds within predictable timeframe without spending 50 dollars has the potential to kill Bitcoin, by pushing people to alternatives. If we leave it as it is, we are leaving Bitcoin's fate to these entities which are showing little interest in using Blockchain space efficiently, services that can switch to alternatives any time they like. But if we fix the current problem by increasing capacity, we also postpone or even kill the motive to use the existing blockchain efficiently. And that is as bad in the long run as high fees right now. So it's kind of a "stick with shit at both ends" situation, a direct translation of a proverb in my native language.

I also find it apalling that people are not even discussing some current mitigation methods to lessen the load on the blockchain, without even having to increase the block size, using existing methods:
This is a thread I made, and look at the single reply, and the downvote. Never change.

No, core had nothing to with them to not implement batching, or even scheduled input consolidation. If you take the time to think that a free bitcoin faucet can offer 0 fee withdrawals without even Segwit, it's because they did their homework. Coinbase digged themselves into this and are begging for bigger blocks. (I support bigger blocks but not because we need to save Coinbase's back).
Lack of batching whatsoever created themselves a fine grain wallet that they never even consolidated, using existing wallet software. (Use all funds -&gt; send to address), and this is not Core's problem to solve. Batching would require some programming on their side and it's not rocket science, but every once in a while, consolidating your inputs during calm times, is something an ordinary user can plan.

How many coffees do you need to buy before you make back that 30 channel opening + 30 channel opening dollars, while locking up your funds in? I'd still use my CC if that's going to be case.
For LN to work its wonders, opening and closing channels need to be definitely predictable, and much cheaper than what it is now, it requires, dare I say, a non-congested base chain. The base chain is clogged up with the current use patterns, and any savings by Segwit and Schnorr will easily be eaten up by the additional log and maybe several log increases of use in the LN network while opening and closing channels.

Well, I'm not looking at the market cap but the number of transactions, currently it seems they are handling 1 million of them vs Bitcoin's about half a million. Market cap is an evaluation reflected by the latest trade value.
But of course even if we look at the market cap, continuous full blocks can easily trickle the fees upwards in domino fashion.. So yeah, if ETH becomes 4 times as popular, the fees would not necessarily be 4 times, but maybe even 16 times!

You can fork and come up with a new versioning scheme, GUI implementations can be changed by anyone including yourself, as long as you adhere to the network's protocol. You can fork from Bitcoin Core client, and add meme's to the background and display your fees in BTC per Megabyte instead of sat/KB. If your meme's are good enough, chances are some other people can download and run your version of Bitcoin node.
Since nobody has a right to tell existing miners or wallet users what version of Bitcoin Wallet / Mining software to use, upgrading the protocol (e.g. Block size increase) is a monumental undertaking. Say if you increased block size (which I support, along with several improvements that can be made to the propagation of the blocks and reducing latency for miner work start), a good number of people may not like this. Even if there's 10-15% of nodes (mining and non-mining) who does not like this change, you have essentially forked Bitcoin.
So nobody indeed owns Bitcoin, including Core.

The question is, does every node.. EVERY node, need to remember that you bought a beer, I mean that specific transaction? First of all, there's pruning to save on the storage. But still, why just work in prune mode, when you can have a snapshot? Why can we not have something like a distributed archive, a torrent file, of the full blockchain? Pools could have the full blockchain, they're getting them fees anyway. Let's make it easier on the nodes.
At any given time, no node would need to contain the entire blockchain, but the snapshot, maybe done every 20 000 blocks, and the 20 000 blocks on top the snapshot. The snapshotting, by merging the previous snapshot with the raw blocks, could be done as per protocol. Is this a crazy idea?

If they were truly malicious, they could have erased my balance there. So I have some hope. So far I think they are using funds like mine to keep liquidity. 3 weeks, 0 support aside from automated responses.
I exchanged, tried to withdraw, it told me to wait for 24 hours because I was unverified, it gave the impression that they would allow you to withdraw with a "0.025" btc limit, which was seen on their page, as it was "non verified accounts are allowed between 0 and 0.025 btc withdrawals based on date". Since it asked me to wait for 24 hours, I thought I would be allowed the next day. Nope, and the 0.025 limit was removed on their page the NEXT day, and this had 0 warning the previous day! So people who were able to withdraw in small amounts were locked in there also, with no warning.

That requires trust for every member within the party so one of them does not try to "write" to the base chain with a bad / previous balance, no?

There are promising solutions in the works for it where wallets only needing to keep track of their own utxo set:
I hope though, people agree on utxo commitment to the chain so initial block download problem will be a thing of the past. But for what I believe to be very theoretical and maybe even philosophical reasons, people do not want a download of the UTXO set as they say making it trustless is not possible. That being said, I do not agree with this point of view, bright minds may mitigate this and there may be a certain trade-off that's much more beneficial: running a fully validating node on an ordinary phone) and services may help you to know whether you are on the economically accepted chain or not.
The linked tech allows you to have a fully validating node on the phone, which could be kickstarted from a node that you own which had done the IBL. However with UTXO commitment to the chain (requires hardfork), the same tech could also be used to kick start a node in a trust"less" manner.

Wouldn't increasing precision require a network wide consensus? The new addresses would not be able to send to the old ones without creating rounding errors (could be mitigated by rounding down and always sending the extra change to a precision-native adress)  and the old ones would not be able to view exchanges between new high-precision addresses properly (errors would add up, and would IMHO not be mitigated)
@_date: 2019-03-22 13:21:37
Without confirmations, they can rob the atm machines, so a tx towards an atm machine requires those confirmations.
I think what they need to do is, when withdrawing fiat from depositing BTC, the atm machine could print out a QR code specific to the person, where the person could track the confirmations and take fiat using that QR code on any machine of that operator (probably the same one after half an hour when there's confirmation), thereby mitigating the 0-conf risk.

I hope I'm not way off here:
You are correct about needing to hold the extra proofs for your own utxo set. However, it should not be possible to recreate an utxo set from the accumulator. Just verify that the proof is valid and the utxo is in the set used to create the merkle tree. What I understand is, you are capable of updating the entire proof yourself simply by evaluating the new blocks and proofs provided to you, but until 100% of the network starts using this, you have to ask the bridge nodes for the missing proofs for the utxo's contained in the block.
You would not be able to recreate the utxo set from that data. However, bridge nodes will have both the entire utxo set and every proof for that set which you can confirm the validity of on your own. When more and more people use this system, you announce your own proofs along with the signed utxo's to the network without requiring a bridge node so when they see the new block coming in and see your utxo's, they don't even have to ask the bridge node, they can verify by checking the proof you give them.
I must say I have not understood the part for optimizing the Initial Block Download though, in a trustless way.  
About utxo commitment, ignoring even this technique, for example an utxo set a 10 000 blocks deep should be good enough to consider it rock solid way to start working with bitcoin. If I can let go of my house after 50 confirmations, I might as well trust a 10 000 block deep utxo set that I could use to kickstart my pruned node. I don't see any problems with it. And this helps a lot about scaling and the block-size debate. (300 KB blocks so IBD doesn't get out of hand? Way to screw BTC IMHO, why do we not strive to lessen its impact trustlessly, no matter how big the blocks are?)  


@_date: 2019-03-27 06:50:51
Hard fork is not required because utxo verification is not something that the blockchain needs to contain as a specific type of information, it's just that you need to make sure you don't let already spent utxo's in previous blocks into another block, how you prevent that is not in the interest of the protocol, just that it needs to be done. The obvious and most straightforward method is of course having the entire set in mem, in their full form. The not so obvious way covered in the video is to apply a editable (add/remove) merkle tree like structure to the utxo set. Quite brilliant!
The hard-fork I mention is about UTXO commitment to the chain, this technique lays out a framework  that can be used for that for a trust-less manner with which we could jump-start pruned nodes by downloading that information instead of IBL. And people oppose this but I don't support this view at all. It's not even up for debate for some people, IBL needs to be absolutely done - technically what you start with may not even be Bitcoin if you are duped, from what I understand of the main concerns. But there can be mitigation strategies for this, and having millions of phones work as full nodes is much more beneficial for the network - with the trust mitigation strategies.

Trustless as in, you have the power to fix any wrongdoing counter-party action (deliberate or software fault), so if any of the user mis-behaves, this means all the others would have to write back to chain. By trust I mean no adversarial action requiring you to counteract (channel closure). By the end of the day, you'd have more up to date channel balance so you wouldn't need to trust anybody indeed for the correct balance.

This is god damn good news. Sender sent pesos, receiver received euros. But Bitcoin was transferred as the benchmark currency. How do you not see that this is a massive progress? How do you think Bitcoin will be dominant in the future? Do we have a set date and afterwards we all stop using fiat? If Bitcoin is going to dominate, if at all, it will be transitionary phase, sorry to burst your bubble but you won't put the heads of banksters on sticks on 15 May 2026 and force the world to use bitcoin on 16 May 2026.
"Peer to peer" does not say anything about who the peer is. One or two of the peers could be banks. Two banks agreed to use Bitcoin, and they did not use any intermediary payment transfer systems \(e.g. Swift\).

There are about gazillion exchanges, which create low liquidity spots with shallow order books, which also does not help. That's to be expected for a decentralized asset. You cannot buy Apple stock from a Bangladesh exchange. Of course low trade volume exchanges affect the "global" price less, but you can imagine how big the order books would be if we joined the order books of Binance / Bitfinex / Gdax / Insert Largest Korean Exchange. (Because bad news have much more immediate effect ( a sell off ) than positive news, a shallow order book may be worse for the price)

But doesn't that create a downwards cascade? Say, if on an exchange, a buy wall is broken and price is down 5%, those who were able to buy at 3-5% advantage can sell to buyers on the other exchange until BTC is 3-5% down there too, whereas a joint orderbook would only create maybe a 1-2% drop, for the same amount of BTC bought?

Well, if you are storing channel states on a third party, you are trusting that they do not broadcast those at any given time. So LN by design requires redundancy by the first party itself. Running own LN node is way too complicated for ordinary users and will probably stay that way - this is by design, so 99% of projected users will use custodian wallets, and will have to do so with small amounts if they are being cautious - which would increase the need for on-chain tx's to replenish the amounts every so often.

I thought it indirectly did, if your outgoing transaction cannot be covered by a single utxo, you need to merge the utxo's and you'll have more inputs, with same number of outputs. The more inputs, the bigger your transaction message size, and at a fixed satoshi/byte you set, the transaction cost may be higher. Correct me if I'm wrong.

The main argument I've come across is moot. They should fix the initial sync using other means instead of strangling the chain. There are ways to make initial sync a non-issue without suffocating the chain, but I'm not sure there's enough work towards that direction.Anyway, there's no way there would be consensus on that so I'm not worried about it other than the fact that they are not going to be able to solve the initial sync due to trying to fix the wrong problem.

There's a caveat though: only thing that matters is how many inputs are required. The more inputs, the bigger the transaction space in the block, and the higher fee one has to designate. So a bigger value transaction is more likely to have more utxo's, yet a single 100 million dollar worth transfer can cost less than a 100 dollar transfer consisting of dust utxo's if the former is consolidated to a single utxo. I remember that due to bad management of Coinbase wallets, it had a wallet consisting entirely of dust utxo's worth millions and they couldn't move it during congestion, effectively locking the funds in it.

I understand direct connections are not necessary and there will be hops, so the coffee houses would be connected to a mid-size hub maybe they host themselves, which may be connected to a bigger hub, and I only need to be connected to be that big hub or some smaller hub connected to the big hub.
Yet, I wonder how this will be communicated to the users of bitcoin. How will this be handled in the UI of wallets. Since this is a mass adoption measure, the users should be able to easily stake their coins. Wallets may need to have a "spend" portion and "saving account" portion, the spend portion being entirely staked in LN, but the staked size should be dynamic, no block chain action necessary to increase / decrease stakes if there's peer to peer agreement.
With all these in mind, and the fact that Bitcoin currently is not being used for daily spending yet for the 95% of its users, and that the blocks are already full *anyway*, I don't think LN will be able to relieve the block chain at all with the current block size limit. It may help with the daily spending. I'm eager to see what it will bring, and whether centralization occurs within the 2nd layer and how it will effect the ecosystem.

I understand the endgame is Bitcoin being the reference, I was more talking about "forever" because "forever" does not make sense.
Also you can't ask everybody to HODL. If Bitcoin will become the reference currency, it will have to be so by people doing things with it. HODL'ers should be glad people are buying and selling BTC. That 10.000 BTC pizza made BTC what it is today and what it will be in the future. If everybody did the extreme HODLing (maybe with only miners selling their BTC) bitcoin would never be able to become a reference currency.  
So BTC needs HODLERS, traders, business owners and all sorts of people, but everybody cannot HODL at the same time. HODLers need not look down on people who use BTC, because people who interact with BTC is helping HODLers somewhat brave but selfish accumulation, and giving it a value.

@_date: 2019-02-05 07:43:57
With the utxo list you have access to the total of utxo's in one neat package at a known point in time, whereas with addresses you need to be able to view the balance at a specific point - the balance would need to be declared separately by the exchange which needs to align with the balance at that point time. The UTXO list makes a precise view at a precise time.
Having said this, without schnorr, this tool would only be useful -as stated in the article- for trusted auditors - otherwise one can broadcast the good tx's still the same, without the "poison" input. So in its current state without Schnorr, this method is not useful for use with ordinary users.

While it's true Bitcoin Cash has low fees and will continue to do so until for a good while even if we project a 20-30 fold increase in usage compared to now, currently it's only churning out less than 300KB worth of blocks. So it's being under utilized, technically you can use it with 0 or close to 0 fees as the blocks are not full, but even if they kept the 1MB limit, the fees would be the same, for now.

I know funds can still be replay attacked with those differences, but if they had used different channels for transaction broadcast, splitting coins would have been as easy as sending your forked coin to an address you own, since the other network wouldn't pick that up, the coins would be immediately split, with noone to replay that transaction. That's what I meant. I may be wrong though, but that's how I think it would work.

The thing is you can't have partial fungibility. Turns out, BTC is not fungible the way it is, and it may never be.

Obvious to me, if everybody applied extreme HODLism, things wouldn't work. Imagine every single person HODLing, including the miners, Bitcoin would have no value.
If nobody HODL'd and started selling at the first downhill trend, Bitcoin would go down to 0.
So we need HODL'ers and we need people who sell. This means there has to be a healthy mix of day traders, hodlers, panic sellers, ATH buyers for Bitcoin to work.
And also, my HODLing is not fanatically not spending Bitcoin, but not selling your coins for a different long term investment. We have people finding it wrong about one guy paying his über with bitcoin, and that's extremism (how much could it be..). Those types of transactions will be things that solidify the acceptance of Bitcoin.

Why can't you make it smaller?

But let me tell you something, 2MB won't be empty by then, because they won't, the 2nd layer needs to be settled on the block chain still. The second layer needs to handle an order of magnitude chain saving transactions, I don't think it's possible but we'll see.

Good points.
Coinbase helps Bitcoin, by acquiring real bitcoins, which the users can choose to transfer to their own wallets, making Bitcoin scarcer for everybody else, and increasing the market cap ever so slightly.
Trading inside exchanges is still possible without actually "owning" the bitcoin, without even moving on the blockchain you can switch between 10 cryptocurrencies in 10 minutes. This seems like a different way of trading.
I just read an article on "why you should never short a stock" and it made good sense to me, shorting a stock as I read there, has no upperbound loss limit, but owning a stock and having it down to 0, you can only lose as much as you own, so owning the stock seems to be the better option, as there's no upperbound of profit.
I wonder how shorting Bitcoin will work :) I guess they'll have to choose between whether it will rise to double or quadruple, and work it from there.

Well, I oversimplified, maybe out of my own ignorance I guess. With s2x, your broadcast is valid for both networks because if that wasn't the case, splitting coins could be as easy as sending one coin to an address you own, and sending the other coin to another address you own, unless some troll is actively replaying. Even if s2x didn't have replay protection, but used a different channel, one would have been able to split coins much easier by self-sending once on either network. Now that same methodology is based on luck (the hash rate difference may make it easier though, by setting low fees it could be ignored on the network with less hash rate)
If S2X had replay protection, using the same channels would not constitute a problem, that it has none, AND because it uses the same channels for transaction, creates a big problem. That's what I meant, otherwise using the same channels that with the same broadcast type would not be problematic.

I'm assuming, it was maybe 20 dollars.
If he paid in USD, he'd have 20 less dollars to buy bitcoin this month anyway. I don't think he spent ALL his bitcoins. He spent maybe 20 dollars worth bitcoins... which he can replace in due time.
Why are you guys so against actual use of Bitcoin? Just because his 20 dollars might become 2 bazillion dollars 10 years from now, doesn't mean he should not spend his money, NOW. One can replace 20 dollars worth of bitcoin with the click of a mouse. It's not like the old times, where you'd have to mine Bitcoin.

Kudos to the exchanges that distributed the forks as is and in timely manner, and not did whatever they are pleased with. In this case, Bitmex saved quite a lot of its customers from dumping the forked coin too early and too cheap, but it could have been a different story.
Having said that, at a time of fork if you keep your coins on exchanges, you are giving them permission to do whatever they like to do, as this is a gray area not governed by any laws. An exchange surely doesn't have to open an exchange platform for the forked coin but I believe the best approach that's been taken is giving your customers the ability to get the forked coin in the original form.

Well, not being able to move the coins dampened the potential panic dump. But I guess it hurt the Bitcoin image in the long run, people not being able to exchange through shapeshift, or even send to an exchange.
Even I now, a ledger nano s user, didn't send the latest batch of BTC to my ledger, it's waiting on the exchange.
We are more vulnerable to the same type of event, but this time people may be waiting on the exchanges. The next incident may not end up well IMHO.

I've completed reading the guide and it's very informative, thanks.
My issue with LN is, I dont think it solves a lot of the use cases, without forming mega hubs, and those mega-hubs need a heck lot of bitcoins to put stakes in the channels.
We've got full blocks already, and that's without Bitcoin's use for buying coffee and micro-transactions, people aren't doing daily spending using Bitcoin. If this day, LN began working, how much burden would be offloaded to the LN? Is there a kind of projection for this?
Most use cases for money transfer involves asymmetry, funds moving to a single direction (I buy a computer from a merchant, I send them money, they send me a computer, obviously the computer can't be sent through the Bitcoin network) A company pays its workers in Bitcoin. Most uses of daily transactions are asymmetric.
To buy my coffee, will I need to stake my bitcoins in the LN, keep much more than a coffee's worth, and keep that channel open for days, to settle at the end of the month? Will there be a coffee hub, which the coffee shops are connected to, that channels my coffee money?

I have similar sentiments. When the secondary chains are in place, and if for some reason, they make the on-chain Tx's so scarcer, we can go back to 1MB if this is so important. But Bitcoin's adoption will dictate a block size increase no matter what, as a log increase that can be achieved through secondary layers, will be settled on the block chain, and I can't imagine another log increase not filling up even a 2MB block! Just up it now, work on the secondary layers still, and this will be a great move to protect against the competition.
But you and I know it's not gonna happen.

The lack of BCH transactions increase can be because of people not moving their BTC, and mostly people that have BTC on exchanges could be converting. Notice the market share of BTC, dipped below 50% for a short while, it was up at 58%
Shapeshift BTC exchange currently is not working due to outstanding transactions on BTC, so I personally could not convert my BTC on my Exodus wallet to BCH.
Since people may not be eager to move their BCH back to their own wallets, this may lower the amount of BCH transactions.
Having said that, some people are standing to make a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:11:04
No, you can't double spend the same coin, but you can be forced to spend the forked coin when you are trying to spend your bitcoin, and vice versa. When you broadcast a transaction, both networks are able to pick it up, work it from there.
This puts not only bitcoin users at risk (for accidentally spending their forked coin) but also people who will want to use the forked coin (their bitcoin's would be at risk.)
Even if you do not care about one of the coins, if one has value above 0, why would you want to give that away for free? So this is disrespectful by the S2X devs in that regard, assuming the other coin will have 0 value (both from a No2X  and a pro-S2X perspective.)

Bitcoin cash was a clean fork, it got its own messy start with little wallet support and some exchanges are late but this is not even comparable to the s2x fork. Anybody and everybody can change the rules of the game and fork their coin if they want, as long as it doesn't masquerade its own transactions as the incumbent protocol, like s2x does with its lack of replay protection.

**Just realized, 10 000 USD already happened for me**! I'm spending too much time on CoinMarketCap and forgot to calculate my local rate, but in Turkey, where I live, it Bitcoin has long past the 10K mark!!!
At the time of writing, 1 BTC is 42626 liras, which amounts to **10906** USD!
Turkey daily exchange size recently has been about 2400 btc, steadily rising, two main exchanges. The exchange I linked has 1/3 of the total exchange size and is the one I use.
Turkey has somewhat a market of its own that usually hovers slightly above the world market, normally 200-300 usd above world rates, but this is one of the biggest gaps I've seen, &gt;1000 usd gap between the world and Turkey market, smashing the 10000k "barrier" :)
Edit: Actually, our "10K" has been 40 000 liras, which was the psychological barrier so far, tried breaking it a couple of times but smashed it after a few tries.
If you look at the minimum rate in the last 24 hours, it stayed above 10K for a day.

Otherwise I acknowledge the nice rebuttals the interviewer did, like mentioning another coin with longer chain and asking whether that could be Bitcoin, and correcting him that longest chain with most accumulated difficulty is for the nodes to continue with the "correct" chain, within the confines of the existing protocol.

It's possible that the person / vendor you are trying to send can, if the other network haven't picked your transaction already for processing, re-broadcast it so they also get the bitcoins. And why shouldn't they? If they don't split it themselves, somebody they send those coins can, if the coin transaction does not include distinct utxo's from the split network, which is rejected by the other network (This is actually a way to properly split the coins)
But there are ways to prevent it, it's called coin splitting. Some exchanges will do that for you, some software wallets like Electrum will make it somewhat easy, some hardware wallets will receive a firmware with a new app specifically to split the coins (should be easy to use hopefully), but the end result is you have to be proactive.

Coinbase lagging the fork coin does not give me confidence. It's not rocket science to distribute the forked coin IF you are backing your bitcoins 1:1, at the time of the fork. The fact that they announced instant 2x support for a fork that has no replay protection and thus is somewhat trickier to support, the way they treated Bcash holdings is not acceptable IMHO, several exchanges with much smaller volume and possibly much smaller number of developers started distributing Bcash to their users, in their original form.
I hope what Bitmex does not become the norm, as forks such as these otherwise could keep exchanges on their toes with 1:1 backing. When you delay as long as you want, god knows what they have done initially with the forked coins. They can release at the exact time that the rates do them favours, or not release at all.

I read somewhere, Coinbase doesn't even do merged / batched (single input, multiple output) transfers, is this true? That'd be a great withdrawal fee saver.
I use a bitcoin faucet that also does betting, and they do batches every 6 hours, it was 8000 satoshi (non segwit) to withdraw from them because they batch around 250 transfers into a single transaction. 60-70 BTC every 6 hours btw (probably they are sending back and forth for their hotwallet, but a hell lot of 30000 satoshi transfers are there, the minimum withdrawal.) This not only vastly reduces the load on the block chain, it reduces the fees. (Now it's about 16000 satoshis after the congestion though, it's dynamic)

This is true. It's a free market, and as long as there are full blocks, there's no reason for transaction fees to go down, if this becomes the norm, you'll be competing with high fee transactions, and would be left out of the block if you keep a low fee.

The 0 balance idea is good, but some people may be too kind to tell you there's no money in it after checking, or some people may be trusting enough to not check it and just keep it although they are interested in it, but not enough to be suspicious and check the balance, so you may have to back that up with "please check the balance, in case I screwed up something"

You can send Bitcoins to someone else's address, simply by virtue of a hacked website displaying the hacker's address, happened in a number of ICO's.
You can also send to the wrong address if you have some sort of malicious browser extension rewriting addresses, or some malware that replaces the bitcoin address in the clipboard. So Cryptocurrencies require extreme caution.

If the transaction is not tagged as RBF, a 0 confirmation for coffee is a safe bet. I don't know why but RBF allows replacing the transaction to a different address, and I have 0 idea why they allowed this, a replace by fee to the same address is acceptable (although you do reveal that you are willing and able to increase your fee to the miners), but I don't get why RBF had to allow sending to a different address.

It was my bank which let me borrow that money for me to start using their CC, the money was lent inside of my credit card limit, they had sent me the card but I hadn't been using it, so I borrowed from the bank (just something like 500 dollars) because it sort of made sense, I was to buy 100 dollars worth of Bitcoin for the every month for the next few months anyway, so why not buy now, I said, so I kinda jumped on the opportunity.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:22:59
:D Exactly. Though RBF makes it trivial to replace the TX to an own address, but like many mentioned here, CC payments can be revoked, one can pay with counterfeit 5 usd money, or leave without paying; there has to be some level trust when dealing with this, a smart contract is not needed.
I can imagine a sensor in the buccal area detecting colombian coffee at a specific degree signalling the blockchain before resolving the contract, for a more trustless exchange.

Those words allow direct access to my private keys, I can program my own wallet and have access to my funds, by following the BIP standard. I can re-create those private keys, through those words, on a Trezor. I can access to them on other wallet software.
If you like, you can see what those private keys are, by typing them on a BIP44 key generation tool. You are in total control.
You can make up those words yourself, from the standard 2048 word list, enter those on a ledger, and let ledger work on that address.
This is not even semantics. If you are hell bent on seeing what your private key is for a specific address for a specific coin, you can. Your hardware wallet does not obscure that information. It gives you and encourages you to keep that information that will allow you to re-generate your private keys. I don't know why I have to type this to someone who understands "clearly" I don't know how hardware wallets work.

The drop to 0 is a long way away and if Bitcoin is hopefully still alive until then, hyperbitcoinization would have happened, you'd have multiple parties mining themselves just to be able to have a say in the security of Bitcoin, even if we don't account for the massively increased on-chain activity even with multiple layers. The block size obviously should be a limited resource but it doesn't make sense to have 50 dollar fees so people can run the chain on 50 dollar hardware: Very high fees will cause social centralization of Bitcoin, only for the rich, those who can afford to pay for top gear anyway, so there's definitely a paradox here.

The difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin is too strict, it takes too long to adjust. With more competitors fighting for hash power, couldn't the number of blocks be reduced somehow?
This is a very delicate setting, a wrong setting may make mining switches a shitshow, but the current difficulty adjustments only works because Bitcoin is king. I hope a middleground is found between being strict and too relaxed (like bitcoin cash's EDA, which will be removed)
In your hypothetical scenario, if one cpu is left, that 1 cpu will not be able to find a block in 10 000 years, let alone find enough blocks until the difficulty adustment.

The main attack surface of Sha-256 or other digest algos is finding collisions, hence passing different things to be digested to the same hash as the original, for example this would allow an attacker to trick a different bitcoin history, hence making PoW useless.

Utreexo could be used to jumpstart nodes. An accumulator state could be proven to be connected to the accumulator "genesis" by bridge nodes, through on chain commitment. Also the utreexo talk by its author mentions some IBD mitigation by throwing in a large buffer so less data is downloaded by omitting utxo's that live and die within that buffer, I guess that wouldn't even need the accumulator state commitment.

During times where btc block subsidy is nearing 0 but not 0, BTC value would have to be higher to compensate. If it's not that high, but the fees are rampant, enough in percentage to make up for the very diminished subsidy to keep at least the current level of security, people would not use BTC, then BTC may fail. But if it's that high, it will mean hyperbitcoinization has happened anyway, then if *that* has happened, I'm willing to bet BTC will be secured (a.k.a mined) by institutions that's dependent on BTC, who would continue to mine BTC even when the subsidy is 0.

That's a good point, hopefully the combination of market value and difficulty adjustments would be able to take care of that, not just the fees. Mining operations really need to factor that in in expanding their operations if they are not doing it now. I was mainly addressing the decentralization of node activity though. Right before going 0, the block reward would already be very small in Bitcoin rewards.

At one point in the last mega congestion (during pop-champagne times) there were blocks each of which contained fees enough to buy 2000 raspberry pi's, this so that the the chain would work on raspberry pi's. Btw, I'm not against the chain working on raspberry pi's, I'd like to be able to run a full node even on my phone.
I think block size increase with Initial Block Download mitigation and UTXO commitments will make the base chain much more useful, both for rasberry pi's and even phones, which could work as full nodes. These mitigations and changes will also make block size less of a thing to worry about.

Yes, indeed. It's never black and white, and there's no clear cut solution other than solving the initial sync problem.

"The user experience is far worse with crypto"- This is indeed the case quite a few times. In the -although- unlikely event that the exchange got hacked during the transfer and the guy lost all the house money he had, we'd be telling him to not put money on exchanges and put only in crypto the amount they were willing to lose, and not your keys not your money etc etc. There's a lot of people having problems wiring the fiat money to an exchange, and the exchange screws up the transaction either going to and from fiat.
If someone comes here and says "I wired 20 000 dollars to the exchange but the exchange did not receive it and is not responsive," we have a lot of guys giving hindsight advice to not go into crypto like that (as 20 000 dollars is a lot of money for most here including myself)

If this latest downtrend is somewhat related to faketoshi's claims (or simply the impact is increased by it), it's because Roger and Jihan didn't oust him because having "satoshi" by their side was beneficial for them. He was nurtured in the BCH community and this is what we're getting. This is what happens when you have a "head figure" doing damage by claiming "BTC is broken, segwit is broken beyond repair, I'll show in 2019 etc. etc."
If this trend is due to or exacerbated by one guy, then let it be, BTC shouldn't be worth shit anyway if that's the case.

It works differently in different countries and banks.
Believe it or not, one of my cc pays me money, and I discarded any cc that took subscription fee. All of them have credit awards so I can use them to buy stuff although it accumulates slowly.
Having said ALL this, the only thing they are doing is giving some back from the money THEY make, by having deals with the merchants. To begin with, depending on the deal merchants have with the bank, they may add additional fees when buying with CC. If not, they may not be able to provide discount when buying with cash, so the penalty is incurred hidden from customer. They may have to wait to get the whole money, or maybe lose 5-10% of it if they need the money before the waiting period.
So I think it's safe to say the CC's have hidden and non-hidden fees, some handled by the customer and some by the merchants and Bitcoin could remove those fees.

The update process was very tedious for me. Lots of unable to install  errors(due to space), and I deleted a few apps like it's told in how-to, until it just said "unable to install, contact if this persists". Made sure I uninstalled *everything*, just in case it's still due to space. I got a couple of more unable to uninstall errors along the way. Hoping this is not caused by bad flash mem or something..
Still got the unable to install error 6-7 times, this was just the initial phase. After I managed past it, phew.. The second phase where it says update on the device itself... I got stuck there, unable to install. Disconnected / reconnected and tried at least 5 times.
I'm hoping the unit is not faulty, especially the memory. That said, the logs do talk about a web-socket closed error at the end. Hopefully this is just because Ledger servers may be hammered and not because there's a read / write error on the flash causing this.
Anyway, it's finally done, re-installing apps.

Some exchanges restrict the numbers after the decimal point to create a tidy order book, otherwise bots begin fighting over single satoshi increments to get ahead. This makes the raw orderbook unreadable (not really important though as the orders can be quantized for display) and puts stress on the servers due to constant re-placed orders (bad for everybody).
Restricting the decimal places results in bigger left-overs from division. However, all this could still be avoided by having a separate virtual precision for the wallet funds / order amounts.

Oh that I can get behind without feeling too awful about my own IQ.
I said in its "current state" because Bitcoin does not seem to be immune to Government intervention \*with respect to its market price\*,  to me, in its current state. Since it's decentralized anyone can open a market and the order books are thinner as a result in each of them as opposed having all buyers and all sellers at a certain point, meaning you can start a sell-off on a couple of big markets and this will be replicated across the board either through arbitrage bots or shared sentiment. At least that's how I think these 4-5% Bart patterns are possible.
If U.S. would see Bitcoin as threat, it could ban its use in the legal domain, which would, again in this current mood, tank the price, IMHO. This would not change the fundamentals about Bitcoin's inherent qualities, but it would be a set-back for the adoption and usage. Having said that, if other countries are smart, they would stop using Swift, and use something that is borderless, trustless, permissionless. I wonder what that could be! Yet this has to be a sudden and swift move by a strong coalition of many countries because we all know what happened to countries that wanted to trade their oil for euros.I'm open to learning about where I got it so wrong though.

Sat / weight is higher for segwit (compared to same number of input / output legacy transactions) so miners prefer their inclusion but sat / byte from an address starting with 3 may even be slightly lower compared to a similar legacy transaction, because non-native Segwit Addresses adds a few bytes to the tx size. Segwit tx's does not necessarily create fewer byte tx's but the weight is lower, so they have higher sat / weight value. When 100% of the transactions are Segwit, this type of Segwit advantage will not mean much but the block size will be bigger packing more Tx's so it should balance somewhat.

I hope there can be a hybrid that prevents miner centralization, along with non mining node incentives. But that's changing the formula too much. PoW of Bitcoin ended up with mining centralization because of the speculative prices enabling the miners to increase their hash power disproportionately. When you begin to find more blocks, it's a positive feedback if you make use of the proceeds to increase the hash power.
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:56:38
This doesn't mean duplicate work, it just means the nonce in those parts are not searched by the dominant implementation. For example I can have an implementation that never checks nonces below 2 000 000 000, but it only means I exhaust the nonce space faster, but I can deal with that by modifying the extranonce or maybe changing the tx order or whatever that would cause even a single bit change - every nonce I check from then on has equal chance of satisfying the difficulty, yet no nonce I find would be below 2 000 000 000, and if my implementation becomes dominant, there will be a very big gap below 2 000 000 000.
Miners are given work from pools such that they would never be searching for the same solution space, btw.

Also, is there a distributed DNS service (to reach the "classic" web?) In Turkey, all service providers employ DNS spoofing by redirecting ANY known DNS server IP to their own backbone. They don't even bother to redirect to "this website is blocked by court" page like it used to, it just can't find websites that are blocked, no matter what DNS you use, and they figure out new DNS's and add them to their re-direct list. Example of a blocked site: imgur ! Yes, imgur is banned in Turkey.

Decreasing would be suicide. BTC barely keeps up with its current use case.
The initial sync taking too long is just because we are fixated on downloading the whole chain to start the business. Maybe starting on a checkpoint could be enough for those, a consensus pruned checkpoint 10 000 blocks deep for those who can't download the whole initial chain.

This is just an engineering problem, and not really that complex. For any given block, the utxo set is deterministic, you then put the downloaded blocks on top and create that actual, working set. If pruning works, this is even easier. It just requires attention from developers, and the solution provides a download set similar to space requirements of a pruned node, only at a previous time. Every 10.000 blocks, a new pruned set could be created. At block 515.000, the pruned set at block 500 000 would be served. At block 520001, pruned block set at 510000 could be served, and the integrity of the pruned set could be imbued into the blocks.

I think BTC will keep on being the best and safest bet. On average, none of my alts performed better than BTC (within the 2 months rather short time I held them, but.. ) and times when a new crypto gaining 1000x value will be fewer and further between and it's like a 2-3 year long lottery.

Exactly, not having 2FA in the root (gmail) almost nullifies 2FA's protection value, if the root chain is weak, no point in having 2FA, if your 2FA can be tampered using similar tactics as hacking the user on the target website, even better as this leads to compromises on gazillion websites who send password reminders to the service. 
I haven't used Bittrex but this leads me to believe that the OP enabled 2FA mainly to unlock withdraw limits and security was an afterthought.
This also shows that Google NEEDS to force users for 2FA on the google account itself, if the users intends to use Google's 2FA on a target site; the users may have a false sense of security, which makes them even worse prey for scoundrels!

Ok, why couldn't coinbase stuff their customers LN channel? Users would declare their own channel, agreeing to the terms and conditions that the hub is theirs, and they assume the LN channel is their user's, they know their customers.
Why wouldn't coinbase allow me to add funds to my channel, otherwise I'd withdraw to my bitcoin wallet (that I declared to be mine, on Coinbase) and then put money on my channel from my own wallet? Not allowing this due to some law has no benefit to what the law aims. Actually, allowing this would benefit the government as it de-anonymizes the LN nodes to some extent.

Bitfinex had earlier announced this functionality some time ago without specifying fork events. I think it needs a somewhat complicated infrastructure, different from the existing trade pairs.

This is not a clarification, this is outright back-pedalling and saying something completely different.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:32:56
Cheaper than nodes that can process 2-4 MB blocks?
What has got to give, then? From what I understand, it offloads several transactions into the 2nd layer, the 2nd layer does its thing as long as the payment channel is open, and the true block chain only contains the final output. But,
* How do we trust what goes inside the 2nd layer?
* If we can trust what goes inside the 2nd layer, if it's that much trustable and the mechanism inside of that layer is fully tamper free, why don't we just ditch this whole block chain and use that 2nd layer, and keep on using the consensus of the 2nd layer? Doesn't this make the block chain useless?
* If this lightning network has the power to allow orders of magnitude of transfers, this has to be set in stone somewhere on the block chain, so the block chain should be able to handle the resulting balances of that many actions and the ledger should contain the resulting balances of all those actions anyway, how is this part of the equation solved?
So won't this make the block chain just a summary of things that happen inside the lightning network? Can we call this the bitcoin block chain anymore?
Also, in my limited understanding of bitcoin and the lightning network, lightning network does not seem to cover a lot of the use cases. For example, if I'm a business paying 1000 employees using bitcoin, would the LN help at all? It seems to open a channel between two parties, and allow continuous payments but how does this help when I'm buying Coffee at one place, comic book in another, book at another? Will I have a channel open to some sort of Escrow that concludes the payments to all these separate entities who also keep their channels open to this service?
As for the dynamic block size portion of your comment:
As for the miners doing half full blocks and not filling the blocks using the outstanding transactions, there could be ways for the nodes to reject such blocks and miner output. As for spamming, there's nothing that stops any miners from doing so right now, but now you have to deal with it inside of a single MB.
I think I kind of understand your concern, miners could inflate the outstanding transactions to trick the announced block size to the maximum and that's a problem to be solved, and to differentiate these from honest transactions could be impossible. But then, the more I think about a second layer on top of bitcoin, the more I tend to shy away from a non-block chain solution to the scaling problem, especially when storage is getting so much cheaper and the average internet speed can sufficiently handle much larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:35:42
Don't call me names before you even understand what I'm saying. "Will not break the bank" means nodes capable of working with 2MB blocks won't be too costly. Most existing nodes should handle that without problems. As for the lightning network, we are talking about machines that do thousands of transactions per second, what do you think the requirements could be compared to a full node that's supposed download 2MB and verify 5000 transactions every 10 minutes?
I'm not even talking specifically about segwit2x here and you probably  think I'm doing a pissing contest between nodes rejecting 2MB blocks and miners producing them. Anyway, I'm disappointed in your lack of courtesy.

What a sad story. I started acquiring Bitcoins 2-3 months ago, my friends actually forced me into it after nagging me for months to handle it for them. (Stupid me, I was too afraid to get in at the start of the year, I could have made enough money to close my mortgage.), so I handled all of our money myself, including buying altcoins, moving funds between exchanges. I managed satoshi accuracy with a google spreadsheet that automatically distributed the fees and the exchanged coins for joint transactions. 
But the possibility of losing their money was a nightmare, if anything happened, I'd be the one to blame, even if they'd doubt me for a second this would be very damaging for me. We split finally for one of them and it was a great relief, but I still hold for one of them. Finally I got a Nano ledger S so I'm really comfortable.
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:31:24
Watching this video 100% convinced me bigger blocks is not the answer to the orders of magnitude scaling problem. But do we need orders of magnitude scaling for Bitcoin? Why do people oppose a block size increase that makes sense with respect to median internet speeds and cheap storage space?
Does bitcoin need orders of magnitude scaling? Why can't it go with on chain scaling that does not have to be orders of magnitude bigger to support its value as the store of value, and let others (e.g. IOTA) do the daily transaction / micro - nano payment thing? Obviously, 1MB is not sufficient even for that job when I look at the amount of unconfirmed transactions, so 1MB block seems more like pushing the 2nd layer agenda.
Bitcoin does not have to be the digital gold and a casual value exchange method at the same time. And for that reason alone, we should be open to on chain scaling that makes sense to keep it the way it is. *1MB is not enough* whether we'll have lightning network or not, the current demand is not due to people rushing to buy coffee or bubble gum using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:41:20






Yes, this is the key difference. When you enter a ponzi scheme, your money is used up, up the chain. Try telling your uplink to pay back your 1000 dollars in your ponzi scheme. The only way for you to see a dime of it back is to have someone link beneath you, and the amount of people you need to find to recover your initial investment differs between schemes.
With bitcoin, you get in using your 1000 dollars, you get out whenever you want, be it 900 usd or 1100 dollars. Your money doesn't trickle up the chain to Satoshi.

Now that you said it, I checked amongst the top 10 coins Monero / Bitconnect did well against Bitcoin (stable upwards trend), and a couple of others depending on when you managed to buy, due to their own volatility.

I feel much safer, but I cannot predict the consequences of the S2X fork, with competent users being able to split coins but lots of people still will be doing non-replay protected transactions.

More valuable bitcoin for a small period of time increases "efficiency" per unit value which attracts more miners which then increases the difficulty which then balances the "inefficiency" back. So I'm saying the same thing. Although I'm talking about efficiency per unit value and not per unit transferred (so block size does not directly affect those stats)
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:04:20
I expected better than "You are talking shit", and things like "not true" "This is utter bullshit" do not qualify as information. Any basic information like (I'm making all the following up):
*1 MB block size increase will cripple 30 percent of the existing nodes because ....
* Lightning network will not cause centralization because the requirements for it is similar to those of the existing nodes [link]
would have greatly aided not only me but those others who are confused.
I'm going to take the time here to summarize how  I think a full Bitcoin node works, and please do correct me where I got this wrong:
* It's able to control your own wallet, so you have full control over which protocol you want to follow.
* It serves light wallets that connect to it.
* It has the entire valid block chain.
* It adds the new blocks broadcast by miners who acquire the right to add the block, who stuff in transactions they prefer. 
* Before it adds the new block to its own chain, it validates the block with respect to the Bitcoin protocol it's compiled to, along with the signatures of the transactions contained in the block, so the miners cannot cheat out of the protocol that the node adheres to.
* That said, the block that does not get validated on a particular set of nodes, can be validated on other set of nodes, which adds those blocks to their own chain. The network is now split, two chains exist.
* Light wallets follow the rules of the node they connect to. 
* I don't know how this part works: If miners keep on broadcasting different protocol blocks masquerading as the original protocol from the same channel Nodes keep track of, will the nodes keep on having to download the entire block until it finds a valid block, or do they have mechanisms to early-reject obvious protocol mismatched blocks to reduce their load.

But how can they state a specific block for people to gather their BTC gold, if this block is in the past? They had stated a block in future and said it would be snapshot at that time, they'll premine for a week or so and realease to public, but I don't think they can point us to a previously snapshot block then what was announced.

Also don't go into altcoins with more than 10% of your BTC. Choose three or four that could sky rocket in your own view, an altcoin that solves a problem that Bitcoin cannot, something that you like the sound of. But not more than 10%. This is my view of course.

Since Bitfinex seems to be very clear cut on supporting both chains separately and properly, is it wise for light wallet users to move to Bitfinex during the fork to receive early gains dumping the weak chain?

Are there any plans to ensure the safety and verification of the addresses (It's a tough job for a distributed network)
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:11:31
I'm not sure really. I used Coinomi wallet. (Sharing the wallet with Exodus). Coinomi has 4 fee options: Low priority (currently: ~18000 satoshi), Normal (~25000 satoshi),  Priority (~30600 satoshi) AND Default (This is decided by you).
I went in and made that default 0.0000000 BTC, but coinomi adds a minimum fee no matter what. Just 3-4 days ago, I did a similar amount transaction, and the minimum fee was 5000 satoshi, sent, **success**.
Recently there was a patch and the patch notes said they lowered the minimum fee. Downloaded, tried again, set default fee to 0.000000 and it set the fee to 1000 satoshi only. Sent **two** &lt;10usd transactions and **both went through under 90 mins, with success.**
If you are not in a hurry, &lt;5000 satoshi fee is currently doable without problems (as evidenced by 3 tx's, and the last 2 tx's with 1000 satoshi fee was in the midst of the upwards trend where you would expect some competing transactions.)

I've been exchanging on crypto currencies for two months and the only thing that bit me in the ass were the altcoins. Agreed.
That said, I'm expecting a major correction (BTC going down and alts going up) this time, after the fork, as currently the upward trend is driven by people expecting to double their bitcoins on the fork. But this time the fork won't be as clean, as there's no replay protection and it may damage Bitcoin beyond recognition. People are expecting a clean fork like the Bitcoin cash but they are wrong unfortunately.

Miner centralization is a big problem then. Maybe we can lend our cpu cycles to a non NYA mining pool but a single ASIC offsets thousands of cpus. Suddenly I like Bitcoin Gold's ASIC resistance.
Also, "they won't shoot themselves in the foot" "none of them wants to lose money because they have stake in Bitcoin" are not arguments that bring me relief at all. If Bitcoin has to rely on any single party not wanting to shoot themselves in the foot, it may as well die out because at one point it may be attacked by an entity that does not care for its existence, an entity that may not only have nothing to lose from the demise of Bitcoin, but gain from it.

Now that you ask it, short answer:
I was an idiot.
Long answer: We were buying altcoins, 10 dollars this 50 dollars that with close to 0 research. My friend asked me to buy a whopping 4.5 bch for some reason, of all the small amounts for altcoins, he was probably expecting a surge back to 1000 usd using the brief historical data and because it had the bitcoin name in it, I was handling all their transactions. I accidentally entered 6.5. Took a screenshot to let him approve the exchange rate and the amount, he said "but I wanted 4.5" . I then thought this was the call of nature and told him that I was going to buy 2. That was BCH
We bought BCH, using BITCOINS. That's how idiots we were. (actually no altcoin performed better than bitcoin since we went in, apart from OmiseGo which we bought using BCH while trying to ditch it, it went high and performed better than Bitcoin and brought us some smiles, but now it's about the same price)

For any given block, a set of spendable outputs are known, which can be serialized and shared. Otherwise, how can you verify new blocks at all? How can pruning work? It's deterministic.

But unit being irrelevant is a hard concept to grab for anyone. For example, the single digit effect on used car prices, a 19000 mile car will have significantly higher price than a 20000 mile car, the car prices have sudden jumps at the end of every 10000 miles. This is bizzare for a couple of reasons, if you used KM, the price jumps would be more frequent. If we all used a 12 based number system, the price jumps would be less frequent.
So units and number values have important psychological aspects. That's why we have more threads like "Finally reached 1 bitcoin" "Proud owner of 1 btc", and not "I've just got to 1.2 bitcoin, hoooray".

It's not really dumb though, you can buy the alts on the exchanges too.

1MB blocks are not enough for the current demand. A 2MB block, or even a 4MB block does not mean an end to innovation. It's just a basic measure against the current situation. Just because it doesn't provide orders of magnitude scaling, shouldn't mean we should oppose them.
1MB cannot meet the current demand, and people are not using it to do daily transactions, if I understood the video, it's like 5tx's a month on average. And 2nd layer solutions does not answer to these type of transactions, so we need larger blocks anyway. The 2nd layer (although I prefer alternative crypto currencies for the job) can then solve those daily-micro-nano payment solutions.

I was indeed talking about the Ledger, sorry for not being clear. The ledger has passphrase support but you can tie it to a second pincode so you do not have to enter that phrase everytime, but that second pincode.
I figured the passphrase is an industry standard which seems to be available also on Trezor, and using it won't lock me in to a Ledger Nano S (as in, when I lose my Nano S, I don't have to buy a nano s to retrieve funds), that's why I tried to make sure.
The passphrase pin support could be exclusive to Ledger, though.

It's not exactly a loophole when Bitcoin is not a standard payment system, and your gains will be taxes upon returning to the fiat land anyway, it's just added convenience until you can truly "spend" your gains in the "real" world.

The fork is supposed to be at 491407 as a snapshot, and the pre-mine will probably be until November 1st. They'll probably be doing internal testing and when they are happy with it, they'll do the pre-mining, from the snapshot.

More questions about full nodes from me. In the case of a hard fork, if I'm keeping my BTC in my own full Bitcoin Core compliant node, would I be able to syphon the forked coin from my address?
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:53:23
Interesting, I'm right now reading 
"Most full nodes also serve lightweight clients by allowing them to transmit their transactions to the network and by notifying them when a transaction affects their wallet. If not enough nodes perform this function, clients won’t be able to connect through the peer-to-peer network—they’ll have to use centralized services instead."
So this does seem like running "dummy" full node could help the network for lightweight wallets to accept the correct btc transactions? Or will a full node be unable to differentiate between a b2x transaction from a btc?

I hear you, buy I think I'm not good at articulating what I'm trying to mean though. One recent incident prompted me to think that way, where [Changelly requested KYC to be complied because a user wanted to exchange Monero.](
Surely, Monero's fungibility is not at question, it provides that. 1 Monero is always 1 monero, but since BTC and most others do not, the value proposition of Monero is reduced (although equally for all Monero's in circulation, because of fungibility).
This is precisely why you can not soft fork privacy features in BTC to get fungibility. You'd have coins with privacy features, you'd have coins without the privacy features. And this is a "self destructing" prophecy, as those with the privacy features will not be able to provide the fungibility the feature aims to provide, because of the segmentation within Bitcoins.

An agenda does not have to be a bad thing, it can be for the good of us, but trying to push that agenda artificially is not good.
I will have to read the Lightning Network papers, about how helpful it can be in a typical daily usage. However, having a 2MB block will not break the bank for anybody and will get a lot of the load currently, given the fact that LN is not even ready, and it does not preclude Schnorr signatures, Segwit, or other optimizations. It also should not mean we have to have terrabyte blocks in the future because we increased the block now.
1MB looking like an agenda to make people to want those extra solutions, and this is in part admitted here (  ), but if those second layer solutions will allow the orders of magnitude improvement, people will use them anyway even with 4 MB blocks, when they are ready. Why oppose an improvement that will help the current situation?
The current 2MB increase cannot create more centralization than Lightning network, and it also does not prevent it from happening.

I just want it to be a safe haven from fiat, that the average person can make use of without jumping through hoops, which can only be in a world that Bitcoin can co-exist with the existing financial system, otherwise they'd do anything to suppress it. They can't obviously destroy it but they can make it very hard to work with - sure you can create an alternative economy out of it even in that situation but the average Joe wouldn't risk it.

IMHO, Monero is fungible but only "within itself". Since Bitcoin is not fungible, using Monero may raise flags, which reduces it's value as a fungible crytpocurrency. Bitcoin cannot become fungible without being something else, because a soft fork cannot make it fungible, and a hard fork that brings fungibility would make it something truly different.

300KB is totally bonkers. Sorry Luke Dash Jr. Initial Block Download problem **can** be solved to the extent that allows daily use of Bitcoin, there's only philosophical reasons not to do so.
What would it do for me, if I can run the chain on my phone, but I have to pay 50 dollars for each transaction? Then it means I only use Bitcoin very rarely at all, like when buying a house or something. Be sure that I wouldn't want to be paid in Bitcoin if I had to pay that amount every month.
Edit: Wow at the 300 Kblocker downvotes! Anyway, there's no way Bitcoin will ever be a 300Kb choked chain so good luck with that. If running nodes is that important, BTC will turn into irrelevance if some bright minds doe not start to think about how to mitigate the IBD, not make the blocks smaller.

We are talking about country level trades - buying oil with Bitcoin and such, and this is what Congressman is implying mostly, this is not about buying burgers and pizza. U.S. cannot prevent that from happening but U.S. can act on countries that trade using Bitcoin, and also make that illegal for any bank that use Swift to engage in such activity. (E.g. you cannot transfer USD Money in string and digits to Iran and be part of the SWIFT payment system, U.S. also will not intercept a truck full of gold into Iran where it cannot place its soldiers, but it will penalize you for doing such trades with Iran.)

I find it fascinating that people do not choose any alternative over a mere 1 USD. I'd choose anything I don't know about instead of 1 usd. It could literally be canned turd worth 0.0000001 dollars (ignoring the value of the can itself) but it's worth the "risk" of not getting 1 USD in case it turns out to be something interesting.

One advantage of patreon is recurring payments, which Bitcoin naturally does not support. Recurring payments are important for the Patreon user, to create a steady flow of support, and the supporter only needs to worry about when to stop and not send x amount of payments every week...
So, maybe, there could be wallet standards about recurring payments. Instead of a third party handling this, your wallet software could handle this quite transparently and with you in total control, payment schedules laid out to you in full. The "standard" could work between wallets, would be ideal, but not at all required.

Maybe, but no problems with respect to security. You can't control who sends btc to an address, receiving is passive, so it would be a massive problem if one could reduce the security by sending to the same address.

What does this mean in terms of scalability of the network? What would it mean if 1 in every 10 coffee purchases in the world was made through LN? (With so many nodes having to connect)
I think they may need to have node groups to compress the topography (groups within groups) so you'd only need to know the topography within your own group. Is there such a thing already, or is it planned, or is it totally unnecessary?

I understand it may be different the U.S., however, there was no international law that prevented people using Euro as base currency for OIL trade, but you only need to look at what happened to countries that suggested doing so. And it's precisely what this congressman is afraid of.
BTC totally makes sense as an international fund transfer system, everybody can contribute to it's security, it's borderless, does not take sides. It's not yet mature enough to work like that though, but it may be one day.

The checkpoints are forever etched as rules in the bitcoin network. Any client that does not implement these checkpoints may not necessarily be served the current BTC chain \[edit: although practically nearly impossible\] as they'd be running different set of rules. They have to stay to faciliate the correct initial sync with absolute certainty.
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:56:15


No, typically if your software is not faulty you do not try the same "nonce", each leading to a different hash.
You may have read somewhere that "Mining has no memory" somewhere so you may be getting that mixed up, "Mining has no memory" tells us previous mining does not increase your chances of finding a valid block hash. The only thing you have to "remember" is to not try the same nonce you have tried, but that's easily achieved by counting, no mem required.

Sure you can own it and nobody can prevent it, but it doesn't mean you could be able to use your typical bank to do trades with it, which can be banned. Countries may not be allowed to trade with it. (They cannot be *prevented* from doing so, but they may live with the consequences.)

@_date: 2018-12-19 05:58:18
Lost keys, third parties doing bad trades and the irreversibility, hacked wallets - although all due to user error, these are added costs of using Bitcoin. The irreversibility requires Escrow mechanisms to be put in place but any trade that is not fully electronic, that has some physical or fiat leg, needs to have some third party verifying things. So at some points, you have to let go of your control over the BTC. You can't have a trustless trade in this situation and need some entity to verify.

They could also sign the document digitally and people can verify the signature with their public key?
The government documents electronically signed has a QR code and they may be authenticated from the government site.

Initial Block Download problem is the only problem that Bitcoin faces, regardless of blocksize. I hope all bright minds start thinking of mitigating the initial download first and foremost. And once the IBD problem is mitigated, there's little to NO reason to **not** increase the block size. Because if each transaction costs 50 dollars sometime in the future, whether you have 2nd and 3rd layers will not be important, or whether your phone can run it: people will simply not use Bitcoin anyway that will require them to keep a node with them.
There's a massive paradox here that "keep the block-size" people do not see (and "let's make them even smaller" people like Luke).

Indeed, due to the open nature of Bitcoin, we cannot have thick orderbooks at the current level of adoption as there are several exchanges. What we have is lots of separate order books - possibly good for arbitrage bots.

Strange.

The stack exchange post is by Peter Wuille, of course he knows his stuff, to say the least.  
Apparently, no chain can compete with combined PoW of the current BTC chain and since block-first sync is in place, the chances that somebody serving you the wrong chain and you losing time trying to download all those bogus blocks is very close to impossible, so the clients may not need to check for those anyway.  
Having said that, at the time of their inception, apparently it was a part of the concensus to say "At this block, you expect this block hash, no matter what other alternative chain with any amount of PoW is presented to you". It's also a little reminder to us that the BTC chain has those hashes at those blocks.
@_date: 2019-05-09 07:38:57
Of course Emin Gür Sirer jumped on the opportunity to dis PoW during this, making it seem like 51% bribe is enough. It's definitely not enough after even 9-10 blocks even for 7000btc (for 51% bribe, that is, because of the unbribed 49% that would want to hold on to their 4-5 blocks within those 10).
