I figured almost right away. I don't think the Internet has made it to parts of Scotland yet, let alone a currency that "lives" on the net.
Would be brilliant though.

So I am a full time streamer and currently make most of my income via donations from the awesome people who watch and want to support. I use a website called Imraising.com that has some interesting features that compliment paypal donations, most noticeably the ability for "pop up donations".
This is basically a browser window I can capture on my streaming software and, almost in real time, display the latest donation, donators name and custom message from them for a moment that overlays on top of the game.
This allows for immediate thanks and often funny messages that people leave. For larger streamers its a very specific way to immediately communicate with the caster.
If this could be developed for Bitcoin, I'm sure we'd see more people tipping in BTC.
As for Twitch.tv accepting BTC themselves, I have no idea. I know charge backs are becoming a huge issue on Twitch. BTC might be appealing on that fact alone.

I guess its not directly relevant, but we're both quite progressive in general and excited about new technology. I think its great how Bitcoin puts money back into the hands of the individual instead of the banks. We now have real options on how we handle our finances and can keep information private... whilst still paying our taxes and enjoying government supporting those who need it.

Its cheaper to buy straight from localbitcoins, unless you are putting out low buy orders.

It's a bit more complex than that, like with most things. Essentially, its the same job as the guys playing a musical instruments around a city and accepting change. We're not simply playing games for money, we're providing entertainment and fun and people can support us if they choose. Luckily we have some amazing people who like what we do so much, they support us so we can do it as a job.

I stream (although relatively small) and my girlfriend/stream-partner said I should include Bitcoin as a method of donation on our stream as well. We talk about Bitcoins a lot, and cryptocurrency in general, as we believe in it on a fundamental level.
We had received some BTC donations and it was awesome :) Our first one was about 4 months ago, someone gave us 1.5BTC when they weren't worth nearly as muc has they are now. Then the other night someone donated 1 whole Bitcoin and our minds were blown.

You have to decide how much responsibility your willing to take for your own finances, or continue using fiat currency. Letting the banks know your information, invest your money in what ever they want, hold your funds if they wish etc. 
Bitcoin allows more freedom with your own money, however it requires a bit more effort, as the paper trail is public. However, unlike banks where you usually have a single account, you can have multiple wallets all over the place that people will have no idea are yours or that new TV you bought.

Unless you dress like him, talk like him, think like him and accept his politics... you are uneducated, homeless bum who doesn't deserve to have money? Since when does politics, fashion or social skills ever overlap with intelligence/wealth?

Companies can generate a new wallet, QR code and paper trail for every invoice and transaction. Just like you can have multiple wallets to store your money in. At the end of the day, we have no idea which wallet belongs to you, we only know that you used wallet X at a certain time if we send you money.
You can be completely transparent, have all your coins in a single wallet, or have multiple wallets and move money around so that no one can track you solidly. Bit more work than conventional banks, but then again, you're in control of your money now... that's the point.

How long does SEPA usually take? I've seen the warnings it could take 5-7 working days.
