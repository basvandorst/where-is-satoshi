If they already signed an agreement supporting 8MB blocks, why would they also feel that it is necessary to signal that in coinbase scripts?
It would be more interesting if pools could signal if they will support XT or not, as it seems many chinese pools do not wish to run that software for some reason.

Does this mean they will agree to Gavins doubling every two years?

I dont understand why the nLocktime and nSequence fields are necessary for. With CLTV the absolute time is specified as a stack parameter, and miners only need to check the stack item against the timestamp in the block header to know if a transaction can be included or not. Same with nsequencee. For a CSV output with the number of blocks until spendable specified as a stack parameter, wouldnt a miner only need to check the difference in height from where the CSV output was included to the block the miner is trying to create in order to know if the transaction would be valid or not?

Can you point me to one of the blocks they have signed? Are they perhaps using GBT and thus only the miners who chose to include the message are doing it?

So it would not be possible to have different absolute/relative times for different outputs in the same transaction?

As much as I want the block size to be risen, Ver should stay out of it. He ruined his reputation with the MtGox fiasco!

I dont see any signalling by AntPool in their blocks. How are they encoding their message in their coinbase?

Is there a deadline when the voting is finished so that we can  know who won/lost?
