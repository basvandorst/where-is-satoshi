You must not have read many threads on r/btc.

Are there any decentralized exchanges that are working well? Or any that look promising for the near future? My hunch is that they're at least 5 years away.

So you want to take away the exchange managers' right to choose which coins they list? That sounds pretty anti-Libertarian.

Interesting thought.
Hundreds of years ago, decentralized exchanges in physical goods were the only exchanges. Today they're sort-of niche. Those who participate do it as more of a hobby. 
I wonder if it's possible to have a thriving exchange in the absence of managers to handle logistics and promotion.

Any recommended reading if I'm only 50% confident on how to do this?

I bought my first crypto in December. They made it as quick and easy as it possibly could have been. After I bought some, then I had some skin in the game, THEN I was motivated to learn about hardware wallets and p2p payments. But if it weren't for Coinbase, I would most likely still be years away from buying my first crypto.
They make a huge impact in getting crypto out to average people.

Don't listen to this guy, OP. I appreciate the comparison.

I'm having a hard time figuring out what you mean by this. Buy $5,500 worth of BTC while the price is $3,000? Then buy another $500 worth of BTC after its price increases to $3,500?
If I'm reading this right, you then buy another $6,000 worth of BTC the next month?

What are you saying? We should just hodl all the way until we die? 
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:10:37
What would that be?
