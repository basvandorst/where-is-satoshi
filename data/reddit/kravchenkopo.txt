Look at how Bitcoin is distributed now and who controls 51%. Do you think that average person (who at the end should be targeted to adopt crypto currencies) will mine?

From my experience, explaining what is mining and why it is needed is much more complex than telling that some servers together vote for transactions. Exchange in here has the same idea as in normal stock exchange - you post offers, somebody takes them.

No, it is not. You can use it without connecting Facebook. It is required just for giveaway.

Ok, now it is already around 12$.

ok, in 3 days 40000 people got their coins. But it is a long way ahead.

You can suggest a better way of identifying real people.

You decide who to trust on your own decision. Now you select particular bitcoin exchanges to manage your funds. It is not different from gateways idea - the same exchanges, the same level of trust.
If you want to know hot nodes communicate - there will be detail information. Now it is available on Ripple wiki too.

Still, Facebook is needed only to participate in give away. It is on your own decision. You can use the system without any registration, just ask your friend to send you some coins.
Phone numbers is very easy to fake - you can buy 100 sim cards - I don't think community will like switching from buying mining hardware to buying  sim cards to earn money. It definitely will be two-factor auth via SMS, but as additional channel.
Regarding "transparency" - do you think it is not important? Why then Ripple don't have so much users?

Most of big exchanges have already implemented KYC and AML requirements. How do you think people will exchange fiat money without exchange? At least you need dispute resolution platform (multisig, like Bitalo) but it is much slower than normal exchange. If to speak about high frequency operations - it is just impossible to do without a centralized exchange.

Stellar is a protocol to connecting the "banks". You can run your own. But the biggest difference is that transaction history will be transparent for everybody - imagine consequences for governments.

ok, don't worry then, there will be other options available

Obviously it was provocative. It is a bitcoin thread, but most of financial guys talking about blockchain in banks
@_date: 2016-07-21 21:27:29
I was not telling that everybody is doing wrong thing. My point was that blockchain became a confusing word and introduces a mess among financial guys. Specifically for that (fintech) I suggested a strategy - and I am not hiding it, it is an open discussion

I am not telling they are useless and not telling everybody is wrong. Specifically for that I put there a strategy that I think could lead towards solving real business problems, but there obviously could be different ways
