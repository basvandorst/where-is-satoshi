I'm not sure what to tell you. My last transaction was sending just under $400 USD to another wallet. I set a transaction cost of $1.40 and it was confirmed within two days. (I didn't check hourly, I just checked two days later and it was already confirmed) Although worth noting, this was on December 24th.
For me filling up a LN wallet, this would be totally acceptable. I get paid monthly for my job, so a ~$5 fee for filling up my LN wallet each month while waiting a day or two for it to confirm is totally doable and wont result in any stress or inability to make my monthly payments.

Do you have any input on possible downsides when using batch transactions over individual ones?

No. Lightning can transfer coins basically through other users channels to the channel you need them to get to. 
So for example we have 3 people, Alice (100), Bob(100) and Chris(200). Alice wants to send 50 coins to Bob and opens a channel with Bob to send them. Now Alice has 50 coins left and Bob has 150. Chris also needs to send 50 coins to Bob and opens a channel with Bob, so now Alice has 50, Bob has 200 and Chris has 150.
Next Chris wants to send 100 coins to Alice. Both Chris and Alice have channels already open with Bob, so instead of Chris opening a second channel with Alice, Chris can use the existing channel with Bob to send Bob 100 coins (so Bob now has 300, Chris has 50) then Bob uses the existing channel they have with Alice to transfer that 100 coins from Chris to Alice. Now Alice has 150, Bob has 200 again and Chris has 50.
So instead of Chris and Alice needing to use a second channel, they find someone they already have a channel open with (Bob) to transfer between. Now in the sense of only three people transferring between each other, this might seem pointless. But when you have large numbers of people using the network setting up a large connection between them, it makes a lot more sense.
In theory if you open a channel with one 3rd party, someone else will also have a channel connected to that 3rd party in some way and will then be connected to another 3rd party and so on until the network finds the link you need.

My math may not be the greatest, but I think 850million is a lot less then 7 billion...

I understand that batching or not people can still figure out payments coming from the same address due to it all being public. Batching just makes it a little easier to see who else is getting paid at the same time as you at least.
Privacy isn't the biggest concern for the situation I'll be using though since it will already be information that can be found online for who is using the service as its not anonymous. That's why I was wondering if there are any other non-privacy related concerns with batching transactions.

Ya, I think the linking addresses is the main thing since it would at least allow people to figure out what other addresses are being paid out by the one address. Although I have thought of some ways to mitigate that issue.
I'm also thinking now doing monthly batches may not be the way to go and instead doing daily or even weekly would be better, which will greatly reduce my transaction size.

Also to note on that $20 transaction you do to "fill" your savings account, generally speaking this would be coins you don't need immediately to be accessible via LN. You can send that using a smaller fee and wait a couple of hours for it to confirm. Then it will be in your LN "savings" account for the next day to use over the next weeks/months. This would cut down on that $20 price on its own.

When first opening your channel with LN, you in theory are opening it for more then one transaction and aren't opening it at the exact time you need to make your first LN TX. This means you can set a lower transaction fee on your initial opening since you shouldn't need it to be confirmed instantly and can wait a couple hours.
Then later on when you need to make small instant payments, you would use that LN wallet that was loaded ahead of time. 
Since you would only really ever need to use LN if you plan on making many smaller transactions, that initial fee for opening and later fee for closing are the only two you will get hit for. (and again, you can set lower fees since you shouldn't need those to be instant). For large one-time transactions you wouldn't really want to do that's on LN and would use the normal Bitcoin transactions as the larger fee wouldn't be as much of an issue.

The use case could involve needing to send hundreds of transactions, so I would likely need to do it in more then one batch. 
I understand the fees would be more then a regular transactions but unless I'm incorrect it should still be less then doing each transaction on its own?

This is nothing new. They use Xsolla which has had these options for a while. Also you need to go through Bitpay or Coinbase...

Changing the software to be called the same as the coin would add more confusion, not help it.
I prefer the name Bitcoin-Qt and would rather it of stayed that, but renaming it to just Bitcoin is not a good solution.
ShapeShift was not "confused" by anything. They intentionally called it Bitcoin Core to please Roger since it was an announcement about partnering with his site. They know the difference between Bitcoin the currency and Bitcoin Core the software implementation. Just like BCH has Bitcoin ABC for the software name.

The youtube video by them announcing this and showing people how to use it still refers to it as "Bitcoin Core" from the voice over on the video and in the description. The newsletter they emailed out to people also used the phrase Bitcoin Core.
So they haven't even fixed the mistake, they only re-made one tweet.
