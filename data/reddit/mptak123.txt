I am Genesis Mining VIP customer. Currently there are issues with tickets. It is taking forever to sort them out.
From the bright side everything works just fine for me apart 5 missed payouts in the past.
Since I am with Genesis Mining I almost triple my money so I do recommend to be patient and after all you will get your hashpower plus all missing payouts.
I doubt that they will refund the initial investment.
Recently they posted on their blog that they sorted 100k out of 130k tickets but not my one.
Next BTC contracts will avaiable in November most likely. Pre order activate from 31st of October as it states in contract and it was announced before the sale was live.
In my honest opinion this is the best cloud mining company out there and i sincerely advise people to jump in.
Once again it is my personal experience but if you will make up your mind please use my AFFILIATE code which will give You 3% discount from initial investment.
3% promo code: uQtLeP
Also as a VIP client i have 5% discount code but it is not affiliate code so i will give it away once you use my 3% code first.
From my experience it takes about 6 months to ROI(return of investment) but keep in mind that difficulty and price changes all the time.
