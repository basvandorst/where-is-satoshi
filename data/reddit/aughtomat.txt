I'm holding a couple BTC and about 14 ETH. I've been astonished by how much they've appreciated in a short time...
But I've no illusions that we're in the early days of crypto currencies – this could all come crashing down tomorrow, perhaps usurped by a newer better currency.
I think it's foolish to write off the phenomenon as a "fad". But it's equally foolish to assume these currencies will continue to soar in value. 
I'm not converting back to dollars anytime time soon, and may even invest a bit more. But the irrational exuberance around here seems...irrational. 
I'd not put my life's savings into BTC is what I'm saying.

Weighing in to say that I’ve also had no issues whatsoever.
It may not be a popular opinion, but Coinbase is the most legitimate and professional entity I’ve interacted with since investing in Bitcoin a year ago. I’ve bought and sold multiple currencies without the slightest hitch. 
I’ve read the horror stories and criticisms too, but I’ve had nothing but a great experience.

It’s nonsense like this that prompted me to cash out months ago. 
I may opt back in, in time, but this irrational HODLism is insane.

When you say "everyone can have some" what does that mean? Will BCC show up in my wallet, or do I have to claim it somehow?

Can you unpack that for me a bit?
I've an existing BC wallet for which I hold the keys. Where can I create a BCC wallet, and how would the claim work?
The consequences of the UAHF aren't clear to newcomers like me. I'd love to understand it better.

Exactly what I wanted to know! Thanks. 
Much easier to manage one recovery phrase than two.
I think I have the latest version of the app. It works, but I *wish* the currency conversion worked. It's a bummer to see your digital currency with a $0 value next to it...

Updated and it works great! 
It gives me more confidence in the app to see this working.
