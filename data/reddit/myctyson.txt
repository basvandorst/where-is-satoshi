The OP is a paid shill, u/roccsmoker hired him. The service is shit and one should avoid it as you would a known shitcoin.

OP is also a scammer! I'd avoid this, asked me to post a few links, I did - never paid and ignored all messages afterwards. [BitPatron.io]( is a no-go.

Don't use this service, OP is a scammer.

You're definitely a scammer. This service doesn't deserve promotion, avoid it like you would a shitcoin.

I apologize, you're not the scammer. posted to hire people on to post links to his awful looking site &amp; failed to pay after delivery. What a stand up guy. Definitely a scammer, you're alright in my book &amp; don't worry about your 'competition' - he's not got what it takes.

~~This service &amp; poster are scams.~~  
is the scammer, can't even pay people on for to promote his shitty service. Avoid this users services - though one look at the website and you'd do that automatically.

This post was solicited by u/roccsmoker \- but [u/roccsmoker]( is also a scammer, and this service should be considered a joke.
