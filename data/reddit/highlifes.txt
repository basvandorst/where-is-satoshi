No jokes. If you cant see the potential in some of these coins, that's your loss.

you can load your bitcoin on to a mastercard via ANXpro. works alright :)

Unfortunately by the time most Europeans realise it will be too late to save their wealth. Thats why I pro actively support &amp; keep a keen eye on certain cryptos. For me that includes bitcoin, startcoin, maxcoin &amp; hell even dogecoin ! Because when this bubble pops the shockwave has the potential to not only reek havoc to european stocks but also impact the wider global economy. Anyone else noticed the NASDAQ racing out of control during all this fiasco?

My thoughts exactly

I would definitely be cool but until that day we have a nifty chrome browser extension that does a similar job with blockchain.info

this is not trash, if you wish to be ignorant thats your problem. but as for the rest of us,... this is something that is VERY pertinent to bitcoin and the worlds economy at large

Thank you for highlighting whats actually going on here.

I would be very wary of xapo at the moment as a friend of mine had lots of problems with xapo, especially with their in-ability to keep track of deposits and reflecting users balance. I'd be very careful using them.

this made me chuckle 
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:38:04
oh yea they need cookies to track what your doing with bitcoins and everything else about you.

If I had some monies I would chip in to the cause. I have the utmost respect for David Nutt and hope that others will see this is a worthwhile charity and donate to the cause

Download the chrome browser extension:  
Once installed you simply highlight any transaction hash or address, right click and the click "Search Blockchain.info" and viola! :) Simples

only good thats come from this post is that I'm now listening on teamspeak :) these are some sound people in teamspeak, OP is talking nonsense

Im really looking forward to the release of Casheer. The maxcoin community all rallied round to ask if we could be included and the good folks at Casheer were really accommodating. Cant wait to use their app !

Great job on that interview Simon. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:02:42
this is the most informed comment I've read all day. Well done ! :=)
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:41:57
THIS ! exactly this. Come on Coinbase are you really so naive as to think we have all forgotten how you want to know everything about anyone that uses coinbase ? Did you think people would forget that you are now the biggest threat to the community openly using bitcoin in a free manor ? Did you forget that you were asking bitcoin farms for photos of their miners along with other business info ?
More importantly did you think bitcoiners would forget about your shenanigans for a mear 70k USD ? I mean some might but thats only because the world is kept in perpetual poverty 
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:16:00
if any of you got some maxcoin I'm buying...
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:17:30
Redditor for 3 months, yet he thinks Startcoin is a scam coin.... hmm...
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:52:42
A very worthy cause. Will chip in a few pounds as I'd love to see this bank be taken apart. Their share price has been bleeding today due to scandal after scandal.
