Alright — the per-client bet ID is basically the spin number. So if it's your first time playing, it's 0. If you've played 100 spins, it's 100 and so on. You can obviously verify that this ID is valid and hasn't been tampered with since nobody can influence it but you, by actually making bets.

Right now the entropy comes from Unix's PRNG, we're looking for a way to make it provably fair — any suggestions for randomness sources? Making a slot machine provably fair is much more difficult than for a game like SatoshiDice since there is one transaction for multiple spins.

Very good point! Bet IDs aren't generated, they're sequential, so they go up by one for each bet. However, we're actually in the process of changing these to per-client IDs, so you can verify that the ID hasn't changed unless you yourself made a bet.

Thank you for your post — that does sound pretty amazing and I would actually consider attempting it in the future.

I think it sends all the cash directly to purse exogan.
