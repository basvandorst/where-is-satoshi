Wow. Thanks for the advice, i had paypal withhold my funds before, and only got it back after 90 days over one stupid mishap,I never want that to happen again. What wallet do you recommend?

Yes i tired coinbase, however for some reason they flagged my account (new never used account) for "suspicious activity".

Thanks for explaining all this to a noob like me. This is all so new to me. So if i get an bitcoin wallet outside circle. My best bet to sell them, is not with circle but an local bitcoin exchange in my local area? Its so much more convenient to do this online. However it seems services like circle and coinbase. Are untrustworthy in this regard. Are there no reputable online services. I can cash out, without fear they'll hold my money?

Hello ive had a circle account for about 6 months now. And i can vouch for your statement how simple it is to buy bitcoins there. My question is. Up until this time as soon i recieve bitcoin i transfer it to my bank. Im looking to start saving my bitcoin on circle, and hopefully get lucky when bitcoin's value raises. My question to you is. Why do you recommend sending bitcoin to a separate wallet. What is wrong with storing my bitcoin on circle? Thanks. Sorry im a noob.

Yeah i know im stupid i just saw that. My thinking was the price already included the discount. Now i will remember to keep my btc/USD calculator to see, the real value.

Could you please explain to me. Which deals have the %50 discounts for the customer? I just accepted that, the exchange was 100% equal. $92 for $92 worth of bitcoin. How hard is that? At least put somewhere in the description. How much discount the person wants. This is ******
