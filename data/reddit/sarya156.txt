It's absolutely a huge risk, anyone outside of this specific subreddit and random uninformed people will tell you to be extremely careful and to not just jump on the bandwagon. Remember that the people who you are asking this question on here profit if you invest. 
Bitcoin is currently a bubble, it *will* pop and then accumulate value more organically and with a more informed base but until then it is certainly not safe to invest unless you can afford to potentially lose most of it.

What is your problem? Why do you need an apology when someone called you out for misrepresenting Nakamoto's viewpoints. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:52:36
Surely you're joking

So is the whole, 'defy all logic and refuse to even slightly increase the blocksize' thing being done by blockstream because it makes it almost impossible to sell large amounts of bitcoin, keeping buyers hostage and artificially raising its value as people wait desperately for an off-chain solution to liquidate their 'investment'

How idiotic
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:38:55
Poor Satoshi, what a numpty
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:33:43
well zero fee has never and will never exist, what are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:16:27
Why would any miner ever do that? It just doesn't happen, and what wallet can you put 0 fee for wtf?

You're serious right now? What TX BS, this is exactly what the problem is, nothing more or less but the block size being too small. Sure, increasing the blocksize continually is (very arguably) unsustainable, but there is **no** reasonable argument against increasing the blocksize a considerable amount (or even a small amount) until an off-chain solution is realized and actually implemented. The LN is *still* not going to be fully implemented in the foreseeable future, no reason to cripple bitcoin in order to do so.

And then BTC's fundamental value and privacy is lost forever
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:52:00
Well that's an oversimplification
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:25:15
Or if they don't just increase the block size in the meantime which literally *no one* * should have a problem with
