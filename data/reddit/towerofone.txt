You think comparing something you have to buy into, and spend real dollars on, and ultimately end up speculating on the price of, to a free app on your iPad is "fairer equivalency"? Malarky!
When someone adopts Bitcoin, they end up risking their money, and making you richer. That's nothing like recommending a free app.

People in the Bitcoin community KNOW that what we are told to do by countless "authorities" is primarily for the benefit of said authorities. In the best case, what the authorities want from us isn't overtly detrimental to us. But par for the course is whatever the authority tells people to do, greatly benefits the authority to the detriment of the people.


Yes, but the "authorities" at Google and Microsoft and Apple *had* the power to push email encryption very hard before the NSA wrapped its tentacles around the Web. If only Gmail had automatically encrypted all gmail-to-gmail emails with PGP; had the standard caught on, we'd be looking at a very different PGP and a very different email experience. Specifically, the state of modern PGP user experience wouldn't be that of Geocities circa 1999.
Be willing to stand strong for what is right for the common man. That's what we care about, Gavin. That's what we're here for. Personally I have my doubts, because I **know** what happens inside of people's psyche when they are staring down the barrel of a gun. No offense to the core Bitcoin developers but I strongly doubt they are capable of doing the right thing as the pressure from global authorities becomes ever-higher to turn Bitcoin into a yet-another surveillance haven.
Think about how easy it is to avoid that fate. Take Tor browser bundle for example. Here we have a clear cut, PROVEN way for the common man to opt out of global suspicionless surveillance online. Sure, it's not perfect, but if hundreds of millions of people used Tor browser all over the world to browse the Web, we could very easily return to a world with real freedom of speech and freedom of assocation online.
And who has the power to make that world a reality? Anyone who is in a position to bundle Tor browser with their major operating system. Microsoft has that power. Google and Apple do too. Humanity really can pull itself out of the rut its in, if only the authorities at the top of these organizations are willing to *do what's right*.
Every core developer of Bitcoin HAS that level of authority over Bitcoin's userbase, which for all we know is still growing strong. The developers of Bitcoin have in effect elevated themselves into a position where they really can force masses of people to make the right choices about privacy and governance.
For the love of God, be willing to stand strong for the good of mankind.

I'd rather bring silver coins than gold bullion to the supermarket. Same goes for LTC and BTC. If your choice is between spending LTC on a giftcard, [and you can]( and spending BTC, then you're going to draw down your LTC balance before your BTC balance. Given the choice, why give up the more valuable currency?
And that's what gives any cryptocurrency value, is the fact that people are willing to spend it, trade it, arbitrage it. LTC is the second most traded crypto after BTC. Has the second highest liquidity and network security.
Nothing anyone says can shake my steadfast belief that BTC is on the highest rung of the value pedestal while LTC is on the second highest rung. LTC is infinitely easier for me to spend than BTC, because I would rather spend it first. At the same time, it's a carbon copy of Bitcoin, with a different hashing algorithm just in case, and I like that.

When I first got involved in Bitcoin years ago, price was not a factor. I expected the price to go DOWN.
The story I told myself was "well at least if those scumbags in power decide to screw me over, I'll have enough money to survive for one month in Thailand".
I figured even if every government outlawed Bitcoin, the Silk Road alone would be enough to sustain a price of $1/coin.
That's why I bought Bitcoin. Bitcoin was my get-out-of-Dodge insurance. I didn't buy Bitcoin to speculate on the price, and I sure as heck didn't buy Bitcoin because of the lower fees.
Compare that to the reasons people get into Bitcoin these days.

The ether founders have a free ride to riches.
Between now and ethereum's launch date, the investors are left holding ether IOUs while the founders have liquid BTC.
I am just stating objective facts.
Think about what would've happened if Ethereum had foregone the hyped up IPO. They would still be doing the same work they're doing now, and you wouldn't have your BTCs at risk.
Exact same product, except only the founders have to shoulder the risk until launch date. That would've been infinitely more fair and equitable than what actually took place.
The ether team easily could've pursued a fair altcoin launch schedule, but purposefully chose instead to take your BTC up front while they build the product. They have a free ride, you have IOUs. Investors have historically been fucked on these terms, remember Butterfly Labs?

What if this guy is just saying this because it financially benefits him, has to be one of the most common objections a person can encounter, and it cuts across everything.
People are constantly rehearsing what-if scenarios in their mindvoice when talking to new people, friends and family alike.
As early adopters of this technology, it's easy for us to lose track of the macroeconomic forces that brought us to Bitcoin. Government power is increasingly overreaching. Monetary policy is being dictated by centralized power structures that are corrupt everywhere. The middle class is shrinking.
Before I bring up Bitcoin to anyone, including friends and family, I need to know right then that they are an investor looking for investment opportunities, or are cognizant of these societal level issues. Most people are neither one, and do not care.
Talking Bitcoin is talking about people's money no matter how you want to present it. Anything at all to do with Bitcoin carries with it an investment angle, because it IS money, literally speaking. Hence conversations about Bitcoin come with time-tested "this person is giving me financial advice" baggage.


Most people are driven by hate, and consumed by fear.

Counterparty is doing the same thing Bitcoin has always done, which is reward its core userbase for evangelizing the platform. And that bothers you.
There are only two other ways I'm aware of to build a "trustless" order matching engine on top of Bitcoin:
1. Hard-code the order matching engine into a sidechain. Problem: we're yet to see a secure implementation of sidechains
2. Open Transactions and voting pools. Problem: we're yet to see a secure release candidate of voting pools and the whole concept remains untested and unadopted by the market.
It truly doesn't matter where you turn to in Bitcoin, someone is going to be there to take your money. Be it colored coins trading platforms with their API usage fees, or Blockstream Corp with their fee-based sidechains in theory only, or Open Transactions with their company launching proprietary products on top of it, someone is always trying to get into your wallet.
But to your point, Total Cost of Ownership will be determined moreso by dividends and how often the assets move than by up front fee. You pay a BTC fee each time you make a dividend payment or move the assets around, on any bitcoin-based platform. That's a decades-long recurring expense for serious issuers and it has nothing to do with the up front fee.
You're getting caught up on the idea of an up front fee being paid in a way that rewards all those vested in the core platform being used. Counterparty is a protocol that works like Bitcoin. The "cost" of using BTC for remittance is rewarding all those vested in the Bitcoin platform. The price of creating a trustless order matching engine on top of Bitcoin, is the engine has to come with *its* own token so that it can both match orders and move values around as the market decides. The side effect is it aligns the incentives so that adopters of Counterparty are rewarded as the platform gets used more. A lot of people don't like that, because they were told Bitcoin would do everything for them as well as make them rich.

Look, if you wanted transparency, you should've donated USD to the United Way.
I'm serious, and it's not like Sean's Outpost did an IPO. We're talking about no more than 500 BTC. Where were you ninny watchdogs when Ethereum IPO'd for $15,000,000?!
Sean's Outpost didn't force you to pay him at the point of a gun, either. He didn't promise to act like United Way. He's feeding homeless people fucking sandwiches on his own time! You're putting his balls in a vice over pocket change. It's disgusting.
And it's really not uncommon to forget to file an annual report with the state you're incorporated in. Annual reports like that are a formality.
You demand Sean to go into full detail on every penny he's received in BTC? Once you know how much he has, who's to say you won't then demand to see the addresses where they're currently stored. Probably signed too. It's ridiculously invasive.
Then you'll want to have authority over what Sean's Outpost spends money on, when and why. Jesus Christ, are you a shareholder of a Fortune 500 company here? Fuck no you aren't!
Oh, but Sean's Outpost should be like United Way "because that's how charities are supposed to be run"? OK, then make your own fucking charity, genius boy.

Agreed. No one knows how this space will shake out over the next few decades. So long as LTC is liquid, I don't see a problem with it. LTC is the second most traded cryptocurrency. Very high trading volume. Maybe in 10 years Bitcoin core development goes one direction and Litecoin goes another, then in another 10 years it ends up making a difference. Who knows? In some sense, Litecoin is a political system secured by a different hashing algorithm, and IDGAF so long as the market is liquid.

I admit it's been awhile since I've read the BIP39 spec, but at the very beginning, I remember Stick and Slush were saying how they didn't like the Electrum list, and to use theirs instead. Then when no one could agree on whose list to use, they moved on to "ok well let's just make the word list not matter and do this other checksum thing so that it works and internationalization is good mk". Which ignores the fact that you can have consensus around a Japanese wordlist just the same as you can an English word list.
But really it was because there was no consensus that BIP39 moved to becoming the clusterfuck it is today.
Now we have a situation where there's no consensus among wallet makers with BIP32+BIP39, but steady belief amongst casual users that BIP39 means your wallet works on other wallets. And if your wallet doesn't work with my wallet, yours must be out of fashion. And is BIP39 *that* good? Is it even worth it?
If I knew of any good reasons to use BIP39 instead of Electrum's original system, then it may be different. But I don't. I see the entire BIP39 thing as being a political move on behalf of the Trezor team to own a bunch of BIPs and then force them on the entire ecosystem.
Alternatively, Electrum could've just set the standard English wordlist and derivation system itself before Stick and Slush did their thing.

Denying the investment aspect to Bitcoin exists only works on Reddit.

You are entirely off base from a legal perspective.
Now let me give you my perspective.
It sounds to me like we've got a bunch of drama queens here who have never donated to Sean's Outpost in their life, but somehow feel slighted that it's not being run like the United Way.
Then we've got the people who donated and are just butthurt their BTC donations to Sean's Outpost could potentially be making Jason King rich 20 years from now when BTC is moon.
Both groups erroneously assume that because Sean's Outpost isn't tracking each and every 0.0000001 BTC he's ever received, there's a chance he could be hiding away some for himself.
The fact is, unless he was keeping impossibly meticulous records since before Sean's Outpost registered as a business in the state of Florida, there is no way for Jason King to prove a negative. You can say he's hiding some for himself, and how is he to prove otherwise? I hereby accuse you of hiding 10,000 BTC. Prove me wrong.

Read the whitepaper, and I'm left feeling this definition is a bit contrived. How does the network itself pay out interest revenue to holders of LC? What's the issuance model behind LC? What's the supply cap? Is LC premined?


Differences between the intended fully decentralized solution, and your MVP?
Is your value proposition accepting BTC from investors, loaning out investors' BTC, and then paying investors back a proportion of the interest payments you recover, plus LC? Why would I want to take the risk as an investor? Does your company pocket the BTC in exchange for LC?

As an outsider, you have no way of knowing if those trades are real. Even the volume subject to fees could be faked.
Unless I'm just missing the "magic" and "bewilderment" of trading on OKCoin, I have a lot of trouble believing the hype. Anyone repeating OKCoin's own propaganda could be shilling for a bucket shop. And no, they could be hunting tight stops and front running trades just as well if Tim Draper invested. I would actually love to hear what he thinks about this thread, but I've never seen him comment on reddit.

I'm assuming OP got himself into a predicament this past tax season. I have a very strong feeling we will hear about dozens of people who will lose tens of thousands to the IRS because they can't prove basis on coins they bought at $500-$10,000. Labeling your transactions is instrumental in avoiding that fate.
If you can't prove basis on a coin you bought for $10k cash, and you spend it, you're hosed. Bitcoin is treated like property, so you have to record that as a capital gain against a $0 basis unless you have perfect receipts. You have to be able to trace the origin of your coins to a carefully documented event that will hold up to IRS scrutiny.

I also feel like a gramps. Electrum was the original "HD" wallet before BIP32 existed. It had a wordlist before there was BIP39. And now people see BIP32 and BIP39 and think "why doesn't electrum support the standard". It does support the standard in the latest dev version, but that doesn't mean the standards process isn't flawed or that the standard is any better than what it has been doing for years.

You can't trade USD like you trade BTC. Anywhere there's USD, there's a chance the banks or government could freeze it, reverse it or devalue it right out from under you.
The very best you can do is trade cold hard cash for bitcoins. At least then all sales are final. But even then you run into counterfeit notes and other criminal issues. On the one hand, there's the risk of a violent holdup, on the other, the government could imprison you for not having the right license.
Centralized exchanges do this better. You need a trusted entity to collect millions in reversible payments from a large number of customers all over the world. You entrust the centralized exchange to 1. do the due diligence necessary to repel fraudsters and to 2. actually have the money they say they have.
The only possible quasi-decentralized solution is Ripple or Counterparty, where you can have GoodUSD, GreatUSD, BestUSD, and so on represented as colored coins. The colored coinUSD can then be [exchanged on a blockchain]( without counterparty risk. But you still have to trust the issuer of GreatUSD to pay out the USD on demand. GreatUSD would have 0 value otherwise.
You can trade neutral tokens like BTC person-to-person without having to trust an issuer, which is a double-edged sword. How many times have you heard detractors say "Bitcoin isn't backed by anything!", and yet that is what makes Bitcoin so much better than fiat.

OKCoin has been caught red handed numerous times faking trade volume. As an exchange, it appeared seemingly out of nowhere in 2013 by displaying unbelievably high volume numbers; up to 1,000,000 BTC and 10,000,000 LTC traded daily, UNLEVERAGED. That is more than 5% of the total monetary supply of BTC and 20% of the total monetary supply of LTC. They proceeded to toot their own horn as being the "largest" Bitcoin exchange.
OKCoin reps are constantly shilling on this subreddit and They are rumored to be running a bucket shop and are in general the most unethical, deceitful bag of dicks on the Bitcoin exchange scene. Please excuse my exuberance, but OKCoin's checkered past warrants this level of skepticism.

Is their idea for people to move BTC to sidechain 1 and then automatically execute a contract with app logic hard-coded to the sidechain code? I was under the impression sidechains are duplicates of Bitcoin Core with added functionality. In which case, the sidechains would operate much more like an altcoin. You'd need to convert BTC to the alt, and then store the alt in a compatible alt-wallet, and then you can do things with it. That is really not far removed from metacoins; the only difference is you don't have to speculate on the price of the underlying. Or maybe you do, because sidechains aren't proven to be secure?
Also, if we are speaking of futures contracts, that is placing large bets on the blockchain, and trusting it with very large trades. There would be a huge incentive to attack such a system. This is just to say, security of the settlement engine would be paramount to anyone. Bitcoin is today the world's most secure, and *neutral* token ledger, and it will likely always have the highest hashrate because of the fact that it is totally neutral.
I'd like to wager the real underlying problem Blockstream has with their competitors like Counterparty is not primarily to do with technical details. It's that so many people have been told BTC is all you ever need. The price your friends must bear to use Bitcoin for remittances is that they enrich all BTC holders. With Counterparty, people are worried the same will not happen for securities, options and derivatives trading. They want to be able to do it all using the same resources.
I would just like to point out that this isn't a winner take-all battle between platforms. After listening to the CFTC hearings on Bitcoin, while Jerry Brito's explanation of Bitcoin was wonderfully clear, certain people are far more excited about using a fraction of a BTC to represent financial contracts than using it as currency. To that end, Counterparty transactions each incur a separate BTC transaction fee. So BTC is still the reserve currency to both systems. If sidechains works better for that than Counterparty, ok then launch it. Same thing to Open Transactions and their voting pools. Each team needs to launch their respective platform before pitting probable future features against live production code.

I own both Bitcoin and Litecoin, and in my experience, I'm spending the LTC first if I can, [which happens to be the case at hundreds of merchants](
Again, just my subjective experience, but I'm doing this because I'd rather crack open a LTC cold storage wallet than a BTC cold storage wallet. It's like if you had to choose between two fine wines. Are you going to crack open the most expensive aged shit you have for dinner and a movie, or are you going to go with something more reasonable.
Both BTC and LTC are better than the USD in the long term, and LTC is the second most liquid and secure cryptocurrency.

What? Look I'm calling out these guys for being shills but I don't follow your logic. Their logic actually makes sense because, what else would they do? Give away BTC for free? How does that benefit their network. If they gave away BTC, no one would have any incentive to stay and evangelize.

BIP39 sounds very confusing. Maybe I'm missing something, but if the idea was to standardize around 2048 English words, why was a new set of English words chosen and not the original set from Electrum?
As I understand it, the only reason the Trezor guys were pushing for the 2048 version was because they complained about certain words in the original 1626 being "hard to memorize" for non-native English speakers like themselves. Their solution: create a new standard English wordlist! Because, why not?
*Why not*?
Should a non-native English speaker really be dictating the **English wordlist standards**?!
Your wallet could use the exact same BIP39 wordlist as some other wallet, and it would NOT work as intended. Because, not only do the two wallets need to share the exact same wordlist, they need to share the exact same **BIP32 implementation**. For those of you not familiar with BIP32, it's essentially the logic for generating your HD wallet and it takes several variables. A difference between variable A in Wallet 1 and variable A in Wallet 2 will mean Wallet 1 is not compatible with Wallet 2. It doesn't matter if they share the same wordlist. If Multibit does its BIP32 hierarchy one way, and GreenAddress does it another way, the two wallets could have the exact same wordlist but not be compatible. In other words, BIP39 is a clusterfuck. The only saving grace is it's encouraging new wallet makers to do the same shit Electrum has always done with mnemonic codes which is a far superior method for Bitcoin storage.

If Sean's Outpost was a scam, it was horribly inefficient. And he has his USD costs recorded! Have you ever tried tracking every last 0.00000001 BTC that touched your Bitcoin wallet? Not one of you who has ever moved Bitcoin around could do that for yourself, under an IRS audit, which isn't far from what the OP is asking for. The whole thing is distastefully presumptuous.

I'll believe that as soon as you show me how you would track inputs and outputs through Blockchain.info, *assuming* multiple inputs are combined in one transaction, and that same transaction pays out to multiple addresses. Which address ultimately received your input? How will you prove *you* are the owner of that address? What if this same thing happens again, only the input that *may or may not be yours* gets sent to a shared wallet on Blockchain.info? What if, instead of Blockchain.info, it's MtGox or InstaWallet, services which are no longer open. What if you no longer have that wallet? How can you even track at *this* granular of a level?
No offense, but that doesn't sound "absolutely easy" to me, at all. There is no chance I'm doing that for a random person on the internet. It would be one thing if the IRS audited Jason. But that isn't what's going on here.
And now we have people accusing him of fraud. Perfect! For a self-respecting people billing themselves as being above the paygrade of the modern banking system, we sure are classier. We should be thanking Jason for doing more for Bitcoin than we ourselves have done, not hanging and shaming.
