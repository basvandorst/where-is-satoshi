Did a mistake, learnt a lesson.

Do ya think it's gonna dip?
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:54:31
You got me right here.
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:29:08
Oh, thanks. I'll just make a quick edit.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:50:34
Yeah, this is what I exactly feel. We need more of a market space to have it as our daily use because as of now people with around 1000 BTC can determine/change the market value of it and make small investors/believers feel like being manipulated. A stable market value it worth this technology .

That means "at the door"
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:36:59
Thank you, but when will you think it will be a value of liability more than a asset?

It's midnight here, I got it and definitely will print and start reading it tomorrow. Apologies, but it seems like my mobile can't open the format you send.Could you please let me know what application I could use to open the format :)
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:00:16
Sure, will do that. Many many thanks for the book, will you please suggest me an app that could open it.Forgive my naiveness,but it has been a great help from you:)

Actually, noone knows man, market speculation and increased interest because people now saw it could get to $20,000. I think if we could get past 9,000-10,000 range, real FOMO will be there.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:01:52
Go for it right now !!!

Thanks for your suggestion.And I definitely wanted to read that book "The Bitcoin Standard ", infact I searched a free online version of it since couple days to download and print to read but couldn't find any.And  due to fact that its only available in Amazon or other sites requiring USD to buy, but there's no way I could do international transaction from my county (very shitty laws I admit).I'd be grateful if you could provide me any ways so I could buy the book( even using Bitcoin).
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:08:29
Sure, just started reading The Bitcoin Standard today, I'll look into these too. Thank you :)

This ain't a sub where you can scam people with your shitty, throwaway account. Get the fuck outta here.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:18:05
How is it? Will you please elaborate because I really want to know.How will its value going to increase if everyone is just into holding it and not spending. Because in day to day life we'll need something to transact to make a living.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:42:24
Please forgive my doubt but just wanted to know when will it's real life application will come to exist :)
