Do you not care that the *community*, i.e. the end users, generally seems to support a block size increase?
How do you address the community's fear that block size will be hit and this will negatively affect Bitcoin, along with its utility, and stunt its growth? (Do you think we are simply wrong, and there is nothing to fear, all Bitcoin commerce will continue, with transaction backlogs causing no problems?)
Do you think Bitcoin should simply stop growing until your better solutions are available and proven?
Unless opponents of the increase come together and address these fears, in a highly public fashion (as Gavin has been doing with his blog posts), a whole lot of people will be opting in to larger block sizes as soon as some dev releases a fork. (Driven by emotion and irrespective of much intelligent thought as to whether this will hurt the network.)

Except, labour was in power when most of the infrastructure was built.
The choice, in Britain, is between the authoritarian left or the authoritarian right. Both want utter control. They differ only in which sections of the general population they throw a few meagre bones to.
But really, it's not entirely Labour or Conservatives fault - it's also the fault of the other, large, entirely unelected bodies who are able to convince the MPs that they need such and such powers. Intelligence services, police, etc.

I think this is the post most people refer to:


It's somewhat vague, but seems generally supportive of increase "if we get closer to needing it".
There is also stuff like this where a much larger block size is clearly implied:

Wish a dev would release a simple patch that implements something like this, with no hard limit on blocks.
I will run that as a full node. Who else is with me?

I do care. But not addressing a majority's fears does nothing. You could compromise and support a smaller, more conservative approach. 2 MB. 5 MB. A short term small increase while better solutions are worked on. Why don't you do this? And why is a 20 MB increase so terrible anyway? What exactly states 20x less decentralisation as so bad, given that current amounts of full nodes are fairly arbitrary and not ordained according to some special plan?


That includes me, by the way.


It would be great. Do it, please.




THANK YOU. You actually went pretty close to addressing the community's real fears there. Now please make a highly public series of posts like Gavin, illustrating this point to the community.


That's plain silly. The world is not your perfect system of math. It's people and emotion. If Bitcoin can't withstand that, it's *never* going to work. Rather it says that Bitcoin is not yet ready for the world, and isn't the solution we all hoped for.

It's ONNN! It's fookin' ON! YEAHHH!
As soon as this is ready, I'm gonna run a full node VPS of Bitcoin XT.

I have one, haven't used it yet, key difference is it's not a chip card so might not be accepted in as many places (especially europe).

(1). It's mastercard (suraglobal.com written on it), but without the chip, magnetic stripe only. I think some places at least in Europe require chip to pay. (2). You top up your anx account first, then initiate transfer to the card, I got a "funds loaded" confirmation the next day. Haven't actually paid/tested it yet though.
