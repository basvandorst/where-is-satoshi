Those two pizzas changed the course of cryptos today.

No one said it was gonna be a 24/7 thing. If I had an app that counts how many times I open blockfolio a day..

Have you heard of Turo? People lease cars and rent them out as a business. Some people pay off their entire years lease in 6 months, due to the margins. Go download the app do the math, it checks out. There's articles of people breaking down the financials if you are interested.

I've had nightmares that my sell orders aren't triggering and a specific coin is melting down. Like I am spamming sell sell sell and nothing happens. I wake up, check blockfolio, feel better, go back to bed.

Imagine Joe and Bob. Joe and Bob are both miners with $100,000 each to spend on mining equipment. Joe buys 20 miners for $5,000 each and immediately puts them to work for himself. Bob, on the other hand, buys the same miners, but instead of using them for himself rents all 20 of his miners out and recovers 80% of his initial investment from cloud mining contracts. Bob then uses that 80k to buy 16 more miners and rents those out as well. Again, he uses the money from the contracts to buy even more miners and repeats this process several times, eventually ending up with 70 mining units in total.
Four months later, Joe's 20 miners manage to mine $100,000 and he has completely covered his initial investment. Bob, on the other hand, earns nothing, but his clients' cloud mining contracts expire.
An additional four months later Joe's miners earn $80,000, slightly less than the previous four months due to an increase in network difficulty. Bob, on the other hand, free from his cloud mining contracts, now puts his 70 mining units to work for himself and earns $280,000.
Joe's total profits having only mined for himself = $80,000. Bob's total profits, having rented out his units and reinvested = $180,000.
I'm not a miner. I'm pulling these numbers out of my ass. But it's food for thought.

But its a big issue because this is the most mainstream coin. Pump and dumps happen all the time for alt coins, but because its bitcoin and a fork of it, and on coinbase, it becomes something else.

Hey man, everything is hindsight 20/20, don't beat yourself up. Everyone, I mean everyone goes through this, why didn't i buy more? why didn't I sell at that price? You only rationalize these things once it passes. Its easy to be hard on yourself, but everything is a learning opportunity. Keep at it.

Going to get down voted to oblivion here for this but here we go, to piggy back off what you're saying you can't mine it, its pre-mined, and the company can create as many XRP as they want. So people are actually trading coins that need to be mined, such as ETH, BTC, things that are in limited circulating supply, is insane to me. Eth is precious as fuck, look how many of the coins are ERC-20 tokens. Not salty, I have my position in Ripple, actually forgot I even had it since it wasn't doing much for so long, but I wouldn't trade all my Eth and Btc for it right now.

Just want to say, if it weren't for all of your sacrifices of early retirement, we would not be where we are right now.
 Adoption is key, I understand the HODLs and the lambo moons, but without an actual use case, it would all be irrelevant. Your lawn power, the HD, Nintendo DS, and that pizza, paved the way.
