 thanks for your contribution to the community. I just wanted to let you know, people follow your action. I told all my friends to leave coinbase until the implement segwit and showed them how cool segwit works on their trezor.

I almost panicked because I feared it my Monero Paperwallets have the same issue. But they dont. Monero simply never had this problem. How is that?

Gemini is unfortunately not available in Germany.   I am done with Coinbase. Can you say which exchange to use in Germany (except slow kraken). Thx

Not adopting segwit which results into extremely high tx fees, accusation of frontrunning und insider trading. I am just frightened that my asset will be frozen in Coinbase because they are seized or under investigation.

any information how they got hacked? 
@_date: 2018-06-20 07:56:15
That’s confirmed?

I will travel to Mauritius. Can I pay there already with bitcoin?

Why do I have to deposit balance on my LN?
@_date: 2018-03-19 07:12:38
I understood LN in that way, I am providing channels/gates for others using my gates, no? Is the LN address different than the Segwit address?

I agree. But if you put yourself in the position of a bank, you would probably feel comfortable in leading this centralised approach - with all benefits (and more) of a decentralised blockchain, or am I wrong ?
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:35:42
Ha, that’s an excellent question! Let’s assume that centralisation is wanted (e.g. a bank for their customers). That said the CA for this would be the bank. Could many of such centralised public blockchains using some sort of atomic swaps be able to replace existing legacy payment systems? How likely would you see this coming?

Nice Coinbase, now I need to shift all my transactions back to you. Why so late ;)

Hey folks, are there anywhere the slides presented at MIT BTC Expo? Would be much appreciated to read over again.

BeagleBoard is back in the game. I am asking myself if one could run a full node on the new BeagleBoard and if yes what the advantages are in comparison to a Raspberry Pi full node.

One critical question to this. If the bitcoin core developers one time decide to change the maximum supply of bitcoin, are the able to change this? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 07:18:39
I will come to India and bring you some bitcoin ;)

I run my own LN BTC Node on Raspberry PI (LNCLI v0.4beta) and paid to bitrefill via lncli payinvoice "DISPLAYED INVOICE ID" my reddit gold - faster than you realize its paid.
MY BEST BITCOIN SPENDING EXPERIENCE EVER. From now on I will buy everything from you guys. I've seen you have Amazon Vouchers. I will try it.

Nice. I like it sitting next to fellow travellers at Düsseldorf Airport hearing one explain Bitcoin to one another after watching it in the news line.

Sometime I experienced that the wallet.dat created under Linux does not work under windows bitcoin-qt. this happened under rain-condensate. I more like the method of creating paper with seed (one hand-written, second electronically and encrypted on offline device).

Thanks ! - Are my BTC, LTC, ETH savely stored on my TREZOR?
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:21:31
