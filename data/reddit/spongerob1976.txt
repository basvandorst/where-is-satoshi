GPU/CPU mining is long gone.  Neither can hash nearly fast enough with low enough power consumption to make it worthwhile for mining.  ASIC's are the only option for mining right now.
ASIC's are special chips designed with a single function in mind.  The BTC mining ASIC's are built just to mine SHA-256 hashes which is what BTC uses.  THe fastest GPU's can maybe do 1GH/s at a cost of around $700 a card and consume a lot of power to do so.  The cointerra ASIC miners use 2 - 4 500GH/s ASIC chips which don't use nearly as much power as a GPU/GH and cost around $6K.

you can try  to buy up to 1BTC with your debit card in Canada.  They run out frequently so you need to keep trying if you really want to get one that way.

I think what a lot of contract sellers are doing is starting the contracts in late Feb or March when they receive the miners in December or January. They make their most money while the difficulty is low and once their return has diminished they sell shares to scam more money from people.  You likely won't make any money other than maybe your money back in those scenarios.

No better time like the present.
You could wait for another dip or you could miss the climb back up.  There is no way to predict exactly what is going to happen.  It will be a gamble regardless when you decide to jump in so why not now?

If cointerra isn't shipping until March now then it may not work out in your favor.  That is getting pretty late to turn a profit.

I personally think/hope there will be a correction soon once $1k hits with the prices dropping again.  I am waiting to see if/when that happens then I will buy back in.  If I were you, I would get your money in now to an trading account so you can be ready to buy when the price drops.  Would suck to wait until that happens then find out it will take a while to wire transfer the money so you can buy and miss the opportunity to buy as low as it goes.

Mining can be good if you get in early enough.  Buying BTC a year ago instead of investing in miners would have worked out much more in your favor.  However, with BTC prices so high right now there isn't as much of a margin to make money by buying BTC.  Some people are still speculating that prices will go up but the likelihood of them doubling from current prices is pretty slim in my opinion.  If you play the market and are lucky as the price fluctuates you can grow the number of bitcoins in your wallet slowly but that takes some luck and a lot of time commitment.
Buying a high hash rate miner is just a set and forget setup and the coins will churn in over time.  The only catch with mining is you need to be on the leading edge of the curve.  Buying in too late will not make you any money.  Be very cautious of purchasing a miner right now though.  The difficulty increase may make it unprofitable quickly and there are a lot of people trying to flog their miners to recover their investment.
With that said, the entire network needs miners to continue.

well keep trying.  I haven't used it yet but saw the link in another post some time ago.  If it works for you maybe let us know so we can all try it out...
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:16:01
Yep, panic sells.  People think it peaks then sell.  Then as others see it dropping they try and sell so they can get their money out before it goes too low.  Seeing the downslope on the charts freak the nervous ones out.  It is a bit of a downslope right now actually so who knows, maybe some more people will panic and drive it down some more!  I am hoping that happens so I can buy back in.  Sold too early myself...

Hopefully this is not a scam although it sounds too good to be true!  I bought 5BTC + 0.4BTC for just under $1K.  I will let you all know if it comes through!
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:09:58
Do a search on here.  There is a guy who does some wallet recovery.  Not sure about the multibit wallet though...

If you get in early with the new/faster miners the returns are good.  If you are late to the game then the returns aren't worth it.
At this point you need to just jump on a low cost/high hash rate miner right when it is announced so you can be early on the delivery so you can make some good coin from it.

never heard of that site before.  Interesting though.  Seems a little shady but might be worth checking out

You should actually consider the cointerra IV miner since it does 2TH for $6K with a delivery date of February sometime.  The monarch may be much later than that based on BFL previous history and doesn't offer the same returns for the money as the cointerra unit.
I have been considering a shared mining setup but haven't found anyone to share a cointerra with me.
