Yup.  Fucked as well.

Actually 7 months.  Where do you get this BS from?  My post history is also a lot longer than that.  Maybe you should learn to read.

Now all we need to do is get back on the moon....

Apparently the best ones!

Seems that on the 1 Hr. chart someone has been gradually pumping this up by making huge buys.  Looks like slow-and-steady approach.  See if the price "sticks" and then hit it again like 12 hours later.  Of course hovering just inside of 7K they are going to have to fight if they want to keep it now.

Spoofy up to his old tricks again, eh?  Sounds like the beginnings of a true recovery! ;)

Because I used Changelly for almost a year dealing with only the occasional technical mishap which was corrected fairly promptly.  Did it with similar sized transactions as well.  It appears something really shitty has been going on since the beginning of February though - I had no reason to suspect this.  Do you do everything perfectly all the time?

The problem is they are leaving everyone in limbo for weeks and months.  This is retroactive KYC - as in you don't know they are filtering they seize your funds after you initiate a transaction, cancel your transaction then tell you then need more info.  Then they don't reply.  Also, they are based in the Czech Republic, not Switzerland.  Yes, I've used them in the past without problems but it seems they started doing this back near the beginning of February - at least judging by user comments.

The reality most likely is they sold/exchange my coins and those of others and have to essentially buy them back to return them.  I think this is why they have been dragging their feet.  Hoping the market tanks and they can buy it all back low then return you your devalued coins so they are then not technically stealing.  Screwed up.
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:45:37
LOL, so true!
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:37:28
The KYC part isn't the illegal part.  The problematic/perhaps illegal part is not telling anyone there is new KYC then stopping your transaction while it is running, holding your coins and then finding out you have to beg to get them back.  With or without evidence of a crime doesn't matter.  Get it?

Buy $1000 now and see how it goes.  If we break $7500 buy the remaining $1000 worth.  If it drops below $6850 sell what you bought.

I don't think this guy wants to day trade.  He wants to get in without getting wiped out.  Better to buy in an uptrend at that point.  If it isn't trending up get out because he can't afford the loss.

Banks have no reason to adapt and compete because they pretty much run all things financial through overt and covert collusion.  Sad state of affairs.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:36:21
It really isn't.  They used to be honest (at least with me) so a part of me wants to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they just really botched implementation of their KYC.  But their actions and their Reddit make it really hard to do that.  Hence I think it is fair to at least tell people what could happen to them.

BTC could use a hotshot of volume on GDAX - I can't remember the last time I saw 7000 24 hr volume.
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:58:35
They used all their pump money keeping this thing from tanking completely.  All they have now is couch seat cushion money so maybe someday we'll see 7.5K again.

Thanks for the tip!  Now all I have to do is get my stash back from Changelly....
