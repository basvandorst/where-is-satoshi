Bitcoin good, gold good. Do what you will, I have both and am doing well with both
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:34:25
It certainly has some quality to it. The fees are quite high. I bought more btc right before this recent run (pure luck) and I double looked at the fees. Still if it gives you a sense of safety it’s worth a little more. Then again I have only used Coinbase so I don’t have much to compare to.
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:42:04
No I actually already have my bitcoin so it will be others pockets
@_date: 2019-07-17 06:16:44
Dude for your hope they don’t. No one in this sub is rooting against you I hope you make a gazillion dollars
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:54:42
I know panic as it drops a few thousand then freak and buy back when it gains a couple thousand no way it can go tits up
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:41:46
Security wise they have so far proved themselves. I can only imagine the amount of hack attempts they get
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:15:34
Well it sounds perfect to me. Can anyone tell me one way this could go tits up, it can’t. What kind of rate did you get on the loan. If you answer the question you will probably subtract from the actually amount. In all honesty I think it’s kind of dump. Sure we borrow money to buy houses and cars and values on them can swing but betting on bitcoin with someone else’s money. I would have sold some stock and put that into btc you obviously feel strongly about it. Plus if it did go tits up the bank would be so happy to see you struggle to pay them back, well I hope you didn’t borrow from a friend or family member. In the end it done, you did what you did so good luck. Is this your first time in bitcoin, you are gonna have fun. I love waking up finding I lost a couple thousand then a week later I’m out lambo shopping.

It’s hard to throw rocks when your mooning so it probably safe.
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:40:31
When u say no you mean u have no idea. I don’t believe this would impact btc myself having said that I have not learned a lot of googles new system here. If anything, in my eyes, it gives more credence to btc not less
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:14:17
Oh yeah cybertruck drive it on the moon

Chairman Mao alone killed an estimated 80 million of his own people. Brutal bastard.
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:05:54
It’s either go to be a good thing or a bad thing. Or it’ll stay the same 
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:09:30
If you are just throwing a little money into you should be fine. You won’t get rich of course but I think the lambo days of btc are over. Many of us hold with financial gains in mind but in my mind it’s more of an anti federal reserve type of thing. So everyone is right, learn as much as you can about anything you are putting your money into but that’s what you are starting to do by asking here. Good luck

Stop thinking btc vs gold just get both
@_date: 2019-10-31 05:05:24
The senate and congress members themselves are ridiculous but then they start appointing family members to million dollar consulting or other government jobs to family and friends. That’s on both sides of the aisle but Harry Reid has some crazy examples. The only ones who can put term limits on them are themselves and they are all power hungry and who wants to give up that money available to them. I always thought a great revolution by the people would be voting a clean sweep. Every sitting incumbent voted out. I wrote a few letters to local papers that made it to print but it’s a useless thought. The incumbent has such an advantage it’s crazy. I really hope AOC doesn’t become a lifelong member of the club. Darn I said something bad about AOC here come the downvotes
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:06:19
You need to calm down. I have plenty of btc gold stocks and some real estate. Only a fool wouldn’t diversify.
@_date: 2019-08-26 03:42:21
Bitcoin is going to be so big we are going to get tired of winning
@_date: 2019-08-26 01:54:53
The sound of one hand clapping
@_date: 2019-08-11 23:13:10
If we get some fomo yes
@_date: 2019-08-24 21:11:14
Sure dude look at all the similarities. I think btc is a great thing but completely unique to gold. Buy both.
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:09:03
No way is that going tits up
@_date: 2019-08-24 17:48:26

Bitcoin is dead for the 600th time
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:43:05
Cough cough, yeah.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:35:38
Is this shit going to hit 11k. This is parabolic no way can this go tits up
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:20:40
I like gold. I like gold, bitcoin, stocks and real estate. My smallest position is in crypto but I’m glad I’m in it.
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:01:19
Agreed, might as well remain positive. I don’t have a lot of btc but have a number of etherium. I really think it will also have use. I have 700usd sitting in my Coinbase account. Debating more eth or btc. Maybe just go for the gusto with btc. Not looking to become rich off it but as long as it remains secure I think it will have great promise
@_date: 2019-10-31 05:09:04

Yes if the irs is listening I did

Oh no it dropped a few hundred, bitcoin is dead again. Wait till it drops 3-5k in a couple hours that’s living
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:01:01
Not really but I do have a lambo

@_date: 2019-06-26 00:56:22
Hey anyone have informed info on stellar. I bought 100 for 12 cents or so as the little research i did gave me some confidence in it. TBH it was just a little gamble.. fortunately right after I did it I bought more BTC so I’m not concerned but of course I’d like to see it move.  I see at its high it was .94 cents but it is certainly not rising with btc as some alts do.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:05:55
I don’t think so. If one chooses to go 100% in on btc more power to them. I think the 100,000k to million dollar calls are unrealistic. I don’t see diversification as weak. I’ve hung my ass out on several stocks. TBH my rental property is risky. One bad tenant can screw you big time. I’ve done well over 8 years of renting but just recently almost got screwed. Ended up just being a months rent. Now I have a state group home wanting to rent, if it goes through it’ll be long term, hopefully. When you have hundreds of thousands hanging out where major losses lurk around the corner, mind you this includes btc, ltc, eth and stellar. Looking how others invest is a good learning tool. I could learn from you if you are a 100% crypto guy. I’ve been holding for years, I really like it, more so for it’s screw you Fed but the money doesn’t suck. So please tell me what you see as weak hands, the fact that I add gold and silver or diversification in general? On some stocks I’m up well over 100%.
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:03:25
No way can this go tits up
@_date: 2019-12-20 18:44:52
Does the argument bitcoin stealing gold holders really make sense? I have both and don’t compare them. To me it’s apples and oranges. I think people become attracted to bitcoin once they have a decent understanding of it or fomo mars and cyber trucks

I sat in a few months 2,800 with sideway movement for close to a year, then a boom and meme galore, rinse and repeat

@_date: 2019-12-22 02:50:59
If I have to reach more than six inches to reach a bitcoin atm I don’t trust it
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:08:47
We often talk about lack of adoption of btc but seeing it being used in Venezuela (in unfortunate situations) and how it is helping certain areas of Africa show what it can do. I’m sure satoshi would or is very pleased. I have no clue what will happen with the price of btc in the future, of course I’d love to see it moon for my cybertruck but I feel being a holder makes a statement.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:53:00
Can I move in with you for a while? You can drive my lambo
@_date: 2019-12-10 00:34:52
Shit the Venezuelan government attacked their own people
@_date: 2019-12-04 02:55:34
Any info on bitcoin transactions in Venezuela currently. Is it being accepted at stores etc or mostly peer to peer and blackmarket. What is the Venezuelan government view on bitcoin. Now that I asked these questions I’ll google them to find out, actually I’m switching to duck duck go
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:15:24
Dude sorry you hit a rough patch. It’s life things are always in motion. I hope the worm turns and you get some positive turnaround. Also hats off to whoever tips those satoshis. The amount doesn’t even matter it’s a real cool gesture
@_date: 2019-04-07 00:01:13
What is btc at now. I try not to look at my Coinbase account. Then I start looking at it too much. Did it fall well below 5k yet 
@_date: 2019-04-03 22:03:27
Fuck no I’m on Reddit I just talk shit why are you 
@_date: 2019-12-03 19:27:41
It’s a long term very negative effect on an exchanges name anything is possible but I have doubt
@_date: 2019-12-04 02:40:59
Well that’s what I was trying to say. Screw saving on taxes if you are going to ruin your companies name for ever. If you don’t have security you don’t have crypto. God forbid Coinbase gets hacked someday
@_date: 2019-04-03 14:19:04
Let’s say btc does hit 20k again, which I doubt, there would be a crash as everyone who bought at the ATH and lost their shirt will want their money back.  Unless they get FOMO again 
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:15:49
Ah thanks, I see ltc has been on a tear lately. I never know which way this stuff is going to go and I’ve been in it for years 
@_date: 2019-04-25 02:01:21
Think positive maybe you will be here still
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:12:32
Well long may you rock my friend.
@_date: 2019-04-04 20:59:56
I hodl yeah sure I think of the financial side but I’m more interested in the tech and possibilities behind it. If one day it becomes what it is intended to be it will be amazing. When I sell stuff online I always at least offer to accept crypto. I’d do any of the major three although TBH I never bought anything with crypto yet. I figure at least I’m offering to accept crypto well knowing it could go tits up the minute I get it I’m at least participating in what it is meant to be. We all know how fast 100 can go to nothing. No one has accepted the crypto offer to pay yet anyway. I hodl partly because I hope it becomes an FU to the Fed someday. I doubt that will happen but I want to keep my powder dry in case the revolution happens. I also did accumulate quite a few eth as a long time ago I had great promise for it, now not so much, but screw it, it’s part of my powder supply now 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:11:28

Shit dude I would def talk to a lawyer

Ha no but my wife works for black and decker so I have 5,000 dollars worth of new tools but no balancer sorry 
@_date: 2019-01-27 04:38:51
Sad thing is I’d prob to the same stupid stuff so why bother 
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:42:57
I think it’s still worth everyone holding at least a small amount. You never know what will happen 
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:38:29
I give u credit. I wish I could give u advice other than contact a lawyer but I know nothing about them. I think u said u were given 5k to open the thing, didn’t your funding source give u info? The only thing I’ve heard is those btc atm charge outrages fees. Continue your research and who knows if there is another pump maybe it will work out. Good luck. You may learn a lot and it could move u onto better things as well
@_date: 2019-01-27 04:41:22
I sell a lot on shit on Craigslist always add the crypto option never had one offer. It’s okay I like they have the option. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 06:20:07
Plus this far it is its history. No guarantee but it could moon again  I’m not betting on it though 
@_date: 2019-09-15 02:18:36
I like my iPhone 8plus and I like bitcoin. Can’t we do both and call-it a day
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:29:09
So everyone has 6.15 bitcoin now right
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:40:51
That’s the new thing some guy was on here bragging about his 6.15 bitcoin so it’s catching on. He probably has .0006

I’m surprised people get surprised of bitcoins volatility.  I guess it’s good people still getting in. You get a quick lesson in volatility with bitcoin. Just hold a financial amount that won’t keep you up at night and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:11:07

I’m seeing million dollar predictions again. I gave up a long time ago trying to figure this stuff out. It may be the whales manipulating, fomo but now they added in its due to the trade war with China which has been going just fine with no effect on at all. It would be nice if the whales would just let us bottom feeders have a nice taste. Give us normal people holding our scraps a nice boost and maintain it. I picked up a little more btc at about 4,500. If anyone ever figures this shit out please tell me.
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:45:38
Dude this sounds good to me. What has having these offices full done for us the past 20 years 
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:16:07
I can’t help thinking this myself. I hold bitcoin. Bought a little more early in this movement phase but I’m not overly excited or talking about lambos. I was impressed btc held on to that 3,000 dollar level so long. Now I figure I’ll just watch it, I see people getting excited but I’m still yawning a bit. I’m trying to decide a point to sell, wait for this bubble to pass and get more at a better price but I gave up on trying to time btc
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:48:17
Does this work out when btc was at 3k or are you guys getting FOMO new guys. It sounds like a cool idea you have just wondering if it’s profitable. Do you guys consider adding solar. Is the person who rents out the building making more money? Just curious it reminds me of a set up I saw in China.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:40:29
Yeah we will kid ourselves I’m reading all the 1 million dollar predictions again. It’s just fun to hold some and go for the ride
@_date: 2018-12-26 12:56:32
Well at least u picked up I was exaggerating.
