Think about it like this. You use Reddit. There are tons of websites like Reddit. Someone could make a website like reddit this very second. But you use Reddit. That’s why it has value. Same with bitcoin. It’s pretty simple.

I never once said it was untraceable.... it's literally inflation. Its very traceable.

A steeming pile of cow shit the same size is worth more than all those bills. Very sad to see what has happened in Venezuela. I lived in Caracas from 2002-2004 right before things started to go seriously downhill. Venezuelans are some of the happiest people I have ever met they don’t deserve this. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:37:28
I would rather an economy in which a government doesn't have absolute power to devalue my currency in any way they like. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:42:26
Tell that to a Venezuelan or pretty much anyone in a 3rd world country. Inflation is a tool the government uses to rob it’s people. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:20:34
There's always something to rob. There will always be someone taking advantage of the system especially one like fiat currencies which make it easy to do. 
Also who says the government are the same people? Government is influenced by the rich. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:32:08
This is a fallacy. Inflation is not healthy. Plus who is to say that it will always stay at 1-2%. Very few countries are able to maintain that. Inflation is only favorable in the short-term. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:16:24
Government prints money, they now have free money and now the peoples money is worth less. That to me is robbery. 
It just happened in Argentina. Government took on debt they could not pay, they had to print money to pay it off, this caused inflation and the value of the peso to drop significantly. Now peoples salaries are not worth as much. Robbery. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:44:20
This is a fallacy. Inflation is not necessary to incentivize investment and spending. This is just what the government has been teaching us by forcing Keynesian economics down our throats. Turning the population into materialistic consumers with a high time preference who live pay check to pay check and can't build a shred of wealth. Inflation became a government tool when they needed money to fight wars and finance goverment spending that they could not finance with taxes.
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:48:46
You are so out of touch with reality. Of course they don't do it for "no reason". THEY GET FREE MONEY. Even if its worth less. This free money allows them to finance more government spending that taxes alone can't cover. In case you didn't know World War I and II were both financed by massive inflation. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:27:12
Governments promise lies backed by the interests of the few/rich. They also have all the power to influence people through education and media. While the people do have some responsibility we can't just say "oh its your own fucking fault, retards".  
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:27:00
Are you stupid? If they print money...it's free money. There was no economic activity behind that money, it came out of nothing. I understand government spending is well documented. Im not saying some gangster bureaucrat  is printing money for himself and spending it on a yacht. What governments do is take on debt (for example for war) and then pay that debt of with inflation. Essentially, inflation is another form of tax.
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:49:54
How do you think they put it into circulation? They don’t just fucking throw it out onto the street... 
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:17:04
Andreas confirmed on reddit a few days ago that it is just a rumor that he is going back on Joe Rogans podcast. Has that changed? 
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:35:28
Bitcoin is the blockchain you can’t separate them. A blockchain is just a fancy database without bitcoin(or a comparable cryptocurrency) backing it up. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:52:15
Because the litecoin network is smaller meaning less miners/nodes.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:59:58
Yeah true I guess that could happen. If some bug deleted all the private keys or something like that.
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:01:16
Do you understand how bitcoin works? Why are you here? At least tell me why it doesn’t make sense, or point me to some of your research. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:09:11
I don’t know enough to dispute this. But I feel like it probably would have happened by now if it was possible. As long as you keep your private key secure and off line I don’t see how this is possible, but again I don’t know enough. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:44:10
Nope. Bitcoin keeps the blockchain secure. Without bitcoins game theory and financial incentives the blockchain would easily be compromised.
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:02:25
Bitcoin is literally immortal. It’s price/use could go to near 0 but it will always be around as long as we have the internet. Gold on the other hand can be destroyed.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:56:15
I live in Argentina I’ll take bitcoin over my governments money any day. I actually do sleep better. You’re just part of the privileged elite with a passably working system that can’t see the benefit of the separation of state and money.
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:45:42
I do realize that. But those blockchains are almost entirely worthless because they are centralized. They defeat the entire purpose of having a blockchain. A centralized blockchain is vulnerable to manipulation and becomes a fancy database that uses the term Blockchain as a buzzword.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:44:14
It will never go to $0. Someone out there will always see the value in btc. Even if it’s just a few people it will have some value. If it drops to $1 I’ll tell you right now I would buy every single one and many other people probably would try to do the same. The only reason it would go to $0 is if the dollar disappeared and we stopped comparing btc to the dollar. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:51:00
Dude Satoshi created bitcoin as a direct response to the crash of 2008. It’s literally inscribed in the first block so that we can never forget what happened. 
Exactly, so much for your sound monetary policies in the US that allowed something like that to happen in 2008 and like you say will allow it to happen again in 2020. Your system works but it’s far from perfect. Bitcoin is a step in the right direction that has the potential to bring more transparency to systems that take advantage of its people.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:04:16
It’s not totally centralized but definitely not as decentralized as bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:10:24
Fantastic exchange. Very reliable. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:11:01
What is there for me to learn. Show me some resources. And you should educate yourself more on how Bitcoin works because you really don’t know anything about it and you’re spreading misinformation. By the way this is the inscription satoshi put on the genesis block of the bitcoin blockchain “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for bank”. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:45:07
Trust me your controlled monetary policy isn’t as great as you think it is. No matter where you live. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:09:23
When will people finally understand this. It’s so frustrating when people say “bitcoin is worthless, blockchain technology is the real innovation”. People are so clueless around here, even on this sub. When we hit the front page it’s even worse. A blockchain without bitcoin(or a comparable cryptocurrency, which there is non currently btw) is not secure. It is just a fancy database. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:06:59
No shit and over half of the fucking world. This is a good thing for billions of people! 
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:09:23
Lol are you stupid? What do you think happened in 2008? The entire reason for bitcoin being born. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:50:44
It’s not easy. But it’s possible. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:22:14
You did if you sell when it rallies back up. And then buy the next dip and repeat. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:33:34
This didn't happen....anyone who did their research on Bitcoin for a whole year would be smart enough to not tell the internet how much bitcoin they bought/have.
@_date: 2018-12-16 05:16:21
If you bought at any price below 2-3k I would say you made a pretty intelligent call, wouldn't you? It's all the dummies that jumped in at 20k trying to get rich quick who are the dummies. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:58:40
10 btc is 30,000 dollars. People get robbed for much less. It’s just not worth the risk. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 05:14:25
A lot of people in Crypto value privacy so it's not like it's crazy for us to tell others to be cautious about telling people how much you have. Also it's much harder to recover stolen bitcoin, the legal recourse available to you is not the same as if someone steals your car. There is no hidden agenda here. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:56:01
Pretty much. Just like you wouldn’t go around telling random people how much money you have in your wallet. Also there’s not much legal recourse if you get hacked. Also bitcoin is sudonymous meaning that if someone figures out/knows your btc address they can track all your transactions to and from your address. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:51:00
Very true.
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:03:42
Just like you wouldn’t tell strangers how much money is in your bank. It’s common sense advice given in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:27:44
Totally overkill I agree with you. My point is that this post is probably fake because someone who seriously waited over a year to buy btc, did all their due diligence, learned the tech, studied cryptography, etc etc (as this guy claims) would most likely not go around announcing his purchase to reddit. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:02:15
It’s just common advice in crypto. You don’t want to be a target for hackers. Like you wouldn’t tell strangers how much money is in your bank account. Also if you do get hacked you’re shit out of luck, there’s very little legal recourse. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:46:00
3k is nothing? Damn. Crypto sentiment is seriously in the shitter. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:47:44
So do you go around telling strangers  you have a million dollars sitting in your house? 
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:48:34
Well yeah that too lol.
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:51:53
Because you're painting a target on yourself to potential hackers. It's like going around telling strangers how much money you have in your bank.
