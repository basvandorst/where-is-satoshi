Wow! You are a very nice person. Thanks! I will definitely be more careful now

Yeah I am excited to try that. Not any places accepting btc around me though.What is amazing to me is how the second I hit send on my phone it already shows on my computer.

That will be much easier to keep. Ill just get more btc
@_date: 2015-09-19 00:11:29
is this a joke

It says could not decrypt file, check your password. I know I have the right password because I wrote it down when I backed it up.

I am not so worried about losing 10 bits since it's less than a penny. I am really a begginer at this. So my current wallet it copay. How do I add the fees when sending bitcoin to that wallet with my btc wallet. Also, is this when sending btc to anyone?

Using the coinomi android app
@_date: 2015-09-19 17:00:03
I use coinbase already and it takes 4 or 5 days
@_date: 2015-09-17 12:19:54
Ill just stick with my copay wallet.

I should have been more careful when I backed it up but I was new to bitcoin.

the idea of ledger is cool, just don't have enough btc to make it practical. I did buy an OTG adapter to support you guys. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:17:03
very cool!

Thanks for the help and the tip!
@_date: 2015-09-27 17:27:55
Well why wasn't the backup working?
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:35:03
After reading a bunch of stuff trying to figure out what why the 21 computer is so special I finally understand. thanks!
@_date: 2015-09-19 00:06:18
I thought this would be compatible with copay :(
@_date: 2015-09-16 23:05:23
How do I add a fee
@_date: 2015-09-16 23:42:33
I can send my btc from my copay wallet to other places besides mycelium. I don't know what the deal is.
