I lost 30k in btc, I somewhat can relate to that feeling . 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:15:37
Can somebody explain to a newbie what this all means?
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:48:51
So the price has gone up since they borrowed and now they have to buy it  back at a higher price constituting a loss?

Can a whale please buy into BCH for me pls.
I bought BCH at 2300 believing all the hype

I’ve got two 5 card Vega 56 rigs I’m still holding on to... Desperately waiting for prices to recover to 10k to start mining again.

Kraken allows up to 100k with verification processes
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:51:11
Somebody did it with 300,000 at 1700 and sold at 2300 yeah that guy 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:12:07
$700 a month
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:24:23
I've got about 3 already I can sell those and just keep the 30,000 in there to keep as a cushion in case it fails I can pay some if the loan off
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:10:16
Thanks! I'll look into that. This cash was just sitting in an account. But I do plan on using it in the future for a small business with some other moneys.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:06:35
But that's what everyone said to the guy who borrowed 300,000 and is laughing at us rn
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:18:17
Should I put the last 5k in my CD account into BTC?
ETH has had a great week too.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:19:13
But I wouldn't have the loan for 5 years. Only if bitcoin crashes. I probably won't even have the loan by the end of the month
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:40:40
It'll take 45 days to be approved. Currently applying for a 30,000 personal loan that should be approved today.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:43:58
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:01:58
Getting a $30,000 loan today I hope fucking the same.
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:08:27
No it's all the money in the world to me. I plan on starting a small business using it and other capital a few years in the future
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:55:02
Think so. The guy put his house down as collateral. I'd just be paying 700 a month 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:14:18
Think it's 5
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:14:26
I could buy tonight if I needed to or I can wait till it pulls back. If it ever does anytime soon. The money has been sitting in an account for about two years gathering dust. If only I invested it then ��
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:47:54
Yes it's risky. But it's been going up at least 100 every day for almost a week now. And it seems like that trend is going to continue
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:42:05
Tell me why. I just started investing almost 2 weeks ago. and I've been using coinbase
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:24:53
12 I believe
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:22:48
Flipping a house
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:10:50
Yeah... good thing I didn't buy, but now would be a great time.
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:22:04
Wait.. I already did.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:13:21
Taking it out in a few weeks and then paying off the loan. Not just gonna let it sit there till it crashes
