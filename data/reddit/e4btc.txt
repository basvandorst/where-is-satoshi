Strange, I noticed that the "settings" panel is completely gone and replaced by a useless coinmap.org copy.
I can't change my email address, email notifications, and other options.

Thanks for your feedback! All the products listed are in stock, as we've worked very hard to keep a "What you see is what you can get" experience. If anything should appear out of stock, it will be clearly marked and the item will be unable to be placed in your basket. We've been working hard on getting our prices to be as low as possible, as the prices for electronics fluctuate every day. 
The site is by no means "finished" adding features. All the price sorting features you were talking about are being worked on as we type. Searching products using different variables across different suppliers and inconsistent information is a long process, and we're adding more search functions as soon as it's tested and ready.
I appreciate your feedback and kind words.

You're right. I've modified the article so that the terminology is correct. Maybe I should simply call wallet services that are in control of your keys "super hot wallets"

Thanks for the input, for some reason the HD Wallet row was missing from the tl;dr table... it's in there now.

They are legit, anyway if you want to get a better price, original products directly from the manufacturer or directly ship from / to Europe..

Here's my comprehensive review of iPhone wallets
Some are left out because they weren't released at the time. Will be updating the review as soon as a few updates from other apps are pushed.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:20:42
Glad to hear you like the site! We established relationships with Europe's major suppliers for all the products you see. 
The price shows up for me, although there is only one left since my research.

Blockchain is a great iOS wallet, but there is no "winner" ... the review is detailed enough for anyone to choose the right wallet for themselves.
edit: and we didn't include the coinbase wallet due to the [controversy]( and [confusion]( surrounding the software. Pheeva is a decent  wallet for those interested in using an email address to "sign up" for a bitcoin wallet, but generally I wanted to stay away from hot wallets for the most part. Using an email address to get a btc address should not be the way to go about it.

Thanks for pointing that out. bitWallet is actually my personal favorite among all the wallets.
@_date: 2014-07-30 11:16:55
pm. thanks for reaching out and hope to see an updated version soon.

The Bitcoin core client is designed to help you use different addresses for every transaction. This is for your protection, as all transactions are published on the Blockchain.
You will still have access to the funds sent to old addresses in your Bitcoin core wallet.

We highly recommend  - European's number one electronic store. We ship more than 70.000 products e.g. Lenovo Thinkpads or Mac books for bitcoin only. The hardware is shipped directly (!) from the manufacturer with full garantuee and around-the-clock customer service. You wouldn't be the first customer from the UK, so far we shipped to almost every country in Europe. Checkout our shipping rates -  and best-of notebooks -
