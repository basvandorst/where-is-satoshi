If you think your smartphone is any less full of germs than a paper bill you are delusional.
Cash has many flaws, but this germophobe obsession is stupid, unless you are in the habit of licking your bills, or maybe snorting coke using them, and in that case I doubt the germs are the biggest health concern.

It intensifies every time the price drops. Some people can't handle it, sell all they had and turn into aggressive buttcoiners.
Then when the price turns up again, they go quiet and sullen. Until the next downturn, when they say "told ya so!" even though the price is now much higher, even at the bottom of the downturn, than it was when they first sold.

Math, Computer Science, Politics, Sociology, History, Law, Public Policy and a few more subjects  that I didn't think of off the top of my head, are all subjects entirely outside "economics" and which I would consider more crucial to understanding bitcoin than economics.
Not saying economics is irrelevant, it's absolutely an interesting and relevant angle, but it's very far from being at the core.

Exactly. And even more so if everyone important keep awarding your prizes and telling you how brilliant you are, and "This guy has really figured everything out!". Try being exposed to such a bubble of reverence for a few decades and your ability to handle new data that contradicts your beliefs  and most people would not be able to take new information in.

Traders have been shorting bitcoin because their TA charts and the zodiak tells them that the price will go down. Unfortunately dumb, but rich, people not as well versed in the fine prints of TA insist on buying bitcoin OTC, which eventually will force *someone* somewhere to run out of coins and in the end, buying will cause price rise. And then peope got short squeezed and stuff, and the price goes vertical for a bit.
Fully expecting traders to make another attempt at getting the price down, which may succeed for a while, but ultimately all those bearish signals don't mean jack shit if actual buyers keep trying to buy bitcoin with actual fat fiat piles.

The American definition of liberalism (what you call "modern liberalism") is really only just an American thing. In the rest of the world, most people associate liberalism with something close to classical liberalism (or social liberalism, which is essentially the same,just with a slightly more leftist slant, but never with the downright socialist/far left slant that it has in the US). 
In much of Europe, lefties call someone a "liberal" indicating that they think the person is too far to the right, too much in favor of free markets, and generally doesn't trust the state enough.

Your naivite about the EU imperial ambitions to control all of the continent in far more detail than the US is staggering. Believe you me, there is no room for bitcoin in the future the visions of Junker or Macron.  (Hence why France and Germany are the G20 countries pushing the hardest for stronger global regulations), 
Also, having lived and/or stayed extensively in various different parts of the EU, I can tell you there is no such thing as "EU mentality". Have you ever been to countries as different as Poland, Sweden, Austria, Ireland and Greece? If you had, you would never say anything so stupid as "EU mentality", because those countries could just as well exist on different continents. And many countries in the EU are far far more hostile to BTC than the US is. 
The US at least have a national notion that liberty and freedom is important. While this is to quite some extent an illusion, at least it is something people *want* to be true. In large areas of the EU no one give one fuck about freedom, because government taking care of everything is good enough for them. (Note that I am not saying this as an American, but as a "European" (using quotation marks because the very notion of a "European" is largely fiction)).

Because spending fiat when you could have spent bitcoin is clear a sign that you haven't bought enough bitcoin previously.

Craig pretends to give *technical* arguments. Roger is just spewing out his usual slimy politician soundbites. I'm assuming Vitalik sees it more of his domain to rebuke the technical stuff, and leaves the populist politician Roger for others to take care of.

But the only reason he is invited to these events and be a public figure at all is because of the lies and the fame that came with it. Without it, he is literally a nobody, and an ignoramus.
Which is pretty much what Vitalik is pointing out. CW is only there because of his celebrity status, and that is only derived from his fraud.

You should read it again. It doesn't say it's banned or that it's illegal to have an entry in the public ledger. It says regulated entities (banks, money services etc) are not allowed to provide crypto services. Not at all the same as what you are talking about.
Other than that, I agree with you on the shittyness of shitty governments in the aforementioned countries.

What absurdly ridiculous nonsense. Any type of lending does *not* result in this, only fractional reserve lending does. 
If I have a car, and let you borrow it for a while, does the car supply increase by 1 car while you have it?
If I have a hundred dollar bill and let you borrow it, does the money supply increase?
If I have a bitcoin and let you borrow it because you want to trade with it, does the bitcoin money supply increase?
Of bloody course not.
