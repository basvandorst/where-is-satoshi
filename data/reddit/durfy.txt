 nice work.. what are the implications of the Lightning Network or RSK for a tool like this I wonder.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:36:04
Such bitcoiners should find God.

So close to the promised land.

the last line says the managing director thinks GGC has "two or three btc wallets"
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:59:01
There are huge benefits to buying btc in that format that doesn't apply to buying btc out on the open market.

oh man, i might start drinking this watery concoction over this....
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:36:56
I wish I could gelp. We don't want Bitcoinlady getting taken down for money laundering, when all she was trying to do was help many people...

@_date: 2014-08-29 03:39:35
apparently they have "2 or 3" btc wallets.
@_date: 2014-09-07 04:23:29
At least someone in their debates in that town will be discussing real issues...
@_date: 2014-12-01 09:54:05
way to come clean about ur internet addiction.
@_date: 2014-08-29 04:16:09
i agree.

Any bitcoiners woulda likely been living in the clouds just above that plot of land.
@_date: 2014-10-14 05:58:10
it's not chill to say "deaf, dumb and blind." How old are you?
@_date: 2014-10-14 06:35:11
ha gotcha! f**k you f*ggot!
@_date: 2014-11-27 03:01:03
They'll probably buy the college with that BTC.
@_date: 2014-08-25 20:56:08
Why awesome?

@_date: 2014-09-09 05:37:30
these are just the bitcoiners who hang out on Reddit so discount them a bit. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:58:04
this must be part of their move to crypto only model.
@_date: 2016-01-03 21:26:49
crazy party out of country more likely.

@_date: 2016-11-27 00:04:01
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:05:49
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:03:23
I think bitcoin has potential to be useful for many things today it is not, including smart contracts. It has the developer talent. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:04:39
I think there is less BTC-BTCash going on then people think.

Sometimes this happens. Things get backed up. The dealer I've used before Veldt is backed up for instance and so are others. There are others also.  Bitcoin Commodities who doesn't appear to be delayed, GoldSilverBitcoin doesn't seem to be, etc. Also Schiff Gold, and some others like GoldSilver take BTC.

this site doesn't even accept Bitcoin, so they don't have much to gain at the moment other than providing info on bitcoin to non bitcoin users...

How does Tether keep you in Crypto world, isn't it another trusted 3rd party?
@_date: 2015-09-16 04:44:52
its going to be worth -$1,000,000
@_date: 2015-09-14 02:03:12
does the church actually accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-18 03:31:48
maybe bitcoin should charge similar to the banks.
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:57:00
is that really csw. How do we know?
@_date: 2015-11-23 22:23:21
not false...note the dreadful lack of investigating reporting in the space...that is because the people who hold BTC are holding for long-term investment and dgaf about growing the space really.
@_date: 2015-10-09 20:28:58
any others?
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:06:04
looks like $219 to sell bitcoin, $238 to buy 
@_date: 2015-02-04 04:14:23
Your site is about to be turned into scam central.

@_date: 2016-07-21 18:22:14

@_date: 2016-07-21 18:21:58

@_date: 2013-07-27 18:05:23

@_date: 2013-08-02 23:28:16

@_date: 2013-09-18 09:55:18
Glad to see Nakamoto saves us all again, at least.
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:26:54
I've been reading this thing and it's kinda entertaining and definitely technical in some parts... but in some parts not so.
@_date: 2013-07-31 06:26:49
Steven Pinker is a communist. I like his work though.
@_date: 2013-07-30 04:24:04
Definitely kinda cool.

Gold Silver Bitcoin buys metals, just email them or list on their P2P exchange. I listed some stuff there and it sold right away, but I got paid cash.
