A complete downturn for the worst is highly unlikely but a slow creep to hyperinflation seems to be the direction we are heading. Bitcoin is a great hedge against this among many other use cases.

Thanks a ton

Waxwing I know this is able to be found but I always get mixed info.  So the coins currently in a bitcoin address are called inputs, and outputs are the inputs that were grabbed from the address to make a new transaction?  Thus making them inputs in a new account.  Thanks so much I've just always needed an ELI5 on this

You were great on Let's Talk Bitcoin Erik.  Good luck.  I commend you for withdrawing from NY.  I may dabble with some alts in shapeshift because you seemed genuine

I knew Mike Hearn was a snake in the grass from very early on.  Gavin seems to have been bought.  I just don't trust Hearn though

Hearn fooling quite a lot of people from understanding that he was bought by the banks.  A lot of shilling in this thread also.  If you want bitcoin to be centralized then switch to XT and see how that works out for you.

do you even ECC?

Interesting.  I'm always skeptical of foul software though with any online poker or casino games.

This is probably what I would do except for 1 or 2 less transactions.  I would also consider mixing the coins thru monero on an alt exchange before sending the bitcoin to trezor

I like to buy a prepaid android phone and install mycellium on it via a microsd.  Disconnect wifi, data and network before.  Set uo new wallet and back up as normal.  Put pin on mycellium and phone home screen.  Bang you have a device thats never touched the internet that you can boot up anytime and connect to the internet and turn from cold wallet to hot wallet without having to sweep all the funds and that rigamarole.

I don't trust Gavin and Mike Hearn.  They are clearly against decentralization and the core tenets of bitcoin.  This will probably get deleted by the shill mods

Exactly the kind of comment I would expect of a shill.  No real counter, just namecalling

This guy is shilly mcshillington.  He basically influences plebes with his show and then has his buddies do the opposite.  It's a racket trust me.  Patrick Byrne will say the same thing

This is legit innovation in the botcoon space.  I see nothing here worthy of blind dislike.  Im excited for the project, Kim has shown to be a winner in life.  This also bring a lot of content creators into bitcoin
@_date: 2015-11-06 20:07:04
He's trying to stick it to the man with actual action.  More than most of us keyboard warriors can say.  But by all means continue being plebes and let the NSA spy on everything you do

Ad hominem attack with no argument to back his point up.  Someone is bitter and realizes ETC will win out

Shills are easily spotted compared to someone just being contrarian.  As long as people know that people like Seaman and Amanda Johnson are out there, it's a positive.  They're awareness of shills in many aspects of the Internet will help you greatly.  Those 2 will fade away because they don't really offer anything meaningful.  But others will take their place I'm the bitcoin FUD brigade
