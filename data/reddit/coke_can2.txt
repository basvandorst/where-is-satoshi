The trading bots are probably watching for this meme and use it as a trigger to sell lol. If I had time to day trade, I definitely would...
@_date: 2018-09-27 02:13:24
It worked out better for me. If I went all-in when I started buying bitcoin, I would have a fraction of the btc I have now. Instead, my average $/BTC is very close to the current price, even though I started when it was well over double the current price.
I spend the same every week, but when the price is high, I'm not buying much. When it's low, I'm getting a lot. Yay math! 
@_date: 2018-09-08 15:50:05
That's why I was being overly sarcastic
@_date: 2018-09-08 15:01:05
The exchange could be hacked, vanish tomorrow, or just close/lock your account, and your btc is gone.
On your own wallet, you memorize the 12 words, and no matter what you always have access to your btc.
Edit: oh guess I can't read. Oh well, it stays... 
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:31:24
No, I think they just have a service where you can buy bitcoin. They're using that to see if there's a market for transacting in bitcoin.

Clarification because I had to spend a lot of time educating a couple bankers about this: unless it's part of another entity such as a personal business, 250k is only per person per bank. 
You can't just open another personal account at the same bank for more coverage. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:42:29
I was just playing with the idea of opening a btc store too. Could someone please explain why spend $50/month instead of using BlockChain.info for free?
BlockChain feels like the most direct payment possible just take the xpub from any wallet that supplies it, and give a customer an address to pay, and done. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:50:27
I figure most people under 30 haven't had significant money in a savings ace prior to interest rates hitting 0%.
For us, it's just a place our money goes to inflate.
Not taking out a significant loan directly with a bank might be a factor too. If not, a bank just seems to be a necessary evil of fiat, and don't realize the value of credit. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:49:55
The credit card one is interesting. Does he think if the company as his friend he wants to avoid upsetting? Does he feel bad for not giving them money because he thinks they need it more than him? Or does he just enjoy paying interest?

@_date: 2018-05-12 00:29:35
I too vote for not loaning your bitcoin to someone you don't know interest free.
Here's the technical info you need to keep your own bitcoin:
1)Store parts of your seed in multiple places where no 2 people that know eachother can find parts it and assemble the whole seed. They should be distributed so all parts of the seed can't be destroyed at the same time (natural desasters like tornado and flood = not same city) 
2)dont send your bitcoin to any address unless you're 100% sure it's the right one. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:47:05

Because if there's unlimited supply, there will be no demand...
Think of it like diamonds. Debeers isn't limiting supply for the fun of it. 
What if they really did run out of diamonds, and it couldn't be simulated in a lab? What if all the diamonds in the world are now owned by people? The price would skyrocket.
What if there's virtually limitless supply in vaults, and can be easily made in a lab? They'd be virtually worthless, except to suckers- as they are now, and as bitcoin would be.

... Same thing that happens if you give cash to the wrong person. It's gone. Why is that such a big issue, how could it possibly be better?
If there were a way to take it back, the transaction wouldn't mean anything. Nobody would accept your payment because it's not trust less, they're trusting you to not take their money back.

Bitcoin probably won't replace paper money. It's benefit is that it's the one thing that literally can't be shut down or taken from you. If you generate and store your keys in a safe manner, then the money in your account can never be taken, or stopped from being sent to who you choose.
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:49:26
Also you can often get a discount for not using a credit card in some places.
It's like buying on eBay or Amazon thinking you're not paying eBay sellers and shipping fees. You're paying them, it's just not itemized. The seller is hiding it in the price because people are stupid and think it doesn't exist if they can't see it even though the consumer often ends up paying more. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 05:30:47
So just one bullet then. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:35:18
Bitcoin = cash. If you offer bitcoin to someone selling online that can accept it, I'd bet most would offer a discount. I certainly would. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:17:49
Yep. I would say it's a good time to start small and just buy more btc to increase capacity, but like you said, banks suck so I can't easily accept their fiat. 
And there's the huge problem with fiat: impossible to accept directly online :(

Thanks for your perspective. I've been playing with the idea of opening an eBay store to sell some of my 3d printed designs, but dealing with all that crap doesn't sound worth it anymore.
Instead I can take bitcoin so I can't be robbed by buyers, and build a reputation with low price parts. If I rip people off, it won't be hard for potential customers to hear about it.
It's a much more practical solution than sellers somehow vetting every buyer if they were given chargeback ability in bitcoin lol.

@_date: 2019-08-15 01:32:39
I'm no mathematician, but I believe 18-&gt;6 is a 66% drop, not 200%.
18 to 0 is 100% drop. Then I extrapolated as a joke to -18 for "200% loss".
I was using 10k, but the point stands. Numbers mean things, and when you misuse them, it's obvious and sometimes entertaining.
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:42:36

@_date: 2019-10-31 01:09:57
They already do, if you've ever used a credit card. Merchant pays something like 3-5%, which is hidden in the cost of the good or service.
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:28:27
No worries, you have a lot more btc now by dca than you would of you went all in at 20k for sure! By my math, your effective buy-in should be around 8k or 9k if you started around all the crazyness. So dca probably doubled your current value vs someone who panicked and went all in back then.. 
That also means if you were forced to sell out now, you'd lose a lot less than otherwise as well.
Yay math!

@_date: 2019-06-28 12:31:07
That advice might work for stocks, but I would be surprised if there's research that says it would apply to something as volatile as btc.
The vast majority of people are going to hear about it while it's high, and fomo in.
My anecdata: started buying at 14k around the last ath. Because I dca'd, I have well over twice the amount of bitcoin than I would if I followed your advice.
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:51:50

@_date: 2019-06-04 01:51:41
I think the common expectation is that bitcoin will either take off as store of value when markets finally crash, or at worst gold stay. Then move the gains into stock market to hitch a ride on the recovery when recession / depression is over.

Thought I could make the layers out as well though.
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:45:41
Consider this: chance of bitcoin price doubling it pretty high, right? If you want a half a bitcoin, why not buy one, then sell half when the price doubles. Then you have half a bitcoin for free :)
@_date: 2019-02-08 03:27:12
Yeah, it's got a long time to go for that too be practical. Way too heavy, hot, and low resolution for that right now :(
Can't wait though, I could go to work in a little closet all day with a mouse, keyboard, and headset, and not care one bit. 
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:43:57
Because it's easier and more secure than sending private keys, and the fee is negligible.

I actually did have an old hdd die on me a couple months ago. I'll just give that to anyone who wants my btc. Or maybe the waterlogged phone with unrecoverable encrypted memory (s7) from my last vacation..

Lost that years ago in a boating accident.
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:53:32
People just don't realize the benefit of it. In traditional stocks, it might not be best because they generally trend upwards. Bitcoin is extremely volatile though, and generally only give significant gains a few days per year. They're trying to apply traditional stock advice to bitcoin.
Anyone claiming to be "good enough at bitcoin to not DCA" is fooling themselves into thinking they can time the market, or don't realize how seldomly it moves upward. 
In my opinion, anyway. I'm no expert, but the scenarios I've seen and experienced, have held true.

@_date: 2019-06-23 16:57:09
Guess I didn't realize this was an issue because I've only ever used coinbase pro.
I know, I know, everyone here hates them because those customer service sucks, so just don't put or leave more than you're willing to lose on it, but that should apply to literally any exchange anyway.
Takes about 4 business days for the fiat to get from bank to coinbase, but I've never had them prevent the immediate btc withdraw to my private wallets.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:14:15
What happened?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:55:42
This is where I'm at. With BTC at 1M, return from stocks would make me comfortable. Long way to get there though.   
Guess I'll continue the dollar cost average buys, and when my BTC count doubles (which isn't much in the grand scheme of things), we only have to hit 0.5M. Still might be a long shot though :/
@_date: 2019-06-13 03:07:03
But because you're dca'ing, you're buying a lot more at the bottoms than at the tops. Has worked out beautifully for me anyway.
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:05:12
I see what you did there ;)
@_date: 2019-06-14 02:35:02
Neither the problem, nor primary function of banks is their ability to hold cash like a wallet.
And if you're smart enough to hold bitcoins in a wallet you actually control, it's not like a bank at all because they don't even hold your money, you're just using it to change cash to bitcoin, making it an exchange.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:22:18
Not sure I understand exactly what percentage you're asking for, but on [pro.coinbase]( (same login), I'm finding an option under "My Orders" to "download statement". Select .csv format, and excel would probably be able to open it, and do the calculations you want. I just keep my own sheet of buy date, dollars and btc to track it myself though.

That's only a problem if you're not dollar cost averaging.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:18:44
This. Because I was dca'ing, I bought twice as much btc at 3k than I did at 6k. Was buying 3x more than weeks when it's at 9k, etc. The effect on my average buy price was crazy.

What? We're not talking about credit. We're talking about buyer protection: you order something on eBay, and they don't deliver.
Banks can do a charge back in this case, and eat the cost. If there were a middle man or escrow account of some sort, buyers using bitcoin could be similarly protected.

It is free minus hardware, and not that difficult for people familiar with both bitcoin and raspberry pi, but that's not many people. 
I'm running 2  3d printers remotely using a single pi, and just yesterday made a change to my printers firmware, but most people lose interest when a terminal or compiler get involved. 
There needs to be an image you can write to the SD card, boot, and follow basic prompts to set it up without touching the terminal.
Then you'll reach a much larger audience.

@_date: 2018-11-12 15:20:35
Hopefully it's just a matter of time then. The stores are paying about that much to Visa each time you swipe a credit card, so if they move to Bitcoin, hopefully they can send some of that savings to the customer. Last year I bought about 5K worth of sod from a local store. That's about how much they gave me for paying cash instead of using a card as well.

Iirc my buy went through instantly last Monday? The cash takes a week to get into the coinbase account, but as soon as my maker buy order was filled, the btc showed up in the coinbase walled immediately. Then hit withdraw, btc, receive address, 2-factor code, and could see it waiting block chain confirmations by the time I got done with the entry in my own records.. 
Are you doing something differently? 
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:51:44
It's basically voting with cash. To vote yes, send btc to address "...ABC...", To vote no, send btc to address "...XYZ...".
Could be an effective way to act based on the will of the most wealthy party, but idk how often that is ideal though, outside of extortion.

That's clearly impractical and the wrong approach. The only way would be to make a quantum computer capable of brute forcing everybody's keys, so that the coins can be taken. That's the only way to get the lost coins.   
It's also the only way to do it and be profitable. Assuming of course that if you're smart enough to crack any key, that you're also smart enough to not tell anyone, and use it only in cases where it won't be discovered...

First of all, he didn't offer lump sum as an alternative option- only investing a fixed amount over time (probably out of a paycheck or other scheduled income). From what I've seen, DCA is pretty much always better than fixed amount (or whatever that's even called) buying.
  
Finally, the data I heard for lump sum vs DCA was something like \~2-3% higher performance from lump sum vs dollar cost averaging in \~70% of cases. If DCA removes the chance of an emotional decision like FOMO, I'd call it easily worth that small of a potential loss, to prevent someone buying in at $20K. 
Since I started buying, my average $/BTC is less than half what it would be if I lump summed what I've DCA'd so far, and decreases every time I buy. As a result, I'm happy if it stays low because I can continue to buy in and lower that margin significantly more than his method. If the price goes over my current $/BTC average and I continue to buy, I'm not raising my $/BTC average nearly as much as if I was buying a fixed amount of BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:04:18
Dollar cost averaging is the mathematically smart way to go. You can set your amount where it'll be roughly 0.1BTC, but buying a set amount will put you at a financial disadvantage.   
Go for something like $360/month. When the BTC price is low, you're getting more BTC/dollar. When the price is high, you're not buying in high as badly. There should be plenty of youtube videos or websites explaining it better if you like to not waste money :)

Keep the seed for your wallets in safety deposit box so your wallet can be restored from new hardware if destroyed. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 03:21:46
Eh, I prefer it isn't waterproof. If I lose it, I can easily get back into the account with the seed, which has pieces in various places. If someone finds it, maybe I'll get lucky and it'll have been destroyed since being lost. 
Carrying around a hardware wallet seems counter productive anyway. 
If you need liquid funds for a buy, why not use a software wallet on your waterproof phone, or do it from home with the hardware.

My understanding is that it's not possible because your single seed was already generated. It's not possible to do it properly, because that seed exists- you would be just tricking yourself into thinking it's secure, but at the end of the day, that wallet will always have that vulnerability of your single seed.
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:08:44
Yeah it defeats one of the primary features (in my opinion) of bitcoin. It's just like cash. You accidentally throw it away, or give it to the wrong person, or let it get stolen? It's gone. You pay someone, and it's final.
There's no mommy and daddy to run to to get your cash back. Treat it with due care, or suffer the consequences just like everybody else.
Also, if you send money to someone with the option to pull it back, you didn't actually send it. It's an illusion that makes people happy, but it's not your money until it's in your hand. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:12:57
Except they're not really buying bitcoin. It can never be used except turning it back into cash. If you don't have the private key, and can't send it wherever you want, it's not really yours.

Splitting it up is a good idea I think. What I did was divided the 24 word key into thirds. Write down 2 groups of words on 3 separate pages, making sure none have all the same words.
Now if one is destroyed, you can recreate it using the other two. Just make sure they're distributed so 2 won't likely be destroyed together (tornado, wild fires, flooding, etc could knock out nearby houses/offices at the same time) . Also if letting friends/family hold one, make sure they don't know each other.

No, you own bitcoin because it can't be stolen. It's the only thing you own that nobody can ever take from you, and you can never lose unless you suffer brain damage. Even then it should be hidden or encoded somewhere you could recover it but nobody else could. 
That's why you don't tell anyone how much you have and use multiple passphrases on the wallet -they could torture you until you give it all up.
There are cryptocurrencies that are untraceable, but besides anonymous donations, it's pretty hard to spend without revealing your identity if someone really wanted it anyway.

Who would care if it even stamped all the way through? If someone has enough access to see the back side, they probably have enough access to open and read the whole thing.
My trezor may be plastic, but I memorized the key, so doesn't matter if it's destroyed, and saved the key on a way where no group of people could find enough parts to assemble it without me knowing, but my wife would if I died. It also doesn't give up my private key if someone steals the actual wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:38:31
Are you saying that in Spain, if you're terminated for not showing up, they magically don't owe you money for the time you did show up?
I mean, my company will assume you've resigned after just a couple days of not showing up or notifying your manager. That doesn't excuse them paying for the time you did work though. That being said, if they haven't paid you for months, you're probably not going to get paid no matter how you quit or leave your job. If someone works for months without pay, that's their own fault in my opinion. In the USA we call it "volunteer work".
First missed paycheck = job hunt begins. Company has serious financial problems, so even if it does show late, that's a huge red flag.

You think I'm going to hire them to pen test my building or website now? No, they'll probably hide one of their findings for their own use or to sell on black market lol. No thanks..
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:15:55
Don't buy emotionally. Do yourself a favor and dollar cost average in. Pick a time you want to be invested by and how often you want to buy (I do weekly). So say you have 30k to spend, and be invested in 30 weeks? Spend 1k/week.
It saved me a lot of money, anyway. A lot of redditors don't like that approach for some reason, but the numbers I've ran and examples I've seen, it virtually always works out better in a volatile market like this.
Though others have said already , it bears repeating: get a hardware wallet. I use trezor model t. It works very well, but make sure to both memorize your private key, and store it in a way that only you can find and decode it in case of memory loss.

Yeah, just meant it in general. I Googled it real quick earlier and saw a post titled something like "trezor isn't as open source as you might think", and it reminded me that things can change, and people (including myself) could just be wrong/confused sometimes, so hopefully you wouldn't buy a trezor thinking you could do something you can't, for example :)
