Thanks for your input so far.  :)
Do you mean $500 in hardware/software to accept bitcoin (if so, what are these items)?  Or $500 in time?

I like that idea about absorbing his risk until he gets on his feet, as it were.
That's what my original thought had been regarding the possibility of someone scamming him if he doesn't make them wait the 10 mins for confirmation.  Like, I would tell him that I'll cover any losses, since I wouldn't expect them to be significant.
So, onto hard startup costs: is there any hardware to buy?  And is Mycelium free or is there a cost for that?
Thanks. :)

This is what I'm really wondering.
I don't want to even approach the guy about it if there isn't a net upside to the effort.

Perhaps I worded that incorrectly.  I meant to get across that I don't want the guy's eyes to glaze over by going too far into details about how bitcoin transactions work (vis-a-vis confirmation times).  So, if he doesn't mind taking on the (low, in my opinion) risk of someone trying to screw him out of $2, then he won't have to make anyone wait 10 minutes for the confirmation to go through.
But, go ahead, be a dick about my request for information.

Thanks for the input.  I'll check out those wallets on my iphone and android devices before going in, like you suggest.


Eh, I've been going there for the past 5 years casually and he and I get along great.  If I go in in a "salesman's suit," it would feel weird.  But I get where you're coming from. :)
