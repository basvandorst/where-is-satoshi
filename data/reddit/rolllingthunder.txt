Not claiming any expertise here, but if Bitcoin behaves like other commodities (gold/silver specifically here) then there is a high likelihood of people dumping money into it to offset inflation.

My question would be are there enough reliable crypto coins that you could diversify market responses with some less volatile ones? The investors obviously could give 0 shits about the coins or technology, so long as a portfolio could capture +/-10% annual with better risk than other notable assets (pennystock, junk bonds, etc).

Just sell it to another wallet that you own at a loss.
Big brain time.

RADICAL SHIFTS OF THOUSANDS OF CENTS. MORE NEWS AT 11.

 I'm feeling it is a good deal given how the hype is starting back up in mainstream media.

All those bears return to their cave? 
TL;Dr thought I was crazy buying more yesterday, immediately up from the total route of Monday/Tues. Riding those 1.5 coins to the top bby.

I thought I was stupid for jumping ship at 8.5k a few weeks ago, because I only made $50. Now I'm sitting here looking back at traditional investment vehicles. At least PC builds will cool down!

I'm in a good spot if it hits 9k. I'm just debating how long to sit. Don't want to FOMO my way right back down the coaster.

The sudden charge to 7900.

If that were the case, btc is just acting like precious metals. The value doesn't inherently change, it just adjusts for a drop in the purchasing power of your currency. Also, calling a potential tradewar market collapse is getting ahead of ourselves.

You're naming the 3 tech companies who had massive problems in the past two weeks. Using them as the focal point for the market as a whole instead of seeing they are the exception is your call, but I wouldn't recommend it.
