Not just post dates cheques there is also Bitcoin type payment system in India called Aangdia payments, they can transfer loads of money at very cheap rates but mind you it's illegal. Any party interested and trusted by Aangdia gives them a Address just like Bitcoin address but are simple and unique, lets say I have my named 'Lollipop' and I want to transfer money to someone anywhere, I ask them their Aangadia payment address, lets say 'Guru', I call from my phone to this Aangadia and ask them to transfer to 'Guru' amount 100,000 and they confirm, and next day 'Guru' has to call Aangadia and confirm that  whether 'Guru' has received money from 'Lollipop' with the exact figure and if they say "confirm" its done. Even if I don't have a account I can directly transfer amounts lets say I have to receive money from 'Samsung' ( These are all actual Aandia payment address) I can directly give 'Samsung' address of whom I want to pay, lets say 'Guru', now 'Samsung' has to ask me to confirm and I ask 'Guru' to confirm if 'Guru' gets a confirmation from Aangadia they confirm it back to me I confirm it to 'Samsung'. It's a age old system way older than Bitcoin. But it works and its very illegal. The charges are only when you want cash.Right now If I want cash from Aangdia they charge me 0.80% that's 800 Bucks for 100,000 the rates changes and is market derived but its usually 0.60 to 0.80% of total amount.

Bitlicense actually do have a intention to know the customer as bitcoin transaction can be very annon they need it curb the illegal use of it, but that information could be used for other purpose too. For info India too requires bitcoin business to gather KYC. I don't think bitlicense is viable.

How would they spy them, they just want the transactions to be linked to a KYC just like a  Invoice.

Well with that much computing power it would be more easy to mine bitcoin than find one.

Technically you can, and if everyone started doing it both exchange will level out.

Twist: What if the buyer and seller are the same and doing it to transfer that bitcoins without paying too much brokerage.

Private keys are not stored on internet, you can even generate an address (public key) and its private key offline without internet, printing it,writing down, covert to QR code and print that private key on a piece of paper is your paper wallet, if you remember it with case sensitivity you can call it brain wallet but its highly impossible, you delete any trace of the generated private key from the system is your security. Now you can give your address (public key) to anyone to receive bitcoins, even though you have crated it offline it will be a unique one, lets say you bought some coins and you want to spend it, that is when you will need that piece of paper where you wrote down the private key (aka paper wallet), you will have to provide the client (which ever software you use to send bitcoins) with exact address and its private key the client can only then transact that address to send bitcoins, the client stores those keys in wallet.dat file, you can delete or digitally shred that wallet file to be safe because you have your paper wallet. 
Edit: you can use vanitygen to create unique address with personal touch like starting with 1DCox.

And also tell her you are gonna keep some bitcoins so that you are gonna have wonderful life when you grow old.

Scam 
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:25:09
Not just first but first 160 to be precise i think. And the the bitcoin generated creating a block is a transaction in itself.
