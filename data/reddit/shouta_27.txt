Bitcoin could stand to gain more of this type of thing and hopefully we get more government and their staffers to use Bitcoin and give us good publicity.

Now we have a way more scenarios for tap tap tap
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:29:58
Well... what can I say? Not enough costs are counted here. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:20:15
No it's not. You can get closer to the Moon by using it. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:34:49
It's not a nice wordplay dude
@_date: 2014-09-06 08:29:46
Phrasing!

If there was a dog, i'd type something like "Wow such bioshok" or "so man paintings"
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:18:24
I'm not sure that you can call this plane a "force". 
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:00:25
Hired to do what? 
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:00:41
We can call it "Bitcoin logic"
@_date: 2014-09-06 08:22:14
The name of the topic makes me aftaid but not the content. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:20:13
As high as famous f-word.
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:57:08
Green light is a good sign even if we are talking about shop in Mexico. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 13:31:39
Literally or actually? 
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:00:15
Should we create our own religion? 
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:36:54
What strategy do you prefer? Long-term? 
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:36:32
You. Get. A dump.
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:21:11
What does the Chancellor of the Exchequer doo? Chancellor of Exchange is what that stands for? Either way, it is very helpful when people who are in the spotlight or government do these types of things. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 13:32:34
That's what we are waiting for! 
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:29:59
Exactly. But who cares  about labor? 
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:30:02
Extra security? What do you mean? A guy with a gun? Lol
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:56:33


Awkward. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 16:37:34


Maybe since now i will use NFC in my mobile phone? 
@_date: 2014-09-07 16:33:24
Yeah, it's very excellent and profitable. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:51:06


Fakes! Fakes are everywhere! 
@_date: 2014-09-06 08:36:22


Something went wrong. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:51:06
What is 7-eleven? Some kind of a shopping moll? 
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:29:55
Looking for an example too. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:41:01
In my opinion, 110 is not normal.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:36:44
That's because it looks like a real life =(
@_date: 2014-09-06 08:23:14


What does it mean? "Tied to its ability"? What?  
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:19:30

For sure. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:19:46
Upvoted! 
@_date: 2014-09-28 13:33:03
No it's not. It can't ruin BTC if people are about to use it. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:36:53


Why should it include the 10.10 beta? 
@_date: 2014-09-18 12:39:09
trying times with some nice rhymes or whatever
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:19:10
I need a guy who will clear my memory
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:50:49


But some crazy Bitcoin fans love it. Sad but true. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 16:37:37
It's excellent because it about Bitcoin or because it contain a cool content? 
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:58:00


C'mon dude! It's about tapping! 
@_date: 2014-09-06 08:30:13
It's look a way more Bioishock, not a fallout. But i still love it.
@_date: 2014-09-06 08:38:29
Every time i hear Silk Road i imagine a Battlefield 4 map, not a something connected with Bitcoins lol 
@_date: 2014-09-28 13:32:22
Why not? 
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:52:40
Now I have an extra reason to travel to DC. 
@_date: 2014-09-06 08:34:10


People do it. But the fact that they give their own attention won't change the situation. I know it's sounds sad but it's true. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:09:30
Could have chosen a better tune though!
@_date: 2014-09-28 13:30:55


Agreed. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:29:53
How about a kick some flow? 
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:20:03

@_date: 2014-09-21 15:18:45
Can this can send me to the Moon? 
@_date: 2014-09-28 13:30:32
To the Moon! 
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:57:08
Slow it down. They need to take some small steps to taste the power of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 16:37:05
I'm sick of "Coinbase news" for today. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:17:52


Yes, it is.
@_date: 2014-09-28 13:30:46
What does it mean "poor quality"? 
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:57:27
We love you, Jon Stewart!
