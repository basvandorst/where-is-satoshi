the former, but interestingly enough they're well within an order of magnitude of each other

That's totally understandable. I see the potential benefits of bitcoin as being largely shared by everyone who uses it because of it's inherent fairness and efficiency (I know this is 100% debatable, but like you said, dream big.) Thanks for being open-minded.

as a subscriber to both bitcoin and trees, this made me smile

He's totally entitled to his opinion, and I'm not saying this invalidates it, but imho the writing is pretty bad.
"Bitcoin has become synonymous with everything wrong with Silicon Valley: a marriage of *dubious* technology and *questionable* economics wrapped up in a *crypto-libertarian political* agenda that smacks of *nerds-do-it-better* paternalism. With its influx of *finance* mercenaries, the Bitcoin community is a *grim* illustration of greed running roughshod over *meaningful* progress.
(You can remove every adjective and take nothing of value away from the point he's trying to make. The addiction spans most of the article. Roughshod's a pretty cool pretentious word, though.)
edit: on second thought, "crypto-libertarian" does add a bit of context if you have no idea what bitcoin is.

cooky privacy advocate in me says it doesn't record where you were for exactly how long (not directly tied to your name, anyway)

heh, this is the type of thing we should try to avoid...

just the look on the female host's face when she says "see, there you go, here's a real person and they say it doesn't matter." (which, by the way, is just eloquence distilled...) kills me a little inside.

the trust verification fee would be wonderful. hell, some kind of refund after a time period/repeat exchange might work well too. It's a shame there's no clever way for fraud to be ruled out entirely...
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:33:45
thanks, this is actually really interesting, never broke it down like that before.

yeah, it'd either be that or the classic image of a random binary sequence... i don't know which i dislike more.

"huge douchebag" is a bit of a stretch... how hard is it to do the half hour of research needed to learn the basics? I didn't do the paper wallet thing because I agree, it's confusing for a first timer, but I'm letting the recipient know first and foremost that they can turn it into a giftcard almost instantly, or actually buy something with it directly. There's over 30k companies that accept it, and that's just between bitpay and coinbase payment services. Was this mentioned?
Also, if I got a gift of, say, a western union transfer (which I've never used, seen, or know much about using) I wouldn't bitch about it, I'd be happy I got a gift at all, let alone free *money*. I agree with your sentiment but I would also keep in mind that your brother probably believes that he's found something really cool, that he wants to share with his family. If not - if he's truly treating this like the pyramid/ponzi scheme so many like to say it is - than yeah, he's a dick. Sorry if it ruined your christmas...
edit: english is hard.

...but he's still going to treat it like one, to the bitter end it seems.

the only thing is that the queue  for each round would have to be fairly large, or limit trades to once an hour per person... otherwise, it could be flooded by bots and *completely* drive the price

Nice parallelism, is it practical to disregard the differences in the scale of time though?

*(no sass intended)* what would the payment system for cash be? And likewise, what monetary value is represented by the transferment of bitcoin? It comes off to me as a semantics issue of the protocol vs. the objects (in a programming sense) it manages, which is understandable but somewhat arbitrary.
