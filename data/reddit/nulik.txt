I know that the difficulty can be dynamically adjusted, I recall, I read the specification. But there is still an error in this system. If miners quit quickly , so quickly that there is no computing power to generate a new block (to lower the difficulty), the system will enter a suspended state, where no one could restart it until there is enough computing power to create a new block

you forget that miners are now using multipools. If a mulltipool owner decides to step out, all those miners will be disconnected. And this can happen without a warning. Specially at the time when halving occurs with an additional price drop. We don't have to wait for such thing, you may orchestrate it, just attack multipool servers with a DDOS and you have got it, Bitcoin will collapse.

no. I read the specification of blockchain

I don't know why, but if you have the door open, somebody might get in to the house and you can't know why he is going to do it and when. I am not saying that this scenario is a sure crash for Bitcoin, I just gave an example how Bitcoin can collapse, and my scenario is possible to occur.

for my scenario of Bitcoin failure to take place, a rapid disappearance of miners must occur within 10 minutes. This will not be easy to do for Ethereum for example, because in Ethereum every block is created in 15 seconds.

if the price drops suddenly and miners quit mining quickly, there will be no computing hardware to create a new block, the system will become unusable. I agree that  if there are few miners, reward will be higher, but if the system becomes unusable, nothing will help the price.

"price" will increase because of deflationary nature of currency design. again, we are not talking about day to day operations.

Miners might continue to mine, yes. But lets consider we have a very very high difficulty. A sudden sharp drop in the amount of miners within 10 minutes may not allow to quickly recalculate difficulty. They are badly managed and they delay to respond to any news event, so they keep mining. In one week they will get the block and readjust the difficulty. But the trust in the system have been affected. Bitcoin's price will be punished. Other coins will emerge to fix this failure, which will lead to diminishing in the use of Bitcoin and that's how the currency will go to 0 eventually. Remember that Satoshi said that Bitcoin is an experiment, not something to relay on for serious operation.

Lets consider this: hackers attack Bitcoin multipools with a DDOS. The system becomes unusable for 3 days. Bitcoin's price falls 50%, miners will see that and start mining another coin, this can happen in a day or two. When DDOS attack is managed and the system is restored there are no players within the system and new block is not generated. The system entered an unrecoverable state. The internet is working, everything is working, other currencies are being mined, but Bitcoin has collapsed. It has collapsed because nobody wants to mine it anymore but hey, those who want to mine it do not reach enough computing power to readjust the difficulty. And beleieve me, 1 week without being able to send or receive is a HUGE hole within the system design. Such currency could not be used seriously, the governments will be happy for such thing, they actually may pay to orchestrate such attack, they probable already ready to do it, they are just waiting for the conditions, they are waiting for the price and difficulty to go high enough

"mempool will grow": we are not talking about day to day fluctuations, we are talking about _sudden_ withdrawal of computing power to create new block.

the difficulty adapts every 2016th block. That means 2016*10=20160 minutes. Or  14 days. 14 days is a lot of time not being able to withdraw any money, my scenario for bitcoin collapse is very real.
