SEC and CFTC are considering approval of Bitcoin securities trading.  This is essentially a stamp of approval from the United States federal govt.
SEC approval of Bitcoin ETFs would open the floodgates of the NYSE into the Bitcoin market, providing regulated, legitimated avenues for traditional investors, from hedge funds and mutual funds to individuals with a 401k to move into bitcoin.
If you have followed the SEC consideration of the Winkelvoss Bitcoin ETF, you'll know that the SEC's primary concern about bitcoin is that many of the popular bitcoin exchanges are unregulated and overseas (bitfinex and polo are china, etc).  Historical events, for example Mt Gox, have demonstrated that unregulated exchanges represent a threat to markets.  Recent closure announcements of overseas exchanges, particularly bitfinex (RIP) indicate that the SEC is currently evaluating and approving domestic exchanges; this indicates that they are moving towards approval of the bitcoin marketplace, and will soon approve NYSE money moving into bitcoin markets.
This is huge.  A 1% movement from the NYSE into the bitcoin market would exponentially increase bitcoin's marketcap. 
For this reason (and many others) I don't understand fearful pessimists who think the Feds are gonna steal everyone's bitcoin.

Robinhood is primarily for stocks, but it has crypto, I think they offer 7 options, but basically btc eth and ltc plus forks
Robinhood is free, no fees for trades, it’s a safe platform, easy to use, no minimums (I think).
Only drawback on robinhood (I think) is that you can’t transfer crypto off the platform
