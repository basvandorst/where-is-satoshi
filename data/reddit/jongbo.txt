Was Thinking along the lines of a Bot to fight the Bots.
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:11:10
The only why to beat it seems is with a faster ALGO.
News bot seems lucrative

I Know the Markets there are Unregulated but WOW
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:30:08
they say you have to email them to activate it,is that a possibility?
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:07:02
Thats what i thought,unless there "colored coins" which are denominations of BTC anyways.
- Virtacoin claims to work like bitcoin with interchangeable wallets.
VirtaCoin addresses are similar to Bitcoin addresses and can be used to send and receive Bitcoins as well. You can also send VirtaCoins to a Bitcoin address and Bitcoins to a VirtaCoin address. A single VirtaCoin or Bitcoin address can as well be used to separately manage balances of both cryptocurrencies. VirtaCoin is the first and only scrypt-based coin to do all this.
- i was guessing it didnt work since i sent 1ksat that seems to have disappeared

Crypto ones Wouldnt as bad as stock market though would they?
Considering they Couldnt really Work of News as Precise and would still need User Inputs.

I know Right! 
The Difficulty's nearly Doubled since The Start of  December.
No Effect on Price it Seems.

unsure about exchange mechanism.
i ask because a developer for Virtacoin said there wallets accept transfers of Bitcoin but i tried myself and didnt work.
Would one have to setup this exchange themselves or would it be built into wallet?
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:19:41
my understanding of how bitcoin works,cant send a transaction to a wallet that  doesnt exist,so where would my btc be?
@_date: 2016-01-01 11:42:46
well find out at 4PM i think thats midnight in china.
Dont know how finances work there but assume they could just wire to exchange. 
Surprising how the margins have shortened between the Chinese and US markets.
considering the rise in volume price seems largely unaffected.
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:32:48
Too True.
Is there a Way to Make an Anti-trading Bot ? 
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:30:38
Is there anyway for an Exchange to know if its bots or not?
Chinese Volume could be more legimate considering they have nearly 28% of the worlds **Broad** Money.
With them Loosening Capital Controls and halting some Major Foerign Currency Exchanges.
The average Chinese person who is looking to protect their assets  could be becoming traders just because of recent trends and with USD bearish BTC would be best choice.
Just a theory baased on recent develepments

Can virtacoin heads/devs help @_date: 2016-01-15 18:23:59
The guys from VTA claim i did it wrong thats why didnt work but my btc is gone nothing in VTA wallet.
--heres there site 
@_date: 2016-01-02 16:26:11
Its not as Bad as the New Spin of The Big Corporations getting 0% Loans!!
Not to Mention the Stock Slowdown Facilities. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 17:43:14
Seems like News doesn't effect BTC as much as say Stock Related News does.
For example the Interest *Hike* by the Fed and Chinese Capital Measures
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:37:36
But how can they know if there bots or not? 
Isn't the stock market like 90% controlled by bots?
@_date: 2016-01-02 16:15:16
Is there Anyway to Find Out? 
Or is it on the assumption that Because They don't Charge Commission its In-house Bots?
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:11:55
Can any of the heads/devs weigh in  
@_date: 2016-01-02 14:55:26
Dont know where They get there Figures just Checked Bottom of 
 Charts

@_date: 2016-02-16 22:12:48
dont know what he did wont explain properly i think its a clone to transfer and give less amount not sure.
tried it myself btc just dissapered nothing showed up in VTA wallet and i know its not possible for a transaction to move to nonexistent wallet.
heres only explanation he gives 
@_date: 2016-02-16 22:04:22
a developer for Virtacoin claims to have made a BTC/VTA converter that turns Bitcoin into Virtacoin automatically with importing private keys so you can send BTC to VTA wallet with transaction
@_date: 2016-02-16 22:38:02
i think its direct clone of BTC core with value being divisible by amount of BTC so they pay 3 to 1 but actual value is 2.7sat i think
heres their site explaining difference between BTC/VTA
@_date: 2016-02-16 22:31:24
he created convertor and claims that conversion happens by importing key at a rate of 3 to 1 i didnt think it  was possible and tried myself thats why asked here
@_date: 2016-02-16 22:26:15
hes a Dev for VTA
