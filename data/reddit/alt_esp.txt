To use the language of OWS, if the 1% pulled their money out of banks, it would make a huge impact. When OWS does it, they just laugh.

Should be a caveat that this is true of **some** but not all stocks. I mean in a certain sense this is true of all stocks as the "gotcha" is what is the real *value* of anything, but in reality this post is one of those academic arguments that is a bit misleading. TSLA is a particularly shifty example as it is explicitly valued on growth (something ethereal and not tangible). A lot of valuation methods are based on tangible assets or the cash flow from those assets, ie NAV, yield and EBITDA based valuation methods.
