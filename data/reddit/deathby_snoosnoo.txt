Oh, so you weren't really there to drink?
@_date: 2014-04-01 06:25:36
Well, no, I meant free 2-day shipping. That's the main reason I usually buy from amazon.

How did you go about actually getting to politics?
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:56:54
I'd cry. Bitcoins? Plural? Man... Haha
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:03:44
What the fuck is wrong with you. Go someplace shittier.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:43:22
what is?
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:46:18
Well that sucks.

How much is a bit?
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:39:54
AFAIK beer here in pittsburgh is ~$3 at a bar. I've seen some of the cheaper brands for as little as $1.50 at some of the more divey bars.

I have been watching frak tons of bsg lately. Nice. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 09:37:45
That's cool, what sort of stuff did you volunteer to do?
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:40:25
I mean I haven't been to a lot of different bars, I just turned 21 so maybe I'm wrong. I dunno. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:14:19
Why?? It's so much more convenient. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:55:50
Yeah I thought of that haha thank you.

You're better off creating an instant electronic payment system.
@_date: 2014-04-21 19:02:35
Honestly IMO NFC tags are a way better way of doing that than a qr code or Bluetooth le. They hold a few kilobytes of data, so you could store the wallet address (I'm not sure if that's how it works, I don't use bitcoin a ton) and then make the payment automatically through the internet and a bitcoin app.

Man, I wish I had that kind of disposable income. Shit. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:52:25
Wow, I have never seen that. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 21:02:47
I actually had a really hard time time with it. It's really frustrating when there's no clear protagonist/antagonist.

Does overstock have 2 day shipping like amazon prime?
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:53:14
But how many bitcoins? Millibitcoins? Microbitcoins?
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:55:49
That's it! Thank you!

It's $40 a year after the first 6 months as a student. I thought it was only $80 a year regularly?

Oh my god that music is beautiful. I wish I had the money to buy that
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:57:09
Why is that good news?
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:42:32
Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 07:48:04
Ah. I buy literally hundreds of dollars a year off of amazon, honestly i buy most of my stuff there, and prime is only $40 a year so it's really worth it to me.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:23:02
Damn. I could get so much more drunk than that where my one friend DJs haha
