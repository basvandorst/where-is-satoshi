Good for you, but personally I'd never throw bitcoins at witchcraft and I hope the businesses accepting it will more frequently offer crucial services and goods than at present.

What? It seems you skipped something there... In any case, $40 (and other banking fees) is a much smaller percentage of your wealth if you're rich. The less wealthy you are, the more you have to gain in this respect.

No, that's [dollar-cost averaging](  a popular method of investment.

Where do the Chinese read about and discuss bitcoin? What are their forums for bitcoin and do they have sites filling the function of reddit's r/bitcoin, r/bitcoinmarkets etc.? Do you have any links to the more popular Chinese newspaper articles about bitcoin? What do you think the Chinese buyers and sellers will do next week and why (i.e. are there more buyers coming in?)

It means supply or stock, and comes from French. Use a dictionary or etymology lexicon---that is, your other tab.

I'll give it a spin.

Fees are going to change, different clients offer options to adjust fees, and miners need money for their equipment and work.  
Also, with "free" email, you are the product. Every email you send is labor email service providers capitalize upon--at the cost of reduced privacy etc.

Bitcoin is not only going up. Just look at the charts to see this in action each day. We can now see that a 10%-fluctuation in one hour would not be particularly surprising anymore. In 365 days at this same time of day bitcoin might be worth 1,000% more than now. In 366 days it might be 0.01% of today's value. Considering you're asking anonymous people for financial advice, how can you be sure you'll buy, and eventually sell, at the right times?
Why would you trust a bunch of unknown wankers online with no credentials--just because they're in r/bitcoin? Most r/bitcoiners are fanatics and know next to nothing about investment, day-trading, arbitrage, sound personal finance and so on.

What is the difference between this and Mint or Ubuntu?

It'll die by then. Then someone will buy the coins as a collectors items, furthering the cycle.

Tell them to begin by using their brains and actually researching the phenomenon together with you.  
Also, how do *you* know it's not a scam?

He's been deceptive about the downtime, doesn't have a firm grasp of the correct tone used for customer service (should hire a copywriter) and there are a few embarrassing statements he's made online. Look it up at e.g. Flashback where he publicly states retribution toward a client whose property he confiscated.

I follow bitcoinmarkets more or less, but also try to gather auguries from Google Trends and other sources.

Download a client, like Electrum or Multibit, to store money locally. Install program. Open program. Open wallet. Copy an address from said wallet. Send select amount of XBT from where you bought XBT to said address. Wait and/or check updates at blockchain.com/address/[address]. You now have XBT on your computer. Read the info the right.

Guy who runs it is very unprofessional. Wouldn't trust him with a proper service infrastructure or transparency.

As long as Norway has oil and everyone will pay well for it, Norway'll do anything it can to support the value of its national monopoly money.
