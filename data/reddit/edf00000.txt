I wonder whether a transaction script could be formulated which requires two steps, separated by a certain number of blocks.
That way you could manage this yourself by noticing when step one enters the blockchain and then pushing a cancelation transaction.

Why, what makes that ironic?

I don't follow how blockchain.info centralizes bitcoin. Are you just referring to their wallet service? That seems different in that one person using an online wallet doesn't put my own wallet at any greater risk.

Fewer nodes willing to store the full blockchain?

This does look like the solution. Are they still a non-standard transaction type though? If so, institutions like the exchanges must be using a different system.

It's different in that you can verify the integrity of your gold holdings by just checking them.
Checking your private key on the other hand doesn't verify that someone else doesn't have a copy though.
Essentially, knowing where the bitcoin-gold is is equivalent to owning it.

haha, maybe across a dinner table.

Why would 0.4% be The Inflation Rate We Need™?

I see. I thought this commit would have the receiving nodes reject the transaction.

Yeah, I sent an email to my tax advisor yesterday, asking whether he understands the taxation of cryptocurrencies. I suspect I'll have to find someone else.

I'm seeing this through all the way, or seeing it go to zero. I'm never selling until I'm completely financially secure. Fuck wage slaver.

I'm not sure I can follow this. Does she mean that the value of a cryptocurrency could be tied to some other value unit - i.e., an altcoin which is pegged to the dollar/eur/etc?

Neither of us have said that inflation or deflation are inherently bad. We're asking how inflation/deflation responsive to an economies needs could be programmed into a crypto-currency.
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:16:05
I'm not entirely against inflation. I don't know how to work it into a decentralised monetary system though.
To me, the point of inflation seems to be giving some well-meaning central authority some leverage on directing the economy. I could be wrong about this though.

How many do you have? See, if someone has 1000, I strongly believe they'll have 10 million usd one day.
That's only 1 million for me though. I don't think that's good enough for me.
Oh god, what have I become?
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:46:48
Are you declaring the sale of them, or do you also have to declare having purchased/mined them?
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:56:08
Doesn't bitcoind reject unreasonably fee'd transactions?
Did they push their transaction through a nonstandard client?
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:33:58
So you're saying the programmers should act as central banking authorities..
Of course the programmers can change anything they like in their fork of the bitcoin repository. They have no power to change the actual network beyond what the miners will adopt though. They even risk forking the network if only some miners adopt their changes.
You see how much controversy QE causes in the US? How would QE ever happen if everyone could just choose not to go along with it?

@_date: 2013-12-21 19:23:24


That's exactly my point. If a centralised authority can't get it right, how will a decentralised network? We have no clue yet.
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:54:54
What would be good inflationary parameters for a decentralised currency? Or, how would you propose the network dynamically adjust its inflation rate?
Lastly, how do you propose distributing the inflationary coins? Do the miners get them?
Why would distributing those coins to miners have an equivalent effect as the distribution of quantitative easing fiat?

Emptying a bitcoin address is still a single gesture, whereas emptying a physical vault would trigger alarms while in progress. Once you find out someone else has your private-key, it's already too late.
The solution seems to be m-of-n multi signing. I'm trying to find evidence of these being used in the blockchain, in connection with exchanges, etc.

No, I actually enjoy living in a civilised country with functioning public services, lol.
