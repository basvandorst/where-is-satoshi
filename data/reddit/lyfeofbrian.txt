i honestly doubt any altcoin even wants that spot atm. especially ethereum. they had a 300mil hack last year. i understand its the smart contracts that get hacked but its a smart contract platform. some alts die just from pump and dumps. imagine being number 1 and failing. the complaints of btc are minimal in that regard.

i hope coinbase goes away before long.

im curious what type/model of fire safe you had. i personally have a first alert media safe. i might have overlooked it but i cant tell if you had a media fire safe or just a fire safe. cause im hoping the media safe is better protection against the water and even the fire.

lol. the great lambo shortage of 2020 is stressing people out already.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:34:19
i cant use or recommend coinbase anymore. they leaked the info and now are saying bcash is worth like $8500, on their locked down site. i assume trying to get other exchanges to catch up
@_date: 2018-09-11 03:10:11
next time bring a lasso jimmy. 
felt like roger wanted to cry when talking about the central figures in bcash fighting among each other. 
its a good point that republicans and democrats argue all the time. if that stuff was driven home more, i think he might snap. 
roger good at distracting into focusing on what he wants to focus on though. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:56:37
i dont blame them. nobody orders b grade meat for example. they want that A1cash.

stop scamming people roger.

stop scamming people roger.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:06:22
so another area of confusion. great. problem is, recommending them was easy, the way they had everything was easy. now to recommend them you have to explain stuff. and im not doing that. so im looking for an alternative that i can recommend. also use myself to be familiar for simple questions.
@_date: 2018-09-14 00:15:18
have you ever heard of any of the hacks when companies lose everyones data. 
p.s. stop scamming people roger.

bitcoin turbo 3000 is the real bitcoin.

george bush doesnt care about alt coins.

ltc runs a different algo. the idea was if they 51% attack bitcoin, ltc will still work. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:30:44
the great lambo shortage of 2020. here we come.
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:46:08
i just want to be friends, no big deal!
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:48:44
im in the 21 club and all i got was a bunch of fake bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:14:02
there are dozens of us, dozens!
@_date: 2019-08-29 11:25:26
i agree. i doubt there is some conspiracy to do with price predictions lol. but wouldnt surprise me if a person who names these things is into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:12:29
whoa, this is heavy. something must be disrupting the great lambo shortage of 2020 timeline. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:06:20
the great lambo shortage of 2020 is upon us. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:41:59
just cycles of reaping the benefits. 
sometimes people are losing their minds fomoing into btc, sometimes out of btc.
be like lovitz.
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:34:16
i think there is so much more to it.
for one they had their heads down in their work and when they looked up they were super rich, top level status. bc the rich compete just as much as the poor with status. in fact society says they are house hold names bc they are super rich. not bc we use their tech everyday, i use lots of tech everyday. no idea who invented it.
they are internet businesses not really based on any form of personal branding. so they didnt need to impress clients or the general population. they didnt have to sell themselves.
@_date: 2019-01-02 10:27:44
most people down own very much. so if theres a problem, it will be most people who get screwed.
@_date: 2019-01-21 06:38:34
1. buy the ticket.
2. take the ride.
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:56:38
thats what i did. worked out well. been almost 5 years or so.
@_date: 2019-01-02 21:11:30
its not. but you should get a ledger or trezor. i think trezor aound $100. and ledger like half that, not sure exactly on that one. just buy from the manufacturer. i would also recommend a first alert media safe. i bought one a few years ago for $120 or so. then you can start feeling safe imo.
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:53:31
i doubt it. i have other illnesses that haunt me. well maybe if a major breakthrough happens in medical science
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:09:54
the great lambo shortage of 2020. im glad people are starting to wake up.
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:36:47
i really dont understand the debate. its not one or the other, and it never will be. i have small amounts of usd. and large amounts of btc.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:26:58

you can do gpu mining, asic mining. on a good day you can get 2 blocks in 10 mins. you got bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, bitcoin platinum, super bitcoin, bitcoin private. thats..thats about it.
@_date: 2019-05-08 05:37:23
im waiting for the next couple days to buy bitcoin cz
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:47:39
followers want leaders. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:53:45
he dreams big. its very common for big companies and such to lose out of everything bc of it. you have to scale properly.  
to ever estimate 100% adoption is foolish imo. many people dont know how to read. dont get medicine or electricity.  whole world of problems you would have to tackle to even entertain the idea of 100% adoption. so every north korean and every prisoner and every homeless person on the planet uses bitcoin. thats how thats gonna work right. plus they would all desire/need a lightning channel.
can you imagine how many people dont give a shit and never will. being in america, ill use usd for everyday transactions. cash is more anonymous than bitcoin and pretty damn instant. 
roger really needs to come to grips with the idea that bitcoin isnt the solution to every problem.
