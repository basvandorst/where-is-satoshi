Do you feel better knowing it was from tips as opposed to your own investment?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:28:02
I know that feeling. 
But if you made some money that's good. People need to sell to keep BTC going. And I'm sure you bought again at a lower price than it currently is. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:35:03
Sorry to hear. Do you ever think about it now as the price is this high?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:08:58
I'm sorry to hear. That's worth a lot now. How have you moved on?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:58:13
Oh my! That's a lot. When was this?

Ouch! How much?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:41:43
make someone go talk to him about bitcoin using Socratic questioning.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:28:53
Damn MtGox. 
You know the funny thing. I lost 2 BTC on coinbase! Nowhere is safe.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:11:48
18! Was it your money or others as well?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:46:37
Good for you. Have you re-invested since then?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:30:22
Are they in Jail now?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:43:00
I did lose a bit in MtG as well. Are those guys in jail now?
I really understand how you feel. Same with me. It took me a while, a long while. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:59:12
Sometimes your mistake can be someone else answer. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:30:03
Oh my! Do you ever think about it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:40:05
You have a good way of dealing with it. Ah! the famous pizza guy, I wonder how he feels. Then again, I'm sure he would have bought more since then. 
It's also a story that stops people from spending their BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:10:55
Sorry to hear. When was this?
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:21:26
Really? he is asking for help and guidance you know? 
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:19:50
I love dogecoin but i don't think this is the right place or time to talk about it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:51:20
And this is the future we all want? 
@_date: 2018-07-04 03:38:58
Upvoted! I think you did very well. What do you think of the current market and which coins are you looking into now? 
@_date: 2018-07-04 04:00:25
Brilliant!!! I’m currently reading “the intelligent investor” and your approach to the prices/market hit the cord. 
BTC is safe, but I warm up to your reasoning behind investing in monero back then as opposed to BTC (even when you predicted it’ll go up more than 50x) 
What are the major things you look for in a coin before you invest? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:09:04
Absolutely! I reached out to them in every possible way. Have they replied you yet? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:52:57
Not as big as yours but in 2015, 2 BTC was stolen from my coinbase account. 1 BTC was exactly $268 dollars then. 
The stoped replying to my messages. And I gave up. 
I really wish you the best of luck. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:13:59
Yes, I had 2FA enabled. Ever since i signed up. It was through their API that was turned off. They probably did something with a cron update and automatically turned it on. I have no clue how else. They didn't reply to investigate further. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:20:57
Ah! I got the joke. ��

If you investing hoping to make a profit. Honestly it's not just you. The best is to invest for the long run if you really believe in BTC and crypto in general. 
If you're looking for quick profit. My advise is:
1. Cut your loses. Sell it. 
2. Pick a price below the current price you'll buy back at. 
3. If the price goes below that price you picked, pick another price below the current price. Keep doing this as it keeps falling. 
4. If it starts rising, pick a second price you'll buy at above the current price. 
5. When it goes above the second price, keep watching the ratio of buy vs sell orders.
6. Buy when you feel confident people are buying way more than they're selling. 
7. Buy.
Ps: Use price alerts tool to monitor you upper and lower price boundaries. 
That has worked for me so far. It's definitely not a guarantee and  I'm not a financial advisor. 
I know nothing. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:31:26
I was just trying to help :) 
Regardless, if you're still holding BTC and hoping it'll go back up, you're technically investing. 
Goodluck.
