With massive upwards volatility comes massive downwards volatility - aka hyperinflation.

wget is not really an issue because there would not normally be any confidential data inside the wget process that couldn't be read from off the wire anyway. This bug does not allow reading memory of other processes.

You are conflating two definitions of inflation here - the archaic Austrian definition, which is about the quantity of money (in which what "backs" it is irrelevant), and the modern definition, which is about the price level. Bitcoin is only "inherently deflationary" when viewed through the Austrian lens.

Yes, let's look at those chances.
Malicious actor gains control of more than 50% of the processing power? Possible.
Quantum computing enables public key encryption to be broken? Theoretically possible, but purely speculative at this point. No guarantee that quantum computing can be scaled up to that kind of level. Anyway, a *lot* of other systems would be broken by this, not just bitcoin.
P proved to be = NP and this enables public key encryption to be broken? By definition, we kind of don't even know if that's theoretically possible, but yes, in some sense it's theoretically possible. That's a real wildcard.

However, if the 16 year old couple are married or in a civil partnership, or living together as if married or in a civil partnership, it is legal *in the UK* for them to possess such photos (as long as they only depict each other, and no-one else). At least the law has some sanity in that respect.
But they should be careful not to take such images with them if they're travelling abroad, where this defence may not apply!

Demand for BTC is not demand for mining per se - people (mostly) don't care where their BTC came from.

Cash is not untaxable. Cash transactions are taxed all the time.

That's just a guess. If everyone thinks like this guy, difficulty could more than double.

OK, this actually makes sense. Spies (and for that matter troops) operating behind "enemy lines" would presumably find it useful to be able to send or receive money anonymously. So from that perspective this could be looked at similarly to how the US government funded/created TOR.

Um, journalists aren't required to add new stuff. They're not academic researchers.

But cash "can't be taxed" either, by the same logic.

Oh great, what I predicted a few days ago has already happened. Someone has allowed a frickin Google login to get access to online money. You do use a secure password for your google account right? And you don't use the same password on any other site, right?

I think your fund proposes to somewhat smooth out short-term volatility (and I am not even convinced it would do that), but your fund could not affect long-term and mid-term appreciations due to growth in the fundamentals of the bitcoin economy (assuming the bitcoin economy ever will have any serious fundamentals!).

Unless we can somehow do a 180 and present it as all about "helping oppressed people in Syria and other dictatorial regimes", I don't think it's going to get government support. Government acquiesence is probably the best we can hope for.

This is a common investment fallacy. *Past performance is no guarantee of future returns*. Economics says it is irrational to invest in a managed fund, never mind Madoff risks. You're paying fees on the basis of fallacious reasoning. You'd be better off picking stocks by throwing darts at a wall.

I repeat my question. What would be the purpose? It wouldn't be anonymous, it wouldn't be decentralised, it wouldn't be a stable store of value...

Yes, I must confess to trolling a little there.

An efficient market will see profits drop to zero, especially taking into account all the people that will be taking advantage (with or without permission) of electricity they don't pay for.

Price seems to be influenced by demand not mining at the moment. Mining is still very profitable (if you already have the hardware).

That's pure fantasy. The IRS wouldn't dream of encouraging an electronic currency which (like cash) can be used to facilitate tax evasion.

Doesn't your bank use physical security devices, so that a hacker would need to *both* physically gain access to your own personal security device, *and* find out your login details? That's the only sensible way to handle large money transfers to random accounts. If your bank doesn't give you a physical security device, you should ask them why - and maybe switch to another bank!
@_date: 2011-06-15 08:11:10
So basically equivalent to an anonymous regular money transfer service, which will probably be frowned upon by regulators if it transfers serious amounts of money.
Or, if it's not even anonymous, what would be the point of using bitcoin for it?
@_date: 2011-06-15 07:48:04
I would have thought that if there were a serious market opportunity here, someone would have already implemented it, with or without bitcoin.
For people who need serious computing power, it is probably cheaper to just build/buy a cluster, or buy EC2 time. (Or go the folding route and rely on donated computing power.)

No-one can predict with confidence what the price of bitcoin is going to be in 6 months, let alone 30 years. Bitcoin might not even exist in 30 years.

SCAM ALERT!!!!!
What are these scary-sounding "CES paring databases" or "CES pairing databases" as mentioned in the document, supposedly mentioned in the Snowden releases? The only mention I can find of them on the internet is in this PDF file itself!
Here's my guess at what's going on here:
Step 1. Invent scary-sounding Orwellian technology urban legend.
Step 2. Publicise it anonymously, ask for Bitcoins at the end so you can do "further research".
Step 3. Profit!
There is no way to verify who these Bitcoins would go to or whether any follow-up research is actually being done with them. How convenient!
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:46:37
I know, but that would only make sense if the FBI would keep the coins forever. And why would they do that?
Only one reason would make sense - and that is if they thought that Bitcoins were somehow inherently illegal.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:32:44
"Crashingly" stupid assumption if so. If the FBI somehow thought that bitcoin was illegal per se, that would mean they would be coming after random bitcoin owners just for owning bitcoin. They don't think that, and they won't.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:30:44
Oh please. It is not the FBI's concern that the value of your favoured currency might drop for a little while. If you think this will happen, just buy after the FBI sells and you see the price drop, and profit from it - don't whine.
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:45:07
Ah, so did you mean "recklessly" meaning not getting the full value of the coins they were selling? In that case I misread your comment - I thought you were implying the FBI has a duty to take into account the effects of its actions on the price of Bitcoin in dollars.

That's why you have automated tests! But startups often don't - they cut corners.
My advice: don't work at a startup until they are not a startup any more.
