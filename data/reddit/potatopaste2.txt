I have have a good experience using  they have mobile authentication and email confirmations.  The security is pretty good compared to other sites I've used in the past.  Once you have your BTC in your wallet, transfer it to your trading account at wherever you are trading but be very careful.  To make sure you're doing it right I suggest only transferring .001 btc to begin (roughly 1 dollar).  Then you can trade BTC for USD instantly and also if you have a checking account you can link your checking account/debit card to your account and deposit money instantly.

it has gone up about 30-40 dollars in the past two hours.  but theres a chance it could go anywhere at all times (especially when you are sleeping).  The choice is yours.

not sure, it seems to be on a momentary downtrend.  It will probably start going up again but with the way its going after it hits its next peak it could go even lower.  There's no way to tell right now with all the Chinese regulations people are very very skeptical right now.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:00:07
If bitcoin crashes you could make good money.  What people don't realize is that this was exactly how it was when bitcoin got to $1000.  Everyone doesn't realize how careless they are when they think its cool to post things like "bitcoin always goes up" or just "hold and you'll get free money."  Bitcoin is where it is now all the way from 300 dollars.  If you can see past the garbage advice and all the idiots who just want karma and attention here you'll realize that there's not very many people who know how to be patient.  
Getting something 'early' doesn't mean anything in the trading world.  After bitcoin hit 1000 it declined 70%.  It took a year but imagine if you did other things and were able to be patient enough to realize that long plays always outweigh the benefits of day trades.  Day trading can be fun when the market is good but the market hasn't been very good for a while now so I'm doing other things.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:15:34
Well I know what I wouldn't do.  I wouldn't go all in with it at $2,800 per bitcoin that's for sure.

Shut the hell up trying to tell people who need answers and getting them into a shitty deal after Bitcoin has gone down 200 dollars and has been getting shit on by sells for over a week.

When Litecoin activated segwit, because it had been so low for so long, it turned out really well for the price.  I don't think the same can be guaranteed here.

It is not crashing that much.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:59:40
Actually yes it is bitcoin.  It was made from bitcoin.  In fact, in terms of what our society has shown an interest in (scalability), it's better than bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-03 18:51:12
All the seller sees when you put an order on is "I want to buy this many bitcoins at this price."  There's a lot of people who have made enough money to where they don't feel the need to hang on to all of their bitcoins all the time so they sell and sometimes they sell a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:27:06
That's good.  I'm not trying to make people feel misrable here.  I'm more of a comedian than someone who gets worked up over comments.

I was thinking about starting a joke "make a bitcoin cash logo" thread it might be fun.  Maybe in a few days.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:32:40
Oh really?  I thought it went up because of segwit.  That's pretty good to know thanks for sharing.  I had a feeling I might have been incorrect.  The news that Segwit was going to be activated though did make it go up to around 30 though did it not?  It's just the run was finished by then.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:12:09

@_date: 2017-08-03 18:42:11
I would be more concerned for the seller's value and I think they would agree that putting up a sell wall is always better.  You may not sell them all but at least you get the price you ask for.

imo should be called meme-pool

Personally I think bitcoin went up because of crowd psych, not the other way around.  Please stop trying to trick honest people into helping your failing bet!  It could go up eventually again but brainwashing isn't right.  Stop!

If someone told everyone to jump off a cliff would you?  This reddit is ridiculous!!! Jesus!  It's not like this is monopoly!!  Bitcoin got cut in half and people act as if it's still going to the moon tomorrow!  Get real!!!!!

I'm sorry to hear that.  It's too bad we disagree.  I'm not deleting my post.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:58:19
To safeguard you against any trolls I guess if you think about it stocks never "produce" anything either but they make up a large portion of the economy.  I figure with the amount of electricity put into bitcoin on a daily basis there has to be some value in that.  I think you're right though since stocks are sort of based on real companies.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:54:03

I guess so it's like using water to water crops.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:14:54
Maybe the problem lies in what happens to the tether after the money used in the wire transfers is taken out.  Tether is created when money goes in but nothing happens when money leaves as far as I have heard.  That just sounds unhealthy.  It seems impossible that money is just going to enter a market and never leave.
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:38:40
Don't worry. A lot of people here are negative 100% of the time and wont take you seriously if you have a comical username like yours or mine no matter how successful you are.  I'm sure you have some experience.  Good luck.
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:04:42
That's cool I don't know much about the history of why stocks were created thank you for the information.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:26:34
It could just be me but if the amount of tether correlates to the market cap of tether then all I see is a direct correlation between tether creation and bitcoin market value when I look at the charts in that article.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:32:57
I don't think so unless you are sure the buyer is done.  It's really not a good idea to short right now in my (experienced) opinion.  They are being driven by their rage or greed right now.  It's pretty possible to make some quick 20 dollar buy plays but they are at times when they don't seem like they should work.  It's basically opposite day right now good luck!  In my (experienced) opinion again every time something gets to over a "half mark" such as 2,500 if it doesn't have enough momentum it's very iffy to bet it will keep going up.  It's a toss up right now.  I'd wait for more info to short if you want to short more than 10 minutes at a time.
If anything I don't know the worst thing right now to me (it's just an opinion) is to be all in.  It doesn't seem like it's going to the moon any time soon.  I usually do a long play followed by shorter "shit coin" like plays if it goes past where I expect.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:53:46
looking better by the minute
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:44:17
Well let's just say they're probably not going to be buying 90 bitcoins every 10 minutes forever.  Especially if it gets to 1 million dollars per bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:50:47
Yeah that sucks, I'm sure they'll be back have faith!  I hope it's soon darn I'm sorry to hear that friend!
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:05:23
I think we will get to August 1st and it won't seem as spectacular as everyone thinks and it will slowly drop off from there.  -OR- Hit a new high and then decline.  It's been needing to decline some more for a good minute here.

You're right.  If bitcoin had no value no one would freaking be here.  Or at least a lot less people would.  It would turn into something less than even dogecoin.  My guess it that it would turn into Runescape.

It depends on who you buy it through I think it may have just been focused on coinbase purchases but I am fairly certain I read that somewhere.  I apologize I cannot give a direct source offhand.  Edit: here is an article which may give you some insight although I don't know about it's validity for sure: 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:04:17
I think people have been buying a lot in hopes that it will "skyrocket" on august 1st but the run they have been hoping for has been happening the past couple days on and off and I don't think it will continue on August 1st.  It's not like the "hard fork" is going to buy a million bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-03 20:36:20

I don't know.  When bitcoin splits not many people have suggested that both the "new" coin and the original one could actually -both- go down.  It's not a guarantee that one of them will just go up after it happens.
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:52:31
well best to give that person exactly what they want then am I right. Satoshi I think would be real happy about that one.  I mean it's not like this currency was made to be decentralized and everything. /endsarcasm  
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:06:22
Yeah any new improvement as magical as it seems isn't going to purchase any bitcoins for anyone.  Sure it's an improvement but it's not like it's going to make it go to 10,000 dollars overnight.

You will most likely get really excited once you make your first trade but times can be really slow and you can't make very many trades sometimes.  It's been 2 good weeks (up or down) then two slow weeks (no where really) as of late.  It can get -really- boring when it doesn't go anywhere.
