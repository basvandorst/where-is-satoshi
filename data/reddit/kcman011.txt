Honestly, at this point I think it's all about speculation. Look at Steam backing out of taking Bitcoin, for example. There are a lot of problems with Bitcoin right now, one of them being the fact that its price has jumped 600% in the last six months.

What is happening this month is just unreal.

Because anything that isn't HODL is FUD, duh! /s

Yep, although by that time I only had about 500k Doge left, so I donated like 100k of it.

He earned 22.43 Bitcoin for that stunt, which is the equivalent of right at $350K right now. It was $24K at the end of 2013 when he did it, for those who don't read the article.
I remember reading about it on both and when it happened and, to the surprise of no one, everyone was losing their collective shits on both subs.

I was speaking to OP's post about adoptability and usability. I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2011. I definitely know how it works.
Also, I hope you went long on ETH back when it was $8/coin
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:09
I'm lowkey hoping for this, as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:42:09
Wow, you weren't fucking kidding!

What is happening this month has been absolutely unreal. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:52:08
It's gone from 6000 to 15500 in 3 weeks. At that growth, it'll be at 40k by the end of the year.

Honestly, Dogecoin is getting a lot of people into cryptocurrency. Do you think they're going to all of a sudden just switch over to Bitcoin, where they can only get a portion of a coin for less than $800+?
Currency is meant to be spent, and people who hold dogecoins are doing just that. They are tipping others, donating to what they feel are worthy causes, and actually spending them at websites that take dogecoin and businesses in their area that do, as well.
Dogecoin has only been in existence for just under 2 months, and already has a full head of steam. The owners of the coin have already partially funded an Olympic team, donated to multiple charities (just today have already reached 40% of a 30K goal for one in particular), helped it to become the 5th highest capped crypto, and have made it the highest mined script coin over the last 30 days.
All this makes me believe this coin isn't going anywhere. It will be the copper to the Bitcoin gold and Litecoin silver standards.

I have never seen so much gold in a thread. Great job,  @_date: 2017-01-06 04:51:58
Like many early adopters, I only wish I had bought more! I'm certainly not complaining, though. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:53:45
I have bitcoins. 
/hides computer they're stored on 
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:28:41
Yep, I can vouch for this. Been holding all but 10 coins since 2011!
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:09:40
Dogecoin...ah, memories. I remember donating a million of those coins to get the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics like it was nbd. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:06:43
He probably had more, but that's all that's left. I held over 500 coins at one point. I still have a few left, but hindsight being what it is, I wish I still had what I originally started with.
Same with Litecoin. I bought in when it was .25/coin. Sold like 95% of them once it hit $5/coin. C'est la vie.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:27:56
Oh, yeah, he did say that, didn't he? Reading comprehension is hard at 8 am apparently. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:49:24
WHERE THE FUCK ELSE IS IT GONNA GO?!

WE ARE ALL WITNESSES 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:01:55
Shit, if only I'd still held on to the 500 coins I bought in 2010.
The fact that I'd be sitting on over a million bucks sickens me, but se la vie. At least I still have some that I'm clutching and have comfort in the fact that without early adopters it wouldn't have taken off.

She's very prudent with money. I'm the gambler out of the two :) 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:08:17
Thanks. I haven't even really been paying attention to the currency again until a few days ago. I just told my wife about how much it's worth. She was mad at me then when I invested in 'worthless Internet monopoly money' and she's upset now because I didn't sit on 'that goldmine' lmao
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:39:54
Oh, yeah, duh... I knew that! 
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:51:24
You mean $19.5 million knife @ $2447/coin
