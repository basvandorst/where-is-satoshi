The population of humans in developed countries who haven't always had access to computers or The Internet in their lifetime is decreasing by the day. Once those generations have died out then adoption of new technology will increase exponentially based on the surviving generations' familiarity with technology. As a result, Cryptocurrencies will enjoy a quick and widespread adoption in my opinion

What a scumbag. Seems as if MtGox will be the next Bitcoin behemoth to fall(first being the Silk Road) before the value of BTC can spike again.

His logic is sound. Educating those uninitiated in power so that Bitcoin's future isn't stifled by legislation founded on Bitcoin ignorance.

If the American government gains backdoor access to current encryption methods then new, uncircumventable methods will be created as a result. Thus, the endeavor of pushing for a backdoor to current encryption methods is an exercise of futility.

It's literally the reason that I got into bitcoin

Be that as it may, it still conquered that soft fork.

It's fine for multiple countries to use the term "dollar" in the name of that country's fiat. I think this concept translates.

The pace and nature of the Bitcoin market and currency isn't tolerant to 7-10 day lags of payment when purchaing/selling. If your company's systems aren't scaling to the exponential demand that your customer base requires then consider investing in your future and growing to support the growing Bitcoin community. If you do not then others inevitably will :/

I was seriously considering buying a BFL BPU before reading this solely because it's one of the few pieces of hardware at that mid-high level that actually has a "purchase" button. I'm in the process of contacting KnC for hardware now but no response yet. Wish there was an easier way to obtain mining hardware!!!
