Good question...I'm still holding the original position I acquired back at 8-15. I wanted to buy more when we crossed $50 but wound up not pulling the trigger. I'm hoping we get one of these pullbacks and bounces to offer another buying opportunity.

BULLSHIT DETECTOR REDLINED. This story is verifiably false.
This is a poorly concealed - nay, downright transparent attempt to bring down the price of BTC so someone can jump in at lower levels.
This Dan Restrepo the article quotes as saying he's going to shut down SR?
"Dan Restrepo in the White House said “We have been monitoring the [Silkroad] website ever since it first came online. Our technical experts have managed to track down the location of the site. We are just waiting on an application for a European Arrest Warrant before it can be shut down for good."
He left the White House last year:
Also note the lack of sourcing. Total bullshit.
Of course, rumors are nothing new; they drive the stock market every day. They'll become common in the Bitcoin world too, as popularity spreads.

No argument there; I was just taking issue with the wording of the title, which made is sound like confiscation was about to happen.
Pretty frightening stuff overall. Just a matter of time before similar legislation is on the books in the U.S.

It's sensational to say Canada is "set to use" confiscations, as if they're about to employ that tactic. This is not imminent, nor is it likely anytime soon.
The difference between Canada and the EU is light years when it comes to the stability of their currencies and their banking systems. Canada has stricter regulations on its financial sector and was therefore able to weather the recession in a relatively strong fashion. Things would have to crater on a global economic basis before Canada resorted to the same types of measures.

None taken. The thing is, I believe that TA largely derives its usefulness from the simple fact that many market participants watch the same levels and indicators. Thus, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy as I described above, when prices and indicators converge.
Astrology is based on - well, total crap and wishful thinking.
At the very least, charting is interesting because it helps us see what's happening with the supply/demand dynamic. An even purer reading of this can be had through point-and-figure charts, which remove all the extra intraday noise. Interesting stuff.
