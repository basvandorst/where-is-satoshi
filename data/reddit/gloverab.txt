Not relevant, but I love your username.

I'm a front end developer by trade, and work in React JS (and *some* Native) every day. I'm interested in getting my feet wetter with Native, and strongly believe in Bitcoin, so once you have a UI design (or even just a wireframe design) I'd definitely be interested in contributing some time.

Are you me?? I did almost this exact same thing.  $15 apiece. Now they're flipping out.

Chiming in, this has happened to me a couple times as well.

I wish my landlord had to “convince” me to do that.

Updated related link for anyone who comes here off of a search like I did. Looks like Exodus has consolidated all info into one blog post.

Thanks for the quality posting and awesome product. After a couple of hours research today I downloaded Exodus and moved all my funds to it. After setting up and tinkering around with it, recommended it to 2 or 3 of my close friends too. Very tempted to apply for the JS job you have available, but sadly I'm afraid I'm not senior enough. Still may go for Customer Support.

Done.
