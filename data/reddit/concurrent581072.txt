I think what the bigger concern is that certain virus's have the capability to detect if they are being run in a VM, and if they are, they do not execute. Hence it can make the program look harmless, because the virus payload isn't executed because its in a VM.

It's not too uncommon for there to be delays withdrawing BTC from mtgox. I've heard as long as 72 hours, but could be a lot less. I saw this linked in their IRC, check for your transaction in there. I believe if its in there it should be processed eventually.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:46:18
Well I don't believe the issue is anything more than a technical issue. Taking one look at their monthly income and it just really doesn't make much sense to say they're insolvent. 
OP, idk what you expected to hear out of MtGox. If they say its a technical issue, they aren't going to tell you its anything other than a technical issue. I think it was nice of Mark and Gonzague to answer you questions, even if its not what you wanted to hear. They also shed some light on the fiat withdrawl issues, more so than they normally will talk about. 
It's good that the public got a few answers at least, but I'm not sure I support you harassing Mark and mtgox employees as they come into work, most likely taking away from time that could be use to FIX the problem. Mark was nicer than other CEOs would have been if you were harassing them as they went into work, so be lucky for that.

I can understand lots of people buying at Tigerdirect pushing price down because BitPay is selling the BTC it receives. BUT, there should be FAR more speculators pumping the price sky high.

I agree. Mark Karpeles has lost more than almost anybody in this whole thing. He lost all of his BTC(100k). He's lost his business. He may even possibly go to Jail. I am sure he feels horrible that he's caused this harm to so many people. It's not like he WANTED this to happen. I truly believe Mark is a good guy who has tried to do the right things, but was just in way over his head. 
You could just see it in his face in that press conference. When apologizing to everyone, he really did seem genuine and looked like he was really hurting. You could tell by how he was breaking up when apologizing. Then throughout the press conference, the look on his face. The sigh. I feel bad for everyone negatively effected from this ordeal, including Mark. It's sad all around.

Yeah they are obviously full of shit. The attack on the network related to transaction malleability, the very issue gox says they have been victim of, is fake too.

LOL hilarious. You dogeshit lovers prove every day just how retarded you all really are. This post got linked to the Dogecoin subreddit, and then downvoted to 0 points, whereas when I first posted it was up near top of Bitcoin's subreddit. What a bunch of losers. I totally agree with the post that claims the Dogecoin community is cult like. Describes them perfectly.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:43:06
Looking at volume in BTC, ofc its going to be MUCH higher. That is because the price of btc on gox is much much lower than other exchanges. So, $20K usd traded on Bitstamp would be much less btc than $20K usd traded on MtGox. 
If you look at volume in USD, they are actually lower than Bitstamp and BTC-E.

Well like I said it's a commercial that was aired last year but they seemed to just recently add the Bitcoin part at the end. It wasn't huge, in your face advertising of Bitcoin. Think of it like the small "We accept Bitcoin" logos you see on websites and such, that's what it was. Wasn't real big, but obviously big enough that I noticed it haha. Just being honest, don't want to say it was a huge bitcoin sign when it was actually pretty small.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:42:15
It amazes me how many people go around posting "mtgox is insolvent! its a ponzi! scam!" without understanding the issue at all. The issue is the banks, not mtgox. Their bank only allow them to transfer 100k eur via sepa per day and 10 international wires a day. Their japanese domestic transfer limits are much more reasonable(I think its around $1mill usd per day, but could be wrong), but that got backlogged due to the Japanese holiday.
Mtgox held 80-90% marketshare for quite awhile. During that time, they saved up MANY bitcoins as well as fiat. Even at their current volumes, they are still making a lot. Anyone who takes a look at their numbers, present and past, will realize there is just no way in hell they are anywhere close to broke.
@_date: 2014-01-20 02:11:39
You aren't going to get accurate results anywhere, because even if you post here all the dogecoin supporters jump over to this subreddit to upvote everything because thats what they do. Dogecoin a meme coin, going to be very hard to get an unbias opinion on reddit, because that's where they all lurk.
I'm sorry if your purpose wasn't to hyjack this subreddit, but the whole thing is such a joke. Scam/shit/joke coins don't usually bother me as much because people can usually see through it and realize what it truly is. Sadly people don't see the truth about Dogecoin.

The reason it was downvoted at first is because NOBODY HERE WANTS TO SEE IT. If we did, we would UPVOTE IT.

Satoshi probably mined one block and then stopped, then started back up again. Afterall he was testing.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:33:54
I personally do believe there is a good chance this is Satoshi. If it was an old guy making something up, I doubt he would know that  "It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection." That tells me he knows what Bitcoin is, so the chances he is just making stuff up is less likely. If the quote is true, this man admitted to being the creator of Bitcoin. He could know what Bitcoin is and is lying, but I find that unlikely.

They are using BitPay, which is a service that converts the BTC to FIAT instantly for the merchant. This way, the merchant isn't opened up to the volatility risks. BitPay takes the BTC on their behalf and they get paid in FIAT.

This is FAKE. Marionxd(which is the head of support and verifications iirc) has confirmed this is fake. She would know if people she supervised were being laid off.
@_date: 2014-01-19 05:46:06
It is true. They lost a lot of banking relationships when the US governemnt seized their funds. Many banks do not want to do business with them. Their current bank has a limit of like 10 wires per day going out. Hence why SEPA is moving quicker than international wires, because SEPA is cap limited based, where they can only send out so much per day/week.(cant remember if its a cap per day or week). International wires are limited to 10 wires per day.
Secondly, based on quotes of chats with Mark Karpeles(MtGox ceo) it sounds like the US government is making it very difficult to do any business in USD. They are supposedly trying to work with them to get this resolved, but it's moving very slow.
I am not here to defend MtGox, but some people just don't seem to understand the facts. If you are on the bad side of the US government, they can make business very difficult on you if your business involves USD at all.
@_date: 2014-03-23 09:49:14
It is the reason why we had the big China crash. The Chinese government banned banks from dealing with BTC, while also issueing a notice that it is not to be considered a currency and cannot be used to pay for goods or services. That's why baidu dropped it. It's why the price tanked. If you really want me to give you a source, I can link a few search results from reddit.
That is a quote from Bobby Lee. If anyone knows the laws in China regarding this, it would be him. Afterall, his exchange was the biggest exchange in China at one point(until this news hit, which really hurt his business) There are many other articles about it if you do a bit of searching. Point is, none of this is new. China made it clear it is not to be used as a currency and only as a commodity.

I think this is actually a pretty good idea. This is a better idea than sponsoring an e-sports team, because this way, we can put Bitcoin right in the title of the tournament. Something with the word Bitcoin in the title, this is key. Something like the "bitcoin open", thats just an example, something with Bitcoin in the name. 
There are many ways this can be funded. It can be by having some companys sponsor it, or even a fundraiser of some sort. Overall, there is a lot that can be done with this idea. I kind of like it and it doesn't seem THAT expensive, definitely do-able.

I'll admit, I was wrong. Given the evidence at the time, in which we had no idea about a btc shortage, it didn't make any sense for them to be insolvent. Once the news of the malleability came out, I thought it was possible they lost BTC. It turns out, they lost FAR more than I ever could have possibly imagined. I don't think many people imagined they could lose 850k btc though.

You are contributing to the problem by posting about it. Then, you go and crosspost it to to get them to upvote it. If we wanted to talk about it, it would have been upvoted. Instead, you are forcing Dogespam upon us all and you really look like a tool. You people ruin this subreddit for the rest of us.
The reason their subreddit is gaining so quickly is because most dogecoin users are reddit users. Most bitcoin users aren't reddit users. It's really quite simple.

Um, you can't say "YOU WERE WRONG" until this issue is actually resolved(or isnt). If its resolved, no, YOU were wrong because it will prove they had the BTC. Which most likely it will be fixed, because anyone with half a brain can take a look at the monthly income they take in and should know its just STUPID to say they're broke. I really think all the people that say they're insolvent doesn't even know what it means, because idk how someone can look at the data and logically say "OMG PONZI SCHEME MTGOX INSOLVENT SELL SELL SELL!".

The problem with Bitcoin is if you get your funds stolen, they are gone for good. With a credit card, you have protection and can most likely chargeback and get your money back. It is MUCH safer for the consumer, because there is the insurance that if you get money stolen, it can be reversed. The same cannot be said for Bitcoin. 
With so many people who have horrible security habits on computers, the chance that they know enough to secure their funds properly is pretty slim. Thus the chance of theft is high, and if it happens, they're SOL.
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:54:35
Absolutely huge that they are planning to keep the bitcoins. It is very surprising for such a large organization to take on that risk. Many props to them, I think the owner really sees the risk vs reward and is willing to take the chance. It could really pay off for them if bitcoin rockets.

MtGox can only wire 10 transfers a day. They are also limited to $100k euro per day as well. $1million japense yen per day. These are restrictions by their bank. After the seizures, they lost a lot of their banking relations. Now with governments down their throat and pending legal issues they cannot discuss, they are having issues with banks.
The BTC issue I believe is a technical issue like they say. They have more than enough in reserves to handle all the withdrawls. MtGox uses their own custom bitcoin software, and I suspect the problem is related to that. A bitcoin dev even commented how their system is quirky. It was probably just poorly coded and riddled with bugs. This issue has existed for months, it just never got this bad. They choose to ignore it until it got so bad that almost all withdrawls weren't going through. The spotlight is now on them so I expect they'll fix it pretty fast.
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:27:38
I debated it myself before posting it, but I saw the link getting circulated a bit on mtgox IRC, so people already knew about it. Even MtGox staff have linked to it.

I do agree though that nobody should be posting there unless they have something technical to discuss.

He lost his business. He lost his money. He may even go to jail. I am not defending him, as it sounds like as of now the reason the btc was lost was due to incompetence. But it's not like he WANTED this to happen. He has the most to lose out of anybody. I am truly sorry to everyone who lost money. Its a bad situation for EVERYONE.

@_date: 2014-03-02 04:29:39
Oh stfu. Did you not see the look on Karpele's face as he was going through that press conference? He looked scared to death and looked like he wanted to be sick. He wanted NONE of this to happen. Why the hell would Mark steal all those coins, when he was sitting on 100k btc of his own money(the company, which he held 88% of) and could have earned it without worry for the fear of his life and the fear of prison. He had the potential to earn a lot running a reputable exchange and he wouldn't have to worry about going to prison or fears for his life or anything like that. If you think Mark would purposely put himself in this position you are truly dumb. I mean, I think there is more to the situation than we know, but stupid shit like this just amazes me.
PLUS, you would rather see them liquidate and people get practically nothing, rather than them TRY to get peoples funds back? I think the people effected by this issue would STRONGLY disagree with you in this regard.

Not sure if you're a troll or not, but the whole point of de-centralized currency is so that no one entity can control it. What you are describing simply isn't possible.

@_date: 2014-03-23 07:52:41
Um, you currently can't pay for things with BTC in China(legally). This is nothing new - they banned businesses from accepting it months ago. The only step further that China's government can do is a complete ban of use of Bitcoin. Bitcoin in China is and has been pretty dead compared to what it was before the crackdown. It really doesn't matter what happens there anymore. Too many people around here still think China matters, when in reality, it hasn't mattered much for months.

Their communication is very poor. However, based on quotes I've seen, it really sounds like there are LEGAL reasons they are keeping quiet. That is just my impression, there is very clearly a reason they aren't saying much. I am thinking its legal, but it could be they just think they don't want to tell people the news if its really bad.
However, I don't think that's the case because I think most people would rather hear bad news than no news. I think people would be more forgiving if they just said that the US government is preventing them from doing business in the USA. That's why I think its legal(can't discuss a legal matter going on with the us government, that sort of thing). Like a gag-order sort of thing.

I anticipate as BTC-E's marketshare continues to grow(they are already the  exchange), it will become more likely one of two things happen. 1: They finally decide to reveal their identity and start requiring AML documents or 2: They stay anonymous and legal pressure heats up, potentially causing them to close up shop. They are anonymous so its possible they could run away with everyone's money. I'm not saying I believe that will happen, but we cannot deny that it is possible because they are anonymous.

I've always thought MtGox was solvent. With the amount of money they have taken in over the years, it would take gross mismanagement of funds to get anywhere close to insolvency. However, with the malleability issue on MtGox, it is possible btc was being stolen for months. There is the chance that they lost a LOT of btc due to this. Also something I never thought about is, when MtGox makes a profit, does he keep those funds available for MtGox, or does Karpeles transfer them to himself? It is possible that most profits have gone to karpeles himself, so there isn't all those extra coins and fiat that there should be to cover for losses and such. Chances are, if they are insolvent, Karpeles could pay out of his own pocket to fix the issue(depending on how much it is, if they are insolvent).
Throughout this whole issue, MtGox has yet to mention if customer funds are safe in any of their announcements. Then, Karpeles refuses to answer if they have everyone's bitcoins to that protester. Now he claims the issue is "confidential" to the press. If your company was solvent and customer funds were safe, I would think that you would want to come out as much as possible and re-assure people their funds are safe. MtGox has done the complete opposite. 
I cannot say for sure if they are insolvent, but based on all the evidence, there is definitely the possibility they are indeed insolvent, trying to hide it and make it up in fees. Plus, their new withdrawal caps they will be putting on btc withdrawals is another bad sign that they are trying to control the amount of coins going out so that they have more time to make up what they lost before they run out of coins.

At this stage of the game, many businesses cannot afford to risk the volatility associated with Bitcoin. Right now, Bitcoin is working more as a payment system than a currency. Until the value becomes stable, it will be like this. I anticipate it will be this way for a very long time to come.

"Sometimes, both individuals and corporations file for bankruptcy protection if they believe they can recover financially, given some time and some amount of restructuring and reorganization despite being in dire financial straits right now. Individuals file for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 and organizations file for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11.The court, instead of liquidating the assets, requests the company or the individual to come up with a re-structuring plan and it also assigns a committee from its side to protect other parties’ interests such as creditors and shareholders in the case of organizations."

I get the feeling this is due to the protesters.

It isn't surprising that a lot of countries have an anti-btc status. It only needs a few countries to truly embrace it. We cannot expect every country to be friendly to BTC. It would just be unrealistic to think so. Especially when it is countries like China and Russia it shouldn't be that much of a surprise.

The important part in there is this:  " Notably, Mr. Ranadivé said he will be willing to take bitcoin for the Kings' own account, unlike other merchants who have contracted Bitpay to process payments in the virtual currency but have elected to receive dollars at the end of the transaction. "
This is huge that they are willing to take on the risk associated with purely accepting bitcoin. Shows that the owner has a lot of faith in it, and it has the potential to make them a lot of money.

I truly believe Dorian is Satoshi, and there is a specific thing he says that sounds like hes lying to me. I point to this excerpt:
"He also said a key portion of the piece - where he is quoted telling the reporter on his doorstep before two police officers, "I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it" - was misunderstood.
Nakamoto said he is a native of Beppu, Japan who came to the U.S. when he was 10. He speaks both English and Japanese, but his English isn't flawless. Asked if he said the quote, Nakamoto responded, "no."
"I'm saying I'm no longer in engineering. That's it," he said of the exchange. "And even if I was, when we get hired, you have to sign this document, contract saying you will not reveal anything we divulge during and after employment. So that's what I implied."
"It sounded like I was involved before with Bitcoin and looked like I'm not involved now. That's not what I meant. I want to clarify that," he said."
Let's assume we believe what he says. Okay, that explains the "I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it" part. But it does not, at all, explain the "It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection." That is exactly what happened with Bitcoin. How can that statement possibly apply to engineering? It fits perfectly with Bitcoin. It is clear by his response he was referring to Bitcoin, in my opinion.

The conversion is done instantly. The cash is immediately added to the merchant's(in this case amazon's) account and then I think you can have it set up to do daily withdrawls. I believe there is a delay with companies receiving funds paid with a credit card as well, so this would be no different.

At the time when the bank account was made, Bitcoin was being treated as a commodity, not a currency. The regulatory status was unclear at the time so he figured he was in the clear.

However, after the guidance, he should have immediately changed the information for his bank accounts to reflect the new guidance.

Easy answer - most likely they aren't insolvent. The only scenario I see them being insolvent is if a TON of btc was stole due to their system not handling malleability properly.

This makes me think even more that Dorian truly is Satoshi. I mean, think about it. In the past when people have sworn they found out who Satoshi was, did the true Satoshi come out and claim it was false? Nope. But in this case, we haven't heard from Satoshi in years, yet after the news claims they found him, he shows up claiming its not him? Seems really suspicious to me.
What is really suspicious is the quote from the news. Either the reporter is COMPLETELY lying, or he more or less claimed he was involved in it. Then, later in the day, he claims he had nothing to do with Bitcoin. Two COMPLETELY different statements. What I think possibly happened was is the real Satoshi, who I believe could be Dorian, was so shocked that someone found him that he let it slip that he was involved in Bitcoin without really realizing what he had done. He had some time to think about it and then later in the day came out and completely denied he had anything to do with Bitcoin. THEN, a few hours later, we hear from the REAL, verified, Satoshi claiming its not him? Does that not seem suspicious to anyone else?
Truly, I believe there is a strong chance Dorian is the real Sataoshi and he is conducting damage control to try to get people off his back. I believe he is really worried now and is trying to do anything he can to get people to believe its not him.
@_date: 2014-03-15 05:08:57

Yes and in the process of having bank accounts seized that means they no longer have those banking partners. They lost a lot of options when all of that happened. I imagine(my guess) they banned them from those banks. I imagine the banks don't want to deal with anyone that is having any issues with the law, and by getting accounts seized, that's risk the bank doesn't want. My guess is that other banks are very cautious about dealing with MtGox if they have legal issues in the USA.
If you get on the bad side of the US government, they can make things hell for you.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:24:37
It really could be him and he decided that he made a big mistake saying "I'm not involved with that anymore." or he let it slip because he was in shock that someone found him. Then he comes out and says hes not the founder of Bitcoin, trying to take back what he said. Then again, the news article could be misleading too. Without a recording, we can't really know EXACTLY what he said.

I think one of their big problems is that Mark is their main coder and he does most of the stuff himself by the sounds of it. It doesn't sound like he trusts anybody else to work on sensitive parts of MtGox. I can understand that, but even government agencies have to trust external contractors and such to do work for them, and that work is far more sensitive than what goes on at MtGOx.
I agree with a lot of what you said. I think that he did it all himself and did it poorly. Instead of putting his pride aside and hiring someone who knows what they're doing, I think he thinks he can do it all himself, even if its something outside of his knowledge. 
Its obvious that its amateur hour over there and everything is done SLOW, sloppy, and just generally they are very incompetent. However, I do think they made the right choice by stopping withdrawls and finally making a real public statement on the issue. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:22:35

Or dare say anything bad about Dogecoin and they'll link your post to their subreddit and the whole lulz brigade will come and downvote you into oblivion.
