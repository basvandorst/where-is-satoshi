Yes we know.

I sure hope English isn't your first language. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 00:15:50
This will be downvoted and ignored. And in the next topic we start all over again.

Sad fucking kid.

No nobody else. You are the first person to post this. 
Retard. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 18:02:21
He feels it doesn't apply to him. He's more important than that. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:14:08
Yes we know. It was on top of the mainpage for 2 days. Stop this shit man. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 05:32:30
Funny how with everything the government says about this case you people scream 'innocent till proven guilty" and "alleged" but when his lawyers say something it instantly turns into a fact for you. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 04:11:23
You don't make much sense. But that's usually the case when people reject reality. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:55:48
You seem to be confused. Selling and buying things with BTC are 2 different things. 
Let me know if you need a detailed explanation.
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:19:50
Your druggie god tried to have people murdered. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 13:59:23
I might be wrong but didn't they already accept Bitcoin? What's different now?
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:22:59
@_date: 2014-07-08 07:23:23
You're about the 10th person to post this non bitcoin news. Can you idiots just stop please?
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:10:54
How many more times are you gonna post this shit you idiot. 
No, we won't covert to Peercoin and no you won't get rich because your 10 Peercoins will be worth a fortune by tomorrow. Go away. 
I'm reporting your posts from now on. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 21:17:37
Stop it. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 01:30:24
Because something is a plant it can't be drugs or bad for you? Seriously?
And no i have nothing against drugs or drug users. I have something against the bullshit they always manage to come up with. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 04:34:15
Take a guess why it is removed. 
You really can't come up with a reason yourself?
@_date: 2014-07-15 01:15:27
Stats experts. Funny. 
And asking random people on the internet what to do with your money is as retarded as it gets. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 05:11:35
The correct word would be "ignoring". It doesn't fit in their beautiful druggie utopia story so they simply ignore it. This kind of behavior seems totally acceptable and normal on this sub.

You got downvoted like me. 
Reality isn't allowed in here. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:17:32
He found a video on Youtube that says the media is wrong. Also his master Alex Jones probably came up with something retarded, which he blindly follows. 
It's funny how 1000's of muslims every day are praising ISIS on Facebook and Twitter. But some kid in his parents basement knows it's all lie by media because another kid in a basement made a video about it and uploaded it to Youtube (media). 
And to convince us sheeple he tells to search for yourself. Using the media. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:10:45
Transactions WITH a fee can be dead slow as well. Which is a big problem obviously. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:34:22
Oh right, you have some kind of secret shortcut where confirmations for you are instant while the rest of the world might be waiting for a hour.  That's awesome. Care to share it?
Edit: what insults??
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:48:35
See you next week when you're crying about the evil media talking bad about Bitcoin.

Wrong sub. Reported. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 03:57:47
Here we go again. 
Yes he is being charged with hiring a hitman trying to have someone killed. Stop spreading lies. It's completely crazy that all his fanboys think these charges were dropped because one idiot made that up here months ago. 
And then blaming the government for propaganda on top. It doesn't get more stupid. 
It's even on the FreeRoss site for you to read. Or is that suddenly propaganda as well now? 
Anyway it doesn't matter. As soon as you idiots find out those charges weren't dropped you will simply ignore it and continue supporting a wannabe murderer, drug dealer, money launderer....because you like drugs and he used Bitcoin. 
Edit: yeah bitches, just downvote it and make it all go away. Fuck facts and reality, right. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:02:11
How much time did you spent on using the search to find the same question answered about 300 times already?
@_date: 2014-07-06 06:45:30
So what? It's open source. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:38:28
So noone is allowed to create such coin because it would hurt the feelings of mussies?
@_date: 2014-07-10 00:54:33
Don't be so stupid. This is not bigger. Not even close. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:20:57
Stop it please. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:55:04
It is. It really is. 
And as a Bitcoin user i get associated with this scum. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 08:21:18
Please post the same thing 5 more times. We don't have enough reposts here. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:24:28
Yes i do. There is no Facebook and Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:20:07
They didn't implode. But someone who can't even create a username without grammar mistakes most likely won't understand this. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 11:06:08
Wow, looks like some upset Yahoo reader in downvoting everyone in this topic. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 20:07:32
Are you retarded? Serious question. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 00:49:51
Nope. He used Bitcoin so he should be free. Anything else gets downvoted. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:18:58
Congrats. You got your first scam mail. I got mine 15 years ago or so. Like the rest of the world. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 03:41:47
He used Bitcoin and sold drugs. That makes him a hero for 90% of the people here. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 08:26:08
You missed the part where a huge fucking plane entered the building and took out a few levels. You goddamn fucking retard!
@_date: 2014-07-06 06:05:28
This post is so retarded in more than 1 way. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 20:26:04
Man seriously, i think there about 200 topics about this subject already. Just use the search. That's why it's there. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:49:50
It is in the Maryland charges. Which always gets ignored here. I wonder why. Oh wait, supporting a wannabe murderer doesn't sound too nice. Better ignore that part. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:53:46
Ok, me a huge Bitcoin supporter, just made that up. For the fuck of it. Is that what you want to hear?
This is getting extremely stupid. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 06:11:12
So how are you gonna stop people from doing chargebacks after they got their coins?
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:14:25
A lot of people who just lost money by panic buying and selling will do it again right now. Can you believe that?

@_date: 2014-07-10 01:58:16
No, he didn't yell that you fucking retarded fuck. Stop getting your info from idiotic Youtube videos. Maybe it's time you learn some facts instead of the bullshit you've been fed by Alex Jones and your fellow slaves. 
A good place is to start here. Let me warn you. You'll enter a place called reality. It might shock you.

No, i don't think stealing is right. Neither in this case. I don't see why you assume i do because nowhere i even hint in that direction. 
All i'm saying is that if someone stole from me while i was stealing i would just shut up about it. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:59:08
And what about us who don't care about what you think is relevant to Bitcoin and are tired of seeing 2 dozen idiots here every day posting financial news?
Do you realize most people come here for Bitcoin news. If they wanted financial news they'd go somewhere else instead. 
You seem very arrogant and narcissistic. You come to a place that is given to you for free to talk about Bitcoin. And you tell the people who run it (and the readers) to fuck off because you do what you want. 
Why don't you start your own sub instead and fuck off from here?

Pretty much everyone knows about that building and how it was weakened by tons of debris from the other towers. That in combination with a huge fire made it go down. 
Again you look like a fucking retard. 
Really, it's not even worth discussing because we know exactly why it went down. There is mystery. 
Only Alex Jones slaves like you just trying to look for a conspiracy that isn't there. 
The details of how and why it went have been explained extensively in several rapports. There is no doubt, no mystery, no conspiracy. 
You on the other hand have no proof, no proof whatsover for anything that points to controlled demolition. 
The only thing you retarded kids have is ridiculous Youtube videos made by other retarded fucks like you. 
Wait, you hear that? It's your master Alex Jones calling his slaves. He has a new conspiracy ready. Quick, go spread it.

News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
What part about this rule don't you understand exactly? The thing is that 2 dozen people a day post non bitcoin related articles here because they think it's relevant. In the meantime this place is filled with non bitcoin crap i'm not interested in. And that's exactly why that rule exists. I don't care what you think is relevant. If i want financial news i'll go somewhere else. I'm here to read Bitcoin stuff.

If you have a sign on your door that says no salesmen yet every day some dude rings your doorbell and says although he did read the sign he thinks you really might like this product, are you gonna let him every day in or close the damn gate. 
Yes i said every day. Because every single day there are at least 10 people like you who think the rules don't apply to them because their post is important. 
The mods remove all those posts because they don't care what you consider important. They made a sign that says "no off topic posts here". That means, guess what, they don't want off topic posts here. 
Really man, you really aren't this important as you think you are. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 18:13:10
True. Let me put it this way though. The way things look now it has more reasons to go up than down.
People sold for months when we were in a bear market controlled by bad news, China FUD, Gox, etc. 
Things changed completely. There is no reason to sell anymore. Unless i'd really need the money there is no way i would sell even half a coin at this point.

You seriously think people are gonna donate to some random person who types like 15 year old?

Lets submit everything that doesn't mention to the Bitcoin sub. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:54:02
Lets downvote the fuck out of him because he asks a question :(
This sub...my God.

@_date: 2014-07-02 01:24:47
Yes. So did the 30 other people before you who posted this in the last 24 hours. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:20:48
Here you go kiddo.

Thanks for starting the 15th post about this. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 11:58:30
Exactly. All these points don't apply to people who don't run illegal shit. I wonder why the OP is so worried. 
The outcome of this doesn't affect me at all. Does it affect you, OP?
@_date: 2014-06-14 09:35:09
I love this gem:
And like the internet, the bubble will pop, and a lot of people will be very sad. Also, $1,000 as an easter present? Dang... I'd have been filthy rich by now off investments too!
Yeah, that obscure and silly thing called the internet crashed hard. Nobody uses it anymore. 
I'm sure that Einstein would've made tons with a 1000 dollar gift. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:09:05
Jesus man. Just look up the Maryland charges. It's all over the place. They weren't dropped. From day 1 he has been charged for attempted murder or something similar (i don't know the legal term). 
Just because a second charge in NY didn't use that specific charge doesn't mean it's dropped. 
How can something so simple be so difficult for Ulbricht supporters. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:37:18
Piss off with your spam!
@_date: 2014-07-07 01:14:28
I'm reporting this thread because it's off topic and ofcourse someone before you already posted it. 
Every day a dozen people do the same thing. "I know this doesn't belong here BUT....".
Every day people like you think they don't have to stick to the rules because their post is very important. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 20:06:55
So that's what i do with my internet money. I take it offline. 
I've been doing it wrong this whole time.

People who do that always think they are more important than others. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:42:42
Yes, but panic buyers and sellers like you won't be the people making money. You're just noise on a forum. Nothing more. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 05:28:31
He faces 8.5 years max and the charges for the link sharing were dropped. How about you post real titles instead of click bait. 
I'm still trying to figure out what the 3 charges that are left are for. But it seems quite hard to figure out. I wonder why. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:04:10
Yes. 50 idiots before you posted the same thing and wondered if anyone else got one. 
Next time when you have a question why don't you use the damn search instead?
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:47:48
Wth? So now i get downvoted to hell? What's wrong with you people?
This guy makes a good, on topic comment and gets downvoted. I wonder why he possibly gets downvoted and that is enough reason for people to "punish" me. 
This voting system on Reddit might not be the best solution of whatever they try to achieve with it. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 12:36:41
We know. Because it's already been posted. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 12:20:43
You are worried about hackers and drug traffickers and money launderers? Why?
If you stay away from this shit they will have nothing to charge you with. What is the problem exactly?
@_date: 2014-07-07 08:50:18
We know. Half a dozen people before you posted this non bitcoin news.

We're all heavy intellects when stoned. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 12:39:14
Right, because you decide who is allowed to use Bitcoin and who not. I'm sure blocking certain users is exactly what Satoshi had in mind when he created Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:43:43
Explain to me why you think there is anyone here who can answer that. This is a honest question. I'd love to understand people asking these questions. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 04:21:29
Hilarious how you and i get downvoted for telling the truth and the guy above us spreading lies gets upvoted. It says a lot about the mental state of all these druggies here. What a way to live.

You really don't have to worry about any of those (very weird?) things as mining is a complete waste of money.

Oh and one guy calling it bullshit because you can't take it to the bank. 
Yes sir, not needing a bank anymore is the whole point of this thing. 
Unbelievable how people are so brainwashed into thinking money can only be used if a bank is involved. Banks exists for one reason only and that is to make money off of you. But i guess that's how he prefers things. Sad world we live in. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:39:09
No those charges weren't dropped you dumb idiot. I wish you morons would stop spreading false facts. 
Unbelievable how 90% of the stoners in this place believe they were dropped because some other dumb stoner once mentioned this here.

Even on their official donation site they mentioned this isn't case.

@_date: 2014-07-08 04:23:59
Funny how you got downvoted. Typical Bitcoin users. "We will be at 10k by next year and anything else gets downvoted". 
@_date: 2014-07-10 11:37:56
Stop posting non Bitcoin news to the Bitcoin sub. Maybe that helps. 
Edit: it's in fucking German! 
So you post German non-bitcoin news and ask to spam the comments. And you wonder why the mods delete it. Are you retarded?
@_date: 2014-07-15 12:57:00
Stop posting titles in caps. It's annoying. 
And i just can't feel sorry anymore for people buying from these companies. You people never learn.

@_date: 2014-07-06 22:45:01
Actually yes they are going after him for trying to have people killed. 
Someone mentioned on Reddit this charge was dropped so all the simpletons here right away assumed that is true. Which it isn't. 
And it's irrelevant if he made 100's of millions or 10 bucks? You people are completely fucking retarded and out of reality. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:37:30
To support someone who tried to have people killed. 
You know that the rest of the world doesn't share your views right?
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:47:15
Who is the next allegedly drug trafficker, money launderer and murderer  we are gonna support?
@_date: 2014-07-12 11:40:09
Nobody cares what you think or feel. You really don't get it?
If everybody starts posting random news they feel is relevant then this place will turn to shit. And you are exactly such a person.

As soon as you read the word "sheeple" you know you're dealing with a retarded conspiracy theorist. 
They always tell us to wake up and open your eyes. When you ask why and how they will refer you to Google and Youtube. 
Also the full caps and !!!111 will tell you what kind of person we're dealing with here.

50 people posted it before. When will you idiots learn to use the search!
@_date: 2014-06-25 10:45:30
meaning it would likely be banked into a trust account for the state.
Are you trying to spread fud with your title or just trying to sound interesting?
@_date: 2014-06-25 12:13:02
People who ask people on Reddit what to do with their money are usually not the type of people that should be investing. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:16:43
Maybe because everyone is fucking tired of it. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:27:07
Actually no we didn't. There was no evidence whatsoever that Cyprus had anything to do with Bitcoin going up. It was at the same time and people simply assumed it was connected. Somehow this turned into a fact for a lot of people.

There are 100 thousands of drug dealers in jail world wide. Why don't you support them?
Fact is any other random drug dealer/money launderer who made 100's of millions and tried to have several people killed wouldn't get a penny from you idiots. Because they didn't use Bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-06-18 08:34:12
Yes indeed. It's about 8 days in new coins that caused the panic. Idiots. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 14:53:07
Cold storage is for people who want to hold and not gamble. These investments are extremely risky. Scam after scam. Using them defeats the purpose of having a cold wallet. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:26:03
The alleged excuse. Was waiting for it. It funny how that works here. When a banker would be in jail for alleged financial crimes you druggies would scream as loud as possible to hang him by the balls from the highest tree without trial. But when it's your druggie hero then it's alleged. Innocent until proven guilty. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:46:12
I find it hard to believe that 13 years later there are still imbeciles who think explosives were planted in the towers. Really fucking hard to believe. You'd need to have such a low iq to believe that that i doubt you're able to turn on a computer in the first place. 
Then again, your username...

No, you are not the first to post this. How could you possibly think you are?
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:30:19
And of course the typical conspiracy tard tactic. Conspiracy tard makes a ridiculous claim without any proof and tells others to disprove him or he is right. No retard, you make the claim, you show us proof. That's how it works in the real world where the grown ups hang. 
Do you idiots ever notice you all act the same? All you conspiracy morons are like little clones. Exactly the same moronic behavior! Seriously, do you people see this at all?
@_date: 2014-07-14 03:53:51
Learn a lesson from it. Don't run drug market places and try to have people killed. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 12:47:32

You realize you're full of shit right?
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:50:06
I'm just tired of idiots posting non Bitcoin news all day long. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:33:00
He also tried to have people killed. But who cares about those small details right. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:59:59
People donating to that guy are insane. 
And all this because he uses Bitcoin. 
There are tons of drug dealers in jail. But they didn't use Bitcoin so nobody gives a shit. 
The guy broke the law. Like really bad. Tried to have people killed. Made 100's of millions. And people donate to him because he used Bitcoin. Infuckingsane. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:00:29
Thanks. We had no idea. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 06:43:58
Just the usual clueless nonsense. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 07:48:01
You know what's fucking ironic? That all you druggies are blaming the media for talking bullshit while the only thing i've seen the media do is simply report about the case based on the facts they had. And 90% of those same people are clueless about the facts and spread lies in every thread about this guy. 
For the 100th time the hitman charges weren't dropped! 
The only reason why all of you idiot think that is because some druggie posted that here a few months ago. And because it perfectly fitted your Ross is innocent fantasy world everybody believed it without questioning.
Yet the media gets the blame all fucking day. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 01:12:13
Yes, a whole country gets screwed over. Awesome news. As long as your 2 bitcoins get worth more right? Disgusting. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 23:33:54
One individual?
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:12:21
Yes, everyone who doesn't agree with your cultist behavior is a troll. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:25:38
Sure it does. Lets produce some more bad news. The price will sky rocket. 
Strong stuff you are smoking at the moment i guess?
@_date: 2014-06-28 04:36:27
I have a feeling you can't be much older than 16 yourself. 
You don't make any sense whatsoever.
I know what usenet is. I probably used it when you were still sucking your momma's titties. 
Usenet is absolutely filled with cracked software and copyrighted porn.
It's exactly why it's not a "kiddie torrent site". So your argument actually confirms what i was saying. Which i guess you won't understand anyway. 
He admitted he was looking for porn. And i think we can be quite sure it's porn that was not shot to be distributed for free. 
And i don't give a shit if he downloads that shit 24/7. I just think he has little right to complain shit got stolen from him. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 13:17:00
Don't worry I don't think anyone would mistake you for one. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:54:03
You will get downvoted to hell. This place is filled with government hating drug using teenagers who consider money launderer, hacker, wannabe murderer, drug trafficker Ulbricht a true hero. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 17:44:55
Get over it man. Sweet Jesus.
You submitted a non Bitcoin post to a Bitcoin sub and a mod removed it. That's the task of mods. 
If you don't want that to happen then submit it to some news sub or something. 
Every sub has rules. Rules are there for a reason. In this case to keep this sub on topic. The mod did an excellent job and it's just retarded that it upsets you so much. You were not being censored. They removed an off topic post. It's that simple. And the voting system is here to up or downvote Bitcoin topics. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:28:02
All these new members are bots. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 11:15:34
You posted this already. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:42:24
Thanks. My reply would be pretty much identical. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 17:50:29
This isn't censorship you idiot! Your post was removed because it had nothing to do with Bitcoin! My God, this is getting more stupid by the minute! What's wrong with you! How can you not understand this!
@_date: 2014-08-03 07:44:25
He is talking about Bitcoin obviously. I'm pretty sure you were aware of that. 
Edit: now i remember who you are. Mr "Cypress". The dumb stoner teen who cheers when countries go to shit because he thinks he will become a millionaire with the half a coin he owns. 
The world finances expert who can't even spell a country's name correctly. Let alone point it out on a map. 
That explains this topic. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 04:08:46
There are millions of murderers and drug traffickers who are innocent until proven guilty sitting in jail world wide. When are you gonna donate to them?
@_date: 2014-06-25 10:45:59

@_date: 2014-07-02 02:41:22
We know. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:51:18
No, sadly that's not the case. 
I can buy something online now with my bank card, instantly, with no fee. Please stop denying this. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 20:21:16
We know. Please just stop. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 06:02:26
Just one example. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 05:49:48
Yeah. In the next thread they will be crying how bad the media talks about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 12:28:18
So now please answer me. Why is it so obvious?
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:58:53
IYes, great story. Yet i can buy stuff instantly with my credit card while with Bitcoin i might have to wait a hour. 
But there is nothing wrong with Bitcoin, right?
Edit: i'm a customer. Not a merchant. Not sure why you try to change the subject. 
It seems as if people here will do anything to deny Bitcoin's confirmation times are really bad. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 04:28:40
Just stop it man. Obvious troll is obvious. Really, just stop it. 
For those who don't get it yet. He and thelurker4u are the same person. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 08:50:36
Yet you still post it here. 
Good idea man. Lets post all news items that don't mention Bitcoin in a Bitcoin Reddit. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:28:43
You are 15 right?
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:14:35
You just made that up because you couldn't give me a real answer, didn't you?
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:27:39
Do you feel stupid yet? Reality slapping you in the face and all that. 
Just light another joint, downvote my comment and it's like it never happened. 
Then you can safely scream and cry in the next topic how he was never charged with it. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:06:52
You are 15 right?
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:56:36
So no proof of anything i take it? I'm so surprised. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 11:11:32
We know. Really we know. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 12:02:59
Toseef D just had a doobie break i think. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 03:48:36
Yes he was charged with it.

Wrong sub. Reported. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:38:39
So the dozens of warnings not to use them in combination with Bitcoin weren't for you?
@_date: 2014-07-14 12:18:57
It's obvious? Really? Why exactly?
@_date: 2014-07-07 12:42:46
Sure. I believe that right away. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:02:56
Yes we know. 10 people before you posted it already.

@_date: 2014-07-07 13:02:54
Huh what?
@_date: 2014-07-09 08:22:18
Yeah, i'm sure that was worth a downvote.

Give me a fucking break. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:05:01
My bank account: i can buy something online or in a store, instantly, without fees. 
Yes, i want Bitcoin to replace banks but no i don't want to wait 30 mins for 1 or more confirmations to buy a tv in a store. 
But just downvote it and it will go away. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:52:16
But it's not a problem with Bitcoin right?
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:11:16
Actually it's mainly Americans who can't spell lose/loose. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:26:44
That's what you get for running a huge drugs exchange and trying to have people killed. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 12:55:54
Jesus fucking Christ! FOR THE 100th fucking time they weren't dropped you goddamn retard!
Read it again and again! THEY WEREN'T DROPPED! How fucking hard can it be to get this in your thick fucking skulls!
They were not dropped. Not dropped. Read that till you understand it you fucking moron!
@_date: 2014-07-14 12:06:24
When you try to have people killed you aren't a terrible criminal?
It's crazy how everybody just keeps ignoring this. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:23:45
It's also funny how you think he solved drug wars. You think all those sellers produced their own stash? Stop smoking for a minute and get a clue. Not 1 cartel was less violent because of a seller on Silk Road.

"How can i make money?"

Here we go again. The msm have something new to go nuts on. 
For another 3 months people will tell me how Bitcoin recently got hacked and how it's a scam. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:56:02
I come here for Bitcoin news. Not to downvote non Bitcoin news. If i want financial news i go somewhere else. This seems hard for you to understand. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 20:07:46
People still believe this myth?
@_date: 2014-07-14 12:59:47
Get your facts straight. You'll look less stupid. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 07:57:53
You act like the people of this sub are one group of nice, smart people with plenty of money and willing to work together. They're not. 
This is a place full of trolls, scammers, broke ass kids, delusional freaks and what not. 
So no, your little plan won't work. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 21:36:02
Miners are absolute morons. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 04:39:46
They didn't drop it. They are charging him for the hitman thing. 
Months ago 1 druggie here said they dropped it (which was a lie) and since then all the other druggies keep repeating the same nonsense. 
How about you stop spreading false facts. 
How am i a troll? Because i say things you don't like?
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:46:07
Stop acting like a 12 year old. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 05:21:45
I've rarely seen a group of people so gullible as Bitcoiners. It's like they live in a completely different reality. 
Anybody who is critical of Bitcoin is a banker shill and anybody who is pro Bitcoin always speaks the truth. No exceptions.

The IRS must be really worried about a few people finding 20 bucks. Great article.

@_date: 2014-07-14 13:29:37
It doesn't matter. If he gets convicted you people won't accept it anyway and call the evidence fake and what not. So please give me a break with this innocent until proven guilty bs.

He can't reveal his sources obviously. Like every troll here.

You cry a lot. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 17:51:16
You're talking about a huge problem that simply gets ignored and downvoted. It's Bitcoin's number one issue and you're not allowed to mention it here. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:33:06
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
What part about this rule don't you understand exactly?
The thing is that 2 dozen people a day post non bitcoin related articles here because they think it's relevant. In the meantime this place is filled with non bitcoin crap i'm not interested in. And that's exactly why that rule exists. 
I don't care what you think is relevant. 
If i want financial news i'll go somewhere else. I'm here to read Bitcoin stuff. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:35:45

@_date: 2014-06-14 16:49:25
No idea why you are getting downvoted. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 07:40:01
Yes we got it the first 10 times it was posted already. What is it with this place and the endless amounts of reposts?
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:25:16
Ok good for you. You have a valid reason. 
Now i wonder why the 3000 other people are so desperate to know the price. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:41:27
You were talking about cartels you dumb stoner idiot. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:07:01
Stop posting stuff that doesn't belong here you idiots. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:45:25
Anybody who's selling something that's let's say 500 dollar or higher will want at least 1 confirmations. In the near future this could be 10.000's of cases a day. 
But it's no problem that many of these people will have to wait 30 minutes in a store for a payment to go through. Is that correct? 
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:37:35
"It also sold forgeries, hacking tools, stolen Paypal accounts, and credit/debit card numbers". And a money launderer and a wannabe murderer. The hero of Evoorhees and many other bitcoiners. 
In the next topic we will see the same people crying about the evil media and how they make Bitcoin look bad. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 09:54:49
Holy downvotes Batman. Looks like someone is butt hurt. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:26:57
No. Only straight people. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 08:57:29
Wrong place for common sense. A drug trafficker who uses Bitcoin is as good as it gets for the druggies here. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:08:58
First of all there is no proof whatsoever that "Cypress" did anything to the Bitcoin price. It was/is just another case of wishful thinking which happens a lot there. If you can show me otherwise then feel free to do so. 
And second i'd like to hear your opinion on this rule made by the mods:
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
And why they remove such posts.

You trolls just make up anything you can think of to attack Bitcoin. You people are so retarded. 
And i love the to be honest part. As if the creator of Bitcoin told you this secret. 
And also it doesn't even make sense whatsoever. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:58:37
Nop, absolutely no ponzi. Why would anybody get that idea. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:08:30
Most likely?
No. 
It's an extremely obvious troll. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:01:31
You and i got downvoted after the person we replied to removed his message. 
People are idiots.

Goodbye, and good luck to the next sub that has to deal with you.

Let me repeat that for you. I can buy something with my bank card in a store or online, instantly, with no fees. 
With Bitcoin it might take a very long time. With fees. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:23:34
I knew someone would bring this up. And without shooting the messenger, it's just such a stupid and outdated "rule". 
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:21:35

Yes we fucking know!
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:11:23
And i like how you tell us what law is legit and what not. 
Let me guess, you're a druggie.
All you Ulbricht supporters have 2 things in common. You use or used drugs and live in some kind of idiotic anarchistic fantasy land. 
Edit: one more thing you have in common. Most of you are really young. Did some drugs and think you figured the world out. It doesn't work that way. You will find out one day. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 12:34:31
We know. Because it's on top of the mainpage and 10 other people before you posted it. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 07:54:02
Right, he provided 100's of illegal drug dealers a place to sell their drugs and other illegal items and take a cut of every transaction. 
That's perfectly fine. He should be a free man. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 10:34:23
Yes we know. Because it's posted 10 times already over the last 3 days. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:04:42
Guess what. You're not the first to post this. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 22:40:16
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 03:17:49
I just think it's funny that someone who is stealing is upset someone stole from him. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 04:31:35
Yes, i realize that. In the meantime stop spreading propaganda that it was dropped. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:16:11
Wait, so you come up with a ridiculous claim with no source that makes no sense whatsoever and tell me i should disprove it because otherwise you are correct?
I actually hope you are trolling and not being serious. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:33:35
It's off topic and doesn't belong here. 
I don't care what you think is relevant. If i want general financial news i'll go somewhere else. I come here for Bitcoin news.

People have been posting this daily for a week already. Will you people ever learn to check before posting?

@_date: 2014-07-01 10:27:18
No. Nobody. You are the first to post this. 
No wait, 5 other people before you already posted this including the last post before this one. I bet you searched hard before submitting this to make sure you weren't number because everyone is sick and tired of these reposts all day, right?
@_date: 2014-07-14 05:14:06
Still nothing? Just a lot of hot air. 
As always with the druggies in these kinda threads. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:11:44
I told you to stop. It's so obvious. With every reply you look more stupid. 
You think you're so smart you made up this plan with 2 usernames and a deleted post but once again it's so fucking obvious. Like 3 seconds to figure it out. 
You're simply not smart enough to pull this off. Give it up. 
Edit: You're so fucking dumb you couldn't even change the writing style on one of the accounts. Stupid fucking kid.

Sure. And i can call you an idiot. Amazing this freedom we have right. 
You come here telling us what we should do with our coins (because you made a bad decision) and you get your panties in a bunch when people reply to you. 
As someone else mentioned you look like a scared little kid.

Lets ignore he tried to have people murdered. Doesn't fit well in this beautiful anarchist story right?
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:42:05
Awesome, let's show the whole world how the Bitcoin community supports drug traffickers, money launderers and wannabe murderers. Just awesome. 
It's really what Bitcoin needs at this moment. Can't wait to see the news articles coming week. 
I can't wait to explain my skeptical friends and family that Bitcoin really isn't a drug currency.

Edit: and after i posted this they started upvoting you so they can downvote me. Yup, that's Reddit for ya. This is how the nerds and other socially retarded teens "punish" people on the internet. 
People who virtually downvote people on the internet should really take a moment to think over their life and find out where it all went wrong. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 11:54:53
Experts. Bitcoin experts. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:04:40
No. But of course you only talk like this when it's a Bitcoin druggie god. 
If this would be about a banker you'd yell to hang him by the balls without a trial. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 12:41:48
I'm sure you have evidence for that, right. I mean only a retard would post something like this without evidence. And you're not a retard right?
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:12:32
Sure. In fantasy land. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 19:12:16
The pump is ltcx? Wtf is that?
@_date: 2014-07-12 00:25:36
I'm serious. You should work on your grammar instead of spreading the word on Bitcoin hoping your 0.2 coins are gonna make you rich. 
Nobody will take you serious in life when you type like this. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 20:47:24
16 year old conspiracy theorists need lots of attention. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 02:17:10
"Ur". How old are you? 12?
@_date: 2014-06-18 06:26:17
Please stop posting news from 3 days ago. We got it the first 20 times it was posted. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:47:07
He is right. You are a moron. And i also find it hard to believe you are not trolling. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 07:47:00
What does this have to do with Gox??
@_date: 2014-07-13 12:20:23
No. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:34:19
We know. 10 other people already posted it. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:53:49
Why don't you tell me instead considering you started this topic. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:27:42
Just like every druggie here is absolutely sure he is innocent. My assumptions are based on what he is charged with. The druggies their assumptions that he is innocent is based on that they like drugs and Bitcoin. 
All this innocent until proven stuff you people keep repeating doesn't matter anyway. Because if he gets convicted you will say the evidence was faked. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:47:50
You're so anarchistic man! Fuck society!
@_date: 2014-07-09 10:08:16
Yes, it must be the Chinese signing up here. They are known for visiting English forums. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 12:45:08
Stop please. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:50:02
How is this a story in the first place. An anon person on some obscure blog wrote some extremist jibberish. This is all it takes to make headlines. Sad. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 12:54:48
One month old news?
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:09:18
Ah. Fresh China fud. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 08:49:01
Stop posting all your titles in full caps you moron. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 22:38:23
Yes you idiot. The 50 people before you who posted it. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 10:37:08
Any day i can avoid my money being in the hands of banksters is a good day. That alone is enough for me to use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 21:19:32
Stop it please. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 00:19:28
People who type "ur" can't be older than 12. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:22:35
Read, you fucking idiot, read!
@_date: 2014-07-09 06:04:20
Shouldn't you be praying or something? Aren't you supposed to be a good muslim?
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:56:25
We had no idea. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:53:20
Yes you did. But you removed it. 
Why don't you go spam your shit somewhere else. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 20:19:01
For every person to make money another person loses money obviously. 
Idiots buying at the top will lose money. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:06:53
Idiots like you will always end up losing money. Take your mining adventure as a hint. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 10:43:50
We know. 30 people before you posted it already. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 16:40:26
Your post has nothing to do with Bitcoin and doesn't belong here. And it seems the mods agree with me as you can see in the rules section on your right. But that doesn't apply to you right?
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:57:46
Thanks for reposting a repost. Because we don't have enough reposts yet. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 04:24:18
No. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 08:19:44
I love how you put "bitcoin related" already in the title. 
Like the rules don't apply to you because you say it's related. Which it isn't by the way. 
Reported. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 21:33:01
Kids like you don't own shit. People with money don't post crap like this. 
You consider yourself rich because you think 12 months from now your 2 coins will be worth tons. 
That's not how things work. You will learn this when you grow up. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:31:01
CAN YOU SHOUT SOME MORE!
@_date: 2014-07-24 09:15:15
No. Hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:22:41
Faked. By the media, obviously. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:02:28
This shit is so bad for Bitcoin. But this place is filled with druggies who think Ulbricht is some kind of god. They don't understand the situation and how Roger Ver is an idiot. They are stoned and all they can say is "cool dude". 
@_date: 2014-07-17 22:12:39
They don't want your money. Get the hint. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:42:46
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:41:16
If this, if that. 
The thing is people like you don't actually make money. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 02:59:52
Trying to have people killed is ok as long as you pay in Bitcoin /bitcoinuser. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 12:54:12
Stop reposting. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:07:25
You have a drug problem, don't you? I don't think one needs to be a doctor to see that you are extremely mentally unstable. 
I seriously wonder if you see this yourself. You're a lunatic conspiracy theorist because your brains don't work the way they should. It also causes you to be very narcissistic. Which is common for conspiracy theorists. But this also prevents you from admitting you have mental problems. Either way, it's kinda sad. 
I've seen 12 year olds more smart and stable than you. Think about it. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 12:58:54
That username hehe.
@_date: 2014-06-30 09:30:47
50% based on what? 
Sorry, your post is total nonsense. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 02:15:28
Stop. Please. Just stop. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 17:26:50
I don't know about the 2nd post but you are crying about a non Bitcoin post being removed from a Bitcoin sub? Really? Even after the mods wrote a specific rule that such topics don't belong here? C'mon, you can't be that ignorant. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 05:15:16
Yeah, just downvote it and it will go away. All these stupid things like reality and facts. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 04:50:53
Yes we know. Because, guess what, half a dozen people already posted it. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:25:16
Stop the fucking reposts man. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 15:10:51
Please report it. Many of us are tired of these people spamming this sub with general financial news all day long. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 03:47:24
He tried to have people killed. Do you like murderers??
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:18:10
Wrong sub. Reported.

Banking shills. You have to be kidding me. You don't truly believe that do you?
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:39:33
Take a moment to read back this and your other replies and realize how it looks for sane people. Really, try it. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 08:49:40
That's New York you fucking idiot! He's also being charged in Maryland. Is everybody really that fucking clueless or what??
@_date: 2014-07-14 05:16:45
I get downvoted because of what exactly?
@_date: 2014-06-20 18:20:12
Typing in caps won't get you your coins back. It will only annoy people. Shouting on the internet is silly. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 04:25:19
"We can all just conclude it was all bullshit". 
Because you don't like it or do you have some real reasons. Can't wait for your answer. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:23:49
We know. It was posted about 20 times a week ago. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:23:53
I'm sure you searched to see this has been asked and answered 200 times already. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 10:26:46
The rules don't apply to you. Are you special?
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:10:46
I was waiting for this. Funny how this is always brought up when it's about him. But when a politician or a banker or really anyone who doesn't use Bitcoin is charged with something then you never hear anyone saying this. Hypocrite much?
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:18:17
Ok i suggest you sell everything thing. What are you waiting for?
@_date: 2014-07-14 08:53:31
Right, i meant someone who hired someone else to kill. Which is perfectly fine ofcourse. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 15:42:11
After you use the search. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:00:50
As much as i love Bitcoin and hate banks, i can buy stuff instantly with my bank card or credit card. With Bitcoin i might have to wait 30 minutes or longer. 
But yeah, just downvote me and act like it isn't a problem. That's the way to solve things in Bitcoin land. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:47:34
Aaaaand nothing. Just another conspiracy druggie moron talking out of his ass. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:27:32
We know. Others before you posted this off topic news that doesn't belong here. Reported.

The rules don't apply to you right? Are you special?
@_date: 2014-06-11 18:07:34
I can smell the hurt through my screen.
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:29:20
Sure. This world would be better without schools. So we can all be anarchistic worthless stoners like you. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:36:22
This isn't just curiosity. People act as if the future of Bitcoin depends on it. 
Notice above how that person mentioned that it has to be done. No matter what we need to know the price. 
Why? That's something he can't answer. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:30:58
Ok. So i should just wait 30 minutes for the transaction to go through and keep telling that no matter what, it's absolutely not a problem with Bitcoin. It's is not a core problem that it might take 30 minutes minutes for a confirmation. 
Thanks man, that solved everything. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 00:03:27
I responded to the topic title. I don't read trash like Infowars. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 01:16:11
You know what's worse than reposts? Reposts in all caps. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:09:40
These posts....
Stop them. Please!
And ffs can one person here use the correct word for once: affect. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 12:16:45
Calm down everyone and let the experts do the talking please. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 07:54:45
Ofcourse you don't agree. You love drugs so Ross is your hero and innocent. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:13:37
The thing is no matter what happens people like you will find an excuse. 
He's being charged with it but not found guilty yet. When he's found guilty of this charge you will simply say it was fake, a set up or some other idiotic conspiracy theory. That's how you people roll. 
Anthing goes really. Because he was a Bitcoin user. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 07:21:35
Only idiots who want to lose their money buy these miners. 
They fall for it again and again. I can hardly feel sorry for them that they get screwed over again. I stay away from these companies and as a result don't get fucked over. It's quite easy. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:42:35
Already posted 3 times. When will you people learn to look before posting. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:27:38
C'mon man. We're talking about the transaction itself. 
I can play this game too. Your Bitcoin transaction is even more expensive because you sent a wire to Coinbase from your bank account which also costs you money just to own one. 
You realize how silly this is right? We're talking about transactions. So i'm gonna repeat it again. With my bank card i can buy something instantly with no fees. 
It really is quite amazing to see you people come up with the most ridiculous stuff just so you can deny that the confirmation times are a problem. It's very religion like. Kinda messed up. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 18:00:35
That's funny you mention a circle jerk by the way. Your post and most of the other off topic posts are usually posted for 1 reason: to create a Bitcoin circle jerk. 
Country x has financial problems - Bitcoin user not affected - Fap fap fap. 
That's how it goes 9 out of 10 times with these posts. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 03:52:09
Sorry but that is completely retarded. 
Just don't run a site that is used to buy and sell drugs. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:51:01
We know. It's on top of the mainpage and posted every 15 minutes.

What censorship?

Just downvote it. And it suddenly won't be fake anymore.

Here is an idea. Stop spamming your Spanish language blog here every day you idiot!
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:18:06
Here is an idea. Why don't you find the answer in one of the 70 existing topics with exactly the same question. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:44:46
Yes. We got it the first time you posted it. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:25:45
We know. Because it's already been posted. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 02:44:26
There are tons of drug dealers in jail. But nobody here gives a shit about them. They didn't use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 06:25:32
Someone pulls some facts out of his ass and the rest of you just upvote it. So typical of this sub. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:32:44
So did the 30 people before you who posted this. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:21:22
Fucking retard. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:08:46
The Bitcoin brand?
@_date: 2014-07-14 03:49:45
That poor drugs dealer. The government should've just passively watched instead. This is so not fair!
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:18:05
Yes they did you fucking retard! It's even posted on the freeross site. Are you idiots completely fucking stupid or what?
@_date: 2014-07-08 04:10:13
But he used Bitcoin so it's all good. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:47:45
And then? How is that gonna change anything if you know who owns those coins?
@_date: 2014-07-12 12:27:28
Sounds like he simply has no clue what he is talking about. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:30:16
Jesus Christ. You stoners are so goddamn fucking sad. 
Grow up man. Just admit you were wrong and you acted stupid. Like a man. People will respect you way more for it. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:47:58
Extremely weak phrase. Sorry. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:39:58
So everyone who buys something more expensive is gonna be forced to use 3rd party cards. 
But it's noooooooo problem. No matter what the slow transaction time is no problem. Really, no problem at all. Impossible that it is a problem. Right?
