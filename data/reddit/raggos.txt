If people want to read news, then they will do so. This is a FORUM...not a news spam outlet. If you consider what you're doing usefull then you are missing the point of this forum. By endless posts the genuine real discussion can be pushed out in favour of sensational posts (irregardless of what they are)...
Hence, post quality, write, ask, not just links.

My knowledge of BTC is too basic/intermediate to have relevant significance to post, i ask my questions on other places. If you don't see you're part of a propaganda machine, then so be it. Atleast moderate in what you post at least. 
Avoid the irrelevant doomsday BTC posts, if you do post, atleast do this forum this favour. Regurgitating bullshit is to no-ones benefit.

When you think about it, not much is different from the homeless shouting: "DOOMSDAY 2012!" to these people saying bitcoin has failed.
Quick search behind shows it's very likely a bot for news or basically news driven publishing person. Bollocks...ban

After reading the comments I've come to the conclusion this is propaganda &amp;or shill attempt. 
OP has no concrete analysis as well, poor post. To the un-indoctrinated &amp; blockchain-un-educated this has no value. 
"50BTC Companies from x countries now bla bla bla...." What are you, Ripple (

Can you not open an account in, say Swiss, trade with your BTC with it, and when needing a deposit, using the Swiss -&gt; Aussie tx?
