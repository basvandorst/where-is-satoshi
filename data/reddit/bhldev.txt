Except "free market" doesn't mean zero government interference. In fact, government can help keep the market more free, for example by forcing banks not to take race into consideration for loans. "Cronyism" doesn't just mean lobbying government. It can mean, using all the money and power and influence, to influence friends and powerful people who can then use their money to distort the real free market.
Face it "crony capitalism" as a phrase is here to stay. It's not a redefinition, it's always existed say as robber barons or industrialists or oligarchs or any number of derisory terms to refer to people with a lot of money who use their money for politics or to step on the little guy. So don't worry plenty of phrases and words people use to tarnish capitalism lol. If you want to go back to ancient times you can too.


Our agreement is superficial. I would probably agree to giving an advantage to a disabled person or say a war veteran who lost both legs. You might not. I would give an advantage to single moms. You probably wouldn't. Yes government gets to pick losers and winners sometimes, too bad. Just the way it works to create a type of society everyone wants to live in (except libertarians). Enjoy the Trump years he's the closest you will get before the old conservative order takes power back.

Under what system was the greatest economic growth and technological innovation of mankind under? That's right Keynesianism and fiat money.
Bitcoin is deflationary because it doesn't replace the lost or destroyed coins. I don't go by theory or invention I go by what I see in front of me and the result (with an honorable mention for intent). 
I sympathize with the intent (prevent bailouts and too big to fail, give money back to the little guy) but only so far which is why I am here and I support Bitcoin as an asset. But as a money? No way.
By now you have figured out what side of the fence I stand... In fact it's worse than that, not to be a troll or start a flame war but I do believe Ben Bernanke saved Western Civilization as we know it. People do not understand how bad it could have gotten in 2008. Anyway I will not convince you and you will not convince me, so take care ��

Bank bailouts were paid back or made a lot of money for the government.
Banks go bankrupt, companies can't make payroll, chain reaction = Great Depression.

The problem with your hypothesis is every single time they increase interest rates or "print money" say with 2008 bank bailout inflation does not increase more than usual on average. What that means is only money in motion or money on the move or money in the market contributes to real inflation. Zimbabwe-type money printing is unlikely because guess what, voters would eviscerate them.
This is a fact you cannot argue with... If so-called manipulation does not create real inflation, it is meaningless.
Meanwhile Mt. Gox whale, dumped 8500 bitcoins? Not direct manipulation? Give me a break. That's as direct as it gets. And he is just a tiny whale. If anything you should argue that Bitcoin has direct manipulation, fiat has indirect manipulation. Just direct sounds more "evil" so you plucked it out of your ass, sorry.
Given all the facts no rational voter or economic actor would give up 40% or more of their purchasing power to "early adopters". If they want crypto they would probably go for a FedCoin or some kind of government backed crypto. Anyway good luck to all of us.

Your "programming" is libertarian programming. You look at the word "free" in "free market" and think a whole bunch of things, none of which have anything to do with money exchanging hands or goods and services being bought. The "free" in "free market" doesn't mean American Apple Pie freedom but can mean a whole bunch of evil, evil kept in check by traditions, social norms and yes even government.
This "use of force" or "coercion" is a legal fiction, invented by libertarians... worse than a legal fiction because lawyers would not support that definition as force. Yes you are "forced" to pay taxes you can also quit the country and not pay tax.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:43:47
They don't print, by any definition, double the money every 25 years. That should give you enough pause to question your "printing money" mental model. The causes are complex and things are more expensive.
Money is not supposed to "gain value" over time, that creates a tax on all late and later adopters just because they came later. Sounds great except it fucks people born later too, out of no fault of their own. If you want to be selfish and have an anemic economy or no economic growth, deflation is the way to go. People have money to buy Bitcoin right now because 2008 didn't turn into a Great Depression and they have jobs with the economy booming. Most small business make 5-15% and small business make most jobs. Tell me what incentive would those with money have to invest in business if you could say, get even a few percent increase guaranteed a year? Absolutely none. Dead economy. No thanks.

"Crony capitalism" is capitalism with rules and regulations that favor the rich instead of giving everyone an equal playing field. For most this means giving the rich a lesser tax rate. This is what Warren Buffet is against.
I understand his concern... Bitcoin is just switching one group of cronies for another. Which is why I hope that it stays an asset like gold forever and not a currency. Because the wealth distribution of Bitcoin would make most people poorer than Somalians. Early adopters win, late ones fucked. I think it is still early enough to get in but only just barely.
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:06:12
Where do you come up with this idea of "direct" or "indirect"? Federal Reserve Board is people. Whales, are people. Not seeing a difference, lol.
Half the reason to buy Bitcoin is to fleece people like you. I hope you hodl forever and keep believing what you believe, for my sake, lol. Take care and good luck to us all.
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:55:41
It generally means tax rates or regulations for the rich or corporate welfare. Buffet is a liberal not a libertarian which will put him against most Bitcoin afficanios but he is definitely a capitalist not crony capitalist. You can definitely be a crony capitalist, because money makes more money if you can bribe politcians, hide your money with expensive accountants and so on. All that is voluntary but crony because the little guy doesn't have the money or power to change the rules or take advantage of the rules like that.
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:54:34
Buffet was an unwilling participant. He's on record as saying it's unfair his secretary pays a higher tax rate than he does.
Also depends what you mean by average guy. Average guy who holds say 50-80% of their savings in an indexed fund, will have made a killing. Average person with 0 investments only wages, will be behind and have a "lost decade". 
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:41:03


It's not an illusion or story, it is a fact it was paid back and made a lot of money. Maybe next time it won't and maybe it shouldn't have happened but that's all maybes. It's not about creating wealth, it's about dealing with reality.
Buying time is all that matters in a crisis. Like it or not, loans and payroll are how business work. Come up with an alternative model that actually works then we can talk.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:28:39
Yes, really. The reason is there are many kinds of force, implicit, explicit. 
If a person's risk tolerance is +/- 10% and a bunch of whales can sell and buy their own coin (illegal in fiat) that is forcing them to sell based on inaccurate information... is the market really dropping or is it insider trading? You can say force is only wage garnishing or imprisonment or barrel of a gun and Bitcoin does not do that, but you can always renounce your citizenship and walk out so we are only arguing about where the line is.
You can laugh and talk about weak hands and dumb asses all you want, but to make an informed decision you need all the knowledge. So if Bitcoin became the "world currency" it would a) be forcing people to use it b) be forcing people to accept a risk tolerance of + / - huge amounts. That is why it should never replace fiat like Richard Ver wants or others think.
I like Bitcoin the way it is now (and actually think it's a good idea to buy 1 and hodl if you got spare cash) but to say Bitcoin would not impose anything on others if it replaced fiat money... a fantasy. It would impose the will of those early whales on everyone else.
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:21:05
FDIC is a thing. We are just arguing a line.
We have two examples, Great Depression that was ended only with great human suffering with WW2, or 2008 that people barely remember. Most people have jobs, if you invested in indexed funds or any kind of investment you doing great (even Bitcoin).
Live in reality, not some ideological political fantasy.
@_date: 2018-05-12 18:14:19
Why wouldn't using your money in the most advantageous way possible be capitalist? Because you say so?
Capitalism is amoral; it is not an ethical code or moral compass or anything at all. You can definitely make money off the suffering of others and you can definitely make money stepping on the little guy, which is the point of railing against crony capitalism. If you think that capitalism = libertarianism, you are wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:36:08
Except we are talking about capitalist cronies lobbying government to gain advantage. Anyone is free to do that. It's like hiring hitmen or mercenaries, pure capitalism. Whoever is outbid, is fucked.
You can argue against the term crony capitalism all you want, but it exists to remind everyone that capitalism is not a moral code or ethical standard. A reminder that people like you and others would rather not have for political or agenda reasons.
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:40:31
Nothing there precludes cronyism; that is using insider knowledge, connections, nepotism, and so on to gain an unfair advantage. All of that is voluntary, none of that is forced. Just because government is involved, doesn't mean the market isn't free... the government is just another economic actor like everyone else.
You just don't want to admit that crony capitalism is a valid characterisation of at least some types of capitalism.

I think it is too and it's one reason to enter the market
Whales, rich, wall street, hedge funds... and even libertarians, anarchists, criminals and so on who buy into Bitcoin... are actually redistributing their money to liberals, technocrats, charities and yes even governments with taxes (hello Coinbase IRS).
I find it hilarious... Bitcoin will never replace money, but all this HODL stuff is creating a price floor. There actually is intrinsic value for Bitcoin being built every single day based on faulty assumptions... but leading to a greater good. Not to replace money, but to fleece novice traders and create bag holders. Also libertarians, anarchists, super wealthy usually people who wouldn't be caught dead doing charity. Also creating an insurance pool... in dire times, someone in trouble can cash out.
Most people's investment strategies should include holding 1 bitcoin.

Bad analogy, most cases can't resist rape you can walk out of your country, revoke your citizenship, not pay do whatever you want... Unless you live in a dictatorship but we are talking taxes only. You might say it's a bad deal but it's still a deal it is called social contract. See the last word, contract.
You can bring up whatever edge cases you want, doesn't change the main facts.
You're the one who doesn't get it... I have made a lot of money off HODL freaks, and I will keep making a lot more, lol. HODL creates a price floor. But keep going probably the best part of crypto is taking money from people who think like you, who evade taxes.

And they would be in the minority. Austrian school is bullshit.
I like Bitcoin the way it is now as an alternative mode of payment or asset or "digital gold". As an actual currency, backed by a government? No fucking way. That's just giving all the wealth to the whales. Slight inflation is infinitely preferable to any sort of deflation, because it forces people with money to spend it, which is good for the economy. Yes, "liberty" might be impacted but who the fuck gave the people who came first the right to get real purchasing power just sitting on their ass? I like the way Bitcoin is now, as a market.
So my own self-interest will be, any politician who proposes Bitcoin to replace real money be voted out of office. Because I don't want whales laughing their ass off while I have to slave at work. Hoarding is real, so is deflationary spiral, so is liquidity. Now Bitcoin as an asset or alternative money? No problem.
Fuck off whales and libertarians and especially Austrian school. Your liberty ends if it takes away my liberty.
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:10:41
My primary objection to Bitcoin is it's social engineering of the worst kind. I don't want to see people rewarded for hoarding, and deflation is pure bullshit. Slight inflation forces the rich or those who already made it, to invest in actual tangible assets and give a chance to people born later or coming after, not just hoarding because they came first. Deflation, rewards people who sit on their ass and do nothing, or who came first, and suppresses consumer spending.
So as an asset or even for speculation I have no problems with Bitcoin. I actually have no problem with Bitcoin, as it is right now, doing what it is right now. As a gold, or a commodity or store of value or just something shiny to make you feel good, is perfect.  As some kind of replacement for fiat... should the US government or any country actually adopt Bitcoin I would be looking to move out or actually campaign against it. All you are doing is replacing control by whatever Federal reserve with whoever the top address holders are in Bitcoin. And no longer have the tools to deal with recessions or even worse depression. Which is why it won't happen. But that doesn't mean there isn't a place for Bitcoin in the economy.
P.S. I am bullish on Bitcoin.

It's coercion, not theft or extortion... you can always choose not to pay and suffer the consequences, or even leave the country. In exchange for the hospital or police or firefighters or army being forced to protect you or save your life.
Nothing about crypto by default says anonymous. SOME crypto is anonymous, and not even that strongly. And the belief in tax has nothing to do with crypto. You can believe in tax or not believe in tax. For a real mind fuck, belief in tax doesn't mean you alone have to pay tax. You could believe that only rich or well off should pay tax or more tax.
Life is more complicated than HODL or no tax, sorry.

Glad they found the guy
Also the guy "agreed to extradition" so who knows maybe he's innocent let justice run its course, no vigilante justice... even if he had not people should never rush to judgement due process always it's what makes us civilised
Cases like this might lead to a ban on using SMS authentication... will probably force all legal exchanges to issue YubiKey or equivalent
