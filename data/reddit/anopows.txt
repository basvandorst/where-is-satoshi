Yes they could indeed manipulate the market, but they can't do it like Pirate40. 
To my knowledge Pirate40 created a ponzi scheme and got rich with it. So he got the money from other people, who already had Bitcoins.
If the DEA wanted to get Bitcoin they have to first buy them. That would boost the Bitcoin price and then if they sell them the price would fall again.
So all they can do is to bring instability, but they can't change the Bitcoin price permanently in my opinion.

uhmmm yes ... Especially if you gain 5Mio $ with it.
OK you are being sarcastic, aren't you?

I'd be happy for you if you would get paid. 
But look at my perspective, I just heard about a week ago about Pirate40.
All I know is (or think I know): 
- A random stranger gives out 7% interest per week
- 7%/per week is more than 3000% interest per year.
- There is no possible way to have a long term interest rate that high (for example Madoff ponzi had 10% interest rate/yr)
- If he could have made 3000% per year interest. Why wouldn't he lend with for example 1% per week and become a billionaire with the other 6% per week?
- Even if he had made more than 3000% interest per year and his business was legitimate: Why would he leave and give away the money? It's nice to be a millionaire.
- Pirate40 has often written in the forum. He was nice to the community, so people became more confident to give him money. (Like borrowing money to a good friend: You think he can't betray you, because there is a empathetic link between you and him).
- People wanted to believe it. I would be very happy to invest in something for that I have guaranteed 7% interest per week. Different motivation can be found here where this lead to actually believing it.
- Cognitive dissonance: Their wish became reality for them. So it's plausible they are denying every fact that indicates that it's a ponzi scheme, because it's too hurtful to accept the truth.
Where do you think I'm wrong?

It's no 33%, it's 3'272%!
Edit for clarification: 
- 33% interest: 1$ -&gt; 1.33$
- 3'272.5% interest: 1$ -&gt; 33.725$

I also didn't believe that it would be 3'272% until I calculated it myself. 33% is already huge but that number seems so unbelievable high xD

If they succeed: They have spent a lot of money for 20 Million now worthless bitcoins. If nobody trades them they are worthless and just a bit of data. And next day Bitcoin 2.0 would start.
But I don't even think they would suceed. If they want to buy the whole market, prices would skyrocket. If they have to buy 10 Mio Bitcoins for 1k-10k$ per Bitcoin it gets expensive and results in rich Bitcoin owners and a poor DEA. (That fact would make Bitcoin 2.0 even more popular: You have the chances that the DEA buys your bitcoin for 1000 times the price xD )

Reminds me of this video:  (2:30 - 3:30)

I hope you are kidding ...
If not: Believing someone named pirate that gives you more than 3000% interest a year is the most stupid thing I ever heard.

1.10 = 10% not 110%
So you are correct it's 33.725 times the original price which was 1.000. So the result is 3'272.5% interest and not 3'372.5%. Or do I see something wrong?
