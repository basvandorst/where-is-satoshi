i'm not sure i understand the advantage of having a paper wallet except that the keys cannot be found except physically. i use bitcoin for transactions while i'm out, which is why it's important that i can make these transactions on my phone. if something happens to my phone (which it did last time, and i lost all my bits), i want to be able to retrieve my wallet. it doesn't matter how i can retrieve it, so if you have any suggestions, please :)

for everyone who is wondering where people get so many amazon gift cards, take me as an example. i'm one of the many that are "paid" with amazon as currency. i'm a cam girl that does private shows through reddit; check my post history if you're interested in the idea, or in me haha. because i am not located in the US (barring me from services like google wallet), my options for payment are limited to amazon or bitcoin. i'm thrilled to have this service available and just made my first transaction - bought a bunch of cheerios and a diabetes kit for some random person in the states and will get their bits once it arrives.

?!?!?!?! why on earth would i do that? the whole point is NOT having to carry a paper, a card, or anything, just my phone. why would i want to split up my bits into increments in the first place when i can have it all in one place? i don't want to have to memorize phrases or make sure i remember where papers are kept. i want everything available on my phone, and to have a backup available online if something happens to it.
