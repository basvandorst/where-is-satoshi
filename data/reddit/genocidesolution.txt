And now you know how the wealthy feel about the 99%. Fortunately for us, our wealth is infinitely divisible and in pure liquid form. If the day comes that 1 satoshi = 100 cans of coca cola, I will be a most generous god.

I'm curious, do you have actual statistics saying the AHA is going poorly or that things are worse now than before the AHA went into effect?

So once weekends drop again, that means we're on an upward trend, right?

I was talking with my dad about selling for literally 5 minutes and the price went from 2880 to 2790. top kek.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:24:49
Looks like it dropped at 2880. I was literally about to sell, but decided to wait five minutes and it immediately fell to 2750.
