8btc forum was founded in 2011. Currently the biggest community about cryptocurrencies, blockchain etc. 8btc received seed fund from Lightspeed China Partners( in May 2014, and awarded as "Zhejiang Economic Innovation Enterprise" in Dec 2014. 
In the past 4 years, 8btc has grown into the biggest community for bitcoin/altcoin/blockchain fans. BTCC, OKCoin, Huobi, Btc38 and almost all major cryptocurrency entities have set up subforums to listen to the feedback from their users.

Thanks. is there anyway I can check the V4 status via bitcoin-qt command?

It depends. They usually promise withdrawal within 24 hours. During the non-rush hour, one usually wait like 3 hours.

Other speakers include Wang Yongli, ex-VP of Bank of China; Xiao Feng, former Vice Chair of Wanxiang Group, Leon Li, founder and CEO of Huobi; Sha Qian, author of unowned currency: 2014 Report of Cryptocurrency in China.

It's obvious Coindesk didn't read between line. "Once approved by the regulatory body, you can resume the currency business. [For the specific time], please pay attention to the official announcement [on Huobi]" means gov and exchanges are still bargaining instead of "everything is just fine the only thing needed is the approval".

We apologize for any misunderstanding from the title. But actually the news went viral in Chinese Bitcoin community and the national TV station. For Chinese Bitcoin community who are encouraged by recent high price, it is "breaking" news to hear some signals like this. 8btc has stated clearly no "ban" is given, no restrictive measures are mentioned.  We will pay attention to the rhetoric next time.
@_date: 2017-01-03 01:29:35
There will be notes if the article are translated from Chinese, other wise it's  written by English. 8btc international site focus more on Chinese Bitcoin/Block circle and things that might impact Chinese community, aiming at letting westerners know what is going on in China. On the other hand, the Chinese site of 8btc has a global coverage of Bitcoin/Blockchain.

Qingfeng is a seasoned developer with over 10 years of development experience in C++, Javascript. He used to work as development engineer in Kodak, Yunyun, Sina Weibo. He was drawn to Bitcoin in 2012 and built a Ripple gateway in 2013. In 2016, he started working fulltime to develop ASCH. ASCH is an ethereum-like platform that adopts an enhanced DPOS consensus mechanism. The sidechain capability can ease the blockchain bloating issue and allows more robust deployment of DAPPs.
