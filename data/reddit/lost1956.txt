SO, you have a trustless digitalized p2p value in Bitcoin, but you have to trust in these chinese guys. Not so good for Bitcoin.

Germany will be a muslim country, Schauble's grandchilds will be slaves in their own country.

Where to go Bitcoin?
4-5 chinese guys will show you the way.

Hashing power exists everywhere, in many countries, i know.
But if more than 50% exists in China, and the communists close the FireWall for hours/days/weeks, there will be a bitcoin chain in China and a different chain in the western world.
When China come back, the chinese blockchain will be longer, and all the transaction of the western world will lost.
It can kill bitcoin. Who will trust in bitcoin, if this can happen?

In a real decentralized and long term viable currency nobody cares the miners and mining pools.

...and in 2020, there will be one company, which manufacture the best asic chips, and own more than 99% of hashing power.

Yes. It shows that Bitcoin is a centralised cryptocurrency.
We need a real decentralised, asic proof, mobile based new cryptocurrency.
