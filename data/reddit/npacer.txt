Hey now! My company is moderating an online panel with three great startups in the Bitcoin payments space. Would love to get questions from the community to ask them. 
The panel goes live February 19 at 3p PST/11p GMT, but we'll also post the recording afterwards if you want to check it out later.

Hey now! My company tracks startup activity across various different market sectors, and bitcoin is one of them. 
Basically, we try to identify all of the companies then categorize them. This image here is just a snapshot, so there are a lot of other companies out there, but do you guys think the categories are right? 
@_date: 2014-07-26 01:26:47
Yup, it's upper left in exchanges. A lot of these companies fit into multiple buckets and I wanted to show as many different logos as possible, so I'll admit to some subjectivity/dealer's choice. In the case of Coinbase, their first clear value proposition was to make is SUPER easy for the average joe to buy bitcoin, hence I threw them in exchanges.

Please let me know who they are! I couldn't put all 500+ logos on the single sheet of paper, but I'll let you know whether or not I'm tracking them in the database behind this chart.

One of the other commenters provided a link to the full market map that I maintain (venturescanner.com/scans/bitcoin), so that's where you can go to see everything I'm tracking. 
As for this "one-pager", it's really just meant as a fun summary since there is no way to put all 500+ logos on a single page. I tried to show a company only once (even if they fit into multiple categories), then picked companies that raised a lot of venture capital, and then picked logos that i thought were cool :-)

Good idea, I'll do that on the next rev.

I tended to take a more inclusive approach when creating the categories. So while there are a lot of technical/process variations on how different websites allow me to purchase bitcoin, I just lumped them all together as exchanges for simplicity. 
However, now that there are a TON of exchanges out there, I might breakup the exchange category into a few different ones that reflect those differences.

Thanks! The goal is definitely to stay on top of things

A little down from the top of the page should be a row of "tabs". The "company" one has direct links above their name. Hope that helps! 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:55:14
Good catch! I don't know why the links aren't working right now, will get on that. If you click on the "company" tab you should see a listing of all the companies, with a out-bound link included.

Hey now! First time poster, long time lurker :-)
 
As a fellow Bitcoin enthusiast and financier, I wanted to do my part to help people navigate the Bitcoin startup ecosystem. Since I think r/bitcoin is the best-informed community, I was hoping to get your guys’ take - do you have any feedback on our scan?
 
BTW: Scans = dynamic page around a startup category (in this case “bitcoins”) that provides readers with competitive intelligence, insights, and relevant news - curated by both technology and analysts on a constant basis.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:11:01
Links should be working now 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:43:13
Thanks for the links! My scan is new, but I think it'll be best to wait until something (like the ETF) is operational/up-and-running before I put it on my list. 
Also, there's a pretty cool company trying to keep track of all the little shops that accept BTC:
