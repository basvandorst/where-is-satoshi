It was [here](
I thought the talk was mildly interesting but didn't offer any really new insights.
Yes - bitcoin can be used for good or bad things - but so can many other things. That seems to be a possible start for a discussion, but in the talk that is as far as it got.

I may have been having a bit of fun at his expense there, but honestly I do wish him well getting future issues out now the "conveyor belt" is in place. 
It is a big achievement and I am sure he's had to knock a few heads together to get it done.

I always knew bitcoin was a conspiracy funded by the Vatican. :-)
@_date: 2012-08-08 10:40:47


Sounds like they converted the bitcoin amounts at the prevailing exchange rate. I notice this is what they are owed **after** they were partly paid back.
@_date: 2012-02-01 13:09:50
I'm confused. You quote turnover of $15.8M but revenue of only $337K over the same period. 
I can't work out what difference you are drawing between turnover and revenue which would account for such a difference.
@_date: 2012-05-25 23:19:04
I agree. Where was the due diligence? Surely the first two questions you should ask are:
* How do you do your daily backups?
* How much do you keep in your hot wallet?
It sounds like they just drifted into this and let Zhou Tong carry on fiddling as he saw fit. 
@_date: 2012-06-26 15:21:45
That $250K is also not far off the usual daily volume for MtGox - which means it is not easy for BitPay to convert the bitcoins back into dollars for the merchant without moving the price. So Butterfly Labs seem to be doing a good job of testing all aspects of Bitcoin at once.
Another interesting question is whether there is enough total demand to justify anyone else paying the engineering costs to develop a competing ASIC. There will be about 1.3M bitcoins mined next year with a value of $8M maybe. So that is the size of the pie to be split between competing manufacturers (assuming a one year payback time). 
That seems to be enough to fund another development, but bear in mind that once BFL have paid back their development costs they could very aggressively drop the price of their units. Interesting times all round.

From the article:


So 78% of all bitcoins have never been spent. This means that miners are indeed soaking up excessive liquidity. Availability is not constrained by the raw rate at which bitcoins are generated (but it is constrained by the rate at which miners feed their supply to market - which may stay in the same ratio.)
*edit: I think I might have misunderstood their point above. They are not saying that the coins have never been spent - only that they have now stopped moving.*

Do you think he realises he has to do it all again every month?

A touch of the Ozymandias there I think.

Well that's strange - you can't [pay with bitcoins.](

Alos, MtGox support SEPA for EU customers. So they appeal to wider base of potential customers.

He is asking you about the ASIC rather than the PCB.
@_date: 2011-06-30 17:52:18
The most important point he makes is this:


This is a very mature understanding of the situation. By having layers of security, just breaking in is not enough. 
As they admit themselves, they got off very lightly under the circumstances.
@_date: 2011-09-05 15:17:25
Start [here]( and then
Basically Artforz created a very large "transaction" with many inputs/outputs. As he says nothing got taken down. A few nodes had a memory problem and crashed.
@_date: 2011-09-13 22:39:10
ArtForz changed the timestamps on the blocks in some creative way which confused the difficulty algorithm and caused the difficulty to to be set artificially lower than it should be for the amount of hashing effort being applied.
He did this on a very obscure crypto-currency called Geist Geld. Since then, Bitcoinexpress has refined the technique for his planned attack on NameCoin. If I understand correctly, the same attack *could* be made on BitCoin but it would be more difficult to pull off because you do need to - at least initially - overwhelm all the other miners' contributions.
@_date: 2011-06-20 22:27:56
Because no floating point operations are used in computing a hash.

I was surprised to see Tradehill go public in the forum post they made earlier today on this subject. But now things begin to make sense. Clearly this has been an ongoing issue between Tradehill and Dwolla for about 2 weeks and they have made no progress.
By going public and no longer accepting Dwolla they have raised the stakes quite dramatically.
It will be interesting to see whether Dwolla "call" them on it or "fold".
@_date: 2011-07-29 17:02:18
The fact that you (and everyone else) knows how much they have lost exactly demonstrates the lack of restraint on their part.
They had a reasonable dispute with Dwolla about the way that Dwolla handled and failed to properly communicate fraudulent transactions.
But there was no need to say anything on public forums/websites other than that they were temporarily (or otherwise) ceasing to accept Dwolla. 
They might have said that this was because of fraud. But they did not need to provide copies of emails and CSV files, and a blow-by-blow account of their discussions and frustrations with their supplier.  That simply showed a lack of business common sense. 
Not only have they made it more difficult to reestablish a relationship with Dwolla, but they have shown a willingness to escalate a B2B issue into a public slanging match. Dwolla have wisely kept their opinion on the issue off the forums.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:27:43
I think it is very unlikely they will be back at 2am.
(1) They have a heck of a lot of work to do, and (2) if some users' accounts can be compromised from the leaked info (as it seems is true) they absolutely must not allow the site to go live with those accounts wide open to instant attack.
@_date: 2011-06-20 14:43:10


But this 432,000 account was created on 12-June by consolidating a lot of coins. So if this is MtGox money they only had it in one consolidated account for a short time. I do not see why reconsolidating it would prove anything.
An alternative interpretation is that they decided to split the total across several accounts to reduce the exposure if a private key was stolen.
However, if one user had 500,000+ coins in his MtGox account,then MtGox must be holding more than 500,000 coins total. so where are the other 100,000 coins?
@_date: 2011-09-13 22:41:49
When that paper was written, this new exploit was not known about. It is not even necessary to have control of 51% of the hashing power to use the new exploit.
@_date: 2011-07-26 23:43:04
Seems almost certain MtGox have had similar scams pulled on them through Dwolla. Perhaps they have just written the losses off and kept very quiet to avoid anyone else trying it.
Now Tradehill have made a big noise that strategy might no longer work.
@_date: 2011-07-04 18:53:03
Yep -- look at the volumes at 2.00pm/3.00pm and compare them with 3.00am-11.00am in [the chart.](
@_date: 2011-06-22 22:59:04
You could not get both transactions into the same block because this would make the block invalid and it would be rejected. (And anyway generally your client emits transactions which are built into blocks by others.)
If you emit two mutually contradicting transactions then the second one to arrive would be rejected because it contradicts something already stitched into an earlier block.
If somehow you contrived to get both transactions stitched into different blocks where the earlier part of the block chain does not contain the other transaction then you have achieved the mythical forked block chain and you probably did this by using vast amounts of hashing power to try to beat the rest of the network to incorporate the block. 
But even if you manage this, all that happens is that you effectively brute-force your later transaction to override the earlier one. There is no way that they both manage to wind up in a finally agreed block chain.
@_date: 2011-06-28 13:28:21
But that thread explicitly says that it was not possible to spend money you don't have.
@_date: 2011-09-13 23:36:52
There is a claim [here]( that the attack can be pulled off with 25%.
I don't know the details of the exploit well enough to say whether that is true or just bluster.
@_date: 2011-07-26 12:55:53
Hilariously explained on the forum like this:
























@_date: 2011-07-11 10:12:19
A nice bit of press schmoozing there from Camp BX. They also managed to get a couple of thinly-veiled digs in against mtGox and TradeHill.
Something he didn't mention is that unless these newer exchanges can get their volumes up to where MtGox currently is, they won't be around for very long. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 15:08:20
Plenty of other exchanges still [operating]( Mind you, the volumes are tiny compared with what MtGox usually sees.
It will be interesting to see whether MtGox can recover its previous volumes when it restarts.
@_date: 2011-07-29 12:47:59
Or maybe Mt Gox builds professional relationships with its suppliers, rather than get into playground spats on forums.
Tradehill's lack of restraint was shocking.
@_date: 2011-06-26 21:45:10
Looking at [bitcoinmonitor]( it is pretty clear that at the moment TradeHill trades are in a range up to about 10 BTC but MtGox trades are in a range up to about 100 BTC.
MtGox is still the only place for traders who want to trade meaningful quantities. 
That is why I don't think people will move their coins out. The other exchanges' prices move too far if a big buy or sell order gets placed.
@_date: 2011-06-20 14:57:57
It is a very hostile article, which links to another hostile article by the same guy. 
So I guess confusing exchange security with bitcoin security is par for the course here.
But while he is lobbing anything he can find at his target he missed the most worrying issue: that one person controls 1/12 of the entire stock of bitcoins in existence. This bitcoin-rich individual had moved them to MtGox so we can presume that he was planning on selling them off (maybe a bit more slowly of course.)
So no matter what happened yesterday, those 500,000 coins are on their way and they will push the price down significantly.
@_date: 2011-06-27 23:37:35
[This]( is a log scale graph of the price at MtGox since Sep-10. (Log scale makes it much easier to see the trends I think.)
The previous pattern seems to be three month plateaus and 2-3 month sprints. The present sub-$20 plateau probably has another 1-2 months to run. (The $30 was just an overshoot this time round; the price was and still is trying to sit just under $20.)
But as they say, past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance. At some point the price is not going to do what everyone expects. 
Ultimately what is supporting the price at the moment is the continuing flood of new buyers. You can see that the volumes suddenly increased in April and pushed the price up from $1 to $20. In the same time period we now know that MtGox customer base increased dramatically.
So for the price to rise again I think it is going to need another flood of new buyers.
@_date: 2013-02-06 00:52:17
I see this new one is "Rev C" and the one you have posted was "Rev A".
As others mentioned at least one revision was because of their late decision to change the package they used.
Frankly I think BFL are their own worst enemies. They keep improving things instead of just getting something shipped. When Avalon upped their spec from 50GH/s to 66GH/s they just plonked down another board with another 80 chips on it. Crude but effective. BFL countered by upping their clock speed and keeping to the same tiny board with only eight chips to do all the work. That is very impressive, but they did not need to do that. They could have kept to their original speed and shipped with the original chips. Heck, if the chips were getting too hot at the original speed they could have dropped the speed a little but **still shipped first**.
As it is, they clearly have a superior product from a technical point of view. But, as they may be learning the hard way, that is not necessarily what counts. In fact it is rarely what counts.
