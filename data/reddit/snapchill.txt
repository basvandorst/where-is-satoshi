A hundred people already pointed out that credit unions do the same service for free. Up here in Canada, I can name two banks (PC Financial and Tangerine that are low-cost or no-cost to people with minimal income). It is mindboggling that you think it's okay for banks to charge people with little income (or low balances) a monthly charge but waive it for those with higher balances. The irony here is that you T_D ilk crow on about the plight of the "small guy", but only when it's immigrants or blacks who are somehow disadvantaging the poor white guy...but when a multibillion dollar corporation charges burdensome fees on poor people (and less burdensome or non existent fees on rich people), you don't give a shit. 


Oh yeah, of course, that makes it perfectly fine then! 
Crawl back to your T_D shithole, bag boy.

The article is literally citing a comedian as its sole source for this story. Fuck outta here with this horseshit.
U.S. government does a lot of shady shit; we don't need to go dumpster diving in RT.com to find stories backing that up.
