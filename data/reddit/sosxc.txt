well and good.  but wouldn't you agree that they should allow customers to cancel a trade and get instant refund if it is taking too long? 
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:17:44
ouch. that really makes me sick to hear.    Especially when it is technically so easy to offer customers an instant refund button.
It is stories like yours that really make me question their ethics, rather than just chalking it up to a technical glitch here or there.
An ethical company that advertises instant trades would not accept funds if they know a trade cannot be made in timely manner, and would automate instant refunds if a customer requests it during "processing".

Precise.    mostly always used it in the past, and never waited more than 1-2 minutes after payment confirmed, so this was very unexpected.  and of course at the worst possible time.
do you know if quick has some sort of time guarantee whereas precise does not?

thx for this explanation.  It makes some sense.  I was under the impression that
shapeshift maintains pool or buffer accounts in each currency so they can payout their customers instantly from those.  then they can make large orders on te exchanges as needed to rebalance the buffers.   Now it can be that the buffer accounts run out sometimes due to high demand, but in this case the customer should be warned that an exchange trade will be required and it can take an arbitrary amount of time, *AND* it should be possible to cancel the order for a refund.
If they truly are placing limit orders on an exchange for each trade, I just don't see how that can work because sometimes a limit order may never be met if market is moving in opposite direction.

To be clear, I am not complaining so much about the time taken as saying that:
1. customer should be informed in advance if trade cannot be completed in "instant" fashion, and provided some sort of time guarantee.
2. At any point after deposit has been confirmed and before exchanged funds are actually sent to the customer, the customer should be given an option to cancel the exchange and immediately refund back to the "refund address" initially provided.
These two changes would make one feel much more confident using the service, instead of "cross fingers and hope it works this time" kind of situation.
A simple way to implement things would be to give a guarantee. example:   your funds will be sent within 10 minutes of deposit confirmation:   either to your target address or to your refund address.   Any delays beyond that will be compensated at 0.0007% of trade amount  per minute, approx equivalent to 1% interest per day.
As shapeshift customers, I think we need to demand such a guarantee.

Bisq is probably the best known decentralized exchange, and the open-source software runs locally on the desktop.  There have been various calls for design improvement, so I'm sure your contributions could be valued there.   I would suggest you post your availability at

why not use i2p instead of tor?   It is reportedly faster and better for hosting darknet websites (eepsites) than tor hidden services.  ( and likely more secure also )
They have client libs you can bake right into mycelium, so it should be transparent to the user, no setup required.
just sayin....

countries that adopt strict regulations with regards to bitcoin will be at a competitive disadvantage to those that do not.

there's been notice pretty much every day on this subreddit warning to stay away from coinbase.
we can all consider this another one.

insightful comment, thx.

First things first. You should verify your balance and identify if there are any suspicious outgoing transactions.
In Multibit classic you can go to the Request tab and see a list of your receive addresses.  Click on each one, then click on the copy-to-clipboard button.  Go to your favorite block explorer such as blockchain.info and enter each address.  There you see all the transactions and present balance for each address.
