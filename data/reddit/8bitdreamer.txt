Satoshi is our imaginary savior that came to earth, spread the good word of cryptocurrency, then left us with his prophets.  Perhaps crucified by the NSA.
Andreas and Co are prophets, crypto-believers spread their teachings as their recorded in the holy YouTube.
Ver is Judas... easy
The majority of us run our like religious lunatics spreading the word of cryptocurrency.   Most people we run into think we're nuts.  Those that don't believe obviously don't understand the truth, so we yell at them.
We all know we've been saved by Satoshi.

I'll also note that I was watching a documentary one time, i believe it was on netflix, that states that the government has funnelled inflation into the housing market on purpose.
Inflation "finds" a place to go, it does not necessarily raise all price equally.   
Through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, low interest rates for housings, easy loanes, etc the government has managed to funnel their inflation into housing.
The reason is brilliant.   Nobody that owns a house complains about raising house prices.  65% of people own their home.

I believe bitcoin transaction fees will one day be $50, as major companies bid to compete for space in the core blockchain.

Andreas has called Bitcoin "innovation without permission" a number of times....  Satoshi did not ask for permission to code/launch bitcoin, and any business operating within the space doesn't have to ask for permission to code their app.

This is my favourite calculator.   It doesn't tell you what inflation actually is, but it does tell you what they say is bullshit.
Take anything you can remember the price on from your childhood, such as movie tickets, and see if the numbes match your expectations.
For example, my first tank of gas in 1999 was 99 cents/gallon.  According to the calculator, it should be $1.41 now.
Movie tickets from my childhood were about $4.50.   They should be about $6.82 now.   They are infact closer to $9
Concrete by the yard in 2002 was about $35.   Now its about $85.   calculator says it should be $46.00.
Wheat has gone from 300 in 2001 to 800 today.   Calculator says it should be $400. (
In general, once you run enough things through the calculator, NOTHING has only gone up by the government inflation rate, which means their inflation rate is bullshit.
Aside from technology, everything rises faster than inflation except your wages.

I watched the whole thing while driving today.  tl;dr he believes in debt free money and that congress should spend money into existence without borrowing it.    
I like his ideas.   Even though I'm an avid bitcoin fan, I do believe that fiat money can work, but I believe it has to be backed by WORK.
I dont care what the work is doing, whether it be gathering cow shit or digging for gold, SOMETHING has to constrain unlimited ability to print.
I did get a good laugh every time he explained how the previous fiat money failed...... that was a consistent theme.  "then this fiat failed.... then this fiat failed.... then this fiat failed..."
His argument on what would constrain congresses printing press was essentially that they dont constrain today so it doesn't matter..    This is where he lost me.     If/When congress can spend money without having to borrow it first, bad bad bad things would happen.

Less trust off blockchain transactions like "open transactions" protocol, or tree chains both get my vote for now.    
In general scalability is not an impossible solution.
@_date: 2014-04-11 23:48:00
Side chains will allow further utilization of bitcoin hashing power.   1000 side chains moving hundreds of thousands of transactions, all required a different nonce/block solution.   Instead of miners solving one block in one block chain every ten minutes, they will solve thousands of blocks on thousands of side chains, while still only solving 1 in ten minutes on the btc block chain.  Each block chain gets the same security as the rest of the network.   Miners get fees from thousands of block chains as the block reward declines.
So the same mining power can move all transactions in the entire world.

I do love bitwage and have sent 100% of my paycheck there for a couple months.    I do have one concern with them, since their process is manual.   We trust that they give the price of bitcoin when they execute the deposit.    If they wanted to, they could get the deposit and purchase bitcoin at the given price.    They could then wait 6-12 hours and see if the price goes up.   If the price goes up, they send us bitcoin at the new, higher price.   If the price goes down, they give us the price they bought at.

I suppose when I wrote this i thought it would be completely valid for the IMF or whatever to implement on a world wide scale.  
You make a valid point in that the rest of the world mostly dislikes the US and would never support a system.  It would appear today that the US is the only government that would implement my system as well.  If China, Russia, and oil producing counties "opt out" it would take to make my described system "unmanageable"
It could potentially also split the world into two different economic zone, countries that control bitcoin and those that dont, which would be bad for everybody.
