Thank you ! It finally arrived. Don't refund me please, I prefer to keep it as dash. I deleted my negative reviews.

Yeah ��
I'm going to do some action to make them react (post on reddit, rate their apps, contact the play store)

Hello Alvin,
it's been over a week now. Are you still working around the clock ? 
- Improving your online image has nothing to do with being or not being a fraudulent company
- Rocking trees rock even when the wind flows as a private message, so why did freewallet not answer to my emails ?
- the way your team helped me was : saying my claim was illegitimate because I entered a wrong dash address. It was the one the app gave me. Moreover the address was irrelevant, they just had to inspect the transaction hash. Which they didn't do although they made me send it 3 times. After complaining everywhere I could, they admitted I deserved a refund. And then nothing.
It was supposed to take 5-20 minutes. Are cryptocurrencies services on strike ?

Freewallet made wallets for every digital currency. These apps don't let the user access their private keys. They claim that it makes it safer in case your phone gets stolen, but that doesn't make sense.
Its an estonian company, its founder is called Alvin Hagg.
They use the services of a partner company, Changelly, to do currency exchange. From what I've read on reddit, changelly also has questionable behaviour, as it retains money for a long period of time for no reason.
