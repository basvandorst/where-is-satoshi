" the banks in Australia want to establish dedicated third-party apps that can utilize tap-and-pay for the iPhone.   What makes this interesting is that the banks don’t actually want to use Apple Pay itself."

good gathering/presenting of stats of topic.
ok... its an overview, as you say.
But if you consider this FUNDAMENTAL, it leaves me wanting for an analysis of its value as an investable asset.
- comparison to gold or other currencies?
- does it track or counter any other asset class?
- Is value pegged to its utility as a medium of exchange, vs holdable scarce asset.
- what happens to this asset when there is local/global disruption... volatility?  
- being a new asset class, what impact will regulation have going forward?
