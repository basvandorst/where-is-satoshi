The TLDR is:
we shouldnt be surprised that the Chinese government has banned bitcoin transactions, as its their prerogative to be controling ass holes.
bitcoin speculation for the sake of making extra fiat is not the point of bitcoin, the point is that it becomes to cenre point for all transactions
sorry for the extra words guys...

Hey guys, sorry for this shameless plug, but me and my partner have just made what we hope will be a great asset to the Bitcoin community!
so yes, it is based in Australia for now, but that is where we are located :) still worth having a look though

Ok, i love bitcoins, and i feel as though your comment is mocking BTC in some way (though I cant quite put my finger on it) but it legitimately made me laugh out loud! 
If i could upvote more than once i would :)
But in shirt, that is why we have mBTC, satoshis etc

One of the largest business costs is labour, so when a businesses labour force starts accepting payment in Bitcoin, then this helps reduce the amount of bitcoin the business needs to sell for fiat in order to keep producing their goods/services. I understand that the workers then need to pay it forward and buy things with their bitcoin, otherwise it is just a further step from the original purchaser selling at an exchange; but it is a start.

LTC has surged also, BTC making it to 1000 is a small increase in the last week, LTC has increased by a LOT more!

I did say thus far ;)

IMHO, in order to ban it they would have to prove that it stands a tangible threat to our civilisation. Our civilisation is built upon the basic tenant of Capitalism and Market Based economics. Within this model Capital will always follow the path of least resistance (least regulation, fastest transfers, lowest fees etc). This path is very quickly becoming Bitcoin. 
With Bitcoin taking off in China it would be a serious blunder for the US to ban it. The smartest thing any government could do at this point in time is give assistance to their own companies who are integrating Bitcoin.
If you treat Bitcoin as an enemy you will lose. If you treat Bitcoin as a means to your own end, you will probably do rather well.

Many people learn this the hardway, good on you for not releasing after a pushy vendor with semi-non-existent feedback tried to get you to release before the funds were clear :)

Just keep detailed records, do'nt spend your profits yet and see what happens on July 1st... Im planning on treating my trading as though it were a commodity aka CGT and then paying tax on any of the fiat increases i have made.

The problem is to do more with regulation controls. If any Government dcided to make it near impossible for a business or company to work with BTC (such as making it illegal, or even making it so taxable that its not worth using) then at the end of the day the price would drop. 
Its no coincidence that as the US congress was essentially embarking in their "bitcoin lovefest" and it was becoming apparent that BTC would be here to stay; that this is also the same time that the prices boomed and hit record highs.
When a government wants to clamp down on something, they can and will. This does not involve targeting individuals, it involved targeting businesses. 
For an interesting look at government response that has successfully stopped a cyber currency Google search QQ coin China Government
Having said all that, BTC has every ability to survive a ban, it would just drive it underground

invite only makes it safer, just doesn;t help much when you don't know anyone who uses it hahaha

I think there is probably a surprising amount of BTC in locked or dormant wallets, that Scandinavian kid who bought $27 bucks worth (cbf checking exact figure, so sue me) soon forgot about it, he saw it as a novelty purchase; next minute he is buying an apartment outright!
