If you are selling a risky product or service, perhaps. But probably not the case for this product, and for most sellers. I've sold thousands of products via PayPal and the chargebacks and related issues are well under 1%.
I'd say you do this because you love Bitcoin, you are trying to get PR/good will from Bitcoiners, or you are in the rare category of businesses that does get scammed a lot with credit cards or PayPal (charge-backs and fraud).

I was doing some research on eToro. I'm not a user, and was super-confused by everyone saying you can't withdraw crypto from eToro, as they make is seem like you can!
Transferring coins to eToro Wallet (from trading platform):  
Transfering coins from eToro Wallet to another wallet:  
But then, as I was writing this response, I saw this!:  
Am I cynical to think eToro hopes users will see the first two links, but not the third? IMO, they should say on the first two links that these features are not yet rolled out to most users.

Stumbled upon this thread via a google image search. These appear to be from Andreas Antonopoulos' Safe Paper Wallet kit. I bought a big set of them (my first purchase ever using Bitcon), but found they were too thick to fit through my cheap inkjet correctly, and my unbuntu startup CD didn't have a driver that worked with my laser printer. So now I'm just holding them as a collector's item… Not that anyone asked.

I kept searching for it on the page, and finally realized the "banner ad" at the top mentioned Bitcoin. While I was hoping for a simple donate BTC address, I realize the show needs to convert it to fiat, which means they need to use a payment processor (Coinbase in this case), in which case I guess they want to know your email address (but nothing more) for their records. It seems you could enter a fake email address (if you wanted more anonymity), because you simply pay after supplying the email address.

But in Bitcoin's case, one is expected to do due diligence in deciding Bitcoin is a worthwhile investment, then more due-dilligence figuring out how to safely hold it. They are two very different skills, and some people really lack in the second skill! Hopefully, there will be a more user-friendly ways to securely own Bitcoin with time.

Wow, I just googled this BTC address, as I had 1 BTC end up here, originally from my Blockchain.info account (yes, I have 2fA). It was awhile ago, I just discovered the transaction I hadn't accounted for. No added info, but now I'm nervous about how this happened…

My understanding is they had the issue once (for a couple of hours), and that left a lot of wallets insecure. Many coins were taken by Johoe in two large groups, separated by a number of days. But I didn't think Blockchain.info had this issue twice.

Porn plus Bitcoin seems like such a winning combination. I would guess porn sites will be one of the earliest sectors to completely add Bitcoin payment options, for two big reasons: 1) Most porn consumers don't want obvious porn charges on their credit cards. 
2) Porn sites surely experience a large amount of credit card fraud, and I'm sure they'd like to reduce that.

I'd say Circle and Coinbase are user-friendly on-ramps for newbs, who are used to dealing with banks. Obviously, people looking for financial privacy, and who want avoid centralized off-chain custodial accounts can (and should) use other options to buy and store Bitcoin. But IMO, Circle and Coinbase are perfect for the 99% of people who have never owned Bitcoin, and want to buy some for the first time.

"Buy low and sell high" sounds like an investing credo. But traders are going for trends, selling when they think there will be more short-term selling, and buying when they think there will be more short-term buying. Thus they tend to act in the opposite manner that makes sense to an investor. And that intensifies the volatility greatly.
At least that's my take.
@_date: 2015-01-31 15:03:47
I think these services will always allow you to send your Bitcoin to your own wallet.
However, you do have me thinking about how governments can seize funds from people, through the banking system. So I'd say risk of seizure and funds tracking (by Governments) are the risks I associate with using a compliant exchange. I don't ever see there being a whitelist system of where you can send your Bitcoin.

A Bitcoin CPA I employed told me that buying Bitcoin and immediately using the same amount to buy something could be classified as a transfer in one's books (rather than reporting capital gains/losses on the Bitcoin spend, and using then having the newly-purchased Bitcoin have it's own new cost-basis). Unsure if my accountant was wrong, or maybe being aggressive with the "transfer" classification. What do you think?

It's really a shame that Theymos feels too strongly about this subject to allow for debate to occur. The topic is clearly about the future of BITCOIN (calling XT an altcoin is ridiculous, clinging to semantics at best). This topic deserves to be allowed to be hashed out, and banning further discussion of it is a gross disservice to the community.
It's censorship. It is incorrect that this is moderation to make the community a good one. I can only assume this clear censorship will catalyze a mass migration to an open platform that allows relevant Bitcoin topics to be discussed.
I haven't picked a horse in this fight, but if Theymos is an indication on the right and wrong side of this fight, then I've just been pushed that much closer to supporting XT.

I'd just say that one's online computer could get hacked by anyone in the world. Good encryption and security practices certainly help in a connected world. And often computers are stolen, so encryption again saves the day. I think it's relatively rare that the scenario shown would occure.

Wow, that gives me some crazy thoughts... Could there be a future where some mining pools are known to have specific moral, religious, political (etc.) views, and they will be known to lean towards filtering transactions based on the specific belief system?
I have to admit that I've not really thought about the power of mining pools, until seeing that people running the pools can make a decision to limit the fungibility of bitcoin. I see that it makes sense in this case, but it does seem a bit scary.

@_date: 2015-09-13 15:26:09
I'm positive someone else can answer this better than me (perhaps I'm not even totally accurate), but bigger blocks increase the advantage large miners/pools have, due to increased time to transmit larger blocks to others. Giving bigger miners/pool more advantage increases centralization, and makes it easier for big mining pools to censor a transaction or otherwise make Bitcoin insecure.

I think there are two ways to approach Bitcoin, investing or trading. You bought way into a crazy spike. You went with the momentum, which means you're acting like a trader. So if you're acting like a trader, you have to spot the change in momentum, and then sell with the momentum. That's the short term game, riding the waves of momentum. I'm talking not from experience, I'm not a trader.
Or you buy when the price is low, when there's blood in the streets, when no one is excited about Bitcoin. You hold that longterm, perhaps taking some profits if the price goes up a lot (to hedge against a drop). That's investing, IMO.
Anyway, understandable to feel down. Be ready to see the price go down more... Then go up... Then go down. If you can afford to buy more Bitcoin when it goes down, then at least that gives you a reason to be happy when it's down. And when it's up, you can be happy for the gains.
Or study up to be a trader.
@_date: 2015-03-08 02:39:06
Here's an interesting thought I heard recently expressed by Paul Puey of AirBitz (mobile wallet &amp; directory). Because Coinbase (and others) supposedly keep the vast majority of their Bitcoin offline, if there's ever a large amount of Bitcoin withdrawn in a short period, it can use up the funds in their hot wallet, and keep a lot of transactions waiting to access the cold wallet. I thought this was an interesting explanation for delays that some report having.

I just wanted to offer encouragement on accepting Bitcoin. I really think that one of Bitcoin's biggest strengths as a payment method is for services like adult sites. Your customers don't have to worry about potentially embarrassing charges on their credit cards, or trusting there won't be unauthorized charges. And you don't have to deal with chargebacks due to credit card fraud, which I would assume is more common in adult site payments. Good luck!
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:19:10
I think that's a good point. Whether mining is profitable or not, the system itself works. If enough people bail from mining, and the difficulty goes down enough, then the economics will bring miners back in. At this point in time, I sure don't see the hash rate going down to a point that it makes the network weak enough to be successfully attacked. I do see think we all owe a lot to miners. Whatever their motivation, they risk personal loss while keeping the network secure.

I posted this in the comments section to the article, but realized I may get more answers here.
I'm a relative Bitcoin newb, not a coder, and I don't really understand the underpinning of the QT wallet (or RPC). But my gut reaction to the password vulnerability is, if an attacker ever got ahold of someone's wallet data (say someone stole a laptop or gained access to a backup in the cloud -- both of which seem plausible), could an attacker use the previous version of QT to brute force a password and gain access to all the wallet's contents?
Assuming I didn't totally miss the boat on understanding this... I've heard of this type of password verification process (that has indicative delays that help brute force a password) identified as an insecurity in software ages ago. So I guess I'm a little surprised that the QT client got to this point using code that leaked password clues this way.
I'm looking to learn here, and hoping I'm off base. But if I'm not off base, what would be the smartest steps to make sure pervious Bitcoin QT wallet data (including backups, etc.) are not vulnerable?

I was trying to do some research on Fastcoin, and noticed the Fast_coin twitter account had a surprisingly high number of followers (over 10K). This didnt' make sense, based on the relatively low interest in Fastcoin. But after scrolling down a bit through the followers, and looking at the tweets of the followers, my interpretation is the followers are mostly fake twitter accounts (well done fake accounts, with tweets and followers, but the tweets are not real sounding, and they're very similar among different followers). Not that boosting a Twitter account with a bunch of fake followers means much, but it gives me pause at the integrity of the person(s) behind Fastcoin.

LocalBitcoins.com seems like a very popular way to get this done. If you can organize a Bitcoin meetup or Satoshi Square, that's been a way I've traded and seen many others trade dollars and BTC. In-person seems like a decent way to go, if the environment feels safe. 
But yes, I also think BTC trading could have tax and legal implications. And perhaps scammers and thugs will start finding ways to exploit in-person trades.

You're really paranoid that carrying a coin-sized Bitcoin keychain will have your home robbed? You think people don't break into houses to steal computers and other expensive stuff unless they think there maybe some (unencrypted) Bitcoin to steal? I guess all the Bitcoin t-shirt and sticker stores are insane to you. And, of course, don't go to a Bitcoin Meetup, Satoshi Square, or a Bitcoin Conference, because you're just asking to be followed home and robbed!
Frankly, I think that type of paranoia is too much. Hopefully everyone with considerable BTC has figured out a strategy to keep it safe. I think Bitcoin thieves are mostly online, in countries other than yours, working on attacks that don't require their physical presence in your home, so they will be totally untouchable by law enforcement after grabbing your coins (unlike a person who risks getting caught breaking into your home, hoping to find an unencrypted BTC wallet).

I've been trying to support CoinMKT as a local Bitcoin startup, encouraging people to use them, and trusting them with a little bit of my money/coin (from day one). But I'm losing faith. I'm going to keep my mouth shut and give them a little more time to resolve an issue before I say more. Just note their site clearly says BETA.
Oh, I used Dwolla to fund my account, but with their exit from funding crypto-exchanges, I have no clue about getting fiat in and out.

BTW, I had zero issues signing up or logging in. A Dwolla transfer to fund my account went through instantly, and I've now purchased some Bitcoin on CoinMKT (increased my bid and decreased the amount to match an existing sell order). To transfer the small amount of Bitcoin out, I simply had to fill out a basic KYC form (which seemed almost too easy, though Dwolla knows for sure who I am, so maybe that fills in a gap).

Most people I talk to day-to-day have no clue what Bitcoin is; most have absolutely never heard of it. So wearing a Bitcoin t-shirt gets people asking me what Bitcoin is, and now I get to (try to) explain it to them. To me, this can only be seen as a good thing.
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:12:40
I would say with fair certainty that CryptoArchy.com is not a scam. I've done business with CryptoAnarchy.com, after seeing the seller (LittleShop) is a "hero member" on BitcoinTalk.org, and has been active there for over two years (you'll find plenty of people who thank him for their orders). A scammer would have been called out by now (I think I got scammed by someone on that forum for a small amount of BTC last week, and see the seller already has earned a high do-not-trust rating).
With that said, it sounds like your order did get screwed up, and it sounds like you're getting bad service, if you're not getting responses. I've communicated with the owner via PM on BitcoinTalk.org, you may want to try that.
You mentioned sending a number of emails, but you only specifically mention getting the one response (your order had gotten lost in the car but it would be resent right away). It's unclear in your post, did you get responses to ANY of the other emails you sent? 
I have operated a small international mail-order business for several years from the USA, and I've made some mistakes with orders, but more often I've seen postal services screw up (about 1% of orders don't make it at all, some that should take a 1-2 days to arrive have taken over a month!). I've had people claim the original AND the resent orders didn't arrive, forcing me to send an order out for a third time (so I've sent out 3x the merch and paid 3x the shipping cost -- which can be more than the merch, for international shipments). When that happens, I can't help wonder if the customer is scamming me.

I can attest to CoinMKT being an exchange between buyers and sellers. I placed a market-price limit order to buy BTC, then realized it wouldn't happen, because there are only a handful of other orders waiting to be filled (sign up and see the orders). I'm not sure when there will be enough volume to really do any trading, and yes, plenty of little bugs (and sounds like some TOS errors - good on you for actually reading and understanding them).
All that said, I'm happy to be part of the beta, even if it is with my money. I think encouraging an exchange like this is helpful to the longterm growth of Bitcoin. It's also fun to be one of the first to actually use a U.S. exchange that handles more than just Bitcoin. It's even cooler knowing they are just a 10 minute drive from my home (well, at least their mailbox is that close).

I've simply used my iPhone's web browser to pay or receive Bitcoin using online wallets. It's worked fine with several sites (Blockchain.info, Coinbase.com), I assume it would work with any online wallet, exchange, etc. You can use a separate QR code reader to scan, then just copy and paste the payment address to the payment field, if that's what you need to do (i bought my first New Liberty Dollar that way at a Bitcoin meetup).
Note that I have an issue where my Blockchain app doesn't work on my wifi network, but it works over wireless cell connection... Very strange.

I'm glad I didn't say more negative, because my issue was resolved. Turned out to be a very minor issue, but the error message made it sound like something that made me nervous (maybe the same thing has happened with other people). I think they just have a few things they need to tweak. The biggest issue trading LTC there might be they just don't have enough volume yet. Take a look at the open buy and sell orders, and see what you think.
I haven't funded ANY crypto exchange since Dwolla left the space, so I can't comment on what is best. But seems easy enough to buy Bitcoin on Coinbase, then go to any multi-coin exchange and trade BTC for LTC.
