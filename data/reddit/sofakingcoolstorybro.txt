thanks for the quick reply! so I tried to send money to my main wallet and ended up just paying the transfer fee but didn't receive the funds =(
can you ELI5 what i should do when I click addresses and notice all the previously used addresses appear. How do I transfer that to a current wallet so my wallet recognizes the new coins added from previous wallet

thank you so much for your time. so here's the run down. I'm running on tails and I clicked an address knowing that it has money in it and clicked "send from" and sent it to my current wallet. But it only charged me thrbtransferr fee and didn't send the remaining coins. I hope this makes sense

I think you where right, my mistske when retrieving funds wasn't requesting the exact amount I wanted transferred to current wallet.... or I just made a mistake and sent $309 to God knows where

yes they are. I just panicked when someone said they put $400 into an "old address"  and when I went to check it didn't show up and mg totals didn't change. so that's why I'm confused
