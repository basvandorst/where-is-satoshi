You're located in SE Asia? Of course, it's that cheap. I thought you were in America...

Breaking down what he wrote - they were planning to implement "Auto Finalize" &amp; a "Dispute Center" over the weekend. So it just happens that they put everything into HOT storage this same weekend. Then it just so happens the hackers decide to "let's test this transaction problem with bitcoin right now".
 Any responsible mod would disable any withdrawal once the whole transaction malleability problem came up this widespread.
Just looking at that - it cries bullshit. I'm sorry for whoever uses SR2.0, sorry you got your coins stolen. 
Playing the devil's advocate here tho - why would they want to steal the coins when they can easily make more if they keep the market up longer? Assuming they take a fee of ~1% for every transaction - they can easily make more if they properly maintain the site.
 I can see maybe they wanted to get out of the business and hide from LE so that they don't have to live in fear every single day.

Bet you they'll post "we found the hackers and got back 80% of the stolen bitcoins". Then they give it back to everyone thinking "crap this is bad, and everyone knows it's us". They'll create a story of some super hacker tracing the blockchain to a certain user, find their address, and there goes the story.

$ .75 cents for LUNCH?! What the... I get a bag of chips from the vending machine for $.85. My normal lunches are $10 for a decent lunch, $20 if I want something a bit higher quality. (SoCal)

1. I think he might have been at work during the day, so after he took a nap and decided to work on bitcoin/post on forums at night. Can work out - means he barely slept.
2. VPN? He worked for tech/defense, I'm sure it's not hard to do that.
3. Easy to write in many different ways.
4. One of his reviews was in German. 
I really hate the author of this article - they just put a target on this man's back even if he ISN'T the real SN. Goodbye to his private life/safety. I hope a real SN (or fake one) pops up and decides to do an online interview, so he is safe. 
I'm pretty furious at this.

Playing devil's advocate here,
If DSN was the real SN, it would be a good time for him to "donate" to himself to move some coins. This way, it would look like he's helping someone out, it actually allows SN to start moving some of his money. Albeit very little...

Honestly, it's not hard to obscure your writing with a multitude of styles.
it not hard to right like two different style for hiding your persons.
