As Much as i agree with You on the validity of your concerns about monetisation of public properties and right; Land ownership, rights and issues in general are outside of this scope.
Unfortunatly, lands always have owners. But in Many place the rightfull owner have difficulties to protect his lands. Most of the Time is the cliché "big compagny / cartel / corrupt state" againt local communauty )
This kind of tool, as well as accurate cadastre information and cartography, are essential.

Basically the guys splitted, and splitted again before the end of the first split, recursively. While transfering to third DAO on the fly. 
The bug was allowing the splitting before taking the amount.

i dont know about this specific prize, i saw that popping several times. I guess the podcast explain it in detail.
But, i just want to enphasis that there is no Nobel prise in Mathematic as well. Mathematic. Because Nobel was just not that into it.
So, Nobel not giving recognition to something is maybe not that big of a deal.
