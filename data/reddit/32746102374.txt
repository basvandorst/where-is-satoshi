Hope you know it's a derivative. It's not the artist that has the problem.

Run this resource intensive, expensive node for no reward *and* you get to pay for the privilege as well, awesome!

This would result in no listening nodes running at all.


It costs nothing to denial of service attack the network for a criminal who already owns a botnet. Would would they bother setting up bad nodes when you can just nuke the network from orbit? Bitcoin's peer to peer network is very vulnerable to DoS attacks. 


This would require nodes to keep indexes of these sort of transactions, which would not scale and would lead to even less nodes running. 


Not really. Nodes won't connect to very closely spaced peers, it's already very expensive to sybil a node. You need many IP addresses in many different ranges, and even then the impact on a particular person is almost nil, the best you can do is denial of service, so what's the point? There's cheaper and easier ways of doing that.

Masternodes just turn your proof of work into a crappy and complicated proof of stake, what's the point? Plus you're giving people an incentive to denial of service attack other masternodes to get a bigger profit. In their system master nodes now have the power to break consensus and invalidate otherwise valid blocks, it's horrific shoestring consensus.

That's trivial to get around by just proxying all requests to another real node, it's literally just a dumb pipe from A to B and then inject whatever malice you want to on top of that. Even more to the point, "proper" behaviour is pretty hard to gauge.

Make an account on the service, deposit money, see where it goes.

Remember when ghash.io [performed finney attacks against betting websites and stole millions of dollars worth of BTC]( Didn't seem to deter them, didn't seem to stop people form mining with them.

The checks do not guard against UTXO tampering and are not designed to. It's for sanity only.

In which case, denial of service is cheaper. You could DoS the bitcoin network with almost no resources at all, and no appreciable cost. Would be illegal of course, but that doesn't usually stop criminals from trying.

That's not right, lamport signatures will halve the security of the private key with every signature. If you sign enough times you effectively open the key up to an instant exhaustive attack. It's "standard" in that it'll be what Bitcoin uses when/if ECDSA is broken.

An unsigned transaction contains all the information it will when it's signed, it's just invalid because it has no signatures yet.

No, they're generally not interoperable. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 11:06:10
No, but you can see what the contents of the transaction is from the unsigned version.
