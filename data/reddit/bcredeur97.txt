Just contacted them! I hope everyone who sees this post does the same.
Hopefully they will release a statement at some point about it. I don’t think they realize how important it really is...

Lightning or blocksize increase... whatever needs to happen, needs to happen. whatever is best long term, because at the end of the day the long term is what will matter the most. 
but yeah i totally can see how bitcoin is in a bit of a pickle right now... 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:12:14
Boycott if you have to folks... don’t be afraid to move your money elsewhere. It’ll only benefit us all in the long term

So what is it like hodling a depreciating asset? 
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:20:14
Live in Louisiana. Never heard of it

Volume hasn’t quite shifted from big sell volume to growing buyer volume yet. 
When it does, the price should start to slowly creep up. 
Amazing what price hype does to ppl. It’s so quiet now compared to late last year/early this year. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:40:45
Nothing but 520 errors for me.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:54:51
it just isn't the same today... at least I don't feel like there is still money to be made in it. Maybe there is... I dunno. 
I remember at one point when we first got those 4 asic's they would make like $600 a day lol. Now they are useless.
I always feel like i'd just be way better off buying bitcoin or some other coin and just holding it. The incentive for mining isn't 100% there. Doesn't help that I got burned by butterfly labs with their late deliveries and mining with customer units. Had I spent the money on just bitcoin I'd have several hundred thousand right now lol
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:53:43
A little here. I’m still aggravated that there’s a fork of bitcoin competing with bitcoin. Should of never happened in the first place
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:59:58
haha yeah. I was very young getting into this (im currently 20 lol) and made a lot of stupid decisions... a lot of it was from lack of knowledge if I'm going to be honest... of what bitcoin actually was and why it was so important and why it had value in the first place. 
But hey! Got to make mistakes somewhere... Live and learn as they say. It's amazing what i've learned since 2011.
im just glad I never lost money. In fact I did make some... just not nearly as much as I should have. Never should of sold the 25 BTC I had at one point... and i've gone through way more bitcoin than that.. that was just the largest single balance I ever had lol
it still may yet not be too late for bitcoin to be a viable long term investment. I have hope.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:49:08
Even though butterfly-labs was quite an awful company....
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:24:46
Somewhere between $0 and $1 million
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:39:37
I'm at UL... in Informatics. Been overhearing conversations about Bitcoin and block-chain for the past year lol.
In not only my technical courses, but also a couple business ones including a management course of all things, the professor had mentioned it.
It's really taking off. Not just where you are. Here too! 
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:12:56
If you have free electricity, you can try mining. 
It does delay potential short term benefits but even if you buy bitcoin with that money YOU NEED TO BE IN IT FOR THE LONG TERM. Not 1 year, not 2 years. It’s an investment. Treat it like one. 
You may see more in the short term from mining but in the long term it’s better to buy and hold. 
Or if you’re super concerned, do a mix of both. No harm done there. You’ll quickly see what is the better option
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:17:29
You asking the question means you’ve basically made up your mind and are looking for confirmation, lol. If you want to, go for it. But bit of advice:
We still don’t really know what will happen to bitcoin in the end. This is something only time will tell. Therefore, do not risk no more than you can afford to risk. I wish I could go all in all day long, reality is not only am I scared to, it’s also not smart to.  Just be wise with your choices. It’s ok to be risky just make sure you can afford to lose what you risk! 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:11:17
Unless you bought them just to make USD. Which is why you’re selling them right now along with the tons of other people who you joined in on the hype with. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:00:33
I’m a man who wants an answer? That makes me a clown? Why? 
What has happened to the friendly community? Why do this to me? You should encourage me and point me in the right direction. 
Not tell me get out of here like I don’t belong... 
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:37:16
Dude I don’t know where your coming from. Again I’ll say I don’t want conflict, I don’t want people yelling at me telling me BCC is wrong. I could care less. I don’t even own any BCC... I’ve just been watching things unfold the way they are. Seen so many people get into bitcoin. Everything is growing so fast since when I first was introduced to bitcoin in 2011.
I just want solid information on what prevents people from going “oh this node is large, let’s just use this for my transaction to this other guy” because that can easily grow...it’s this that I can’t find an argument for.  All there is on google is stupid BCC people screaming to buy their stupid coin
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:08:48
Yes I understand this. I was hoping to avoid conflict. I just want to know the arguments on both sides. 
I have a hard time keeping up with news. I felt torn and here was a good place to find out what’s up. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:26:28
Is ASICBoost at a hardware or software level?
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:21:46
While it’s clear that you want me gone... just remember this:
People will no longer go to a store if as soon as they walk in the door an employee questions them with: “HEY I JUST SAW YOU ACROSS THE STREET AT OUR COMPETITORS. GET OUT” 
Even if they were just trying to simply buy and support a product.... they for sure won’t be supporting anything anymore. 
So I bid thee farewell with the following answer from YOU:  “since you have questions, get out of here and go support Bitcoin cash” 
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:47:09
Ease of use is arguably the most important thing right now. 
Normal people don’t want to understand anything technical. They just want their money to work. 
I think this should be focused on going forward. Whilst maintaining decentralization. Because that is very important
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:09:28
Thank you. That’s a lot to look through but I guess I’ll have to dig. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:11:23
And if you didn’t know, you’d be like “look man, I don’t know. But we can find out together” 
Then we’d be cooking something. 
So please... don’t be that way
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:24:46
That makes a lot of sense. So long as No one can ever force me to go through the “big guy”, correct? 
And thank you for being polite. Unlike some...
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:25:41
So that’s how they are getting their 16TH/s number... 14TH/s (antminer S9) + 20% is ~16.8TH/s 
So are they just selling reprogrammed antminers? Lol. They look the same..  just different logo 
@_date: 2018-03-06 03:42:03
I think it will. As much as I don't want it to :/ 
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:35:24
You’re right, you didn’t. My point was to give you valid reasoning of what people in other places are doing. Either screaming Bitcoin cash or screaming against it. 
I don’t care about “bitcoin trash” in and of itself. I just want an answer. 
So while you’re calling me a troll, you’ll notice in another thread in this very same post another user gave me a good little explanation and shared some links. THAT GOT ME SOMEWHERE.
But you, simply want to kick me out. I’m telling you... just like that one other person. if you want this community to succeed we cannot be like this. It will only tear us apart. No one will want in to a place like this. 
Encourage people. Give them good reasoning to stay.  Be valuable. Love your neighbor. 
All this hatred only tears the world we live in further and further apart. And it makes me sad.
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:29:55
I've been around. Just not on reddit the entire time... only recently I started posting on reddit really. if you look at my post history, you'll see I don't post here much.
Really I have basic googl'ing, my twitter news feed that I'm starting to hate, and my busy life. that's about it... 
I don't think we should be harsh to people no matter who they are. it doesn't help anything.
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:31:14
Just to be clear: i just want an answer. 
Not here to make FUD. Not here to support any other coins. Or really anything... just want to know what’s going on and why things are being done the way they are. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:17:29
Geez this is a fiery subject... people messaging me telling me I’ll get banned. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:12:13
blockchain.info has been around for a long time. so some people did keep coins there.
but as others said, you had to buy on Mt. Gox pretty much
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:08:28
Jeez dude. I don’t know what you want from me. 
And I sure hope you dont do this to others. If anything if someone brand new came on here they’d be more welcomed by the Bitcoin cash community than this. Do you want that? 
Look me up. I have nothing against bitcoin. Just a young man with young man questions. Seen this question posed, I just want a clear answer. If you truly knew Bitcoin you’d give that answer to me? Right? 
But no, instead you chew me out. If everyone was like this, we’d get nowhere. Where I come from, it’s in everyone’s best interest for people to help people. That’s how we grow.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:13:14
so it's done. locked in. 
Now what?
