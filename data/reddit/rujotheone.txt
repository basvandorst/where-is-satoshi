This is my concern also. Already on mainnet SLEEPYARK seems to be the most connected node. Such nodes may become points of centralization

What I envision too. Lightning on mobile phones. Every bitcoin user having a channel open on the network with his/her mobile phone wallet

This was me just last week. My friend was blaming me for him not buying when it went up to 14k because I said it might drop

My mum just called too and told me to sell my bitcoins because the owner of bitcoin is selling his. I swear this happened to me 30 minutes before I got on Reddit

The real **work** is in figuring out the right thing to concentrate in/risk it for.

The unintended effect of bitcoin is spurring investment in renewable energy. Renewable energy has the problem of variable energy consumption. This means they must have a way to store excess energy leading to further investments in storage. We could see generation companies begin to mine bitcoin as a way to "store".

If someone receives a large inflow of money, bankers start getting suspicious and may freeze your account. They don't want people getting rich like them.  It is the way the world is  now. This is why we bitcoin

Most likely the North Korea tensions. Koreans are the ones buying bitcoin

Any chance the algorithms/protocols already used for normal TCP/IP routing can be adopted and modified?
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:57:18
Maybe. Bitcoin gives us a socio-political experiment. Can humanity thrive without clear-cut leadership?
@_date: 2019-08-31 18:58:03
I like this idea. Decentralized cities all belonging to the virtual country of bitcoin. If that is the case then we should rally round and create guidelines on how these places will be built worldwide. Bitcoiners then can come together in a country and build theirs by buying large amounts of land with their (hopefully) new found wealth.

I expect this to run in the background of wallets if it is implemented. It will just be an option to opt-in when setting up your wallet.

When I say that Satoshi is/was an era defining genius(I believe he is a man) my friends don't get the gravity.  I generally like to read up on inventions and discoveries and how they affect the future and I class Bitcoin as up there 
I like your point about negative interest rates. The average Joe does not understand how messed up our financial system is. Valuations are based on interest rates, how do you value a stock et al on a negative number? (Read DCF model)
I would not assume Satoshi will not trade his coins in the future though.
@_date: 2019-08-31 18:44:15
It is interesting reading this now and bitcoin already passed $14k and is currently $9k6

Because they won't have control. Every tech firm that wants to get into fintech knows bitcoin is the obvious solution, especially for remittances, but they don't want to use it because they will not have control of the network. 
My prediction is that one day we will see a tech firm that will plug its wallet app for international transfers into national bitcoin exchanges and will achieve this. I just hope it will be open sourced.

I have a contrarian view on where it should be built. I think an underdeveloped country is better. That way the citadel can be built with bitcoin as its money in its foundation. Of course, more bitcoin will have to be spent on security than necessary because such a place will be under constant attacks by the underworld

Honestly my major challenge is the initial syncing. Downloading the blockchain is too expensive
@_date: 2019-10-21 07:52:04
This makes sense. Will this require a hard fork to implement the reversal mechanism?

You assume we won't increase the blocksize in the future

What they are probably doing is suppressing the price using CME futures

If regular people don't use bitcoin, it will not go anywhere. This view is similar to unix/linux fans who hate Bill Gates for 'dumbing down' OSes. Also I did not go into detail about RAID and smart contracts because I felt the post was getting too long but trust me it is not black box worship

I have developed a strategy of buying the dip but spending a percentage of my cash position that is directly proportional to the percentage of the drop. That is; if bitcoin drops by X% i spend KX% of my cash where X is the drop and K is my risk factor

I think he should start investing in advanced technology in the areas of computer memory, processing power(CPUs)  and networking speed (at least that is what I would do). Limitations in these areas are what deter people from running a full node and also scaling bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-21 07:39:50
Tested this idea, it is better to not sell when it goes up or to reduce the percentage you sell
@_date: 2019-10-21 07:56:21
I am talking of actual $ costs. I don't live in a rich country so the blockchain is like a month's salary.
I will try a pruned node
@_date: 2019-10-20 09:00:15


The system I am proposing is something in the middle. Non-custodial as in you are responsible for your password. Custodial as in the network keeps a backup of your seed. The reason why I suggested a password system is because the average nocoiner really doesn't want to deal with phrases. Obviously this system will be less secure.
I also acknowledge the problem of passwords (yes we need something better than passwords in general IT security). 
Your time lock idea is a good one and I have seen it floating around but what if the person is a loner?

One thing no one is talking about is that phones and other hand held computers will be powerful enough to mine and verify bitcoin around the time the last bitcoin is mined. Imagine a world where every smartphone owner is a node and miner
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:07:50
I believe this is when we truly go mainstream. Every phone running a full node
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:52:13
But the owners are reachable

Is this not against the principles of bitcoin(censorship resistance)?

Interestingly ancient civilisations used to have a period of debt forgiveness. I believe countries may have to cancel debt on a large scale else it will forcefully collapse on itself

Your last point is the scariest. Considering the hate billionaires get today, I imagine a future where whales are hated as much or more. The masses may start voting in socialists who promise to forcefully redistribute bitcoins.

I believe the next recession will mostly affect banks badly. Many countries will resort to bail ins so I will advise people to keep very little money in the banks
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:38:46
Dude you need to calm down and take life more easily. The volatility in bitcoin will reduce as adoption grows and the market cap increases thus market manipulation will reduce. The hodl mentality makes sense because of ingerent scarcity built in by Nakamoto. Also bitcoin is money and money is supposed to be traded, for other items or for other types of money. Now if you understand geopolitics and understand the petrodollar and you were building a system that could one day go against the dollar you will do so anonymously lest you attract the attention of the powers that be in this world. A good reading to start you off is 'The economic hitman '

This! I am pretty sure one major reason we moved up so fast is because of leveraged shorters getting squeezed but they won't learn and will try it at say 20k. Then the speed at which we move will be all over the news.

True. However there are calls now for some type of socialism. Eg AOC. If we enter a far more unequal system, it could be worse

This has been the idea in my mind. Imagine a world were every personal device; wearables, IOT not just phones is a bitcoin node. This is why it is was key to taper the blockchain size until computing capacity exceedingly surpasses the blockchain.
