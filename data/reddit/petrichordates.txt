Im sure it is. But if Putin is personally excited about something, that's probably not because it's in your favor.
@_date: 2018-03-07 10:11:11
You've done nothing to challenge any points. Your elaborate way of saying "Fake News" isn't as convincing as you think.

The people with all the rubles likely bought in already.

I don't think Putin gives 2 shits about the value of the dollar. He has much better ways to undermine a nation.
Regardless, his primary interest in cryptocurrency is undoubtedly because it allows him to hide and launder his vast wealth. His money, and that of his oligarchs, is much more important to him than any silly idealogical battle.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:11:54
Putin cares about his money, not this idealogical battle you seem to think is so important. The man doesn't plan that far ahead.
China is a whole different world though, they're planning for the long-term.
Your concern over "poking the bear" is nonsense though. With successful leadership, the eagle would easily strangle the bear. The only thing the eagle needs to fear is the panda.

Dude, you can't declare "there's no reasoning with you" when you didn't even try! What kind of BS is that? All you've done is attack me since my first post, you didn't even provide one single substantive response to any point I made.
Maybe you're right, there's no reasoning with me if you can't even bother to able to reason yourself.
And what the hell does age have to do with interpretations of geopolitics? You're not even bothering to make sense.
Considering the only thing you seem to do is spend time discussing cryptocurrencies, maybe your purview isn't as wide as you think.

Beijing needs centralized control, cryptocurrency isn't something they'd be a fan of..
I'm not sure why they'd be antagonistic to USD hegemony? That's most of their income. Even better that it's a relatively stable, non-manipulated currency.

Dollars aren't easier to launder than Bitcoin..
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:15:32


Lol you're a joke.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:49:36
Weren't you the one who was triggered by seeing Trump mentioned? The whole chain starts with you..

That's not anti-Russian. Russians aren't guilty of anything.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:47:56
You're not very [well informed,]( are ya buddy?
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:29:54
I suspect you believe a lot of nonsense stuff and have no credible reason to believe them.
I've heard a lot of things in my lifetime, but the only people who challenge the credibility of the NYT are people who uncritically believe in the words of conmen. Your words are quite similar to the gullible denizens of r/conspiracy.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:41:57
You've obviously never listened to the man's words.

The very act of becoming president doesn't make him smart. Especially considering the character of people that voted him in.
It's odd that you thought that was some sort of evidence? As if there's a presidential intelligence test? (gods we wish)
@_date: 2018-03-07 10:09:01
Russia deals in natural gas, not oil.

This is not a good thing for Bitcoin bro.
The ring leader of a corrupt mafia state legitimizes a currency which allows him to more easily launder his nation's stolen wealth?
That's not a positive development for cryptocoin. If anything, it *delegitimizes* the currency.

You're literally comparing a former constitutional law professor and former editor of the Harvard Law Review to some guy who inherited millions and still somehow had to do file for bankruptcy multiple times.
Something tells me you're not looking at this objectively.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:18:41
What narrative? Please point out someone saying exactly what I said.
And yet you still never made a substantive argument..
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:43:51
You didn't need to read through my comments, you just needed to point out why my argument was wrong. You did not.
I live in a swing state, where only 30k votes changed the course of the election. So yes, it probably does matter.
Are you always so cynical?
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:36:10
Um, yeah?
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:19:12
No decision Putin makes is in your best interest.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:24:05
McCarthism is an ideaological battle against communism.
This is acknowledging that the head of a Mafia state doesn't have your best interests in mind.
They're wildly different concepts, with the sole common-ground being their geography.
Your comment is dumb.
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:12:49
Living across various cities in the same country doesn't expand your worldview. 
You literally laughed at people thinking voting matters, that's cynical.
You *still* haven't even attempted to tackle my argument. Apparently attacking the messenger is easier? Is that what they told you in all those blue, red, black and white US cities?
