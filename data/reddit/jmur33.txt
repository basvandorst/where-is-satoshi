Funny thing is I have a BSc degree.  My brain wasn't working today I guess.   In financial systems money is always stored an integer, to avoid floating point rounding errors.  So in your account there is no decimal point, just satoshi values.  The decimal point is added only for formatting purposes.  That is what confused me for a moment!

Why do you call them scammers and shills?  Bitcoin Cash is legit, just following a different tech philosophy
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:26:50
Lets say that "slices of banana" are a currency, to fit with your example.  To follow your instructions, we'll start off with 1 banana.  In other words, there is 1 slice of banana.  When you cut it into 5, now you have 5 slices of banana.   Then cut all those slices in half again and there are now 10x as many units of currency.
If you add more divisions to bitcoin, then you are increasing the number of units of currency available
There are currently 2100000000000000 (14 zeros) pieces of bitcoin that can theoretically exist.
If you add one more decimal division past satoshi, then there are 21000000000000000 (15 zeros) pieces of bitcoin that can exist.  Now there are have 18900000000000000 (15 zeros) more pieces of currency in circulation!  Wohoo we just printed a load more money!

I don't think that's what they're doing at all.  They think that they _are_ bitcoin

How is it a rip off?  One of the main philosophies of open source software is that you can fork it and modify to your own requirements.  It's not a rip off.

Why does this sub give bitcoin cash such a hard time?  I'm newish to this game.  I understand the technical implications of the hard fork in August but not the war between the two forks

Surely the blocks are of similar length?  Because of difficulty, more hash power != longer chain, right?

I have heard someone say this before.  How is that any different to Zimbabwe printing ever larger notes? If you add a new decimal then suddenly there is 10x as many units of the currency in circulation
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:15:26
But they do not think that they are an altcoin. Bcashers think that they _are_ bitcoin, and Bitcoin core has stolen the brand by choosing not to follow the hard fork
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:29:01
There are several alt coins solving these problems right now.  I would guess they are the reason that BTC has lost so much ground in the last few weeks.

Thanks for the succinct reply.  It makes sense now!  Is deflation is desirable trait of a currency?  Doesn't that encourage owners of the currency to hold on to it rather than use it for transactions?

Where do I go to learn?  I am relatively new to crypto but I've been reading a lot on the BTC/BCH debacle.  I watched Banking on Bitcoin in November and that's when I got involved.  I'm starting to lean towards BCH, mostly because of this video:   Can someone debunk the points made in the video for me?
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:00:14
Well surely their plan is to rebrand to Bitcoin again once they establish dominance over core, in both hash power and adoption.

The phrase "original bitcoin" is confusing to me.  Segwit and LN seem to be significant changes to the original, while increased block sizes were planned from the beginning.  I suppose the backwards compatibility is key.  Is the first version of bitcoin be able to run on today's network?  In other words, has BTC only ever had soft forks?
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:12:34


Well if you introduce a change that is not compatible with Satoshi's original code/protocol, then that's a hard fork.  In a hard fork situation you have to convince the majority of the network to upgrade their software.  If they refuse then you have just created another Bitcoin Cash

Depends who you ask.  BCH guys would disagree!  Well to be fair they think that they are pro-bitcoin.  They think that BCH is the real bitcoin

The difficulty that I am seeing now is that both and are giving me the same story about the other.  Both say that the people owning their opposing fork are dishonest and just gearing up to steal my money and destroy Bitcoin.  Both say that the opposing subreddit is "censored".  I have no idea who is right.  Perhaps both.

OK, thanks.  That is part of the protocol that I was unaware of, I assume it was block number.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:01:27
I guess they assumed that &gt;51% of the network would have followed their hard fork, and that they would be "Bitcoin".

BTC, BTG and BCH share the vast majority of their blockchain.  They are all flavours of Bitcoin with incompatible protocols.  The terminology I'm using is from modern unix based operating systems.  In the beginning there was one UNIX.  Now there are literally hundreds of distributions of unix based operating systems.  They share many components but ultimately they are separate pieces of software.  This includes Android, iOS, MacOS and all flavours of Linux.  
The Bitcoin family is similar to the unix story.  The blockchain, the protocols and the software have a shared history.  All of the forks *are* Bitcoin.  That is the reality now whether you like it or not.   The best way forward is to recognise that Bitcoin is now a *family* of currencies of which there are currently three distinct and incompatible members.


That's fine, all I'm saying is that BTC needs some differentiator.  "Bitcoin Core" is already used by some people to refer to BTC that's why I mentioned it.

Of course it is.  It's as generic as they come.  Are you daft?
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:04:19
OK, that would be good.  The problem is that nobody is calling it bcash apart from on pro-BTC forums.  Many exchanges and merchants use "Bitcoin Cash", and some even just use "Bitcoin" for BCH

@_date: 2018-02-27 11:38:09
I see.  There are two main ways to store a number - integer or floating point.  In Java/C, A long is just an integer with more bits and a double is a float with more bits.  You're right about the decimal point being only for display but they definitely use integers to store the value
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:18:03
Nice one.  As a power user I'll stay with mac too thanks
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:14:27
Personally I like the suffix for clarification.  I know that 90% of the time Bitcoin refers to BTC and Bitcoin Cash to BCH, but I honestly like it when "Cash" or "Core" are explicitly included.  There can be no confusion.
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:58:58
You are validating my point.  As a consumer you need to conduct more research to understand the differences.  From what I can work out, there are now flavours of bitcoin, all derived from the same protocol and forked from the same blockchain.  Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold.  They all fall under the umbrella term "Bitcoin", so BTC needs to have a differentiator to alleviate some of the confusion to new consumers.   The implicit omission of "Gold" or "Cash" isn't enough.  There needs to be another term to describe BTC in a consumer friendly way that removes all doubt.   The presence of coexisting forks is bad for new consumers, but implicit naming just makes it worse.  "Core" seems to be quite a popular term at the moment.  It's memorable and hints at something technical without actually saying anything at all.
Personally I would rather there were no coexisting forks at all, but it seems unlikely that the forks will just "go away".  I suspect that we will see more forks in the future, it seems like a nice way for people already holding a lot of BTC to boost their earnings.  The trick is convincing others that the fork is necessary and that the forked coins are valuable

I'm trying to say that as a developer macOS gives me everything that I need.  On what basis do you think are Macs bad for development?  Have you tried using macOS in anger?  I'm not sure what you're talking about regarding brew, it's a good package manager.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:14:46
No they should be integers to avoid floating point precision errors.  Why do you think doubles?
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:59:24
