Bitcoin is a strong option for payments today and in the future.  Many businesses pay 3% or more for credit/debit card transactions, plus fees, and chargebacks.  With bitcoin, there's no chance of chargebacks (involuntarily that is) and the cost of sending bitcoin from one person to another is a few pennies.  
Bitcoin transfers happen instantly. Need to send money to someone far away?  Traditional banking can take days.  Bitcoin is within a few minutes.
Bitcoin isn't owned by a company or government, and is decentralized, so no one individual can take control of it.
Bitcoin is finite.  There can only ever be 21 million units.  They are divisible to make exact payment possible, however no one can create more, meaning inflation isn't possible.
Bitcoin is your money, your way, without asking a bank for permission on how it can be sent, when it can be sent and how long the bank can place  "hold" on it...whatever the fuck that means.

honestly if your idea ever came to reality, it would really be the death of bitcoin.  I wouldn't want it.  I would go back to FIAT.  Your idea smells of "colored coins".  I don't want any 3rd party bullshit. I don't want some "Agency" telling me what bitcoins are legit and which are stolen.  One of the most attractive features of bitcoin is the idea that there isn't some asshole third party giving me permission to use MY FUCKING MONEY.  To answer your question, "wouldn't it be cool...?" : NO, it would suck.

perceived value?
Yahoo executives got way ahead of themselves in acquiring Broadcast.com, an online television site founded by Mark Cuban, for $5.7 billion in 1999. Slow dial-up connections made watching video a test of patience as did the laughably meager library of shows (think 1960-era monster movies and Victoria's Secret fashion shows). The service soon disappeared, as did the executives who engineered the deal.

I mine alt coins and dump for bitcoin, because I missed the early bitcoin mining days, with cheap hardware.  This won't last long though, alts are like penny stocks, insane risk/reward stuff, many people losing money.  Once people see that bitcoin will be the clear cryptocurrency winner in this space, alts will likely disappear and the profitability of mining and dumping for bitcoin will diminish.

They're going to be used to build the usage base, think of it as a company building a bigger customer base.  This is likely very good.  If you read the statement from the company you'll see that their intentions are to work towards spreading usage of bitcoin globally.  That's great.
@_date: 2014-05-25 04:23:25
harsh reality is that we need to make bitcoin simpler to use and understand.  Currently the people who understand bitcoin tend to be above average with respect to intelligence, education, financial means etc.  If you're a mid level IQ blue collar worker..comprehending magic internet money is still a tough sell.  There is a massive percentage of the population that gets up, goes to work for an hourly wage, and gets paid at the end of the week.  Their money is reasonably accessible, their checks get deposited direct deposit, and they have a debit card that they can use almost anywhere, for anything locally.  Until bitcoin is as easy to use as a debit card then it's an uphill battle.  Bitcoin is currently overly complex.  You might be overestimating your friends and their ability to do basic math, understand technology or something similar.  
Bitcoin REALLY needs to follow the KISS model, and soon... or it's fucked.

dogecoin is not up and coming, it was a passing fad, if you look at the numbers... the pump and dumpers have made their quick buck and doge will now slowly rot away to nothing.

that's exactly what I'm suggesting.  don't feel too bad, happened to me when I got sloppy and used the same password multiple places, i have a few gpu mining rigs, and one of them got owned.  I keep my mining rigs outside my home (offsite if you will) so one day during a routine checkup connecting with with a VNC client, I log in to find that someone had setup bitminter on one of my machines.  I redid all my security at that point.  bitcoin is big money right now, and lots of small time douchebags are scanning and trying random attacks to build botnets and use the bandwidth/hashrate to build mining botnets, just redo your setup, never use any of the passwords you had on that machine again, change the pwds for anything that uses those passwords and use 2fa on everything you do.

@_date: 2014-04-27 15:46:46
There's many examples explaining it here.
If I have a wallet with 10 "clean" BTC in it, and I receive 5 BTC that are "tainted" whether it's stolen, or from some source that isn't approved by whatever bullshit 3rd party is approving them.  Well, now I have a wallet with 15 BTC in it, and I spend 7.5 BTC.  Did I spend the 5 that are tainted or did I just spend 7.5 BTC of the 10 that were clean?
No, no this is a terrible idea.  If I have to validate that my coins are clean, I'll just simply abandon bitcoin.  
I'm not going ask someone permission to spend my money.  I'm not going to validate my money.
Fuck this idea.

Hi, welcome to That said, most people like it if you go to to talk about things like should I buy or sell, market predictions etc.  There's no way of knowing what the price of bitcoin will do.  is typically used for news of developments in bitcoin related to the actual protocol, businesses that are starting to accept it, government relations with respect to bitcoin etc.

Bitcoin is going to sidestep the existing financial industry, only participating in the parts that it has to in order to grow larger.  Part of the idea behind bitcoin is that we don't need painful, choking regulations destroying every inch of business with endless bullshit/red tape which only serves as a means of power transferrence to banksters and bureaucrats.  These supposed "regulations" you post here... they're antiquated, won't work, can't work and will stifle innovation and economy if imposed.
Simply put, your suggested ways...aren't going to happen.
There is good news though, Mr. Lawsky:  These matters, they really aren't up to you.  You can legislate all you want.  It just doesn't work that way any more.  You won't be allowed to cater to your bankster cronies anymore.  Go bail out a bank or whatever the fuck it is you do.  Bitcoin is going to move on without you, faster than you can, in places you have no control over, and in the end, we're all going to laugh at you.

Please don't do that.  Instead, couldn't it be spent on marketing for bitcoin awareness?  I'm sure that anything from google adwords, to targeted leaflet mailings could be done with the money to promote usage of bitcoin.  Heck, do a billboard like we've seen, just do it in another major city. What about putting up a billboard in NYC?  Boston?  London?  just to name a few.  There's a ton of different ways that fund could be used to promote bitcoin awareness.

I've used Gyft @ Target a ton, like over $4000 in the past year, I did a major move and Gyft/Target was a life saver.  
Here's a tip that speeds things up.  Pull up the gift card on your screen and take a screen shot of it prior to going to the check out line.  Save a picture of the giftcard instead of waiting for the gyft app to load.  It saves a ton of awkwardness if your phone won't load.  
I've never had a problem with the cashier entering the numbers, so I'm not sure how that worked out. Is it at all possible you mixed up the gift card numbers?  Also I've found a bit of delay with some Gyft accepting stores if you try to buy the cards right away, some of them need a couple hours to show up in the gift card system for the store.

Imagine I'm a rich family member overseas in Australia.  You need to borrow $5000, and I've agreed to send it to you.  You need it today.  Sending it with bitcoin means you'll have it in your account in minutes for just a few pennies of transaction cost.  Risk of theft during the transaction is virtually 0.
I can backup my bitcoin wallet.  Can you backup your cash if you lose a wallet full of cash.
Imagine it's a 95 degree day.  You own a convenience store.  Imagine a big sweaty truck driver coming in to buy some things with cash...that he pulled out of the same jeans he's been wearing for a week.....or you could have a point of sale bitcoin payment scanner that he scans his phone with.  You don't have to touch his dirty, sweaty money.  The money is transferred to your accounts immediately, and there's no physical cash you have to now transport to the bank.
Bitcoin means I have exact change every time.
Bitcoin means I don't have to wait for some bullshit bank period of time while the bank uses my money to make interest during a holding period, under the guise of security checks.

bitpay free account is cheaper than a merchant account (1% processing fee) 
bitcoin payments can never have chargebacks unless they're voluntarily done by the business.
Immediate settlement, you receive your money same day with bitpay, settled in dollars (this assumes you're in the united states) the same day.
If you're outside the USA, then you still have the bitcoin in your account faster than credit card companies that can take over a month to pay out.
there's more reaons, but just go to bitpay's website and watch the videos, it's easier.

the level of computer power you need to mine by yourself now, and actually get a considerable (if any) payout, is very very high.  This is because of the difficulty level that bitcoin is currently at for mining.  This is a good thing because it makes bitcoin strong for a few reasons, which would be hard for me to explain since I'm not a super expert on how that works, it's just my understanding of it.  By pooling your computing resources, you can expect a steadier, albeit smaller, payout, but there's a chance you'll never get anything mining by yourself because of how hard it is to mine at this point, if you mine solo.
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:15:16

Am I correct in assuming that I have to go to a website, and redeem the $100 at the current price when I'm home in front of a computer?  Or will the purchase of the card lock the amount of BTC I get at the time of purchase?

If they actually completed the sale, then they're the first Toyota dealer I've heard of to actually use bitcoin in a purchase.

It comes down to personal responsibility.  There's cold storage options, there's 2 factor authentication, there's common sense.  Instead of relying on government and big business to be responsible for you, you'll have to do it yourself.  It's a little more work, but you also don't have to explain yourself as much when it comes to *your* money.  I personally would rather never use a bank again.  I hate having to share my personal information with bank tellers, and pay their fees for everything.  I'll bank on my own, keep my fees,  If bitcoin was mainstream we wouldn't need banks anymore.

But in response, it was my pleasure, I love the concept of bitcoin.  I've had the most miserable experiences in my life because of banks and merchant accounts and credit cards.. I hate the banking system as a whole...because they've apparently bought out the government and we're all stuck with it... bitcoin appears to have a real chance of piercing through the banksters walled garden they have us all in.  I hope fiat goes the way of Scrip when scrip screwed over all the coal miners and factory workers... bitcoin seems like a chance for a "do-over" with the financial system.

@_date: 2013-11-13 17:31:24
youtube is helpful, but watch a bunch to get a general idea and verify information from a few sources.
coinbase works well, I use them frequently, for buying and selling bitcoin against the US dollar, in the United States.
I've used localbitcoins with positive results, but the prices tend to be considerably higher than market rate, and I'd recommend using someone who's good at contacting via phone first before transacting.
I use multibit as a wallet, and secure bitcoins there in a computer that I only connect to the internet for moving coins, I then disconnect it from the internet.
Use 2 factor authentication.  Google has a free app for both the droid and iphone platforms that will allow this.  If you don't know what that is, read up, it strengthens security considerably when properly used.

If I'm running a single mom/pop pizza place or some other small time retail setup, I'm not going to have the budget to build some sort of "in house" payment processor.  I'm going to setup with bitpay or the like and be thankful that someone else spent the money to set that up and for $30 a month, someone else can manage the payment processor side of things.  Small businesses don't setup their own merchant services networks... they hire some outside company to set them  up for credit cards, debit etc.  They'll do the same with bitcoin.

Another couple years and "cards" are going away.  Just look at Gyft.  Physical gift cards are toast... going the way of blockbuster video.

anything that zerocoin has, that's SUPER amazing.... will either be updated into existing bitcoin protocol ...or it will be illegal in so many places it won't be feasible to use.  
I wish...that there was a way for bitcoin to be super anonymous, in my opinion, it can't be.  I believe a nation has to have a  basic set of laws to protect people because otherwise we will all overwhelmingly dodge taxes completely, or so egregiously that schools and roads will fall to ruin.  
Let's not confuse things, I think governments, by and large, are bloated, messy piles of misappropriated funds and scams.
They will not let us just simply avoid taxes.  If bitcoin, or any other coin for that matter because a bulletproof way of tax evasion, it will be it's undoing.  The government will implement whatever procedures it needs to to stop such behavior once it hits a tipping point.  
so, in a simple TL;DR  No, Zerocoin doesn't threaten bitcoin.  
Bitcoin will be the big winner, with people perhaps diversifying risk of bitcoin with litecoin.  There won't be any other big players in crypto, at least not from my POV.

Bitcoin is money that isn't issued by a government.  Bitcoin has a limited supply, the opposite of government currency.  Bitcoin is also it's own payment system.  Bitcoin is not a business. Bitcoin has no central authority.  Bitcoin itself cannot be hacked.  Bitcoin is the biggest computer network aside from the actual internet, ever.  Bitcoin is global.  Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed involuntarily.  Bitcoin is fractional.  Banks should be scared of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck.

I disagree with those who call litecoin "just for speculation"  because it's based on a different algorithm, it provides a hedge against bitcoin in the even that a fatal flaw in bitcoin was ever discovered... while I also hold alot of BTC and don't think this is a big risk, it just seems like a market for crypto with competition is good, in the long run, for the health of btc as well as ltc.... some comparisons...
home depot/lowes
mcdonalds/burger king/ wendys
i think that while these are companie, not currency, comparison can be drawn, in that they each offer comparable products to their competitor, but are always trying to "one-up" the competition with the latest innovation.  i think the existence of LTC will drive crypto currency to new heights because it will force devs on both sides to compete and hope to drive attention to their "brand" if you will.

I'm sure there's a way to do it.  For example, foodler takes bitcoin, but it's by using foodler points.  Why couldn't there be Uber points?  It would encourage people to keep using Uber, just like foodler points have kept me ordering my takeout with Foodler.  If you're frequently using car services like Uber, you could have points in your account like that, it'd be good for Uber and Bitcoin.

If you have a smart phone (droid or iphone) you can download a bitcoin wallet for free, that generate's a QR code (a square code that translates to your bitcoin address) and start accepting bitcoins in person that way.

I've held a bunch of bitcoin(enough to buy a car, not a house) through the $1200 and back era... we're just getting started... overstock popped, exchanges popping up globally, target on gyft, home depot on egifter, bitcoin has just begun, 2014 is going to be a banner year.  Once amazon sees overstock, they'll have to get on board.  Once Walmart sees losing market to Target, they'll get on board.  It's cheaper to accept than credit cards.  You'll see.  This is just the beginning.

If you both own businesses, let me help you understand from my perspective.  I hold a decent (read less than a million, more than enough to matter to a business) worth of bitcoins. I just moved this week.
I spent while moving $1000 on Target gift cards with bitcoin via GYFT
I spent $1000 on Home Depot cards via GYFT
I spent $150 on CVS pharmacy via GYFT
$500 for my girlfriend to go to Crate &amp; Barrel via Gyft
I googled EVERYWHERE trying to find a place to buy furniture with bitcoin, but didn't have much luck, but would have preferred to use bitcoin to buy furniture
I buy lunch on Foodler all the time with bitcoin
When the weekend comes, and its time to go out maybe for a date or something, I google search and see if any new restaurants in the Boston Area (where I'm from) have started taking bitcoin that I might want to go to.
Bitcoin is real, and by accepting it via bitpay you risk no loss to market volatility.  You also open yourself to a huge group of people who believe in bitcoin and are searching for places to spend their money.  Best of luck to you.
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:11:42

no one at coinbase is stealing.  Their support is lacking because they're a startup that has grown stupid super insanely fast and they are struggling to keep up with demand.  Don't be paranoid.  I had an issue with coinbase once.  I wrote to their support.  I got a response, but it was 30 hours later.  For now, that's bitcoin, because the entire bitcoin community is growing and we're all having to deal with a bit of pain as things grow.  Stop posting immature snippy comments and work on contacting coinbase, they're the only ones who can help you anyway.

realistically what I do for my head is a I look for a sort of "rolling average" as far as bitcoin related items go... there's going to be outliers in both directions making wild claims about going to the moon or going to hell in a handbasket...I think reality is we're going to see nice healthy adoption happen over the course of the next few years and the patient ones who buy, hold, spend some to support the market and continue to buy and replace as they spend, will be rewarded for their patience.

my assessment is based on how ripple is premined and the market for it is already cornered.  
I get it though, based on your comment history it's pretty easy to guess that you hold a bunch of xrp and are just looking out for your investment interests.  I understand, I hold bitcoin.
That said, anything that ripple can add to crypto, can just be added to the bitcoin protocol over time.  Ripple, just like litecoin, feathercoin, worldcoin, dogecoin...just .. isn't going to happen

a variant of this question has been asked quite a few times.
There is a consortium of developers involved with bitcoin.  If bitcoin is found to be missing a key piece of tech or innovation, it's highly likely that this new found needed *whatever* could be incorporated into the existing bitcoin platform.  This would in turn keep all of the existing infrastructure supporting the "current" bitcoins relevant and there likely be limited, short term, loss of value.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:32:10

While I can't speak for everyone, I say it because I want the stores to understand that bitcoin is looking for acceptance.  These stores have to be selling giftcards at a discount to the giftcard merchants, otherwise the merchants wouldn't be in business.  If the stores were to just accept bitcoin directly, they would save money by cutting out the middle man, and this would raise the stores profits.  I'd much rather just pay directly with bitcoin, and hopefully the stores that don't accept bitcoin yet will hear from enough people like me and start just accepting bitcoin directly.

Other than people who are bummed they missed the early BTC train, is there any real reason for using alternative crypto currencies?  I've been watching LTC, FTC and WDC just to name a few, and they all just sort of smell like BTC, with a different mining restriction, which to me, doesn't seem like it will be enough of a differentiation (non ASIC mining) 
Are any alternative crypto currencies SAFER than BTC?
SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER PROCESSING than BTC?
or anything else?  
To me, it just seems like BTC is the only one people will need, and everyone else is just mining, and pump/dumping hoping to market time their way into the BTC market.

it's got lots of benefits for both ends, it's as easy to carry as a debit card, but can be password protected, it's fast, no charge backs for the merchant, immediate settlement vs waiting 30-60 days for credit card processors to pay you, and many others.

@_date: 2013-12-09 16:45:19
you don't have to hold it to accept it!  You can simply setup a free bitpay  account which is cheaper than credit cards.  At the end of every business day, any funds paid via bitpay are settled, if you choose, in dollars.  You don't have to risk anything in the market with respect to volatility.  When someone pays you in bitcon with bitpay, you have your account configured to pay out in USD, and your rate is locked in and bitcoin is converted to dollars on the fly!

I'm a long time believer in bitcoin, not because I believe in the bitcoin community(even though I do), but because I see big money VC's putting money up.  Big money players like the Circle group putting up millions of USD into things like exchanges, payment processing services and other bitcoin related services.  Big money investors are creating infrastructure to support the concept of bitcoin, and that is what gives me confidence in the long term idea of bitcoin.

I've been very happy with Coinbase, and even though I had some trouble today, I'll continue using it.  Apparently there was some sort of conflict with using Chrome to access Coinbase today, but after a little reddit reading I cleared my browser and everything worked after that.  I've seen enough of Coinbase support here in the forums and on other sites to at least be ok keeping a couple BTC there.  I use Coinbase for buys and sells, been happy overall.

ripple is premined, centralized, privately owned and therefore subject to control when the governments deem it necessary "in the interest of national security".
Never, I will never use ripple.

I'm excited, I think it will make a big difference in the world of payments.  
I was just at the desk with a customer trying to make a $2500 payment towards a car with his debit card.  It was declined because of daily spend restrictions etc...now he's calling to try to get ahold of a bank and unlock his money.  I'll be happy when people don't have to do this and instead can freely spend their own money.

every time i've tried overclocking / manipulating settings too much, I end up getting hardware errors, crashes, freezes... it's just not worth it.  I run it like, -I20 but with stock voltages / clocks etc and it's just steady, runs 24/7 in an unheated garage with a fan on it, i'd rather have the stress free 750 than have to fuck around constantly for an inconsistent 800.

Hi, I'm curious what would you suggest I say to them?  I want to word things the best way.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:23:32
problems with ripple, just off the top of my head... it's a company... they could manipulate it for their own benefit, it's the nature of business.  Or, if a government wants control, they can just take it over.  I don't see any advantage to ripple because ripple can be manipulated by the government.  The bit thing I love about bitcoin is that there's no headquarters, no central authority.  It's perfect because there's no one to be bought out so that some ulterior motive can be accomplished.  ripple, based on my assessment, could be bought, kind of like a politician, manipulated to accomplish the goals of a few instead of being for the greater good of society.  I've had enough of central authorities fucking up currency for my lifetime.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:50:58

quick easy answer
yes you can use multiple graphics cards, I'm doing it now, guiminer is the easiest but your hashrate will be a little lower.  you'll have to use guiminer SCRYPT this is very important, reg guiminer won't make you as much money.
setup the machine running on like, multipool or hashcows or middlecoin and just mine whatever alt is most profitable.  mine alts to accumulate bitcoin
and don't worry about mining doge directly.  doge is a pump and dump that will die once the kids get sick of it/lose interest, get your shit in bitcoin and sit tight 2014 is going to send bitcoin into the real mainstream, shit's about to get real.
@_date: 2013-12-30 03:25:38
its possible if you let them
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:01:14
I'm sure that in time I could work that out, but going through all the trouble of setting up a new payment service to process smaller items that would only be paid for in bitcoin very rarely, would be hard to justify.  If I can show them that we can me a $30,000 sale of a car with bitcoin, then it'll have some traction.

huge lesson here.  I have tons of cop friends, but I am not a lawyer.  best advice i can offer.
Never volunteer anything.
When it comes to something like this here's how it goes.
Police are not your friends.  They never are.  They will never help you.  You can only end up breaking even (i.e. walking away and moving on with life) or in trouble.  Volunteering information to the police, without first consulting an attorney, will never help you.  It will never make your life better.  The police can and will lie to you without consequence.  If you're ever stopped or questioned by the police, here is the once sentence all my police friends hate:
"I have nothing to say."
That's it.  Over and over, and if you like, add - until I've consulted with an attorney.
Just that, don't let them reason with you, don't make what you think are deals, don't try to negotiate.
One sentence : "I have nothing to say"
I know this post is repetitive, but that's simply how it works.  You can never help yourself by volunteering anything, ever.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:59:09
I mean this in a nice way, ....

Serious question: Do you need a money transmitter license to do this?  Don't want to see the owner of this business get in trouble.
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:04:22
the difference here would be that bitcoin is defined by many as a currency.  Gold is by most definitions I've heard, not a currency.  This is why I'd question if you'd need a bitcoin money transmitter license, but not a gold license.  
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:14:34

watch a bunch of youtube videos about bitcoin
use 2 factor authentication on your accounts where possible, free app by google for android or apple cell phones.
use durable (complex) passwords
if something smells/feels like a scam, it probably is
don't open emails from people you don't know, no matter how good the offer sounds
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:47:36
Good news though.  We frequently receive partial payment up to $5000 on credit cards towards cars.  We limit it to $5000 because the cost is so high on the fees.  If I show my company how much they'll save vs credit cards/debit card fees then it will be a great feature.

this is why there's test markets, they could try it in a smaller city, move up to big ones like boston and NYC eventually, but maybe like a Providence RI, or a Worcester, MA etc.  It would build confidence and acceptance.

this sounds like standard AML stuff, governments don't like allowing people to move money without knowing all about it.

In the meantime, while I'm working on getting this through, if you're from the Boston area and want to buy a Toyota with bitcoin then message me and we'll set it up, I believe I can manually get this done.  I'm working on getting us setup with a bitpay account over the next couple days.

EVERYONE GO HERE
use the chat method.
This is a very good idea.  Please, everyone take a minute and contact amazon and request that they add bitcoin as a payment method. 
UPDATE: Here's my conversation with the chat rep
ChatEnd Chat
You are now connected to Summer from Amazon.com
Me:Hi, I was hoping to buy some items on amazon, but I didn't see bitcoin listed as a payment method. Is there a way to use bitcoin for purchases? If not, when will I be able to use bitcoin for purchases?
Summer:Hello, my name is Summer. I'll be happy to help you today. Let me see if we have any information on Bitcoin.
Summer:Alright. I'm not seeing any mention of it on the site. At this time it is not an option and I have no information as to whether that will be an option in the future.
I would image if Amazon does unroll that at some point there would be a pretty big press release to the public.
Me:Ok, well I hope you'll pass my request on to your boss/managers. I'm sure it would improve traffic to amazon. That's too bad for now, but I hope it's changed soon. Thanks anyway.
Summer:I know there is a lot of activity with Bitcoin. I will pass along your feedback for sure. Keep checking.
Me:THANK YOU!
If everyone does this I can't imagine they'll ignore it forever.

I mistakenly bought some zales gift cards thinking I could use them in the store.  Only AFTER you purchase them does it display that you can only use them online.  I've emailed gyft, got one response so far,  but only to say that they're consulting with management..so I'm not sure how that's going to work out.  I'm bummed because I was at the mall, ready to use them, only to buy them and find out I couldnt, and it was too close to xmas to order and get them.  I bought what I wanted with financing in the store, tried to pay the account with gift cards and was told by zales.. go fuck myself, they didn't sell me the gift cards and that wasn't their problem... so basically, fuck zales... and I'm hoping gyft helps me out :-/
