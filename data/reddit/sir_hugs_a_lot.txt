I don't know why people were complaining in 2009 about the stock market? I bought stock in 1985 and my returns were great! /s

Yeah, I don't get the point of it. Tor is only good for encrypting and protecting your communication. If the entity you're communicating with decides to take what you've "told it" and sell it to an advertiser or give it to the government it doesn't mean shit that you told it what you did in secret.

Good points.

That's quite the write-up. Seems like we're in for a ton of sell pressure and still no killer (or even very compelling) reason for the *average* consumer to want to buy and use bitcoin every day.

Respectfully, this goes against the very recent trend (6 months) of all these wallet services coming around. MasterCard, Visa, Amex, PayPal, Google, Apple and others all have these single login services to manage your various accounts. Basically, pick the one that makes the most sense for you (probably Google vs. Apple for Android vs. iPhone users) and be done with it.
Game developers won't stop allowing people to pay for their services with money. They'll perhaps offer additional options but would NEVER stop accepting credit cards and the like. Realistically, they'll integrate these wallet options which enables bitcoin via those services. So, they'll accept bitcoin but it still won't be a reason to go and buy bitcoin before buying the thing you want.
I'm now realizing that these new wallet services do far more to help credit card users than it does bitcoin users. Makes sense, too, considering the credit card companies are more than a little aware how bitcoin threatens them. Some in think they won't adapt. I'd say they've already adapted perfectly, to the detriment of bitcoin adoption.

I mean, yeah that's *possible* but not exactly a regular use case for Facebook. I can see why people doing illegal things would want that but I can't see any legit uses for that.
