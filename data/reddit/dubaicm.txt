Interesting, I didn't realise that LTC had such a large proportion. I would have put the other alts as much less too.

UAE does have problems with human rights, this is true. But to be fair, it is currently rated [the top 14th nation in the world for human rights]( It is not as oppressive as reddit tends to perceive based on a few semi-fictional tabloid news stories and that inaccurate and sensationalist video by Vice. 
UAE does still have a lot of problems to fix but it is not the misogynistic slave colony you would think from reading about it on reddit.

Why not head to the change counter and exchange 5 of your Euros to AED? Then you will have enough for coffee. You might have a little loose change left over so spend it on some water or a snack for the flight, of even just leave it as a tip. 
There is not really a need for BTC in this situation except for added convenience for a tiny minority of travellers who use them.
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:40:52


That is not the case. Perhaps you are thinking of Saudi Arabia? This is a beach party in Dubai, to give you an idea of dress codes: 
I live in Dubai and it is fairly comfortable. It is of course more conservative than the west so you will need to take that into consideration. It is also hot as balls in the summer (although very pleasant the rest of the year, it was 22C today for example) so you will need to hide inside AC buildings from June to September. 
I recommend visiting for a couple of weeks and seeing what you think. It is definitely not the scary, oppressive slave colony that reddit would have you believe!

To be fair to OP, the restaurant that accepts BTC is a Western pizza place so his options for Middle Eastern tea would be limited at that particular venue.

That must be recent because they have quite happily changed 5 Euros for me in the past. Still, change 20 Euros and get yourself a coffee and a bottle of wine in duty free or a book to read on the flight. 
If he insists on not carrying a credit card he has to accept there are going to be some minor inconveniences from time to time. Personally I don't think that BTC is particularly suited to micro-transactions anyway.

That's a strawman. The actual argument is that Bitcoin is not currently a useful currency because it is too volatile, which is a perfectly reasonable criticism. It may well become more stable in future but even the most evangelical BTC enthusiast can't deny that it is volatile.

It is dangerous to assume that BTC's price will continue to increase exponentionally, when there is no guarantee that it will and a dramatic devaluation of the currency is just as likely.

Or 6 months later that 0.25 BTC is worth $10. It may be deflationary but that are multiple other factors that affect BTC's value. You can't assume the price will increase.
@_date: 2013-05-11 12:55:36
True, I always wondered that. I understand that one of Litecoin's benefits is that transactions are confirmed much faster so maybe that will be better as a day to day currency and BTC will be more suited to internet trading and currency transfers.

**Never gamble with money you can't afford to lose.** 
I will also go further than that and say do not have *any* money in BTC that you can't afford to lose. It is too volatile and risky to be relied upon.

Sending them money is actually quite a complicated procedure, especially if you are in UK. It takes several days. Getting money out of mtgox is also not straightforward. Definitely not simple.

BTC was designed to make the developers rich too so that goes both ways. I agree that there are problems with ripple but that particular point applies to both.
@_date: 2013-05-05 07:48:17


Alternatively BTC hits $90. You buy. It then goes down to $60. You just lost $30. 
Remember that BTC is at a huge peak compared to historical levels. It has only been $100+ for the last few months. For years it was around the $5 - $8 mark, which is a more realistic long term price level.

I wouldn't say it is a scam, at least not the conventional sense of the word. The basic concept is sound but the implementation has been poor. Dodgy exchanges and negligible support in the marketplace have made it impractical to use, at least for now.

You are correct. BTC will mainly benefit large investors and those carrying out substantial money transfers. For everyone else, it is an interesting experiment but has limited use.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:15:52
OP, that sucks and I do sympathise. This just emphasises what is often repeated on this sub: do not have any amount of money in Bitcoin that you are not prepared to lose.
Bitcoin is extremely risky and highly volatile. Not only that, but the marketplace is dominated by shady operators, who cannot be trusted. Only have money in Bitcoin that you are able to tolerate disappearing. It is not to be used as a store for cash that you will need to pay bills, buy food, or purchase Christmas presents.


There is no such as thing as safe online storage when it comes to Bitcoin. Sorry you had to learn this the hard way.

@_date: 2013-04-30 06:21:20
The difference with this and everything else is that it is *disproportionately* profitable to them. This is not equivalent to investing in a start up that then generates a profit for its investors. This has been specifically designed to be massively profitable for its creators, and not to others. The creators will make profit in the millions (or even billions) of percent. If it was a few thousand percent, fair enough. Billions though? That is why people are sceptical.
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:49:19

It helps in the same way that having gold/silver/platinum helps the commodities market. A fall in one doesn't necessarily affect the others, helping to spread risk. If gold tanks, you can use silver instead.


There are small differences in the way they are implemented that means that what affects BTC would not necessarily affect the others. Besides the technical differences, there are plenty of other factors that affect the price of the alt currencies, such as politics or even just fashion.


Not necessarily. Even today (when the markets are very much in their infancy), the exchange rates for LTC, BTC, FTC, etc. do not mimic each other.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:17:09

@_date: 2013-11-04 09:35:41


Of course it isn't. I have done work for people in the past who later decide they don't want to pay the agreed amount - they would rather keep the money for themselves, despite me doing the work I was asked to do, on time, and to the required standards.

I sold 0.1087 BTC @ $142.75/BTC = $15.52 - $0.08 fee. This got converted into Euros for the SEPA payment - €0.90 fee. 
This then arrived in my UK bank account after three working days and was automatically converted into GBP. I ended up with £8.88 in the end.
@_date: 2013-05-07 19:12:07
It would not be practical for these guys. They are dealing with tiny amounts of money. The reason they needed the alternative currency is because there is a shortage of 5 rupee coins. Those are worth 9 cents.
To use BTC on the move, you need to at least have a smart phone with a data connection and I can't image someone who was worried about 9 cents owning one.
Also the transfer time for BTC simply doesn't match the 2 seconds it takes to hand over a coin. Are they really going to wait 10 - 20 minutes to pay their 9 cents for a cup of tea? BTC has its uses but this is not one.

I agree that the way Ripple is set up is less fair than BTC.


We don't know whether Satoshi is an individual or an organisation. It could be dozens of people who collectively mined thousands (millions?) of BTCs under multiple alts.

That might happen eventually but right now it hasn't and it probably won't for several years as developing an efficient ASIC for scrypt has various technological challenges to overcome.
Regardless of the technical differences, it will also be important to have a wide range of cryptocurrencies simply to provide diversity. This will protect people in the case that one fails or has some major problem such as a dramatic devaluation.

You will get about 120 MH/s out of your 680. This will generate around 0.04 BTC per week at current difficulty levels running 24/7. This converts to around $4.40 per week at current exchange rates. 
Bear in mind that you always pay for your electricity one way or another. If it is included in your rent, your landlord will need to raise the rent to cover the overhead. If your PC is plugged in at work, there will be less money for raises/bonuses, etc. Whatever the source of the power, you will pay eventually.

The price fluctuations are a major problem and it is frequently cited as one of the main issues that is preventing BTC from being adopted more widely.
People cheer when it goes up because the majority of BTC owners don't use them as currency, they treat them as an investment. When BTC goes up, they have more money in their savings.

I am making no such claim. So far no bank has offered a credible alternative to BTC so our discussion is purely hypothetical at this stage.


Personally I agree that BTC is more trustworthy. But I am considering how a typical person will react to it, one who is not technologically literate and does not have an understanding of cryptography. Will they be more inclined to trust some shady "hackers", or a big bank they know well backed by a marketing campaign?
All mainstream currencies are centralised so I am not sure what you mean when you say that centralised currencies have not been accepted. On the contrary - no decentralised currencies have been accepted and I include BTC in that because I would say that BTC is a long way off from being "accepted" by the market in a meaningful way.
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:19:00


No one knows. Not for a while IMO but then I am just making a guess. BTCs as an investment are *extremely* risky and not recommended for a first time investor. Only put in money that you can afford to lose and don't need access to in the short term.


No, unless you can find someone locally to sell them to you (i.e. peer to peer).

That's fair enough but that won't happen when it is still so hard to get hold of the things. The price dropped a few days ago so I thought "great I will buy a few bitcoins with my debit card". Nope. I entered a world of either 4 day waiting times, dodgy Russian websites, bizarre chains of transferring money from one exchange to another, or massively punitive fees (NB: I am not in USA).
They are not going to become a viable currency if the average person cannot pick up a couple of hundred BTC (with small to negligible fees) online when they feel like it. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:57:18


If they did indeed just stumble on BTC in the early days, then yes they would just be very lucky. But the creator and his cohorts would have been "in on it" and hence were in a unique position to profit.


There may be one creator but he could easily have a many accomplices.


You still can mine BTC with a gaming computer but you are not going to become a millionaire by doing it and it has been this way for at least 2 years, unlike the very early minters who could generate dozens of BTC a day.

People had concerns with their figures but the concept remains robust. Even if selfish mining was not possible, controlling the network by a single entity is straightforward. 
Right now, it is not worth it because the total value of Bitcoins is relatively small. If Bitcoins become worth around $1000 - $2000 each, it would be an obvious target for attack and this would of course be entirely legal.

We can already do that. Within UK, for example, there is the Faster Payments system that sends money to someone in a couple of hours for free and other countries have similar sytems. Paypal, for all its faults, is not much hassle either. For merchants, I can use my debit card.
Sending money to someone in BTC is actually a lot more bother than a standard bank transfer in most cases, because in order to use that money they have to convert the BTC into their local currency and that is definitely a hassle.

You are right, I should have said cryptocoins.


If another coin becomes more popular for valid reasons, I see no reason not to support it. Bitcoin is fine for now but I certainly expect it to be eclipsed by other cryptocurrencies in the future. Almost all standards and norms become outmoded eventually.

With Bitcoin, the major investors control the money. For example, [the Winklevoss twins announced they own 1% of all BTC]( This might not seem like a lot but if they decided to sell it all at once, it would have a major impact.
BTC is (at the moment) extremely vulnerable to manipulation. A regime could *easily* take control of it. Only when it is more mature in maybe 10 or 20 years time will it be a more reliable currency.

Moving traditional money around is not as hard as moving it in and out of the BTC exchanges though. Ten days is far too long. I can send traditional cash to Japan in one day using a telegraphic transfer so lord knows why it takes MtGox ten.
@_date: 2013-05-01 15:57:07
I completely agree and this is a major hindrance to having them become mainstream.
If I want Euros/Yen/etc., I can walk to the bureau de change across the street and buy as much as I want with my debit card and have them in my hand in 2 minutes. The exchange rate will be fair and I will pay a reasonable commission of around 1%. No shady meet ups, no foreign banks, no crazy fees, just a simple transaction, as easy as buying a coffee.
Until buying BTC is as easy as this, the general public will be very reluctant to adopt them.

It is an example of transferring money digitally that is not much hassle. Most importantly, I can do it in GBP.

If that is the case, it is a major impediment to bitcoin adoption. Casual users are not going to be setting up dedicated linux-based, offline machines just for their bitcoin. 
They want to use it on the laptop, desktop or tablet that they use for everything else.

True, but the early BTCs were extremely easy to mine. You could get dozens a day even just using basic CPU mining. The system is designed to make it harder and harder to mine BTC. Therefore it massively (disproportionately) benefits the creators at the expense of those who come later.

I think his use of the word "scam" is a little sensationalist ([for which he later apologises]( but he actually does have some good points. 
In particular, early adopters have benefited disproportionately. Due to the "difficulty" part of the mining algorithm, the first mining rigs were churning out dozens of BTC per day, even just using CPU mining. Someone from that time could now have millions of dollars worth of bitcoins for a tiny input of time and energy. This is hugely beneficial to the creators of the scheme, hence why Cohen might have felt inclined to use the word scam.
hugolp made the comparison to investing in Facebook at an early stage, but this is not a valid comparison. These people were investing in a company. BTC is not supposed to be an investment vehicle, it is supposed to be a currency, but the way the system is set up discourages its use as such. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 09:28:39
One of the main drivers of LTC is GPU miners. BTC has become a victim of its own success now and now BTC mining is becoming primarily the preserve of the wealthy.
LTC is still accessible to all. This means people are generating LTCs at home. Eventually they may want to spend these without going through the hassle of conversion, which will drive a LTC economy.

First you need to open an account at Bitstamp. You need to send them scanned copies of your passport and proof of address. They take a couple of weeks to process this.
You then send the money to Bitstamp's account in Slovenia using a wire transfer in US dollars. This takes about 3 days. You can do this through your bank here in Dubai, and they will charge a fee - usually around 100 dhs or so. Alternatively you can use the little exchanges that are dotted around the city (Al Rostomani, etc.). It usually costs about the same as a bank, or they won't have an explicit fee, but will use a lower exchange rate to generate the profit.
Once Bitstamp receives the money, they take a cut (about $15?) and spend some time to "verify" the amount - usually a day or two. You can then use the cash to buy Bitcoins. Bitstamp takes another cut at this point, 0.5% I think. 
Once the purchase has gone through, you can transfer the Bitcoins to your private wallet, which takes about 40 minutes. Good luck!

There are lots of options available to you, assuming you are not unique in your opinion and have a majority of people in your region who support you.
1) Use democracy and vote the leaders out.
2) If that doesn't work, campaign for greater local power (devolution).
3) If that still doesn't work, campaign/fight for independence so that your region is no longer under the authority of said leaders (secession).
4) Your final option, if all the others don't work, is to organise a revolution to overthrow the leaders.
These are the actions required if you genuinely feel that your current situation is intolerable. Small acts of civil disobedience will achieve nothing more than riling up local beaurocrats and will attract small fines for you. If you want big changes, you have to take big actions.

This seems to happen a lot and although user error is a factor, MtGox should also be introducing more security features to help reduce the frequency of such incidents and make their security more "fool proof". Even with 2 factor, it seems that people are being robbed.
For example, my online bank account requires three different stages before I can access the account, including a password, PIN, and asking me to identify an image that I previously identified with the account. If someone tries to log in from a new location, I get notified.
Of course there is no such as thing as theft-proof but it seems to me that MtGox could be doing a lot more to prevent theft.

I expect you have heard this a hundred times but, as someone from outside USA, I still find this such a strange system. In UK, for example, the waiters are paid a reasonable salary and that is covered by the price of the food. You can of course give them more if you like the service. 
I wonder why the US has evolved this odd system that relies purely on people's generosity? It is only in F&amp;B too. If you buy a TV, for example, the salesperson doesn't get a tip. Their wages come from the price of the TV. F&amp;B seems uniquely designed to stiff the staff.
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:40:49


The difference is that the early BTC were extremely easy to create *by design*. The creators designed the system so that they could create many BTCs very easily and made sure that other people coming along later would not have that advantage. 
The difference with gold is that some people may find a load of gold but they would simply be very lucky. It is naturally occuring so nobody can control where it does and doesn't occur. This at least makes it slightly more fair. With BTC, the creators controlled the supply system to benefit them.

Because it is so high risk, it is essentially gambling. There is nothing wrong with that in itself - I like a flutter as much as the next man - but, as with gambling, I assume that my money is going to go down the drain unless I am extremely lucky. Of course I don't want to lose the money, but I accept that I probably will and therefore make sure the amount is trivial enough that I don't mind.
This in contrast to investing where you would have to be pretty unlucky to see it halve overnight. It is not unheard of, of course, but the kind of volatility you get with bitcoin and the inherent unreliability are not to be found in even the most high risk stocks and shares.

Even the slow methods cost too much IMO. Certainly compared to buying traditional currency, the fees are overpriced. This is a barrier to entry for most people interested in BTC.

They could repost the content on an internal site but then they would lose that revenue from their commercial arm. 
You call it a "gravy train" but the BBC's funding is insufficient, hence why they have had to move their operations out of London up to the north of England, make hundreds of staff redundant, and also why they need to develop alternative revenue streams, such as their commercial arm.
BBC provides a unique service that is not without fault but is, in my opinion, still the best in the world. Because they receive licence payers money, it means they can afford to remain truly independent. They can also produce content that is not necessarily commercially lucrative but is, nevertheless, hugely important. Things like the BBC World Service, for example, or their fantastic investigative journalism. These do not generate a profit but society would be worse off without them. 
Even their breathtaking documentaries rarely make a profit but the great thing is that they don't need to. The UK, and also the rest of the world, benefits from this unique system of funding.
The alternative would be to allow the BBC to advertise in UK, which I believe would be a terrible decision and would compromise their independent position.

You are correct and this is a major flaw that a lot of Bitcoin enthusiasts tend just to dismiss with some hand-waving. Bitcoin could be controlled by a small number of people with relative ease, if they have a couple of billion dollars to put towards it (i.e. almost any government or large corporation).

I think it depends which city you are in and whether they have the infrastructure to accept other currencies. In London, for example, many places will accept payment in Euros instead of pounds sterling because it is economically viable for them to do so due to the legions of Euro-wielding tourists.
Here in Dubai, the currency is the UAE dirham, but most places will happily accept Saudi Riyals, Qatari Riyals, Omani Riyals, or even US dollars. They have the the facilities to handle multiple currencies.
Places will start accepting BTC if it is economically viable for them to do so. Currently, this is not the case in the vast majority of places.

I just did a google search for p2p bitcoin but I am none the wiser. How does it work and where do I do it?
@_date: 2013-05-05 17:00:19
I assume that machine is in a specialised location as most UK ATMs are free. You are paying for the convenience. This is an unusual and exceptional case.
Currently the process of obtaining and using BTCs is riddled with fees so BTC is not (yet) the answer to this conundrum.
@_date: 2013-05-22 12:00:26
You are being downvoted but you are correct. When currencies get into trouble, local people simply adopt more stable ones. For example, when the Zimbabwe dollar went into hyper-inflation ([inflation rates were 89,700,000,000,000,000,000,000%]( they used euros, pounds sterling or US dollars instead. This is a fast and efficient way to get some stability and, as you say, can happen much more quickly than trying to get everyone online.

If you don't want to deal with the exchanges to buy Bitcoin, which is understandable, your only option is to carry large quantities of cash. This leaves you substantially more vulnerable in the event of an attack.
If you were conducting any other transaction, you could just use a debit/credit card. You can't do that with Bitcoin, so it encourages people to carry cash around. That is what this has to do with Bitcoin.

Regardless of where he lives, the point still stands that the vast majority of traders don't accept BTCs.

Until you can use BTC as widely as dollars, I think it is understandable that people need to cash out occasionally.

Thanks for the info. I am in Dubai though so it would still involve the cost (and time delay) of an international wire transfer on top of your fees.

It would to a certain extent but the value of the namecoins you mine is currently around 7 or 8% of the value of the BTCs mined so it is fairly small.
Mining LTCs currently gives you about 30 - 50% better $ return than mining BTCs on the same rig, which is why a lot of GPU miners are switching to LTC mining.
@_date: 2013-05-11 14:21:34
Definitely sell them. You are in no position to be investing in a highly risky and volatile currency like BTC. 
Only invest in BTCs what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:57:09
As said, buy most of the mining power. They don't even need to buy 50%. [These researchers at Cornell University estimate you can control the network with just 33% of the hash rate.](

I have been trying to set up two factor authentication on Bitstamp with little luck.
I am using a Blackberry with OS 7. I have installed Google Authenticator. My BB is time-synched automatically. I scan the QR code given on the Bitstamp webpage under Settings &gt; Two-factor authentication &gt; Enable Two-factor authentication using my BB. Google Authenticator on my BB gives me a six digit number. I enter this Verification Code box on the website. It says "Invalid authentication code".
What am I doing wrong?

It is because it only takes a relatively small sell or buy order to cause the market to jump. 
Someone selling, say, $100k of BTC would make a significant impact to the price of BTC. The effect of someone selling $100k of gold on the gold price/oz wouldn't even be measurable.

You need many and they need to be in your region so there this is a) competition, b) diversity, and c) local supply. That doesn't exist yet.

In the interests of accuracy, you didn't actually purchase anything with BTC. You converted your BTC to dollars, which you then used to purchase goods. 
I know that sounds nit-picky (and it is). It is a subtle point, but an important one: you still had to use traditional currency to get what you wanted.

There might not be a central entity trying to take advantage of everyone but you can't deny that the creators of BTC had a *huge* advantage over everyone else when they could mint BTC at very low difficulty. The early BTC miners would generate dozens a day with basic equipment. The creators designed it so that no one else would have that advantage later on by making the difficulty increase.

@_date: 2013-05-05 17:44:42
I agree with your theory. However in practice, the average high street consumer doesn't care if a currency is decentralised or not and probably doesn't even know what that means. They want something reliable they can trust their money with, and a big name bank meets that criterion.

There are many more reasons why Bitcoin could be worth nothing. Ultimately, it is only worth what people agree it is worth. Right now, it is fashionable, which is causing a surge in buying. 
Another more user-friendly altcoin could come along. Bitcoin could become the Friendster of altcoins - initially hugely popular but now largely forgotten.

Small fees to transfer BTCs once you have them. Large fees to actually obtain the things in the first place.

It shows up on the phone bill. I will explain the process:
1. You send an SMS to 7275 containing your plate number, the code for the carpark (the code is on signs around the carpark), and the number of hours you want to stay (e.g. your SMS contains "A12345 212B 4" if your car has plate number A12345, you are in carpark 212B, and you want to park for 4 hours).
2. You get a SMS by reply confirming your purchase.
3. At the end of your time, you get another SMS letting you know it is about to expire. You can reply with Y to extend for another hour if needed.
4. The car parking fee appears itemised on your next phone bill.
You can also buy physical paper tickets from machines at each car park. When the traffic wardens are going round and you don't have a physical paper ticket on display, they scan your plate with a handheld meter and it tells them if you have paid by SMS. If you don't have a SMS ticket or a paper ticket, you get a parking fine.

I don't anticipate a flaw to be found in PKE. I am thinking more along the lines of something like [selfish mining]( or some other effect that hasn't been considered yet.

Anyone is allowed to browse &gt; And why would you comment this to the exact people that will think you're an idiot for doing so?
Some of us are here because we want to find out more about BTC. I don't think someone is an idiot for questioning it. In fact, they would be an idiot if they didn't question it. 
The fact is, the creators of BTC have made themselves *extremely* wealthy with their invention by minting 1000s of BTC when difficulty was low and required very little effort. I think it is natural to feel that there is something amiss.

What is the best way to convert small amounts of BTC into GBP? I have about 0.05 BTC that I want to convert but all the exchanges charge fees that would gobble this up.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:20:40


I have yet to find a place to convert BTC into GBP that charges a reasonable fee. Know anywhere? I am reluctant to pay anything more than 1%.
@_date: 2013-05-07 19:04:23
I used Bitstamp. I sold 0.1087 BTC @ $142.75/BTC = $15.52 - $0.08 fee. This got converted into Euros for the SEPA payment - €0.90 fee.
This then arrived in my UK bank account after three working days and was automatically converted into GBP. I ended up with £8.88 in the end.

That line describes the root of the problem. They are not going to keep repeating the same fact over and over again. The rest of the article explains why that weakness is a problem. 
This is different to a conventional 51% attack, where you control &gt; 50% of the hash rate. This describes a technique for controlling &gt; 50% of the network, even though you don't have &gt; 50% of the hash rate.

That is not the case. Anyone could view the article if it was on an internal site. Only the commercial arm is blocked for UK viewers. Non-UK viewers are not blocked from viewing any BBC articles.


OK, I got that wrong. 


As I said, they are not without flaws. However I think they are still the best broadcasting organisation in the world, despite these flaws. David Attenborough's documentaries are worth the license fee alone. I use the BBC News website daily. BBC radio is the only I find worth listening to (6 Music is my favourite). 
If they changed the way they are funded, all of these things would have to be changed fundamentally.

This is the main problem I have had too. Time delays, extortionate fees, and elaborate faffing with foreign banks. It is a major hindrance to BTC's adoption.
