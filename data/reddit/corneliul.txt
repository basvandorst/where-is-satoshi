The guy made an example... If a WHALE sells... 3500 bitcoin is a delphine. Of course it is liquidity for that sum.
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:09:44
Not even satoshi can liquidate his fortune because not enough liquidity or exchanges will block such a huge transaction or someone will kill him just for trying that. There's billions in stake now, why do you think he dissapered? Not stupid... Lol... I still wait for Craig to 'destroy' bitcoin... Haha

@_date: 2019-08-08 09:22:15
Salut române. Băga-te pe kraken sau bitpanda sau Bitstamp. Sunt cele mai bune pentru Eu. Fa un transfer SEPA și ai comisioane mici.
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:26:32
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:18:35
No credit card purchase, but the fees on cards are high anyway. Btw... Very high security methods for witdraw crypto, you need to approve through mail your public key in a email, to approve witdraw to that address. So... I used Binance, kryptopia and changelly. If you need feed back on those pm me.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:15:32
Indeed a live in a peaceful area. But if you put the problem this way you can extrapolate to fiat too, etc... And everywhere in the world. Depends how much money you have and or if ppl around think/know you have.
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:52:13
I got tier 3 in 2 days on kraken.
@_date: 2019-08-08 10:17:01
Eu as evita Crypto cardurile. Au comisioane prea mari. Eu am luat și cu Changelly, folosesc Simplex și ei. Sunt de încredere, dar dacă iei cu cardul e scump. Fă-ți un cont undeva(depinde ce vrei sa iei), baga bani prin transfer SEPA, urmărește prețul și ia când îți convine. La SEPA è ieftin, comision mic la cumpărare și retragere. Ai un ledger ceva? Nu lăsa nimic în bursa niciodată, doar dacă nu faci trading...
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:14:33
Kraken, used it a lot of times. Low fees, no. 1 security of the funds, audit on funds ok, never hacked, high liquidity, even if US based has highest liquidity for EU zone, SEPA to German bank(Fidor). Cons are... not many available assets to trade. Depends on what you choose.
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:26:57
Sei italiano?
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:58:46
Kraken usa una banca tedesca, Fidor. Se fai SEPA arriva 1-2 giorni. Commissioni piccoli. Puoi registrarti anche su BITSTAMP, americana, ma con liquidità elevata per euro, o bitpanda, austriaca. Sono  sicure e serie.
@_date: 2019-10-24 07:26:11
I use kraken for 3 years now. They work in EU wirh German bank. Most secure exchange for now... What's wrong with you?
@_date: 2019-08-31 23:24:59
Ty for the site. Didn't knew exist.
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:57:10
You just need 1 utility bill on your name. But I think that is for tier 3... Do you have all that money to trade? 100.000 euro...
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:59:52
Dipende cosa vuoi comprare. Aproposito, sono rumeno io. Se hai ancora domande chiedimi pure.
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:53:30
Just open account on kraken then. Forget coinbase. Yc for tiers are fast. Kraken is rated 1st as security...
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:08:53
Bought 5700, didn't sold at 12000.
@_date: 2019-08-16 21:17:10
Fake overmakeup lady. I don't trust her smile.
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:32:53
And SEPA is fast too, 1.5 days usually. Remember on kraken when you compile the form there's a field where you can write the reason for transfer or whatever client wants. In that field you must input your unique kraken number, so they know you did the transfer. That number you get it from kraken page, deposit EUR... After you log in of corse.
@_date: 2019-10-24 08:27:15
I see... Bitstamp can't be cracked, but kraken yes. That guy asked if it's secure, that's all... to purchase 1000. So the answer is yes. I just bought 3700, 1300 euro only last month from kraken. Witdraw to my ledger... So go ahead...
@_date: 2019-06-29 21:20:54

@_date: 2019-06-24 09:48:29
Where you from? I'm from Italy and I used both of my cards, Mastercard and Visa with coinbase and changelly. Look at your tier level, maybe you need some increase. Also  see if your card is debit or credit cards. Mine are debit.
@_date: 2019-02-19 23:42:03
I got my bitcoin symbol on Windows too. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 22:03:31
You're not the first I heard had problems with them. I wanted to subscribe for a wirex card, but little by little post like yours got my attention. There's a connection between UK and Estonia, wirex, Changelly and guarda wallet. Something is fishy. I personally decided to not use any exchange, wallet that connect to Estonia. I think if EU country they have Russian mafia money laundry through crypto space. Maybe I'm paranoic. Now I only use kraken and LEDGER. Kraken uses a German bank in EU. Sorry for your loss dude. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:56:47
Agree... Kraken the best.

@_date: 2019-06-30 00:22:25
That's the pin for it. Don't hold 24 seed with it though. If stolen recover ASAP from 24 seed your coins with another hardware or software wallets, generate and move your funds to new addresses.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:15:17
If you're terrified because you have money, imagine those who doesn't have any. Grow up, diversify your portfolio, I mean fiat, crypto, stocks, land, apartments and specialy... Work.
@_date: 2019-06-29 21:21:22
If its true of course.
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:29:38
It's easy... Sum, IBAN, name of bank...it's easy. Just compile the fields from your form your bank offers. I hope you get e-banking so you can do it online. For future SEPA to the same bank just save kraken details so it will be faster in future. They are from US, but in EU they use a German bank, Fidor.
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:55:01
The fees are high for card purchases.

I just answered the guy question. I don't use them. Actually I prefer having the real bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:53:53
I use only kraken and binance now.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:01:17
Bitstamp. Kraken for EU. You can look bitpanda too.
@_date: 2019-02-01 00:03:19
I live in Italy from 2005 and I can tell you they never recovered after 2008. So they WERE in recession and still are. 
@_date: 2019-04-27 09:28:42
Depends on specs, but not worth it. If you wanna try something tho, try monero, cpu coins or wait to became a node for something like Radix.
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:56:59
Very elegant. Congrats for your work.
@_date: 2019-04-29 16:19:29
