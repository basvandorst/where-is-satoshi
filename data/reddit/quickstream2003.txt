pretty new, cpu cost me nothing, got a 2nd dummy rig that i can put nicehash on and my 1080ti to mine if i burn the cpu out no big deal i want to learn the more finer details of mining, learning these settings will help me down the line as i get more experiance. i managed to get it running in the end i used a site similar to that one though that one did come up when researching. I do realize the cpu will never likely make me money im likely better off buying scratch cards to get profits understand im doing it for fun, likely short term while i learn about this stuff and costs me nothing at all.
i appreciate all the help and thank you for explaining that stuff there was no read me in the zip for the miner to find out that stuff.

so i have cpuminer 1.3.1-x64 how to i set it up to solo mine? 
i dont understand all these commands -a, -o, -u,-p c=?
this is what i guessed so far
cpuminer-gw64-avx2 -a sha256(i think thats the right algo) -o stratum+tcp://some-address-i-think?? -u mybitcoinaddress -p c=(no idea what goes here)
this is the default line
cpuminer-gw64-avx2 -a timetravel -o stratum+tcp://yiimp.ccminer.org:3555 -u MCchQ675kJYeXoCACgkKx6xakubE8CAQ5A -p c=MAC
