Yes, bank to bank transfers are typically ACH.  The comment I was reaponding to was about bank to bank, not wire transfers.

I don't know what banks you are using in North America, but I have a free checking account and can do bank to bank xfers without a fee.  Free external transfers are very common.

Almost 4am!

I'm in Boston, but I do a lot of work in Hong Kong, so I know that it's 12 hours ahead of EST.  (4pm here is 4am the next day there).

This goes along with China tightening its control over citizens buying property outside of China.  The wealthy in China are hiding their money from the government, and crypto-currencies are seen as another way for people to get around government control.
As China tries to tighten its grip on people, the Chinese people will find ways around them...
China is terrified of people having free will.

Wondering that myself...

Almost everywhere, but the method might be different.  Most major brokerages have DRIP, which reinvests your dividends into fractional shares of the stock.
There are also platforms like Motif where you essentially build ETFs with fractional shares.
Motif, and many platforms like FolioFirst, Loyal3, and tons of others allow you to invest a dollar amount and get fractional shares of single stocks.  I can use any of those platforms to invest $100 in AMZN.

You absolutely can!  Almost all major brokers allow you to with DRIP, and there are tons of platforms that let your purchase fractional shares of stocks.  Many of them don't even have fees.

Yes, it's very common to have DRIP for stocks.  Most of the major brokerages offer that.

Shares can be divided, and there are many platforms that allow you to purchase fractional shares of stocks, and vote your shares.
Mutual Funds and ETFs have it built in, and DRIP allows reinvestment into fractional shares.

Shareholders elect the Board, and still vote on major items (executive compensation, direction of the company, et cetera)

Someone asked why we can't buy fractional shares of stocks.  My response was:  
"Shares can be divided, and there are many platforms that allow you to purchase fractional shares of stocks, and vote your shares.
Mutual Funds and ETFs have it built in, and DRIP allows reinvestment into fractional shares."
I specifically said that certain platforms allow you to trade fractional shares, along with ETFs and DRIP.  I never said that you can go to an exchange and purchase a fraction of a stock.
The original question was asking if it was possible to buy fractional shares of stocks, and my answer is still correct: many platforms allow the purchase of fractional shares.  They didn't ask how the platforms handle that in the background.  The user who asked the question can go onto any number of platforms and invest in fractional shares whenever they feel like it.

It's actually pretty common; DRIP and stock splits can often result in fractional shares, so can reinvestments in mutual funds and ETFs.  Many large brokers like Capital One, and small brokers (Motif, Folio, Loyal3) also allow users to purchase fractional shares of stocks.  Though, it's not available on all stocks.
Buying fractional shares has become much easier as technology advances, and is increasingly popular with younger investors who would rather buy $100/month of SBUX or AMZN, than buy one share at a time.  Most of the newer investing platforms aimed at younger investors focus on dollar amounts, not shares.

Not saying that he definitely wasn't lying, but many 'sales type' people or investors got into bitcoin pretty early on as well.  They might not be able to explain exactly how it works, but they had the instinct to know that it was going to be big.

You can buy fractional shares of stocks though, so I'm not sure where the confusion is coming from...  I could buy $100 worth of Amazon right now if I wanted and get 0.1 shares of AMZN.
