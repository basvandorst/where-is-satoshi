Imagine hearing that sentence 10-15 years ago.
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:26:22




If you're going to completely forget the oppressive historical fact of governments then your point is ignored. 


Respect for consent is a rule.  And you deciding that respecting other people is too inconvenient for you makes you an asshole. It isn't an argument against respect for consent. 


Oh, I see. You think your shitty imaginary scenario is evidence. 




No human is more valid than another.  And he is clearly wrong with the quote you provided.
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:47:23




Given the fact that I never claimed the free market to be magical or without flaw, you're just bashing straw.  It must feel so satisfying to invent what other people said then "defeat" it when in reality, you're just broadcasting your own ignorance. 


Whoever the market respects and decides to reward does.  And no, coercing people does not make it consent.


It is.  It presumes that without the government, people would stop giving a shit about survival.


No I'm not.  He's wrong because markets are not bad.  They are the most efficient way to allocate finite resources. 


Calling me brainwashed because I favor individuals deciding for themselves?  I would laugh if that wasn't so pathetic.
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:56:47
I just refuted you line by line.
What else do you need to admit when you're wrong?
@_date: 2018-09-17 11:30:56


100% false.  Capitalism doesn't create pressure for people to do things.  Their own metabolisms and desire for nice stuff does.  If you could stop predicating criticism of economic systems on lies, that would be great. 


Given the fact that nearly every example of government in human existence is inherently based on violating individual consent, it is.


At least you can admit why you're wrong. 




Opinions aren't evidence.  Bad ones really aren't. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:21:31
Why is that fascinating?   Do you think the usual strawman about libertarians supporting corporate control is accurate?   We want individuals to have control over their own lives.  We have no interest in trading one master for another.
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:20:18
That idea would be a vast improvement. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:38:14
 Lip service isn't action.  How they act in power is what's telling. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:39:27
 You are profoundly ignorant
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:12:39


Just so we're clear, you think a company that lives or dies by reputation is going to target their customer base?   That's a preposterous concern. 


That's a dumb argument. You're suggesting that a failure to imagine a better solution as a defense of the status quo is sane.


Oh, it's the "corporations are moustache-twirling villains" argument.  How pedestrian.


I didn't say that at all. Your arguments are garbage.  The choice to take your business elsewhere is the check on companies.  The lack of choice with government is the problem you seem to be railing against but you're too oblivious to realize it.
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:44:58


You would have either of those in a free market. 


Raise your standards. 


Just going to rewrite history to bolster your argument, huh?  Fighting back against government is how our predecessors achieved tnt level of freedom they had. It has massively eroded since then and for some groups, has never been achieved. 


I like the part how you give credit to the government for markets existing despite its parasitic presence. 


On the contrary, I'm dolly aware of what I advocate. 


Nope, government monopolies have this world strangled across every corner of the globe. 


Government is a monopoly. You are wrong. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:09:25
I did though. Your foolishness was not a valid refutation. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:54:12
You misunderstand. I'm very good looking. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:05:30
What kind of asshole thinks respect for consent is toxic? Get the fuck outta here, you sociopath. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:23:04
The caricature you're criticizing sounds terrible.  Get a sense of humor, chump. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:54:01


You seem to confuse my advocacy for choice with blind defense of companies. The problem with government is that it removes choice. A company acting like a government is no better than the government itself. 


I think they are very successful at fooling people into believing they don't do that. 


I'm not opposed to rules.   I'm opposed to rulers.  The difference is consent. 


That's not how market competition works.


You're describing government, not markets. Markets are a race to the top in terms of innovation and pricing that benefits consumers, the exact opposite of what you're describing. 


Not even close. What you're describing is not what I'm calling for. You're just bashing a strawman. 


 You're naive to think you have freedom now. You just like your comfortable prison. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:36:03
I've been silly to engage you. Your mentality is wholly incapable of rational thought. In no way have you responded intelligently to my original comment.  So you are correct that my disdain for you has been present in the last couple comments.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:06:24


Attacking your customers reduces your profit. 


Again, you ignore the reputation issue.  It's the same mentality of dating someone who cheated on their partner to be with you. 


Lol no. It would signal that they hired a criminal and they will fire them to have a company they can trust.  You don't understand how businesses work. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:03:45
Hahaha holy shit no. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:20:06
And Keynesian economics would be valid if individual consent didn't matter.  You can identify who thinks that way based on who supports it. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:02:06
 Republicanism is laughably not against big government. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:46:05
I tire of your naive view of the world.  Just because you're oblivious doesn't mean other people are wrong when they say things that go against your silly imagination. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:04:25
 Your disregard for facts is the joke.
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:42:17
You just can't help embarrassing yourself 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:23:06
Oh bother. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:57:23


That is a personal incredulity fallacy.  I am fully capable of reaching a mutually beneficial and consensual arrangement with a company offering security service subscription. 


Companies don't have power without pleasing their customers. Government operates regardless of subject satisfaction or consent. I'll take the voluntary transaction over the theft and coercion, thanks. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:26:09
Lol, fuck off statist
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:31:39
No I didn't, asshole. I was calling you out for your terrible unwelcoming attitude. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:24:18
Why do you feel such malice towards people who want your consent to be respected?
@_date: 2018-03-03 14:36:56
God forbid newcomers look here to learn more about crypto
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:24:25
You have every reason to be proud, keep up the great work!
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:19:40
What a shitty, arrogant response
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:40:26
God forbid a sizeable market demand pays for things voluntary. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:26:04
What's the point of being completely full of shit? 
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:19:26
Who said anything about utopia?  Congrats on combining a strawman and personal incredulity fallacy in a single comment. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:08:41
 My gun in my night stand. 
Thanks for disproving your own argument. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:04:24
You don't get to dictate what others need. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:46:09
 Government is a corporation

Anarchy does not mean what you think it means. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:24:48
Wake up.
 No it isn't. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:15:59
What a foolish notion.  You completely disregard market demand for standards. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:47:47
If I weren't constantly robbed by the government, then I'd happy subscribe to a private sector defense service. 
Any other pointless questions trying to justify theft and coercion? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:14:32
Right, I don't care if you want to subscribe to a shitty government. Go nuts. 
Just don't force your bullshit on anyone else. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:07:27


The government produces nothing. It only confiscates and spends.  So thank you for making my point for me.




Nope. 


Government didn't invent time, you moron. 


No out fucking doesn't.  Government doesn't create the notion of safety.


Your convoluted circular reasoning fallacy is really stupid. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:15:05
 The real world isn't a free market either.  The failures of government are your argument for government. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:27:23
I don't understand why anyone likes the government
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:06:01
That foregone conclusion argument is a lie. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:18:57
Don’t be a sociopath. Laughing at subjugation of others is fucked up.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:07:28
 Wrong again.  Government imposes itself upon us.   My reaction or inaction is not consent. 
Do you think having sex with a passed out person because they didn't tell you no isn't rape?   Because that's the logic of your argument. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:18:40
Of course you think sensible logic is fantasy.  You're a fucking moron. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:00:47
 If you can't see how stupid that argument is then you can't be reasoned with. 
Why the fuck would a business want to have a reputation for selling death eggs?  Why is your imagination so limited that you can't fathom industry standards existing? (hint: they do) 
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:05:29
No it doesn't. It violates their property. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:20:44
 No, it is completely relevant. 
Government is shit because it is nonconsensual. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:04:06
Your slave mentality opinion is summarily ridiculed 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:07:34
I guess you also think there's no difference between voluntary transactions and forceful confiscation. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:33:29
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:01:23
Then they lose all their subscribers when their reputation is destroyed.  Seriously, give this even a moment of thought.
