Use old technology before considering new technology.  Reminds me of the Bitcoin regulations, only problem is these days they just don't warn us, they regulate to "protect" us.

Not necessarily.  They have a lot of Bitcoins left to be auctioned, why give away your bid strategy if you are going to be involved in future auctions?

Anyone not using 2FA would be crazy... Even without 2FA though, Coinbase requires new computers be verified by the e-mail account they were set up on, and they have a max daily with drawl limit set by default I believe.  With the vault, an additional 2 days would be added to processing time in the future, and requires two e-mail cosigners at least.
Coinbase gives quite a bit of user security, its up to the user though to give themselves the full security offered.

They'll post it on their site 
Its not up yet, but they've done this in the past.  Highly recommend watching them, its very good.

For the most part, yes.  
This assumes difficulty continues to increase.  Mining is a no-profit to very little profit game for the normal person.  They have to wait for hardware to be released they can use, and that hardware is priced so that the margins of profit are usually non-existent to very small.
Even if the rate of Bitcoin were to quadruple and you could make a decent profit off the mining equipment, your gains would be larger having just bought Bitcoin itself and held.
The way I'd propose it is this, if you knew that by mining you could make just a small profit (in USD), would you spend the time understanding mining, managing your servers because complications might arrise, etc... or would you just be better buying Bitcoin in advance, and using your free time and energy on other pursuits to earn money?
In the end Bitcoin mining is exciting, and interesting, but not profitable for the average person today.  Similar to mining for gold historically speaking.  Those who sold picks, tents, etc were often more successful then those who mined for gold.

Agreed. They were just given a vote of confidence.  Only time will tell if there reporting will be accurate long term though.

Glad to see he is milking the auction for what its worth in free press.  Every interview is helpful in gaining new interest and adopters for Bitcoin, so this is a good thing.

I think we are on the same page, just saying things slightly differently.  When I said physical, I was also thinking digital goods.  In the end, those really are not a currency, Bitcoin is.  Now we can split hairs about how anything can be a currency, etc... but I mean general acceptance.


Don't agree with this part.  A bank account is giving your money to someone else and trusting them basically not to screw up.  Plenty of people still hide cash in matresses, etc... but thats not really a bank.  I see bank accounts more as trusted third part holders.  Since a wallet can be created and held by anyone, how they handle it could be as bad as money in a mattress or worse. 
Now one could argue the wallet is infact the bank account.  I think there are plenty of good points to be made there as well, I'm just speaking in terms of the way I see it, and the way I think Bitcoin will grow out in the long term.


I totally get that, sorry if my comments came as too harsh, not my intent.
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:01:12
Two things could be happening here..
1) Legit, you get paid next to nothing to watch something that pays them a little more.  If thats the case, its not worth it.
2) Scam.  You sign up with an e-mail and password, and guess what, a couple users stupidly sign up with the same e-mail address assigned to their wallet account and use the same password as well.
Either way, I'd recommend staying clear of this.

Sweden is known for having less financial regulations, thus its a large reason why there is more invested in their banks from overseas.
The joke being made is who is going to be the Sweden of Bitcoin, and the fact is, Sweden is already positioning itself to be a leader in this investment area as well.
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:25:16


Love what they've been doing but I don't think there should be "one" alternative.  A centralized institution becomes political and eventually loses its best people.  This is exactly whats happening to the BitCoin Foundation.
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:26:33
I found it to be incredibly easy when I first started learning Bitcoin.  Having to verify accounts is a pretty normal function when dealing with transferring money.  I think the problem here is you are comparing it to buying physical goods.
Think about it more in terms of signing up for a credit card, a new bank account etc...  These things take time, because whatever service you use requires a level of trust in the customer and those doing transactions with the customer. 
The same applies to Bitcoin and Banking systems starting up through it like Coinbase.  The difference is, unlike a credit card company that will often mail you a verification letter that takes days/weeks to receive, or a banking system that takes days to verify a pending transaction, Bitcoin can verify a transaction in a 10 minute block based on priority.
Simplification of how consumers get Bitcoin to get started will continue piece by piece.  The more of us who have it, the more likely someone's first piece of Bitcoin will not come from exchanging USD or another currency, but simply trading a service or physical good for Bitcoin.  That transfer will happen very quickly, and unlike a bank, it won't remain pending for days.
Other actions that will occur, such as promotions by Bitcoin banks to gain customers, will entice consumers to go through a bit of work to sign up.  Think of the way Banks have offered free toasters and other promotions to gain users.  Coinbase has already done some of this to great success.
Finally, some will go through the hassle for an investment and to get the currency for other reasons (such as to spend or receive Bitcoin).  We after all go through the hassle of getting a bank account and credit card today for the same purpose.
So its all coming, its just takes time.

You fail to mention he had a long track record of telling people not to do business with Mt.Gox because of bad business practices and a lack of transparency.

Not sure why we are criticizing them for no fee.  This is great.  Its a very clear example to those watching this auction in the news to how low a Bitcoin transfer rate can be and how it is significantly different from fiat transactions today using Debit/Credit.
They are successfully transferring about 18-19M worth of Bitcoins for a $0 fee.
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:53:53
Don't disagree was just explaining how inflation can be offset by adoption  as the value of a Bitcoin is worth what the market is willing to pay.
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:38:56
Bank involvement is happening but low still.  Auction price was factored in mostly by the time the auction occurred.  Similar to stocks and earnings, and we have no guaranteed price confirmation.  Neweggs would have been a speculative price driver since it doesn't change the 9B economy by much, and it came on the same day as more important news.
It will start to go up again over time.  Right now, a lot of the things you mentioned are US news.  Worldwide adoption will likely be faster and more effective at increasing the price of Bitcoin.  As Draper mentioned yesterday, the US already does most of its transactions digitally/credit in some form, so the reason Bitcoin took off early here has more to do with the fact we are early innovators, than the fact we needed it as badly as other countries.
If you are long on Bitcoin and not focusing on day to day price fluctuations, you'll be rewarded as it gets adopted.  Otherwise, expecting one piece of news to be the catalyst is day trading.

That points to gov address, this points to winning address and with a news worthy public note.
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:25:51
A couple items.  One, many are not saying they are not interested in the currency, but are simply saying the currency is one of many things that could be impacted.  So in that sense, simply focusing on the currency would be a mistake.  Similar to thinking the internet was just for e-mail, when the Internet is important for a variety of factors.
Two, they are doing their best to say they are bullish on Bitcoin without telling low-information watchers to invest their savings in Bitcoin.  That would be a huge mistake as nothing is absolutely certain, and Bitcoin today requires a certain level of education to have a degree of safety most would be comfortable with.
Now some may feel the other way, that Bitcoin is valuable but not as a currency, but I think there are a wider degree of opinions being expressed than just that... its just that your seeing things broken down in to short answers for print and TV.
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:23:11
Feels like a bad investment.  I don't say this to be rude, but a 19% APR is crazy high, and the risk of the loss of investment with Bitcoin possibly growing is a big downside.
Why not create a pool were investors can invest in a fund of loans chosen by BTCJammer with a guaranteed return of investment?  If you were doing 19% APR, many would be willing to give you most of those returns for a guaranteed 5% APR return on their Bitcoin, if it were credible.
Again don't mean to be rude, although I realize my skepticism comes off that way.  I'd be interested in seeing what users on this site have had success with BTCJam and what changes you have in the pipeline (if any) to provide a more guaranteed APR.
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:09:56
Here's one, setting up a bank account and having money you earn at a job transfer to it.
Whaaaaaat?  That's right, first you have to sign up and give the bank a lot of details.  Then you have to give your work a bunch of details.  They then can send money to your brand new bank account, but wait, its pending because it takes days to transfer!
Now compare that to Coinbase.  You have to sign up for an account with a lot of details (like a bank, because coinbase is a bank).  Then you have to transfer funds (like an employer) and it takes days to transfer!
Wow, the audacity.  Its all Coinbase and Bitcoins fault right?  Nope, its the banking system that is slowing everything down.  
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:05:30

Bitcoin is not just inflationary, its actually hyper-inflation.  Inflation will occur for quite a while.  The big difference is the inflation amount is known, FIAT inflation can change over time.  In addition, if the adoption rate of Bitcoin is faster than the inflationary rate, the value of a Bitcoin will still go up.  This is where people are optimistic right now.
Eventually, long term, Bitcoin will no longer be inflationary.  Also, if you just look at coins burned accidentally, coins held, etc... the actual number of coins available on the market at a given point may become deflationary much faster over the next several years....
Yes though, you are correct, at the moment Bitcoin is inflationary.
@_date: 2014-07-25 15:08:12
Could still be a scam...
One thing to keep in mind, breaching a login on Coinbase or any other service is not too difficult if its just e-mail/password.  If you had stolen data from anywhere else where a security issue happened with e-mail/password its just a matter of testing logins on a Bitcoin service to see who has an account, and is using the same e-mail/password.
That still doesn't give them access though if the e-mail accounts password is not the same, or if the user has 2FA enabled on either.  Coinbase's security measures particularly help prevent theft even in the case of a hack, as I mentioned below.  Xapo is given a lot of crap for using a pin login to start, but it actually can be safer than an e-mail/password because most users use the same info between accounts every time, and few services use a pin.
In the end though, its all up to the user to use proper security.  Coinbase makes it very easy, and so do other companies (not just Bitcoin related, but e-mail related).  Over time users will learn and start adopting 2FA and other security measures more widely.
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:19:08
To summarize, Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn cofounder, investor in Xapo) was asked what the next big things would be, and he said on his own that over the last 6-12 months he's become very interested in Bitcoin.
He mentioned that while he does own some Bitcoin (no reveal on how much), he would not recommend people to buy Bitcoin today as an investment, unless they were willing to lose the money (risk for reward).  He said he's not certain on the currency as much, but the transaction chain will be a huge deal and people could use a Bitcoin or even a smaller piece like a Satoshi, to reference physical items like a car, loan, etc..
All in all, very similar to what we've heard from other industry leaders, and Reid Hoffman certainly has had a track record of predicting the next big waves.

I wouldn't invest.  Ether is used to pay for work done in Ethereum.  Most early projects using it will have pre-purchased Ether like holders for investment purposes have.
That likely means when it's mined and miners start selling... There will be more people selling than interested buyers.  The price will go down and that will panic some and they'll sell and the price will go down more.
This is not a critic of Ethereum, just a critic of it as an early investment.  In addition to that risk, you'll have your Bitcoins invested no longer in Bitcoin the entire time it is still being completed to launch.
Better to wait and invest in it after launch if it is still a viable option then.

This seems bigger to me than the NewEgg announcement.  1-800-Flowers is not geek. Its not techie.  These type of companies adopting Bitcoin and showing success will give other large companies the cover to take the plunge into accepting Bitcoin.

Not that I'm aware of, I just wanted to make it clear I was not knocking the work they were doing. Frankly, I think what they are doing is good enough.  There should be a historical document of the growth of Bitcoin.

I'm interested in others opinions on Bitcoin not as a investment commodity discussed in the video.  I see a lot of arguments for why Bitcoin is a good investment. Is there anyone out there willing to make an argument to why Bitcoin is a bad investment, even if the currency itself takes off, as mentioned in this video briefly but never detailed.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:36:51
Headline is misleading, they did not think you were serious and said so in their e-mail.  However, they are doing their best to protect themselves from stricter regulation or very bad publicity, especially if someone did end up being serious.
You have freedom of speech, but there is also a consequence to your speech.  In this case a private enterprise chose not to do business with you over your joke and it is their right.  I support them in this.  I think you'll find most serious and large Bitcoin banking systems will not take that joke very kindly as well.

I think he does a wonderful job here of explaining the problems and why it would be awful to pass these regulations as is.  I hope to see similar statements soon from all the major Bitcoin firms.  If we start hearing, "block NY", then it will be clear the regulations do have a negative economic and jobs impact, which is against NY law.
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:14:25
I'd say its largely related to NY regulation review, Ecuador ban, etc...
Not really positive news at the moment.  I think most of us here though recognized things like this would come, and you have to keep an eye out on the long term picture which looks pretty healthy.  Most Bitcoin indicators are up, with exception of volume.
