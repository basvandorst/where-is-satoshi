Coinbase is being punched very hard by community nowadays and they've deserved it.

Thanks. This is probably what I need in the first step. I'll check it out now.

My aim is not to promote or compare another coin here but I need to say that it's working. Please put aside idealism for a while and think from the viewpoint of a site owner, an author on the site or an user.

I use BTC for buying fiat :) 
Joking aside, I use BTC for buying mostly digital stuff like VPS, domains, direct payments to someone in return of a digital asset etc.
Besides that I sell websites, applications and my programming skills for BTC. 
I (and many people) prefer BTC over fiat.

Nice response to hijackers. Bitfinex also did the same.

Yes, this is exactly what is actually happening.

It's dependent on used words but probaby not enough. Currently "English Latin Charset" is the only charset that supplies the letters a mnemonic seed needs and it contains only 2 tiles per each character. So one set is not enough. You can generate a seed and count the chars and see how many tiles per character you need. If you need more than 2 tiles per character, you need two or more sets.
We'll release Mnemonic Charset soon, optimized for mnemonic seeds. It may be better for you to wait it's release.

So who buys bitcoins from those *surplus* sellers? Every seller must sell it to a buyer, right?
@_date: 2018-11-10 17:40:35
We will. We're processing payments via our node instead of using a 3rd party service. So development takes time. Since the prices not so low, we think it's ok for now to go with on-chain. Thanks for suggestions.

We think people may want to store more than one private key or seed. Actually people will need to safely store *sensitive data* in general manner in the near future, because the world is going into a cryptographic era. 
So we aimed to provide maximum storage capacity while keeping the prices nearly equal with similar products. We've optimized tile sizes and blank spaces of the plate and the conclusion was A6 sized base unit with 170-char capacity.
