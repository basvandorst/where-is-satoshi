Far be it for me to question the veracity of your story, but I have known plenty of live music venues that booked only original bands specifically to avoid paying BMI and ASCAP fees.  In this case, if that happened that club would have had an easy case against an overzealous, greedy or corrupt rep (which is indicative of an individual overstepping their authority).  The 'broken' system that you are referring to is performance royalties, the outrageous idea that if a venue is going to be making money from someone's music through a DJ, jukebox or cover bands then the artist should get some of that money.  How is that broken?

As someone who works with musicians I would love to hear the rationale behind that thought.

Let's be honest here, piracy exists solely because it is easy and relatively consequence free.  The justifications for piracy were tacked on as an afterthought.  Also, musicians have a funny way of deciding on their own what they do and do not give a shit about.  Home recording has been a boon for independent music, no doubt, but plenty of artists still benefit from utilizing a studio.

Storage and transmission of content is cheap, creation of content isn't always so.  And those things you mentioned such as streaming are done by the artist as their choice.  The artist is the one deciding how they are disseminating their content.  Piracy robs the artist of that choice, regardless of whether it robs them of any revenue or not.  If the goal is truly to help artists 'thrive' then their choices and desires should be respected.

OK, so two for Bitpay.  Is there a feature or third party vendor that allows me to set up an affiliate program and pay affiliates in Bitcoin?

Thanks for the links, checking each one as I see them, but I guess my question was more along the lines of: what are the promotional or exposure benefits for an artist to accept Bitcoin (if any)?  I can see the benefit for an artist with a sizable existing fanbase adding an alternate revenue stream, but can adding Bitcoin as a payment/tipping option potentially expose an artist to a new audience, new potential listeners?

Thank you for that, some interesting information.  Generally, the independent artists I deal with are unsigned and mainly perform in their local area.  I scout them for placement on digital compilations that are sold online.  This puts me in contact with a lot of musicians (the last time I put the call out I received over 7000 submissions).  With that kind of access to artists, I have started looking at other opportunities for them.  I set up a bundle sale for some artists on Groupees and am currently working on getting artists onto Twitch.
Bitcoin sounds like a potential opportunity for these artists.  Possibly setting up bundles of music that can be purchased with bitcoin, and I like the tip ideas you suggested.  I just have to think of the best way to present it to artists and also how to utilize the collective strength of getting a bunch of artists together.  Thank you for the reply and info.

I work with independent bands, in your opinion what are some things about Bitcoin that might be relevant to the indie music industry?  Would accepting Bitcoins for song purchases provide any kind of promotional benefit?
