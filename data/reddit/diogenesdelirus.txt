A premium account is very expensive at £7 per month. As for the standard account, there's a €30 delivery fee, and then it gets complicated:
"ATM Withdrawals up to £200 / €200 / 200USD / 200CHF / 800PLN / 1,500DKK / 2,000SEK / 2,000NOK / 800RON / 4,500CZK or currency equivalent per month are free. Anything over the above limits is charged at 2% of value of ATM Withdrawal."
I could probably make that work if charges for in-store purchases are free or super cheap, but that's not made clear. The pricing info is quite messy and difficult to interpret, which is worrying to me. It may be a good deal and a good company, but it's difficult to trust a company that obfuscate pricing info.
Or maybe I just didn't find the right info page?

That seems to be the way to go... when you can.

According to their FAQ: *"The Wirex Visa card is currently available to all EEA users. Our cards are coming soon to North America and the Asia / Pacific region."*
EEA includes Iceland.

Thank you for the useful tip!
Daily ATM withdrawal limit is €250, with a withdrawal fee of €2.25, which means I pay a minimum of 0.9% for cash. Pretty good. Outside of Europe it would be more, but still good.
Wirex -vs- Icelandic debit card -vs- Icelandic credit card
0.9% -vs- 2% -vs- 2.75% ATM withdrawal fee
0% -vs- 1% -vs- 0% In-store card purchase fee
€14.4 -vs- €7.8 -vs- €39 annual fee
Depositing money into the Wirex account is a concern though. Although Wirex says it's free, maybe my traditional bank will obscurely charge me. Do you have any experience on this?
