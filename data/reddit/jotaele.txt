I’m honestly interested in understanding why you think xrp is worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:56:12
Which link exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:41:48
Entropy. Unless you fully trust all your brothers then you are bringing more risk than you had before.

No, Im serious. I do know why I should not trust some exchanges but I remember when I first started reading about Bitcoin I did not really understand why everyone was worried about that. 
I think for someone starting to read about Bitcoin the exchange risk is something that should be explained very clearly to avoid mistakes.

Not just the volume limits, there has to be buyers for 28MM worth of bitcoin. Remember that when you sell it means someone has bought what you were selling.

I do not agree with the "if the feds wanted they could dump It an create a panic sell". You cant dump nowadays 28MM in btc as fast as to create the value sink.

It would be great to know what "bottom" equals to :)

Can still flow as in two MTGox users can still buy and sell bitcoins berween them inside the exchange?
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:00:04
The thing that intrigues me the most is how can you mess this up. You are making tons of money on fees, you have tons of bitcoins from the early days...
If the thing is they are insolvent, I don't understand how could they get to that point.

Some people locked in MtGox think that having your money in fiat is better than having bitcoins in case everything ends up on bankruptcy and they have to sue. It would be "easier" to sue for the $ amount than the bitcoin amount.

I still don't understand the "At some stage 7000 bitocins need to be bought to close those positions" and why because of that the op is "buying to squeeze these positions".
Couple more questions:
* How do I borrow bitcoins?
* How do I lend my bitcoins?
* Since I am borrowing, I guess that I would have to pay interests, at which rate?
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:39:47
Can you elaborate please? Noob here. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:20:27
What happens If the borrower can't pay me back? Since Bitcoin is a not regulated market, there is no contract signing for my lending.

If the price of a bitcoin in an exchange is set bu the buy and sells prices in that exchange how can the MTGox value change if there is currently no activity there?
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:54:23
Guys, take a look of the comment there is on the source code of MtGox blank page right now.

Can someone do an ELI5 on this? I don't undertand the short concept.
@_date: 2014-02-15 22:32:15
Good point. Appreciate the constructive conversation. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:33:13
So one wallet to store and multiple for transactions would do It right?
@_date: 2014-01-30 11:27:47


Regarding this sentence and coming from someone who just started reading about bitcoin and know nothing compared to you guys.
I've read It is not that easy to cash big sums of money, that It would take a lot of time and It is really a big concern for people like you that bought in the early beginnings.
Are you confident you would be able to cash $100k or $500k any given day without a problem?
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:39:11
Why wouldn't I trust my exchange?
