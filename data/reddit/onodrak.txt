IIRC there was a post that routing will be THE issue, from a mathematical analysis of probably and path length.

Are you using it as a currency, or as a wealth storage?
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:32:06
Not if you look at volume and understand what it means.

I don't think a cryptoligical arms race is the right basis for coin security...

An algorithm designed for CPUs and not ASIC is not really possible...  In the past the only reason for something to be stuck on a CPU task is RAM limits and lack of ASIC chips.  CPU mining can be easily offset to GPU mining with modern cards having 8gb+ VRAM.  
Then from there it is only a matter of time before a proper ASIC chip gets made and they pair it up with the required RAM value.

If you are stressing about $200, you need to GTFO of market trading.

Classic sign of a ponzie scheme, even though this is not quite the same.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:50:05
Its not really a classic ponzie, where a single entity is recycling investments to keep the scheme going, but the logistical flow is similar.
The Crypto wave we are seeing is all about the early investor option.  It is more or less a distributed ponzie scheme where, other than miners, everyone is 'buying into' the scheme using the investment of the early investors as their profit realization.  (Ie, price is high because holding, and non-mined coins are released by holders slow tricking them out, essentially the same scam the diamond industry runs)
At this point there are far too many flaws in crypto coin infrastructure for anyone to think they will become a new standardized currency.

It is non-trivial to note that said country is one of the money laundering capitals of the world.

Yea, just another shit shill wanting his payout it seems like.
If I were listening to someone talk about 'COIN A' being the bomb, and they had a quick aside to mention 'COIN B is a SCAM'.  My mind would settle on them both being scams.

Don't worry everyone, this guy solved the double spend issue.

You see the big green bar under the price jump?  That is someone/manyones buying a large volume of bitcoin.
Since stuff like this is based on market/commodity style orders, people buy or sell to these orders.  In this case, when someone buys a large number at once, the price will rise because they are buying up the orders at are offering to sell at that price.  These buys usually have a target price, and are usually done because of speculation (in a normal commodity, they might be done for actual production demand, but this is a fictional currency with 0 actual production demand).
In short, someone bought a bunch because they want to make money.
After such large buys, the price usually falls slightly, as people sell off at the new price.
There are 8 such buy-spikes in this graph, showing how much manipulation there is in bitcoin.
As bitcoin supply becomes constrained, such buyins multiply their value the earlier they were bought in.  Classic example of why bitcoin is a shit currency for real use; it promotes stockpiling and artificial price inflation (sounds like diamonds right?).

What a stupid chart...
