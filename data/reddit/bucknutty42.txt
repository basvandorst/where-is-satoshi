Move them back to GDAX and send again. If you send from Coinbase you’ll end up paying the network fee.

No, the currency itself doesn't halve. Just the reward the miners get for solving a block. 
So if you had 10 BTC when the reward halves, you're still going to have 10 BTC after. 
It's to prevent inflation. When the miners solve a block they are getting brand new BTC as a reward. That's the only way new BTC is created. So in order to slow down reaching the 21,000,000 end amount, the reward halves at times. 
Again, this is my understanding. Hopefully someone else comes and confirms/corrects.

Yep, I agree. I was trying the software out and didn't like it, which is why I wanted to cash out. 
I just wanted to post so people who aren't gamblers don't lose any money thinking they can just deposit and withdrawal.

On betonline I got this message when I deposited with bitcoin and tried to withdrawal bitcoin a few month ago. 
Thank you for your PayOut request and congratulations on your winnings. Please be informed that it has been cancelled due to Poker rake not met. Our Poker Team did inform us that there is a Rollover rule you must comply with before cashing out in the Poker side. You have played $34.52 out of the $51.00 required. Players are required to use the funds they have deposited at least one time prior to cashing out. This can be found in our web page 
This was all on the poker side. Maybe it works differently on the casino side.

It's not really screwy. It's just a double axis graph. 
Not saying it doesn't look weird, but I don't think the scales are screwy. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 13:23:52
I'm fairly new to this but I think it refers to mining. Right now the reward for solving a block is 12.5 BTC. in 2020 it's supposed to have to 6.25 BTC. 
Take that with a grain of salt though. Hopefully someone with a little more knowledge can come and confirm or correct me.

Buying x amount at fixed intervals regardless of the price. That way you average out your purchases over the long run rather than all at once. In theory you average out the price you're buying at.

They reimburse you $20 as well for the wire. Hopefully that's enough to cover the fee at your bank. My one bank is $20 so it's a wash for me.

You only have to do the wire once. After you do the wire and they've verified it's your bank account you can do ACHs.
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:56:04
I get what you're saying now. The way they did it makes it more complex than it needs to be.
It takes way more time to get a grip on the graph than it should. The linked graph you have would have definitely been the cleaner way to do it. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:32:10
That's nothing compared to the first bitcoin transaction for pizza. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:06:30
It's pretty simple. If you think the price is going to go down, sell. If you think the price is going to go up, buy. 
No one knows 100% what the price is going to do so I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for here. You gotta make your own decision and live with it. If you're not comfortable with your current exposure to the market, then sell enough to where you're comfortable. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:16:23
If you're in USA, then yes it is.

I wouldn't mess around with a VPN. If I was in Canada I'd be playing on Pokerstars, 888, or party. However, if you're set on playing where bitcoin is accepted I believe bodog.eu is the Canadian version of ignition. Americas cardroom also accepts bitcoin deposits (and I believe Canadians) but it's not anonymous like bovada, so I prefer their site. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:37:28
If you want to fuck around with moving crypto around without paying taxes then go for it. But don't come around here telling other people they don't have to pay taxes because they might not know any better and get in trouble. Tell them the truth and let them decide if they want to report there information to the IRS.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:59:15
You don't need to profit dollars. If you bought a bitcoin for $100 and you trade that bitcoin for a $2000 car then you owe $1900 in taxes. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:50:06
Yes 
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:19:55
2900/3500 is 80%. So they'd get 80% back not 40% though
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:38:03
Hahaha, me neither
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:54:24
That'd be $4k though. Maybe if the $2900 is American and the $4k is Canadian?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:04:06
You are wrong. A long term hold means you hold on to the same position for a year. So if you buy 5 bitcoin today and sell them tomorrow, it's a short term gain. You don't get to do unlimited buys and sells and then say, well I've held it a year. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:29:47
I kind of get that and I guess I'm looking at the wrong type of investment since I have to buy an external hard drive (is that what trezor is) to do it.
I'm not trying to be difficult or anything. I'm still pretty new to the bitcoin scene even though I've had minor transactions with it.
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:19:09
I apologize for choosing you, but your it. I've used bitcoin minimally and what I can't wrap my head around keeping it secure. If it was something I could open a brokerage account and buy at a bank I'd do it. I'm thinking thousands of dollars. That's what scares me. But buying a trezor or something to keep it secure scares me. Maybe that's part of what's pumping it up, but I have no idea.
(Didn't meant to pick on you but you seem to be pretty bitcoin friendly).
So what's the key to keeping your coins safe? I'm familiar with the recent hack and mt gox. I get nervous about that.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:24:30
It's unreal how many people don't understand FDIC is for fiat only. 
Yes coinbase claims to have insurance for the coins and hopefully they never use it. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:10:16
I figured. I just wanted to point it out because I thought it was a click-baity title. I think people just see the $60 and don’t look into it, when IMO I don’t think it’s that crazy of a fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:34:06
True, but I think we’re still waiting to hear the official IRS rulings. Some gold to gold exchanges don’t qualify as in kind so I’d think that bitcoin and another crypto wouldn’t either. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:07:19
“No Monthly maintenance fee for each statement cycle that you:
Maintain a minimum daily balance of at least $300/$500”
I get that you’re making a joke about the $600k and maybe I’m out of touch but I certainly don’t think having $300/$500 is asking a lot for a savings account. If you don’t have $300/$500 then you should have a checking account and those fees are waived as long as you have $250 in direct deposit, which shouldn’t be too tough for most people. 
I get that people here like to hate on the banks but it costs money to maintain accounts. Once the block rewards are all done no one expects the miners to mine for free. They’ll still collect transaction fees, so why is there an expectation that banks should do things for free?
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:50:00
You realize the gain when you go crypto to crypto in the US. Not sure if you’re talking about someplace else. 
For example, you buy $100 worth of BTC. It’s now worth $1000. You use that to buy $1000 worth of ETH. You just took your initial $100 and bought $1000 of something else. You’re gain is now $900. 
Personally, I wouldn’t be reporting my example to the IRS since it’s such a small amount, but it’s a realized gain.

Once the republican tax plan passes, 1031 exchanges will be limited to real estate only. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:21:32
You’re supposed to pay taxes on it. For example if you bought .25 BTC for $100 and now you buy a computer for $2,000 with that .25 BTC you’re supposed to pay capital gains on the $1,900. 
That’s my understanding of it however I’m not an accountant. Also if it was me in the scenario I wouldn’t be reporting the capital gains. If it was something big like a house or a car, I’d probably report any gains. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:34:13
Because you can buy bitcoin and withdrawal it but you can't withdrawal cash. So people are using the cash the already have on there to buy BTC so the can withdrawal, thus inflating the price of BTC. 
At least that's how I understand the situation. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:10:31
I’m not sure what regular use amounts to in your scenario but this is for a savings account so you only get 6 withdrawals each billing cycle before you get hit with withdrawal fees (pretty sure this is a government regulation). If you regularly have less than $300 and you’re using the money to buy groceries, pay rent, gas, etc the money should be in a checking account and not a savings account.
Just playing devil’s advocate here, not trying to attack you. I do think that some of the fees banks charge are excessive, I just don’t think that this is one of them.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:32:03
Gemini only sells BTC and ETH. GDAX sells BTC, ETH, and LTC. So if you want other coins you'll need to look elsewhere.

They don't realize that's your Twitter not the LA Times author's twitter
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:55:59
I've used both. GDAX is run by Coinbase but it has lower fees than the Coinbase exchange since it's geared toward trading.

They just sent an email out.
A little over a month ago we published an announcement regarding our ongoing engineering efforts to allow withdrawal of bitcoin cash (BCH) for customers who had bitcoin balances at the time of the chain split.
We are pleased to announce that as of Saturday, October 7, 2017, Gemini will allow all customers to view their BCH balance and request a withdrawal via the BCH withdrawal request page.  If you choose to request a BCH withdrawal, your entire BCH balance will be transferred to your chosen withdrawal address. 
BCH requests are not sent onto the blockchain immediately. The first time we will process all submitted BCH withdrawal requests will be Wednesday, October 11 at 1pm EDT. After that point, requests will be honored within 5 business days from the time of your request. Example: If you request on Saturday, October 21, 2017, your transfer will be executed on or by Friday, October 27, 2017.
Although we do not currently have plans to open order books for BCH trading, we will continue to update our customers as the BCH situation evolves further. 
Thank you for your patience and understanding throughout the implementation of this withdrawal feature. If you have any questions, please contact us.  
Onward and Upward!
Team Gemini

I wanted to buy $100 when I set up my Gemini account but they had a $500 ACH limit and I put it all towards BTC. It was like $10 in January. 
I'm still learning my way around crypto and it was easy enough to buy since I didn't have to convert BTC to it 
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:34:21
It's going to cost you more than .2 ETH to file a lawsuit. Also no one is going to jail over $20 in bitcoin. 
I get the frustration and anger but you cant really do anything at this point. I think you need to just sit tight until July and hope you can withdrawal when they say you can. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:39:26
Coinbase doesn't do instant in the way your talking about. You should have received an email that said you purchased x amount of BTC at whatever the price was and the coins will be delivered on a date. Typically the date is a week or so out. 
So you probably did two BTC purchases that are going to show in a week or so. 
No need to panic. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:53:26
I use Gemini over coinbase. Lower fees and for bank transfers the bitcoin is in your account instantly. You can't transfer it out until your deposit clears, but you can trade it if you wanted. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:04:40
I'm pretty sure you should be able to check your history on coinbase and see the pending transactions. 
Also I'd highly recommend not cancelling the second transaction at your bank. This isn't like an Amazon order. If you have your bank reject the second transfer coinbase is going to think you're scamming them. Let it go through and if you need the money, sell the coins when you get them. You might make or lose a few bucks but you'll keep your account. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:07:06
I'm no expert, but just because you transfer them doesn't mean you sold them. You could have transferred them to another wallet you control. So even if coinbase gives up data, just seeing coins leave doesn't mean they were sold. 
Not that I'm advocating tax fraud, but the government probably won't bother you unless you're buying tens of thousands of computers each week I'd imagine. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:17:15
Ahhh. I've only used ACH transfer. Maybe they consider a debit card to be the same thing as an ACH transfer. 
Thanks for clarifying on my comment.

Assuming the OP is talking about a taxable account, capital gains come into play as soon as you sell it. Quickly reinvesting it over into stocks doesn't extinguish any capital gains liability. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 23:36:25
I'm not an expert but I thought a cold wallet is one that isn't connected to the internet and a hot wallet is one that is connected to the internet. 
It sounds like you are planning on buying this computer and hooking it up to the internet. If a cold wallet is your end game then you'll need to buy a separate computer and never connect it to the internet until you're ready to move the coins. 
I think that's how it works.  
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:26:31
I respect that you're trying to make it right, however I don't think you should be on the hook for 100% of this. Your friends should have done some research and taken an active role in managing their investment. Especially if they were computer illiterate, I'd imagine they'd have left the funds on the exchange anyway. I think it's more than fair, that if you feel guilty about it then give them back what fiat they started with. 
All that said, if you're really going to buy 20 bitcoins on small increments I'd use Gemini instead of coinbase. Coinbase fees are much steeper. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:15:34
I believe it was A&amp;W that introduced a third pound burger for the same price as McDonald's quarter pounder. It didn't end up selling as well as they expected and when they polled the public for why it failed, the consensus was why would you pay the same price for less meat. 
Just today, my grocery store had milk on sale. A half gallon was $1.29 and a full gallon was $2.79. Why anyone would buy the full gallon if they needed it is beyond me. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:27:39
I understand what you're saying, but technically you're supposed to be paying taxes on this because you know what the value of the goods/services you're exchanging the coins for. I don't think the government will be hunting you down though for buying computer equipment though.
