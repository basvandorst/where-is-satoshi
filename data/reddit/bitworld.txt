I suggest you this program: 
For this application to work, I think you will need to have the official bitcoin-qt application installed too 
It will take some hours for to download the "blockchain" files, then you can fully use it.
Then create an wallet with a strong password with armory and transfer your coins there. Then make a digital backup as well as a paper backup (just in case), and store them in different mediums (usb, compressed and military encrypted on your email...) and different locations (in case of fire), then delete everything from your pc (the armory wallet files)
You are your own bank now, at least try not to leave much money in wallets if you dont plan to use them. Experiment with small ammounts and take a look at how change works with each wallet software, if you don't spend the full ammount in an address, the change usually goes to a different address. Also if you make a bitcoin transfer in some applications, you should make a backup, because the last one won't work, but this depends on the application. Make backups as much as possible, and test if your methods work.
You have bitcoin wallets for mobile too, in android bitcoinspinner seems very good

Also I would suggest multibit (lots of features, it doesn't need to download the blockchain like electrum) or armory (very secure and with lots of features, but it needs to download the blockchain with Bitcoin-qt installed)
Make a partition in ext4 file format and put some linux love there (well, you will need also another small partition beside for swap, like 1 or 2 gb). You will have all the wallets you like and less errors.
You can then import your wallets (bitcoinqt, electrum, armory, multibit...), you just need to put the wallet files inside their correspondent folders

Some suggestions:
- make a wiki with all the changes done to this distro compared to an standard ubuntu installation, so everyone could recreate it, and make suggestions. Also if someone doesn't trust your distro, he could make it himself with the official ubuntu
- base it on a hardened and secured version of ubuntu, there must be some for sure.
- include more wallets like armory (this should be a must have), electrum or multibit
- install addons to firefox or chrome that make them more secure:
like https everywhere, adblock, ghostery, noscript...
- include bastille, and try to harden the general security of your distro with it
- include a firewall activated by default
- include a light weight desktop enviroment like Lxde
- make 2 versions, one lightweight and another huge. Space should not be a problem nowadays, when you can use a usb or a dvd
how do you make the isos?

The price in dollars of bitcoin is not what's important here.
Many people doesn't have access to a bank account, or a paypal equivalent system. Also they wouldn't have to worry about the devaluation of the money issued by their current government (in some countries like Zimbawe this has been a big issue). 
Something about M-Pesa in Africa

I'm sure you have already looked into the M-Pesa system. Are you planning to add support for something alike? For what I've seen, M-Pesa is beeing used widely with the most simple phones, I guess by sms. These "feature phones" are still expensive for many people, and also you would need internet
Possible sollutions for those with no internet could be to transfer bitcoins in many other ways:
- sms
- bluetooth
- QR codes for those with cameras
Also don't show dirty nails on a picture ;)

Idea: Offer to sell North Korean silver coins on  or on Silk Road. Those coins are difficult to get and some collectionists would like them. Even the normal coins or tipical things from North Korea would do.
Also you could raise up a bounty (crowdfunding) to kill your leader, I'm sure you would get enough funds for anyone that does it.

I'll gladly help you to install the linux version you prefer (it takes no more than 10 minutes usually while you can play cards or browse the web). You can install it alongside windows,  or even onto a usb. You can install electrum and any other wallets on it in 2 clicks. It will be easier and even more secure. Pm me, I could guide you through phone, Google, Skype...
Windows is too much of a headache to fix. Use this program to install Kubuntu onto a usb (my suggested version, it looks like windows on steroids). It will run "live" from the usb without installing out on the pc. You could later install it onto your hardrive, but if you plan on doing so, you need to know a couple of things about partitioning, it will be easy.
Be cautious, ask anything first. I hope you get everything solved
Also remember to enable "boot from usb" at the bios  (pressing f1, or f2 or del, it is written when you turn on the pc, you will enter a blue menu)
Kubuntu uses qt4 and python (like electrum), to install electrum you will only need to paste the instructions from electrum website (sudo apt-get install blah blah blah) on the app called konsole, that's it

If you don't want to deal with volatility of a currency, others will for you. There's business to make from it. If you are one, you could even trade in the stock exchanges with those bitcoins in the short term and make a fortune.

That phone looks good, and not branded, and if you think that's old, you should see mine... I would have took a picture of a hand holding a phone like the one with the card, but my phone is old and broken. If someone makes this kind of picture, then both "think of it..." could be aligned on the bottom.
I have it on vectorial graphics, so everything could be modified and improved by others if interested. I'll take your suggestions, but I'd love if someone gives me first a proper picture of a hand with a phone to go with this, an android one please :P
I also like the "Plan B" slogan, I tried to make a t-shirt of it but received many critics. I didn't know those words were hijacked in USA by a parmaceutical industry marketing, there they have very negative connotations. In other countries and languages it sounds funny thought, and it is written the same.
Plan b uses to mean between friends as a "scape plan" or that you are someone's plan b or second option
If you are interested in the billonaire t-shirt go for it, if not many people wants it, I'll lower the quantity to be printed and raise the price a bit, so we can make them anyways

You could also ask a friend too to pay it for you the old way. I can only offer myself for the task but you would need to trust me

no idea, bitcointalk forums (but most people already know all of this there) or wait some days and repost it here. You should start it with the positive things maybe, it sounds too pesimistic right now. There are many reasons why this is a great technology, and people should look at it like so, not as an investment. If you want to completely inform people, you should post pros and cons.

Really, I would have never thought about abortion, those must be a famous pills brand in USA only.
A plan B is just a plan B. It has many funny connotations (maybe that's why that pharma choose this to soften the concept) and it is written the same in many languages.
What's the alternative scape plan?
What's the plan B? at a boring party
That you are someone's plan B or second option
For me it would mean like a "plan on getting bitcoin" and get rich and don't worry about banks and states robbing you, devaluation... It's like a hidden message, and people may even remember your t-shirt years later when they see the logo again and get to know more about bitcoin. Maybe then they will think you were right about bitcoin, that you were intelligent and not just a crazy geek, who knows...

I'm sorry that the "plan b" was hijacked by a pharmaceutical industry in USA for those kind of pills.
I didn't know it, it sounds funny, ambiguous, secretive and without any negative connotation like that in many other countries and languages. I thought it would be the same in USA. I made this because I like it myself. I don't have problems about obscure jokes, but I understand how you wouldn't like to wear this on serious environments or in public and cause misunderstandings like that. I'd support proabortion postpartum for the politicians and bankers of my country however

I had to Google it when user spawnmower pointed it out. I assume plan b are famous pills on USA, but living in Europe I have never heard of it. A plan b can be interpreted in many funny ways though, and if people ask, you can explain ;-)
I used the word fund, because it is how it works that page. You set up a minimum number of t-shirts to produce, and they are cheaper. I wanted them to be cheap, so that everyone including me can get them to spread the word. I confess I rounded the number very little so that I could get one, because shipping to Europe seemed to be the most expensive part. It would be cheaper for me to print them locally as I usually do (I like to print my own designed t-shirts). So no this is not for funding me or any organization. I participate in some, but about bitcoin, I'm the only one I know here. I am trying hard to spread it however, I print my own bitcoin banknotes, and try to pay or make donations with them to friends, local businesses, friends' bars, restaurants, social movements, small local organizations, trade labor unions, hippie vegan places...
That page was the cheapest option I could find, specially for USA, and also for what I read on the technology used for printing, the designs should stay after many washes, which is what I'm looking for, lets see after they arrive.
Plan B is the same in many languages, I need to find some place cheaper to print this for Europe.

but if not, he's saving the world in other ways, his lasts messages said he had moved on and was busy in more important things. Non polluting energy maybe? 
Thanks Satoshi!

EDIT: more disigns: 
I want one like this for myself, I made it as cheap as possible. T-shirts have nice quality for what I read, and the technology used for printing them should make the designs stay good for many years and washes, which is what I want. I hope so too, lets see after they arrive
Unfortunately the site doesn't support bitcoin already, but if you are interested in paying with bitcoins, let me know, it is possible indirectly.
Will I be charged for reserving a shirt?
Nope! We authorize a payment for the amount of the t-shirt, but you will only be charged if the campaign reaches its goal before the deadline. You can cancel your order any time before the campaign reaches its goal by going to  and entering your order number.
How long after the campaign ends will my shirt be delivered?
Domestic orders should take between 10-14 days from the end of the campaign to arrive, international orders take 14-18 days.
If your order hasn't arrived inside the estimated delivery times, please contact our support team.
How much does shipping cost? ATTENTION: this may be wrong, I only paid $3.85 for shipping to europe. It appears when you are going to pay
-Domestic (United States) shipping $3.85 + $.25 for each additional t-shirt. Your shirt should arrive within 10-14 days from the end of the campaign.
-Domestic (Canada) $7.50 + $1 for each additional t-shirt. Your shirt should arrive within 17-21 days from the end of the campaign.
-International shipping is $10.50 + $1 for each additional t-shirt. Your shirt should arrive within 17-21 days from the end of the campaign.
If the campaign doesn't reach its sales goal, will I still be charged?
You will not be charged if the campaign does not reach its sales goal. We'll cancel the payment authorization within 24 hours of the end of the campaign.

Someone should analize bitcoinium, it was updated today

beware that may be a scam.
he will ask you for a non reversible paypal gift payment method. He is not willing to accept any other payment methods, nor does he care about your identity to trust you. Don't trust your money blindly

I mean in a file format that can be modified like .svg or .ai for vector graphic applications like adobe illustrator or inkscape, to move the images within or change the words without losing quality. The one you posted is a simple image in low res that can not be modified.
Is this originally yours?

Well, I'm not sure how bit can be translated properly, as maybe it means a quantity of information in computers. This is a new term for most languages. In most of the languages bitcoin is the word used, but maybe written different depending on the alphabet

you can just open an account on an exchange, and if you live in USA you have many ways to deposit money. Also you could use localbitcoins.com for example, althought that's usually more expensive
prices  on the top you have the main exchanges mtgox btce bitstamp bitcoin24 bitfloor more
do not use bitcoin24 for now, nor mtgox (takes weeks for an account)

Everyone can report there too whatever they want
BREAKING NEWS: 
"North Korea invades USA, bans all national currencies and declares bitcoin as the international currency"
If people tries to make up negative news, it just means they are trying to bring down the price because they want to buy.

Exactly, it is better if you keep most bitcoin offline.
Try Armory, it is a great app for pc. There are also apps for mobile.
Some basic security tips that may be useful for you: 
- disable java in your web browser ( google "disable java firefox" or "disable java chrome")
- Use a firewall in your operating system
- Use linux or an antivirus

this smells like scam:
- Paypal gift cards are non reversible payments (unlike regular paypal methods). So you have to trust to send them your money and hope they will send you bitcoins.
- price is ridiculously high
- there is no reputation system of any kind here. I'd recommend you to use  or  instead

But I suppose that you would need to have your iphone jailbroken, and allow to install apps from outside the appstore. Almost anyone I know with an iphone knows how to do things like that.

No, this 
like the images from here in svg 
They can be modified, move and alterate components easily from inside the image without losing quality
My guess is that this is not your original design and you are just modifying a low res jpg image with photoshop.

I wish that was true, so I could buy a lot and let them rise. Right now I'm broke in all kinds of money.
But you should take into consideration its potential, the technology, why people likes it or not, its advantages over other payment systems, the merchants acceptation, its enemies and competitors that want it to fail... Volatility is just one factor, and is to be expected at this stage, and it has solutions
Something interesting:

Let me guess, you open them, you paint them (scratching or with a pattern) and you put some glue to preserve them inside.
There's no patience enough in the world to use those things, they were very frustrating. But thats the opinion from someone that breaks rubrik cubes to solve them too.

it is licensed as "dowhatthefuckyouwantwithit" for now, but I plan on claiming copyright of it someday and buy a beach with its royalties...
The original idea is from user smeggletoot I think
The picture on the left is from a USA advertisement. The picture on the right I found it on the internet, I would preffer if someone could give me a picture with a phone and a hand in a similar position to the picture on the left. So it would look better

Maybe if they could afford computers or smartphones. They should guillotine their leaders first.

Really, I would have never thought about abortion, those must be a famous pills brand in USA only.
A plan B is just a plan B. It has many funny connotations in other countries and it is written the same. 
What's the alternative scape plan?...
What's the plan B? at a boring party..
That you are someone's plan B or second option...
For me it would mean "plan on getting bitcoin" and don't worry about Cyprus, devaluation, and maybe even get filthy rich one day. It's like a hidden message, and people may remember it years later
Here's a t-shirt of "plan bitcoin" I made for myself, if anyone else is interested in getting it.
