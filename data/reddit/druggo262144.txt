I think it's pretty clear that I understood that. What I don't understand is why that is relevant. Are you two a couple of parsers? Do you return errors when you can't lex the sentences?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:22:51
are you that fucking stupid as to not understand slightly broken english? are you some sort of computer that needs 100% gramatically correct english? beep boop? want a battery?

You are clearly very angry and mentally limited and I won't read your reply nor reply you ever again.

I have my downvotes because I don't agree with the average, stupid person who thinks he / she is above someone if he notices a couple of grammar mistakes.
By the way, a sentence is supposed to be ended with a period. FYI. I think you are severly mentally retarded and I laugh at your cretinism.

I know you want to be paranoid and whatever but give me a better way to prove this. A screenshot or a transaction hash would reduce the chances of me being a troll, or whatever, by a trivially small percentage.
I seriously hope you didn't want to 'test a troll' by just requesting a stupid timestamp, or an easily modifiable screenshot of a modifiable web page.

    To deposit BTC to your trading
    multisignature wallet, please use the following address:
    *hash here*
    or scan the QR code: 
    *image of a QR code*
Btw, this is the email they send you after you press the envelope icon in the app when you want to deposit BTC to your account. 
Troll detected, you obviously never used the app.

Don't call me troll for no reason. That's my problem. I didn't insult you for no reason.
I contacted them but are you seriously saying that this is normal? It's not. Cryptocurrency exchanges are pure shit and they should stop acting like this, they're damaging the whole concept of cryptos.
If you don't criticize them, they won't do shit. We will have Mt Goxes happen every year and nobody will say anything because "just contact support and hope that you can get your coins back ;)"

I'm not sure how that could prove anything.
1. I could give you any transaction hash that was approved recently
2. In any screenshot, I could use photoshop.
3. On any page, in any screenshot, I can just use 'inspect page' and modify the html and insert any text.
Try to think of a better kind of proof and I will supply you with it.

I checked both and no.
I checked online, the address has the BTC. 
I don't give a damn about it anymore, I already hate this stupid exchange and I hope it dies soon. This is unacceptable. This is what you get from investing $10 into your website and building your shitty 'startup' with code taken from fiverr.com jobs.
Can't wait for this to get solved so I can transfer my money back to Bittrex and GTFO fast to a different exchange.

What are the chances of a troll picking a random, small, irrelevant exchange and just picking on it for no reason? 
On the other hand, what are the chances of a cryptocurrency exchange not giving a damn about the customers and stealing their money? *cough* mt gox *cough*
Thanks for insulting me! My opinion is that I think you're a troll. Nobody clinically sane has such a weak grasp on basic probability. Maybe it's Dyscalculia?
And no, I'm not doxing myself. Thank you.

Then who the hell sent me this email? Santa Claus? And what a coincidence, it contained the same hash as the one from the application.
I know I'm overreacting but it's funny that every time someone acts like a smartass online and starts an argument (and calls someone names, like "troll") they're always wrong.
