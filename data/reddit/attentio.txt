People are paying like crazy to buy bitcoins. Indeed. But they are not spending them like crazy are they? That's my point.
A payment method that is not benefical to the customer is not viable as a payment method. Why would people pay in bitcoin if they lose every protection they have with Visa/MC/Paypal by doing so? Why would they buy things using bitcoins if that means sacrificing part of their investment?
The advantages of bitcoin for merchants is obvious, no one can argue against that.  But for customers, it's a whole different story... And for business to happen, you have to have both. That's why I think "bitcoin as a payment system" is not viable, unless the customer can benefit too.
For silk road for instance, customers use bitcoins because bitcoin transactions have the advantage of being anonymous. But if paypal or visa was anonymous, potheads wouldn't buy using bitcoins... In regular businesses, anonymity is not something everyone is looking for.

What is your stance on the deflationnary aspect of the bitcoin? Because of that, even when the user base has stabilized (assuming a growing economy), the more you wait, the richer you are. Who will spend their coins at one moment if when they wait, they'll end up paying less?
Central banks fight against deflation with inflation because otherwise, noone would spend their money. And if noone spended their money, economy would stall, wouldn't it?.
I think this is the biggest flaw of the bitcoin, because it makes it unsuitable to use it as a currency. And if it does not have the "new mean of payment" aspect to it, and with no intrinsect value to it, it will undoubtedly fall sooner or later.

Mined for several days in a row w/ my laptop. GPU PWM fan never passed 60%, temps were very much okay. Don't make generalizations on laptops because MBCs are poorly cooled.
