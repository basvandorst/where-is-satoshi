Basically create valid addresses until it finds a match to the name you want. Because computers are so fast it can go through thousands of addresses in seconds. It'd be a neat little project actually. 
Programming is fun. There are a ton of courses on the internet that can get you started for free.
It's probably one of the most useful hobbies you could have, and literally _anyone_ can do it. There's no magic, and no one is "too stupid" to figure it out, and you _don't_ need  to be good at math. It's literally just about how long youve practiced. 
If you've ever had more even a passing interest, look into it, it's hard but it's worth it.

So this is actually a really good reason why top Hodlers should actually convert to a sizable amount of fiat: With fiat comes the ability to promote digital currencies in mainstream media channels. 
I've seen a lot of talk about this being a bubble because 'non-investors' are getting into BTC. We want non-investors- we _need_ non-investors because it's _not supposed to be an investment._ 
A rising tide lifts all ships, and converting BTC to Marketing (via fiat) _is an investment_. It's also the perfect opportunity because there is the awareness of digital currency has hit the mainstream. Top Hodlers should seize that opportunity.

Actually he's referring to the massive problem of foreign money making Vancouver (well, all of the lower mainland/Vancouver Island) literally too expensive to live.
Rich Chinese citizens are incentivized to get their money out of China, because their Government can take their money at any time. Canada's surprisingly loose laws and immigration loopholes make it a prime target for this kind of capital redistribution.
They'll send their kid to Canadian university, who will have no income but a couple million dollar houses in their name, skipping taxes, they'll lease Lambos and Ferrari's (its actually become a sick joke at UBC).
And that's not even getting into the Vancouver Model, where Chinese fentanyl producers/triads will wash their opioid money in Vancouver casinos, buy up all the real estate in Vancouver behind numbered businesses, all the while contributing to what can only be described as fucking epidemic (death by opioids is number 1 killer of males over 30 in Canada. Go figure).
The point is, Canada has deeply flawed laws, surprisingly massive amounts of corruption, and doesn't have the leadership to fix it. So when buddy in Vancouver complains about ethnically Chinese 18 year old driving a Lambo, he's not disparaging some hard working family thats run a corner store for a few decades, he's pointing to one of the more garish symptoms of foreign capital that is suckling the life out of Canada's west coast.

Oh, blackmarket implications is the first legitimate point I've found in this thread. 
Blackmarket BitCoin "exchanges" would be massively profitable. Maybe not enough to prevent a "ban" (ie. severe restrictions on the ability to acquire and use btc), but it might be enough for them to consider heavily regulated exchanges. 
I'd expect the Chinese Government more interested in controlling the flow of btc in China than outright banning it. I may be mistaken, but I thought there was a big push from the top to try and curtail some of the grosser forms of corruption. I would assume that they would be sensitive to opening new avenues of corruption (blackmarket btc). 
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:47:27
As a noob I feel much less secure about having it on an easily stolen|dropped|bricked phone than a silicon valley backed regulated exchange hold them for me. 
Then again I don't have a very large position on CoinBase. _Never risk more than you're willing to lose._ If I had significant position being held by CB then I'd have a lot more incentive to offline them. 
I feel the barrier to entry for holding coin off exchanges is still fairly high for non-technical persons. That's going to push mainstream adoption to be through exchanges- you can't have it go mainstream if it's complicated.

I do like LiteCoin because it solves some of the issues hampering Bitcoins growth out of the box. I like it because it seems like an honestly built coin- less likely it will be pump and dump ICO scam shit. And since development is transparent, [antagonistic code reviews help reveal issues before they become huge issues]( 
I also like it because I get to be in on the ground floor, and I regret not getting into BTC when I first heard about it. 
So to me, LTC seems like a good investment. Not a huge investment, but worthy of taking a small position. Again, it's going to be different for everyone. Right now LTC is a very risky bet, because there's no way to calculate adoption- not to mention how risky crypto is overall. But the research I've done points to it being good enough to warrant investment.

I'm actually really liking LTC. It's a lot less stressful than the other coin and the community is great.
Honestly, as much as I like seeing my networth skyrocket from BTC gains, it feels like it could drop just as quickly. I guess Im more of a slow and steady "investor", and LTC gives me that feeling of confidence.

For a long time I was upset I missed the boat. I remember seeing the hacker news post when BitCoin had just launched. But I didn't get in on the mining before the boom. 
Then I didn't want to spend fiat on it until I had gotten rid of my fiat debts. By the time I did that i was upset, $1000 CAD a coin! Prices never higher! 
But I purchased a few coin anyways. And I'm up &gt;50% within _months_. Now I feel I'm part of something, even if it's a small part. 
Anyone who feels they missed the boat, coin is the cheapest it's ever going to be.
