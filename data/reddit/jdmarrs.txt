Won’t Lightning Network allow us to use bitcoin for everyday transactions?

I’ve heard a lot of American/European Ex-Pats live in Chiang Mai, Thailand, so it would make sense if Bitcoin is flourishing there. Seems to be an international hub, and not as touristy as Bangkok or Phuket.

Bitcoin (upper case) is a payment system, and bitcoin (lower case) is a currency. Credit cards do not compete with bitcoin, but they compete with Bitcoin.

JPM Coin is basically an intranet instead of the internet. One is closed-source, permission-based, centralized, concentrated, censored, fee-based, and controlled. The other is open-source, permissionless, decentralized, distributed, censorship-resistant, no cost to use, and free. Guess which one will win? Why is the entire world using the open internet instead of a closed intranet controlled by Microsoft or some other corporation? Bitcoin is the Internet of Money, and history will repeat itself.

The difference is that exchanges can be decentralized. Banks are centralized. You don’t need to trust people at a decentralized exchange because it can run completely autonomously using smart contracts. I think in the future there will be ways to securely manage keys in an easy way. Ember Fund is one exchange that is going in this direction... the keys never leave your smartphone, and the exchange interface is simple and easy. You just need to keep track of your smartphone, then if your phone gets lost or stolen, recover your account using a recovery seed.

Yes, some people will loan out their coins, and others will HODL them. At least it will be easy to manage your finances by yourself, and you won’t need to use a bank/exchange unless you want to. Whereas today you are practically forced to use a bank or payment processor to store/spend your money. In the future, finance will be decentralized, and those who want to manage their finances by themselves will be able to do so, while those who prefer to use a custodian will still have that option, although hopefully with lower fees and better service than today due to the competitive forces of having other options than being forced to use a cartel of banks and financial institutions.

What is the intrinsic value of the Google search engine or Microsoft Windows? Those are just 1s and 0s as well. The value of software is its utility. Bitcoin is valuable because it is scarce and useful.

We should start a class action lawsuit against BofA. Also close our BofA accounts and let them know we are closing because of their decision to not allow cryptocurrency purchases. We can vote with our wallets.

I've been using Bitcoin as a ShamWow. It's great at cleaning up all those financial messes created by banks and governments. But wait there's more! Order now and Billy Mays will sell you two for the price of one. That's two Bitcoin at less than $10k each, which normally sell for $20k per Bitcoin.

The volatility of cryptocurrency will decrease as the industry matures and the market cap increases. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was just as volatile as Bitcoin when it first got started.

Global fiat currency market cap is $100 trillion, so he is assuming cryptocurrency will displace 5% of all fiat currency (M1 and M2) within 4 years. Seems reasonable to me, given the many blockchain applications that will exist by then. I could imagine 5% of the global economy running on blockchain within 4 years. What percentage of businesses in the economy were using the internet 15 years after it was invented? Probably at least 5%.
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:05:36
It won't be a problem when most people start spending/accepting cryptocurrency directly instead of converting back to fiat currency. There will be a natural tendency for people to hold on to cryptocurrency so they can interact with the segments of our economy that are driven by the blockchain. I makes no sense to pay fees to convert from fiat to cryptocurrency every time you want to fulfill a smart contract, and then pay more fees to convert from cryptocurrency back to fiat. People will keep a portion of their wealth in cryptocurrency for all their interactions/business/transactions with the blockchain.

FYI, if you want to see an early blockchain application, you should check out Steemit. There are also many distributed applications being written for Ethereum.

If he can get it on the ballot, the idea will at least gain more awareness, and it has a shot at passing at some point in the future, just like what happened with marijuana legalization in California. He is focused on winning a long-term war, not a short term battle. I think he knows it probably wouldn't pass the first time it made it to the ballot.

We can basically already scale to that level with Bitcoin on Lightning Network, Litecoin, Ethereum, etc.

He's a Silicon Valley legendary venture capitalist, and a billionaire. When a successful billionaire makes several correct predictions, perhaps his opinion has more merit than that of an average person.

He was correct about Bitcoin hitting $10k by 2018.

Imagine 5 years from now you drive your car to a gas station or electric charging station to fill/charge up. Would you rather:
A) Waste a couple minutes getting out your credit card, swiping it, navigating the menu interface, entering your ZIP code, entering your phone number to apply rewards discounts, wait a minute for the credit card to be approved, then finally proceed to fill up/charge, get charged an extra 3% for using a credit card, and then push a button to print out a paper receipt.
B) Start immediately pumping/charging. A blockchain smart contract immediately debits your Ethereum wallet. You could authorize the transaction with your smartphone, hardware wallet, or perhaps automatically through private keys stored on the car's computer itself. After refuelling/charging, drive away, and get sent an email/text message/electronic receipt if you have previously chosen to receive receipts/notifications. In addition to saving time and effort , you save 3% for using cryptocurrency instead of a credit card.
Bonus: If you have a self-driving electric car, your car can charge up automatically while you are away (e.g., you park your car in the parking lot at work, and it drives itself to a charging station to charge itself while you are working).
Extra Bonus: While you are working and not using your car, you can also opt to allow your self-driving car to work for you and be an Uber/Lyft for people, who will automatically  pay with Ethereum. The smart contract will automatically optimize the schedule and driving routes to maximize the profit you earn.
Another Bonus: While you are working, or while your car is charging, your car's computer can mine cryptocurrency. These additional revenue streams potentially allow your car to pay for itself, and/or provide you with free fuel/electricity.

Those regulations weren't in place when the DJIA first launched. It was a wild ride. Roaring 20's, Black Tuesday, etc.

If you are within the same order of magnitude, that is correct enough for cryptocurrency, considering that Bitcoin started out at less than a dollar.

1 Bitcoin today is still 1 Bitcoin tomorrow. As long as you stay in cryptocurrency, you have nothing to worry about. It is the value of the fiat currency that is fluctuating so rapidly. Cryptocurrency is inherently deflationary, whereas fiat currency is inherently inflationary.

It's insane that credit card companies charge vendors 2%-3% for every transaction. That is a huge amount of money, especially if you are a low-margin business like a food truck. Imagine getting an extra 25%-50% profit just by switching to cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Vendors won't be able to resist adding cryptocurrency as a payment platform due to the additional revenue stream and lower transaction fees. There are many businesses that charge you extra money for using a credit card or just don't accept credit cards as payment, due to the high fees.

He also predicts that in 5 years, people will laugh at you and get embarrassed if you try to pay for something with fiat currency. Everyone will be using cryptocurrency by then. We are at the beginning of the S curve for technology adoption for cryptocurrency. First people mock the idea of a new technology, then they eventually realize they can't live without it. The same thing happened at the dawn of personal computers, the internet, and cellphones.

It's simple: send an extremeley cheap (1 Satoshi) or even free/invalid (0 Satoshi) transaction to an address. Confirm that it is sent/received correctly before sending the actual amount of bitcoin intended to be sent. It's like pinging the address before sending actual crypto/data. This could be automated fairly easily, at least to confirm that the address is real rather than fake. And if you are sending money to a previously unknown/unused address, you can be prompted to confirm. Eventually, there could be a DNS service, so you are typing something that is more human readable like a website address (e.g., [reddit.com]( or an email address rather than an IP address or wallet address.
