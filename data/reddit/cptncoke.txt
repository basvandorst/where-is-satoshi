This is important.  Extremely important, not because of the fact that someone PAID Bitcoins to get a pizza, but because someone ACCEPTED Bitcoins to provide a service and a product.  
At that time Bitcoin was barely a concept, pretty far from a useful means of payment.  You see, for a currency to have value It must be accepted by other people.  One of the facts that make the US Dollar so valuable is that basically everybody accepts It.  
And that moment when the first person in the world said "ok I'll get your Bitcoin for my services" proved to be a turning moment in history.  It transformed an idea into a world first, borderless currency.
That's why It's historical, not because of the price paid.

If the miners stop mining the difficulty will drop, making mining interesting for more people, so OTHER people will start mining.  Remember that ANYONE can mine.  It's genius.  It does not depend on anyone.

No one knows, really.  Study It and decide for yourself.  No "authority" will endorse It.  You have to understand that that's the most valuable thing in Bitcoin.  No one can touch It but yourself.  When you study how money works and is created you realise you just have to have some.

What if the spike in Mastercard use breaks their network?  Then the media will talk about It nonstop showing huge lines of people in front of ATMs, which will only prompt more people to the nearest ATM, and the panic will start.
Things happen fast when EVERYBODY is rushing in the same direction and the media feeds gasoline to the fire in a nonstop vicious circle.
A few month ago in Brazil the [truck drivers went on a strike ](  Just a regular strike.  But over there 99% of the economy depends on them, including the gas for pump on Gas stations.
First there were the huge lines on gas stations, that lasted for 24 hours, until their tanks were emptied.  Then people realised food, water, medicine, NOTHING was being delivered.  There was a rush for that too, but nothing insane.
And then the Gas in peoples autos and public transport tanks finished.  Schools were closed and semi-holidays (optional days) were decreed.
in about 5 days the country (the worlds 8th or 9th biggest economy, if I'm not mistaken) stopped functioning.
In Alaska they say that It's not the winter that gets you, It's being badly prepared for the winter that gets you.
People sound crazy until something happens and a chain reaction starts.  By then It's too late.
I say a stash of water, gas, and mostly Bitcoin is essential.
u/GabeNewell_ gets It.

Just be prepared to sell when It goes Ballistic.  It fells great to see your investment going up and up.  But It will crash fast, so don't be too gready and sell before It's too late.

\+1 keep it to yourself.  Their only two options is FOMO and buy at the top, or stick to their narrative and keep trash talking Bitcoin all the way to USD200K.
Let's think together:
1 - All the fundamentals of Bitcoin are going strong.  Hash Rate, Number of wallets, usage...  That's your main focus of thought.  Bitcoin is doing fine, regardless of price. Hence "HODL".
2 -People don't put in the time and effort to study Bitcoin.  They do what other people do.  The follow the heard.
3 - People don't see the studying, the effort, the time and the risk rich people take to get there.  They label rich people as lucky, or born in advantage.   They just keep grinding at jobs they hate, partying at weekends, and live on debt all their lives.
4 - Also It's important to put long term gains ahead of short term gains.  Put aside the Bitcoin bubbles and the ballistic price moves.  Bitcoin is better thought out as a five year plus investment.
So, trust me.  Just keep It to yourself.  Make sure you hold your private keys and back them up.

It's not so much about how little Bitcoin is being used but how shitty this sub's posts have become.

ELI5: Quantum computer is millions of times more powerfull, in theory.  So, in theory, that massive ammount of computation could be used to attack the Bitcoin network (e.g. a 51% attack). Also It could be used to crash the crypto algorithm.

My guess is banks have two options:  1-Lobby so the government strangle the technology, or 2 - Make an "in house" blockchain and call themselves up to the new tech.  However, the new tech is peer to peer, or It's just another database.
Bitcoin will not replace the dollar or Banks, but It's going to change the financial scene, because It's going to bite a slice of that pizza one way or the other.

I loved It.  Bitcoin needs more of that type of initiative.  Keep It up!

I think bitcoin has the potential for a 10% of the gold market.  10%.  That would price it at around 70k.  
There are 90 trillion in derivatives around the world.  The point is there's a lot of investment money out there.
Any serious investor in 2019 should put 1% in bitcoin because the assimetry (pottential losses vs pottential gains) is just astronomical.

A lot of finance companies are doing that, and now the ones that are not doing It are the ones that are "left behind", or not up to date, etc....so that will push every finance company and news outlets to do It.
And the same will happen with adoption.

Hummm...i've paid for numerous internet services with bitcoin (PIA , namecheap) and I have even paid for B&amp;Bs in Africa with btc.
But let's see:
- Internet of money
- permitionless
- no bounderies
- for people and business alike. No distinction.
- government, banks and ex wifes can't steal.
- potential growth of internets and smart phones and IOF in the future.
- growth of decentralized services, like Uber.
All that stuff makes It pretty fucking valuable to me.  And If It's good for me It's good for a whole bunch of people, because I'm lazy, I don't like expensive fees and I hate stupid bureaucracies.

 Don't worry about what ifs, It's pointless, since if we look backwards everybody would be happy because we would only have had the best possible decision at any time in our lives. 
Start again.  Get some while you can.  We are in the beginning, still. The vast majority of the world's population has no idea what crypto is or think It's just dumb internet money that you can't buy anything with.   To think like that circa 2010 was what intelligent people did, so you are 100% free of any fault.  Now imagine the people that **still** think like that?  They should be freaking out in ten years.
Read Internet of Money by Andreas Antonopoulos.  You will see what mean.

This is security 101 - BE YOUR OWN BANK:
Bitcoin and Crypto in general is a new tech and we are all learning how to deal with It.  One of the first lessons we've learned was that exchanges were the weakest link in the chain of transforming USD to crypto.  It is a trustless tech because we don't have to trust anyone in the chain.  When you leave your Bitcoin with an exchange you TRUST an entity that you don't know who operates, what their security mesures are and where they operate from.  You are basically asking for a complete stranger on the other side of the world to hold your money for you.  It sounds like a stupid thing to do because It is stupid.  Banks do a FAR better job at that than exchanges, plus they give you guarantees.
So far the statistics are: 
\- Number of exchanges hacked: A lot
\- Number of wallets hacked: ZERO
Without the private keys, no wallets have ever been breached and Its funds stolen.  It is the safest way to store your crypto, period.  Hardware wallets go one step further and provide a way to store your Private Keys in a dongle outside of your computer/ disconnected from the Internet.  
Exchanges are a tool for exchanging USD into Bitcoin and vice versa.  It's for temporary use.  Wallets are for storing Bitcoin.
If you don't do that, you don't understand how Bitcoin works.

Miners are part of the structure that makes decentralization work.  Bitcoin and blockchain is dead without them.
