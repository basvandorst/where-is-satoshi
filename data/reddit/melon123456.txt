What are txfees at now? I feel like they already jumped... my electrum wants the Oct 2017 equivalent for Txfees.
Fucking sucks. Coins are stuck.
What do
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:47:39
How do I double spend? I can't do anything with my coins and have a test transcation fucking stuck.
All my other low fee went thru and now electrum wants an arm and leg like its oct 2017 again.

How credible is this source?
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:23:56
Any luck so far? I haven’t decided honestly.

Ahhh I have that but unfortunately I use BRD wallet on iOS as an an intermediary wallet after I buy my coins on Coinbase then move them to my Electrum wallets. 
 I have heard Greenwallet has those features but for some reason I stopped using it. I know electrum has this features and it’s great. 
Is there any way to speed up a transaction without using those methods above? A way to accelerate it into a block or increase the speed idk.

Are you looking for one on iOS or what platform?
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:01:03
Wow that is amazing thank you! 
Do you use BRD or have in the past?
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:11:20
That is very true. I’m going to definitely make sure I know how to effectively maintain low transaction fees. 
They always do skyrocket.. I guess this is a time where people are slowly getting into it as it approaches 10k again over the next few months ..

Ehh at this point. I might do it since I missed my window where I needed it quickly. 
Still it is crazy how expensive it gets even at non-prime time hours.
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:01:01
Thank you for this. I will go read it now :)
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:24:08
Ahhh thank you. I can definitely utilize these so I can move my coins efficiently if need be. :)

No I didn’t choose economy speed. I use the regular because economy takes too long. I don’t mind anything under $1.00 even though that is too much. $2 is pushing it but $4-8 is insane. I do NOT want to go back to the days of $15-$40 fees depending on how quick you wanted it.

How long would that take to transfer ? I have an ‘economy’ option which is how much it used to be but not anymore.
