Being a college senior as well, I have started looking into being a commodities trader &amp; studying for my series 3 exam (commodities/futures broker --doesn't require firm sponsorship). I'd like to relay what I've learned trading bitcoin into trading oil, coffee, OJ.. etc.

I'm in the same boat, well sortof. I'm a college student close to graduation and I've been looking for entry-level/internship positions involved with the bitcoin protocol or cryptocurrencies in general. It'll be interesting to see how these positions grow along with the market cap

what would be considered a "reasonable" transaction fee on a bitcoin atm? fixed rate or a percentage

can I ask as to your strategy about approaching potential locations to place one of these kind of machines? I just placed an order here in the US and I'm wondering what to expect when I start contacting places very soon
