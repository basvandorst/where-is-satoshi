Also, standard mixing practices are expensive. Joinmarket for example chains 7 to 13 coinjoin transactions in a row. That's a lot of transaction fees you're paying on top of what you pay the liquidity providers.

Get the electrum wallet on a fresh Linux install and sweep the key. Look it up, its easy. Caution: The backup seed for a electrum wallet won't restore private keys that have been sweeped. Keep this in mind.
Just so you know, enter the public bitcoin address in any block explorer like  to see if it has a balance. No risk of anyone stealing your funds this way.

If you want to give the Bitcoin to the lightning hub you're connected to instead of your relatives, then yes.
EDIT: I think we're onto something here.
@_date: 2018-09-21 11:17:10
There's 2 different lock systems on Bitcoin. There is the locktime on a transaction in general, which can be used to sign a transaction sending from your cold storage to your relatives address, but only is valid 5 years from now. Before that time arrives, you simply send your stash to another address, voiding the timelocked transaction before being valid (since the coins moved).
Then there's also script based locktimes, like OP_CSV (check sequence verify - based on block height) and OP_CLTV (check locktime verify - based on block timestamps) which are in the spending conditions assigned to a specific UTXO. But locking with these OPcodes, you would also lock them for yourself. 
I'm not saying there mightn't be an easy way to do inheritance within spending condition scripts, with some if else and multiple keys. The basic locktime approach seems cleaner though.

I personally do not like SW that much. I am impressed with the idea Peter Wuille came up with, but taking signatures out of the blockchain to a separate data store is bad practise imho.
Hashrate and nodes shall decide this, though.
IBLT is something i look forward to being implemented, as it reduces orphan rates and would be an all around healthier approach to scaling than cutting pieces out of the blockchain.

I'm very positive about onion routing in LN. It should be very hard to trace, because you would have to invest a boatload of Bitcoin to have many lightning nodes to do transaction monitoring by being part of enough payment channels. 
Just random thoughts. Looking forward to the release. I'm interested how routing channels is done.

I did, thanks. Been to the Hong King scalability workshop, watched the talk. I oppose the SW approach as it is a major change in the Bitcoin protocol and the way blockchain history is stored. As the core devs oppose BIP101 and other BIPs, this should be rejected as well. It isn't though, and I very much wonder why.

@_date: 2015-06-23 20:01:19
What you essentially have to store is the unspent transaction outputs (UTXO), as these are the outputs that can be inputs in new transactions.
The pruning problem is; How can you be sure those UTXO really exist, because you got to know where they came from up to the point where they where mined to be sure that they are real.

With Napster the police knew very well where to look for the server. But I agree with the OpenBazaar ≈ Bittorrent part. In terms that its decentralized and uses p2p technology.

What do you mean when you say 


@_date: 2015-12-14 13:01:52
I know, putting the merkle root of all sigs in the coinbase tx. I'm just saying we should be careful about splicing stuff away from the blockchain which is needed to verify the past fully.
Having an effective 1.75 block size and a malleability fix are good improvements but I'd like to know more about that dataset holding the sigscripts which are not inside of transactions anymore. How do clients go about storing sigscripts and maintaining them? What if a sigscript "gets lost"?
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:57:00
Because the block header only holds the merkle root of all hashes, so one hash out of all transactions. Without checking where each UTXO came from, you could be presented with UTXOs that aren't real (since you can't check the validity of the merkle root). Therefore you have to at least check/download the block chain once.
I'd love to learn more about block chain pruning, maybe even support with coding. Is there a BIP about this or do I just code away?
@_date: 2015-06-12 02:14:11
On the tor network (silkroad) nobody knows who he is actually talking to.
With OpenBazaar you have servers with known IP addresses running the individual shops.

Good question. I think GPU mined coins are the best approach. As Vertcoin is a GPU mined coin I do not think that Botnets are a huge problem.
Remember, Litecoin and Bitcoin and Dogecoin are (or were) all GPU coins for a long time!
Also, Vertcoin has two p2pool networks with a large amount of network hashrate. This way, there is not even a *potentially evil* pool operator who could misuse this hashrate. What Bitcoin is for Banks, p2pool is for Mining.
Fun Fact; Primecoin, which is a CPU only coin, seems to turn into a GPU coin right about now.

Fair argument, but that mostly only affects CPU mineable coins like Primecoin.
Not every Computer (in a botnet as well) has a high end gaming card, but it's easy enough to aquire unlike new ASIC models.
EDIT: Also, mining malware is easily discovered because it affects the computer performance so much. I think the most profitable and sustainable business for botnets is still phishing/spam mails and selling DDOS.

People don't seem to realize how centralized the mining situation is with Bitcoin. If you have to buy specialized hardware instead of GPUs or CPUs there are less everyday-normal-people able to mine. Since they do not want to invest into &gt;$1000 Mining Hardware, they get left out.
But take a coin like Litecoin or Vertcoin. These GPU coins have a more decentralized mining ecosystem. Also, they have no ASIC producer who likes to literally spit on their customers. With Litecoin, ASICs are developing. Vertcoin is ASIC resistant by design.
ASIC resistance will become very important in the long run.

Litecoin, Feathercoin, Dogecoin. Same mining algo, different name.
Vertcoin and others use a different approach to the way Bitcoin does things (keep ASICs out, anon tx, multi-POW, etc)
Bitcoin won't implement these changes so yes, altcoins are here to stay and will keep having value. Also, I think different coins actually add to the value of Bitcoin, because more is possible with crypto currencies in general this way. (All those GPU miner still stick around, for example)

If you are planing to buy ASICs, don't. Or at least think about it again. You won't get a investment return fast, if ever!
Don't buy ASICs, buy general purpose GPUs and mine a coin like vertcoin, dogecoin, litecoin. This way even if you stop mining your equipment has resell value. Old ASICs drop in value rapidly!

By miners you mean the few companies producing those ASIC chips. They mine for themselves first before selling to customers (after difficulty rise), which means we have 5ish ASIC producers running a big part of the Bitcoin network.
ASICs are a good way to centralize a crypto currency (to some extend).

Download  from github and create a BIP38 encrypted private key. Make sure to use a good password!
Send your Bitcoins to this address. Buy a aluminium cryptocard with your wallet details (its a Canadian service - maybe someone has the link?)
Wrap it up good and hide/bury it somewhere. :)
Also, have a second backup of your encrypted private key on a USB stick. Give it to your friend to store it. If the password is good, he won't be able to spend the coins.

I'd recommend moolah (prelude) because of what it has done for the cypto communities so far, but the biggest volume is traded on cryptsy. Just don't leave your coins on an exchange for long. 
Vertcoin is ASIC resistant. There is a lot of information over at but it boils down to; no ASICs, no mining centralisation, very decentralized and evenly/fair distributed coins. Also a lot of support for p2pool resulting in even more secure distribution of hash rate. It is what Litecoin tried to be.
Feel free to contact me for further questions. :)

Does self-discovery include having your Bitcoins stolen by a browser addon?

Go with the refund. If you want to mine and actually make a ROI, why not look into building a GPU mining rig and mine one of the various cool altcoins? Vertcoin, Darkcoin, Primecoin. All GPU mineable :)

I think it has been called weak blocks as well. It's definitely an interesting concept. A smaller proof of work, similar to a mining pool share, to proof you are really working on a block with transaction a, b, c, ...

Are you attending Bitcoin2014 as well?

Thanks for the input. There is malware out there that changes bitcoin addresses while using copy/paste on a PC. Please tell me how this evolves further.
@_date: 2015-05-22 22:01:06
I second that.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:21:13
But the chart from OP is transactions without popular addresses, so there should be no Satoshi Dice transactions included in the chart.
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:12:36

Cryptsy is an US crypto exchange which offers this feature (auto exchange after deposit of coins). If they really use Cryptsy for this, they'll have a problem rather quickly.

It's a thing from proof of stake coins. You don't move your coins and sometimes generate coins for not moving them. Simultaneously, a block is created through this process.

C. I urge you again to reconsider. They've been working on lightning before they even announced segwit at Scaling Bitcoin HK (Which I attended). Lightning (payment channels) don't depend on segwit. Segwit is blockchain cancer.
You know how Bitcoin works. No matter what, keep your coins in your private keys and you will have coins on both forks. You win no matter which chain wins. Just sit it out. :) 
@_date: 2016-01-06 02:04:01
It sets a standard for double spends. Which is a bad thing.

Greg, blocks are going to grow, believe me. And you and me, we both will have our coins in our UTXOs on both forked chains, Core and Unlimited. As long as some fork away from Bitcoin Core happens, I'll be happy to have coins on that chain as well.

And therefore, how many transactions you can put into these blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:33:23
With segwit you only get a 2 or 3 MB effective blocksize, but what comes after that? Even with payment channels on top, if the new segwit block format hits the new ceiling (called block weight) and many payment channels need to close at once, you will get old states of the channel becoming valid again.

10% still really isn't that good though.

I'd assume they would work without it? Transaction malleability (which segwit appears to fix) is no issue for payment channels.

I share one opinion with them though. Bigger blocks won't hurt. Also, I do not like segwit. So it is my own opinion on the matter that I, as one of Bitcoins many users and holders, want bigger blocks. It's not about conspiracy theories either.

Yes. You can sweep the private key into any wallet that's supports sweeping. So the same key can store BCC and BTC.
Private keys are really the most barebone way to store Bitcoin, I would say.
Sweep means to send it into the wallet as a transaction. It is preferable to importing.

Transaction fee plus 15k satoshi payment to Samourai, which works out to a little more than double the *real* transaction fee.

Exodus is advertising coinswitch as a convenient feature in their wallet. 
I think legally, Exodus *does profit* from the referral fee in his scheme together with Coinswitch, so they definitely should have an incentive to make this right or boot Coinswitch out the door of their product if they want to avoid big trouble later on.
If this is common practice for Coinswitch, it would be better for exodus to distance themselves from such actions. The brand will be tarnished and untrustworthy otherwise. Trust is the number one reason to use any kind of wallet. I know I'm not going to use their wallet, never have.

I mean, every coinjoin is implemented differently. Addresses might be bech32 or P2SH, there might be multiple hops, which allows leeway in the intermediate output amounts (see joinmarket), output amounts generally can differ.
There's SharedSend, Joinmarket, Samourai, Wasabi, just to name a few. To improve classification, perhaps have a peek at a tx from each implementation.

Rubbish you say? Lets say 75% of the network become Classic nodes. And 75% of miners start mining Classic blocks. What's the valid longest chain? The one with 25% hashing power and 25% of nodes? Good luck with that.


Ok. Nodes have a say in this as well. But guess which client node count is rapidly rising as we speak.
At the end of the day. If classic doesn't activate ever, no harm done. But *if* it does there is no turning back. Then Bitcoin is what the majority agrees on, as it has always been. In terms of hashing power and node count. How can you even call that argumentation rubbish?

To be frank, I might be using not enough data to extrapolate that many days into the future. The method I use is in the title, it is named after Monte Carlo.
I take the normalised daily returns, assume a normal distribution, fetch the standard deviation and then calculate future possible random price movements based on that probability distribution and add to that the drift, which is the expected value of the daily returns.
My background is mainly Bitcoin, with a Master of Science in Information technology, but I do finance as a hobby. :)

What shall we use then to predict the unknown future? I am persuaded to assume you know a better way of doing it then. What would be your way of going about it?

Where does the locktime transaction stay until it is mined? It won't be in the mempool as that would clog up the me pool if locktimes in the future catch on.

There is no confidence interval the way I use it, as I just keep plotting.
These are the formulars I've used (top of my head):    
daily return = ln(price{today} / price{yesterday})       
drift = expected value of daily return - (variance / 2)      
random_pricechange = std_deviation * inverse_CDF(random(0, 1))        
future_price{t+1} = price{t} * e^((rand_pricechange + drift))
Just take your favourite exchange price data and estimate a normal distribution over the recent price movements. I'm sure you will calculate very similar values.

So you extrapolate some values into the future while using others from the now? I wouldn't recommend doing that. All bitcoins mined takes 3 more human generations.

He should move the coins once though. Otherwise the seller of the block can move them after receiving payment.

My take is this: Do not use the blockchain.info wallet for anything. If you do, please do not complain if your coins disappear. It happened to often already.
I'd sweep the private key into an electrum wallet. It really depends how much coins you want to move.

This is happening because of the transaction spamming that is going on.

Cold storage means not connected to the internet. Electrum connects to the internet so I'd say its not full cold storage, depending on how you update. Is your whole system offline?
@_date: 2015-10-29 17:19:51
This is what I did now:
from console, I entered
    $ git clone 
    $ cd electrum/
    $ git checkout seed_v10
    $ pyrcc4 icons.qrc -o gui/qt/icons_rc.py
    $ ./electrum
With this version of electrum, I was able to open the wallet and send the funds to a new wallet I created using 2.5.2.
Not the best solution, but if anyone is stuck with the same issue.. this helped me, kinda.
@_date: 2015-10-19 13:48:59

The way I see it there are to many transactions in mempool and just a tiny fraction gets mined into blocks.
Nodes are crashing because they struggle to verify all the transactions. With all the spam, that's a lot of work. Confirmed transactions are just a tiny part.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:50:41
Transactions can be resubmitted. They're already signed and I guess some fucker takes care of the network not forgetting them by resubmitting them every three days.

F2Pool has 24,57% of mining network. 1W average from Blocktrail.
Assuming that blocks are statistically independent, which seems OK taking the 1W average, isn't it just 0.2457^6 * (1 - 0.2457) = 0.000166 ? 
Therefore the chance of it happening would be 0.0166%.

If the mining reward would have been instantly sold, then yes. I think a lot of miners held onto their coins during the price runs though (and maybe some panic sold it all in the crashes). When a bubble happens newly minted coins make no big difference anymore. The run is for the already existing ones, and there were plenty of old coins when the first few bubbles came up.

I sent you a mail with the full output some days ago. I was confused as the "Enter a new address: " input request wasn't clear in all the terminal output. Maybe you remember.
The tumbling process requested a new address at around 11 or 12 out of 14 tx's. That's when I left it running for another day without inputting a new address and then aborted the tumbler. I think that is when it must have happened. That's all I got on this.
EDIT: If it helps, I can send you my wallet.json with the password and you can take a look. But without the stored private keys it won't be possible to retrieve the lost coins I guess. Some coin fractions are already in destination addresses in a separate electrum wallet, from the last and previous tumbling attempts.

It technically counted as a weapon back then. Unless it's written in a book.

Those 138k bitcoins must be on the blockchain somewhere. They could prove ownership by signing with the(ir) private key(s).

You can check  if your email address is included in any recent known database breaches. It's good to check every now and then anyway. Maybe you're reusing your password across a couple of different websites, with the same password on your BTC.com wallet?

"Co-signing disabled" means there may have been someone else logging into your wallet account, which triggered the disable.
A BTC.com wallet consists of 3 private keys, two (the majority) of which the user owns, and one key from BTC.com. This setup is called a 2-of-3 multisig.
To make a transaction, two out of three privkey signatures are necessary to authorize a transaction.
If you are transacting through the wallet, you sign with one of your keys and BTC.com is co-signing with their key. You could also use the recovery process where you use both two of your own keys to craft the transaction - then BTC.com doesn't need to cosign at all.

On the upside, the transaction most likely confirmed immediately on the next block.

It's not the best article about it, but this guy foreclosed a BoA a while back. I think it could've been avoided, BoA was just a lazy fuck and didn't reply to letters or show up at court. So the guy got the sheriff and Tilly Tap'd the branch.

A little late to the party, BTC.com for example already added this feature months ago.

You're not alone. I'm no newbie, but Bitcoin is getting hit hard by weird people with weird goals. In times like this it is important to decide for yourself what you believe is right.. and where the fear mongering comes from. 
To anyone reading this, hold your Bitcoin in cold storage, like a paper wallet or maybe a wallet-only android phone. Wait for the storm to blow over. All will be fine, I am sure of it.

But they were &gt;2MB with witness data.

Then you're saying Bitcoin as Satoshi envisioned it is fundamentally broken.

I wouldn't say just because someone does not understand economics, especially inflation, that this make the person "not smart".

Hm, well at least you're aware that both consume more traffic. I am still opposed to segwit. I always wonder what will happen if after segwit, blocks and witness space are full again.

I also have the exact same bill from my great-grandpa. He had racks of inflated fiat in a metal box hidden in a wall, but his farm burned down and the box was found by workers in the rubble.. now I have the box.
I think he stored it thinking it would be "real" millions one day.

Well miners get to decide, together with the community. BCH showed us that a chain needs hashpower to stay relevant. BCH is losing its hashpower --&gt; not good for the coin.

They eat babies, hurt women and tell racist jokes at @_date: 2017-06-20 00:21:23


Hmmm... So every block is gonna be ~7.9 MB including witness data?


How so? If most miners mine on one fork, then the minority which is mining the other chain eventually has to jump over, as they are losing out while mining the minority chain.


I actually would agree, but its overwhelming for the short period of time it's around.


Or if 2% disagree, they can mine that other chainhead as well, but where do they sell the coins from that chain?


Again, if only 2% or 4% disagree, they have to follow suit or just get left behind. There might be another split chain, but is it the most used, most functional, most backed by hashrate, most traded upon chain?   
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:09:21
