His name was Jesse, btw.  And he ultimately killed himself in a hotel coat room.

Absolutely no question that the sentiment is drastically different than that of what it was at the time of this survey.  The Hearn announcement, discord over direction, etc. has produced a much more healthy environment.  'Healthy' in terms of cratering the almost euphoric bullish sentiment levels that once existed.  Analogous to situations (kind of like the current stock market) where market participants will say, 'we needed a healthy correction before moving back up'.  
I don't think we're there yet.  Not enough fear.  Probably need a few more negative circumstances to arrive (like a high profile venture to fail, true mass trepidation of the future of the coin, etc.) to create the desired environment.  
Right now there's way too much complacency for a real rally.  I see no fear by people in buying at these levels, which is not what you want to see.  I get the sense of (like the many posts we all saw when Hearn left), 'Ahh, bitcoin's been declared dead so many times.... we'll be fine'.  You need less of that, and wayyyyy more of, 'Fuck this!  I'm done, this going nowhere!  I'm out', and prices matching that sentiment.  
Just my two bits, but I think you need to see some true capitulation before you get the next real move higher that everyone's been waiting for.

In all seriousness, this should have been Exhibit A as to why there wasn't going to be any appreciable move in Bitcoin (the universe never allows that many assholes to all get rich at the same time).  Be interesting to see a similar study/questionaire done now, and see if there's some more bearish responses (which, I would say is what you need before a next leg up).
