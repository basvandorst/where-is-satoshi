bitcoin seems to have been invented purely to foil any attempts to reassert sanity in this regard.

A reasonable limit to the power any individual or private entity can have in our society isn't in any way unreasonable. Crypto currency makes that harder to manage while people value it.

Good luck cashing out.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:55:45
lol right, that's what we need, an economy with even fewer ways to prevent people from accumulating too much. Let's just *entrench* the shit out of that upper class.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:51:53
Here I was hoping for a healthy dose of reality, but you just *had* to go and tie it up with a happy ending for the people who didn't sell.

"This currency could be used more effectively for crime and corruption than any before it in history"
"B-b-but nobody's using it for that *now*, so everything will therefore be fine forever!"

Leave it to a culture built on avarice to idolize better ways to enable it.

You may be confusing chaos with freedom.

Yes, you need the government to regulate the rich, but as long as you have a rich class, they'll use the government like a tool to further their own interests.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:09:28
Not the people who control it now.
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:09:15
These stooges? No, of course not.
But rest assured, they will find ways. If it even holds value when people try to use it, that is.
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:32:30
It's almost like there are purposes an economy should serve.
Purposes it can't fulfill without control and planning.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:56:00
They're doing the exact opposite of regulating the internet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:17:34
Of course not. All hot air, no substance.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:08:48
No, power concentrates. 7 billion governments becomes 500 dictatorships. Millions die as we descend into warlordism, or worse, fully-automated neo feudalism. You want a better world? Figure out how to adjust the system so that the bad guys aren't left to their own devices, and can't prosper.
Never mind that seven billion governments would be completely aimless even if it were sustainable. You can kiss your space programs goodbye.
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:08:11
You'd rapidly have a million new governments run by dictatorial assholes. Like what's happened with our economy.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:09:52
People like you are so laughably transparent. You're not _thinking_, you're just grasping at anything that'll make you feel like you have an edge on everybody else, and because you're actually no different from the least common denominator, you picked the ideology that caters to your own selfish, childish desires to be free of rules and obligations to others.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:08:36
So basically you're like those gated community-dwelling shutins who think there are muggers around every corner, except you imagine police officers and IRS investigators instead. You're afraid of all the wrong people.
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:40:49
Oh look, another guy who thinks autocracy is communism.
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:41:20
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:24:51
You too, man, you too.
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:41:54
Oh, you're one of *those* hatfuckers. Carry on.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:32:20
You can't claim to respect the rights of others and then in the same breath advocate doing away with the only institutions that will ever be able to protect them.
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:38:08
It'll be great! We can have a grown-up discussion about how to proceed into the future instead of having to listen to your incessant misattribution of the natural failings of capitalism to the concept of government.

Nonsense. The purpose of the war is to end recreational use of a variety of substances. The war has categorically failed in this regard, if only because the people running it consistently fail to realize the mental gymnastics people are capable of performing in order to justify even a purely nonaddictive habit.
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:45:07
The people selling the drugs are.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:17:21
Frankly I see little reason for it to continue in the manner that it has, and I think it was poorly executed from the start.
