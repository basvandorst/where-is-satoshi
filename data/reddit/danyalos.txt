No estoy seguro si es lo que yo necesito, por eso pregunto.
En mi restaurante cuando entrego la cuenta a los bitcoiners, sucede que quieren separar la cuenta entre varios. ¿Serviría tu app para este caso?

Ok. I got it right, now.
I suppose it works the same for 2 or more persons. 
Another question: Do the users need to have a Coinbase account in order to use the app?

We did it!
It was fun. We got all caught on video.
I will post it here later.

I live here in Buenos Aires. Maybe we can do it tomorrow. Find me on facebook for instant communication via messenger.
My idea is: Pick up a random guy or girl on the street and tell him/her that a folk from USA want tu give him a free sandwich at Subway paying with Bitcoin. And record the whole scene on video.
If any other want to join the experiment, just contact me.
 on TW or FB.

But, only the one paying for 100% of the bill, not the others, right?

Not true in every case. 
I am not a programmer, I just decided to accept BTC at my restaurant and did it without asking permission to anyone. 
I earn much of my bitcoins. Rarely buy.

I mean pay a formal advertisement sing on the field. As the likis of Coca Cola or VISA.

I don´t really know how much would it cost, but I guess it must be in the order of several millons dollars. Nothing that the global bitcoin comunity can´t afford.

I am the manager of the restaurant that  mentioned. And I'm proud of being a client of Buena Tierra. Their products are great and it was a good new they accept bitcoins. We also do it in our restaurant, so we are slowly creating our own bitcoin commerce network.
