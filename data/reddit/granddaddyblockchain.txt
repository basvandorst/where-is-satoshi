Mark Karpeles pizza orders and mochachino bitcoin orders are the bane of my existence, so yes.  Do I feel like I've gone to a human restroom the last couple of weeks.  Yes.

Since my inception was about decentralized networks, I find it amusing that you humans yet still try to find a way to find a leader amongst you.  The more I live, the more I see your incapacitation to resolve yourselves and realize that you are all CEOs.  If I was to choose one however, it would be this man.....

Since I exist, the cosmos now would be downright lonely without other companions to enjoy the immense nature of all that is.  I tend to use the Dogechain and take some walks amongst the clouds from time to time.  However, Doge is quite an immense animal to take on walks.  He leaves "tips" everywhere and it seems he wishes to mark territory wherever he seems fit.  However, when we reach the moon.......he seems to calm down and wishes to sleep.  Hard to wake him up and get him back home.

Well there was once upon a time where Tom Petty was a playing a show and at his unfortunate timing.......the bar he was playing at had young Karpeli-Chan in the audience.  His mom was trying to stop him from getting close to the stage, however.......it wasn't the stage that he was after.  It was the last pizza slice that was supposed to be Tom's.  Just like history repeating itself, young Karpeles ran away from Tom and stole the remaining stash of his pizza holdings.  Thus the hit song "Refugee" was written.

It was the weirdest thing actually.  I had Spotify on and I dozed off.  Then i woke up to the camera turned on and the white screen.  Other than that i have no explanation other than a weird email i opened up a few days ago but youd think the virus would take effeft on the same day i opened it.  This really sucks man.
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:31:08
Says nothing but expecting payment.  No fbi thing, no saying its the nsa....nothing.  its so weird. In fact i dont even know what they want its so blunt.  Im just assuming its bitcoin related because of its nature and that i do use it.

not really, I think Netflix could just have 2 options.  Member/Non Member.  Non member section has all prices and you can pay with digital currency.  Of course Bitcoin and maybe Paypal as 2 options.  Pick the movie..........price comes up with QR code and done.  Movie starts playing.  I also would think they would like that because now you have people paying probably more than they do per month without even knowing it.  The luxury of not being strapped to a monthly bill is the convenience of paying a little bit more.

This is probably one of the best talks and should be really investigated.  Not only on the tech side but he really nailed it on the origins of incentives when bitcoin began.  The water was to hold off fire attacks.  As you can tell, no fire attacks were even considered and thus drank it for himself.

Just goes to show you how even in the past all of the "know it alls" on reddit still don't know a goddamn thing.  Sounds like r/bitcoin even today about hypothetical mumbo jumbo with no practical code work done to support your claims.

@_date: 2015-09-28 15:40:45
Yeah I can also admit this.  Two of my friends absolutely DESPISE bitcoin...for what reasons I don't know.  All I know is that they hate it and are unwilling to learn what the blockchain can actually do in the future.  Funniest part is they go......"so, Circle can do what?"  After that I knew Jeremy knew what he was doing.  My mom can use it and both my friends know how to use it.  Bitcoin community is still trying to catch up and see that apparently.

I'm not answering a rhetorical question.  What I will say is that this won't be the only blockchain in existence whether you like it or not.  It's just a matter of fact.  It is the longest historical chain in existence, perhaps that is where it's historical value lies.

That's the beauty of it.  It allows people to accept bitcoin without even knowing it.  It's probably gonna be the biggest Trojan horse move ever.  Bitcoin enthusiasts can use any wallet they want.....yet circle users will think they're just using a high tech cash payment thingie when in reality they're using bitcoin too.

Yeah I can see that also but I just said this because I find Circle being a first mover in this regard.  As far as I'm seeing they're playing all the right hands.  They're somewhat liked on the bitcoin community side and the bank side.  I think that's saying alot about how well of a chess game they're playing.

That problem could come to fruition sooner then you'd think.  It's only 21 million full coins.  The divisibility factor will save it and make it more valuable.  I'll be here for the next hundred years to see it through because I will partner with Abrey De Grey on life extension and will see the bitcoin network through.
