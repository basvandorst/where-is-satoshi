3 months before the havling, miners continue to add more computing power to the network. It's an interesting fact

everyone goes to blockchain.info to check their pending txs or to use it as a blockchain explorer but the website hasnt been updated in ages and some newcomers have much better UX and features like

Bitcoind makes the necessary checks before letting the transaction in its pool but once it's in, it only removes it if the tx hash is found in a block or if its fee-per-kb is below the mempool min fee. 
We found that if you increase the RAM dedicated to your mempool on your node, it gets filled with transactions with invalid inputs. This explain how you can get a 150Mb mempool :)

Thanks for the feedback! It has been fixed now :)

yep it has now been fixed, thanks for the heads up

the price need to get significantly higher to make mining still profitable for a lot of miner. The increase has been very very steep recently:

just fixed it, thanks for the feedback :)

have you tried kaiko? 
@_date: 2015-12-21 22:37:48
nope but is this kind of data publicly available?
On a similar but different topic, I was surprise to see that the block distribution among the pools remained quite the same over the last month according to the stacked area chart here: 
I would have expected some pools to stand out with such an increase in the difficulty

Thanks a lot! Such feedbacks are always greatly appreciated!

The assets chart is very interesting indeed. Open Asset is much smaller than what I expected

Miners have different strategies regarding how they sell their bitcoins or reward their miners. Some of them keep their btc for a long time:
- bitfury keeps its btc a very longtime as seen here with one of their address with 1.8M+ worth of USD: 
- AntPool dumps everything very often (~ every $100k-200k):
- F2Pool empties its wallets only once in a while (they can have up to $1.5M on their wallets before dumping everything):
- BTCC didnt dump anything before getting ~$4M:

not sure, but still you'd need a substantial amount of bitcoin to reach this level of transaction volume otherwise the fees would consume everything.
Unless youre a miner of course...

sure but with a total of 4.67BTC in the blocks, i'ts less than 1/1000 of the block's total. The block has ~1500 txs in it so it is not way out of line. This transaction doesnt account for 80% of the block's fees, which is exactly my point
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:07:29
this is the trading volume. You can move you bitcoin back and forth which increases the daily volume

I investigated a bit and the block with the highest fees for yesterday is this one: 
Its fees are around 4.7BTC while the total for the day is around 92 BTCs.  So apparently, it looks like it is due to a large number of txs with higher fees rather than a few one with exceptionally large fees.
@_date: 2016-03-04 08:19:44
If the fees of the largest block are 4.7BTC and the total for the day is 92BTC, with a total of around 140 blocks a day, it means that the fees are almost evenly distributed among the others blocks.
So this proved that there is not a single block accounting for the spike. Now, when looking at the fees distribution in the block, it is clear, that no transaction accounts for 80% of the block's fees.
Again, this proves that at least on this particular day, fees where much higher for a large number of txs and not an isolated ones as you seem to think
@_date: 2016-01-06 18:49:46
it's equivalent to the total bitcoin transaction volume
@_date: 2016-03-03 16:54:22
Yesterday's fees per kB were 0.65 mBtc/kB which is more than twice the weekly averages of the past months

The only risk of talking about this today is to drive the price up today, which is not that harmful these days...
