- Bitmessage nodes store the encrypted messages only for two days before erasing them, therefore, messages are not archived in the network. New nodes joining the network can only download and broadcast the pool messages from the last two days. Any messages which have not received an acknowledgement of being received, can be re-sent by the originator of the message after the two-day period.
- This is not our target demographic

We understand, and would like to have a fall back position if network rules with MS change.  But yes, we plan to make use of that method and others.

The point being, its going to happen anyway. The demographic of tweetbit.org's market is not data storage, but the right to freedom of speech without censorship.

Few of us want bloat, but the potential value added to the global society relative to the cost to the network, is minimal.

Thank you so much.  We agree.  We think decentralized content is the next big thing with blockchain technology.

Mining was once open to anyone.  We feel the same is inevitable with those that host a full node.  Our pricing is currently set to detract spam, and we are working on larger data/cost solutions along with methods to reduce/prevent duplicate content. 
Bloat is a negative impact to those in a first world country.  Our demographic is the rest of the world.

Here's a guide for a windows user new to linux, but this is overkill.
I would just load bitaddress.org, and kill your connection, print, and reboot.

Hello 1blockologist,
If your concern is "bloat", a partial answer, is that we feel advancements in data storage compression algorithms will render existing models obsolete.  
Additionally as we have seen mining become more specialized over time, we believe the same holds true for full nodes.
Thanks, for the link to Storj, We'll check out their recently published whitepaper.

Couldn't you just have a requirement for nodes to validate at random intervals by a websocket like request from other nodes?
Ie, to be a "rated" node, you have to be able to prove to other nodes that you run a full node.  Additionally you have to be able to check others.
To do so, you request the hash for a random set of recent blocks, and a time frame for a response, ie before next block.  The response is validated.
Each node keeps a list of nodes that are "trustworthy", based on the above method.
The list builds a "credit rating" for each node
Above some rating, you get a small reward per block
Make sense?

The context of my reply, was that a government looking to take down bitcoin, would need to compete.  The average Joe, want's to hear that bitcoin is backed by something they understand, like their current money.  So wild claims, are required to create the illusion of a coin superior to an open source decentralized competitor like bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:20:56
Why not just create a MS hot wallet, where multiple exchange servers are required to process transactions?  Ie, multiple devices would need to be hacked.

Bitcoin is a unique digital object, similar to how gold is limited and unique.  The ownership of bitcoin is stored in a public ledger call the block chain.  
Can you clarify what else you are confused by?  I'll try to help.

Why does one need a user/pass for this site?

Basically just use a bitcoin address as a username, and then sign a message with that address as password verification.

An application server failure, would have user feed back, correct?  I mean, you would know there is a problem right away, and could shut things down.

As crazy as it may sound, this stuff is still very new.  Plus many people have emotional attachments to money, and this represents change with money.  Most people need time.  Give it 10 years, just like the internet itself.

Create alt-coin, pre-mine, and claim the coin is backed by the government.  Make wild claims, and destroy the competition.

Something as simple as this would work....remember, you can be your own bank, just do it yourself:
[Look here for more details](
     while true:
           if Now() &gt; NextPaymentDate:
                rawtxn = r.createrawtransaction(inputs,outputs)
                signtxn = r.signrawtransaction(rawtxn)
                r.sendrawtransaction(signtxn['hex'])
                NextPaymentDate = NextPaymentDate + period
          sleep(60*60*2)  every 2 hours
