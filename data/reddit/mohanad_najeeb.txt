Mycelium on Android
Breadwallet on iOS/Android

I think that would be a good move since aliexpress/alipay have no plans to accept bitcoin anytime soon.

I think  is what you guys are looking for.
They offer buying with credit cards and when you want to take it to the next level they offer trading as well.
Plus you can withdraw to a credit card for $3.6 fee.

Breadwallet is great app even if they support BIP75 it's up to the user to share his/her personal information with any 3rd party.
I just don't see the problem...

It's against the law in egypt (and everywhere else in the world) to run an unlicensed money transmitting business.
From what I'm understanding trading bitcoin is not the reason for his arrest it's accepting USD for it which is illegal in egypt.

It's over guys

WOW! $6,000 investment to make less than $20 a day!
plus your hardware is useless when the difficulty increases.
 
o_O remind me again why do people mine bitcoin?

since bitcoin transactions are not reversible you can not buy bitcoin using a reversible payment method.
The risk is just too high that's why services like coinmama charge so much.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:52:29
The sad truth I realised recently is the fact that bitcoin is only accessible to the people who already have access to other payment methods.

Well, It's not Paypal it's the US government.

one time someone send me a transaction with almost no fees at all, first confirmation was 2 days later.
relax I don't think they can double spend with circle!
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:51:10
How about 
@_date: 2016-07-25 21:59:42
yes, thats why **I lost money on a shitty deal, bitched about it on reddit and trolled people commenting on my bitching**
@_date: 2016-07-21 22:18:54
That's actually very impressive.
Thanks for the correction :)
@_date: 2016-07-20 16:13:55
Open a  account then use  or any of their supported exchanges.
@_date: 2016-07-24 21:58:58
Try Mycelium Gear if you want to accept and get bitcoin.
To accept bitcoin and get fiat I would go with bitpay.

No international transfers! Only limited to europe (which is not too bad)
I recomend  for SEPA -&gt; BTC or BTC -&gt; SEPA

I used to like ethereum but the hard fork was a big disappointment to me.
@_date: 2016-07-25 12:15:53
They should've just accepted the bitcoin and used it to fund their account or even better HODL it.
@_date: 2016-07-21 22:21:43
Any chance of giving the user the option to choose denomination?
*BTC instead of Bits*

I have used cex.io for while I can confirm they are 100% legit.
The exchange UI is too flashy for my taste buy the app is excellent.
Tip: You can trade ETH/BTC on cex.io with no fees.

*Buy now &amp; HODL*
Bottom line.. it's never too late to buy.
@_date: 2016-07-25 12:07:31
No your money will not disappear the transaction will get confirmed or dropped from the pool.
Double spend it with fees this time and you should be good.
Tip: always include a decent fee use and this  to determine the right amount.
