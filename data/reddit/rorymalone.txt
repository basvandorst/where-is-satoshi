Missing 'Canoe'= 0.69%

As far as I can tell:
* Nothing immediately - though some miners will also start signaling BIP141 
* The block period continues until the end of the 336 blocks (~11pm GMT/UTC 20th July)
There is then one further 336 block period:
* Miners should start signaling using SegWit on bit 1 (BIP141)
* Miners will start running the final btc1 code (due for release Friday 21st July)
At the end of that block period:
* Miners should start rejecting any blocks that are not signaling SegWit with bit 1
* This will have the effect of pushing BIP141/SegWit up to the required 95% lock-in level

And they are one of the miners signaling both BIP91 (SegWit2x) and BIP141 (SegWit itself) at the moment, so no further waiting for them to update again during the next SegWit signaling period...

Got you - so SegWit will most likely achieve 95% during the present SegWit2x 'grace period' of 336 blocks....
...but SegWit itself requires 95% of a much longer period - 2016 blocks - to lock in itself.

For the first time, over 80% of the last 144 blocks have been signaling BIP91 - just now.
Lock-in may happen this period, definitely by the next period (starts Friday) once Slush, BitFury and F2Pool start signalling. They had better get their skates on if the lock-in happens before they start signaling BIP91!!

Aren't they technically right?
Once BIP91's locked in, you don't need to signal BIP91 anymore, just BIP141 (SegWit).

Woop woop! Finally!

Bitcoin.com is now signaling Bit1 (BIP141)
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:56:57
BTC.com is now signaling SegWit at Bit 1 too (but not SegWit2x, anymore)
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:58:14
So is BTC.com
@_date: 2017-07-20 11:42:38
4.17% - my typo
@_date: 2017-07-20 11:22:31
 - with dark mode turned on (top left lightbulb)
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:30:05
F2Pool are now signaling SegWit2x and Segwit too, now.
