Meh, seems like a reasonable critique. If anything it sounds like she might be in favor of an ETF.

I don't know, being able to turn £6 million into USD anonymously, quickly, and with almost no fees seems pretty useful to me.
EDIT exchange rates

Every time it tanks and doesn't hit 0 it becomes stronger and since it's almost impossible for it to hit 0 because of it's usefulness in moving currency around internationally odds are it has a bright future even though it's still correcting from the massive bubble.

It's your only option for moving money outside the country if the govt controls the banks.

Yes, this is the correct meme.

Risk is relative, compared to bonds? Yes it's risky. Compared to publicly traded stocks, probably not much different. Like buying any publicly traded stock, it comes down to do you believe in the potential of this company/technology, at which point I like to focus on the benefits of crypto. I then tell people that if they do believe that crypto has long term potential now is the best time to invest because the price is as stable as it's been in ages and, relative to it's potential to become a new global currency, it is dirt cheap. When most people bawk at that, I tell them that it's a pandora's box scenario. Now that this technology is out there, there is almost nothing that any 1 person, government, or group of people can do to fully kill it, and it's potential is only bounded by its utilization. So unlike publicly traded companies, there is a much lower risk of bitcoin "going bankrupt" so to speak.

Bitcoin isn't illegal, nothing about the transaction I described is illegal. It's not the exchange rate, it's the international banking fees, it's getting taxed on it, all of that you can avoid using Bitcoin.

Confidence levels are a thing though, and they increase with more data.

It doesn't matter how big Bitcoins enemies are, it's a hyda that they have no way to kill because it's decentralized and the longer it survives the more valuable it becomes.

Right, the point, as many have pointed out, is no investment that will yield returns has 0 risk. Comparatively, most government bonds tend to be more stable than individual stocks, that's why they're used to balance risk in most portfolios. The real question that people need to ask themselves is, do you think crypto is the future of currency or is it just a fad? I personally think that even if BTC doesn't become a global standard, crypto is not going away, you can't uncreate the concept of blockchain just like you can't uncreate the concept of weaponized nuclear fusion,  and if it ends up being a superior way of conducting commerce than it will eventually become the global standard.

We have data from before and after tether existed so yes. The good thing about confidence intervals is they're never going to be 100% accurate, it's a way of determining probability.

So let's say my rich grandmother in London has died and I've inherited £6 million and I want to transfer it to USD for as small a fee as possible. Or maybe I run a business in a country with an unstable government that controls the banking system and need to get my cash out of the country before I flee for my life. There are a million reasons why you would want to anonymously move YOUR money around the world without having gotten it by shady means.
This site gives some good info about how to buy BTC anonymously
tl;dr: There's  Visa gift cards, and Bitcoin ATMs all over the world. 
Now you're in the USA and you want your money. You can keep it in BTC and use it as a savings acct, or find a bulk buyer, or make a bunch of small transactions over a few days, there are plenty of options. If you do find a bulk buyer, $6 million in cash isn't as big as you think it is, you could fit it in a medium sized duffel bag. Also cash counting machines are a thing so no goons needed. 
I'm sorry you have so much hate for a technology that has a ton of beneficial applications in the world of finance, but like most disruptive technologies there are people on both sides who either love it or hate it.

You know what I meant

I don't doubt it but I haven't heard a lot of examples. For this example specifically, I think libertarians and SJWs actually see eye to eye on the value of crypto but they're so busy shit talking each other for wanting basically the same thing (personal freedom and equal opportunities) but having different ideas of how to get there that they can't acknowledge their own common ground.

Well if your national or local government is organized, accountable, and truly representative then it should also live in service to everyone.

This will surely be the nail in the coffin for bitcoin ^/s

If he's an anarchist he wouldnt use Twitter. If there are examples or articles out there I'd love to see them, I know tons of self described SJWs and they all think Bitcoin is great since our current banking system is riddled with inequities.
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:27:59
Actually, that guy seems pretty right leaning if you look at his history. Thinking Bitcoin will create inequality =/= SJW.
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:33:39
I've never heard of 'SJW's' complain about wealth or gender inequality in bitcoin, but I can see how a libertarian would imagine that.

If it was for women it would be called bitchcoin amiright?! ^/s
