Yes, people do this, but it's mostly useless.  Last year, the landlord decided not to renew the lease on the place I was renting, and I had to move.  I tried to switch my address to a PO box while I was looking for a new place, but I got some grief from insurance and credit card companies over it.  The reality is, people often have completely innocent reasons for having moved to a new address or using a PO box, and investigating such cases ends up being a waste of time.

No, the California bill is much worse.
In New York, the restrictions on conversion or exchange are limited.  Since only money transmitters are regulated under the banking law, this only applies to conversion or exchange as part of an existing money transmission business.
California proposes to ban ANY buying or selling of bitcoins, regardless of whether it's for money transmission, speculation, investment, or other purpose.  This includes localbitcoins, craigslist, etc.  AB 1326 is a nearly complete ban on bitcoin trading.

You seem to be implying that OP is doing something illegal.  This does not appear to be the case.
Pennsylvania's money transmitter law is less strict than some other states and doesn't apply to bitcoin.  Moreover, federal regulations on money transmission only refer to transmitting money to another person or another location.  A bitcoin-for-cash exchange, in person, at the same location, is permissible.
So as far as I can tell, this is completely legal.

tldr: Bitcoin costs society less than a penny per transaction.

I was referring to the proposed regulations, which can be found here: 
The regulations cite the financial services law as the statutory authority.  You can look it up at the state government website.  The Financial Services Law (FIS) gives NYDFS authority to enforce the banking and insurance laws.  There are several relevant sections of the banking law, which define what types of companies are regulated. Article 3 is banks, and 13-B is money transmitters. That'd be a good place to start.
@_date: 2014-01-06 06:25:48


Basically if the IRS thinks a foreign bank has customers who are U.S. persons that might be avoiding taxes, the bank gets taxed instead.  But the bank can only be taxed if they have assets in the United States (eg US dollars).  So the foreign bank cannot hold USD, and you cannot transfer dollars between your US bank account and a foreign bank account.  This is where bitcoin comes in.
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:14:07

Even if he is allowed to do it, he didn't follow proper procedure regarding the job impact analysis.  And it's about how it specifically affects your business and whether you have standing to sue.

You're missing the point.  The question was about state law, not federal law.

@_date: 2014-03-01 18:36:53
Just buying and selling bitcoins generally is legal, although it is subject to the same laws as selling anything else, such as paying taxes, etc.
If you are sending money to third parties, you may be considered a money transmitter.
If you are holding customer funds (like Mt Gox did) then you may be subject to the rules for depository institutions (ie a bank).  This is why Coinbase doesn't hold customers' funds.
State money transmitter laws vary.  In Pennsylvania, for example, the money transmitter law only covers payment instruments like money orders, but in Florida just about any form of money transmission is restricted.
This is all very complicated, and you need a lawyer if you're planning to start a business.

Yes, I have read the complaint against Shrem.  He had some customers who were probably buying drugs.  The money laundering law that he is charged with violating is generally applied to people with direct involvement in running drug cartels.  Applying this to recreational drug users is a stretch.

@_date: 2014-07-23 16:10:20
It's not clear what part of the regulations you're challenging.  It might be worthwhile to start with 200.2(n)(3) and (4).  Merely buying or selling bitcoin does not appear to fit into any of the definitions of banking services or money transmission in the banking law.
NYDFS only has authority to regulate persons subject to the banking and insurance laws, and I don't see how trading bitcoin fits into article 3 section 96 et seq, or article 13-B of the banking law.

No, it's not quite that strict.  The definition of "Currency exchange" means exchanging the money of one government for money of another government.  So it doesn't include bitcoin-for-cash exchanges.

No, I think you misunderstood.  Blocks being full, leads to users going elsewhere, which leads to blocks not being full, and, at the same time, a price drop.
@_date: 2016-02-07 17:17:42
A contentious hard fork is likely, and unsurprisingly the price has been declining.  The price decline is not due to speculators though.  Speculators are buying.  Regular users aren't.  Blocks are full, transactions get stuck, so people use alternative payment methods and buy less bitcoin.  The only thing that has prevented a large drop is that speculators have been buying, in hopes of selling at a profit once this all gets resolved.
The miners bickering over the blocksize increase was clearly against their own interests.  It appears they are slowly starting to realize this.
@_date: 2016-02-07 17:27:39
If the price drops and miners start losing money, things will change very quickly.  Miners won't continue to act against their own interests once it starts costing them a lot of money.
@_date: 2016-02-08 02:55:09

BitPay's fees are a lot less than PayPal's.

Paypal is not difficult to use?  Well, it can be.
It wasn't that hard to get started.  Had to click through a bunch of things and it took awhile, but I got it eventually.
Then a few months later I tried to use it again.  Well my account was inactive for too long so it wouldn't let me send any money until I answered the security questions.  Good thing I wrote down the answers because I wouldn't have remembered what I picked as my favorite restaurant.
Then a few months later someone tries to send me money.  I log into my paypal account....no money. Check my email and there's a notice from paypal that I received money.  Says I need to confirm my email address.  So I do that.  Still no money.  What's going on?  Then a few minutes later the money shows up in my paypal account.
Paypal can be a real pain sometimes.

They're waiting to see how many of those "high-risk" transactions actually get reported as fraudulent.

No, SHA256 doesn't use floating point operations.  The supposed petaflops is a completely made-up number.

Some people are poor because they're stupid.  Lottery winners going broke are a perfect example of this.
Here's one example:

For $2000, it's cheaper to find someone who will do cash in the mail.  Overnight mail is $20 in the US and $35 to Canada (canadianbitcoins.com will accept USD)

I ordered something thru bitsumo.  They emailed me a link to a bitpay invoice a few hours later.  I paid it, and Bitsumo placed the order with the vendor within 24 hours.  The vendor actually shipped the package a few days later.

I'm not sure where he's going with this - but I'm guessing that the feds have evidence against Ulbricht that they don't want to reveal.
Three people allegedly associated with Silk Road have been arrested, but the others have set up a new site selling the same stuff, and those people are very keen to find out how the feds got the original Silk Road server.  The feds don't want to reveal that, but they might have to if the Ulbricht case goes to trial.
So possibly this is a test case to see if the feds will show their hand.

[Bitsumo]( has a different fee schedule which can cost less for expensive items.  Also, if you want to order from Amazon, it may be cheaper to buy an amazon gift card from gyft.com and order from amazon directly.
