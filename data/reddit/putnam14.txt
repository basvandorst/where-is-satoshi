Well it’s a logarithmic scale and arguably the best way to present trends like this. Using a linear scale, 40% declines a year ago would look like nothing on the graph.

I don’t think there is any institutional threat regarding Coinbase, but I’d rather have hold of my own keys for a multitude of reasons. I prefer to have access to any forks and hold my coins in a Segwit address. I also prefer to have my coins protected by a long passphrase rather than a password. Exchanges have been hacked, and sure they might be insured but do you know how long he claims process might be?
I don’t understand what you mean by the stolen part though. Buy a Ledger and store the paper you write the passphrase on in a bank vault.

I don’t think anyone on here is trying to skirt the IRS, Bitcoin has gone beyond being solely used for criminal activities.
The idea behind holding your own keys is that you can move/sell it on any exhale whenever you want, as well as having access to any forks or using a Segwit address. I had my bitcoin on Coinbase during the BCH fork, I wish I had moved it off so I could claim BCH sooner. Holding my own bitcoin allowed me to cash in my Bitcoin Gold as well.
One difference between TD and Coinbase is that TD doesn’t go down or halt trading during massive price movements. Coinbase does. If I had wanted to sell back when trading was suspended during the BCH split I would have been SOL. Holding my own coins I could have sent them to Bittrex or Binance or wherever and panic sold them.

Did you not generate a seed for your paper wallets? What happens if they're lost in a fire, or you need access to your bitcoin when you don't have them in your possession?

Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Bitcoin futures contracts. Some people are paranoid that institutional investors are pumping up the price and then will sell, taking advantage of having bought contracts which they can sell for even more fiat. However, remember that pump and dumps are illegal and the conspiracy probably isn't true, so you should just hodl.

Gold does not derive its value from its commercial applications. Gold has value as people view it as a store of value and ability to be split into small portions. It's rare enough with a limited supply, and the demand for it as a store of value drives the price. Bitcoin is exactly like gold in this regard. Limited supply that can be infinitely divided being used as a store of value.

The CFTC is a federal agency, so they have the power to take corporations to court. Penalties would depend on the court proceedings. I'm not saying that it's guaranteed that if a institutional investor were to be manipulating the commodity they'd be penalized, [it's not]( but I don't think Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Merrill Lynch want to get caught up in something like this.

When bitcoin futures go live on the CME then the CFTC (similar to the SEC, but for futures contracts) will have regulatory control over bitcoin futures. Big banks have gotten away with worse, but I would wager a bet (in the form of investing in bitcoin) that if any one were to make a few billion off of bitcoin price manipulation then the CFTC would launch an investigation.

Speculation in the stock market certainly exists, but investing in a general sense is not speculation. I could invest in a broad-market ETF and open myself up to risk, however there has been a positive yield over the past 25 years, in addition to scheduled dividend payments. You could also invest into a bond ETF, or buy T bills, where there is near no risk involved.

You're young, you don't have to be extremely risk averse. Once you start working full time and get 401k matches and such, max those out. Allocate the rest of what you want to be saving to equity (SPY, the S&amp;P500 ETF), micro loans, Bitcoin, etc. Don't bother with bonds or gold until you're in your 30s.
The best thing you could do right now, financially, is to read "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" cover to cover and take notes.

The tx fee on a $4,000 sell on Coinbase is under $60. I'm not aware of any additional withdrawal fees, so there really isn't too much transaction cost to this. Also number one rule of speculation: don't gamble what you can't afford to lose.

Is the 850k BTC claims converted to USD/fiat based on the price in early 2014? So $550ish? That means hey would have owed around $500m, 60k coins at or above $10,000 today is $600m... So are they not going to sell anymore and disburse the rest?

A stop loss of mine triggered when it hit 6,000 last night, so you all can expect the price to go up today.

No. BTC in a futures market would be the most likely way somebody with a lot of cash would be able to manipulate it, putting a lot of downward pressure on it. ETFs also are designed to issue more shares than it owns, which is the point of an ETF really. There's the underlying commodity which is held in a fund and then however many shares are issued tend to match the value of the fund. The market cap would ideally move in tandem with BTC's price. Adding more shares would only make the price per share go down, as outstanding shares is public information. Any sort of manipulation would quickly be met with arbitrage from automated trading platforms.

That's fair enough, and I agree it's not real retirement money. At such a young age it's enough to put into an index fund and get a steady stream of passive income that would need to be augmented by odd jobs or a career. However, with that extra security he could find a job that is satisfying without the pressure of needing to find a job that sucks your life away in exchange for cash and goods

Have you checked out Mr. Money Mustache? Not everyone has the same standards for retirement and most people can be happy and have a very fulfilling life without being ultra consumers. I'm living very comfortably right now off of $2k/month in a suburb of Seattle. On the weekends and evenings most of my time is spent outdoors and I almost never eat out. I can put up to 30% of my salary into savings. My parents raised me and my sister on 60k a year and never felt lower than mid-middle class.
