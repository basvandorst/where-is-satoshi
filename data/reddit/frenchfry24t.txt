I bought all of mine last year before the massive pump, still in the green. When you invest, you put it in what you can afford to lose.

Hey however you invest is your own business. Honestly I have 20K XRP. Then I stopped and let it do it's thing. Coulda cashed out at 60 grand but missed that boat.
You man, lol if this shit takes off you could be looking at a 9 figure payday, I wish you the best.
