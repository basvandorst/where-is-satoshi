Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!*

well what if the market order happened when the price was 1.0 but then coinbase froze everything, opened it a day later, and then executed the buy order at 2.0 of the price. isn't that kind of what happened?

it's already just a pump and dump coin. short spikes followed by a prolonged downtrend. rinse repeat. until nobody takes the bait anymore

Sure C isn't easy to program but it's stood the test of ages. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. And the documentation and resources for this language are probably unparalleled. Also Eclaire can run on modern computers without problems. Try it out again and report back to us :)

thanks. for a second I thought I was going crazy.
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:54:56
this comment pretty much reveals you had no intention on actually testing and reporting anything positive.
@_date: 2018-03-03 14:58:19
I like your math.. so when would that be?
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:55:02
Sorry you've lost your credibility when you stated C is obsolete. If you ever did any significant programming (such as in C) you would know there's not one tool that can do everything. And C is the right tool for a LOT. Probably a lot more than the languages you are thinking of being "better". Good day.

if you believe just because it's not a stock means no market rules apply then you are mistaken. whenever you sell anything you will be subject to trade laws and and consumer protection laws. take for example false advertisement laws.. you could sell someone something on craigslist but if you misrepresented the product the person could very well take you to court and win.
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:30:05


Ah, even more revealing. Honestly I don't think you've ever programmed in C. C is absolutely NOWHERE near being obsolete: 
That's like saying linux is obsolete (check your username).

is it just me or does bitcoin generally accelerate down faster than accelerate up? seems like the down goes faster whereas the climb up takes longer and lasts longer
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:04:41
yes I was assuming positive intent but then I read your comment and realized you probably didn't have positive intent re lightning.

in a true free market at some point we very well might have hyper-monopolies. a "true free market" is not a cure for all. and yes I am against over-regulations as well I guess you can call me a moderate
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:19:02
this. they actually did announce it in advance, and then didn't keep their promise

that's basically how money is made in the 21st century
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:28:03
I'm not sure why you're assuming that I am younger than you. Hypercapitalism can certainly not be described as "free" and neither can monopolies. Maybe we have different ways of trying to achieve a "free market" (we all want a free market). But in many cases libertarians want an utterly free market with no regulations whatsoever, and that I do disagree with. Not sure what you don't understand about the point I'm making and why you're acting like a like a jerk in this thread. Maybe go outside for a walk.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:29:06
Just because a government can be coercive, doesn't mean a free market can't be coercive as well. I'm against overregulation, and I'm also against hyper-capitalism. Both are wrong. Why not stand somewhere in the middle, only a Sith deals in absolutes.

I don't have too much time to respond right now but I appreciate the reasonable response. If you subscribe to a biblical worldview, as do I, you might be surprised when you read Acts where people "sold everything" and gave it to the poor. A pretty dumb thing to do, from a  capitalist perspective? You are right though, I am very much in the middle. I grew up in Germany, a far more social system compared to the US, where I live now. I can appreciate both sides.
