I’m bullish on hitting 15k this month
@_date: 2019-07-30 06:54:14
Whoooo! Finally I have been the chosen one! Thanks bags!
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:56:58
*Cough* pretty sure we saw in the 9s today *Cough*
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:25:17
What’s our timeframe
@_date: 2019-07-30 06:35:52
THIS. I love it��
Thank you for sharing this. Made my night
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:56:25
I like to live life on the edge
@_date: 2019-07-29 05:41:59
I want in on this action ��
@_date: 2019-11-13 04:27:19
You don’t own a phone though... so this guy is just gonna chill with you while you collect
@_date: 2019-11-13 04:15:31
How are you going to get your satoshis without a device connected to the internet?��
@_date: 2019-11-13 05:14:55
Got it. I’ll do some more research. Thanks man����
@_date: 2019-11-13 04:08:15
That’s what I’m trying to wrap my head around. Everyone saying “Bakkt is good for bitcoin” I see it doing the opposite. Keep in mind this is coming from limited research
@_date: 2019-11-13 04:46:28
With enough data to keep this going for hours while you constantly check Reddit and your wallet? Nice try man
@_date: 2019-11-13 07:27:04
I did some research I get it now so ignore my last comment
@_date: 2019-11-13 04:21:35
I’m all about helping people but this seems a little scammy
@_date: 2019-11-13 04:55:19
See that’s another thing that I don’t get. They could be selling air for all we know. Seems kinda schemey to keep that a secret
@_date: 2019-11-13 04:16:14
How are futures determined?
@_date: 2019-11-13 04:53:35
So whatever they come up with and if people buy it they could get potentially rekt
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:58:59
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:18:09
Dump it
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:12:20
Guys just use PEMDAS

Chinese market opens in about 15 minutes. That’s when we’ll see the real action
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:47:09
And it’s back
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:12:44
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:20:29
Btc but feel free to keep a little in the alts. Depends on the alts. I took 75% of all my alts and put it in to btc around 9k. Best decision I could have made
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:23:08
What color you getting
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:16:41
50/50 it. 50 in now 50  in when it’s higher
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:01:34
Great observation
My reddit age has nothing to do with my knowledge on crypto. Just in case you thought those two correlated
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:28:08
Yeah it’s all a shot in the dark buts it’s interesting to to see what people think. We’re all sheep and we all move in herds. So if the sheep are into bitcoin the bitcoin rises. So far we’re a small flock so we’ll see where it goes.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:27:10
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:04:14
Get itttttt
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:34:46
Also a very social activity ��
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:31:43
Bitcoin is more social and physiological  than anyone cares to admit. Same goes for the value of anything. That’s why����
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:20:07
What’s your thoughts big guy
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:44:46
I think we’ll see in the 9s this week or next. Rooting for you buddy����
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:58:38
Where’s the resistance! Holy duck ��
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:24:35
Why not
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:42:40
You’re chillin
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:21:41
Whys that?
@_date: 2019-12-08 03:19:12
Check out giving block
@_date: 2019-12-08 03:03:28
Did you hear someone recently ate it off the wall
@_date: 2019-12-07 06:21:01
...... what?
@_date: 2019-12-08 03:04:16
Hey me too!
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:03:49
Where we going today guys?
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:19:22
I traded all my ltc for btc. Just do it
@_date: 2019-12-21 19:15:55
Welcome to the bitcoin world my dude! I recommend do a little research first. The questions you just asked could be answered with a simple google search. Look up some exchanges and see what would fit you best. If you get stuck on anything we’ll be here
@_date: 2019-12-05 08:13:32
What the heck! I work for the y and I was just talking about doing this for our annual campaign. This is awesome! I’m glad to see someone else that works for the same organization got this going. Will definitely help when I pitch it for my association
@_date: 2019-09-26 05:57:39
Better buy this dip soon
@_date: 2019-09-12 06:27:18
You make money you spend it so really nothing in the grand scheme of things
@_date: 2019-09-12 06:14:26
So no cash in the bank just all crypto
@_date: 2019-09-12 06:22:41
I like your style
@_date: 2019-09-11 06:21:00
@_date: 2019-09-12 06:11:15
I’m just curious what people think. Not saying that this something I’m actually contemplating
@_date: 2019-09-12 06:20:15
Let’s make this your averagish employed single American. Has a steady job pays standard bills, no debt, makes 65k a year with 25k in their savings. Has a disposable income of about 1k a month.  
This is not me just a scenario I though of
@_date: 2019-09-12 07:47:57
Don’t worry boys. This is hypothetical
