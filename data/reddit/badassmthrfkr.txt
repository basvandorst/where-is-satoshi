It must be a very recent change because it was a regular transaction with cash back [just last week.](

This sub is a lot more sane now without all the stupid memes of "HODL", "buy the dip", "Christmas sale" shit. It was an echo chamber just a month ago with people high-fiving each other because they bought more when it dipped under 13k.

Even when it went *down* to $15k, there were memes of it being a "Christmas Sale" and of course HODL was the chant of the sub. It's fairly obvious nobody really knows what's going on, especially people who advise you to buy "the dip" as if they know.

I didn't even bother. I got in at 2k and I doubt selling 10-15% of my holding now would give me a peace of mind anyway: I'll just ride it out.

I for one bought at $2.5k and was ready to pull out if it dipped below $10k. My initial investment was the amount I could afford to lose but it grew to an amount I was uncomfortable to keep gambling with. I kept playing anyway because I kept winning but that changed the past couple of days so I drew a line where I'd walk away from the table still with massive profit. Yeah, that would have been a bad move in retrospect but hindsight is 20/20: I wouldn't have regretted it.

I think in that comparison, you have to factor for people who doesn't bother typing ".com" and just click the first result. I mean, how many people doesn't know about Amazon, Google, or Facebook and need to search for them?

Umm... no. I'll rate the app based on my personal experience, not based on what a Redditor told me to.

As if people who sold don't feel bad enough already... assholes.

it really annoys me how everybody use **** as if everybody else should know what they are talking about.

And all you need is a smartphone apparently.
