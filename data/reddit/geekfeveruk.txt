Wow, I haven't even heard of half these coins. Coinbase is set up for Ethereum so that may be a sign of strength. It's having a good run right now, and is some way off ATH so that's a reasonable target.

Great story. Last month I bought a lottery ticket, and I never thought I would win anything. Later, I checked the numbers.

That's nothing. I bought 10,000 for the price of a couple of pizzas.

Hard to say, guess it falls to  or so. Bottom line, if Bitcoin achieves even moderate success as a mainstream currency, it would be valued in line with a major corporation, at the very least. If it catches up with Apple, there's a 38 x upside, if it catches gold, it's more like 400 x. That's a stretch. But a multiple of say 20 over 5 years is surely achievable. The tough part would be hodling out through all the ups and downs.

Gold would be  valued at around 10 x Apple ($8tn ish). Silver is much closer to the market cap of BTC, and there's a good bull case for silver too. This link is out of date, but interesting:

Fair point :) There was the opportunity to compare growth / adoption with other assets or use technical analysis to show where the graph might go. At least if they showed their workings, which would inevitably turn out to be wildly inaccurate, it would provide food for thought / entertainment.

Really? Amazing. Pretty sure that loophole won't stick around too long! Until BTC reaches critical mass, it's easy for it to slip under the radar, but when I can buy a house with 1BTC, someone is going to pay attention :)

Well if 1BTC = $350k then it would be pretty stable by then, probably near enough gold levels of stability (still more volatile than a major currency). If there's any fear / doubt over the currency, that valuation would not be possible.

It's ok, the beer would have boiled in the sun anyway.

You could argue that the uncertainty over the ETF has been holding the price back. It wouldn't surprise me if the upward trend continued soon, after such resilience today. I'll say $1220 but who the F knows short term.

"we apply a more fundamental approach in this article in order to come up with a bitcoin price forecast for 2017"
That article was sorely lacking in any kind of fundamental price analysis. They dismissed what every other outlet said, including the one predicting $2000 in 2017, showed a couple of graphs demonstrating ATM rises and recent price activity, then threw up their hands and said yeah ok maybe $2000. How does their stance of "things are looking encouraging for BTC" result in their price prediction?
Bit useless really.

IMHO there are 3 likely outcomes for Bitcoin:
1. It dies quickly.
2. It dies slowly: continues to rise, perhaps "to the moon" but ultimately fails to achieve critical mass and becomes irrelevant, perhaps replaced by some other altcoin(s).
3. It succeeds in the long term, in which case because of limited supply it will have incredible value vs fiat, but also, crucially, achieve stability.
If scenario 1 happens, we're all screwed so best not to have all your eggs in the BTC basket.
If scenario 2 happens, it's a good idea to have some flexibility so when a target is reached, you can bank some profit and can look back at BTC as a fun and profitable exercise.
If scenario 3 happens, your BTC has the same stability as fiat but value is not eroded. At that point, there is no other currency worth considering so although your spending power will have increased, you won't be under pressure to sell. It would be like having a superior form of cash in the bank, and you would use it to buy things, not as an investment vehicle.
If you remember that 3 is the ultimate goal (and it may take 10 years or may never be reached), there will be no more crazy volatility, no more high risk, then YOUR ultimate goal will be to retain as much of the currency as possible until / in case it is achieved.
For this reason I think it's foolish (although of course tempting) to sell the "vast majority" of your hodling at any stage, other than to buy another non-depreciating asset like real estate. It's smart to set aside an amount, perhaps 25-30% in case of scenario 2, as insurance. But one day, we hope, BTC will be safer and just as stable / practical as a fiat currency like USD.
"Hodl" is not blind faith, it's a belief that BTC is money, and everyone likes money so why switch to toilet paper aka fiat.

It's not sketchy to report earnings to the government. It is annoying to pay tax, but that's how the system works. You'll have to pay a fair chunk of capital gains tax - most developed countries have already legislated for how to treat crypto earnings.

There is room for a few strong currencies in the world, and many weak / inflationary currencies with rapidly decreasing value. I expect the same to happen with crypto. It's not Bitcoin or nothing. Bitcoin has problems, as we all know, which will hopefully be fixed and confidence in the currency will be restored. The price is far too low, because of high fees, transaction times, and bad press / fear of fork. BTC will be like the USD of crypto, I guess, but there is also room for GBP, CHF, AUD etc. More use by more people with less inflation = confidence and value.
You don't have to go back very far to see a similar bubble, in the dot com boom and bust. A lot of money was made - then lost - quickly. And there were winners (plural) as well as many, many losers. There is absolutely a bubble in crypto (did you see the action in Cagecoin for example, hilarious). But until the bubble goes mainstream I don't think it will pop. When it does, you'll be safe in the longer term if you hold a few strong currencies, including BTC. 
The total value of all crypto is still absolutely tiny, a fraction of the value of a major corporation. This is like early 1999 in dot com terms.

"Is there room for a few strong golds?" - well, yes, if you mean alternatives Silver, Platinum and other metals. 
"High fees and long transaction times are a feature. You want that." - you do? Not if you're setting up a currency that is widely adopted, as opposed to merely a store of wealth like gold.
"Bad press is irrelevant - no one wants to use bitcoin, they have to." Bad press affects the value of all currencies, including crypto, and is therefore highly relevant. Currencies are strong when there is confidence in their future. Bad press affects confidence.
"The crypto currency bubble does not have to go mainstream, and the SEC will prevent that from happening." I disagree on both counts. The SEC is one branch of one government. The appeal of crypto is anonymity and cross-border usage, the ability for those in countries with shitty banking systems and joke currencies to store and use wealth without the risks they currently face.
I sound like "an r/btc refugee"? That's part of the problem with BTC, this ridiculous petty squabbling among different factions.
"As for the total value of crypto - what was the total value of pogs? beanie babies? why is this metric relevant?" It's relevant because a low total value implies low usage. Crypto is not currently being used in any meaningful way. The bet here is that this will change, another bet being that the current crop of crypto currencies will be a major part of that. It may be that crypto does not grow as most of us hope, and it may also happen that the leading crypto currencies of the future haven't been created yet. But the risk/reward is still favourable.

It was karma, that I would make a joke about buying Dogecoin and then 2 months later see it's gone up by 15 times. FML :)

The budget for IT in the NHS is a joke. I agree, it was just a matter of time before this happened, and the heads that should roll are right at the top of the chain.
