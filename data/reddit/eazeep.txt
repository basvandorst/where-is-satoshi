Not only cause it’s performing well, but because why not? It’s exactly like bitcoin but is faster. It’s secured by miners, etc, it’s basically an exact copy of bitcoin yet different cause it has a bigger supply and is faster. What’s the issue here? It’s been around a fairly long time behind bitcoin. 
Are you saying we are only ever going to use bitcoin? I can’t imagine paying for things with bitcoin cause it doesn’t scale and it’s slow as shit. Great store of value. Average person isn’t going to learn how to use LN, and even then Ltc works on LN too.

Well luckily I have a pretty big pool of fiat to pull from. It’s almost enough for a Down payment in LA but more and more likely I may not end up buying property(weighing pros and cons) . I just spent more money this month than I had planned to. I definitely don’t have enough in my spending acc to buy the amount of crypto that I want right now.
Not worried though. I guess this is how it is when you have a good paying job with no loans and still live at home �� definitely not lasting too long though cause after I get married in February, life is gonna hit me hard. I guess I’d rather invest aggressively now while I can afford to

I’ve been dcaing since October 2017. But too much in 2017 honestly , close to breaking even though

IF this is true, it’s right about the time altcoins started booming, like 100x gains . ��

We’re at about a 30% correction from the local top. Anywhere from here to 35% - $9k or 40% - $8.5k is the PERFECT place to stack some sats
I’m dipping into some of savings now to get a little bit just Incase we have a bounce. Will replace it when payday comes

Buying a shit ton of shit coins instead, I shoulda stuck to btc and litecoin smh. Not that I don’t have any btc, I do, I would have a lot more though

@_date: 2019-07-12 14:24:20
No, that’s not what I’m saying at all. I’m saying that in the future we will need a crypto we can actually use as money. I’m not certain which one will be it but it’s 100% not going to be bitcoin, it’s too fucking slow. Ltc bcash nano , one of these three actually confirm/ transact fast enough to serve that purpose. My bet is it’s Ltc . I’d be foolish to be 100% in btc
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:52:46
Oh for sure. That would definitely be the minimum. A guy can dream though right

I personally believe there will be at least one more crypto boom. I’ll either look like an idiot but at least have a good salaried job , or I’ll get to retire early and y’all won’t ever hear from me again. It’s a risk worth taking imo and I think the higher risk is crypto not having another boom, since we seem to be on a 4 year cycle, if it doesn’t this time around then I’m going to say it’s completely over. But as far as the facts go, we’re still on a cycle and heading toward an uptrend

@_date: 2019-11-12 16:10:44
Agreed, i'm 28 and all my peers/friends do not trust bitcoin or cryptos. They all think it's a scam or a giant bubble. Basically 95% of them have a negative connotation towards btc. They are so enslaved to the dollar
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:08:16
I mean regardless even at 300k although it’s a significant amount of money, it’s not radically changing my life if the argument is you only need one btc
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:21:33
Fair enough. Everyone has different definitions and standards of life changing. Mine would be to never have to work a day in my life again, would love to be able to purchase multiple properties

Who walks into starbucks and purchases coffee anymore? It's the other way around. People order on their phones through starbucks apps and pick up coffee. Get with the times and this is only going to become even more of the norm and possibly 100% of orders in the next 5-10 years especially as boomers die
@_date: 2019-11-01 19:16:41
No the opposite actually. My response is for people who complain about how slow btc is to transact. But I’m arguing that it’s not an issue if you’re going to be mobile ordering anyway. I just wasn’t being explicit which I should’ve learned by now I should be considering how dense people on Reddit are
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:26:34
I think that time would be VERY far away. Even in the next bull cycle I don’t see btc topping 140kish and probably retracing to about 20k
@_date: 2019-03-26 01:44:53
Well software wallets aren’t bad since they provide you with a secret key you can access your btc anywhere 
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:08:02
He's going to say he made a mistake not buying bitcoin at $10,000..... some people just dont learn
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:14:21
More and more places i've been shopping at do not accept even hundred dollar bills. Not like i've used cash in a long time anyway. Almost every single store uses/accepts credit/debit cards as well as apple pay now. When bitcoin/cryptos go mainstream, i'm expecting the transition to not be too extreme
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:09:40
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:45:54
How is it exactly competing with btc? Btc is uncorrolated to almost every asset right now. Libra is and will always be one dollar per Libra

How much bitcoin would make you guys happy ? I had a number in my head that I hoped to reach which was 5 bitcoin, was only able to accumulate just a little less than half that this year. Still up 150% so not bad , just wish I reached my target number
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:54:55
The point about bitcoin also falling along with other assets only makes sense if it’s all tied to dollars. If dollars fail, ultimately wouldn’t we just value bitcoin as bitcoin, regardless of its dollar tied value ?

What even is money anymore?!
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:42:48
This does make sense even though my knowledge of economics is very limited. 
Our economic success is built on spending and piling up debt. It’s a hamster wheeel that needs to keep churning which is what causes innovations and our society to improve as a whole. My only concern is how long can we keep this wheel turning without slowing down? And what are the outcomes of massive amounts of debt and massive amounts of inflow of new cash into our system ?
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:56:09
Surely this isn’t sustainable for infinity. I try to draw from past societies and I suppose something like Ancient Rome is an example of a society that thrives until it didn’t

@_date: 2019-06-26 15:42:53
Mad at myself for trying to outsmart the market. Average BTC buy in at $4000. At $5600 sold a BTC expecting a correction, NOPE jumped up past 6k. Sold another BTC expecting a correction, NOPE jumped up past 7.5k. Small corrections here and there, jumped up past 8.5k, bought back in... been holding since. Got damn I missed a lot of gains.... never trading again and just holding no matter what now

Btw, I would take a look at LTC, not to buy LTC but the price movement. BTC has been following LTC on this runup, ltc halvening has been a big talk in terms of bullish moves

To be honest, a more accurate scenario is the restaurant is still waiting to receive their btc. Shits not gonna scale well once it’s mass adopted , better as a store of value imo

@_date: 2019-12-15 02:11:54
Never said I’m convincing them to. Their curiosity leads them to asking more questions and eventually leads to asking how much a bitcoin is then when they hear that one is over 7k it’s usually like no thanks

Awesome reply! Didn’t expect some great recommendations for wallets, I’ll check them out, thanks
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:52:14
It definitely is, we are in the accumulation zone, but anywhere between 3.5k to now is a good time to accumulate regardless, because after 6k, we are shooting for the freaking moon. 200k by 2021 eoy 
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:05:44
8000% growth after each subsequent low. That has been the historical trend. Shit is gonna look tiny compared to the next bull peak, possibly around 200k. So yes, listen to OP.

My biggest position is bitcoin. But I have hard time believing it’s going to be bitcoin only. I actually love how nano works but much better than bitcoin as a means of payment - send/receiving cause it’s lightning fast and free. Idk much about the security stuff but as an average person it just works much better. I understand human psychology though and btc does have huge first mover advantage and proven network over 10 years so I’m keeping my stack there too.... but I’d be damned if Nano doesn’t also succeed just based on ease of use/user experience ?

I'm no economist nor am i educated in this stuff, but mind if i ask what are the effects if the US turned out like japan? I ask this because US is at the center of the economy, the US dollar is the world reserve/currency is it not? So what in turn would the ripple effects be, globally?

Better as in it doesn’t take an hour to transfer your btc. My btc is still stuck and has 0 confirmations after I sent from my wallet to an exchange an hour and a half ago. Slow AF
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:13:46
Based on what? In great market conditions yes generally red days are good time to pick up. But stocks has been on a massive run for 10 years now and macro economics does not look very good. My bet is yeah if you hold a long time 50+ years you will enjoy 200% gains . Good luck waiting that long
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:17:54
We can all agree that crypto is inevitable . Let’s leave it at that for now.
God damn you guys can’t agree we’re even in the same space, but only that bitcoin is king. Fuck outta here, we’re all against the same thing you petty fucks
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:15:14
I don’t care about that. Can you tell me if I’m screwed or if I just have to keep waiting ???
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:03:51
Good. I’m glad it’s still getting lots of hate and negative publicity. I need more time to accumulate, when everyone is positive and certain about btc, I know it’s too late for massive returns
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:18:33
Why do I have to learn ??? Why can’t it just work ?? I don’t have issues with my alts that transfer in less than a few seconds
I just read your link and I am more confused than ever. It doesn't explain how to use replace by fee, at least from my software wallet.

??? I'm up a good amount from buying coins including btc in february. In terms of costing money per transaction? Not really, a good amount of my transactions are through Nano and it's feeless. The only real hassle has been BTC as I can't trade it as readily as other coins if I want to switch between my wallet and exchange. 
What's the issue here? i'm only stating facts. Not like I dont like Bitcoin, but i definitely see the pros and cons. It's the best store of value crypto, but I just don't see it working (for transactions)... as intended.

I’m not refuting anything you’re saying. What point of that don’t you get. But I’m also having issues with transactions , like right now as we speak. A transaction I started 4 hours ago on my BRD wallet is still pending. Wtf is up with that. Is the network jammed ? I’ve never had it get stuck like this for this long

I can safely say I’m the only one of my friends that took time to DCA , stay on top of the news , learn more about dlt/crypto, from the Dec 2017 bull run till now . Suffice to say, now they are hitting their heads against the wall by not doing the same
