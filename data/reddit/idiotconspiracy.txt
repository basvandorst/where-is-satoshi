I'm glad you pointed out the sarcasm at the end because I really wasn't sure.

If that doesn't suit I hear there are some nice deals in Palestine.

That all depends on how you define money laundering. The common definition is taking the proceeds of crime and using it in a way that makes it appear to be gained legitimately. Anyone could easily buy some BTC, send it through a mixer and hold it without commiting any crime.

There is zero scientific evidence to support anything you just mentioned.
If you want the best chances of success; find the best oncologist available and follow his/her advice.

I do beleive it qualifies as 'thought provoking insight'. If you are going to go off the rails and start name calling as soon as someone holds a contradictory viewpoint then maybe you need to grow up a little bit.

Managed funds etc are so easy to set up that there really isn't any excuse for leaving your cash rotting away in the bank.

Anyone using BTC for more 'controversial' purchases are gonna be sending it through a mixer first anyway. (If they don't they are dumb and deserve to get fucked over.)

Its a shitty Newscorp rag. The vast majority of their 'Journalists' are severely lacking in even basic common sense or rational thought.
