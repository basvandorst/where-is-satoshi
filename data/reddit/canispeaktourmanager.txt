Are you fucking retarded? Deposit insurance is handled by the FDIC in the US and the CDIC in Canada - both government institutions. Credit Unions are insuranced by the NCUA, again a federal agency. Deposit insurance isn't managed by private insurance companies. See, you hate the big bad banks and yet you don't know jack about the financial system or its safeguards.
Thanjs for the offer though, personally I like assets that don't lose 75% of their value in less than three months.

Are you buying more BTC during the dip?
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:47:18
God you're incredibly short sighted. Ever thought how maybe the threat prosecution for AML serves as a deterrent? Imagine if a Russian mobster bought a condo at Trump Tower with funds he acquired from illicit activities. The condo could then be sold in a year and the proceeds of the sale would be clean. This Russian mobster could then do a number of things with this clean money: make "legitimate" deposits into a bank account without further suspicion, take out loans, commit mortgage fraud, make investments funding further ventures or illicit activities.
Simply put, AML stops further crime from being committed and prevents criminals from benefitting financially. Your previous posts are overlysimplified scenarios and don't take into account contexts of transnational crime, corruption etc. In my previous example, the Russian mobster may have paid off the prosecutor that was investigating the "initial crime" and he therefore doesn't get sanctioned on the illicit activity. Not every country has the same level of integrity in their justice system.
Let me give you another scenario: a corrupt public official in a developing country in South East Asia has been accepting bribes which he then launders through a side business, say a local high end restaurant. He then applies for citizenship in Cyprus which requires a property purchase of 2 millions euros. The agent in Cyprus only sees that the applicant made his money as a public official and a successful restaurant he owned. The applicant is then given Cyrprus citizenship (and EU citizenship by extension) and when local investigators start paying more attention he moves to Europe, sells his property in Cyprus and is never heard from again.
Do you see how AML is much more complicated than the complete oversimplification you initially discussed?

Yes, but as long as it is used as a currency in niche situations (you mentioned online gambling for instance), there will always be a limit to how much it is widely accepted by society. People fall back on the dollar because it has some consistent value that people perceive over time plus easy of use, ability take out revolving credit on a fixed amount.
About credit, here's a topic that I may make a full post for, but would love your opinion on: imagine a fictional world where most people now use Bitcoin as a common currency for every-day transactions. You want to buy a house, but you obviously dont have the money to make the full payment so you look at mortgage options. Lets say the house costs the equivalent of 10 Bitcoin, so you need the bank to give you a loan of 9 bitcoin.
With the extreme volatility of these cryptos you will inevitably end up with one of two situations: the institution the lent you the 9 bitcoins gets fucked over because the value of each coin has diminished significantly OR your mortgage becomes increasingly expensive (remember, you have to pay back 9 bitcoin - regardless of what the dollar value is).
Do you see this as tenable in any way?
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:53:39
I mean, you can put a stop loss - did you know that?
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:00:02
That's literally not how government spending works.
During economic depression you inject capital into the economy through stimulus programs and lower interest rates (done by the Fed). When the economy goes on the upswing you pay down the debt.
If you're constantly spending capital reserves with increased borrowing then inflation gets out of control. (see early 1980s).
What do you expect to happen during the next downturn?

Did you even read his post? Bitcoin as a currency is at odds with bitcoin as an investment vehicle.
You need to spend currency for your daily expenses, but you think that holding bitcoin will one day make you rich. The incentive here is to spend your dollars and save up your bitcoins (if you think that holding bitcoins will one day make you rich).

How do you know?
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:17:14
First of all, you're misusing the term "interest".
Second, different investors buy in a different price points, for different reasons with different time horizons. Some people invested at $100 per BTC and had a goal of holding for 5+ years. Those investors have a lot of incentive to sell right now. Others invested at $8k and are wondering whether they should take their money and run. Other investors went in at $15k and are very nervous right now.
Yes, everyone's objective is to make a profit. But many investors have already made theirs and have cashed out (ie sold their stake). When more and more investors start selling off then your market price starts dropping.

I am a middle-class millenial and own a diversified stock portfolio, which I contribute to consistently. I will have enough money invested to make a downpayment on a house within the next 5-10 years and will most likely be a millionaire by my mid 50s.
My point is that I am investing intelligently with clear objectives in mind, unlike Crypto gamblers here who are chasing instant gratification - putting their money in nonsense ponzi schemes because they "believe in the project" or "that it has a great team".

Again, not entirely true. Certain companies may simply never give out the dividend. For example, look at Netflix stock - dividend yield 0%. Certain firms may judge that re-investing retained earnings may be more beneficial for the investor.
Apple has only recently started giving out a dividend (around 1%), but for decades it didn't. Tencent - one of the largest companies in the world by market cap gives out a dividend of less than 1%. You'd be hard pressed to find a correlation between size of a company and div yield. In fact be wary of companies with 6%+ yields, these are often companies that are in trouble and are trying to retain investors.

It's very simple - it's all about incentives and how the individual's incentives clash with society's as a whole. The individual's ultimate individual benefit is to pay literally $0 in taxes and for society to pay it all. Obviously this would be nonsensical because then no one would pay. This is also why tax accountants make so much money ;)
If you're suggesting that there should be some sort of checklist of what government services you actually want to pay for, here's my rebuttal: oftentimes we pay for services that we don't currently need, but may need eventually - think social security, medicare, medicaid. Most of the benefit of these services goes to the elderly who themselves pay very little taxes, whereas you - the middle-class income earner - are essentially subsidizing them. Now this may be problematic to you because you are currently not benefiting from these services, however you will most likely one day need them.
Another example where you pay into something that doesn't directly benefit you is education. Well you can tell yourself "Hey I'm already educated! Why should I pay for that?". Well the simple answer is that everyone as a child benefitted from education and... Well the money has to come from somewhere to educate future generations!
For military expenses - yeah it sucks knowing a gigantic chunk of the budget is spent on useless tanks that they'll never use or million dollar missiles which will inevitably end up killing innicents. The only response I have here is: help elect politicians who aren't warmongers. Having a strong military is necessary for world peace. Starting needless wars isn't.

What a ridiculous title. Pointing to the worst possible example of failed monetary policy only highlights how good monetary policy can be highly beneficial to a country.

On the contrary, your voice is actually stripped when you stop participating in the system. I'm not saying voting is the only answer, but stuff like protests, participating in primaries, exposing misdeeds on social media. It all has an impact.
Telling yourself you're going to exile yourself from society because politicians suck is the surest way for more sucky politicians to get elected and for fucky policy to get imposed on you and me.

Can we stop with these bullshit idiotic posts now? A certain amount of inflation is always infinitely better for the economy than deflation. You know there's a reason your parents made $2 an hour for their first job and you made $8.

Yeah remember when Obama was criticized by the media for eating spicy mustard?

Well then! Maybe I stand corrected. Are these standards the same in North America? Also here's my question:
- Buyer of a house takes out a mortgage from the bank
- Bank pays the seller of that house
- Buyer of the house now owes that equal amounts plus interest
Where does the money then come from? Or if it's answered in the article can you please point me to which page.

If you're actually considering tax evasion as a viable strategy, I'd be really careful. They don't mess around.

I agree, public resources are badly allocated. Why are people going bankrupt from a surgery or cancer treatment when $millions worth of bombs are dropped on a country on the other side of the world. Why are teachers paid shit salaries while society's richest get yet another gigantic tax break. Why do megadonors get direct access to politicians and influence policy, while the common joe has 0 say in the process.
I'm not tone deaf to what you're saying and i agree the whole system is bullshit. Money in politics is absolutely disgusting and the Cotizens United decision was horrible for representative democracy. This needs to be reversed ASAP.
To directly answer your question about taxes, we don't live as individuals on little islands. We all need some common things (safety, education, infrastructure, etc.). It wouldn't make sense for everyone to have to pay for a private bodyguard or private teacher or private air traffic controller etc. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:25:41
That is not entirely true. Different investors have different objectives with stocks they own. For instance, investors may want a company to re-invest their retained earnings in order to grow the company instead of making a distribution.
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:09:11
Well I'm honestly not sure what point you're trying to make. Highly taxed countries enjoy by far the highest standard of living throughout the world. The money has to come from somewhere if you want to pay for a strong military, good teachers, clean water, well maintained roads and infrastructure, healthcare, retirement pensions, etc.

Not sure why you felt the need to write a 300 word rebuttal to my source. The study was conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University, not Business insider. They make that obvious in the very first paragraph.

See that's the thing with living in an advanced society. You pay into the system in order for society as a whole benefits. Public schools, pension plan, medicare, medical research, military. All of these are hallmarks of a developed nation that collects taxes and uses those taxes to give services to its citizens.
Of course, you're always free to leave that society and renounce your citizenship if you dont accept the terms. There are a fair number of countries out there that dont collect taxes. They're also generally either shitholes or hardcore theocracies.
It's really your choice honestly.
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:45:34
So what your saying is you have a shit government who don't make it a priority to upgrade infrastructure? How about not voting in shitty representatives?

Everyone is making more money in both real and nominal terms but yes I agree that income inequality has become a significant issue. Crypto is not going to solve that, but good public policy will.

So then go vote for people who's policy interests align with your own.

No, but you can vote for a different rep who will hopefully manage your money better.

I hear you brother. I have a degree in finance and work in fintech. (not crypto related)
Yes, a stock can be valued by all present and future cash flows (including div yield), but in terms of investor psychology it may make more sense for a company to perpetually reinvest its retained earnings. Not every type of investor is looking for income. For example, a retiree may love dividends because it provides cashflow, however a young investor may want a company to simply reinvest retained earnings in order to increase its growth and allow for more price appreciation (remember - there is generally a price drop with dividends are distributed).
Also yes, I am aware Bitcoin has never (and will never) pay out a dividend.
