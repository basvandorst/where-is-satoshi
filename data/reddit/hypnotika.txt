Unless you're cashing out over 20k and doing it through Coinbase or Gemini, why would you be paying taxes anyway? Or, you can just buy a bunch of stuff on Overstock and re-sell it to cash out. Also, fuck taxes, and fuck the IRS. The progressive tax system in America is theft.

This is pure comedy.

Bull run and lots of media attention right now. There will probably be a correction of 10-15% in the next few weeks. I wouldn't buy now over $3800.

He ain't wrong

Bitcoin will never replace FIAT currency unless they find a way to scale it! Otherwise some other crypto will or many other Cryptocurencies will be used.

...and this is why we have people buying $1000 worth of shitcoins instead.
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:32:53
Yea, bc Ver and his chronies aren't spamming the network with millions of microtransactions this time.
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:30:56
I suggest you head over to r/btc and ask about that. They don't like much BCH talk here on r/Bitcoin.

Lol, you must Hold ETH. We forget what ATH means
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:11:18
It's supposed to say $8000!

"...I still have a lot of money in Bitcoin" 
What if I told you, Bitcoin is money?
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:58:39
I did the same thing at 6200 and turned it around to a Long at 6500, so I'm almost back to even and can just get out!
@_date: 2018-11-19 02:51:55
This again? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:38:48
The people that bought at 20k are paying for these ads.
@_date: 2019-01-08 04:02:27
Are you ready for $3300?
@_date: 2019-01-29 09:15:16
Taxation is theft any how.

Seriously tho....fuck stocks. Crypto is the heat. Bitcoin and ETH are the future money. You can keep your corrupt traditional financial system that makes the rich richer and keeps the poor poor. That being said, the crypto rich need to put there money where their mouths are too!

Honestly, anybody that falls for this shit deserves to lose $600.

Ethereum is the only reason why crypto is on the map. Get real. Bitcoin forking 3 times in a span of a few months is bad for business. You cannot create value out of thin air. Whatever value that Bitcoin Cash, BitGold, and the possibility of a core coin/S2X coin, retain, that is all value that could have been in the Bitcoin price. That is why we will see a huge dump of BTC after the fork and prices will settle around $4500-$4800, before they can begin to climb as people sell off their BTG and B2X or whatever types of bitcoins they have, for the dominant Bitcoin chain. The only real value that Bitcoin has after 9 years in existence is built on speculation. Until we see real mass adoption when exchanging goods and services, this is all speculation. Side note, I do accept Bitcoin and Ethereum at my place of business.

The only think in the universe that has value is time, but even still, if the universe, if existence of all things is actually infinite, then even time has no true value.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:22:28
Even with Segwit2x, Bitcoin is still way too slow for mass adoption.
