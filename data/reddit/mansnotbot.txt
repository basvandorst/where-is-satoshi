You've just hit on why Bitcoin will never reach the heights some dreamers think it will.
It's inherently deflationary, so that will always be the case.

Currency is not a ticket to Disney World and its really not comparable in any way.
I'm happy to debate you on this, but you'll need a different analogy.

thats not how it works. The fact that there will eventually be a point where no more BTC can be mined is why it is inherently deflationary.
Dude, if you think interest rates don't matter to global economics, all i can say is that you should read a few books. Interest rates changes (especially as big as 1%) make a huge difference.

labor theory of value has been disproven over and over for centuries. It doesn't stick.

tell that to all the poor kids in public schools.


You're free to be as wrong as you like, but people won't think highly of your intelligence for it.


It's not an assumption, its plain to see from the words you say.

People have lost more money to Bitcoin hacks than I’ve ever lost in my bank account, so I don’t agree with that.
I’d be deeply uncomfortable storing all my value in Bitcoin.

That sentence doesn’t even mean anything. Shame.

Ok, so long as I get to tell it to every single other country in existence that hasn’t lost everything overnight.
You people are zealots.

or, more realistically, you're just seriously out of your depth with zero real understanding of economics, finance or what you're even reading.
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:43:32
No. This is dumb as fuck.
Do you realise how little growth we've had for most of our existence? Compare the progress we saw from the last couple hundred years to the last couple thousands of years beforehand. It's incomparable.
"Life" did not produce computers or planes for thousands of years. You may not like how unmagical it is, but you literally owe the entire world around you to the existence of debt instruments. They're how we have funded grand projects that would have seen the light of day otherwise.

Fucking hell, old ladies are not more important than the rest of our economy.
Inflation makes people reinvest their money instead of hoarding it in a way that is unproductive to society. That is not a bad thing.

i really hope this is sarcasm.

Economists do and its basically nowhere.
Bitcoin has fundamental flaws that stop it from achieving mass appeal. Even bitcoiners can't help but use it as an investment vehicle and 'hodl'.

the matter is not mathematical.
Wozniak is out of his depth.

All economies are based off consumerism. We need things to live and enjoy living.
If you think you want one that isn’t, you’re out of your mind.
