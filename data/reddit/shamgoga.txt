I understood about 5% of this, but it was a good 5%.  Would watch again.

You've got to set up port forwarding on your modem/router to forward port 8333 to the private IP of the machine hosting the bitcoin node.

Can you clarify what is meant be public/private part of the network?  What is the difference between public and private nodes, and where can I read more about this?

What's the advantage of having a static IP on lightning network?  Does LN use a gossip protocol like bitcoin mainnet to share IP's of peers?

Can someone help me understand how this invoice works?  I put it into a decoder at   Which field there represents the recipient of the payment?

I mean, if I lose my channel state and use my static backup, doesn't that mean I'm closing the channel by broadcasting an old channel state?  So I can be penalized by the other side after recovering from backup, and lose everything?

Ohh I see.  So it still requires co-operation from the other side.
Game theory wise, if someone connects to me and shows me that they lost their channel db and need me to close it for them, why wouldn't I just broadcast an older state that gives me the most money?

Longest bear market? Wha?  From the peak in late 2013, through until the peak in late 2017, was far longer.

Can you elaborate on that?  If you can recover the funds, then doesn't that include channel funds?

Lol "the halvening".  Sounds funny to hear that on TV.
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:47:13
Got any docs on how the static backups work?  I'm curious, because I thought you have to broadcast the latest channel state when closing, otherwise the other party can penalize you and take everything.

I edited my comment above to ask another qn before you answered.  But it seems that the other party could have an incentive to cheat.
