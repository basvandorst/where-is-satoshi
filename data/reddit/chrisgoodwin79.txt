Who made up this chart, LTC is closer to $1-$2 in fees, and BCH is around $0.003 cents. BCH also has 0-conf and is now accepted at Bitpay.

Kind of like how Steve Jobs forked off and started NeXT, using his own efforts to upgrade the Macintosh operating system, unveiling faster workstations, NeXT still lives on as the heart of Mac OS X. Interesting how things work out...

I've never understood the don't spend Bitcoin argument, as the OP was going to spend the money anyways. 
For instance, my brother loves his credit card, for the rating, points, whatever, but he loves to swipe the payment and take my cash whenever we're together. Clearly he has to pay off the balance within the month, but he loves doing it.
The same can be done with Bitcoin, scan the payment, and take the cash. Buy back the same amount right away, or even gamble and wait and buy in a dip. 
And if you're cleaver, you buy the bitcoin a month early, and are paying rent with 30 day old BTC prices, and when you use that cash to buy bitcoin, for rent next month, the gains continue. 
So I just don't get the deflationary argument, as it still needs more adoption.

low-cost? quick exchange of value? rapid movement of capital?
Average Fee is currently $28 with over 2K transactions costing $1k or more. Average confirmation time is currently over 2 days with over 200K unconfirmed transactions. How is that low cost, quick or rapid?

Both futures and shorting involve a counterparty. In futures, one part goes long, the other short, for a contract. In shorting, one person is HODLing, but willing to lend for a fee, and the borrower is selling short. 
Now that there are futures, there will be more brokers willing to lend shares for short positions, even on margin. It's going to be a wild ride.

BCH blocks are never full, so double spends are impossible. All transactions get seen almost instantly, and the first seen rule guarantees you'll have confirmations. BCH also allows for zero fee transactions, but most wallets charge at least 1 sat/byte. BCH 0-conf is totally safe for most transactions. For large transactions, you'd probably want to wait for 1-3 confirmations. 
It is only BTC that has full blocks, and 150K unconfirmed transactions that is unsafe.

0-conf is not a safe thing on BTC, but BCH doesn't have replace by fee, segwit, etc. 0-conf is very safe on BCH, and can be made more so for merchants with high volume by running a full node.

I have been reading that more than 50% of all BTC wallets have amounts in them that are unspendable? With new examples daily, this is becoming concerning. I have 3 BTC wallets that have significant enough balances, that are unspendable.

Not $500K, but I have moved $5k from CAN to the UK, and it was under $2 in fees a year ago, and took an hour. Now it would cost me $400, and take days. And many people think $1k fees and weeks to confirm is totally fine. Again, how is that low cost, quick or rapid? When I could send you $5k of BCH for $0.02 cents and be confirmed instantly.

Shorting means borrowing shares, selling them, And buying back lower. You are betting the price will go lower, and will make money on the way down. You don't always have to do it on margin.
Imagine you had 10 btc at $10k, now it's $15k, and you think it's going down. You sell your 10 btc for $150k, and use that as collateral to borrow another 10 btc, or on margin, you could borrow 100 btc. And sell those. Now you have another $150k, or maybe $1.5m, and to close the position, if BTC goes back down to $10, it will only cost you $100k or $1m to buy back the 10 btc or 100 btc and close your position with the person you borrowed from. For a fee! 
So you started with $150k, now you could have $50k more, or even $500k more, minus fees of borrowing...

0.08 BTC transaction fee? (1300 USD) (self.Bitcoin)
submitted 11 hours ago by blopaaa
Hi. So, I have around 0.3 BTC that I got from mining back in the day, and I decided to sell it, but when I tried to transfer my Bitcoin to a exchange, I got a transaction fee of 0.08 BTC (1300 USD). What? :(
How can I avoid that? This is the message I got:
"This is an oversized bitcoin transaction! Your wallet needs to consolidate many smaller payments you've received in the past. This requires a relatively high fee in order to be confirmed quickly."

I've used TheBitcoinMachine at most hasty markets in Toronto, as well as Lamassu in other stores, in both cases I buy LTC or BCH, as the mining fees are much lower, and the convenience fees for using the machine is also usually much lower. I have purchased BTC, but never had an error like that, just the usual 15-30% markup others have mentioned. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:58:58
Right, so BTC is now slower and more expensive, than a traditional wire transfer? If you want to move all payment transactions to a different coin? Why not all the value storage as well? As it seems more exchanges and investment groups are moving to using BCH as the normalised settlement layer, and all trading pairs will be priced in BCH. The new global reserve crypto currency is becoming BCH. The new crypto ecosystem will consist of BCH exchange platforms; hedge fund management; financing; mining; ICO and exchange platform rating information services; a derivatives market; remittance services; and transaction/payments services. SBI Group, Binance, Bitstamp, Bittrex, CoinEx, Cex, ViaBTC, Will Trade Only BCH Currency Pairs.

Basically, you can short btc like any stock, sell most or all of your BTC, then borrow 10x or 20x more on margin, and sell that. Wait for price to drop, buy back in low, and close your short position.

Yeah, not sure I've ever seen BTC:BCH at 1:2? Or even all other exchanges showing 1:4... going to be a fun night.

I was given $25 in Bitcoin last Christmas, it's too bad you can't do that anymore with the tx fees and transaction times. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:09:16
Many do. But why not most? I can only assume, looking at all the various models of bitcoin ATMs, that some are a few hundred, some are a few thousand, and the ones that can payout dollars, are upwards of ten thousand or more if you want them to hold more bills.

Right, the analogy fits. The original dev left Apple core and created Macintosh cash. But in the world of open source it's Apple cash. Steve Jobs would have been morally right to start Apple 2.0. But we are still in the middle of that saga with Bitcoin, we're still in 1995.

I assume he's referring to the $100 of BTC Abd BCH he was going to give away. He funded both wallets at $5 a time, 20 times, BTC had $78 in fees. BCH had $0. Many merchants, home miners, gamers, etc would get paid in $5 increments. Then try sending the $100 BTC or BCH? With the average fee approaching $20 or more, $100 in fees is not far off. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:23:39
Even worse than $1000 fees are all the posts of people excited for crypto for the first time, buying $50, and then sending some to a friend, to a site, or whatever, and end up with $9, or $19, cause the fee was so high... it must be crushing to the spirit. I have 3 btc wallets with significant enough balances that are unspendable. I'm also reading more than 50% of all BTC wallets have balances that are unspendable. How can that last?

That's not what I was told, if it's in your TFSA, I doubt you are going to pay capital gains. Maybe I'm wrong. I've been in MGTI since July, and I didn't sell when it spiked to $4 in Late August. But I expect a good NR to reverse the trend.
