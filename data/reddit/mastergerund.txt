Cannot emphasize this enough. You must wait one month to repurchase *no matter what the price does during that month* or you cannot take the taxable loss.

I was trying to think up some way I could use it to have people buy stuff through my own Amazon storefront, so I pocket the money from Amazon and use it to cycle through coins...
Then I thought of reversals, and realized there was zero chance of it not blowing up in my face. Bitcoin buyer uses stolen card, buys items, receives bitcoins, and then... reversal city.

(End price - start price) / start price = return
Care to redo your calculations? Without leverage it is impossible to have a negative return greater than 100%

When going up, you would buy fewer coin each time, and would gradually raise your average cost, but your average cost per coin would still be lower than the average price over the same period.
This isn't exactly news, and I wasn't claiming it was. I was merely suggesting that if a lot of people followed this strategy they would make money, and if enough people followed this strategy it would stabilize the price of bitcoin and create gradual upward pressure.

I recently started using Bitreserve to dca into more diversified exposure. I think for traditional currencies it would perform better with a little leverage, as daily volatility is typically too small to notice without it. That changes the math a bit.

Would you like to explain what words I am not understanding, or just make pointless ad hominem attacks?

And it already happened once.
My real issue with your comment is the assumption that price movement is long term random, so one return is more likely than the other. (If prices are completely random, a nice to almost 0 would be more likely from the current price than a nice to 10000).
While I agree that short term prices have some degree of randomness built in, long term prices are driven a lot more by fundamentals.

I like the concept, but my above is about stabilizing bitcoin as much as profiting from it. In the long run, we all profit more from stability increasing adoption. Most trading boys actually increase volatility. I will check it out though, when I have a little time.

That's why I pointed out that spending is selling

So you you're hanging out in a sub dedicated to "a turd," and I'm the one who's misguided?
I do realize the entire strategy rests on the assumption that bitcoin is never going to zero. I would bet quite a lot that you can buy 10000 dollars with one bitcoin sooner than could buy 10000 bitcoin for one dollar.

Count me in. I run a full node. No mining but if the difficulty dropped enough I would

I wrote a whole post on this a week or two back, but I think only a half dozen people saw it.

I do listen to my music on vinyl. And CD, and mp3, and streaming. I see bitcoin similarly. A small percentage of each paycheck goes in, as an option on future utility.

I don't follow why this is illegal. There are sites like loyal3 where you can own fractional shares. The only difference is the ability to pay with bitcoin and trade the micro units. There are sites like global credit that let you use bitcoin, but you are technically trading cfd on whole shares. There is no reason you could not have cfd on micro shares.

I'm a little curious about how you got from the 6.4% cited in the article to half...

To comply with regulations, the app is probably checking location data when you use it and would block transactions if you were outside their service footprint.

Nah. I don't own enough coin for that move to have a meaningful impact on my lifestyle.
