I respectfully disagree. Why would we wait 18 months for lightning if it wasn't intended to make payments?

This is great news! You'll only need 0.0028 BTC in a LN hub before someone can transfer their life savings. This is why BTC is so amazing!

Bitcoin (BTC) is only costly to store and hard to use unless you are using the lightning network.. Everyone should set up their lightning hub. NO fees for days

Actually... SegWit isn't a full 2x block size increase. It's somewhere near 1.6x. Even then, it wasn't intended to be a block size increase. The real power of SegWit comes with the fact that it makes Lightning work on top of BTC.
If you want to make full use of SegWit. I suggest you set up a lightning node. As a bonus, you get to run a full bitcoin node

Gold is counter to the lightning network. Why would the Core devs put so much emphasis on the lightning network if they really wanted us to treat BTC like gold. You should try setting up a LN hub. You can even buy stickers from blockstream using LN

Does anybody else think Breaking Bitcoin is a poor choice in name?? wouldn't want the bcashers to read too much into this..

Bitcoin IS the best. As long as you're running your Lightning node anyway... Thank gawd for Elizabeth Stark as well as Poon and Dryja. If it weren't for them Bitcoin (BTC) would be in big trouble
