That bitcoin will eventually regain it's value. If it was completely taken away it would just be gone forever. Keeping the price stable for a relatively short period of time is worthless compared to how much money people would continue to lose propping up an incompetent company like MtGox.

That's kind of a shitty gift honestly. Hey here's this complicated thing you have to figure out how to use now. Its value is variable and I probably couldn't afford to give you very much. It's like giving a gift card that's a drag to get to actually using. Enjoy!

So people who write about these huge fluctuations in price are mentally challenged? Most of the posts on the front page aren't about the price anyway don't get your panties in a twist

It's still growing. As more people come in the wealth will be spread out more. Early adopters obviously have a much bigger share. Billions of people in the world have some degree of wealth. Right now a much smaller group of people have bitcoins. 
Also, didn't someone determine that some of the top wallets were exchanges? It would make sense for them to have a pretty large amount of bitcoin since so much trade goes through them.

So how safe is it to store bitcoins in a site like coinbase? I don't have very much at all but should I need to have offline storage if I just have a little bit of money put into bitcoin?

Why are you mad though?

Wow. Are people really this full of themselves? "I bought some bitcoins now I'm guaranteed to be wealthy elite". This is a joke right?
