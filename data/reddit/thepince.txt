@_date: 2015-12-09 04:51:13
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:17:19
So much hate in those comments! I guess we have a long way to go.
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:01:31
Keep a lookout for the sequel, The Fall and Fall of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-06-10 23:45:34
This looks great but I'd love to be able to use it without having to use Coinbase. Any plans to integrate Circle?
@_date: 2014-09-06 13:10:42
Those comments tho.
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:26:00
Looks like we're going to hit 126k by the end of the day.
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:17:29
My country just banned bitcoin. Is this actually good news?
@_date: 2014-04-20 13:46:08
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:43:32
Fuck you Apple. Long love Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:44:37
She should do a collaboration with Zhou Tonged :)
@_date: 2014-12-31 23:00:31
Gone? The coin is still worth over $9. Im a paycoin hater myself but this thread screams of scared butthurt.
@_date: 2014-07-16 01:06:34
@_date: 2014-04-20 13:39:08
Aaaannd price drop.
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:41:30
Good news this actually is.
@_date: 2014-01-06 05:57:20
Where can I get one?
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:17:30
This is gentlemen.
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:14:12
@_date: 2014-08-14 11:22:34
Maybe he is..
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:14:27
Don't worry, we'll be back to these prices in a few days. :'(
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:19:35
He could buy more than a few pizzas with that.
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:13:34
Where you sitting bro?  I'll keep an eye out for you.
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:55:35
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:55:32
Just bought an item on Overstock with bitcoin!  If you are able to, I think everyone here should buy at least a small item!
@_date: 2014-12-31 15:17:31
Circle is the absolute easiest and quickest way for most people to obtain bitcoins. It should be listed on the front page ffs.
@_date: 2014-07-15 22:08:23
I don't even completely understand what happened, but here, have an upvote!
@_date: 2014-10-02 11:39:08
This isn't true... Circle itself charges no fees, and their exchange rate is very fair imo.
@_date: 2014-07-31 20:07:23

Snoop, where you at?
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:13:02
This news is actually good!
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:17:15
Is there anywhere I can view your exchange rate? I was just wondering if it was comparable to the Coinbase rate. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 23:26:50
This could actually be good news.
@_date: 2014-07-18 18:30:56
In b4 PayPal buys Coinbase ;P
@_date: 2014-05-07 21:55:10
Any more songs coming out?

This must be your first time watching a Zhou Tonged video.
@_date: 2014-06-06 04:53:41
It's because the Mac Donald's line crossed over the descending triangle.
@_date: 2014-12-31 23:49:09
My bad. 6.40 is pretty low. Down with paycoin!
@_date: 2014-06-19 11:34:12
They've actually been accepting bitcoin for over a year, since the very beginning of Swearnet!
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:06:42
Wow, my first ever tip. I'll have to finally see what this changetip thing is all about. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:46:13
Where do you get your BTC market price from?
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:49:09
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-09-10 10:58:56
Not surprised, Fallon is pro bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-29 21:16:09
How do you sweep private keys with bread wallet? I love this wallet but thought it was missing this feature.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:30:46
Slick as fuck.
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:37:41
This is hudge.
@_date: 2014-09-20 14:39:56
Quick, someone edit in a bitcoin over her face.

Gotta love this subreddit. Who wants to be a millionaire is top voted and this real news is a distant second. Lol.
@_date: 2014-08-28 21:21:36
RIP Hal, and thank you for your contributions.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:31:15
This is actually bad news.
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:10:15
Where is u/zhoutonged? I thought his album was supposed to drop last year..
@_date: 2015-01-18 01:42:38
Fucking Circle. Easy as shit.
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:50:07
I guess it was a mirage after all.
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:54:10
Thanks for proving my point.
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:49:13
Keep it up bro.
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:47:13
Ok I think I will because of your comment. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:43:48
It was all a mirage :(
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:41:33
Yes, I actually was fucking kidding. Calm yo tits.
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:58:36
They need to direct people on how to buy bitcoins quickly and easily.  If I was new to bitcoin this page would probably just confuse me, and it looks ameaturish. Would be much better off re-directing to Circle.com.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:38:58
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:44:20
They don't even accept players from the USA, negating one of the biggest advantages of accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:15:59
After reading some of those comments, I'm convinced that if bitcoin doesn't succeed, it will be because there are just too many stupid people out there.
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:16:32
Last I checked it was about 350.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:05:08
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:22:46
Holla atcha boi!
@_date: 2015-04-29 23:05:06
The name is awful, and the logo looks like a vagina.
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:24:37
@_date: 2015-04-09 14:23:33
It would be nice to use this without having to use Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-04-18 22:07:33

How has Bitcoin not sued this cracka
@_date: 2015-03-17 02:24:42
Dammit. Of course something like this happens right when the price is about to go up.
@_date: 2016-05-29 00:56:32

@_date: 2013-12-06 17:13:32
Fuck you Apple.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:39:07
Good job buddy. Would listen again.
@_date: 2013-05-07 19:47:34
Ever hear of Bitpay?
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:11:58
"just north of Detroit. Its in a middle class neighborhood".  It's not in Detroit, and there are plenty of decent neighborhoods around the city.
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:56:35
Wow, this could be huge.  Thanks man.
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:04:16
Still supposed to launch at 1pm(PST) today.  I'd honestly be surprised if it does though.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:25:14
Fucking gold.
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:25:01
Where can I get one? (Obv with my QR code) :p
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:19:26
Nothing stops this train.
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:00:36
Nice looking website.
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:02:50
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but why would they mine just to get transaction fees instead of mining an alt coin which could be more profitable?
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:58:17
BitcoinATM at 1pm(PST), whats at 2pm?
@_date: 2013-10-17 19:38:14
too daa mooon
@_date: 2013-03-27 04:09:29
Very, nice but I prefer the black background on Bitcoinity. Please make that an option!
@_date: 2013-06-28 16:18:47
Looks good. The name sort of confuses me though. It sounds like a website for musicians/bands.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:43:51
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:10:04
Re-tweeted and sent them an email on their website form.  GOGOGO!
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:27:27
Holy shit yes.
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:19:59
@_date: 2013-04-26 12:12:50
Anyone else catch the "Bitcoin user not affected" meme?
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:21:07
Yes, it's time to sell fiat. Why would you want that silly government Monopoly money anyway? Fuck fiat.
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:04:01
Sipping on some whisky and watching.
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:37:31
My dad called me last night to tell me he saw Bitcoin on the front page of Fox :)  He has only heard me mention it a few times before and really doesn't know anything about it.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:34:19
That's what he said.
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:06:34
I don't even use Silk Road or do any drugs (besides drink alcohol if you count that) and I agree with this statement.
@_date: 2013-06-15 14:39:06
1 btc seems like a fair price to me for something that is the first of its kind, and for the work these guys put into this project.
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:30:51
We've landed on the moon!
@_date: 2013-03-19 14:55:19
I bought a live pay per view online at Swearnet.com using bitcoin.  If you are familiar with the Trailer Park Boys then you probably have heard of the site.  I had no idea they accepted bitcoin until I saw the option in the checkout.  That was my first bitcoin purchase!
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:45:33
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:53:43
You might want to consider taking 1 or 2 of your coins and buying LTC with them.  LTC seems undervalued compared to BTC right now.
@_date: 2013-08-10 14:45:34
Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:18:37
You can't fight who you are.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:03:00
Is bitcoinbillionaire Satoshi himself??
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:42:10
Not only did he not test drive the car, he didn't even have to leave his basement. LOL. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:45:26
Deja vu anyone?
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:31:30
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:57:25
It's an easy, familiar way for non-techie people to get started in BTC. The more people holding BTC the better!
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:52:26
Here are the links to the individual tweets:
CHOO CHOO!!!
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:18:24
nice link op
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:10:01
I think this Snoop's Reddit account: 
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:07:34
DO WANT.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:30:08
Don't panic, the price will rise and fall. Ultimately, were breaking through the wall. The sky's the limit, and I'm in it to win it. So I'm just holding for the longest time.
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:32:51
This guy should be on TV talking about Bitcoin as much as possible.  He is a great ambassador for us!
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:25:31
Cats are cool :3
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:58:05
Bitcoin hero.
@_date: 2013-04-22 22:11:54
Greg Spanko is an awesome name.
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:38:01
This is great. Gives me goosebumps.
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:30:39
It would be nice to get an update on the pre-order shipments and their web wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:05:48
Fuck fiat.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:33:01
2 years? Lets wait and see how much it is at the end of this month :p
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:44:57
This is just the beginning.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:35:34
Use Localbitcoins, bitinstant, or coinbase instead of Mt. Gox
@_date: 2013-04-04 11:53:43
This is great and should be at the top of the page!
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:32:14

@_date: 2013-04-27 02:48:17
Jeff, you are the man.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:11:54
This is an annoyance for me as well.  I believe I had to delete and re-install the app, and then I was able to pair the device with a new account.
@_date: 2013-10-31 11:49:28
Guess I shouldn't have pre-ordered on the first day then.  Kind of a slap in the face.
@_date: 2013-03-21 05:02:38
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:45:26
This guy is just too calm and cool. What a great spokesperson for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:50:56
I think not only does the market cap have to grow, the userbase does as well. The more spread out bitcoin ownership is, the more difficult it should be for large swings to happen.
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:49:00
I really like this, the slogan is great imo.
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:13:15
What about a risk of tightening Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:14:40
I believe the Bronx deli isn't actually in Detroit. It's in a surrounding city in the Detroit area. Most cities in the metro Detroit area are perfectly normal and safe.
@_date: 2013-05-24 17:24:46
GOAT photoshop.
@_date: 2013-05-21 21:27:13
Sorry for the confusion, it was just a joke.  The OP misspelled the word lose as "loose" as in the opposite of tight.

@_date: 2013-12-20 05:39:19
Send a small test amount first to be sure.  Also, I believe there is a way to use bitaddress offline.  I would definitely do that.
