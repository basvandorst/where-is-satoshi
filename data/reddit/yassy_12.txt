It's during this times that you would want to buy.  Don't wait further as volatility could strike against you and for all you know it's up again.

While Bitcoin is gaining popularity over the years, you can find that a huge number of the general public knows little about bitcoin.

You trust your guts.  There's a high risk you're not going to earn anything from it and half of that is because of your understanding of how it works and the other half is purely luck.

Bitcoin is such a popular alternative investment in today's time but as much as it is promising there's also some good amount of risks involved and I believe one should first go through these risks prior to getting into any investment.  Just saying..

Btw, It's a beautiful problem. :)  I agree that it's the same way you bought it but you have to inform your financial institution about a big amount not usually coming in so it won't get flagged.

If you get anything from it then it's part of your income hence should be taxed.  Sadly, that's how things work.   But I think in some countries online earnings aren't taxed.
