no, that's not how bitcoin wallets work. bitcoins aren't stored on your phone, just the private keys. 
as long as you make a backup, you will be able to restore your wallet onto another device should you lose your phone.

i didn't say that her demands were justified. only pointing out that OP's follow up reaction was a poor way of handling an already bad situation.

I think some of the comments here are missing the big picture. OP leaves a bitcoin paper wallet as payment without explanation, assuming that the waitress would know what bitcoin is just because she is Chinese. For reasons I hope are obvious, such assumptions are highly-misinformed and even disrespectful.
On top of this misunderstanding, OP tries to physically take the paper wallet back out of her hands?? Not to say that the waitress's demands are justified, but this is incredibly cringe-worthy, and I can't offer any sympathy for OP being banned from the restaurant.

it's the same issue. exchanges like the ones you mentioned are centralized honeypots which makes them prime targets for hackers and individual phishing schemes. once an exchange is compromised, hackers potentially have access to all users' keys. a quick google will reveal that many prominent exchanges have been hacked in the past, and it's almost sure to happen again in the future. 
if you are holding any significant amount of bitcoin and/or are not an active trader, it is typically recommended to store your bitcoin elsewhere. as others have mentioned, do yourself a favor and purchase a hardware wallet.

It sounds like you're conflating overall percentage of transactions per block with wallet adoption. Unspent coins simply aren't factored in the SegWit usage rate per block. Likewise, lost coins are no longer in circulation so would have no bearing on this metric.
