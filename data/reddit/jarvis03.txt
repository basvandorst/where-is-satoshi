I thought about doing this and buying into ethereum. Already putting s huge chunk of my portfolio into it but I want more!

i think my goal is to build my stack. From a USD perspective though, if USD rises but BTC return lags on the alt arent I really losing money since I need to convert to BTC to sell anyways?

Ive been in since July and just coming around to learning to peg every alt to BTC. My question though is, does the BTC price need to remain stable in order to turn profits? I.e. lets say I bought XRB at $1 and it rises to $10. Lets say this was an 800% rise against BTC. And BTC rose from 10k to 25k. If I exchange my XRB at a 25k BTC price did I really make 800% on my XRB or no since BTC rose by 150%?

Not your keys not your coins. Robinhood owns the private key to your btc.

You can claim the loss, and the loss will offset gains in the same class (ie short or long term). If you hold btc for 5 years and sell for profit and then also sell that alt 5 years later at a huge loss, you can net your loss against your profit.

Can someone ELI5 segwit to me?
@_date: 2019-10-17 11:56:36
He’s an early investor in a lot of things. Dudes a genius. For example I think Airbnb is one.

What did we do back in 2015?
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:49:35
Was looking into the same and doesn’t seem like a possibility at the moment. Let me know if you find any methods though, have a lot of boring stock sitting in my 401k ready to make a move.
@_date: 2019-10-22 10:22:25
So there’s no long term Capital gains treatment?
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:50:42
Right but I think the proper term would be “classic computer”
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:48:30
Lol wtf is a “classical computer”
@_date: 2019-10-21 22:22:45
I’m what world/country is cap gains tax 50%?
@_date: 2019-10-23 12:21:57
Prob the same as any other commodity or stock
@_date: 2019-10-10 12:41:19
Well your tax basis is zero cuz you paid nothing to acquire it. Simple accounting here.
@_date: 2019-12-04 00:17:28
Capital loss carry forward of 3k per years so not even remotely close to this.

The order to pay on 1/8/19 would be for 2018 net income. You can’t take a 2019 loss/theft and apply it to your 2018 income.

Can someone more educated on the matter than I am explain to me like I’m 5, what I need to do with the bitcoins I am currently holding if this whole segwit/hard fork thing happens? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:21:40
Why is ripple a scam? 
@_date: 2019-09-13 22:44:09
Isn’t there a fairly large premium on gbtc?
@_date: 2019-09-13 22:46:09
You need to use a tax tracking software like bitcoin.tax or cointracking.info. You download reports from coinbase, upload to the software, and boom you have a report to use for taxes

Unlikely to drop....even after it pierced the 200 day ema? That’s bearish to me.

To be fair he ran bitinstant like a moron and that’s obvious because it led to him being arrested in thrown in jail for not having proper licensing and knowingly selling to a drug lord. Although I’d prob chalk that up to him being young and naive.
