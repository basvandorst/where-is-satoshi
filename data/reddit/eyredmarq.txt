All those advance questions were later copied to the main thread as I linked earlier at

I just want to highlight the same post from the previous [thread](
This is for the SENS foundation and their work in curing many age related diseases. See this [summary]( I found of their track record. It's very nice, but too slow, we should all help speed this up any way we can!

Great to see tipping coming back to the Bitcoin space. Will you be supporting lightning one day?
Edit: ok, just saw [this](

Yeah, Aubrey certainly stirred up a lot of controversy a decade ago. His record since speaks for itself, we don't have to take his word at face value anymore.

Great success story - are you still running your own BTCPay server? What do you think about the BTCPay third party payment solutions providers, like this [list]( Has anyone here tried them and could comment/review?
Edit: again, kudos for improving the ecosystem in general!
