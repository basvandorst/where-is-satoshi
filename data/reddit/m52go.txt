BSQ is only approved when there is sufficient evidence of *delivered* work (e.g., links to merged pull requests) that proves you earned the BSQ you're requesting.
If your compensation requests have no substance, no one will vote in your favor, so you won't be able to issue yourself any BSQ, no matter how many accounts you create.
Furthermore, as an additional check, making a compensation request is not free. It only costs a couple bucks, but that small fee should make nuisances like that unprofitable.

So many people tried to rationally reason with him and he was just not receptive...maybe he was drunk or something. Did say he was having scotch.

It doesn't matter how many accounts you have. Voting power is measured by amount of BSQ earned through completed work and/or purchased on the market.
BSQ fees are "burned"...no one gets them. The BSQ paid is uncolored and the satoshis are used as mining fees for the transactions.

Which video?

That's exactly right! Glad you got that -- I could've been more clear about it.
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:14:52
All good, looks like it was well-received overall.

Which video?
@_date: 2019-03-26 03:15:20
Yeah. That interview wasn't originally intended to be released as a video...it was just supposed to be a conversation that Ricardo would turn into a written interview, and I figured weak points could be clarified later in the text.
But afterward folks thought it was good enough to release as video, so I agreed.
Next time, I'll make sure I'm 100% clear about BSQ being bitcoin. It's (far and away) the most important point!

"The organizers" don't exist. No one in the system has elevated privileges. 
Contributors issue *themselves* BSQ for their work when authorized by voting.
Can you specify which aspect of the DAO seems scammy to you?

There still is escrow...it's just a 2-of-2 multisig now instead of a 2-of-3. 
Arbitrators have zero influence until a mediator has suggested a payout *and* one or both traders reject that payout.

Glad to hear it!

People worked for it and earned it in the exact same way...just that instead of it being managed through a DAO, it was managed on a spreadsheet.
Before that, the project received bitcoin donations from over 100 people, and those donations (along with the BSQ earned afterward, through work, as detailed in the spreadsheet above) will be used as the basis for the BSQ genesis transaction.
Everything is in the open. Documentation could be better, but your comments indicate you're either ignorant, stupid, or unwilling to understand what the project is doing. The links above have been public for a very long time. 
All our calls/meetings and proposals are public, so if you have any further concerns, please approach us directly.

Tokens are issued to compensate for *delivered work* only, not work to be done in the future. Stakeholders will not approve BSQ issuance for anything else. That's how token supply is limited.

I don't understand where the perverse incentives are. 
As I mentioned above, mediation comes before arbitration. There's no rational reason for a mediator to suggest bad payouts to drive more cases to arbitration, as the mediator would gain nothing by doing so. The only possibly outcome is bad, as users would complain about the bad payout suggestions, and the mediator would probably be removed from their role pretty quickly (and their BSQ bond confiscated).
If you're concerned about mediators and arbitrators conspiring to drive more cases to arbitration, that also doesn't make sense, because aside from the near-certainty that the rogue mediator would be outed by unhappy users (as described above), arbitrators do BTC payouts *from their own pocket* to aggrieved traders. It's in their best interest to do as few of them as possible.
With this new protocol, it's in everyone's best interest for disputes to be resolved before ever reaching arbitration, and arbitrators don't have any practical way of influencing how many disputes they end up with.

1. Bob decides he wants to contribute to Bisq.
2. Bob follows the project for a while and discovers a "dark mode" in the software is a highly-requested feature.
3. Bob does the work, and his pull request for dark mode is merged.
4. Bob makes a compensation request in the Bisq DAO for his work. He buys just enough BSQ on the open market to make his request, and includes a few plain satoshis to be colored in case his request is approved.
5. Bisq stakeholders determine Bob's pull request is a great addition to the Bisq software, and vote in favor of his request.
6. Bob issues himself new BSQ, which are the same satoshis he put in his request.
7. Bob sells his BSQ for bitcoin to Bisq traders.
Where in that process are there any trusted third parties?
BSQ to get started can be purchased on the open market without any approval. Work can be done without any approval. Compensation is approved through consensus, without the approval of any "organizers."
The only trusted third party is the GitHub maintainers, who may choose not to merge Bob's work, but that has nothing to do with the DAO.
Looking at your tone in this thread, you either sound like you have an agenda, or you've failed to understand something very simple. I can't tell, but I don't have any more time to pin-point it, and I wish you all the best. 
There are plenty of [videos]( and [docs]( to help you.

Yes, but both mediators and arbitrators are also paid for doing their jobs with BSQ. It's not clear to me why either type of contributor would purposely sabotage dispute resolution solely to try pumping the BSQ price. 
In the short term they probably won't see much of a gain from the supply cut, but they'd be risking their BSQ-earning jobs. And in the long-term they'd be hurting the network, which means the value of their entire BSQ holdings would be at risk (including, but ).


They might not want to, but they will if they have to, since it's their job. Don't forget that arbitrators are reimbursed by the Bisq DAO for any outlays they make, so ultimately they don't lose any money.
Those who can't accept the risk inherent in this arrangement of BTC-BSQ exchanging simply won't take the job. Arbitrator roles are also bonded to discourage foul play.

1. Bisq never did KYC/AML
2. v1.0 came out earlier today
3. article says something about a "new marketing protocol" which has no basis in reality
This is a low-quality article and false title.
Would love it if can correct it, or if mods can take it down. Multiple significant inaccuracies.

If you get no action on a trade, you can change your offer price for no charge, as many times as you want, until you get a taker.
