I believe the owner of the bogus pages perhaps paid a subscription fee for their "site" to be displayed at the top of the listings as an Ad. Beginners will get caught by this all day unfortunately :(

That's utterly ridiculous, what court orders may that be :/

What is going to set you apart from others who have tried and failed at this (I've seen two sites like this come and go now)?
I too have seen a couple of websites which tried and failed which inspired me to go ahead with this project. Although previous sites which have tried and failed were based elsewhere than the UK and what will set us aside is that we are a fully regulated and registered limited company, we are linked with a UK exchange and ultimately we're looking to push forward the UK adoption to cryptocurrencies.
How are you, and how much are you going to spend on marketing?
We have various advertising campaigns which will be run off "man-power" throughout January, we are also more than happy to lay out funding on the table for marketing companies / SEO specialists (as of yet no set amount has been agreed upon but we are open to suggestions at this point).
What will your fees (if any) be?
We are looking to offer seller packages where the seller will pay a fixed rate per month at which point they can sell whatever they wish (permitted it's within the allowed listings guidelines).
Will items be priced in £'s with a conversion to BTC, if so how are you going to update the prices, and at what point will they be "locked in" for the buyer, and what exchange(s) rates will you be using?
This is still undecided as to whether we should display the items in GBP or BTC. We will most probably price the items in BTC with the equivalent price in GBP by it's side in brackets. Conversion rates will be updated live alongside one of the exchanges (Also to be decided as the exchange must have GBP markets enabled).
Thank you very much for your questions :D

For now we are UK based as we would like to give UK users the chance to catch up with regard to cryptos. Although we will expand internationally within a few months of our UK launch and international customers are welcome to purchase as well.

We will have fixed seller plans in place where you can pick your seller limits. An escrow service will be imposed on the marketplace for now where buyer funds will be held in Escrow until shipping has been confirmed.

Is that a rhetorical question? Lol
