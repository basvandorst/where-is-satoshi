This is patently false.  It is always considered property, but property can be income.  It's just like if somebody pays you in grams of gold.  It's property and taxed as such, but receiving it in the first place is income.

I don't care how you choose to define inflation.  Defining common terms idiosyncratically is just play semantic games.  How much do you believe the average cost of living is increasing?
As far as TIPS go, they are a sucker's bet unless purchased in a tax-free account as the inflation adjustment is taxable income.

No, they are respected economists who surveyed the literature.  Actually read the paper (it's not overly technical or long) and follow the citations.  The academic literature on the subject is quite clear for those willing to put in the effort.

That is well within the margin of error in measurement.  Either you are stingy with your blessings or quite restrained with your insults.

That's what's called selection bias.  Obviously people who have invested in BTC startups think it's going to be worth a lot.  On top of that, they stand to profit from pumping up the value through PR.  The only real analysis I've seen is the BoAML note a couple months ago, and even with all of the assumptions that makes, they still only gave it a target price of $1300.

For starters, see  and the references cited there.  In general, that paper is a very accessible introduction to some of the "issues" people have with the CPI and related measures.
Edit: This one may also be of interest:   It compares the CPI with Europe's HICP.  You can also look into the construction of PCE and other chain-type measures for more background.  Citations available upon request.

Are Spanish beans worth less than, say, English ones?  Also, you'd be surprised at how much a hill of beans is worth.  Let's assume the hill is a low cone (you can tweak this for smoothing off the top and such), with a base diameter of 200ft and a height of 15ft (I'm assuming that to qualify as a hill it needs to be significantly larger than a "mound" or a "pile").  Then that hill would have a volume of (rounding down) 157,000 ft^3.
Amazon lists [25lb sacks of beans for $14.95]( (free shipping), and the [internet]( tells me those beans have a density of around 49 lbs per cubic foot (I'm using pinto beans since you specified that they should be Spanish).  Thus, I conclude that a hill of beans is worth about $4.6 million dollars, and that you really do think quite highly of sources.
Also, pray tell, what on earth does In-Q-Tel have to do with anything, bean related or otherwise?

I'd like a source for your assertion that M1 growth implies future inflation at that rate.

Why would you measure the cost of living against gold or stocks?
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:20:50
But all of those methods have costs, either financial or in time/energy.  Even with those methods being universally available, BPOC has effectively added a very real cost to using BTC, which should lower their value.
@_date: 2014-05-29 10:08:07
Tell me, what do you believe is the true rate of inflation?
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:17:07
That's kind of an arbitrary distinction.  Given that two things have the same utility, they should have the same dollar value (per person).  The market price is then just a function of the distributions of values people assign to possessing the item and costs involved with creating it.
Edit: This is especially true given that you have quite clearly asserted that you believe BTC price will reach several thousand dollars (unless of course, you just think BTC will remain insanely volatile, bouncing through an even larger range than we've seen thus far).  If this is the case, I'd like to know what gives you (and others similarly convinced) that BTC are really worth that much?
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:15:24
And what do you do with those BTC once you have them elsewhere?
@_date: 2014-05-05 10:53:11
How does that work exactly?  Why would the expected rate if inflation or deflation not just be factored into the nominal interest rate a la the Fischer hypothesis?
@_date: 2014-05-28 15:22:03


I'm confused:


Unless I'm very much mistaken, you're positing a causal relationship between M1 growth and price growth.


Of what?
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:06:45
And you believe that 7-8% is the long-term average?

And then go to jail for tax fraud.
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:08:27
No, I'm looking for proper valuations, preferably made by disinterested third-parties.
To answer your question, I am not holding any BTC. Nor, however, do I have any interest in shorting it.  That is because I do not have a view as to how much it should be valued at.  Had you asserted that BTC is absolutely worthless and that people would have to be stupid to pay $1 for it, I would ask you the same things.
@_date: 2014-05-28 10:05:49
A) That Time article is stupid.  There are other components to inflation besides food and clothing.
B) Yes, and?
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:44:38
You should be using transaction volume in USD (or at least in BTC).  It's the value being transacted, not the number of transactions that matters.
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:43:27
It's not perjury, "just" tax fraud.  Of course, you'd also need to file a 1040X and pay back taxes when you "find" the drive, so it doesn't really gain anything.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:03:53
That is not what the term "activist investor" means.  You're thinking of a trader.  An activist will do things like try to get their guys on the company's board to restructure the company to be more profitable (or at least enhance shareholder value), for example, by spinning off a division, initiating share buy-backs, or finding a more efficient capital structure.  It is not a reference to how actively the investor trades the stock.
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:12:11
Out of curiosity, how much do you think 1 BTC should be valued at?  Why that number?
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:42:53
Certainly, at the very least, more restrictions should not make it more desirable to own.
@_date: 2014-05-28 12:03:03
Again, source?  I take it you are unaware that most economists think that the CPI, if anything, overstates inflation.  Also, you should be using M2, the money actually circulating.
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:50:05
By "inflated," am I assuming you mean "have the supply increased?"  What do you call mining or issuing new equity?  People generally measure cost of living in dollars because that is the unit of account in which the vast majority of Americans receive their income, have their savings, and perform their transactions.  The price of gold's tumbling doesn't affect savings unless I plan to buy gold.  The value of a dollar's tumbling, on the other hand, would.
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:42:27
You haven't done the math there have you?  Assuming 7.5% steady inflation, one would conclude that in 1990:
* A gallon of gas cost $0.70
* A 1lb loaf of white bread cost $0.25
* Chicken cost $0.26/lb
* A dozen eggs cost $0.37
* A new car cost $5,000-$7,000
* A new laptop computer was $176
* Cell phone service was $8.80/mo
* A 20oz bottle of Coca-Cola at a vending machine cost $0.22
* A gallon of milk cost $0.65
* 40" televisions were well under $100
I could go on, but you get the point.
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:31:28
No.  Not at all.  Neither do USD and BMW and yet there's an analyst sitting in an office somewhere whose job it is to ask (and answer) "How much more will the car be worth (i.e. how much will people be willing to pay) if we e.g. improve the speakers?  The suspension?  Give it 20% more HP?"  I have a friend who used to literally do this with prescription drugs ("Should we invest in developing a version that doesn't require refrigeration or in one that can be taken less frequently?").  In other words, (part of) his job is to determine the price difference associated with marginal utility.
I'm assuming that people who think BTC should be worth at least $X have some sort of logic/analysis supporting that view, and since you had mentioned a several thousand dollar price target, I was hoping to hear your reasoning for picking that value.  In other words, what gives you conviction that the price will hit $2000+ and not fall to $200 (or $20 or $2)?

FWIW, 3% yoy growth would be exponential growth (and linear on a log chart), and be totally sustainable for quite some time.  Your real claim should be that 10000% yoy growth can only last a very limited amount of time.
