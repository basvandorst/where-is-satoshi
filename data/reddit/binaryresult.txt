At what price were positions settled?
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:17:47
I have not encountered this myself as I never used the core wallet, I would suggest switching to a lite wallet such as electrum if you are planning to use it from your desktop, honestly though mobile wallets handle all of my needs and are more convenient imo.  These threads may help though.

At [Disco Melee]( we have accepted bitcoin through coinbase for awhile already.  
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:48:35
Yes, it is essentially analog bitcoin, although not necessarily finite.  
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:12:11
Several mints issue gold coinage, it is marked low though because it is mainly outside of state control.  
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:07:05
Not familiar with that wallet but the easiest suggestion would just be install the wallet on your phone and send the bitcoin from the tablet to the phone.  
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:17:37
You would have the same amount of bitcoin but it would be worth more in terms of USD.  
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:35:15
After doing the fresh install I am assuming there is some sort of import wallet feature.  
@_date: 2016-08-27 23:06:10
Will be honest, I currently have WAY too much btc on my mycelium wallet, been there for over a month, plan to move to a trezor or cold storage wallet soon.   
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:18:03
Glad it helped, let me know if you have any questions.

I think your point is valid.  This is a community generated FAQ, if you feel like preparing a new chart and I would be happy to update it.
@_date: 2016-08-24 00:40:52
Glad you found it helpful.  I'm not to well versed on centralized vs SPV vs decentralized validation but I do know that Mycelium is one of the most well respected companies in the community and has been my go to mobile wallet for years, no complaints.

Fuck PayPal.  Sucks you are having to go through this but you are in the right place at least.  
@_date: 2016-04-19 12:28:06
Circle UI is pretty simple, if you can navigate PayPal you can navigate Circle.  Always smart to start with a small amount though ($5?) to get a feel for it before making large purchases.  
@_date: 2016-08-21 20:56:41
Glad you found it useful.  :)
@_date: 2016-04-22 04:26:41
Not certain if I understand the question but any bitcoins you purchase from Circle or Coinbase would be kept in your wallet on their site until you decide to move them elsewhere.  [Mycelium]( is my go to wallet for small amounts on my phone, if you have an iPhone I hear good things about breadwallet (you can't move them to your personal bank account, yet...)

I have always enjoyed answering people's questions but I agree it could provide more of a service than just instructional.  I would be ok with combining it with the weekly newcomer questions thread or simply adding a statement in the first paragraph inviting people to ask any questions in this thread.  
Edit: added a statement to the intro inviting newcomers to ask questions in the comments section, thanks for the idea.  
@_date: 2016-04-19 21:15:50
Thanks.  Hardly everything though, really just scratching the surface.  Need the help of the rest of the community to keep it updated as there are always new developments in bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:55:42
Yes you can send coins between wallets.  In order to use electrum on two different devices you would need to have your private key on each device I believe.  
BTC is only associated with a private key (BIP32 seed) which can be used to migrate coins between wallets.  
@_date: 2016-04-22 17:33:13
Download and install a mobile wallet (as I said mycelium for Android or breadwallet for iPhone are good ones), and have him send the coins to the address in your wallet.  If you acquire larger amounts a hardware or paper wallet is recommended for additional security.  
@_date: 2016-04-21 15:15:25
I would recommend trying Circle.com or Coinbase.com.  you should be able to purchase any amount from them and I believe at least one of them accepts debit.  
@_date: 2016-04-22 10:50:29
If you want your bitcoin not tied to your identity I would recommend purchasing in person with cash using either localbitcoins.com or mycelium's local trader.  Circle and Coinbase follow AML/KYC which requires them to collect personal information about you before they will sell you coins.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:35:43
Running a node it relatively inexpensive and users with enough holdings are incentivized to do so.  Of course you always want the most decentralization possible which is why the core devs chose to do conservative block weight increases and efficiency improvements to upgrade the system without sacrificing node decentralization.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:42:18
this is a nacient technology, it takes time to develop.  YouTube wasn't built on tcp/ip, it took time to add the necessary layers.  Bitcoin is in a developmental state similar to where tcp/ip was when it was first adopted.  2nd, 3rd, 4th layers are coming but they take time.  Those with patience and foresight profit.  
@_date: 2016-04-12 14:15:25
Glad you found it useful.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:38:17
A hardware wallet is the best option (Trezor or Ledger) after that software wallets like electrum.  Blockchain.info uses a poor wallet implementation and has been buggy in the past.  Do not use coinbase, they are hostile to Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:54:48
Oliver is saying Bitcoin will be replaced by another altcoin, similar to the dollar being replaced by the euro.  I think the comparison is fair.  
@_date: 2016-04-27 18:54:57
mining in general is a bad idea, cloud mining even more so.  If you want to profit off bitcoin buy it with a 5-10 year timeframe.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:31:32
Sure there are no age restrictions on open source software.  Try buybitcoinworldwide.com.  you can also buy with cash on localbitcoins.com if needed.  
@_date: 2016-04-10 21:42:40
I agree, that would be a good addition. In the meantime try circle.com, just enter a credit card and have bitcoin in 5 minutes.

Yes you could illegally avoid taxes with Bitcoin.  If it became the dominated currency taxation would be more difficult but still possible, most likely enforced through civil penalties/jail time as it is now.  It makes it harder to determine tax obligation though if you remove the banks to track everyone's expenditures. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:08:42
It totally depends on your investment timeframe.  There is no way to predict short term price movements so I can't give you advice there.  
If you are investing with a long term time horizon then it seems reasonable that the price should continue to rise until market saturation is reached due to it's limited supply and amazing utility leading to growing demand.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:58:38
Most mining is done at a loss except for the big players.  Do not use cloud mining.  
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:00:50
1) Delete coinbase and blockchain.  Install breadwallet (I hear good things but haven't used it) and the square cash app for iOs (Robinhood may work too but I haven't tried it).  
2) Buy bitcoin using the square cash app.   Withdraw $100 worth or so to Breadwallet if you want to buy something on the go.  
3) If you want to purchase any more Bitcoin then buy a trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com hardware wallet and send to it for long term secure storage.  
@_date: 2016-04-16 14:53:53

you only need to if you care about anonymity.  Otherwise just be aware that your transaction and potential identifying information is logged for eternity :)
Eventually anonymity should be integrated into the base protocol or at least the most popular 2nd layers.

depends on how many requests they have, I'm sure they will get to it eventually.  There are other options though, bitstamp is popular in europe even moreso than kraken and has less complaints on its platform.  You can see other options at buybitcoinworldwide.com

A safe place is a hardware wallet from trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com.  I have not heard of any mobile wallet hacks in the last few years.  Gemini has their own hosted wallet which is ok for short term use but you should move your coins to a wallet where you control the private keys in order to truly own your bitcoin.  Bitcoin hosted on a site is just an IOU from the site owner for your coins.  There are some recommended wallets, tips, etc. in the "Securing your bitcoins" section above.  
Coins are stored in an address (public key) that corresponds to a private key which is what is used to authorize movement of the coins from one address to another. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:16:09
Gemini is definitively lower fee than coinbase.  You could try Gdax but they are owned by coinbase and have been acting shady.  I would use Gemini personally.

There is always someone looking to sell, and if not the price rises until it's attractive enough to someone to sell.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:49:59
No, stay away, Bitcoin.com tries to trick users into thinking bcash is Bitcoin.  If you want an actual legit wallet use samourai for android.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:45:19
My understanding is that once there are enough channels the average user would never need to open or close a channel and could make payments through lightning indefinitely.  Taking coins out to the main chain would be a rarity and most likely only for large value transfers.  I admit though I only have a cursory knowledge of the system at this point and am looking forward to learning more as it rolls out and improves.  Try this for more info.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:09:54
Insider trading, refusing to implement a huge upgrade to the protocol segwit, pumping and then adding BCH trading unannounced a month before their roadmap and then pinning it to 0.2 BTC.   Pump to 9,000 right before it listed....   Very shady.  
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:26:08
Perhaps conditions have changed, I've been out of the mining scene for a few years for that reason.  Between upfront hardware costs, shipping delays, downtime, electricity bills, difficulty increases, etc. most hobby miners are better off buying coins outright.   
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:07:50
Yes, gemini is great.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:51:24
It would have to be stopped on coinbase's end.  If it has been broadcast to the network and confirmed in a block there is no reversing it.  
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:51:11
Yea but difficult adjustments could quickly make that ROI a year or more.  
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:33:35
Not sure how many currency pairs Gemini offfers but their platform is very nice.  Haven't used kraken.  Coinbase's exchange is gdax which offers several currency pairs, however coinbase has been acting strange lately so I advise newcomers to stay away from them.  Poloniex has lots of altcoin pairs so may be a good option.  Also check out buybitcoinworldwide.com

@_date: 2018-01-27 17:47:00
As long as your investment timeframe is greater than 5 years or so I think Bitcoin is an excellent buy.  Short term volatility is too hard to predict and there could be extended bear markets again.  The limited supply makes it a very attractive store of value though.  
Try square cash
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:34:15

I was only ever a hobby miner and that was years ago.  You would probably get better advice from the guys at My point was in my experience hobby miners end up with more coins if they just buy them outright as opposed to mining them.  I could be mistaken though, the landscape is much different these days.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:07:42
Transactions you run through your own node are the most private and secure.  Most people voluntarily contribute the resources for running nodes though.  
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:18:39
Yea they are equivalent.  Trezor is great. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:03:16
Avoid them, very shady recently.  Gemini.com is much better.  
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:39:57
They take that one down if something more important comes up, can only have 2 at a time.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:49:02
No the channels can remain open.   Once GUI is developed and there are several hundred nodes end user will never need to open a channel, it should be just like using a lite wallet.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:50:46
Added to the FAQ, thanks for this :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:09:23

You shouldn't use coinbase but for $10 you are probably stuck with them for now.  I mean you will see whatever percentage change Bitcoin does so if we have another year like 2017 it might become a hundred but no one can predict.

Accepted a large investment from Bitmain so are under the thumb of Jihan Wu.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:02:09
yes electrum itself is solid and many people use it all the time without issue however you need better opsec than with hardware wallets as it's on you to ensure that your computer is a safe environment without keyloggers, etc.  
Personally I would just use a reputable mobile wallet until you are securing $1000 or so at which point I would invest in a hardware wallet and use them in combination, hardware wallet for secure storage and mobile for on-the-go spending.  
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:29:55
You can generate a public key from a private key, not the reverse (and you don't need the internet to do it), that's why they are safe.

@_date: 2018-01-22 20:31:01
buybitcoinworldwide will just point you to available exchanges in your area, they are not an exchange themself.  I would avoid coinbase however if at all possible.  Gemini.com is a much better exchange for US residents.

I mean things like square cash are probably fine for that but it's not really a wallet unless you are holding your private keys, otherwise it is just an IOU for your coins from that platform so you wouldn't want to trust anyone with more than you are comfortable potentially losing.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:55:19
I see that you have 3 on chain confirmations according to that block explorer, you should be fine.  It is not showing in your wallet?

@_date: 2018-01-15 02:00:16
If they were in your private wallet you would need to manually split your coins to claim them each.  An exchange would only credit you forked coins if (1) they chose to support the fork and (2) if your coins were held in their wallet at the time of the fork.  
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:38:16
No, you can buy from an atm and send to a mobile or hardware wallet but don't use coinbase.  
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:37:16
Never heard of ICX so can't comment.  As a general rule though I think Bitcoin will eventually absorb all altcoins value and functionality.

@_date: 2018-01-31 17:17:44
But you're wrong.  
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:57:36
I would take it off coinbase to a wallet you control and continue holding for a few years then re-evaluate.  But that's just my personal opinion.  If you send it to Gdax first I think you can move it out with zero fee.

It depends on the fee you paid and the network demand.  This is a good tool for estimating fees.

Bitcoin is money, in fact it is designed to have all the best properties of money including limited supply which has caused and will continue to cause it's incredible growth in purchasing power.   Why would I trade back to something that loses value every year? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:10:20
No, not exactly.  GBTC tracks price kinda (big premium swings) but is accessible through an IRA, etc.  Futures markets are opening on the 9th (CBOE) and 18th (CME) so it's about to get a lot more liquid.  After those are established an ETF is in short order so mayyyybe mid/late 2018 and schwab/vanguard/fidelity investor can buy/sell in their 401k.

When you click buy but only if you're buying at market price.  Alternatively you can set limit orders at a specific price but they're not gauranteed to execute unless the price falls to that level.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:43:54
They do all of the above.  Coin is generated with every block and eventually miners sell some on exchange.

Hardware wallets allow you to interact with an infected PC and still be safe using your coin because all the transaction signing is done on the device which never touches the internet.

Just scan the public key to see the balance.  No risk to your funds by doing so.  You may find a trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com a easier and more secure solution though.

Nothing about my overall stance changed.  I removed a point that was open to interpretation as you seem stuck on it and not the original premise which was that cheap transaction fees are not the primary use case. 
If you want cheap transaction fees on coffee purchases there are plenty of centralized services you can (and should) choose from.

No consensus is the rules the nodes agree upon.  Bcash is an altcoin because it breaks the rules the nodes have agreed upon as to what defines Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:47:42
Depends on where the coin was at the time of the fork.  Which wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:42:57
I would recommend getting a trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com hardware wallet.  Send your coins from coinbase to the hardware wallet for safe long term storage.  
The Trezor or Ledger will handle the key management for you, all you need to do it write down your recovery seed phrase and store it safely.  
The QR codes are generally for the public "deposit" address for your wallet and can be shared freely.  People can send coins to the QR address and they will appear in your wallet.  
BTC can be spent in lots of places, see the "where can I spend bitcoins" section above.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:46:27
Yes but it was never the primary use case, it was a convenient perk before we had moderate scale.  Censorship resistant deflationary store of value has always been and will remain the primary use case for on chain transactions.

Transaction fees depend on network demand, they more transactions waiting for confirmation in a block the higher the fees.  There is limited block space so people outbid each other in order to get into the next block.  If your transaction is not urgent you can set a lower fee and it should clear eventually.  
You can send your coins to an exchange such as Gemini and sell it, then it will be wired to your bank account next day.

The hardware wallet itself costs about $100 so I would say once you have $1000 or so in Bitcoin it makes sense.  Until then you could probably use a mobile wallet just make sure you have your recovery words written down somewhere safe.

Coinbase has been doing some strange stuff recently, I am advising all newcomers to avoid the platform.  Gemini is a much better option.  Coinbase will take a fee for the purchase and the there is a fee whenever sending an onchain transaction which would have happened when you sent your coins to a different service.  This has recently been as low as $5 but if they are not batching transactions correctly it could be much higher.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:48:29
It would be in your exchange wallet until you withdraw it
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:55:17
As I said I depends on your definition, I could just as easily argue that the total supply is known and will never increase therefore deflationary.  
That is beside the point however that it's primary value function is wealth storage and not cheap transactions.

They were trying to force a fork because they claimed they needed more scaling when they hadn't even implemented the existing scaling solutions.

No, those others are alts because they forked with minimal node support in a backwards incompatible way.  
If core were to hard fork they would not do so without near uniform **consensus**, i.e. 95%+ of nodes in agreement well in advance of the planned fork date.

Gdax is owned by coinbase.  I would recommend gemini instead.   They will both ask you verification questions but they are just complying with AML/KYC laws.  Gemini is a reputable exchange, I believe FDIC insured.

If consensus were defined by hashpower then one man, Jihan Wu would rule Bitcoin and could be targeted by state actors to bend Bitcoin to their will.  That is completely counter to the reason Bitcoin as a **decentralized** system was created in the first place.  
Nodes collectively decide what is Bitcoin by the software they voluntarily run, that is consensus, not what Jihan decrees as law.  
If you don't like what the nodes have agreed you are free to hard fork as you said but good luck getting the nodes and users to follow your altcoin fork.

Personally I would just treat it as buying a treasury note that matures in 5-10 years and leave it until maturity, you can use that time to educate yourself on the long term value proposition of Bitcoin and why it is worth the investment.  Trying to trade the market is a good way for newcomers to lose money.  
For a small investment the hardware wallet is probably not justified, you can move them to a mobile or paper wallet after purchase instead.  
Paper wallets take a little effort to generate securely (you want to create them using a clean OS on a machine with no internet connection, look at bitcoinpaperwallet.com for instructions) but they offer high security.  
If you choose to use a mobile wallet you should also be fine with that amount just make sure to write down your recovery seed words and store them somewhere safe.

No that is bullshit.  
Segwit was a backwards compatible soft fork meaning all old nodes were still compatible with the new rules.  
Bcash raised the blocksize meaning it immediately broke consensus rules in a non backwards compatible way.  
All legacy nodes reject bcash blocks -&gt; altcoin
All legacy nodes accept segwit blocks -&gt; Bitcoin.

Those guys could get a job with almost any of the well funded bitcoin startups yet they choose to work with sidechains.  It's exciting, I get it, but they should not be willing to compromise the core principals of bitcoin as a network where anyone can participate.  
I realize by limited the block size their sidechains will be more desired as a scaling solution but is the profit they may be hoping for from that worth compromising principals over especially when they have so many other options?

You probably think core is intentionally sabotaging Bitcoin by not raising the max blocksize.  Like they are not personally invested in Bitcoin and don't want it to succeed.  That is just asinine.

Cold storage is only for holding larger amounts.  Mycelium entropy will make it easy, just plug it into an offline printer and it will print out multi signature (2 of 3) paper wallets with the push of a button.  Piper paper wallet printer already makes it push button easy but doesn't yet handle multisig.  Trezor is also an easy way to guarantee security for larger balances.  I'd say online use with small amounts on mobile is the best way to learn.  I would recommend installing coinbase or circle wallet for buying and selling and transferring to mycelium for day to day use.  Make sure to enable two factor authentication (2FA) wherever it is offered.
Later on once your comfortable generating paper wallets I would buy from whoever you prefer (coinbase/circle/mycelium localtrader/localbitcoins) and send directly from there to the paper wallet.

I think for now it makes sense to keep it around the 100 bit level just so more people have the chance to try it out.  Once its more established I would be ok with raising the minimum.  Microtipping/donations still has huge potential though.  Imagine paying $0.02 to get past a paywall or get rid of ads.  Also if you posted a YouTube video with 1,000,000 views if just 1% of those tipped you $0.03 that's still $300 which they can collect automatically and it becomes real money.  I bet you though if it takes off people will be tipping a lot more than $0.03 for content they like.

So many short term thinkers here.  Gox is forcing multisig security as a standard, proof of reserves, etc.   That kind of loss will not happen again because Gox was allowed to fail.  If they were bailed out and people made whole (as if that was possible) it would just be inviting the whole thing to happen all over again with the next shitty PHP hack job of an exchange or wallet.  Try to think longer term.  Bitcoin security will become airtight because of Gox and we won't need FDIC insurance and all the expenses and inefficiencies it brings with it.  The market on a whole will be optimized and much more efficient for everyone involved.

I honestly don't see why it couldn't be a more gradual transition.  Bitcoin slowly gains ground for international B2B commerce, dollar slowly loses favor.  Bitcoin slowly takes a more prominent role as a payment protocol behind the scenes to where people don't even realize they are using bitcoin for daily transactions.  By the time the dollar truly implodes the infrastructure to replace it will already be there.

I will confess I haven't made any myself (although i have seen demonstrate its ease of use).  Storing is easy though, just send coins to the public key.  For recovering funds I believe when importing a private key from cold storage your client would ask you to scan 2 of 3 keys, etc. to generate a workable key for moving the coins.  I will obviously play around with importing until I am comfortable with it before moving any serious coin.

Yes, which is exactly what I have been saying, we can still apply all of the metric prefixes to the new base unit so everyone saying how americans are corrupting the SI system really have nothing to complain about.  


We have seen the need to switch the base unit for a long time because if bitcoin's value is ever to increase into the 10's or 100's of thousands of dollars then if everything is denominated in BTC the problem of small transactions only gets worse, your cup of coffee goes from 0.01 BTC now to 0.0001 BTC as bitcoin grows.  
If we switch to uBTC now and denominate purchases in whole numbers not only does it eliminate the need to deal in decimals but the denominations actually improve over time as opposed to getting worse.  Your cup of coffee goes from 3000 uBTC now to 30 uBTC as the value grows.  


We are all just individuals with our own opinions but I would argue there are less than a dozen people (if even) who are arguably better informed about the scalability needs of Bitcoin than Gavin so I think his opinion should carry significantly more weight than most.  
@_date: 2014-12-04 19:38:35
I did it and it was very smooth over all (except for delays with the legacy banking system).  After paying the fee Broad financial registers you with the IRS and sends you a nice packet to present to the bank in order to open your trust.  
I would say I spent an hour on the phone with Broad Financial asking questions, ~$1200 paid for their services, a week later my packet arrived, 1 hour in the bank opening up the trust account, 1 hour on phone with fidelity rolling 401k into trust account, 5-7 days to sell mutual funds and transfer to bank before funds cleared meanwhile I linked the account with Coinbase, bought from Coinbase as soon as everything was finalized, moved immediately to cold storage where it has been sitting happily ever since.

I consider myself relatively tech savvy and had a casual interest in bitcoin for over a year before a friend of mine told me this was really something worth looking into.  Even then it still took me several weeks of research before I "got it" and became absolutely amazed with its potential.  I think there are still thousands if not millions of people who have a casual interest who will over the course of the next few years start to pay more and more attention as bitcoin continues to gain legitimacy.  Once people realize it's not just a flash in the pan they are going to start doing more research and there will be a lot more "aha!" moments.

How about these?
* Transaction/transmission fees for a few cents as opposed to anywhere from 2%-15% for other payment methods.  
* Bitcoin is a "push" and not a "pull" payment system.  That means no one can charge you without your consent.  With the current system you have to dispute a transaction to get your money back and if you don't notice the charge then they effectively just robbed you.
* No chargebacks for merchants.  Final payment is settled in less than ~10 minutes as opposed to credit cards/paypal which can be reversed even after several months if someone decides to dispute a payment.  
* By investing in Bitcoin you are investing in the technological breakthrough that is the blockchain which can disrupt all kinds of industries, banking / accounting / law / voting / property titles / contracts / stock issuance / intellectual property.

This is so true, I didn't fully realize it until recently but the blockchain makes it more obvious, limitless innovation and competition and the customer if free to change easily because it is all voluntary.  Businesses will compete with each other to provide the best product, lowest rates, customer service, ease of use, anything to get an edge on the competition and it will all benefit the end user.  $1 @_date: 2014-08-05 22:30:56

Pretend for a second that you are just hearing about this new currency for the first time (as a huge portion of global population will soon), you are told the primary unit of account is the bit and it is the standard by which all others are measured.  You can still apply metric notation to bits, kilobit, megabit, whatever, it works just fine.  
The only reason you have a problem with it is that you are used to thinking about a whole bitcoin as the primary unit of account and now it conflicts with the way you are using to thinking.  However, for the new user who is first introduced to this currency, starting from the base unit (yes I am aware of satoshis and they are needed as "cents" for integration into legacy accounting systems) and counting upwards is much more understandable to people than thinking of a bitcoin as the primary unit (which will most likely have a large value associated with it in the future) and dividing it into tiny fractions in order to do daily transactions.

I would start by going to your local subreddit and starting a thread offering free bits to anyone who is interested.  Those are usually well received.  
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:24:05
@_date: 2014-08-30 17:51:43
At least you acknowledge this is your hangup.  A lot of others can't admit that to themselves and instead prefer to just trash an idea which is pretty clearly better for adoption in the long run as the majority of potential users on the planet have no predisposition to BTC as the base unit and would be fine starting from bit and counting upwards instead of working with fractions.
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:16:30
I did the same thing, it was a great response, people are genuinely interested in trying it out.  
@_date: 2014-10-03 14:07:09
Why do you say that?  Transactions fees can and have been adjusted in the past.  I believe they are currently working on a floating fee with the intention of keeping it in the pennies per transaction range.   
@_date: 2014-09-01 19:46:52
The thread has been around for a lot longer and has had time to develop and attract a following.  I think expecting instant success is unreasonable and we should give it more time to mature.
I also think people are used to ignoring the sticky since it has just been the FAQ for so long.  It might be worth it to make the daily thread a regular submission at least for awhile until it becomes more established.

You're just trying to break Reddit aren't you?  Admit it.

Sure it does, because it opens up the marketplace to actual competition, otherwise why would the current services ever have the incentive to reduce fees when the could just continue colluding to extort their customers.  Bitcoin offers actual competition and they are going to be forced to adapt or die.

There is near universal agreement that we need to switch to the uBTC denomination for daily transactions so it is very likely that that amount will be what new users are exposed to first in the future.

The theoretical here is that suppose for some reason miners incentives are no longer enough to secure the network after the block reward goes away, do holders just sit tight and watch the network (and the value of their savings) die or do they choose to implement a market rate of inflation necessary to secure the network?

I believe mentioned end of the month for shipping (may not be remembering that correctly), its a different security model than the trezor.  The entropy is a usb drive that you plug into a printer and will allow you to print offline keys split into 2of3 multisig (or 3of5?) so you can store each in a different physical location (not HD).  Trezor is a HD wallet used for signing offline transactions.  The trezor is also a very attractive option for secure storage, I think either one would work well and am going to have to give it more though to see which best suits my needs.

* always inject negativity into Bitcoin discussions with sarcasm, ridicule and degradation
* always discourage Bitcoin supporters. One effective method is to repeatedly label supporters as "crazy", "loons", or a "cult". Belittle them as much as possible, to discourage people from wanting to be seen as supporting Bitcoin.
* always declare that Bitcoin is doomed to fail, to create doubt and uncertainty in Bitcoin's supporters. Remember, discourage discourage discourage

It will be a combo online/offline device.  Online would work just like a normal mobile wallet (mycelium for example), offline would be dedicated hardware only for signing transactions.  Basically imagine combining your mobile wallet with a trezor in one device.  You see issues with this?  
@_date: 2014-08-30 13:54:25
Fully agreed.  Denominating everything in the smallest base unit (yes I am aware of the satoshi) and counting up is so much more intuitive than denominating things in the largest unit and taking fractions of it for small purchases.

I like the tone and content but it could use some updating (The addition of Circle.com for example) and simplifying in my opinion.  I would probably keep it to the very basics and then provide links to more in depth topics.  I would start with;
**Where can I buy bitcoins?** - Link to Circle, Coinbase, Localbitcoins, explain you can buy any amount down to $1 worth.
**Where can I spend bitcoins?** - Link to Gyft.com, Overstock.com, Newegg.com, Coinmap.org, etc. 
**Can I mine bitcoin on my computer?** - You can mine for hobby but it will probably be at a net loss when factoring in electricity, it is only profitable to mine for large players at this point due to the difficulty.
**Basic security** - Leaving it on Circle or Coinbase is ok for small amounts but make sure to secure with 2FA.  For more advanced security and storing larger amounts link to a cold storage guide. 
Then after that just provide a single link for some of the more complex topics that covers each in more detail if they want to explore further;
* what is bitcoin?
* why does bitcoin have value?
* mobile wallets
* desktop wallets
* exchanges
* news sites
* tipping
* GitHub
* whitepaper
* the blockchain
* smart contracts
* DACs
* etc...
If they have further questions direct them to the or as a last resort the wiki.  I also think it would be a good idea to organize all the well produced introductory videos that keep being made (weusecoins, etc.) into one location as I think this is a good way for someone to get started by just loading it up on youtube and listening.  Most people learn the basics better from watching a professionally produced video than long winded reading materials, etc. in my opinion.

You dont purchase bitcoin through changetip.  If you are in the US then Circle.com or Coinbase.com are the best places to go to purchase.  Once purchased you can send your bitcoin from Circle or Coinbase to your changetip deposit address and then begin tipping after 2 confirmations (about 20 minutes).

&amp;gt; If people paid for free content all the time, why is online media struggling so much? Why are they getting sneakier and sneakier with ads if people are so willing to pay?
I guess it boils down to people are willing to pay for entertainment in order to support their entertainers whereas they want information for free.  Probably has something to do with the personal connection they feel to the individual as opposed to the corporation.  
&amp;gt; I just don't think it is a killer app (when killer app is defined as something that makes people get bitcoin cause that is only way to use app)
I suppose I wasn't thinking about the literal definition of killer app in my reply, I was commenting more on the financial support people want to provide online to causes they believe in but have no effective channel through the current system.  I do think bitcoin appeals to a certain segment of the population specifically for micropayments and ease of transfer without account details.

While I think this is awesome I can see trouble where there is a 20 person line for concessions and the person in front is having trouble with their QR scanner, entering their password, staff training issues, etc. holding up the line and frustrating everyone behind them, souring peoples impressions of bitcoin.  Fast paced concession style transactions are not the best implementation at this point in my opinion, higher dollar, lower throughput settings like the student bookstore however are a great use case.
I think something like a stadium card kiosk where you could load up a standard swipe card with like $50 in bitcoin when you enter the stadium, use for purchases while you are there and then redeem the balance later at home even through a web portal would be the best use at this point for concession style transactions.

That transaction limit could be relatively easily lifted at any time as stated by several of the core devs, in fact I think they already have the code ready to deploy but there is no need to rush to implementing it at this point as we are still well below the limit currently.  Gavin just talked about this the other day how some of the new block propagation changes he is planning to implement for O(n) will make it so any node could handle visa level transaction volume.  
Also, hashrate is way overkill for securing the network now, it could drop drastically and still be very secure against 51% attack because current pools are incentivized to cooperate according to the rules of the protocol and any new malicious actor would not go undetected.

I can say from personal experience I have had far to many times when the banks thought they knew what was best when it came to my money, what I bought with it, when I wanted to use it, how slow it was to move it between my own accounts, fees that were charged due to their own incompetence that I had to both find and spend way to much time speaking with way to many people to correct only to happen again in the future.  
On top of all this is a distrust that the 401k system will not implode and I will still have access to my funds at 59.5 which is several decades from now.  I feel much safer knowing my life's savings are outside of the control of the banking cartel and I don't need to ask anyone's permission to access them for whatever purpose I so choose.

It's the bank that wont let her transfer more than $1000/day to my account.  Rent is $1200 and they are making her split it into two payments due to their arbitrary limit, this has nothing to do with structuring which is intentionally lowering the amount of transfers to less than $10k so as to have it fall under the reporting limit to the IRS.  Maybe work on your reading comprehension and understanding of what structuring is before spouting BS in the future.

I have been wondering, why is block reward decrease a step function and not a smooth progression?  You could keep the same timescale for coin issuance but make it less chaotic in terms of price discovery related to mining profitability, etc.  
It also applies to mining difficulty adjustments, why not adjust difficulty every 10 blocks or so instead of 2 weeks so the difficulty increase is a smooth curve?  With the current method of stepwise adjustment someone (government, bank) could theoretically build a bunch of hardware in secret (maybe more than all the hardware that currently exists) and just turn it on all at once and then in two weeks when the difficulty skyrockets, take it all offline causing havoc as blocks suddenly take forever to confirm.  
Just something I've been wondering, I dont see the benefit to step function mining reward decrease and mining difficulty changes as opposed to smooth adjustments.

Changetip creates a wallet for you when you get tipped but it's only really for holding the balance that you want to use for tipping.  For larger amounts or long term storage you will probably want to go with a dedicated wallet.  Coinbase and Circle are well established and great for easy purchases of additional coins but if you want to control your private keys you should look into a wallet like mycelium or electrum.  The [sticky]( has a lot of good info.  Let us know if you have any more questions!

Overvalued / undervalued on this chart is a very short term perspective.  $30 in 2011 was super ultra mega overvalued according to this chart but I doubt anyone who went all-in during the 2011 bubble and held is thinking that BTC was overvalued today.

Yes that is the one part of his post which I disagree with.

That makes sense and I recognize that the issuance can't be changed at this point, but why has the difficulty adjustment not been updated?  As i am not a developer I'm sure there is more to it than I realize or it probably would have happened already if it was easy or beneficial.

I disagree.  It takes a lot of research to really "get" bitcoin, there are still plenty of geeks out there who would love it who are just too busy with life, etc. to do the initial legwork.  Bitcoin attracts a rare breed of Tech savvy / Liberty minded / Risk tolerant investor / Entrepreneur / Austrian Economist and a lot of people fall into one or several of these categories but haven't spent the time to really understand that bitcoin overlaps with their values.

Personally I don't really mind handing out a few bits to anyone who is interested but some ppl want you to work for them.  I would rather ppl just had them to be able to get a feel for transferring them, etc.  500 bits @_date: 2014-08-27 16:24:29
By the responses in all of these discussions it seems the majority is actually in favor of bits as the standard unit.  The end goal is global adoption and that is just not going to happen when the general public has to understand/convert/use scientific notation to do small transactions.  Bits scales easily as bitcoin grows.
It's also the psychology of it, people dont want to own a small fraction of something, they would much rather own lots of units.

I agree with this assessment, I think that's what he is ultimately getting at.  Bitcoin is anarchistic on its own and that doesn't change with greater adoption, what does happen though is the power of the state is greatly reduced with a larger network so we should make bitcoin as welcoming as possible.  People will naturally make anarchistic choices through rational self interest once given the options that bitcoin provides.
@_date: 2014-08-09 00:03:58
Makes sense, quicker to market, serves a primary need for adoption, and bitcoin isn't really ready yet to support the ad-hoc network needed for the bitcard.  Looks awesome but I would lose the location tracking.

I'm still in favor of a week where we each host a tipping giveaway thread in our respective local subreddits.  I have done these in the past and people were very curious and appreciative.  
Also, I think it is much better received when we allow people to approach us because they have an interest in learning about or trying out bitcoin in these types of threads as opposed to tipping someone who wasn't expecting it and may not have interest in taking the time to learn about it.  Plus when doing giveaway threads you can get away with much lower tip amounts (although I generally try to tip enough for 5 or so on chain transactions so they can withdrawal and practice sending it around).  
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:35:19
you are doing a fantastic job disrupting the Bitcoin community. Remember these key points:
* always inject negativity into Bitcoin discussions with sarcasm, ridicule and degradation
* always discourage Bitcoin supporters. One effective method is to repeatedly label supporters as "crazy", "loons", or a "cult". Belittle them as much as possible, to discourage people from wanting to be seen as supporting Bitcoin.
* always declare that Bitcoin is doomed to fail, to create doubt and uncertainty in Bitcoin's supporters. Remember, discourage discourage discourage
* always play down an achievement. If possible, find statistics or anecdotes that suggest the achievement is irrelevant
* insult and attack the reputation of key members of the Bitcoin community

Lots of people say they don't like bits (and I understand their reasoning even) but I have yet to see anyone suggest any alternative that seems to have widespread appeal.  Unless the bit detractors can get their act together and start lobbing the community with a suggestion that actually has mass appeal I think they should accept that the community has reached a majority consensus and go with it.

They will allow ticket sales, concessions, etc. to be paid using bitcoin at the game.

Edit:  Also, it doesn't need to be totally short range deliveries due to power constraints.  You could have a network of drones where the first one goes as far as it can, drops off the package and then then next one in line picks it up on its way to the destination, leapfrogging the package if you will to get a much larger delivery radius. 
I think it would need to be a pretty massive coordinated rollout though to overwhelm any attempt at tracking/stopping them though.  Sort of an underground production of thousands of units that are all released simultaneously across a region.

[WSJ article](  
WASHINGTON—Five global banks have agreed to pay more than $5 billion in combined penalties and will plead guilty to criminal charges to resolve a long running U.S. investigation into whether traders at the banks colluded to move foreign currency rates in directions to benefit their own positions.
Four of the banks, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Barclays PLC, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, and Citigroup Inc., will plead guilty to conspiring to manipulate the price of U.S. dollars and euros, authorities said.
The fifth bank, UBS AG, received immunity in the antitrust case, but will plead guilty to manipulating the Libor benchmark after prosecutors said the bank violated an earlier accord meant to resolve those allegations of misconduct. UBS will also pay an additional Libor-related fine.
READ THE DOCUMENTS
Plea agreements from the five banks:
Royal Bank of Scotland
J.P. Morgan Chase
The banks will pay a combined $5.6 billion to various state, U.S. and U.K. authorities to resolve the foreign exchange and Libor probes.
Bank of America Corp. will also pay a $205 million penalty to the Fed to resolve the regulator’s foreign exchange probe. Bank of America didn’t face similar action from the Justice Department.
The fines, which include penalties from the Federal Reserve and other regulators, come on top of a combined $4.3 billion many of the same banks paid in November to resolve similar charges from U.S. and U.K. regulators.
Authorities said euro dollar traders at the banks, who were self-described members of “The Cartel” communicated through coded language in an online chat room to coordinate attempts to move rates set at 1:15 and 4 p.m.
The traders would withhold bids or offers to avoid moving the rate in directions that would hurt open positions held by other members of the group, in violation of antitrust laws, prosecutors said.
No traders have yet been criminally charged over the conduct, but New York’s financial regulator said it required Barclays to fire eight employees in connection with the resolution. Investigations into individuals are continuing, according to government officials.
Lawyers for the banks are expected to enter a series of pleas in federal court in Connecticut later on Wednesday.

Citigroup, which was accused of being involved in the misconduct from December 2007 through January 2013, is paying the largest criminal fine of $925 million. The other banks were accused of engaging in the conduct for various periods with that time frame.
“The behavior that resulted in the settlements we announced today is an embarrassment to our firm, and stands in stark contrast to Citi’s values,” Chief Executive Michael Corbat said in a news release, adding its internal investigation has so far resulted in nine terminations.
The New York bank noted the settlements are covered by its existing legal reserves and won’t require a charge to earnings in the second quarter.
J.P. Morgan executives made similar comments in the wake of the settlement. The bank said the conduct underlying the antitrust charge is principally attributable to a single trader, who has since been dismissed, and his coordination with traders at other firms.
Under its settlement with the Justice Department, J.P. Morgan will pay a fine of $550 million, while the Fed penalty is $342 million. The bank has previously reserved for the settlements.
One bank, Barclays, pulled out at the last minute of the November settlement with regulators, and is now paying around $2 billion to the Department of Justice, the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the New York State Department of Financial Services, and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.
It also agreed that its foreign exchange trading and sales practices violated its 2012 Libor agreement, and agreed to pay an additional $60 million penalty.
Prosecutors said UBS would plead guilty in connection with similar violations. They said UBS engaged in deceptive foreign exchange trading and sales practices after its 2012 agreement, including by adding undisclosed markups to certain customers’ transactions in which traders and sales staff told customers there were no markups added.
One UBS trader also engaged in the same collusive behavior in the euro and dollar market, but the bank wasn’t charged over that conduct because it had obtained immunity by being the first bank to report the possible antitrust violations.
The five banks will be under a three-year period of probation, overseen by the court.

I spend a lot of time on twitch.tv and people are always supporting the free content provided by casters through tipping, usually $1-5 but they are sometimes coming in every few minutes on popular streams.  I have even seen tips as high as several thousand dollars.  This is currently all done through PayPal and its a pain having to leave the site and click through all their menus, meanwhile you are missing the action.
My points are;
1. People pay for free content all the time and are looking for easy ways to support their content creators.  
2. Changetip could make this so much easier and not require you to leave the site.  You could even tip in chat I bet for funny comments which is something you cant do with PayPal currently.

It seems to me that Karp's proposal is the same as diff adjustment.  Adjust max block size (by some yet to be determined factor) every N blocks (2016 blocks sounds nice).


Again, I see this as the same as difficulty adjustment, we cant really predict whether hashing power (# of transactions) will increase or decrease for a given set of 2016 blocks and miners (nodes) dont really have any control over it other than their individual contribution.  


While I am not a developer, [Mike Hearn's recent argument]( about how a fee market wouldn't work and would only lead to transaction backlog made sense to me.

I dont think they are trying to mine efficiently, just get a few satoshis on every device on the planet.  Those satoshis can then be used to create and execute smart contracts, etc. between devices with the true cost of the contract being settled by the users primary wallet.  The whole point of the chips is to just allow these devices to communicate contract terms with each other.

They probably cant anticipate the need for satoshis for every device, is 100 enough, 1000? 10,000?.  If it runs out, then what?  If the device is constantly generating a trickle of satoshis it will always have some available.  Also, depending on the lifetime of the device it is probably cheaper to fab the chip so it is self sufficient rather than loading it up with enough satoshis for the lifetime needs of the device.

I would advise thinking before you speak so as to avoid making a fool of yourself.  I was talking about a 1% fee on the $20 the guy was talking about to set up nodes.  There is a demand here, people want to support the network and are willing to donate to contribute nodes, if someone were to take 1% of those donations to do the legwork they have a viable business model.  Noowhere in my comment was I suggesting 1% transaction fees.   :P

Impossible to answer with any degree of certainty, there are a lot of things that can affect the price in either direction.  There is still a lot of volatility because it is still in the process of price discovery and constantly evolving.  
I personally see bitcoin as a wealth storage medium designed to gain value over time due to its limited supply combined with growing global usage and I am so glad it exists because I think it has the potential to give people financial freedom especially if they have a bit of foresight and patience.  Generally I am of the opinion that the longer your time horizon the more likely you are to see appreciation.  
However, this is just my personal opinion, you must do your own research and come to your own conclusions about what you feel is the best medium for your wealth storage (and it is generally wise to diversify and not take investing advice from randoms on the internet ;)

I think you may need to do a bit more research.  Bitcoin is permanently *deflationary* after 2140 because there will be no additional supply.  Dogecoin is permanently inflationary because more will be issued every year forever (or as long as people still mine it).  
For all practical purposed bitcoin will be deflationary after 2032 though as by then 99% of all coins will have been mined.

The hundreds of millions of bitcoin comment I can see as being an honest mistake I guess..  She was talking about gox &amp; stamp and a slip of the tongue could account for substituting bitcoins for dollars in that sentence (even though I think she legitimately believed what she was saying).  
However Stamp disappeared into thin air?  That is just false and in no way a reflection of what actually happened.  Even though you guys are FDIC insured it would be in your own best interest to not allow blatant misstatements about bitcoin exchanges just disappearing to propagate because it will probably reflect negatively on you as well.  You will still be known as a bitcoin exchange to the average investor and the implication that you can just skip town at a moments notice is probably not the impression you are trying to leave with the audience at CNBC.

I tried to enable 2FA through google authenticator with Bank of America but found out you had to use their proprietary SMS service (meh, almost as good I figured).  Nope.  Never once worked properly.  Even though I would recieve the codes on my phone I would never even get the form to enter them when I tried to login to the website, just error messages.  Cleared cookies, switched browsers, etc. no luck.  Ended up being locked out of my account 3 times after customer support claimed they fixed the issue each time.  Eventually just had to disable it because it was total garbage.  
It would have been so easy to just implement existing 2FA services that are proven to work well but they felt they had to reinvent the wheel I suppose.  So behind the curve, but my guess is its due to regulations disallowing them from using third party services.  As one commentor said in Rise &amp; Rise of Bitcoin there is no way regulations can keep up with the pace of innovation, lag times for new changes to me made through regulation often taking a year or more.  Really looking forward to all the innovation without permission.

So it is not a argument against Mark's idea.  However Mark's proposal would fix one thing that Gavins wouldn't which is the potential for  hitting the max block size and causing transaction delays, no?

It seems like they think even if its not deployed before blocks are full that fees will not rise dramatically.

That's correct however the inflation rate halves every 4 years and there is a hard cap at 21MM bitcoins.  It needs a certain rate of inflation for now to incentivize miners to secure the network and allow for a more equitable distribution however it will eventually go away entirely and be replaced by transaction fees.  Once that occurs there will be no more bitcoins issued ever again and there will still be coins lost due to key mismanagement.  
Price is governed by supply and demand and it's not unreasonable to think that price will continuously make new highs as supply is constrained and demand grows.

I respectfully disagree with your assessment.  I have been through several bubbles at this point and am used to the rollercoaster.  
The mempool is not an issue now nor will it be in the future, it you are willing to pay the market determined fee your transaction will get confirmed. Scalability will be implement because it is the best thing for the Bitcoin protocol, not as a reaction to a market downturn.  Dangerous expansion of block size will do much more to hurt decentralization and the long term value than any mempool backlog.

So you acknowledge that hardforks have risks but want to hardfork anyway to 2MB just to have to do it again in a few years because all the malleability problems still exist and we cant build layer 2 solutions?  I swear you guys make no sense whatsoever.  
is right, even if core wanted to do that 2MB hardfork a year ago there would have been more than enough opposition (from people who actually understood the risks) to prevent it from happening in the first place.  
Segwit is safe and would give better scaling than a straight 2MB HF because it enables 2MB anyway by removing witness data and also allows layer 2 through the malleability fix which could buy us years of scaling before it was a concern again.  You and your ilk are just obstructionists (if not outright attackers).

@_date: 2017-03-28 22:18:51
I'm assuming you're referring to when all Bitcoin have been issued and no more will ever be created (about 100 years away but 99% will have been issued in the next 15 years or so).  The price of Bitcoin is governed strictly by supply and demand.  If the only supply available is what is already issued than any increase in demand would lead to an increase in price.  
Since Bitcoin has several unique properties not​ possible with fiat it is not a stretch to think it will continue growing in popularity as more of the planet discovers and builds use cases for these properties.  
Of course no one can predict the future, nothing is guaranteed and Bitcoin is still and experiment in progress so don't risk more than you are willing to lose.

We all wish we had a time machine.  If I had found out about it only 6 months earlier I would probably have 5x the coins I have now.  In my opinion prices within a decade will be at least at the $10k level due to the supply constraints, the path it takes to get there is anyone's guess but the overall trend should be upwards for a long time still.  Of course don't trust what ppl tell you on the internet and do your own research especially when they benefit financially from continued adoption.

Yea circle would work fine for that purpose.  GBTC is an investment vehicle you can use in your Roth IRA that tracks the price of bitcoin to an extent.

Bitcoin is going to be a gold rush for the next decade at least, there are only so many available and the opportunity to acquire them at these prices is limited.  You sound like you are aware of the halving which happens in a month, this will be the 2nd time in bitcoins history this has occurred, and the newly constrained supply will almost inevitably lead to much higher prices (and a lot of volatility on the way) with continued adoption.  The last time the rate of issuance halved the price went from approximately $12 to $1200 within a year.  Some are expecting a similar order of magnitude rise with the next supply reduction.

That is a very broad question and relies on a number of variables (age, risk factor, technical knowledge, time horizon, etc.).  Bitcoin is a deflationary asset so it should theoretically gain value over time however several external factors could influence the price in either direction.  If you are willing to invest for the long term say 5+ years I think it could be a very wise decision however shorter time frames are much more likely to experience large volatility in either direction that could push you into a paper loss.

@_date: 2017-08-03 19:01:16


This is where I know you are not debating in good faith.  What rock have you been under for the past year and a half?  


They said this in the context that not getting segwit ever was preferable to a laughably untested solution like BU. 


If it was clear to all that SW would never activate then development would have moved on, probably with just a malleability fix to start in order to enable LN but definitely **not** a capacity hard fork.  
Segwit was worth fighting for though and it was clear that it would be able to be activated eventually one way or the other, if not BIP141 or BIP148 we would have moved on to BIP149 or other method if necessary, it didn't really matter how long it took as it was the next logical, safe and tested path that had developer consensus.  There is no logical reason to be in opposition of segwit and the devs had the correct approach of insisting that it be activated before moving on to future work which would be dependent on the changes from segwit.

If a third party holds your coins you will always be at risk of losing them if they exit scam, are shut down, hacked, etc.  Holding your private keys is really the only safe way to store your coins.  Luckily tools like the trezor or ledger make it pretty easy to have great security.

Between them I think only coinbase sells LTC, you can always trade BTC for LTC though (or usually purchase it directly) at places like shapeshift, bitfinex, Poloniex, etc.  
I have just always had a smooth experience with gemini (and for the most part with coinbase) but have heard numerous complaints about coinbase delays, cancelled purchases, etc. and only praise about gemini.  Perhaps a better comparison would be gdax (coinbase's professional exchange) and gemini but I have never used gdax.

I'll quote you again since you seem to want to change topics.  We're talking about wealth storage, which bitcoin is an excellent medium for.  It also happens to be an excellent form of money, I have no problem transacting in bitcoin and since I had the foresight to hold until I saw significant appreciation the volatility no longer matters to me.  You can do the same to store and spend your wealth and I would advise anyone else to do so as well.

You're joking right?  Haha?  
3 months is crazy reckless, especially when we are about to get a capacity upgrade that should last us for another few years at least.  There is plenty of time for a safe, well planned and tested hard fork with multiple upgrades in addition to the block weight increase.
Hard forks are a big risk and there are many other improvements that require a HF to implement.  If we are going to HF it needs to include a lot more than just a block size increase, I mean come on.

Yes, you can easily move bitcoin between exchanges or wallets.  If your coins are on gemini you would send them to the deposit address at gdax, that's it.  When you want to withdraw them to your personal wallet you would just send them from the exchange to your wallets receiving address.

Bitcoin was designed to gain value over time relative to fiat.  It does this by restricting supply while being incredibly useful so demand:supply over time tilts heavily towards price increase. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:28:43
Sounds like you're doing great.  1) I would buy the Trezor direct from trezor.io 2) you don't need to wait for it to show up before buying your coins, they can sit on the exchange for a little while just don't keep them there long term 3) Coinbase is fine (I prefer Gemini however).  4) that is correct, you would send them to the public address provided by your Trezor.  
When you activate your Trezor you will be instructed to write down a series of seed words, **this is the most important part**, make multiple copies and keep them in different geographic locations in secure storage such as a fireproof safe.  
If you ever accidently lose or destroy your Trezor hardware you can buy a new one and recover your coins from these seed words.  It's not the hardware that matters but the seed.  The hardware is for secure (airgapped) signing of your transactions to prevent any sort of man in the middle or Keylogger attack, etc.  
The Trezor would generally be considered for your long term storage purposes but you may want to keep $100 worth or so on a mobile wallet (like mycelium for Android or Breadwallet for iOs) for "on the go" spending.  
Glad you like the thread :)

When they are all mined no more can be created.  Blocks will still have value from transaction fees though.  
Bitcoin is essentially infinitely divisible which means even if every Bitcoin but one was lost forever it could still be subdivided enough to support transactions for the entire planet, it would just have enormous value.   
If a single group hordes Bitcoin they are just taking supply off the market which drives price up accordingly.

Basically everyone goes through these feelings I know I did too.  The bigger picture is that Bitcoin is just getting started and has a good chance to be worth millions someday so there is still time.  A whole coin is just an arbitrary number and you can own any amount of bitcoin you are comfortable with, down to $5 worth, the more important point is storing your discretionary savings in a deflationary medium that should far exceed the return you get from a standard saving account or mutual fund.

Gemini, coinbase, xapo are all legit.  They information they are requesting from you is to comply with AML/KYC laws (Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer).  Coinbase has some bad reviews mainly for poor customer service during times when they get lots of new users due to price rises which is understandable, I personally prefer Gemini, have never had an issue with them.  
There are anonymous ways to purchase Bitcoin with cash instead if you prefer like localbitcoins.com, mycelium localtrader, LibertyX or an ATM however you will probably pay a premium and the amounts available will be lower than if you went with an exchange.  
It's not a scam, Bitcoin is like a protocol for value transfer the same way TCP/IP is a protocol for data transfer and has huge implications because the things Bitcoin enables have never been possible before.  
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:30:29
It can currently be used for all transactions that accept Visa and more.  Things like coinbase shift card and many others allow you to convert your Bitcoin to fund a debit card that you can use for normal retail purchases (I do this currently).  In a few years the spread of lightning network hubs should make it so you can just use Bitcoin directly for these purchases without needing to convert to a debit card because fees will be very minimal.  
@_date: 2016-06-15 01:07:50
Couple points with a bitcoin "bank" like circle.  
1) they are the ones holding your private keys while you keep your funds on their site.  This means, as with a traditional bank, that you have to ask them permission to access your funds (bitcoins).  If you manage your private keys personally you don't need permission from anyone in order to move your money.  
2) banks require AML/KYC which means identity verification, alternately you could use localbitcoins.com to purchase in person without third party involvement.

You need to move the coins to a wallet you control.  A mobile wallet is easiest (make sure to write down the recovery phrase).  Once you have over $1000 worth or so you should look into getting a hardware wallet like the Trezor and keep your coins there.

I see Bitcoin becoming the defacto protocol layer for value transfer and wealth storage on the internet.  Whether or not that comes to fruition remains to be seen.

@_date: 2017-08-04 06:07:21
I think prices would fall because of how big a disruption that would be.  Block rewards are used to incentivize miners until transaction fees take over so the loss of block rewards would be bad in the short term, plus the uncertainty of what someone suddenly holding 4.5MM bitcoins might do   :O
@_date: 2018-10-25 17:29:36
I'd say +/- 10 days sounds about right
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:45:32
Coins are mined on average every 10 minutes no matter the hashing power because the difficulty automatically adjusts to keep it that way.  Currently there are 12.5 coins issued per block which is cut in half ever 4 years until the block reward becomes zero, after that point all coins will have been mined.

@_date: 2017-08-14 21:00:58
Neither blockchain nor coinbase is generally recommended for storage because you don't have control of the private keys.  Better to move your coins to a wallet you control.  The easiest and most secure method is probably a trezor or ledger hardware wallet.  I like to keep a little bit on a mobile app like mycelium as well for "on the go" spending.  
To move the coins you would send them from your blockchain wallet to the public address of your new wallet (like the one generated when you set up your Trezor).  
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:37:12

So I'm saying that Bitcoin is that deflationary wealth storage medium.  You want to park your savings in a place where it can get the best return, i.e. let your money work for you instead of the other way around.  Bitcoin is designed to grow in value over time, money in a bank saving account just loses value over time due to inflation and fees.

Exactly, Bitcoin was designed to function as a digital gold yet is easily securable, transportable and divisible so in addition to functioning as a precious commodity it also has the properties of a currency where gold falls short.

You are correct.  That's why the coinbase key no longer matters, the coins have moved to the paper wallet so only that key can move them.

Bcash was a fork off of Bitcoin that breaks consensus rules.  I see it having barely any long term value, Bitcoin has all the network effect.  Plus its larger blocks will centralize nodes and mining over time which is against one of the key principals of Bitcoin that provides security.  Also it has basically only a handful of devs, all the most experienced and competent devs have stayed with core because they follow the principles of open development and implementing improvements based on merit.

Your potential risks are risks posed by coinbase, hacking, exit scam, government crackdown on you or them denying you access to your coins, etc.  All probably minimal but worth considering.  Your bank account should not be able to be taken from coinbase but I won't say it is outside the realm of possibility.

I would recommend reading from 
Basically Bitcoin is the first implementation of a global currency independent of government and third party influence allowing for soverign control of personal wealth.  
This is only possible due to the fact that it is decentralized, all previous attempts to issue non-fiat currency were shut down, but Bitcoin is like BitTorrent in that there is no central point of failure unlike Napster.  
The fact that it is deflationary makes it an attractive wealth storage media as it is designed to grow in value over a long term timespan.  Basically scarcity is increasing while interest is as well which tips the supply/demand curve heavily towards rising prices.   
It has growing interest due to the points mentioned above in addition to the fact that you can automate smart contracts for micropayments between devices for the IoT and handle things like land title transfer, stock exchange, international payments/remittances, fractional equity ownership, etc. and people like accountants, lawyers, bankers, notaries, politicians, could all find their line of work significantly less necessary as more and more things are automated now that third parties are no longer required.  
There is much more to it, do yourself a favor and read from that link, especially anything from Daniel Krawisz.  Let me know if you have more questions.

Welcome to Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:39:31
Bitcoin supply is controlled by protocol rules, fake/extra coins would be rejected by the nodes.  
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:44:28
Just feel like you're trying pull a garzik here
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:00:05


Supply is controlled and no additional can be created beyond block reward, this means Bitcoin supply decreases over a long enough timeline due to lost coins and diminishing block rewards.  Demand is what it is, as long as Bitcoin provides incredible value (which is does irrefutably) we can expect this to increase over time.  Sure you can artificially increase or decrease perceived demand buy buying or dumping or pumping or FUDing but baseline demand is what it is, overhead supply also is what it is and cannot be changed.  If your definition is short term manipulation I will concede the point, long term Bitcoin price appreciation wins out though as supply is constrained and demand grows.  


It is backed my mathematical scarcity and security which is as cold and unwavering as you can possibly ask for.  


Many have tried but network effect is a bitch.  Essentially all of the development, all of the innovations are happening on top of Bitcoin.  Side chains and layer two will allow bitcoin to experiment with any innovation other alts bring which will cause them to wither on the vine.  To quote Highlander "there can be only one" and the winner is clear.  
I will give you that you shouldn't invest what you aren't willing to lose, that is sage advice for any position.  
Hopefully that was helpful.  At this point though I will leave with the Satoshi nakamoto quote "if you don't believe me or don't get it I don't have time to try to convince you sorry".

It's not a scam but as long as you have your coins on Coinbase they are not really under your control, you have to ask coinbase permission to access them and you are exposed to third party risk such as hacking, govt intervention, exit scams, fractional reserve, etc.  If you have them in a wallet where only you control the private keys (a hardware wallet is ideal) then they are truly under your control.

I can certainly see them attempting it however Bitcoin was designed in a decentralized fashion for the explicit purpose of avoiding influence by centralized powers.  Any GovCoin would inevitably be used to track, censor, inflate and strong-arm that populace yet Bitcoin would still remain available to all as a global alternative, free from censorship, ID requirements, inflation and manipulation from central authorities.  
Money like information, flows to the path of least resistance.  The global walls and restrictions governments want to place on the transaction of value will simply be routed around.  
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:46:46
I would buy through Gemini.  If you want other cryptos convert it on Shapeshift.  Either that or you could go with something like Poloniex that handles everything but I haven't used their platform personally.  
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:52:20
You are correct, it is that simple.  Most bitcoiners though see Bitcoin as a better long term wealth storage vehicle than the USD so they do not convert back to dollars to "cash out" but instead hold their savings in Bitcoin to appreciate and spend it as needed.   
It is very easy to buy/sell.  Gemini, coinbase, bitstamp, etc. are all good options.  
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:29:57
Coinbase will probably not allow you to make an account with fake info.  If you wish to but coins anonymously try localbitcoins.com or LibertyX or an ATM.  
Coinbase is a legitimate site but they follow AML/KYC

Dont have any specific crypto recommendations but price doesn't matter only percentage gain.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:32:42
If that is how you wish to use Bitcoin then yes, it can function like that.  Best time to buy is nearly impossible to answer.  If you want my personal opinion I think we still have a ways to go on this run so any pullback like the one happening now is a pretty good opportunity for an entry.  However there is no guarantee that this is not the top and we are about to go into a bear market.  
You need to do as much research as you can and try to make your own informed decision on bitcoins long term value.  I think you will be much more likely to come out ahead if you are looking at it as a long term wealth storage vehicle instead of a stock to trade in and out of quickly.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:42:39

@_date: 2017-01-19 02:43:23


No one needs to apologize, there are no rules to how you can use bitcoin, if there were it would be broken.  Whales bouncing the price back and forth attract more traders looking to scalp who increase liquidity and spread the word to larger traders who in turn increase the market cap.  Bitcoin will never achieve global saturation without volatility, it's impossible to go from 0 to 100 in a nice smooth adoption curve.  
@_date: 2016-12-28 17:53:03


If your funds are in a pre-tax account like a traditional IRA or 401k would it not make more sense to convert it to a post tax account so you don't owe taxes on future gains?

Bitcoin is by far the most accepted for retail purchases, the others are mainly used for speculation.  
@_date: 2016-12-24 21:00:26
ATM should work, the fees are usually a bit high though.  You will probably need your ID, cash and a way to display the QR code for your wallet (didn't realize they made wallets for Kindle but that should do it).  
Not sure what you're referring to about instantly vs ages.  When you are waiting for a third party to broadcast a transaction (like the ATM company) it is really up to them when they broadcast it to the network.  Once it is seen by the network though it should be included in the next block (~10 minutes) assuming it had the appropriate fee.  
Also not sure your question on %, I'm assuming you are referring to the % markup from the ATM operator?  This is just their fee for their service.  LibertyX is another good option to buy Bitcoin locally with cash and has less fees than most atms I believe.  
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:45:04
Better solution, just don't deposit your wealth in the banks.  
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:17:45
I would have them use [LibertyX]( (they also have apps) should be more convenient and less expensive than an ATM.  Once they have the bitcoins in their wallet they would just send them to your wallet address, in fact they could probably just specify your wallet address in the first place for the deposit and skip a step.  
Alternatively the method you laid out for the ATM should work.  Localbitcoins.com is also an option.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:05:04
Yes that should work.  Be aware there are fees and confirmation times with each transfer though.  
@_date: 2016-12-16 18:31:49
Personally I use their solo 401k and am the sole custodian of the funds.  Bought coins, hold my private keys.  You can purchase property, gold, etc.  Currently considering converting it to a IRA so all gains are post tax, wish I had done it a year ago actually.  
@_date: 2016-12-12 14:18:55
Easiest way to purchase is probably coinbase.com.  Start there and let me know if you have any questions.  Once you have it, find something you want to buy that is for sale for bitcoin.  You should see a QR code at checkout.  Scan it with your coinbase app and send the requested bitcoin.  That should be it.

If you were still expecting Bitcoin to experience 1000% growth over the next decade would it not make more sense to convert it to post tax money (Roth conversion for example) so you don't owe tax on the gains?
@_date: 2016-12-16 06:04:17


What's the point?
Edit:  Maybe the are publishing a daily hash of all the transactions on their private chain transactions to the bitcoin blockchain?  I could see that making their private transactions cheaper and faster and preventing blockchain bloat.  Still dont see why you would need to run it as a private blockchain though instead of just a database.

It was more than just the double spend problem, decentralization was also crucial.  Any centralized currency that threatened the states monopoly on issuing money would be shut down.  A decentralized ledger made that exponentially more difficult.

1) As I said, segwit will give us scaling which should last a few years so there is no rush.
2) No one is ever really willing to answer the question of **why** we would only include a block size increase [when there is a host of other wish list items that devs have been wanting to implement which require HF](
So not only is it currently not needed (and dangerous since it would be contentious) but it is missing all the other improvements devs have been waiting to implement.  
Why again is this being seriously (*eyeroll*) discussed at this point?  Thankfully the core devs are not so easily swayed by the noise.

No, the answer is that segwit is the first priority because it is the next logical progression, all those other things will become a higher priority once segwit is active.  
We cant start working on that hard fork while simultaneously fighting to activate segwit because the nature of the fork and all the variables that need to be considered change once segwit is live.  You fork from your present state, not some future state of the network that was not certain to exist.

I think this was your first error in judgement.  It would be more accurate to think of Bitcoin as a protocol.  The simple way to think of it is a value transfer protocol similar to how TCP/IP is a data transfer protocol but it is actually much more than that, it is closer to a truth protocol when everything online is easily falsified and duplicated.  
Once you have a mutual agreed upon record of truth you can use it for a multitude of things such as land/property titles, voting records, deeds, commodities, etc. in addition to money (which takes a long time to become universally accepted due to network effect).  In the mean time it serves as an excellent value store (with the standard qualifier that you should not invest more than you are willing to lose as it is still an experiment in progress) due to its limited supply and resulting deflationary properties as opposed to inflationary government currencies. 


It is worth what the laws of supply and demand say it is worth, nothing more or less.  


This is incorrect, many people are using it currently as an excellent store of value (see global local bitcoins volume charts).  Currency function comes later.  


It is easy to see it as a bubble if you don't recognize it for what it really is, the first global agreeded upon ledger for truth upon which everything can be built, including currency.  When you understand the limited supply function you realize it is still grossly undervalued.  


Again, don't invest more than you are willing to lose, it's an experiment in progress, nothing is guaranteed and you need to understand how to properly manage your coins.  That said I personally think it is an excellent investment and have staked my position accordingly.  
Feel free to ask any additional questions.

This is bullshit.  Bitcoin first has to be secure before it can become a currency.  A larger block size would jeopardize bitcoin's very existence. 
Layer 2 solutions are the way to scale to microtransactions and low fees while maintaining security, which is exactly what the devs are looking to enable with segwit.

@_date: 2016-12-22 13:25:10
Probably more related to the reduced inflation from the halving kicking in (less supply on exchanges) combined with a general overall global growth in popularity (increased demand, see local bitcoins charts).  Sprinkle in some media hype and FOMO (especially with larger forex/hedge fund players) after the ATH and you have the recipe for the biggest bubble yet, possiblly making 2013 look like a little blip (that's not even mentioning the ETF).   Also, new supply isn't getting any easier so I think it's going to last for the better part of the next few years, we are only at the beginning.  Just my theory though.

Currently holding coins in a self managed 401k and considering a Roth conversion.  Makes sense to me to pay taxes on it now so it can grow tax free but I'm still not convinced it wouldn't make more sense to let it grow pre-tax and pay taxes on the gains down the road especially if I am planning a sort of Roth conversion ladder once I'm 59.5.  Any thoughts?

Sure it is, volatility should be orders of magnitude less once we are at full saturation.  Global GDP oscillations will be minuscule in comparison to total money supply vs bitcoin's current nature where any large market order can move price by 10% or more.

These are very intelligent questions and I will try my best to explain. 


Mining centralization is a real problem and ongoing concern however miners are only one element of what defines the bitcoin network.  Nodes, users, merchants and developers are the other components.  Right now centralized mining and centralized merchants (segwit2x attack) are going against decentralized nodes, decentralized users and decentralized developers (Bitcoin).  
While mining power is centralized the consensus of nodes defines the rules of the bitcoin network and that is why the developers are so staunch on their refusal to do an unnecessary, untested, rushed and reckless change to consensus rules with segwit2x, because if miners can overrule developers and increase the blocksize at their whim it would set a dangerous precedent that would eventually lead to node centralization in server farms.  
I am confident they will be defeated and miners will finally accept that their role is to receive payment for processing transactions that are valid under current protocol rules and not dictate protocol rules.  As long as users stay with the chain that is operating under consensus rules it will always have the higher price and miners will be forced to mine on it in order to stay competitive with each other.  Those that refuse will find themselves losing market share to those that do and majority mining power will continue to perform work on the chain with valid consensus and as such mining centralization is less of a concern due to bitcoin's inability to be co-oped by centralized entities.  
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:40:07
Yes from exchange to bank account. You would pay capital gains tax.  
@_date: 2019-02-06 16:57:08
In my opinion it was very intentionally designed to enrich the money printers at the expense of the wealth and purchasing power of the general populace
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:14:51
B2X has refused to implement basic replay protection so splitting your coins is not easy.  Some exchanges have announced they will split for you but that requires you to store your coins with them at the time of the fork which has added risk.  There are also tools being developed which will split your coins for you but none currently available that I am aware of.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:21:03
You should put your money where you think it can get the best returns.  If you think that is in alts then go ahead but I think some of your assumptions are flawed.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:13:36
here are some good vids
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:04:29
If bitcoin continues on it's long term exponential growth trend and just reverts to the mean it would be at something in the ballpark of $500,000 before correcting but possibly much higher.  It could also crash to $2000 tomorrow, there is really no way to predict short term prices and you can expect a volatile ride along the way.  
Bitcoin has a lot of long term potential though and shouldn't be going anywhere because it is a decentralized open source protocol for value transfer that is only beginning to have applications built on top of it, we are still in it's infancy so plenty of room to grow (still an experiment in progress though so the potential for total failure is non-zero and should be taken into consideration when investing).  
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:19:27
You should be able to use the seed to recover your funds in any BIP32 compatible wallet.  Yes controlling your seed is controlling your coins.  
@_date: 2019-02-09 04:41:46
The system cant be fixed from within, this is the reason bitcoin exists.  
@_date: 2015-08-07 03:17:35
How about a link?   
has some good info at least
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:32:35
Bitcoin is just governed by supply vs demand.  Supply is capped (although bitcoin is currently still being distributed in the form of mining rewards), however demand is essentially unlimited, as word is spreading about bitcoin's usefulness demand grows forcing the price upwards.  And yes, if you had held onto that 1 BTC from $5 it would now be worth ~$7100
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:12:53
Yes, the only question you need to ask yourself is if you would rather keep that money in a deflationary asset that has shown to grow in value over a several year timeframe or an inflationary asset that decreases in purchasing power year over year.  
Of course fees will make up a bigger percentage of low dollar value purchases but returns have more than made up for fees historically.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:16:48
Leave it in coinbase until you get $100 or so to minimize the fee percentage then transfer it to a mobile wallet like mycelium for android or Breadwallet for iOs.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:04:27
I like trezor
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:45:28
Both.   It will do the job but there are better wallets.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:13:49
Sure thing  :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:00:33
Depends, look at fees as compared to time to your account etc.  I have had wire fees waived in the past.  It makes more sense for larger purchases.  
@_date: 2019-02-05 14:57:22
Read [The Bitcoin Standard]( by Saifedean Ammous, it's a great introduction to bitcoin's deflationary "hard money" properties.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:00:11
Yep, you should be able to send coins wherever. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:58:11
Well you wouldn't want someone to get access to wallet.dat for example but I avoid that by not using desktop wallets.  Just a mobile wallet and a hardware wallet.  You need better opsec if using a pc.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:42:31
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:47:46
I'm sure if they allow custom fees yet.  They're also not using segwit addresses yet so fees are higher on their site.

@_date: 2017-11-29 05:20:37
not sure the exchange requirements, probably 18+.  You could still buy/sell p2p with localbitcoins.  Electrum is a good wallet.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:15:01
That's correct, you can buy as little as like $10 of bitcoin (due to exchange minimums) but bitcoin can actually be subdivided down to fractions of a penny.  
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:13:44
A small amount is ok on an exchange but in general you want to transfer to a wallet you control even if it is just a mobile app on your phone.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:17:14
17 trillion. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:54:02

Very hard to say;
* PPl buying coin before the fork to get free fork coins.
* Resolving uncertainty about how the fork plays out -&gt; price increase
* Could be severe network disruption for weeks or months. 
* If the fork succeeds it will mean bitcoin has failed and is now under the control of bank, governments and corporate interests and will be eventually centralized and controlled or shut down.  
These are just my thoughts though so take with a grain of salt.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:14:57
I would transfer it to a wallet you control.  Start with a mobile wallet (mycelium for android or breadwallet for iOs are good).  Once you have over about $1000 worth you should invest in a hardware wallet like trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:14:44
Depends on how much you are talking about.  Under $1000 sure that's probably fine, over that I would transfer to a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger.  In general best practice is to transfer them to a wallet you control.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:00:57
I believe you can trade but are not able to purchase coins with yuan at the moment but I could be mistaken.  I am not certain, I would inquire with one of the exchanges listed on buybitcoinworldwide.com

You will always need a fee in order for the miners to select your transaction from the mempool.

probably just delay, check with gdax support
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:49:30
did you set a custom fee?  It should clear eventually but it may take awhile.  
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:22:41
Unless you can just go gdax -&gt; hardware wallet.  
They would be separate wallets.  Only keep in your phone what you would feel safe to keep on you in cash.  Transfer more to the phone as needed from hardware wallet.  
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:30:44
Try bitfinex or Poloniex.  Also buybitcoinworldwide.com
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:07:35
When creating a wallet you should be prompted to write down a string of 12 to 24 seed words.  This is your recovery in case of hard drive failure, house burns down, etc.  You would just install the wallet software on a new computer and then enter your seed phrase to restore your wallet.  You only need to protect the seed words for recovery.  
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:12:12
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:26:09
You are pretty much right on all points.




This is a good choice but a bit more difficult to set up securely, for example you probably want to boot from a clean linux usb on an airgapped computer and then use a html file of bitaddress.org to generate your keys and print them off on a new printer (or at least one with no internet connection or hard drive).  A more simple but slightly more costly solution is a hardware wallet like trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com.  


It is generally recommended to split paper wallets into multiple denominations so you only have to redeem as much as you need at the time.  You need to sweep the full amount of the wallet when you redeem it as you are exposing the private key to the internet in the process which open you up to attack vectors such as MITM attacks or address substitutions if you are using an infected computer for example.  


That is all correct.  The public key is safe to share with anyone, the private key you need to protect however and never expose it to the internet until you sweep the funds.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:27:47
Coinbase is a good starting point.  Also buybitcoinworldwide.com
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:46:28
the amount doesn't matter.  technically any sale of btc or purchase with btc is taxable as capital gains.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:50:32
I agree for the most part.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:11:29
You can have QR for public or private.  Generally you would be seeing your public QR unless you were sweeping funds from a paper wallet for example.  
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:19:04
Bitcoin will theoretically stabilize and slowly grow at market saturation, that can happen before all coins have been issued however.  Whether that is just niche use case or global money supply remains to be seen but it is proving itself over time to be sound money.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:00:42
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:26:59
If it was me I would just invest in btc and forget the alts.  BTC is the standard, the platform for innovation, any useful altcoin priorities will be incorporated into bitcoin, as such I think the long term value of alts is essentially zero.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:12:13
@_date: 2015-08-31 18:43:48
Agreed.  Just look at one of the many comments from the developer on the scope of the project.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:17:24
I believe so.  You're not screwed as long as you have your seed words from your hardware wallet initial setup.   
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:11:33
Just read the resources in the guide above.  Bitcoin has the most developers, nodes, exchanges, merchants, user base, market cap, venture funding, etc.....  
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:13:32
You only write down the seed phrase the first time you create the wallet.  You can then transact as normal with the wallet forever essentially.  You would only use the seed phrase if you ever needed to recover the wallet because you lost access to that computer somehow (theft, fire, hard drive failure, etc.) and needed to recover it on a different computer.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:56:36
This should have what you need.   
Nah, dont mess with blockchain.info, you can send them straight from coinbase to the paper wallet.  If you are willing to spend a little bit you might consider a trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com as a more simple and secure solution.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:18:11
I would get a mobile wallet for on the go use and a hardware wallet like trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com for long term storage.

I believe they raise your limit as you build a purchase history or submit additional ID documents.  You may have to hit the $2k limit first though, not sure.  You can try gemini instead, they will take wires in any amount essentially (I think coinbase and Gdax will too though).  also buybitcoinworldwide.com

I see, yes there are services that will watch you cold storage addresses for you and keep track of the balances, I know mycelium does this, not sure which others but it's fairly common.  As far as generating new addresses from a public key I'm not sure, have never tried it.  Try some of these. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:21:51
It's the built in browser
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:22:38
sure, all transfers have a transaction fee, coinbase may have a fee ontop of that as well but I dont think so.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:11:58
It should be the market price at time of order.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:46:46
Well a hardware wallet would prevent that.  The choice still remains, do you store your savings in an inflationary or deflationary currency?
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:14:40
1) Airbitz is good
2) It varies depending on network traffic.  Sometimes as low as 25 cents or so, sometimes as high as $5
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:09:26
If your coins are in someone else's custody and they then get hacked, run an exit scam, shut down by govt, go out of business, etc. there is no guarantee you will see them again.  
If your coins are in a wallet where you control the seed then you move it to another wallet even if the original wallet goes out of business because BIP32 seeds are cross platform.  
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:29:01

Sure, look at the "earning bitcoins" section in the OP
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:50:05
No deflationary currencies (Bitcoin, gold) generally gain value over time because they are limited in supply.  Inflationary currencies (dollar, euro, etc.) generally lose value over time as more and more is printed.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:12:01
You can store them in a personal wallet indefinitely.  The reason people recommend you move your coins to your personal wallet from the exchange is when your coins are on exchange you are exposed to third party risk and you essentially have an IOU from the exchange for your coins.  When they are in a personal wallet they are under your control.  If you want to convert between dollars and bitcoin you need an exchange in either direction, that cannot be done from a personal wallet.  
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:24:47

We wont reach the 21M coin limit until sometime around 2140.  [See here](  Bitcoin is sustainable even after all coins have been mined due to miners receiving transaction fees for their work processing transactions.  If anything once all coins have been mined price should increase because there will be no more downward inflationary pressure with new coins being issued.  You can invest any amount into bitcoin, as little as $10 worth (due to exchange minimums) and can actually break bitcoins down into fractions of a penny.

Microbitcoin is listed as well as bits in the table right above the example transaction you reference.  In that example, SI format is listed with "20 mBTC" as well as the colloquial/slang terminology of "20,000 bits".  This is not some mod scheme to push bits on users, it should be [fairly apparent]( that it had gained at least [enough support]( to be endorsed by prominent entities in [the community](


Why don't you roll up your sleeves, give it an edit and find out for yourself instead of automatically assuming conspiracy?  
To be clear, I am not going to include just any edit.  I want to keep this as an easy to understand introduction for total newbies (think backpage) and I admit it still needs some polish to get there which is why I have requested and appreciate feedback.

I remember feeling the same way after hearing [Chris Odom]( speak about Open Transactions.  I can tell we're at the very edge of achieving an unstoppable permissionless internet and it is a very exciting prospect for me.  
FYI, I have no affiliation with MORPHiS other than being a passionate supporter.  :)

I plan to clean it up a bit in the next few weeks but in the meantime I would love your help to make it the best it can be so if you have any suggestions at all please let me know or feel free to [edit it yourself here]( (just click edit at the top) and I will incorporate the changes in the next revision pending review.  Thanks!!

How do you make sure what's there?  In the future if you wanted to sweep the funds out of the paper wallet you would import the private key for the paper wallet into the software wallet of your choice.

In general no one can predict the future price (although we can make reasoned assumptions and I guess that's what investing is all about anyway) so in the end you have to educate yourself and make what you feel is the right decision.  Bitcoin is difficult to understand initially but fortunately there are many educational resources available and I have tried to curate some of my favorites into this FAQ.  
*The following is only going to be my personal opinion not investment advice.*
Bitcoin's price is governed by supply vs demand, in bitcoin the supply is limited to 21M coins yet demand is essentially only capped by global money supply.  Bitcoin has many unique and useful properties that current fiat money and banking system are not capable of which makes it valuable.  Bitcoin is an open source protocol for global value transfer which can be improved upon and there are several exciting upgrades to bitcoin underway (not to be confused with the segwit2x attack currently ongoing which is **not** an upgrade).  
Because bitcoin is so versatile it is considered by many as the new internet of money upon which countless applications can be developed.  People see that long term potential and the limited supply and make the reasoned assumption that if people continue finding it useful then demand and user adoption will continue as well, so as demand grows price increases due to limited supply.  
Bitcoin was designed this way as deflationary money that could not be shut down as direct competition to the inflationary fiat currencies in use today that lose purchasing power each year due to money printing.  As such I made the personal decision to store my wealth bitcoin to the extent that I am comfortable with and have been very pleased with that decision up to this point.  I also do not intend to "cash out" but instead let my bitcoin grow while only spending as much as I need to for living expenses, etc.  


Bitcoin will most likely face several challenges in its future and the possibility that some fatal flaw is discovered that crashes the price is non-zero even though it seems to diminish every year it has run reliably in a very hostile environment.  That is why most people conservatively advise you not to invest more than you are willing to potentially lose, bitcoin is still an ongoing experiment the likes of which the world has never seen.  Personally I would not recommend investing in bitcoin with less than a 5-10 year time horizon and go into it on the understanding that it will either be worth a multiple of its current price or nothing at the end.    


ETH seems like a nice toy at the moment but has several problems to the extent that I don't want to touch it, the best bet long term imo is just bitcoin.  ETH's main selling point of smart contract capability is currently being developed for the bitcoin network as well so ETH's competitive advantage on that point should be negated soon.  If you want to diversify a bit litecoin or maybe monero seems like the best alternatives to me right now.

Alts are probably not worth your time.  It's not too late, bitcoin has only been around for 8 years, it's still in its infancy.

1. Yes you can use limit orders when entering and exiting a position.  You could exit 1 minute later or several months later, up to you.  
2. BCH is a scam, stay away.  
3. Wait time averages ~1 hour for 6 confirmations if transaction fees have been set correctly.  You could sell coins that were in your wallet within an hour and have the dollars wired to your bank account the next day.
4. I don't think they send dollars to another exchange only a linked bank account but I could be mistaken, never tried.  You can easily send coins between exchanges though.

@_date: 2017-11-16 15:53:23
Moving your coins using an on chain transaction can sometimes have a relatively high fee (~$5 or so) depending on network traffic and your need for a fast confirmation.  Usually this is due to someone spamming the mempool as an attack.  Transfer between coinbase and gdax would not involve an on chain transaction so would be free.  The exchange may have hidden the fee from you for the transfer to your wallet but they paid a transaction fee to get it included in a block.  If you were to send from your wallet back to the exchange or between wallets there would be a fee.

If they offer a buy feature it is legitimate.  It is secure as long as you have written down your seed phrase.

An instantly global transportable, non confiscatable, pseudononymous programmable digital asset of limited supply has enormous value to the world.  Whether extremely wealthy and looking to shelter money, extremely poor and looking to avoid hyperinflation, or just a merchant looking to do global trade without the delays, fees, and regulations of middlemen, bitcoin has broad appeal.  
To determine the price for an apple you simply transact at whatever the value of bitcoin is at the moment.  If there were no reference point to fiat then the apple would be valued at whatever amount of bitcoin people were willing to pay for it.

There is no telling if the price will drop after the fork.  If bitcoin is able to deflect this S2X attack then the price could catapult, no one really knows.  Personally I would rather have coins pre-fork because then you get free post-fork S2X coins that you can sell for more bitcoin.  This is more difficult than usual though because they are refusing to implement basic replay protection which would result in duplicate transactions on both chains and potential loss of funds if you tried to move your coins without splitting.  Luckily tools are being worked on by some of the core devs to make splitting a relatively simple process.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:49:28
Many people use them.  You can try buybitcoinworldwide.com or localbitcoins.com for more options.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:27:41
that's correct.  I dont even use the wallet file per se, just the wallet GUI.  My setup is mycelium app installed on my phone for a small balance of "on the go" spending and the majority of my balance secured in a hardware wallet with the seed phrase stored securely in different geographic locations in fireproof safes.  I only use my mobile wallet for transactions and if it's running low I top it up from my hardware wallet but otherwise I just let the funds in the hardware wallet sit long term.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:49:44
Unfortunately mining is very centralized right now and they are using that influence to try to gain control of the protocol with the S2X attack.  Fortunately miners are not the only players in the game, they have some of the big merchants on their side (probably bought) but they don't have any core developers and only a tiny fraction of nodes and  users.  
Nodes decide the rules of what is Bitcoin through software people run of their own free will, miners are trying lots of tricks to try to force nodes to accept rules they don't agree with but I think in the end they will fail and finally accept that their job is to process transactions for a fee and not dictate consensus rules.  
Coins are issues to miners after having found a block of transactions which complies with the rules that the nodes agree on.  Nodes are decentralized across the planet and the big reason that the core developers are reluctant to raise the blocksize until other more obvious scaling solutions have been implemented it to keep it easy to run a node so they don't get centralized in data centers where they can be easily shut down.  
Miners don't seem to really care about centralization or long term viability of their business model, just short term profit which is really short sighted imo.

1.  The purchasing price of bitcoin has generally risen over time so you just buy it and hold it until you need to spend it.  I generally dont recommend investing with less than a 5-10 year time horizon though before re-evaluating.  
2. You can buy as little as $10 yes but the small the buy the greater percentage you will lose from fees.  
3. try buybitcoinworldwide.com
4. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere since it is an open source distributed protocol.  We are all still early adopters at this point.  And plenty of time left for it to grow if adoption continues.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:47:20
Sometimes the network gets spammed which drives up transaction fees.  You can still set custom fees with certain wallets but some big companies don't let you currently as customize your fees.  It usually doesn't last very long.

There is a non-zero change that bitcoin can go to multiple millions of dollars.  In fact I am personally betting on it, in my opinion any buy below those prices is a good one if you have a long enough time horizon.  
I would suggest just starting small, $100 or so on coinbase and get comfortable moving your coins to your personal wallet, maybe buy a steam game, or something off newegg, overstock, etc. to get a feel for making transactions.  
If you feel good managing your coins then set up a recurring buy on coinbase for whatever you are comfortable with and then move the coins to a hardware wallet like trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com for long term storage.

@_date: 2017-11-01 23:13:09
Hardware is better in my opinion, the vault just makes the process of moving your coins more difficult for both you and a potential thief by introducing time delays and additional verification, etc.

@_date: 2017-11-03 11:51:55
1) If your coins are in a wallet where you control the private keys pre-fork you will have both coins post-fork.  You will need to use a splitting tool like the one currently under development by some core devs.

For anonymous purchase you would need to use cash.  Exchanges have to comply with AML/KYC laws which require identification.  Some cash options are localbitcoins.com, libertyX, ATM's, etc.  They all have different fees, etc. so you have to do your homework.  The cheapest way to buy is probably sending a bank transfer to an exchange and using limit orders.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:52:23
Yes, coinbase will require identifying information to comply with AML/KYC laws.

No your Bitcoin is fine, that is an old unsuccessful fork that doesn't effect you.  Bitcoin cash is another dogshit fork that is run by a con artist and will also shut down eventually.  There is only one true Bitcoin, the one that is maintained by core developers and achieves network consensus.

Then miners will be rewarded with transaction fees instead of new coins for their work processing transactions.  Also the price should continue climbing because there will be no new supply and the supply demand equation should tip toward the demand side.

Predicting the short term price is a traders game where most lose money.  The best proven strategy is to invest with a 5-10 year time horizon because we can make much better predictions about the prediction of the price in the long term.  On a day to day or week to week basis only a few large players can move the price by hundreds of points with a single order so trying to predict short term price is just guessing.

First off $8000 - $300 = $7700 not $7600.  
$8000 = 1 BTC (in your example)
$300 / ($8000/BTC) = 0.0375 BTC spent
1 BTC - 0.0375 BTC = 0.9625 BTC remaining.  
0.9625 BTC * $9000/BTC = $8662.50
$8662.50 - $8000 = $662.50 profit.

Yes you could use blockchain although I think there are better alternatives.  You should only withdraw funds from a paper wallet one time, sweep the entire balance to your wallet and then never use it again.  You would then need a new paper wallet for future storage that has not been withdrawn from (this is why ppl recommend that you generate several paper wallets at once and load them with various amounts).  
I would consider investing in a trezor once you are protecting more than $1000 worth or so.

General advice is to only risk what you are prepared to potentially lose, bitcoin is still an experiment in progress although every day that goes by solidifies its use case as a store of value.  I generally say invest in bitcoin with a 5-10 year time horizon and expect that it will be worth nothing or multiples of it's current price at that end.

It's not always that congested and some services let you set the fee which can be as low as a few cents.  I don't think coinbase let's you set it though, they want fast confirmations.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:23:07
I'm not sure I understand the question.  You mean once its all issued will it still be rising?  It depends on when it hits global saturation which is basically the only cap on potential price.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:17:06
For that amount I would definitely get a hardware wallet.  
Trezor.io or Ledgerwallet.com are the two best.  
As a general rule you do not want to keep any significant amount on exchanges and instead move it to a wallet you control.

To an extent.  The blockchain is just a virtual ledger that is distributed globally among all nodes.  That ledger is essentially an excel table that has Column A (Address) and Column B (balance).  The private key to an address gives you the authority to move the balance in that address to a different address.  
A wallet is just a GUI for accessing your address and storing your private key.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:11:53
I would just be randomly guessing if I were to try to tell you what the price will do over 100 years from now.

@_date: 2017-11-14 16:13:13
ledger and trezor are both solid choices.  You would send to the public address for your hardware wallet once you have set it up.  I like mycelium app on my phone (android) in combination with the trezor wallet.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:27:28

It's all about percent return.  Bitcoin is the standard upon which everything will be built, any innovation that alts provide will eventually be added to bitcoin as a layer 2 or sidechain.  As such all alts should eventually trend to zero over time.  Bitcoin however should continue growing until it has reached global saturation.  You can ride a wave in an alt and make a lot of money for sure but I think their long term value is essentially zero so you would have to time it just right.

The 12 words is your BIP32 seed and the most important part to protect and make sure it never sees the internet.  From that seed you can recover your wallet on any other BIP32 compatible service (which I think is pretty much all of them at this point).  Not too familiar with electrum, but as long as you have your seed protected (it is recommended to store 2 copies in different geographic locations in case of fire, etc.) you are good for wallet recovery.  You still need good opsec though to make sure your computer doesn't have malware like keyloggers, address substitution scripts, MITM attacks, etc. because your coins can still be stolen that way.  That's why it's generally recommended to get a hardware wallet which are more secure because the key signing happens on an airgapped device and eliminates nearly all attack vectors.  Check out trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com if interested.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:14:40
we are all still very early to the game, bitcoin has only been around for 7 years and isn't going anywhere.  This is still early 90's internet stage in terms of bitcoin development and growth potential.

I'd avoid blockchain.info.  
The simplistic setup imo is a coinbase app for your phone to buy and sell and a hardware wallet like trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com for longer term storage.  Buy with the app, send to the hardware wallet, HODL  ;)

Yes if bitcoin prices go up you have made "money" however bitcoin itself is money so in reality the purchasing power of your money has just increased (as opposed to losing value like the dollar due to inflation).  And yes, there is lots of money to be made (or lost) in trading bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:22:27
I mean you could sell it now and see a ROI but I think you'd be missing the forest for the trees.  
Most people conservatively advise you not to invest more than you are willing to potentially lose, bitcoin is still an ongoing experiment the likes of which the world has never seen. Personally I would not recommend investing in bitcoin with less than a 5-10 year time horizon and go into it on the understanding that it will either be worth a multiple of its current price or nothing at the end.

No one can predict future price but bitcoin price is governed by supply vs demand.  Supply is constrained more every 4 years and demand is spreading globally because bitcoin does several useful things that fiat money cant.  So take from that what you will.

Miners will get transaction fees once there are no more block rewards.  It would probably mean higher fees on the base layer but at that point (over 100 years from now) transactions would have shifted to layer 2 or layer 3 for cheap instant payments that leverage the security of the base bitcoin layer.

Very curious what part of public schooling in particular you think is the cause.  I don't recall being taught much in the way of economic theory until college and even then it was just touching on macro/micro principals.  Possibly touched on the function of the fed but it was probably only one page in a civics class.  
There is still something about public education that I don't really trust though but I can't put my finger on it. I guess its really more about what I wasn't taught, the principals of sound money and flaws in inflationary systems.  
That is also the age where you start earning and spending fiat.  As long as it works at the time nothing seems amiss.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:01:49

Basically Bitcoin is designed to gain value over time.  Money in your bank account is designed to lose value over time due to inflation.  So you just have to ask yourself, do I want to store my money in a deflationary asset (Bitcoin) or an inflationary asset (Dollars/fiat).
The 21 Million limit is a good thing, it is the reason why bitcoin is deflationary (fixed supply).  
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:41:08
It can function like a wallet but it is really acting like a bank.  Normally you would store your coins in a wallet that you control so you dont have to ask anyone (coinbase) for permission to access your funds.  
Price is just a function of supply vs demand.  Supply is slowly being constrained while bitcoin awareness and use cases are spreading globally.  
Try Gdax or Gemini for limit orders.  Your coins would be safe on an exchange while your hardware wallet ships to you.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:52:16
Exchanges charge a fee to make a profit.  There is then a transaction fee whenever you move bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:18:22
The password is just an extra security feature on login and probably decrypts your wallet.  Yes the 12 words will recreate the wallet.  Bitcoin are just ledger entries on the blockchain, that ledger is distributed worldwide on nodes.  Your private key (12 word seed) gives you permission move coins from one entry in the ledger to another.  I know it's confusing to start, but worth learning.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

Bitcoin could go to several million dollars per coin (or it could go to zero, bitcoin is an experiment in progress so do not risk more than you can afford to lose).  
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:45:00
Sure.  You will eventually want to move them off coinbase to a wallet you control to eliminate third party risk.  If you are securing more than $1000 worth I would recommend picking up a hardware wallet (try trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com)
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:17:45
without replay protection transactions are duplicated across both chains, so if you try to send your b2x to an exchange to sell you would also be sending your bitcoin (possibly to an incompatible address resulting in loss).  Splitting means separating the transaction history of the two chains such that when you make a transaction on one chain it is not duplicated on the other.  Because the s2x attack is refusing to implement basic replay protection the process of splitting is very difficult, I admit I do not even know the correct way to do it.  Tools are being developed to automate the process but they will expose you to third party risk so use with caution.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:19:30
gdax or gemini

No true, Bitcoin can vastly grow in purchasing power without affecting other commodities due to limited supply.

One thing I think is cool is that those with a comfortable financial system in place (like the US &amp; Europe) are much less incentivized to learn more about switching to a new financial system and those without working financial infrastructure are highly incentivized to adopt a system that can work no matter where they are.  For this reason I think the majority of the worlds poor will be the "early" adopters (we could all probably be classified as bleeding edge) which will give them a leg up vs the developed world and help to alleviate a lot of poverty.

After each fork you have equal amounts of coins on both chains.  They will not have the same value after the split so you're not exactly doubling your money but it is free money essentially if you're willing to go through the trouble of converting it to btc.  Some splits have replay protection built in and then selling the alt is relatively easy, the upcoming S2X attack however is refusing to implement basic replay protection so it is very difficult to split your coins.  Luckily [tools are being built for this purpose right now](  
In my personal opinion I think it's better to purchase now considering we're on a bull trend and you only get forked coins if you hold bitcoin at the time of the fork.  I think that's partly whats causing the rise is people holding altcoins are converting them to btc so they will get fork coins.  I expect this to continue until the S2X fork date and then a few days/weeks of confusion until it is clear that bitcoin has survived the attack.  
The argument to have a large amount now is duplicating that amount with fork coins, the argument against it is potential loss in value due to the bitcoin chain becoming slow due to miners refusing to mine the legacy chain and instead mining the S2X chain at a loss.  If this is your fist experience with bitcoin I would start with a small amount until you get comfortable with securing and sending your coins.  
Bitcoin will most likely face several challenges in its future and the possibility that some fatal flaw is discovered that crashes the price is non-zero, even though it seems to diminish every year that it has run reliably in a very hostile environment. That is why most people conservatively advise you not to invest more than you are willing to potentially lose, bitcoin is still an ongoing experiment the likes of which the world has never seen. Personally I would not recommend investing in bitcoin with less than a 5-10 year time horizon and go into it on the understanding that it will either be worth a multiple of its current price or nothing at the end.

That's a problem.  You should have recovery seeds for your 2FA I believe.  Otherwise you would need to convince the exchange that you are who you say you are by submitting a lot of identification documents, etc. so they can remove it.  Some exchanges like greenaddress use the 2FA to encrypt the wallet so you are just out of luck.  Lost 0.1 BTC that way  :(

@_date: 2017-11-01 23:28:19
You will have equal amounts of both bitcoin and s2x coins however the s2x attack has refused to implement basic replay protection so unless you have successfully split your coins (not for beginners) any time you try to send either bitcoin or s2x coins you will be duplicating the transaction on both chains and are in danger of sending your coins to an incompatible address resulting in loss of funds.

When there are no more coins issued miners will be rewarded with transaction fees for finding new blocks.  
Electricity cost definitely impact mining profitability and provide a floor for value but market price is not tied to energy prices.  Market price is solely determined by supply vs demand.  Supply is becoming more and more restricted while demand is continuously growing as word about bitcoin's useful properties is spreading globally and additional applications are built on top of it.  
Each having has been followed by surges in prices within a year of the halving event, this will most likely repeat with each subsequent halving to a lesser degree.

Depends on how many bitcoins you're holding.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:16:09
If transfer out of coinbase is sometimes delayed as they tend to put holds on transfers for some reason.  Once it is broadcast to the network though it should be available in Gemini within about 30 minutes, if you move it now it should arrive in time.  
It is always recommened to keep your coins in a wallet you control but Gemini is a trusted institution so they should be safe there for the time being.  You may not receive the fork coins though as you would if they were in the ledger.  This can be useful if you are later able to split them (tools are still being developed) and then sell them for more BTC.  
Yes Gemini is a professional exchange and can handle limit order without issue.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:21:28
Sounds like you're covered pretty well.  I personally don't store encrypted copies on the cloud (although some ppl do and they should be fine) and instead just have a couple physical copies of my seed words stored in different geographic locations (like fireproof safes).  
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:37:52
Sure if I understand what you are asking for nearly any wallet should allow you to import your BIP32 seed to recover all your addresses associated with that seed.  You can then generate public addresses for receiving funds.  Here are some good options.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:16:48
Not exactly clear from your wording.  Once you exchange dollars for bitcoin that amount of bitcoin is what you own.  The exchange rate for those coins may fluctuate over the course of a few days but you should still receive the same amount of coin (minus transaction fees).

That's right, every coin lost only puts more upward pressure on the price due to scarcity.  It would settle out once it reaches global saturation.  Even if millions of coins were lost it would still function fine as a global currency because each bitcoin is divisible into 100,000,000 units.  
This is a good video

I personally believe you should not invest in bitcoin with less than a 5-10 year time horizon and plan on your funds either be worth nothing or a multiple of your original investment.  
I recommended litcoin and monero as possible diversification however I dont own either because I still think bitcoin is the best long term bet and the true value of all altcoins is essentially zero.  Litecoin has just been really well run and is established, the silver to bitcoin's gold, etc.  Monero has good privacy features but that is coming to bitcoin as well so its value prop has a time decay.

Electrum is a very good wallet.  Trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com hardware wallets are more secure though.  
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:29:19
If creating paper wallets you would boot from liveUSB on a computer disconnected from the internet (make sure any wireless cards are off), then run the bitaddress.org HTML file (that was previously saved to USB) in a browser to generate the wallets and print them out.  
After that you can reboot to your normal environment and reconnect to the internet and your private keys will not have been exposed to the net.  There should be no saved file other than the bitaddress.org HTML file which can be deleted at that point.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:06:38

Thanks for the reply.  


Wouldn't the same game theory come into play that keeps mining pools from taking more than 51% of the hash rate?  i.e. if the miners try to "win the war" vs nodes they will end up crashing the system that they rely on for income in the first place thus they are incentivized to cooperate rather than cheat?

@_date: 2017-11-25 23:28:02
1) yes it's fine but it's generally recommended to move it to a wallet you control, coins on coinbase are just an IOU, you need to ask permission from coinbase in order to move them.  Coins in a wallet where you control the private keys are yours alone.  
2) Bitcoin only in my opinion, all useful properties of altcoins will eventually be integrated into Bitcoin so I see the long term value of all alts at zero.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:35:03
1) yes there are tools currently being developed for this
2) That is one option but you will have to wait until coinbase is ready to let you access your split coins.  It is also not a good idea in general to keep your coins on an exchange due to third party risk.  Plus they have been a supporter of the S2X attack so it's unclear if they will be attempting to pass off the S2X fork as actual bitcoin (it's not).

Segwit is a recent upgrade to the bitcoin network that makes transactions cheaper and faster.  It is recommended that everyone move their coins to segwit addresses.

You dont "need" segwit, it is just recommended, legacy addresses will continue to work fine.

People spend it once they desire the good/service more than they value the potential future appreciation of the coins.

With your recovery seed phrase your wallet can be restored on a new device even if the original wallet is stolen, lost, broken, thrown in a river, etc...
Coinbase on the other hand poses a third party risk, however that is an acceptable trade off for some for convenience.

By Bitcoin accounts they probably mean an account on an exchange where you can convert between Bitcoin and your local currency.  For example if I was sending money between US and China I would probably make an account on Coinbase and have the recipient make and account on Huobi.   Then I would buy BTC with dollars in the US on Coinbase, send the Bitcoins to the recipient account on Huobi where they could then sell for CNY.  I would recommend a minimum of 2FA on all accounts as a security best practice.

Segwit already prevents ASICBOOST hence the reason it has been blocked to this point.

Coinbase and circle are just like a bitcoin bank, your bank would also require ID when opening an account.  
Localbitcoins is more like Craigslist, meeting someone in person to exchange for cash (no ID required).  You can also buy electronically through local bitcoins so you don't have to meet face to face but I haven't done it myself.

Yes you would send your coins to the public address for your Electrum wallet (make sure you have written down your seed phrase and stored it securely).  The coins would then be in your electrum wallet and not on coinbase however your bitcoins are technically not on your computer at all but instead stored as entries in the distributed ledger.
Think of it as an excel file that is copied across all nodes on the planet who are constantly checking it for accuracy.  This excel file has two columns;  Column A (wallet public address) and Column B (wallet balance).  Each row in the file is a different wallet.  Your private key gives you the authority to move the coins associated with that address to a different address.  So in a sense your coins are everywhere at once and not really contained in your wallet.  Your wallet is just a way to manage the private key for that address and a GUI for making transactions.

I think this is incorrect.  He cashed out a 401k (pre-tax money) to purchase coins.  If he had converted it to a traditional IRA for example and bought GBTC he would owe tax on any gains when he withdrew his money, say in 10 years.  The way he is doing it his money will now be post tax and he shouldn't own any taxes on his gains except for long term capital gains, no?

The [Lightning network]( and [Sidechains]( are currently being developed / implemented and should address many of these concerns.  I am not the most technically versed on these but I can give you my understanding of their use.
**Lightning**:  Will use secure payment channels to will allow thousands of transactions to occur while only having to write to the blockchain one time to record all of them.  This will increase the speed of transactions to something more comparable to writing to a SQL database and decrease the transaction fee by orders of magnitude.    
**Sidechains**: Allows for creating sidechains that can play with variables in the blockchain (for example having a 10 second block time for fast confirmations) while still being pegged to a BTC value and secured by the hashing power of the main blockchain.

This is what I do, it just makes sense when you have the option to save in a deflationary asset and spend an inflationary one.  The goods and services still get purchased I just get to pocket the difference between the rate of return of my btc stash vs the financing cost of my debt.  BTC returns have utterly destroyed debt interest in this capacity for the past several years.  
In fact I went even further and sold all my hard assets (properties, etc.) and now rent everything I can and for the rest I purchase it with low interest no down payment financing.  Feels like I'm printing money honestly.

You purchase bitcoins by either providing a credit card or bank account information.  Once purchased the coins are in your Circle "wallet" and you can then transfer them to a personal wallet (for example Mycelium on android or Breadwallet on iOs) where you control the private keys.

You can see all the transactional history but because bitcoin is pseudonymous you cannot necessarily know which address is tied to which identity unless you can link them somehow.

Sites built on top of the bitcoin protocol are susceptible to hacking in direct relation to how well their security best practices are implemented.  The bitcoin protocol based on distributed proof of work or "blockchain"  however has proven invulnerable to hacks up to this point (with one exception I believe back in 2010 or so which was rolled back once the vulnerability was realized).  As the protocol is constantly being improved and hashing power continues to increase it is only getting stronger over time.  Hopefully that answers your question, I am not the most knowledgeable in the intricacies of the protocol so someone may chime in and correct a few of my points but the main point I am trying to convey is that the protocol itself is very secure, however companies built on top of it will always contain third party risks.

I sold them to get out the equity.  I was earning maybe 2-3% per year from property appreciation, some tax advantages, and slowly paying down the mortgages however I was still paying interest on the mortgages and upkeep on the properties.  
Knowing the deflationary properties of Bitcoin it just made sense to allocate my capital where it could work most effectively.   
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:09:24
Even if you have multiple revenue streams they still need to exceed BTC returns in order to make financial sense to keep them and not sell for more btc.  I haven't seen any asset or company on the planet over the last decade that compares.  
Granted most ppl are not comfortable going "all in" like that and that's fine, if they have revenue generating investments that exceed their expenditures they can live that way in perpetuity.  
If they do not they will eventually run out of fiat if they make the logical choice to spend it instead of BTC, at which point they will be forced to spend their BTC to make up the difference between their income and expenses.  
@_date: 2016-09-16 18:15:57
When you are first starting out I would recommend just purchasing a small amount to play with (like $20 worth or something) from an exchange (circle.com for example).  Send it to a mobile wallet (mycelium for andriod or breadwallet for iOs) after securing your backup codes.  Then try sending it between wallets and making purchases online.  
Once you feel comfortable using it you can look into purchasing larger amounts if you want to invest longer term and place them into cold storage or a hardware wallet to keep them safe (look in the securing your bitcoins section for guides).

No asset can instantaneously go from zero to true valuation without volatility, Bitcoin is still in it's infancy and the price discovery phase is still far from over.  If it is useful as a currency and store of value it will be adopted and continue increasing in a volatile fashion which may take decades before it stabilizes at a true valuation.  If it's not it will die off and classical keynesian economists can all laugh and claim that they were right all along.  
Personally I see the value in a decentralized, deflationary, programmable bearer instrument and put my money where my mouth is years ago.  I have no problem whatsoever with this volatility, in fact it is entirely expected and normal during price discovery and adoption.  Those of us who understand the fundamentals of what makes Bitcoin valuable and have the patience to see it through price discovery are the ones who will be rewarded in the end if our hypothesis is correct.  
Or Krugman et all will get to laugh at our naivety, time will tell who was on the right side of history but I can tell you nothing you can say will sway my resolve to see this project through to it's end, one way or another.

First, it doesn't need anywhere near that rate of return to beat fiat and debt interest.  15-20% per annum would do just fine and I think BTC can keep that up for many decades.  As you acknowledged yourself fiat loses purchasing power every year so even a 0% rate of return asset beats it as a savings medium.  
Second it would need to become the universal currency and commodity, essentially absorbing all of M1, M2, etc. money supply before it stabilized.  At that point fiat would no longer exist so at that point saying ppl will hoard it doesn't make sense because it's rate of return will only change with global GDP and fiat will no longer exist.  Bitcoin will then *be* money and the global unit of account.  Anytime anyone purchased anything they would be spending BTC and distributing it to another.

Yes, as all fiat approaches zero in value BTC priced in that fiat approaches infinity until the fiat totally collapses at which point 1BTC is just equal 1BTC.

One great thing is using credit as a tool.  If you have enough btc that you could buy a Lambo outright you can instead finance a Lambo with $0 down and say $3k/month payment over 7 years (estimate, haven't calculated it).  That way you can get your Lambo today and only convert enough to cover the payment each month.  
The bet you are making is that over the 7 year life of the loan btc will appreciate so you get your immediate gratification of the use of the vehicle while at the same time allowing your savings to continue growing.  If BTC ever fell to zero you can always sell the Lambo and get out of the payment.  
@_date: 2016-09-23 18:49:12
You should always be able to get your transaction through with the [appropriate fee]( so I dont see this becoming an issue.  Scaling solutions are in the works regardless and I highly doubt transaction volume will rise to the level where fees are exorbitant before they are implemented.  
IMO portability and divisibility are already off the charts compared to other forms of money.  
**Portability**: since bitcoin is a distributed ledger bitcoins are simultaneously everywhere on the planet already, you dont technically "move" bitcoins, you just update the ledger with new balances on different addresses.
**Divisibility**: No other money comes close to being as divisible as bitcoin which can be divided down to 1/100,000,000th of the base unit (BTC), and which could be divided further if necessary with a protocol update.

A lot of people agree bitcoin is a groundbreaking technology, if they are right it should have more and more usage in the future.  As usage increases price increases due to supply and demand because bitcoin supply is limited.  Because of that I think bitcoin has plenty of upside potential for years to come but that is just my personal opinion.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:41:22
GBTC is only loosely correlated to BTC, it trades at a premium to BTC because it is easier for main Street investors to get exposure to GBTC than learn how to actually buy BTC.  But that premium could go to zero or negative very quickly if it looks like a Bitcoin ETF is going to be approved, evaporating a lot of value.  It's a riskier bet I'm which is why I bought BTC directly with my 401k and traditional IRA instead of GBTC.

It will always be safe to purchase coins (assuming you are using a reputable exchange).  Post split you will have 2 coins (1 bitcoin and 1 segwit2x coin) for every 1 bitcoin you control at the time of the split.  If you send either coin after the split you will duplicate the transaction on the other chain.  If you dont care about segwit2x coins you can transact as normal with bitcoin.  If however you attempt to send your segwit2x coins to an exchange to sell you would need to make sure you have split them correctly first (not intuitive because there is currently no replay protection for this hostile fork) otherwise you would risk sending your actual bitcoin instead and could potentially lose coins.  
1) before the split you can buy coins as normal but make sure to transfer them to an address you control (not an exchange).
2) after the split if you dont care about segwit2x coins you can continue using bitcoin as normal.
3) if you want to attempt to sell your segwit2x coins for more bitcoin you need to make sure you have split them correctly otherwise you would risk sending your actual bitcoin.

You want to park your savings in a place where it can get the best return, i.e. let your money work for you instead of the other way around.  Bitcoin is designed to grow in value over time, money in a bank saving account just loses value over time due to inflation and fees.  So while there are many options for "cashing out" (try  the smart move is to keep your discretionary savings in Bitcoin long term.

When they are on bittrex you are letting them decide if/when/how they split your coins.  If they are in a wallet you control then you decide if/when/how to split.  
It is genrrally advised not to keep coins on an exchange but instead in a wallet you control.

Thanks, I enjoy helping newcomers, it's my own little contribution since I'm not a developer :)
I wouldn't use a desktop wallet unless the computer has never touched the internet and you are just using it for offline transaction signing.  My recommendation would be a mobile wallet for up to a few hundred dollars (mycelium is good for android but I will probably switch to samourai when it is ready), then a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger for anything more.  I don't use desktop at all to store coins.  
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:08:32
Yes, perfectly legal, you would be required to pay capital gains tax on the profit though.

I'm sure your money is fine but coinbase is very slow sometimes, especially with all the recent price attention they are swamped I think.  I have been happy with Gemini, I think it was a good choice.

Glad you found it useful :) They're more secure because they're airgapped hardware, but about the same difficulty to use.  
I keep a few hundred dollars on my mobile for on the go spending but the majority of my coins are on hardware wallets for longer term storage.

@_date: 2017-09-28 11:11:44
Good question.  Paper wallets need to be swept to a new address because in order to move the coins the private keys needs to be broadcast on the internet, once that happens it is not safe to keep the coins in that wallet because if anyone was to see that key they could take the coins.  
A hardware wallet on the other hand never exposes private keys to the internet, it does all of its key signing on airgapped hardware with no internet communication so coins can be sent to and from the device safely.  In general newcomers are advised toward hardware wallets unless they have a strong understanding of computer security best practices.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:43:51
The learning curve is definitely steep, but worth it.  Sounds like you're doing good.  Mobile OS are more secure than desktop generally.  I would use a software wallet until you get more than $500 or so then get a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger.  In gemini you would go to withdraw and then send them to the public address of your mobile wallet.  Make sure you have backed up the seed phrase for your wallet, there are some recommended ones in the "securing your bitcoins" section above.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:03:22


Is MC your abbreviation for Mycelium?  Before the fork you should each move your coins to an address you control (ideally a BIP32 compatible wallet like a hardware wallet but a paper wallet will work too) and you will be credited with an equal amount of B2X (hostile fork coins) however splitting it is not straight forward because they are refusing to implement basic replay protection so if you try to move your B2X coins to an exchange to sell you would also be moving your BTC which could cause you to lose your BTC unless you have split them beforehand.  
All major wallets should be staying on the BTC chain, it is only those companies and exchanges supporting the NYA that may possibly try to call the B2X coins the real BTC but doing so would be legal suicide for them so I think they're bluffing.  
And yes, you can use your seed to recover your coins on any BIP32 compatible wallet.

Yes that is a solid plan provided the addresses have been generated securely (clean Linux OS,  no internet connection).  Note however that paper wallets should only be used once for the full amount which is why it is recommend to make multiple wallets of varying amounts.  
The blockchain.info recommendation is outdated, don't use them.  This is a better site for newcomers and should explain everything, let me know if you have additional questions.  
Really though I can't recommend hardware wallets enough, it's worth the $100 or so for the ease of use, peace of mind, extra features/services and BIP32 compatibility.

I haven't used Jaxx but haven't heard anything bad about them and they have been around awhile.  As long as your coins are in an address you control you will get coins on both chains, splitting them on the other hand may prove difficult so dont attempt to move coins on either chain post fork until you can confirm they have split otherwise you would be moving both coins whenever you transact and that could result in loses.  
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:47:13
PCs are generally more prone to viruses than mobile.  Hardware wallets are the safest because the transaction signing is done on airgapped hardware so they private keys are never exposed to the internet.  
What is important is that you use a BIP32 compatible wallet which means when you create the wallet you should be prompted to write down a string of seed words which can be used to recover your wallet in case your PC dies or your house burns down, etc. 
If you have your coins in a wallet you control you will have both coins but splitting them will be difficult unless they add replay protection to s2x.    You would still be able to use bitcoin as normal but my understanding is that if you spend them you might be spending the equivalent b2x coins in the process unless you were able to split them.  I'm sure someone will be publishing a splitting guide as the fork approaches.  
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:23:09
Not entirely clear, but any wallet you created with a BIP32 seed can be imported into any other BIP32 compatible wallet.

You could probably just about as an independent consultant and charge a small hourly fee but I don't really know how the SEC views that type of thing.  I would send them to Gemini or Gdax if they are looking to purchase larger amounts.  You can try OTC markets but that is even less regulated and higher scam potential.  The fee is really miniscule in the big picture when compared to BTC annual gains.

@_date: 2017-10-22 13:21:45
You would need to split your coins using a splitting tool (currently being developed) since replay protection is not being included in this segwit2x fork.  If you sent your Bitcoin to bitstamp after the fork you would be sending your segwit2x coins as well and could lose those if bitstamp isn't prepared to accept them.

You should do more research then before making knee-jerk statements like that because you are uninformed and make yourself look foolish.  
They have had a [scaling roadmap]( for a long time now that included a well tested upgrade called Segwit which was a large capacity increase and enabled layer 2 scaling that could increase transaction throughput 1000x with essentially free transactions.  It was the monopolist miners who refused for over a year to enable the upgrade until recently when users forced their hand.  
Those pointing the finger at core for not bowing to political pressure to do an unneeded and unsafe fork to bitcoin are actually the ones blocking scaling progres.  Thankfully their influence is now greatly diminished and after the segwit2x attack fails they will be mostly relegated to the dustbin of history.

1) Sure there's a chance, no one can say for certain however a lot of the evaluations of Bitcoin fundamentals say it should eventually reach $100,000+ with continued adoption and use cases built on top of it.  We may just be correcting closer to it's true value as it becomes more widely understood.  
2) it will definitely continue to be highly volatile until the market cap is much higher and there are more onramp/offramps built and more exchange listings, etc.  In general it has been volatile in the upward direction however so if you have a long enough timeline and the stomach to ride the waves Bitcoin can offer very attractive returns on capital.

@_date: 2017-09-15 02:41:22
GBTC is only loosely correlated to BTC, it trades at a premium to BTC because it is easier for main Street investors to get exposure to GBTC than learn how to actually buy BTC.  But that premium could go to zero or negative very quickly if it looks like a Bitcoin ETF is going to be approved, evaporating a lot of value.  It's a riskier bet I'm which is why I bought BTC directly with my 401k and traditional IRA instead of GBTC.

You have to have extremely efficient hardware that usually goes obsolete in just a few months, nearly free electricity, etc. in order to be profitable.

It might be secure (or might not), the main criticism would probably be that the coins are not under your control unless they are in your personal wallet where you alone have the seed.  Otherwise you have an IOU from coinbase for your coins.     
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:24:25


No, you hold your appreciating asset (BTC) until all your depreciating assets (fiat) are depleted.  At that point you are forced to spend your coin in exchange for goods and services while allowing your remaining wealth to continue to grow.  
In addition, once you feel affluent enough from your holdings to the point you don't ever think they could reasonably be depleted you will naturally begin to spend more of it on luxury items, business ventures, income generating assets like real estate, gift it to friends and family, etc.  (I speak from personal experience in addition to logic).  
BTC will eventually be much more distributed than it is currently you just have to think on a long enough timescale.  
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:23:51
Some estimates put it at over $1MM per coin if it gets global traction.  I personally store my discretionary savings in btc because savings stored in fiat lose value over time due to inflation while Bitcoin is designed to gain in value over the long term due to its limited supply.

Difficult but not impossible without replay protection, I am not entirely clear on how to do so myself yet (but I would be splitting to sell B2X and hold onto my BTC personally).  
Without replay you could sell post fork but you may lose your b2x in the process.  You could also sell it pre fork and buy it back later but if you're not holding coin at the time of the fork you wont get the equivalent b2x.  up to you on what's important.

Impossible to predict where the market will go (although my personal gut feeling is it is going to continue climbing for awhile) so it may be best to dollar cost average into the market.  If you have coins now you would get an equal number of B2X coins at the split but it will be difficult to seperate them to sell the B2X coins since they are refusing to add replay protection.  
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:11:38

As you print more and more money it becomes worth less and less, all fiat currencies eventually hyperinflate to the point they are worthless and you're buying a loaf of bread with a wheelbarrow of cash.  


The opposite actually, Bitcoin as valued in USD should continue to rise as more and more dollars are printed and all those dollars chase a finite amount of bitcoin.  
Just because Bitcoin is finite doesn't mean it's not incredibly divisible though, you can currently divide each Bitcoin into 100,000,000 pieces called satoshis, each of which are individually programmable.  
The only ceiling for the price of Bitcoin would be the percentage increase in global GDP growth once it has become the global currency.

It would be reflected in your coinbase balance, however it is generally advised to move your coins off exchange to a wallet you control after purchase otherwise your coins are just an IOU from Coinbase.  Coinbase is a third party risk and there is the possiblity they could be hacked, exit scam, govt intervention, etc. preventing you from accessing your coins.  When they are in a wallet you control only you decide when and where they move.

Software wallets are free.  If you only have a little you could use a mobile wallet like Mycelium for android or Breadwallet for iOs.  If you purchase more then secure hardware wallet storage like a trezor or ledger would be advised however they cost about $100 or so.  If you want to use a paper wallet then  is a good site but new users are generally advised to go with hardware wallets due to simplicity and security.  


When you generate a paper wallet it will print out a public and private key (also known as public/private addresses).  The public key is the address you will send your coins to from Coinbase.  The private key is the one you use to move your coins however with paper wallets you can only use it once because in order to use it you are exposing it to the internet so you should always sweep the entirety of the funds to a new wallet when moving from a paper wallet.  For this reason it is generally suggested that you create multiple paper wallets of increasing value so you can only move as much as is needed.  Say you had 20 BTC to secure, you would create 10 with 0.1 BTC, 9 with 1 BTC and 2 with 5 BTC, as an example.  
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:54:46
The smaller the purchase the greater the percentage is taken from fees.  I was concerned about fees as well when first purchasing but in hindsight it was much more important to just make the purchase because those fees are now minuscule.  There is no guarantee that bitcoin will increase in value but it was designed to be deflationary so it makes sense.  My advice is to purchase bitcoin with a 5-10 year time horizon and only invest what you would potentially be comfortable losing, then evaluate what you want to do with it at that point as it should be either worth a lot or nothing.

Bitcoin has been very volatile but it has generally been in the upward direction.  I think dollar cost averaging like you are doing is a great strategy if you don't want to go "all-in" up front and instead ease into the market.  That's not to say that if you see a good dip in the price it wouldn't be a good opportunity to add a little more to it, up to you in the end and what you're comfortable with.  Buying bitcoin for me feels a bit crazy now, like a drop in the bucket compared to my current holdings, but I still keep doing it because I believe it is where I will have the best returns on my savings, nothing else comes close imo.

Mining is in a constant state of equilibrium, if mining becomes unprofitable for some they will drop out and the more efficient miners will make additional income due to the lack of competition.  That in turn decreases the difficulty and then new miners enter the market because they see a profit opportunity.

You could be ok with electrum but be careful storing coins on a desktop.
I would recommend you move them to a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger instead.  I know Trezor made it easy to split the bcash coins, hopefully they will have a solution to split the B2X coins as well but it's not as easy this time since there is no replay protection.  I'm sure there will be more guides on how to split as the fork approaches.

No one can predict future price.  Bitcoin is designed to grow in value over time though, albeit with high volatility.  If you are concerned about buying at a local top though you can always dollar cost average your purchases by setting up smaller automated buys each week.   
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:03:59
Are you trying to sell them?  Otherwise they're fine sitting in the paper wallet.  If you are just trying to move them to a new wallet you would import the private key into that wallet.  Make sure you have safely stored your seed words first though.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:12:05
You will be fine leaving it there for now but it is generally advised to keep your coin in an address that you control.  When you keep your coins on coinbase you are trusting them to let you access them which could go wrong in a number of ways (hacks, exit scam, govt intervention, etc.).  
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:06:09

B2X is not intending to use replay protection so you would have to be very careful splitting your coins (not a beginner technique) so you don't accidentally spend your BTC when you think you are spending your B2X.

Well your mobile wallet should prompt you to write down your seed phrase which will generate your private keys.  You will then unlock your wallet and send funds with pin/password/2FA.  So you would have private keys for both mobile and hardware wallets.

Electrum is secure, no real downside, some people like to run their own full node so they don't have to trust other nodes to verify their transactions.  
You would get the public address of your electrum wallet (make sure you have your seed written down) and send the coins there.

Start with coinbase or Gemini if you're in the US.  Don't invest more than you're willing to potentially lose, Bitcoin is still an experiment in progress and being attacked constantly.  When I invested I asked myself I I though bitcoin would outperform the market and my 401k by the time I reached 59.5 and my answer was a resounding yes.  For that reason I have a 20+ year time horizon for my investment and any ups and downs in the meantime is just volatility.  There are several times where I made purchases only to have the exchange rate drop immediately but I always held strong and am now way ahead as a result.  What I'm essentially saying is view it as long term wealth storage and don't worry about intraday volatility.

You could use this if you purchase a trezor.

In that case there are several mobile wallets that may be a good option but I would suggest moving to a hardware wallet once you have more than $1000 or so.  
Several risks with coinbase (or any other third party service), they could get hacked, exit scam (unlikely imo but possible), govt seizure, etc.  Coins on an exchange are just an IOU for your coins.  Unless you have them in a wallet where you alone hold the private keys they are not truly your coins.   
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:20:07
You should move your coins to an address you control otherwise you are exposed to third party risk.  For newbies the easiest and more secure is a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:22:10
Hardware wallet would be most secure.  For mobile wallets anything on bitcoin.org should be fine.  
Electrum, mycelium, Airbitz are all good.  
The biggest thing is to have all your coins in an address you control before the split.  After the split don't attempt to move any segwit2x coins to an exchange to sell until after adequate splitting tools are available otherwise you may be moving your actual BTC without realizing it.   
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:58:34
Give him (or anyone else who wants to make payment) the public key (public address) of your wallet.  Do not give anyone your private keys or they could take your coins.  Once he sends the payment you should see it in your wallet after a few seconds, if you want to wait for one confirmation it would be about 10 minutes.

This was your original point, which I destroyed by showing you millions of items you can buy with bitcoin right now.  


Gyft actually gave a 10% discount for purchases with bitcoin.


You're right, I don't spend my bitcoin unless I absolutely have to and doing so has made me quite wealthy.  I do spend it on occasion though when worth it, for example I just used it for the down payment on a Tesla.  If you don't get why bitcoin is so valuable (newsflash: growth from $100 to $4000 in 4 years was not a fluke) you could either close your mouth and educate yourself or ask intelligent questions in an attempt to understand but you are obviously just a troll and don't have any interest in either.

You will always pay either an exchange fee (at an ATM for example) or spread on exchanges.  This can be less than bank transfer fees but you need to research.

There are always fees, some sites have less than others.  You should move them off any exchange as a general practice.  Coins on coinbase or nitrogen are just IOUs for your coins, they are not really yours unless you hold the private keys.  What makes it worse is that coinbase might try to call the B2X fork BTC and would credit you B2X for your actual BTC, ugh.  You can store any amount on a paper wallet as long as it was generated on a clean OS like a Linux live USB and booted on an airgapped (not internet connected) computer.  Your best bet for storage is a hardware wallet but may not be worth it for a few hundred dollars, paper wallets are a good economical option.

@_date: 2017-10-12 19:20:12
Replay protection is a simple and basic security feature that any potential fork should implement (they are choosing not to because this is an attack, not a legitimate fork).  Basically it means you can split the coins so you can sell your B2X coins without also accidentally selling your BTC.   Their refusal to implement is gross negligence and will cause people to lose their BTC not understanding that moving B2X also means moving BTC (you should be able to move them independent of each other if replay is implemented).

Investing in bitcoin with a 1 or 2 month time horizon is just gambling imo.  Bitcoin is a groundbreaking technology on par with the internet itself.  It is either going to fail spectacularly or be worth an amazing amount of money in 10+ years.  I think that is the proper approach to take when investing, only put in what you would be comfortable potentially losing and be willing to let it sit for a decade or so to be either worth nothing or a small fortune.  
My personal opinion is the bubble is just starting and we will see 30k+ within the next 1-2 years*.

When you first set up your hardware wallet you will be prompted to write down a string of BIP32 seed words for wallet recovery, so if your hardware fails, house burns down, eaten by your dog, etc. You can just recover your coins by entering the seed phrase on any BIP32 compatible wallet.  
If the coins remain in the wallet unmoved post fork there is no risk to losing them.  You need to be careful post fork however if you ever decided to move your 2x coins that you are not moving your actual Bitcoin instead.  That is the risk users are facing due to 2x's refusal to add replay protection to their fork.  
Yes post split you will have main branch BTC Bitcoin and the fork branch B2X Bitcoin2x.  You can tell which is the real BTC because it will be the one supported by the dozens of talented core developers.
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:30:09
What matters is that the BIP32 seed was generated securely and that you protect that (i.e. keep 2+ copies in different geograpic locations in case of flood, fire, etc.).  That way if your device is ever lost or destroyed you can just purchase a new one and fully recover your funds on your new device using your seed.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:46:19
Bitcoin core is the group of hundreds of extremely talented core developers who upgrade the bitcoin protocol through FOSS best practices of open discussion, peer review, stress testing, screening improvements based on merit, etc.
Bitcoin cash and Segwit2X are forks of the Bitcoin project that at best should be classified as rushed and poorly implemented altcoins with no developer support and at worst outright attacks on Bitcoin who's only purpose is to try to wrest control over the codebase from Core and put it in the hands of corporate monopolists and governments who would either attempt to take it over or destroy it.  
At best it will be a minor disruption but at worst (since Segwit2X seems to intentionally refuse to implement replay protection) we could see massive confusion and potential loss of funds in the community by those who try to spend on one chain without realizing they are spending on the other as well. 
The simple answer is that whatever core is working on is Bitcoin the rest are just altcoins.

There will always be a transfer fee moving between wallets.  You can move it less frequently for larger amounts to avoid fees.

You should take your coins off exchanges to a wallet where you control the private keys.  You would have equal amounts of both but without adquate replay protection you would be in danger of selling your actual Bitcoin if you were to move your b2x to an exchange to sell.   Splitting them is not an easy task at this point.

You would have to ensure that you had a transaction that was not duplicated on both chains.  This is difficult to do due to replay protection, I am not even sure how to do it myself, people are building tools to assist but you need to be careful about using someone else's splitting tool.

They parties pushing the NYA and 2x attack obviously don't care about logic and reason and listening to the experts developing bitcoin, so the only explanation I can come to for the behavior of any of them is either wanting a power grab over development, being bought by one of the parties attempting the power grab, facing government/bank coercion, or trying to generate as much disruption as possible to suppress price while they acquire, however it's not clear where individual parties fall.

I was saying they would give you spot price so you could avoid the atm 5% fee. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:22:11
Coins for sale on localbitcoins are generally selling above spot price, I would be very wary of anyone selling at a discount.  Coinbase is fine for a new user, but only because a better option doesn't really exist at the moment.  When you set up your hardware wallet they will provide you a public key (aka public address) that you would send your coins to, after which they would be secured by the hardware wallet and you would have to approve the transaction using the hardware wallet to move them.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:37:24
Yes it's uncertain whether the miners will follow through with their fork.  Price could go up or down, often markets like the removal of uncertainty either way.  If you hold coins in an address you control you would have an equal amount of segwit2x coins but splitting them is not a simple matter due to the fact that they have refused to implement basic replay protection.

Well if you can generate the multisig keys offline and then seperate them physically any potential thief would have to get a hold of M-of-N keys (usually 2 of 3) in order to access the coins, much more secure than just having them on a single computer however the tradeoff is convenience, it's a good solution for long term storage while keeping a smaller amount for spending on electrum.

From a previous comment:
Yes you can use paper wallets if you feel comfortable creating them on an airgapped machine with a clean OS.  
Yes if they got your seed they could steal your BTC, unless you password protected your hardware wallet as well.  The wallet does offline transaction signing so the private keys are never exposed to the internet.
You can make a backup laptop or raspberry pi your airgapped hardware wallet.  I know armory has that capability, probably electrum too.   
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:57:48
I guess I'm mainly wondering if they're currently holding BTC or fiat to know whether there will be buying or selling pressure.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:51:51
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:14:56
You will.  In fact the only way you can access both coins immediately is if your coins are in a wallet you control at the time of the fork.  Otherwise you are waiting on your exchange to implement split protection (if they ever even do).  
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:56:38
they are a decent option.  There is also bitstamp and kraken for exchanges.  Some more at buybitcoinworldwide.com as well.  
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:31:26
Definitely don't keep your coins on exchange unless you are actively trading.  If you don't control your coins they are just IOUs.  There have been several exchanges that have been hacked, exit scam, etc. and ppl never saw their coins again.  
A workaround is to keep your Trezor in your car or something so you always have it.  I would pin protect it though.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:50:55
I think Bitcoin may change that.  We may all retire much sooner as a global populace than we previously thought possible.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:37:49
It's an attack on Bitcoin by corporate and/or government actors.  After the split you will have equal amounts of BTC (actual Bitcoin) and B2X (hostile fork coins) however the B2X coins will likely be valued significantly below actual BTC and splitting them is difficult because the hostile fork is refusing to implement replay protection which would make splitting (and then selling the B2X coins) easy and safe.  The way it is currently if you tried to send your B2X to an exchange to sell you would be sending your BTC as well which could cause you to lose your BTC.  The best thing to do is hold your coins in an address you control before the split and then after the split just forget about the B2X and transact only with BTC or wait until reliable splitting tools are available for you to claim the B2X and sell them without risking your BTC.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:24:07

My pleasure, let me know if you have any other questions.   
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:25:41
I agree price movement would be required for value transfer in excess of market cap.  Slippage will certainly be there but it could end up working out in your favor (maybe not though).  My point is though that the network can still transfer that amount of value even if the price is at $10, it just wouldn't stay at that price.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:46:42
Yes that is correct, you will get equal coins on both forks, but there are risks if you try to move your fork coins if the fork didn't include replay protection (which this upcoming segwit2x fork is maliciously refusing to implement as they are trying to pass themselves off as bitcoin and fool newcomers).  
The risk is you could be sending your actual btc when you think you are sending your fork coins which could result in lost btc.  If you do not care about your fork coins you are fine just using btc as usual.  Eventually there will be splitting tools built that will allow you to move your fork coins to an exchange to sell without risking your btc in the process. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:16:12


They won't be equal value, you will just have the same number of each.  


Obv do your research but I have seen no indication they will be following the B2X fork and will be sticking with the chain that doesn't break consensus rules.  Even if they didn't you should still be able to import your coins to any BIP32 compatible wallet with your seed phrase and still have both coins.  


Yea when a standard transaction fee is worth half your coins it doesn't really make sense to move or split them.  Just not worth the trouble.  


I believe this is possible when you are just recovering​ your wallet with your seed phrase in a new wallet and not sending them from one wallet to another.  


Yes that is the magic of BIP32 :)

In general after you purchase you should transfer to a wallet you control.  I would recommend a mobile wallet for now, if you get $1000 or so it might make sense to get a trezor or ledger hardware wallet as they run about $100.  
I would also practice purchasing something small from overstock or other btc merchant to get the feel for using it.

Their fork can survive without consequence however if they were able to wrest control of development then Bitcoin would be dead for all intents and purposes.  It's not going to happen though as much as they may want to stay in power Bitcoin was invented to free humanity and they cannot force users to change the software they run of their own free will.

If you want security with low cost I would create paper wallets from a Linux boot from usb on a pc not connected to the internet.

Trezor.io and Ledgerwallet.com are the leading hardware wallets at the moment.  Paper wallets are more difficult to set up securely and dont have as many features.  
Not familiar with BitConnects but I would be cautious with bitcoin lending, seems fishy.  The best way to invest bitcoin is not to lose it  ;)
But seriously, there are things like margin lending on platforms like bitfinex, but again you're trusting a third party with your coins, so yea...

If you are referring to GBTC then no, not yet.  I was referring to moving your 401k to a self managed trust account which can be done without too much difficulty.  Its essentially a rollover into your management which can then be invested in almost anything (land, real estate, gold, bitcoin, commodities, etc.) with a few exceptions (you cant invest in your own business for example).  There are still penalties if you were to do an early withdrawl but you can choose which asset classes you are exposed to, in the case of bitcoin you can actually hold the private keys.    
Edit:  Also, in the case of GBTC (or the ETF) it can still be confiscated because you wouldn't hold the private keys.

Mobile wallet is just a wallet on your mobile phone.  Desktop wallet is one installed on your PC.  There are also browser (assuming this is what you meant by internet based) wallets that are essentially just webpages.  Hardware wallets are physical devices that do key storage and transaction signing away from the internet so hackers can not get access.    
When setting up your hardware wallet (check out trezor.io or ledgerwallet.com) you will be prompted to write down a seed phrase that can be used to recover your wallet.  If the physical device is ever lost, stolen or damaged you can get a new one and recover the funds using the seed phrase.

AML and KYC (know your customer) are reporting requirements placed on exchanges to prevent money laundering, tax evasion, etc.  Most major exchanges have to comply.  It basically means you have to give up your identity in order to purchase with them.  Benefits would be the ability to make larger purchases quickly with less fees. If protecting your identity is important I would suggest using one of the cash purchase options listed in the "buying bitcoins" section.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:13:35
You can earn bitcoins by trading goods or services for it.  You could also try swing trading but just know that most people lose money. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:03:19
You could still move that amount.  As you purchased the bitcoins with fiat the price would just rise from $10 to the level it needed to be to accommodate storing that amount of value, then move it as usual.  There would cartainly be large moves on both sides of the buy and sell though, could end up making a lot on the transfer (if you started a new bubble with the buy) or losing a lot (if you floored the price with the sell) but the network would certainly absorb and move that amount of value.

Those are both great options.  






Personal preference I would say, they are both used widely.  


No one knows when the right time to buy is.  Trying to time the market is trading and most people lose doing that.  Dollar cost averaging is a pretty good way to enter the market, basically buying a set amount on a recurring basis over time.  Otherwise if you are looking to enter all at once I would have a long enough time horizon in mind so you aren't concerned about day/week/month fluctuations.  


There may be a way, although I am not an expert on drive recovery.  You should check with forensic drive imaging services.

The QR code is probably either the public key or the private key.  If it's the public key scanning it should show the wallet's balance and address but you would be unable to use it to claim the funds.  If it's the private key any wallet should allow you to import it and claim the funds.

21,000,000 is just the natural limit of starting with a 50 BTC block reward (which in itself was somewhat arbitrary but he needed to pick a reasonable figure) and cutting it in half every 4 years.  They are released to the market in terms of a mining reward every 10 minutes when someone solves a block.  Currently the mining reward is 12.5 bitcoin per block but that will be cut in half again in 2020.

It's not primarily about fees although that is a nice bonus for them. 
 Bitmain (the largest manufacturer of mining chips) is using something known as covert ASICboost to give them an additional 20% efficiency savings over their competitors which translates into huge profits since margins are so thin in mining.  Segwit would prevent them from being able to use ASICboost anymore which is why they oppose it.  
They know Segwit + LN would be a huge upgrade for bitcoin but it would force them to compete on an even playing field again so they are doing everything they can think of to block it including sockpuppet armies, pushing alternative implementations that do not break ASICboost, buying prominent figures and businesses in the community, threatening other miners that they supply chips to, etc.  
Edit:  Our only path to activating Segwit seems to be UASF.  Support it.  
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:58:48
I said  *possibly*.  Also, you don't know that for certain, no one does at this point as many things are still in development and will not be able to be fully tested until SW is active.  
For example sidechains could essentially allow for unlimited scaling with 2-way pegs but we need to fix malleability first.  Lets implement SW, gather the data and then determine the best course of action, if it is clear that a HF to raise maxblocksize is necessary at that point because we have exhausted all other options then it will have broad support.

As you said, we would only get a negligible capacity increase from him not mining empty blocks (on the order of 0.5% by your estimation).  We would get a 100%+ capacity increase however (through SW &amp; LN) if he can be convinced to stop blocking segwit activation.  As I said though, there is probably no reasoning with him, his ASICboost profits are too enticing so we will have to activate it without him via UASF.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:24:25
The way this is written these would be activated in parallel which would mean the HF would happen first on a 6 month timeline since change the version bit on segwit would push it out by another year

I'm not sure I understand the question but will give it a shot.  Normally your wallet would display a QR code for your receiving/deposit address (also known as the public key), this is what you would show/send to someone if you were requesting payment from them, they would scan it and send the bitcoins to that address (alternatively you can just send them the actual address as opposed to the QR).  If you scan a QR someone else has sent you it should display the address which you can then look up using a [block explorer](  
In order to check/withdraw funds you would log into your wallet which should display your balance, and from there you can send your funds to whatever address you would like (sending funds should be protected by some version of password/pin/2FA for security purposes, you should enable that in the settings if it isn't by default).  
Does that answer your question?

not sure why you would think that.  that agreement changes the signalling bit for segwit which would delay it by about a year.  BIP148 will activate it in August.  Plus there is no rushed hard fork attached to BIP148 (which would only include the 2MB increase instead of the multitude of wish list items).  It's a waste of a hard fork and way too risky on such a short timeline.

The minority chain (BIP148 segwit) has no risk of reorg out of existence, the majority (legacy no segwit) chain does, so miners would be taking a huge risk by mining that chain as all their block rewards could disappear if the minority chain **ever** reaches 51%.  And because of this risk they will be highly incentivized to switch over and get it to 51%, simple game theory.  
I will be continuing to support BIP148 until segwit is activated, if they can accomplish segwit activation using lighsword's plan before August 1st then great, if not, it's UASF business as usual.

If you divide any number in half an infinite number of times you will never truly reach zero but at a certain point (I think 8 decimal places) the reward is cut off by the software.  Difficulty can vary (although it has been on a general exponential trend upwards as more miners join the network and hardware improves) however the reward for new found blocks will continue to decrease by half every 4 years regardless of the difficulty.

I agree and think basically his point is that someone has to participate of their own free will in order to make that final confirmation, otherwise all the traditional evidence in the world still just ends up as speculation.  
For example I think Craig could legitimately be Satoshi and has known that if he was ever exposed that he can always fail to provide Genesis keys and doubt will remain.  Claiming to want credit and then being "debunked" as unable to confirm would make a nice cover as we move on to the next candidate.

If everyone were able to generate those sort of guaranteed returns then everyone would, and at a massive scale.  The reality is that the difficulty adjusts based on the hash rate (total mining power) until only the most efficient miners (economy of scale, access to asics chip fabs, nearly free electricity, etc.) are able to operate in the black, the rest of us will end up spending more on electricity and mining gear than we will earn in bitcoin to the point that it would have been a better investment to just buy bitcoin outright.

@_date: 2017-05-16 14:24:51
I still am confused why we haven't seen a BIP for disabling covert ASICboost yet after Greg's proposal.  I feel like that should be the absolute first step and should be entirely non-contentious.  To be followed immediately by BIP149, which may not even be necessary at that point because once covert AB is broken there will either be no more incentive to block SW or the miners not running AB will be incentivized to activate SW to remove the advantage from their competitors who are running AB.

Ethereum has already had a chain split, much higher inflation schedule I believe, lots of issues with Turing completeness, Bitcoin has network effect, etc.  I personally don't consider it a threat to bitcoins dominance, it's an alt and may have a use case but I don't think it's a viable store of value long term.  This is just my personal opinion however.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:32:48
I dont read that from the statement, my understanding is that lightsword made his BIP as a result of the statement as a way to potentially activate it without having 2 segwit implementations.  I support lightsword's plan but I am very jaded at this point about anything relying on miner signalling.  I will be continuing to support BIP148 until segwit is activated, if they can accomplish that using lighsword's plan, great, if not, UASF business as usual.

I guess I am not sure how to properly answer your question as I dont have experience with your situation.  I would check the exchange list above, btc-e would probably be your best bet for accepting wires from multiple sources with minimum AML/KYC.  After the fiat is on the exchange you can purchase bitcoins and transfer them wherever.  I believe most ATMs require some level of KYC, so maybe localbitcoins would be a better option for conversion back to fiat.  Sorry if that is not the info you are looking for, perhaps someone else will chime in with a better answer for you.

Have you looked at the [stickied FAQ](
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:31:54
If the hashrate of the 148 chain is only 10% at activation then once the difficulty adjustment occurs they will have even more reason to switch over as they will have a much larger relative percentage of the total hashrate on the 148 chain and mine blocks much faster than on the legacy chain until the next adjustment, plus no potential issue of losing their block reward on the 148 chain during reorg (although if they waited until the first difficulty adjustment after the split to switch to 148 chain they would be risking their block rewards on the legacy chain that they earned between the split and the first difficulty adjustment).  I think they would cascade over quickly, probably before activation even, just from game theory to avoid losing their block rewards.  
[This]( is the best support tracker that I am aware of.  We should all start contacting exchanges directly (email, twitter, etc.) to get them to take a position asap, this has the potential to snowball if only a few of the big exchanges pledge support.  
UASF (whether in the form of 148 or 149) is the only way we are going to get segwit because of ASICboost.  I think it is worth it to give 148 a chance to succeed and fall back to 149 if necessary.  Regardless we should be enforcing protocol upgrades through BIP8 going forward so miners can only accelerate activation of upgrades, not stop them.

no matter the answer I give at different points in history it would have been amazing advice or a huge return killer.  I mean I want to say lump sum is the way to go, it's how I basically did it however if I had gone all-in at the peak of the 2013 bubble I would have severely crippled my returns.  By the same token, if I had dollar cost averaged in 2012 through 2014 I would have been much worse off than if I had just gone all-in in 2012, so there really is no correct answer to your question, it is about market timing, if you dont want to chance that then dollar cost average is a more conservative approach.

@_date: 2017-05-25 15:05:28


This is incorrect.  Satoshi wanted a decentralized system unable to be censored or shut down and he created bitcoin specifically for that purpose.  Large blocks threaten this principal due to the resource requirements for scaling on chain and the impact it would have on node and miner centralization.  If satoshi was ok with that level of centralization he could have just used something like paypal and not invented bitcoin in the first place.  The "bigger/power users" who advocate for small blocks are trying to make sure bitcoin stays decentralized and censorship resistant, they realize that scaling to levels that would support a global population will have to happen as a layer 2 implementation.

Bitcoin is deflationary and designed to increase in value relative to fiat (which is inflationary and printed at will) if you can aquire enough Bitcoin you can theoretical live in perpetuity if you can spend less than the relative value increase.

It will be over once BIP148 activates, not before.  
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:40:40
Segwit most definitely will happen, ideally the miners will come around but if not UASF will activate it eventually.  It's the HF that is definitely not happening.  The small block (pro-decentralization, pro-security, digital gold) camp is fine with Bitcoin in its current state for use as a store of value even with higher fees so there is no incentive to accept a HF.  
The big block crowd **needs** a HF in order to centralized power/control which is why you see them proposing a new HF under a different name after each one fails.  Coffee on chain is just dumb, we need a rock solid base layer for security, we can build micro transactions on top of that.  Putting everything on the main chain weakens security for everyone and threatens the very existence of Bitcoin.

Satoshi released a protocol for distributed consensus.  The first practical application of which is a currency because an agreed value ledger is the basis for all forms of money.  A currency that is not controlled by any single party or nation state will eventually win as the only viable global option because any currency controlled by any one entity would never be agreed on by the remaining parties as a long term solution.  
The protocol is the basis upon which all improvements and applications can be built, the [Lightning network]( ([Whitepaper]( and [Powerpoint]( and [Sidechains]( ([Whitepaper]( are both being actively developed as scalable solutions to handle transactions on a global scale.
I think Satoshi knew that his protocol had the potential to become the one global currency.  There is a reason bitcoin is decentralized, it is the next iteration in a long standing attempt to create digital gold (which holds the ideal properties of a currency; scarcity, fungibility, durability, divisibility and portability) and it's the first one that worked because all of the previous attempts were shut down by governments because they were centralized.  
These attempts at a digital gold threatened governments monopoly on the issuance of currency and those in power were not willing to allow that monopoly to be threatened.  The game changer in this case with bitcoin is decentralization as there is not one entity to target and shut down similar to the RIAA/MPAA's attempts to eliminate bittorrent. Bitcoin will win in the end because it is open source and able to adapt to any external threat, continuing to improve over time without being able to be shut down.

If they go with BIP149 they dont have to meet the 2MB HF demands, they can just activate segwit and then at a future date do the HF they really want with the wishlist items (and possibly include a 2MB bump because they feel it is prudent, not because they were forced into it). 
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:59:43
If their investments suffer from full blocks then they did not do their due diligence to assess the reality of the situation prior to investing.  No amount of corporate tears is going to change the fact that there will be no HF until after Segwit.  Full stop.

he's saying because we don't accept this ambiguous closed door deal with open arms *we* are the ones blocking progress even though we've been pleading with the miners for segwit activation for years.  That's rich.  
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:53:46
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:13:25
No, scaling on chain in his context means increasing the block size via a hard fork (from the current 1MB cap to 2MB or more).  This is unnecessary and dangerous because we can get to approximately 2MB block size without a hard fork (it can be done by a soft fork which is much safer) via Segwit.  Think of it as adding a second container for transactions instead of increasing the size of your original container. 
Not only can Segwit be done via soft fork but it also fixes the current transaction malleability bug which will allow for layer 2 scaling solutions like Lightning network with near free and instantaneous transactions.     
Side chains are separate blockchains which would have a 2 way peg to bitcoin, good for experimentation on new parameters (like faster blocks, etc.) without affecting bitcoin's tested and trusted settings.  
While it would be great if miners would just get on board with activating Segwit, it is obvious at this point we are going to have to force the activation if we ever want to see bitcoin scale to layer 2 solutions without risking decentralization and security in the process.  The process to make this happen is called UASF (User Activated Soft Fork).  You can read more here.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:15:33
Not only that, if they want the SW activation and 2MB HF to proceed in parallel then the HF would happen **before** segwit due to the version bit change and 6 month timeline (?!) on the 2MB HF.  Fuck that.  
@_date: 2017-07-24 02:34:16
This.  A single issue HF is just stupid.

The person you are purchasing bitcoin from will scan your wallet address QR code in order to send bitcoin to your wallet address.  Whatever wallet software you are using should show a pending receipt of bitcoin to that address within moments of him sending it.  


A wallet can contain numerous transactions just like your bank account processes numerous transactions but still display your current balance.  The bitcoin wallet works the same way, it stores the transaction information for all bitcoin sent and received and displays the total balance of your public address that contains the bitcoin.  
If you want to move from one wallet to another just scan the QR code of the address generated from the new wallet and send all your bitcoin to the new address (it's generally a good idea to do a test transaction first before sending large amounts though as the process is irreversible).

There is no such thing as stable prices in bitcoin, at least in the mid term.  Stability makes it a good store of value which leads to investment which leads to price rise which leads to FOMO which leads to bubble.  Then the pop, loss of interest, stability, repeat.

With a wallet you generate a seed phrase and control your own private keys.  If you store your coins with coinbase they are essentially coinbase's coins that you are asking permission to access, if you control your keys then you alone decide when/where they move.

Ethereum hard forked because their was a bug in the way the DAO contract was written allowing the hacker to "steal" millions of dollars worth of eth.  The community didn't like that they just lost a lot of money and forked to a separate chain where the "theft" was not possible resulting in 2 version of ethereum.  
If Bitcoin hard forks it will be to upgrade the protocol with uniform consensus and should not result in a chain split.

You're doing great.  You would be buying actual Bitcoin that you can send to your Ledger/Trezor.  
@_date: 2015-03-23 03:57:46
There is no need or competitive advantage to create a different distributed ledger as any features which are an improvement on bitcoin can be implemented in bitcoin itself due to its open source nature.  It is a protocol that enables trustless consensus between untrusted parties, cannot be shut down, can be updated as needed and has huge network effect in terms of adoption, there is no displacing it at this point.  
To use your analogy it would be like trying to build a better airplane without using the principals of the wing.

Wallets are free, you just download them.  Once you purchase from coinbase you can send your coins wherever you want, to your personal wallet, your friends wallet, a retailer, etc.  You would just need the wallet address (also known as public key or public address) of the recipient to send them to.  
@_date: 2016-10-09 15:41:09
I haven't used electrum but I think password is good practice, in case someone else got access to your computer they wouldn't be able to take your bitcoins.  The 12 word seed should restore your funds regardless of password I believe so keep it very safe and don't store it online.

if you got tipped $1, withdrawl to a mobile wallet you control (mycelium for android or breadwallet for iOs are good bets).  From there you can spend at the retailers listed above or if you wanted to convert it to local currency localbitcoins.com would work except $1 is a pretty small amount for someone to bother with.  
You can link you bank account through various onramps (coinbase, circle, etc.) that will allow you to convert directly to fiat in you account but even then $1 might not cover normal bank fees.  The friction is getting from fiat ---&gt; BTC, once you're holding crypto moving money is easy.

It comes down to Austrian vs Keynesian economic theory.  Basically if something is printed endlessly it is eventually so common it becomes worthless.  See Zimbabwean $100 trillion dollar note that couldn't buy a loaf of bread.  
If someone has all the bitcoins they would be worthless because they wouldn't be able to exchange them with anyone as there would be no demand, the block reward was designed to make sure they were fairly distributed.  It's not a possibility​ worth seriously exploring.

Changing the segwit deployment to bit 4 will [delay it by a year]( unless they can somehow make [lightsword's proposal]( work but that still relies on miner signalling which I have basically given up on.  I will be continuing to support BIP148 until segwit is activated, if they can accomplish that using lighsword's plan, great, if not, UASF business as usual.

Bitstamp could loosely be considered a wallet but you wouldn't be using them for regular transactions, they are really just an exchange.  
It is recommended you don't store your Bitcoin anywhere that you don't have control over your private keys.  Bitcoin stored on bitstamp is really just an IOU from bitstamp for the coins.  
Depending on how much value you have in coins you should either be moving them to a mobile wallet like mycelium or breadwallet (for small amounts) or to a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger (for larger amounts) for more secure storage.

The protocol has been [updated many times]( and is still being actively developed (even if some would like the pace to be faster), it is open source so anyone can review its fundamentals and contribute to development of the core protocol (or fork it and attempt to do better on their own, but as I mentioned previously that would be pointless, any improvements kept closed source would not be adopted and open source would just be integrated, which is actually why Altcoins are such a good testing ground but all individually doomed to fail, especially with the rise of sidechains which will allow for experimentation without the need for speculation).  
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:51:39

The bitcoin would be in the wallet of whatever exchange you buy them from initially.  From there you can move them to the wallet of your choice, coinbase or anything else, however I would recommend choosing a wallet where you generate a seed phrase and control your own private keys.  If you store your coins with coinbase they are essentially coinbase's coins that you are asking permission to access, if you control your keys then you alone decide when/where they move.

2017 July 23 18:00 GMT — BIP91 epoch finishes, BIP91 is activated
2017 July 23 18:00 GMT onward — Every block signals BIP141 (Segwit)
2017 July 27 or thereabouts — New Difficulty Adjustment Period Begins (2016 blocks). Every block will be signaling for Segwit.
2017 August 1 00:00 GMT — BIP148 starts, but does nothing since every block is signaling BIP141 due to BIP91.
2017 August 10 or thereabouts — Difficulty Adjustment Period closes with &gt;95% signaling and BIP141 locks-in.

While I don't think they actually started denying transactions and withdrawals have resumed it would be to their own detriment if they decide to do that, people would just route around them to exchanges without censorship.  Fungibility cannot be impinged upon, if you own the private keys, the bitcoin are yours no matter how you obtained them.

Software wallets are free and are fine to store anything up to $1000 or so.  Hardware wallets are around $100 or so and should be used once you are storing larger amounts.  I would set up an account on an exchange like coinbase, bitstamp, kraken, etc. and begin dollar cost averaging, making small regular purchases that you can afford without impact to your budget.

There will be no 2MB HF.  We will activate segwit with BIP148 and then we will have ample layer 2 scaling for years to come.  A hard fork will come in time but it will be to include the wishlist items along with a reasonable blocksize increase, not because of some closed room proclamation.

It wouldn't be considered money if one person had all of them, you need an economy​ in order for it to have value, one person holding all the coins does not an economy create.  
If you lost your bitcoins you can consider it a donation to the value of the coins for rest of the holders out there.  No more will be created, there would just be less in circulation.

@_date: 2016-07-06 10:56:39
Good question.  Basically the margins are so thin on mining these days that you have to have an edge in order to make money, either nearly free electricity (hydroelectric, geothermal, subsidized, etc), access to the newest chip fabs (know some guys in Chinese ASIC production), economy of scale (think multi million dollar server farms), and be constantly reinvesting in new more efficient gear, etc.  Ideally all of the above.  
If you just go online and order some hot new $10k mining rig thinking you are going to compete with the big boys most likely it will be obsolete by the time it arrives at your door and will mine less bitcoin over its lifespan that you would have received if you just bought $10k worth of coins on the open market.  
That's why mining centralization has become a concern, the margins are so small that only people with millions to invest can be competitive.

Step 1) Understand that scaling Bitcoin on chain has direct impacts on decentralization.
Step 2) Understand that hard forks are very dangerous for the network and open up further attack vectors.
Step 3) Realize that a HF is entirely unneeded and that Bitcoin can scale with soft forks for a long time (possibly forever)
Step 4) Return to the ranks of those who advocate for sensible upgrades to the protocol without risking destroying it or turning it into centralized PayPal in the process. 
But who am I kidding, you probably won't get past step 1.

If two people have the same private keys ithey would have access to the same wallet and either could move the coins just as if there were two sets of keys to the same safe.

I wasn't aware that breadwallet had a purchase option, buying coins is generally the function of an exchange but it's a grey area.  
It's more secure in the sense that you control your coins and aren't exposing yourself to the risk of Coinbase for example getting hacked and losing funds, going out of business, running away with user funds in an exit scam, being served a government order to take your coins, etc.  While unlikely, all of this is still third party risk that you assume when you don't control your private keys.  What you have from Coinbase/Gemini is essentially an IOU for your coins, not the coins themselves until they are under your control.  
When you choose to store your coins on your own with something like breadwallet, the onus is on you to properly secure the seed words for your wallet and make sure no one else can access them and steal your funds.  You are taking personal responsibility of your account security.  
There are tradeoffs to each method (using bitcoin banks vs. be your own bank) which is why they are both listed.  In the end it is your decision.

BIP141 is the original release of segwit however it is currently activated using BIP9 which requires 95% hashrate which obviously isn't going to happen.

Since all miners on BIP148 will be signalling segwit it will get triggered with 100% signalling according to BIP9

A paper wallet is a reasonably secure way to store coins long term assuming you have accounted for things like fire, theft, paper quality, and secure generation (an airgapped computer with frest linux install is ideal).  All a paper wallet is is a public/private key pair generated securely.  You send bitcoins that you purchased on an exchange to the public address of the paper wallet where they will remain until you import the paper wallet into a spending wallet (like a mobile or desktop wallet) using the private key.  
If you are not very technical and doubt you can generate it securely I would recomment getting either a trezor or ledger hardware wallet which should be much simpler and should have equal if not better security.

Coinbase and Gemini are exchanges meaning you can purchase coins there.  They will hold them for you until you decide to transfer the coins to your personal wallet (like breadwallet).

I still think it's still too soon to rip the bandaid off (not that we have any say in the matter really, it happens when it happens), lets continue converting merchants, billpay services, exchanges, etc. (not to mention getting segwit activated!) so when society is forced over to bitcoin they can at least transact and pay for their necessary goods and services.

You are either mistaken or are pushing an agenda.  I suppose it hasn't occurred to you that they might know just a little bit more about how to safely scale Bitcoin than you do?  There is unanimous consensus in core that segwit is the path forward and [near unanimous consensus among node operators]( that core is the best software.

Don't be shocked by several hundred dollar moves either way but personally I think Bitcoin is one of the best investment opportunities of all time in terms of risk/reward and we are all still early adopters.  Anyone who has held longer than a month or so is in profit at this point but you should definitely think of it as a long term investment.  I held all the way through the 2014-2016 dry spell and acquired more during that time.  It was a wise move in hindsight but the general advice here is don't risk more than you're willing to lose.  Bitcoin will most likely either be worth 10x+ what it is today or nothing within 10 years.

I quoted you directly and you are now attempting to change your statement.   Whatever.  
Running the BIP148 chain is voluntary.  These users are choosing not to accept blocks from miners who don't accept segwit.  That is their choice.  No one is threatening anyone.  
POW change has only ever been discussed in the context of defending the BIP148 chain from a miner attack. 


The **only** reason Luke is running 148 is for the technical activation of segwit.

Spare me.  I would absolutely love it if we could scale on chain without centralizing, that would be **awesome** because I love p2p cash as much as the next guy, in fact I love it so much that I don't want to risk losing it entirely which is why we can't risk a HF when there is a well tested solution with developer consensus ready to be activated.

As long as your wallet is compatible with BIP32 for hierarchial deterministic address generation, i.e. they provide you with a word string for account recovery when you generate you wallet then you would be able to import your coins into any other BIP32 compatible wallet even if the original wallet shut down.

Nice straw man shill.  No, I want the entire globe to be able to grow their wealth **AND** have cheap transactions which is why we will activate segwit and not allow an unnecessary and reckless HF.  The only reason we have high fees is due to the miner blockade of tested upgrades to the protocol.  If high fees are how it has to be because they would rather stonewall Bitcoin than help it evolve then so be it but we will not endanger it with a HF when segwit is tested and ready to go.  
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:24:11


Data.  Increasing blocksize has been shown repeatedly to increase node requirements, storage cost and miner influence all of which lead to monopolistic control and central points of failure.  Bitcoin is worth nothing once easily co-opted or shut down by governments.   In addition, hard forks are pointless when scaling via soft fork is tested and ready for activation.  
Core and Blockstream have always maintained the FOSS ethos.  Node operators are free to run whatever software they want and 84% of those choose to run core.   Anyone who is unhappy with the free open source software they are provided with is welcome to develop their own client or submit improvements via BIP.   
Most are very comfortable running "blockstreamcore" software however because essentially all of the top crypto developers on the planet are in agreement that segwit is the correct path forward for scaling, the only question​ is the activation method.  Thankfully they recognize that optimizations through soft fork take priority over unnecessarily risky hard forks.    
Segwit **will** get activated before a hard fork. 
Core assumed miner incentives would align with their own however they miscalculated, it doesn't really matter though, miners can only delay upgrades not stop them, bitcoin has a habit of routing around those who would block progress.  
Users will activate with or without miner support because they can choose of their own free will what they are willing to accept as legitimate Bitcoin, miners will very soon find themselves with nothing new to sell to users and their existing holdings significantly depreciated if they continue to stonewall.  


Their proposals were shown to be centralizing so they were rejected by their peers.  They chose of their own free will to stop contributing to the BIP process.  


Share with us your definition of "nothing at stake" in regards to lightcoin's market cap.




I'm glad we're in agreement. 




A nice quote from one of the 75% "supporting" segwit;
"Increasing the block size would mean that top miners would be incentivized to push the block size even more, to push out some of their competition. Some miners wouldn’t have the computing power, or it wouldn’t be cost efficient for them to process larger and larger blocks, so they would retire.
Repeat that process slowly, kicking out a low percentage of miners each time, and you would have taken over Bitcoin. You would own and control it. It’s true that even if that happens, miners couldn’t do certain things — for example they can’t fake a transaction for you. But they could double spend, meaning that the currency is worthless."


Bitcoin is already a useable, valuable​ network as shown from rising transaction fees.  People would not be paying for these use cases if they did not find them worthwhile.


Bullshit.  They can activate segwit, or we will.  They can also activate their 2MB hard fork anytime they want.  There is a reason they don't.

I wonder why?


Like I said just trying to waste ppls time.  You claim to be a reformed small blocker who has seen the error of your ways, yet provided none of said data which changed your mind or proof of your original positions.  Again calling BS.  


Core takes a very empirical stance on scaling solutions and BIPs, they are the definition of open minded, if your ideas went nowhere it's because your ideas were bad and could not garner support on their own merit.  


This is because they are exploiting the protocol and will continue to do so until forced to stop.  


I guess your definition of something at stake is somewhere in excess of $1.5 Billion.  
The real question here is whether segwit is an improvement to the protocol or not.  If so it should be activated on its own merit.  Whether or not LN works as a long term solution is irrelevant.  HF to larger blocksize will always be an option if LN doesn't work for any reason.
