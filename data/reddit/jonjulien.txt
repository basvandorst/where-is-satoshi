It does... thanks, though bitbet is definitely nicer. Hmmm...

tl;dr: no relation.
Yeah, you're right, it is confusing, which is unfortunate. I wasn't aware of bitbet.us while developing this site. And I really need money right now. So I can't take it down just because of a name conflict.
I'll be changing the name as soon as a good one comes to mind.

Yes, and many have, though the wager count is lower than I would like.
What's so far-fetched about this? Sure, I could change it to i.e. "send bitcoins to X address to place a bet; winnings will be sent to you." But then there are two transactions for every wager. That's pretty wasteful when it comes to transaction fees, especially with small wagers.

There's no way to prove lack-of-ownership. And unfortunately, my narcissism doesn't permit a name change.
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:00:22
Thanks, yeah. So far it seems that most people register and log out before betting anything - never to return. But I guess that's understandable. 
We'll see how it goes.

At the moment, no. I'm simply reading from /dev/urandom.
Within a day or two, I will have finished implementing a provably fair system. I'll post an update then.
@_date: 2015-02-19 08:48:53
Yeah.... I haven't come up with any good alternatives, unfortunately.

Wow, those are some humbling statistics. I'd like to see an ordered bar graph of bitcoin address balances, just to visualize the heavy tail.
@_date: 2015-02-23 04:21:58
It does, yes.
"my dollar is worth 4000 bits"

First of all, this is great. Thank you! 
Plenty of people want to contribute to the network, but don't have the means to do so directly. You've lowered the barrier to entry dramatically. 
That said, there is a scalability problem here. The demand for services like this is enormous - so enormous, I think, that you'll end up in control of more nodes than the Bitcoin community would like to see in one person's hands.
I don't mean to doubt your integrity specifically - this is just a general bit of weariness.
Would you be willing to open source fullnode? That would make it really easy for others to duplicate your service, thereby amortizing my concerns.
Again, thanks you. This is great.

Thank you!

It is now. Check it out, if you'd like.

FYI, I am not associated with bitbet.cc. That came up in another thread.

That is an insane statistic. Reminds me of of the line: "all currencies are pyramid schemes", which is entirely true, at least in function. While Bitcoin and friends may have the best of intentions, we are paving the road for hyper-extreme wealth inequality.
Regardless, I'm a full-fledged supporter of Bitcoin. The technology is worth its downsides.
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:02:43
Agreed, though I don't expect much. Gavin Andresen's days running a Bitcoin sink are long gone.

Check this out: 
It isn't perfectly relevant to locking away Bitcoins (though it was build by a Bitcoin Core developer, Peter Todd), but instead, timelocking in general.
The biggest problem I see with your suggested algorithm (extra characters on passphrase) is that parallelization would shorten the timelock period. A better option would be a cryptographic puzzle whose solution is most easily found through sequential computation, so more parallel computers of the future can't be of as much an effect.

OP here.
I have no relationship with bitbet.cc, though I'd love to get my hands on that domain name.
