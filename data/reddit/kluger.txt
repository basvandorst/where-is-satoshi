I always hear people on here saying "I want it to drop so I can buy more".. I really feel that now.. I own a business and sold .3 bitcoin last week to pay for a job I was doing, I made money, but I would have made more if I just kept my bitcoin.. So I want it to get back to around 10300 again so I can buy it all back and more. And I want it to just be a bit stable for a while so I can accumulate more bitcoin.  I need the bull run to wait until like october, then it can shoot up to 100k.
Yeah I'm really loving todays dip

Hey so people keep telling me not to store my bitcoin on coinbase... So I got a bitpay wallet and sent it there.. Also kind of so i could use a bitpay card. But is bitpay a good option? Should I be using something better like mycellium or whatever? And if so why?
@_date: 2019-07-08 17:37:32
Hmm.. No info for russia? Also what prevents coinbase or kraken etc.. From being global? Is it regulations or do they not trust banks in some of those countries? Seems like all you need is to link your bank account. What about cashapp? Is cashapp global?

Is this yesterdays 400 dollar spike? Your thing doesn't tell me the time in relation to my time PST. 
I miss , if there was ever a big spike in the SPY you could just go to the daily discussion and it's pretty much all they'd be talking about. Here you get a lot of HODL! And stuff but not a lot of speculation, in fact I think people who speculate here get downvoted. 
I like this post, I want to know the movements. I want to know when. Huge sell order is put in or when a huge buy order is put in. When there's a spike 8n the graph I want to know why, or I want to hear some juicy speculation. Yeah here when people speculate about short term moves, people just pipe in with "you got to be in it for the long term , stop talking about short term. Only gamble what you can afford to loose. It might go to 4k tomorrow it might go to 20k.. Blah blah long term" its annoying nonsense. We all know how to be sensible.. We come to forums to speculate, not get advice from our dad

Yeah, I wish I had known how to put 10 dollars a week into btc 9yrs ago.. I knew about bitcoin but thought you had to mine it yourself.. I used my shitty laptop to try to mine bitcoin.. I don't think I ever got anything... Although I might have .3 bitcoin on a laptop in my garage
@_date: 2019-11-20 19:03:58
My question is: how would you buy bitcoin back then? When I first heard about it, i think it was 6 cents and I thought you had to mine it, so I downloaded the mining program or whatever on filehippo and spent like weeks checking to see if I got anything. I think I have a laptop in the garage with either .3 or .03 bitcoin. I gave up on it.. If I had known how to buy it I would've tossed a Hundred bucks in the ring. But I had no clue you could buy it.. That's my major regret, I wanted it, didn't really have the equipment to mine so I gave up on it..
It's not like I was poor or anything, I would have at least put a hundred bucks in.. I just had no fucking clue where you could buy it. I honestly thought it was meant to be a mine it yourself currency.

no no no...anonymity is a good thing.. I'm wondering whats this means.. like can' they flag bitcoin somehow? or blacklist wallets? or somehow know that you took money from a criminal, and they come and ask you why the criminal sent you bitcoin? yeah and the IRS really working hard to deanonymize bitcoin is definitely something that worries me... I mean yeah, this story is alright for sure.. like of course awesome that they saved 23 minors from current ongoing abuse..
 but I'm definitely not a fan of them being able to track people down using bitcoin..  like one of the things I like about bitcoin is  you can have a go bag with all your money in it, on a small hardware wallet... but does this mean I could be found anywhere in the world because they can track my transactions? just like using a visa card? this definitely makes me like bitcoin less.. although I still have no clue how bitcoin works

USD aren't worth shit for cashing out into... If you're talking about holding for 5 -10 yrs, presumably we'd be past mass adoption and you wouldnt want USD.. In 5-10 years you're going to need 20usd or more to buy a 5 dollar footlong from subway.. You don't want that trash. I am however holding 53,000 dogecoin on robinhood. But yeah you're thinking small, usd wont be something you want in 5 - 10 yrs.. It would be like still wanting DeutschMarken, open your mind

Any way to have money direct deposited and automatically transferred into btc? I'm going to be on a boat in the bering sea over the next 6 months or so, and I want to buy bitcoin when i get payed but not always sure when I'll get paid and will rarely have access to internet.. I know I can do automatic purchases with coinbase.. But I don't think I'll know when I'll get paid, because it's based off when we sell the fish.
I won't really need any money for the next six months, so I would rather just put all my pay into btc.. So essentially get paid with btc.
@_date: 2019-10-10 08:15:37
anyone got any info on cloud mining? so I'm using [IQmining.com]( and it seems I'm paying half of my mining income in maintenance fees..  I bought 3000 gh/s and everyday I make  0.0000588 BTC  and then I pay   0.0000349 BTC  for maintenance.. is this normal? like it's more than half... so, what's the best deal out there? like it cost me around 150 for 3000gh/s and in two months I've made like 11 dollars or .00135 btc.. when I've actually mined .0027btc.. I'm starting to feel like maybe I wasted my money.. and the contract is good for two years.. anyone invest in any worthwhile mining?

it will have no store of value if it has no value. it's value is in its efficacy as a currency.  it can't be a store of value if it can't be used. the first market to really adopt bitcoin was obviously the dark web, and I mean mass adoption. what happens if that market rejects bitcoin? there's still people using bitcoin out in the light of day obviously, but it has to lose some value being as it's no longer being used in that market at all.  I mean it still is hopefully, but this was pretty big news. a dark web vendor went down, and brought all of their clients down with them. I mean yeah sure it's a good thing. but it brings to light that it can be used very effectively to track people. I mean like 300 people were arrested because they followed the transactions which were on a public ledger

Hey I'm on that site trying to play poker what is mbtc?
@_date: 2019-10-16 05:55:44
does hodling count as using it? I mean I'm using it to store my value... although I have lost like 3000 dollars in the last month because of that. I direct deposit my money into coinbase, and then use my bitpay card for pretty much everything, so I use it almost everyday.. and when possible I purchase things online with bitcoin, I buy kratom with bitcoin, my buddy buys steroids from turkey with bitcoin... you can pay for russian escorts in the US with bitcoin... tonnes of uses. I honestly try to use it as much as possible, but the uses are still somewhat limited.. with a bitpay card you can spend it, but you're really selling bitcoin and spending USD.. I own a business and accept bitcoin, although no one has ever paid with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-21 17:08:31
I like to spend it every chance I get.. But i keep turning usd in btc and then back to usd.. And i use a bitpay card for a lot of transations. The way I see it is if you keep and use usd you're losing money.. Its inflationary the usd has devalued by 2000 percent in the last hundred years.. They systematically began stealing our silver and gold.. They took the silver out of our coinage.. About now if you wanted to buy a steel washer the size of a quarter it might cost a quarter or it will soon. They re just steel and paper. Sounds like you're saying spend usd save btc.. But ultimately i say avoid usd as much as possible and save and spend btc
@_date: 2019-10-19 23:39:59
I'd say there's a difference in the fact that all of the banks would have to be individually subpoenaed.. right?  bitcoin is public record. I'm sure they had to subpeona coinbase to give out the information, but still bitcoin transactions are on a public ledger. bank transactions aren't public they have to give it up.
@_date: 2019-10-20 01:04:25
it's not narrow minded. I'm saying it's value is in it's use as a currency.  I'm not saying that it's use in the dark web is it's sole source of value. I'm saying the fact that it's being used in the dark web *demonstrates* it's value. if it can no longer be used in the dark web that would diminish it's value. it's like if the dollar stopped being used by governments to buy and sell oil, the dollar would still be used in the US blah blah blah, but it would diminish the value. if people are afraid to use bitcoin for illicit goods for fear of being tracked and recorded, well it loses value.  I mean drugs globally are a trillion dollar industry, if you can't buy drugs with bitcoin, then it loses value, not to mention all the other illicit shit out there. I mean dark web vendors are the pioneers of using bitcoin as a currency.

@_date: 2019-10-19 23:34:23
you don't need to tell me to relax, I was using it as an example. 
the point is, is bitcoin makes every transaction a matter of public record. with banks at least the government has to subpoena the information. my point is, bitcoin is the least anonymous form of payment. cash is completely anonymous, you have to declare cash transactions. with bitcoin any wallet known to be used in any illegal activity has a public ledger of every wallet that ever transferred coin into it. and not even governments, everyone can see. there should be privacy with currency. when wallets are known, then transactions are known.. so you can make a pretty good profile on a person if you know their transactions. employers will research prospective employees transaction histories. wives , whatever. it's just another move into a less private world. and yeah, I'm against that.
people keep saying there are other coins, but I don't think there's any guarantee that alt coins are going to follow bitcoin into acceptance.. hopefully they will. and hopefully monero with it's anonymity will. but then monero will be like the demonized dark web.
it seems to me that bitcoin is a new way of tracking peoples movements, whether they're illegal or not. yeah this recent darkweb kiddie porn thing really brings that to light for me.  if there's a really good database of wallets, you can know a lot about what a person does. even if police aren't prosecuting petty crimes. you can have a pretty good profile of a person. this person saw an escort at 2pm tuesday , ate at mary's diner at 6pm, on saturday bought cocaine and went to the strip club with these people to presumably snort coke of strippers tits.. or like okay here's a list of all the people who ate at mary's diner on thursday.  say your wife knows your wallet number
and you can use the well if you don't do anything illegal you have nothing to hide... well, whatever. privacy is important. and I'm just saying knowing full well the capacity for bitcoin to remove a good deal of privacy from the world.. I'd have to say it concerns me. and I like it less.

Yeah, I mean I said that. But, eventually when bitcoin gets bigger I'm sure at somepoint wallets may have to be publicly registered or whatever.  No longer a need to request informstion it will be publicly known, you wont need receipts you'll hust register your wallet with the IRS.

Yeah but the crash was higher than the run up.. It was sitting like 600 before it went to 20k.. Then it "crashed" to 3k.. Now hopefully it'll run up to 100k and crash down to 20k/30k.. Then float around and do another run up to 1,000,000 and "crash" to 500,000 ... Etc.. If you bought before the spike in 2017 you should still be doing great... Maybe it'll just keep going up this time.. Hopefully. But, if it does crash again the we'll get an all new much higher bottom, I'm hoping the new bottom is like 50k

But who knows, could've just kept mooning til 13000.. I'm not saying I'm being sensible.. I'm just being greedy.. I bought a whole bitcoin when it was at 5000 .. Now I want to start playing with it.

yeah this argument... you only need privacy if you have something to hide.. jesus.. it's a shitty argument. why do I prefer privacy to everything being completely public? you know I really don't know. why don't I live in a glass house? why don't I put the couch and tv in the front yard and just lounge out there while I'm watching tv? what I'm afraid of people seeing me?
 yeah dude, just let google publish all the information they have on you if you feel that way. or apple or whatever. you know your phone if you have the location  setting on keeps a complete record of everywhere you go every day. okay, just give that out publicly. you have nothing to hide. I don't really have much to hide either. I still don't want to have all of my spending habits on a public ledger,  I don't want my location history on a public record, I don't want to be watched at all times, I don't want to live in a glass house.

alright, how many people have we got here? 1.2 million subscribers?

my point is, bitcoin is worse than even credit cards, no subpoena necessary , every time you transfer a bitcoin it's on a public ledger. it's the least anonymous currency ever in the history of time. every little transaction, even buying a pack of gum, will be on a public ledger.. it's kinda fucked up if you ask me.

He's speaking in hyperbole. He's a graph guy, he probably tells his clients he guarantees he can double their money in the first year.. He can't guarantee that. He's over confident, he's an over-confident salesman. This is like whining when someone uses "literally" wrong. Everyone knows he didn't mean "literally" literally. He's confident in his prediction, just like John McAfee. This guy wants people to remember when it hits 50k this year, that he guaranteed it. Can't fault him for that, and if it doesn't he'll eat his hat I'm sure

so with this shutting down of the kiddieporn thing,  shouldn't that effect the use of bitcoin? I mean people like peter schiff say bitcoin really has two uses right now; speculation/investment and illicit trade. so.. I mean that's somewhat true.. I hold bitcoin, and because I believe in it, I try to use it as much as I can...  and the uses are limited, obviously, I'd like to be able to use it for more. but, so far you know I've used it for Kratom and Russian escort girls and my buddy has used it to buy testosterone from poland and turkey. so I mean some illicit things. so with the whole ledger thing, lets say for some reason one of the escort girls gets busted they seize her phone and have her wallet... so when they know her wallet number or whatever, they'll be able to see every wallet that ever sent her coin... it's not like I'm worried about it, it's small time shit. I'm talking about every time they bust some illicit vendor, they're going to know every wallet that ever transfered money to it right? so that kinda fucking makes it no good for illicit trade, which yeah you whiners can say fuck 'em they're criminals.. but it still effects the use.. and if we go mainstream adoption, the fucking IRS is going to know everything. can't even be a small business owner and fudge your books for cash sales.. I mean that's fucked. if anyone should want mainstream adoption it'll be the government.
which that being said, I'm going to continue to invest in it, because I think it'll certainly be pushed forward. but it very certainly isn't the freedom that I hoped for.. it's the fucking dream currency of big brother. yeah, how is it the money of the people?. every thing is recorded, every transaction accounted for. as a small business owner, I very certainly don't  record all my sales, you know? with bitcoin the government, or actually the federal reserve will choose whatever tax rate they want, and no one can hide. yeah, I can't see it as a revolutionary currency anymore.. of course, everyone hates kiddie porn and shit.  but the mass surveilance it offers, is fucking worrisome to say the least.

In 1913 87% of government revenue came from tariffs, now its like 8%.. Support the local economy only get shit like tea and porcelain from china... Maybe opium..

I found a silver quarter in my change jar, 1964. It's apparently worth 3.50 in melt value. I just thought it was crazy to think our money used to have an actual value, not speculative. Not created by the federal reserve deciding it's value. An actual universal value. Now a quarter isnt worth much more than a steel washer..
 I also wondered about back in 1964 what you could buy with a quarter, probably a burger and fries.. Just looked it up, in 1964 you could get a burger, fries and a soda for 47 cents , so two quarters smelted is 7 bucks. Yeah, we pretty much have runaway inflation.. It's like what's the point of saving money for retirement? Can't even do that, have to try to out preform the market so you can even have something to spend. People used to save money, now money is becoming more and more worthless. I bet when i retire in like 20/ 30 years a burger and fries would cost 50 dollars.. Well unless we turn to a noniflationary currency.. So yeah bitcoin

Grass is always greener on the other side. I lived in turkey for a while , I know turkey is quite a bit different and richer than lebanon, but my turkish girlfriend was always telling me how poor and miserable turkish people were, but i didn't see that. I saw some of that especially refugees. But I saw the normal turkish person living better than the average american. My turkish girlfriend was a bartender made 2000 lira a month which at the time was like 400 bucks, she went to the bar after work most nights. Ate fresh food, ate excellent food, had a two bedroom apartment in kadiköy , istanbul. I mean say you want to come to europe or america/canada, you're going to miss food in lebanon. I'm american and I would say try eating a tomato in america, or cucumber, or apricot, or literally fucking anything, our food is garbage, tomatoes aren't recognisable, we pick them when they're green here and spray them with gas to turn them red, but they dont develop flavor. The food here is complete garbage compared to the middle east. Produce especially, seafood too, we have almost no fresh seafood, all been sitting on ships for a week waiting to be frozen by the factory.. And as for the humans that live in america, they're much less friendly, I mean just socially. In my experience of the middle east , it's the best hospitality in the world. People are much closer, much more hugging etc... Here most guys dont hug, like ever, some do but its not hugely common. So if you think things are nicer here, just remember food and people are much worse, things are way more expensive, and we don't make enough to pay for them, when i was in istanbul near the ferries you could get a burger fries and a coke for 3 lira which was about a dollar, good luck getting a burger, fries and a coke in the US for under 10 dollars. So yes we make a lot more money, but our food and clothes and rent, pretty much everything is at least tenfold more expensive and usually of a lower quality, especially food.

I sell Turkish food at events.. like a food vendor.

I think I heard some guy saying oh I definitely have bitcoin, but by the time I got up there the girl had already rung the guy up with fiat.. I think the girls would rather not have to stop doing what they're doing to get me. I'm hoping square gets crypto soon they've been talking about it. or I need to get an app on the ipad.. building a restaurant now and going to get some good signage for crypto, at events I put the mornings crypto price for the daily special on the special board. that's what I've done to try to encourage bitcoin sales

I do what i have to do like rent checks and stuff and big things.. Then i convert to bitcoin and use a bitpay card for extraneous things. And i find it painful to spend bitcoin for shit i don't need, so I'm saving a bit of money on the monthly

I was just saying it was a passing thought.. A foolish strategy to turn my bitcoin into more bitcoin. I could have bought like another .07 if i had sold at 11200 and bought at 10600.. Too risky though.. But there's definitely peaks and valleys. Some people play that game I'm sure. Like for instance the people who have enough money to cause pump and dumps. You notice a few weeks ago for a few days when every day around mid day pst there was a $50,000,000 sell order that tanked the price a bit... I assumed that was someone dumping in order to buy more at a lower price. If I could sell at those peaks and buy the valleys... But, I dont really feel too much like risking it.

50,000 is not decent money, maybe especially on the west coast. I remember seeing somewhere and this was a few years ago that 74,000 was the threshold that got you out of the lower middle class.. Yeah, cars are now 40,000 for hondas.. It used to be that a car should be 1/3 of your anual income and a house should equal your yearly income.. Now people have cars that are almost a full years income and homes that are like 6 yrs... Guy makes 50,000 a year and house where he lives is a million, thats 20yrs salary.. Yeah he might get raises and shit.. People are so fucking dumb to think shits getting more expensive.. Our money is getting cheaper and our wages lower.. People keep whining "give us 15 an hour!".. Doesnt mean shit when 15 won't buy you a cheese burger in a few years... He's right to want to get his money out of the dollar, fuck the dollar, fuck the pound, fuck the euro.. You keep that shit and you wont afford to eat in 5yrs

you're an idiot, your name kinda says it all u/emilywasright  , "I'm right, and the other is wrong" . george bush increases the nation debt "he's evil etc.." , obama increases the national debt more than all previous presidents combined "the system is rigged". George Bush signs the patriot act "he's evil", Obama signs the NDAA "he had to do it, it was for our safety, also the system is rigged"  .. when it's the other, they're at fault, when it's you somehow you had to and you were right no matter what.  wake the fuck up dummy. your presidents fuck this country up just as much or even worse than the conservatives. Obama was a shit president, and you guys are too busy being right all the time to admit it. clinton was a shit president, they're all shit presidents. hilary would have been way worse than trump, we're lucky to have trump, we probably would have been entering wwIII right now under hilary. she wanted to bomb iran, shoot down russian jets over syria, would have never talked to north korea, and also said she'd never talk to Putin... but you guys are too busy being right to admit the damage you cause to the world.

And how do they calculate that? I own a food service business and the cost of food even though still "cheap" is rising insanely fast.. Even a cheap thing like onions, three years ago i could buy a 25lb bag of onions for 6 dollars now its averaging around 14 dollars, not to mention meat prices more than tripling in the last 6 years... People keep saying shit is getting more expensive,  I dont buy that narrative entirely anymore.. The dollar is garbage... What will my stack of 250 dollars buy in five years? What will .024 bitcoin buy in 5 years? What is the actual value? The true value? How much does a potato cost? The dollar keeps saying its more and more.. Bullshit, a potato is a potato. If we were on silver we'd be alright, but we're on imaginary bullshit money that's stealing value from the people. People are whining about 15 an hour.. Okay in three years you'll get 15 an hour, but with the rate of inflation what the fuck does it matter? You'll be buying $10 whoppers from burger king. The dollar doesn't buy shit anymore and people are crying give us more dollars. Fuck that shit. Give us a currency that maintains it's value.. You literally can't save your money anymore, you have to put it in a mutual fund and hope it at least preforms at market rate? How about a currency that holds a real value?  I'm not buying the shit is more expensive every year shit, our dollar is just buying less and less. I've got almost a pound of one dollar bills, and it doesn't mean shit. In the 70s you could buy a new ford truck for 1500 now similar ford would be 40,000.. And we're outsourcing the building of that truck to 3rd world countries... So yeah... Fuck your inflation statistics, do they even sound close to true? I read an article a while ago, and I'm not going to link sources, but someone who made more than a 300 grand a year in the seventies could have a live that takes a billionaire to live in todays money.. I.e. yacht, private jet, multiple houses etc... Today's billionaires are 30, 40 Year's ago 100 thousandaires.. And there's this narrative that, "oh, stuffs just more expensive".. Horseshit, automation , using third world countries to produce our shit, that's supposed to make shit more affordable. Food is more expensive? We have better farm equipment than ever. It's inflation. Profits are higher than ever. It's inflation. That stack of one's was a lot of money even 10 or 20 years ago. 
Honestly out of curiousity, I'd like to ask how those inflation numbers are worked out.. So how? I read somewhere that a 2019 dollar is worth 5 cents compared to a 1920 dollar... But that seems overly fair to the dollar.. So how is it figured?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:28:15
I don't know how that can be true.. average salary in 1980 was 13,000 average cost of a house was 23,000 , now average income is 61,000 and average house just passed 300,000 . so in the 80s a house is 1.75 annual income now it's 4.9  ..  housing increases because of supply and demand, but it bubbles when democrats tell banks they have to approve all loan applications, affordable housing bills.. same with schooling, loans have to be given to students, therefore charge what you will, the debt will just accrue.  the price is determined by how much debt can the person pay off in a lifetime.. there was an old rule that a house should be on par with your annual salary and paid off in 6 yrs, and a car should be 1/3 annual income and bought in cash those are old economics, in he 40s they were still true. but with bank loans backed by the government prices got out of control
@_date: 2019-09-23 02:46:26
Yeah yeah, still count out dollars.. I have a bunch of ones left over from my summer business, went to the store to buy 23 dollars worth of beer last night, it was mildly annoying stuffing each of them into the self check out machine..
And how exactly do they figure 6.19? I think thats at the very least a favorable to the dollar estimate. In 1970 a whopper at burger king was 37 cents, now its about 5 dollars thats an increase of 13.5x . my mom bought her house in 2001 for 110,000 the neighbors house in 1994 was 30,000 . the houses are now valued at over 300,000... 
 I'm starting to doubt the whole "well things just get more expensive" narrative, I think our dollar is just getting watered down (obviously, but more than we really give it thought). In 1964 a silver quarter would buy a burger at mcdonalds, in 2019 that silver quarter will still buy a burger at mcdonalds. A silver quarter has about 4 dollars worth of silver in it. We have a currency that doesn't gain value with the market..  Pretty fucking soon the steel and copper in a quarter will be worth more than the quarter, pennies are already worth less than the metal in them, they're already discussing phasing out the penny, hence the drive for visa and such to take over, our money is going to be too worthless to print.
My point is, big stack of money, and not too much value

Shit man, what's the difference? Ive been just using regular coinbase for 2 yrs.. Have a few bitcoins and move shit around a lot, I notice the fees and okay, but how big of a difference are the pro fees? I mean I may have lost hundreds of dollars over the last couple years without realising..
@_date: 2019-09-23 05:44:49
No, have a food service business.. Part of my left over change from the summer, i close down for the winter.. Also have a stack of 5s and 10s. Just thought that its kinda crazy how such a big stack of dollars buys so little..  I've obviously had a lot more one's too.. I've ordered cloth sacks of ones from the bank before, it's kinda weird to think if you wanted to buy a new car you could fill the inside (cabin) with dollars to buy it. And you know yoh could say well a dollar isnt shit, but even 20 years ago you could get a meal at a restaurant for less than a dollar, maybe 30.. But 15 to 20 years ago 99 cents would get a kids meal... Yeah
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:22:42
same houses.. my mom lives in a weird suburb where there's hundreds of houses built in the seventies but there's only three types of houses, the neighbors have the same house as my mom.. neighbor bought in 94 for 30 thousand, mom bought in 2001 for 110 thousand, and a couple years ago the county accessor or whatever it's called valued them at 300 something thousand.. so yeah 20 something years and its up a 1000%
edit. but this is in the portland metro area, vancouver to be exact, housing is getting retarded here. but still you can't make enough money to live like we used to

No man, its not supply and demand.. Yeah that dictates cost for sure.. But a whopper at burger king going from .37 to 6.00 isnt suplly and demand.. Its inflation.. Food companies aren't upping their prices because people will pay anything for it

yeah, but we used to have precious metals built into our currency, in the last  100yrs precious metals have been removed from the currencies around the world.. almost like it's some global scheme.. the US stopped silver in all coins after 1970 and common coins in 1965, and britain in 1947.. 1974 for germany, funny how germany went off the gold standard in 1914 and they had their currency immediately spun out of control. in 1919 they removed all silver from the coins and here's an image of the rate of inflation [
hitler restored the silver in the coins ..  then basically the whole world went of silver in the second half of the 20th century...  yeah taking value out of our money has been a terrible experiment.  yeah I mean they tried it in the weimar republic, now they've done it again.  we need to get silver and gold back, or something new, and I'm thinking the something new is bitcoin. yeah people are protesting for 15 an hour.. well okay you can get 15 an hour in three years, but in three years you're going to be poorer than when you were making 11 now. we need to start asking for money that holds it's value...

yeah, as an individual, I'm already doing that. I have btc and physical silver holdings...  but I'm saying it doesn't make much sense for society to be whining about higher minimum wage, they're just crying about paper. if society wants to whine they could be whining about being paid in something that holds value... and you can say the individual responsibility thing, but as society we're quickly losing our wealth..  we need to overthrow the king, remove the fiat. yeah like ten years ago you remember liberty dollars? those guys got thrown in prison, for literally no reason.. now we have bitcoin, how will the government throw a decentralized currency in prison? yeah, yeah, personal responsibility, but on a societal level something has eventually got to give.. I mean mass poverty is how wars start.. revolutions..

I had a friend that said that bitcoin will be the mark of the beast, he told me this like six/ seven years ago. so in Revelations it says the mark will be imprinted on the foreheads of people... maybe people will get their wallets imprinted in their heads, so they can't have it stolen... I mean think about it, the big scary thing about bitcoin is having it hacked or stolen. we're on the verge of implants now..  
chapter 13
16 Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free  and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead,
17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name.
18 This  calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the  number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is  666.
yeah maybe.... we implant our wallets in our hands or our foreheads.. I mean think about it, the need for a physical wallet will be gone, we'll vote with bitcoin, make all payments with bitcoin... and our wallets will be implanted in our hands... or our forehead, and maybe the code is like a hexidecimal system or something.. or like a super complex 666 digit code..
