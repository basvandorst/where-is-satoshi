What do folks think of  ??
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:31:14
This is really cool.
@_date: 2014-05-31 06:36:29
I'm impressed with all the capitalization. 
Wish I was closer to try the cookies! (Richmond, VA here)

10 blowstamps
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:12:28
sweet. thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:16:07
I too have a recalescence coin. I'm trying to get my mitts on a casascius now.
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:34:10
In fact, could I commission you to make a combo sign of similar style? I happen to really like LTC too :)
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:25:13
I did! I was just searching for you to say thanks! Honored you stopped by to comment, you created a rad design! 
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:05:19
If that's your reasoning I would go junk silver imo.
A bunch of silver rosies or mercs are easy to trade with and easy to transport. Just my two milibits. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:27:06
ME TOO! lol crazy.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:38:13
yeah. I've never seen that. Or my issue. 
April 3rd? It's still April 2nd, lol.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:27:34
eh. thanks. I guess I've been spoiled, coinbase has always been nearly instant for me. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:52:09
are you in the US? Mt. Gox just deposits into your bank?
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:39:03
yeah, I was hoping to jump on some cheap coin. holding pattern for now I suppose. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:46:58
so you've successfully been able to get fiat out of mtgox?
@_date: 2014-08-21 02:29:34
HAHAHAHAHA omg.
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:19:39
Hey! I too am a photographer in RVA and have been hitting the pavement for work in BTC! Not getting a lot of traction, but I'd love to chat sometime about doing business with a deflationary currency. 
Really pumped to meet another!
I'm at fb.com/commonsparkmedia if you want to catch up sometime! 
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:11:33
Specifically on my pricing page: 
I love this community and would love to introduce my industry to BTC. There's a huge conference in Santa Barbara, CA at the end of this month - I'd love to be the first attendee to say they've been hired for BTC!
**Some extra details:**
Because I'm so anxious to work for BTC, I'm willing to waive travel costs (within reason - here's looking at you, Antarctica, lol.) and come to you. 
A faq: I don't horde your images. You own full print rights and have ownership of your images. You won't get logo'd or watermarked photos. For all my ANCAP (see sidebar) friends, I'm anti-IP and happy to deliver all of my images for you to own and share liberally. I deliver my photos within 2-4 weeks.
Any further questions, please contact us, and I'd be happy to answer them! Of course you can drop a message here, and I'll chime in as well!!
Thanks guys!
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:08:50
interesting analogy. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:00:05
How do I get added to the list? :)
I'm a wedding photographer.
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:47:04
dude. seriously. where can i find one?! lol
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:41:10
Yeah - I just tried to buy .025 just as a test - it went through instantly. Interesting. 
@_date: 2013-10-10 19:43:12
@_date: 2013-10-01 03:08:28
For 4 BTC It better be a pretty epic photobomb. 
I can agree to these terms.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:33:45
Party all over reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:32:12
Man, I would love an explanation of this a little further. Mind PMing me?
Thanks a ton
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:46:45
Just tipped you. Now play me a song. 
just kidding - great idea. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:10:44
This is a gorgeous photo.
@_date: 2013-09-30 17:04:32
Link for the lazy: @_date: 2013-11-07 19:59:37
working on that with my graphic designer. 
But we do accept :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:06:43
If I can help at all: 
Send your folks to blockchain.info to create an easy wallet. Create a special address with blockchain and go to it's URL. You can create a 'donate BTC' button super easy on there.
I can help create some Save the Dates or Invitations creatively incorporating a QR-code if you're interested.
Additional Shameless plug:
I'm a wedding photographer and I would LOVE to book a wedding for BTC.
Massive discount for BTC. PM if interested. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 20:36:49
That's awesome! really really cool! If I have anyone using my services for BTC, I'll definitely pass them your info!
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:27:33
Silver. Lots of Silver. And Fiat. I sell on localbitcoins.com and sell BTC for fiat, and invest the fiat immediately back to BTC. Takes 20-30 minutes of my time, but I'm seeing 10-15% gains each transaction. 
If anyone's looking for a wedding photographer - I'll work for BTC ;)
references and website available via PM - I don't want to spam/hijack the thread!
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:56:47
Yup. Paid in BTC. Felt really good.
@_date: 2013-09-20 15:32:18
wow. Seriously, wow. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:46:37
Get married and hire me as your wedding photographer! I'd love to be the first wedding photographer to work for BTC! :)
@_date: 2013-10-11 14:15:07
What business does your wife receive bitcoin for? I'm finding it terribly hard to have a business in the bitcoin economy these days :/
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:34:53
great advice. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:33:29
spoken like a true comrade. 
I kid. But mostly not. 'fair share?' No thanks.
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:05:30
jailbroke here. blackchain app is awesome.
@_date: 2013-10-11 14:18:59
I haven't integrated coinbase's merchant tools - **yet** - but my business DOES accept bitcoin :)
What are the pros and cons of using coinbase's merchant tools vs setting up your own wallet and running with it?
I'm a professional wedding photographer, shamelessly plugging everywhere that I accept bitcoin.
For 28 BTC I will photograph your wedding **anywhere in the world.**
For 22 BTC I will photograph your wedding **anywhere in the continental U.S.**
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:19:55
Hire a wedding photographer! lol (shameless plug)
