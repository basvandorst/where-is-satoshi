I should clarify that I live in China and I won't be returning any time soon.
I appreciate the help though

Very good points! I'll make a genuine reply after I put my daughter down to bed. Thank you for your insight.

Ah, the good ol' "let's only associate with people with like values, and then be shocked that differing opinions exist!"
Please keep things positive and inclusive for all people, including those who have different ideas from your own.

The market itself is far too complicated to be timed. But this particular time is unique. A significant portion of the user base of have acknowledged the likelihood of this dip well in advance (5000 is a big psychological milestone). Barring geopolitical issues, or any other sudden changes, it's a fair bet that many (inexperienced) people will want to sell at such a large round number (and expect others to sell there too, thereby validating their idea to "get out quick"). People also know the history of BTC and it's massive drops. While I don't expect a drop like that, I would bet others may see 5000 as the peak of this last run.

While I wanted to avoid bringing in altcoins to the debate because I'm by no means trying to argue that any one coin is better (rather, that a theoretical future coin could knock BTC off its pedestal), but IOTA is one cryptocurrency which has 0 fees and nearly instantaneous transaction times. That particular example has its own issues (a poor security team, as it were), but the model just serves as an example of what the future may hold. It may be IOTA, it may be another coin that takes that model and revises it, or it may be something entirely new, but the technology is growing and I personally feel like BTC is a bit slow and expensive to serve many purposes that will soon be in-demand.
@_date: 2017-09-12 10:49:11
But in the theoretical case that a new cryptocurrency is designed without a blockchain or other fundamental technology involved in BTC, wouldn't a fork not be possible in such an instance?
@_date: 2017-09-12 10:45:23
Yes and no. All software can be upgraded, but some core elements must remain the same. (The very presence of a blockchain for example). I'm not privy to future developments, but it seems important to recognize that sometimes there can be a change so radical that tweaking BTC won't enable the seamless integration of new technologies.
Smart contracts are one example that has a more successful and seamless integration option with cryptocurrencies that have been built to support them from the start. BTC tacking them on has been talked about, but without also addressing issues regarding transaction processing speed, it will not stack up. (And those currencies built from the ground up with these technologies in mind seem to fair better when delivering toward that aim).
Simple example: We have some cryptocurrencies that offer full anonymity. Some that offer literally NO transaction fees. Some that offer near instantaneous transaction timings. And still others that are aimed at scalability with no changes to their general functioning. It seems to me that BTC can indeed "add on" some features, but without a radical redesign it won't manage to offer the *full* features found elsewhere.
**EDIT: I should add that this post is a major assumption of mine about *just how far BTC can change*. I could certainly be wrong, and please let me know if I am!**

I absolutely agree about the slow and steady approach. It's undoubtedly necessary with such a colossal project.
My thoughts are more along the lines of crypto evolution. Sure, we have Mama T-Rex (BTC), but with the myriad of competitor currencies, I feel like there is sure to be one that eventually gets things right with limited/no vulnerability (probably learning quite a bit from BTC), that zooms right by because of being the right currency for the right people at the right time.
Let's imagine that Microsoft or Apple or any other tech giant was looking to integrate some sort of universal currency transaction system into their "revolutionary product" (whatever that may be). As I understand it, at its current state they wouldn't choose BTC because the transaction time + fees would be cumbersome to work with.
Though of course I can be wrong! Please let me know if I am.
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:21:45
Fair point. I'm have no plans to time the market on an on-going basis because I truly can't know what the future holds. But in this case, it seems rather predictable. And in my particular case I'm willing to take a small loss (the ~6% loss to buy back in at 5100 when it reaches that mark, with that being a hedge against a larger loss if it drops below ~4600).
(Side note: I already made the transfer around 4800, so I'm really just checking how stupid I am :-P )

By the tone of your post I honestly can't tell if you mean what you write, or if it's satire.
Either way,  account age really doesn't mean anything. Anyone can make a new account at any time...

Sorry you couldn't sense the sarcasm intended in a post about my concern over an internet stranger's opinion of me. I thought it was pretty clear...

USDT is not fiat currency and doesn't need to be reported in the same way as converting out of crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:50:26
Sorry for the short reply, I'm about to watch a movie with my wife. I'll get back to you with a more full answer soon.
1. Great point about the ledger reputation. BTC itself holds the strongest reputation, and would be a hard rock to tumble.
2. Good analogy about kleenex. It's already happening with BTC now. But I also believe that market adoption depends largely on accessibility and convenience. If people start using BTC for transactions, they will certainly notice fees. And likewise if large companies want to adopt the tech for machine to machine tools, the transaction times will become more important (notice the major effect that the length of a webpage load has on consumers).
I'm not arguing that BTC can't fix this, though. I'm honestly not sure if it can or not.

Here's someone who wants to buy in the dip ;-)
(Hint: so do I).
@_date: 2017-09-12 10:36:14
1. My argument isn't for any one particular cryptocurrency, as that would negate my point. My point is: better software can come along that reworks the entire system to the benefit of all consumers. But this means that BTC would be in a precarious position. (Please take a look at alternatives, including the second runner-up ETH).
2. Good point for the short term value of BTC, but this stands true for any cryptocurrency. And citing the previous market trends of any particular business or currency is no indicator for the future. It's certainly true that crypto can be a safe-haven against inflation, but that's not exclusive to BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:48:33
I like it!
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:30:06
That's a fair point that I hadn't given enough thought to. I was expecting a roughly ~6% loss if the price continued to rise to 5100 (where I intend to buy back in), but it may be closer to ~12%. Ah well, live and learn! Now I just need to hope for a dip to around 4300. :-p
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:38:22
TIL. Thank you for this. HODL all the way!
I did some more research and found [this](


@_date: 2017-09-03 04:22:46
Fair point. I've heard some potential issues with that.
Seeing as I'm working with relatively small money, it's not going to break my heart if it doesn't work to my favor. But thank you for your advice!

Title of the post: "Change my mind."
Who else should I speak with? Should I ask this question on an alternative cryptocurrency sub so that I can be in my own echo chamber of good feelings and agreement? Encouraging debate is healthy for all people to grow from what they learn.
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:40:11
I understand your point about other cryptocurrencies, but it seems to me that you're painting with a broad brush. Sure most are flawed, but some are being built by great minds who are taking these things into account (but this is absolutely not the majority of cases).
I would counter your other points, though, by pointing out the transaction time and transaction fees. If I wanted to build a piece of tech to utilize a cryptocurrency as a means of transaction, be it person to person or machine to machine, it would be too expensive to bid for next-block processing, and too slow to wait out the low fees. Especially considering there are other cryptos in development which are aiming at 0 fees and near instantaneous transactions.

Agreed that this will be a challenge to overcome. Really it's bittersweet that more investors are getting involved. On the one hand, it's made BTC more enticing, (and fattened our wallets), but it's also brought potentially turbulent times.
Although I would counter with my point from above: I don't foresee the value of BTC dropping significantly in a major crash, simply because the fluctuations to date would have most investors believe that it may bounce right back up (and thereby becoming a self fulfilling prophecy with people taking the "buy in the dip" mentality). I suppose that the decline of BTC would happen with that number of "dip investors" slowly decreasing (probably by influence of negative public sentiment).
