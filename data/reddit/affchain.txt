Sounds great.  Why am i just now hearing of this? Alpha releases are always scary to me when it comes to my coins. I will be getting in on this early though.

Is the BTC price looking the same around the whole world? I know a few months ago on Indonesian markets, it was trading much higher than here in America.

There should be some kind of tool invented that would help a regular person or a noob visualize the steady climb of Bitcoin. Or, maybe a graphic of somekind. Oh! Even better!!! A website that is specifically designed to kind of keep track of the ups and downs and has historical records of such information. 
If these inventions of mine are created, it will make these situations less stressful for the panic sellers. 
All my ideas and inventions are open source so have at it.

Instead of making larger denominations. The genius minds in charge decided to make giant sheets of the 100 dollar bill so they didn't have to hire a designer that could tackle the impossible feat of fitting Trumps toupe on the standard bill size.

I get this now..... I rarely play dice, but when I do, I can't YOLO because I'm full of FUD so I choose to HODL instead....... Nailed it!
