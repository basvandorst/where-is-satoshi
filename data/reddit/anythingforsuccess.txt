I don't understand that. Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2016-08-13 10:11:52
He is correct. Bitcoin is owned by Rotschilds and bankers now. Check the dev team background.
@_date: 2016-08-28 14:29:25
What is ifttt?
@_date: 2015-06-28 13:50:25
Because it's just not that good.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:53:06
What ever makes you sleep at night, OP. There is no "doing it right". Stop making price drops seem like a good thing. Buying in a downtrend is moronic and against sound financial principles. Wait for a reversal. Inb4 "fearful when greedy" bs advice.
@_date: 2014-06-07 19:45:17
How can Bitcoin survive long term if this ALWAYS is going to be a problem?
@_date: 2014-01-11 09:22:02
He has a point. It is a realistic possibility.
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:43:18
@_date: 2014-09-27 08:16:44
Except that image is false. Fiat has been relatively stable, Bitcoin is worth 2x less than it was last year. LOL @ these delusions!
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:31:55
Bitcoin is like the gateway drug to stock market.
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:49:44
Mtgox is a scam exchange and I think it is quite obvious. Why would exchange be an issue for BTC? It makes no sense. Think about it. If Citibank would go bust...would dollar drop? Would it?
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:14:12
And who cares? A few people use Silk Road anyway, besides this was not original Silk Road, but another copycat. And the owner just stole the Bitcoins. Why the FUD?
@_date: 2017-02-24 11:41:46
Does Cloudflare bug affect only users who were USING the service at THAT PARTICULAR TIME INTERVAL?
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:08:45
MTGox =/= Bitcoin
Citibank =/= USD
In history of Bitcoin there have been tons of scam sites that steal your BTC and scam you. Mtgox is one of those sites. Just like in internet there are tons of sites that steal your credit card data.
@_date: 2017-02-09 12:28:36
If I'm running old version of Bitcoin Core just to store my BTC, do I even need to care about this? How can this affect me?
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:43:58
So if you are just holding long term you can just ignore all of this BS and keep holding?
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:01:12
Or in a year...or in two years. Why do you care if you hold?
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:48:25
Why are tough times? Imaginary internet money is costing in thousands? How is this tough?
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:17:52
Wrong! Because those services are so popular, the companies also invest heavily in security. Less popular services have companies that are not so rich so they can't invest in user security. You really think Gmail is unsafe? It provides you with 2FA, log of activities, warns if it is a suspicious activity and asks for additional information. It is fine.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:34:43
Can someone ELI5 why this code is bad?
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:44:55
That is what I'm thinking. I just don't understand the panic. Was a critical bug found? No? Then chill out. Wow, Bitcoin dropped from 1200$ to 900$. Awful. You do realise that one digital bean costs about a grand? You don't think thats insanely high already? Haha
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:04:24
Probably because a solution is needed for the whole blocksize issue and they implemented a bug that fixes the nodes going offline thing.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:46:33
How are they not centralised again?
Don't call FUD, but learn to present your argument correctly.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:22:37
Sorry what? Wasn't SegWit supposed to lower the fees?
WTH? What is the point if the fees aren't low and I can't use Buttcoin to buy groceries? Care to explain?
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:07:32
So I get my free coins?
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:52:06
How do you hedge?
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:24:04
I understand that if you want freedom you pay 10$ for on-chain transaction fee. If you don't care about freedom you use the centralised side-chain hub and pay next to nothing.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:25:40


I think he is not neutral, but biased.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:15:15
But Lightning Network is still years ahead, is it not?
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:26:40
Explain how exactly please. I'm not sure I get it.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:15:58


So they are most likely keeping lots of coins hoarded to artificially reduce supply and inflate the price. I mean, why would they not do it? The same thing is done with diamonds.


Why is that so?
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:07:48
It doesn't matter until you realise your profits.
Also, half way is a long way.
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:19:12
boom &amp; bust cycles
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:45:29
Anger not logic. Post disregarded.
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:53:13
So, why did price of BTC not fall down?
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:05:20
But can it be done it time?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:01:52
So...no BCC fork will happen?
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:07:05


Why not? Is it not kind of happening right now?
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:55:28
What good are private keys when there are no computers to upkeep the network and you can't send your coins, because no blocks are being mined? Explain it to me, please.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:47:30


Arguments not ad hominems pls
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:28:13
Is there some link where we can see all the cryptos which currently have SegWit? I want to know with which cryptos Bitcoin will be able to pair in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:56:35
Many of those coins must have been lost. There is less actually in circulation.
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:07:26
Can it be changed urgently? If, let us say, next week this thing becomes a real threat?
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:34:41
I'm talking about sidechain hubs. I know that LN is not a sidechain.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:54:43


Why not? If people got "free money" in BCH all of the sudden it is not guaranteed at all they will "dump" it for BTC. They might as well "dump" it for fiat to buy their lambos and what not.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:26:15
Too late now. They are exit scamming.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:05:56
Can confirm, I mailed that guy.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:51:38
This, I've been telling this for a long while. The normies are in, this will all collapse.
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:04:30
I mean on side chain 51% attack is easy.
@_date: 2017-08-06 09:58:04


Because it means nobody will use it for actual purchases and instead use inflationary fiat. Bad money drives out good money, Greshams law.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:11:42
Can someone comment on this?
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:40:57


Wow, that is very unfortunate.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:28:20
You will only get those small fees for off-chain transactions. On-chain you will be paying big boy fees 10$ and so.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:03:43
I have never shorted anything in my life lol.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:25:16


What do you mean nothing to do with Bitcoin? Does it not maintain the original Bitcoin white paper idea and all taht stuff? Basically it is less changed from the original. Like Bitcoin classic or something.
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:07:55
Because now people might want to use BCH instead and sell BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:50:32
Sorry, but you had a great chance to buy the dip a month or two ago.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:28:39
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:50:38
I will not be spending them until I can sell them to a greater fool.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:46:49
Who is Roger Ver?
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:06:08
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:35:28
Why isn't everyone selling right now for those prices then?
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:06:40
What are you doing now? Going long or selling? What indicators do you use?
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:18:49
Ok, but why is there no chain split?
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:39:18
What do you mean bitlicense? How does it affect volume?
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:57:11
So he gambled and won.
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:07:21
Doesn't make sense. You can't just create 7 billion market value out of thin air. Why do cryptotards complain about FED emitting new money when a simple chain split adds 7 billion to market?
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:47:59


Ok...so when are we having LN on Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:02:44
Right,  but this can still hurt bitcoin dramatically and with such risk always being there...why would you trust the crypto?
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:36:56


Not if people sell BCH for fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:26:10
Yeah, but that volume is fake. Anyone can easily create such volume by trading among themselves, which was done with Bcash when it just released within exchanges. Also, remember willybot.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:36:44
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:23:12
Yeah, but 2nd-layer is centralised. Anyone can just steal your shit on it.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:26:11


What else can you speak in the crypto world than technicals? Technicals is all that matter. This is code, code is law...and all that jazz
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:27:14


I can get paid for this? Where?
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:29:03
Wouldn't zero fees increase the volume? I don't really get it? ELI5 anyone?
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:26:08
Because previously miners couldn't switch between chains, but now they do have this option. This changes the battlefield.
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:04:59
Blockchain death spiral. BСС kills BTC due to uneven difficulty adjustments.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:29:48


Oh, how naive...
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:13:03
You can't just "create" money out of thin air. After the split 7 billion USD was added to total crypto market cap. How the hell?
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:12:21
Nah, it was the Chinese gift to me so I will keep it.
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:10:09
But if Bitcoin crashes, everything will crash.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:03:14
It is.
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:03:07
Yes, but it is called a fork and people refer to it as Bitcoin splitting, so natural understanding it that "Bitcoin splits in half".
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:19:52
Haven't other coins added SegWit?
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:42:32
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:07:46


Umm...no. There can be no economic growth if everyone hoards money instead of using it to buy goods and services.
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:06:59
So how do I explain it ELI5 style?
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:11:32
Why is it on coinmarketcap.com then?
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:36:39
Is there any info when exchanges will enable BCH deposits?
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:06:01
Wait...am I not getting my free Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:19:01
She doesn't know much about that.
@_date: 2016-11-03 11:46:36
Yeah, and normal guys sometimes win lottery as well.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:03:16
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:19:23
Latecomer and his wishful thinking...
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:05:08
What if...it actually is a scam?
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:26:05
No we did not fork, it says no chain split detected on btcsplitmonitor.info
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:04:47
Off-chains can be attacked by 51% attack, so are unsafe.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:49:26
Or you can just buy stuff with your BTC directly.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:57:35
Yes, sometimes gamblers get lucky.
@_date: 2016-12-27 08:41:37
This was not a smart move, OP. Especially not during this time.
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:27:01
Actual answer: No, this is not a good time to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:52:23
What does it mean for me, as an average Bitcoin user? I keep my bitcoins in the original client wallet. What do I have to do now?
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:44:11


Ok, so better stay away from them.


We thought mtgox had reputation as well back in the day. See how that turned out.


So is the safest way doing it like I do? Having a core client on a separate computer that isn't used?


You can't buy that stuff with Bitcoin.


No, but there are credit cards.
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:11:15


But it obviously is.


So what prevents this attack exactly?
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:42:03
Is it safe? Can't they steal it technically?
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:05:29
This is a forum for asking questions, deal with it.
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:40:51
Yeah, but normal people don't.
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:08:58
Explain what do I have to do if my wallet is in Bitcoin QT client with my Bitcoins, but I don't use it? I just keep them there. Should I do anything at all?
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:01:12
Yeah, but won't they just steal my wallet or something eventually?
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:02:49
So this means that Bitcoin is basically broken, correct? We cannot call it "decentralized" anymore, since it is clearly centralized. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:59:01
It came close several times.


You can't secure a currency with "game theory". This is a non-argument. There is an obvious vulnerability that there is no solution to.
@_date: 2017-04-11 22:25:08
Right...how does this affect me if I'm a Bitcoin Core client user?
@_date: 2017-04-03 10:05:34
The guy said the casino was EU based.
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:03:58
Wrong. How is it not a crime? Do you know that Bitcoin theft is still theft?
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:23:13
"hacked" - when exchange owners decide it is time for a well earned megayacht.
@_date: 2015-07-21 12:32:50
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:03:31
What do you mean they can do "nothing"?
The website is run at a host. They should get IP and get the logs of whoever paid for it.
Then you get the criminals. It is that easy.
@_date: 2017-04-12 08:48:48
This will officially take place on August the 1st? I can make transactions right now and during the following months?
@_date: 2016-09-12 11:45:05


Why are you so sure? Bitcoin has lots of problems, there are plenty of better cryptos out there that are faster than Bitcoin and have many improvements? Why would you assume price of Bitcoin will go up?
@_date: 2016-09-12 11:53:45


Index funds.
@_date: 2017-09-12 10:30:24
How do I apply to be a Roger Ver's paid shill? I messaged him but he did not reply.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:48:40
There seem to be very few unconfirmed transactions now. Why is that?
SegWit implementation?
Bitcoin used less?
Spam attacks stopped?
I remember time when they were above 100k
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:12:00
What is the difference between regular Bitcoin ETF and Bitcoin Futures ETF?
@_date: 2016-09-12 11:53:24
The difference is Warren Buffett is smart. Nobody here is as smart as him, so should just buy indices like the normal people we are. Being overconfident in your knowledge of magic internet beans is asking for trouble.
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:28:08
Why would you pull money out? Banning ICOs are a good thing, less scams.
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:31:14
They just printed 25M$ fake Tethers that are not backed by any real $ to just pump up the price. This will end in tears.
Also, why doesn't BItfinex and Tethers do an audit then and let us know the truth eh? Convenient how they have been dodging audits for years now.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:52:44
Buttcoin is bs with high fees and slow confirmation times.
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:32:50
You should be worried, because before BItfinex started pumping Bitcoin price with fake Tether scam in March (shortly after they lost their banking license). May I remind you that Bitcoin price was around 1000$ or lower at that time, Bitfinex fake Tether scam pump with Spoofy bot and wash trading pumped it all the way to 5000$. Still not worried?
You fine with 80% of your crypto value disappearing overnight?
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:15:40
Get a new one.
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:54:37
Where can you follow these statistics?
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:52:52
Great news, price has just fallen.
@_date: 2016-10-28 07:27:49
Magic beans don't count as money - SHOCKER!
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:37:32


@_date: 2017-05-22 09:03:22
Who cares? It is the network which decides in the end. If there is no network support, there is no change of client / fork / whatever. Or am I wrong here?
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:15:26
Stop shilling, segwit is not needed for this. All can be resolved with block size increase.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:23:24
Online service scams your coins. What else is new.
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:30:26
What do you suggest except Polo for buying and selling shitcoins then?
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:24:23
I'm not using a command line, I'm a normie, who clicks the Bitcoin Core icon and launches the client. I don't know what that is of what you speak about. I would prefer to use the program I was using until now.
@_date: 2016-10-28 16:48:53
Sue them silly
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:48:09
That is not very convincing. People like me want coins to go fast. People don't really care about emotions or politics in crypto, they just want the coin to work.
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:30:12
Ripple is a scam. It is meant for B2B transactions, it is not meant for holding wealth and for individuals. It is centralised and being manipulated by the holding company. It cannot be withdrawn to a wallet, but only speculated in exchanges. I don't understand how can people buy it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:41:42
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:49:40
Ok, please give a better solution then.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:03:51
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:03:10
Willing to put your money where your mouth is?
You shorting?
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:06:55


Such as NEM, ETH, DASH, PIVX.
So that is why you diversify!
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:39:30
The gox bubble was created by fake volume by willibot. Now, due to how many exchanges there are, it is not that easy anymore.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:56:31
Well, of course it is. It is a bubble just as I said a few days ago:
Look at this chart for reference:
We are at "fear" stage now. It will fall about 4x more, then people will oversell, then it will return to mean and continue steadily growing until the next bubble within 3 or 5 years.
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:39:22
Ok, can you give me link to tutorial or just tell me how to use it properly? I don't want to pay all of my Bitcoins in fee in an accident or anything like that.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:26:04
It is a bubble popping, because Dan Balzerian announced he bought Bitcoin on his Instagram to millions of normies. Then he sold as they bought in (he was aware of Bitcoin long before this). Now he has another good way to launder his dads millions. Genius!
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:31:42
Not happening. Too many norms bought in for it to fall that low. Bitcoin is much better known, higher volumes and higher interest. It just can't fall that low anymore.
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:03:15


Stop regurgitating this libertarian fantasy. It will never happen.
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:41:53
Because Jihan will put his own gold in place, effectively making him king of gold.
His Bitmain coin will beat Bitcoin and people will switch to it, you will see.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:55:22
I think that those might be exchange owners, they have the money, they see everyones orders, they can literally manipulate the prices. These guys will always win in the end, you can't outplay them.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:00:11
Well, the SegWit changes of August 2017 will fix this, right?
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:12:29


No, that is herd thinking, judging by the book and ad hominems.
Attack the arguments or GTFO.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:07:39
Cool, are you shorting on leverage then?
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:21:01
Why aren't there any yet? Any idea?
@_date: 2017-05-01 06:05:55
Heh, why do you think I created this thread? The "friend" should know what his "friend" is all about.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:59:55
This, it has to go down like 50% more to be in the "crash territory".
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:39:37


So what is your exit point?
Time scale or price of Bitcoin?
When are you exiting then "long term" holder?
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:14:32
It's his secret army...embarking on the final mission, the secret weapon...grave times are upon us...may Satoshi have mercy
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:07:10
Short and buy low.
Double the profits.
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:14:19
So Bitcoin is kill?
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:29:10
Bitcoin is slower than ever.
Dumb bubble.
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:48:43
Why are you holding most of your funds with them? That is like asking to be robbed. I mean it is common knowledge in world of crypto that most exchanges steal from their clients. Why would they not do it? They can just say it is a hack or a DDOS attack, whatever tickles their fancy. It is very convenient for them to get "hacked".

@_date: 2017-05-20 09:47:35


It is not the early days. You are late adopters.
Reason being: normies have heard about Bitcoin from missing hard drive stories and all that jazz. Normies just chose not to use Bitcoin, because frankly speaking it is unusable (can't even send the transactions properly).
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:53:29
Chinese will backpedal. They did this with Litecoin, they will cause crash, short it and buy low. Mark my words!!!
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:16:02
I did, predicted and shorted and I have posts to prove it.
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:07:27
Stop listening to memes and start using your brain. Only a fool does not short an obvious fall and does not buy an obvious DIP.

@_date: 2017-05-21 17:10:43
I don't know how to do that. I'm a dumb normie who uses user friendly UIs like Bitcoin Core.
I don't understand anything what you said. I just know that my coins have stuck in a limbo and I'm not sure how to regain control.
Funnily enough I have had NO ISSUES using Ledger Nano S. There I just indicated a high fee, I see how many in USD I will spend and confirm it. But on Bitcoin Core v0.14.0 it is glitching form e.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:24:57
Yeah, and the market can always fork later if they wish to do so.
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:32:00
If everyone thinks it will "go down nicely", then there will be havoc and blood.
If everyone expects havoc and blood, then it will go down "nicely".
Right now people think it will be ok.
This is calm before the storm, mark my words. The pain of loss will be insufferable. Chinese mining gangs will destroy Bitcoin for quick profits and leave it rotting and shattered in the streets as they move their targets to the next coin.

Right, but will you be able to get whatever you have in Bitcoin at the time in the BCC coin? I understand that for every Bitcoin I own (private key) I will get one BCC? How will that work? So there will be a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:02:57
Does not mean anything. Jihan Wu will play a trick on you!
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:33:42
So you got lucky. Congratulations. And you think "keeping up" with that strategy will work for every other case now? I'd like to see your future predictions of tops and bottoms then. When will you be buying back in?
What analytics did you use to determine that 190$ is a good exit point? Preferably in detail.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:35:32
So on July 21st we would theoretically go well over 80%?
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:52:56
You obviously have never dealt with the Chinese. They always choose short term profits over long term cooperation. It is in their blood.
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:33:25
Yeah, but eventually the market will dictate what happens. If it forks, let it fork and each will continue on their own.
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:57:48
So that is a bullshit agreement pretty much. Why did they not make it a binding legal agreement?
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:40:06

So you don't manipulate the Bitcoin price? :(
One thing I am always curious about - would whales actually hold millions or even hundreds of thousands of crypto at the exchanges?
It is quite normal for exchanges to freeze funds or find a reason to keep client's money + added risk of "hacks".
If I had 10mil$ worth of BTC, I would be too chicken to hold it one exchanges, even when spread out.
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:33:21
Typical scam move by scam exchange. Oh wait, all Bitcoin exchanges are scams. Sorry, this time you were the unlucky ones. It is not like you can sue lol

@_date: 2017-07-18 17:16:35
In that case they won't lock in SegWit right away just pretend they are not supporting it to cause the fall in price and short it and then lock in it finally to buy low.
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:29:59
So it will be decentrilized, encrypted shared data storage I assume (something like SIACoin).
Now if only OpenBazaar would accept other cryptos and enforce more strict anonimity, druggies might actually start using the client you know!

Please stop spouting this meme. In no way it is peanuts. The total publicly traded stock cap is 70 trillion. I don't understand how you manage to hamster yourself into believing that 1 million per Bitcoin is somewhat realistic. It just isn't.
Stop coping this hard. You are not innovators, hell, you aren't even early adopters, you are early majority at best. This has reached its peak and will burst soon. Everyone is aware of Bitcoin now. Time to sell.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:09:01
So...SegWit will most likely happen, but 2x part won't happen, because it would force a hardfork and many won't upgrade? Is that correct?
So when does SegWit activate?
Does it make sense to buy Bitcoin now?

Literally druggies on Dark Net Markets. That is who. I even know these people. They literally buy Bitcoin to order some steroid or something off DN.


You know I am right, but force to be anal about it. Delusion is palpable, but hey, if you like holding the bag so much, be my guest. Here is a hint - there are pretty much no legitimate users of Bitcoin, because it simply does not work for "legitimate use". The proof is in the confirmation times and fees, you can look them up in the statistics oh and the fluctuation of price. It would take a moron to try to convert fiat to Bitcoin for sole reason of making a legal purchase and exposing himself to 1) crypto fluctuation 2) high fees 3) slow transaction 4) chance of hack. Yeah, there is your proof. Go look at numbers un unconfirmed transactions, it is all there and don't answer "no" in my place:
Go tell me these are moms and dads buying groceries and using Bitcoin "as a currency" for anything else than speculation and crime. Yeah right.


Oh, alright, miners, who speculate on the price of Bitcoins to be at the level where they sustain their operation and profit for it. So again - **SPECULATION**.


This is very easy and only a blind person will not see this. With CASH we talk about paper notes and coins, right? So go to literally any shop and see how many people are paying with coins and paper for purchases. Go to walmart, go to anywhere, ask how many vendors accept cash. HINT: 99.9999% of them do (some banks don't).
Yeah, now go and find those criminals who use cash. Sure, you can find them if you look hard enough (search online). Yeah, calculate the percentages of criminals and people who use cash for buying ice cream. Exactly.

According to this comparison cryptocurrency market cap should be much, much lower.
I mean if Google/Apple are something around 6-7 hundred BILLION, then crypto is 1/7th of that.
Is there a crypto 1 crypto user for every 7 Google / Apple users?
Crypto is blown WAAAY out of proportion.

No, this means that soon your taxi driver will be giving you crypto buying tips.

Right, but people don't buy Bitcoin to use it to buy legal things.
People buy Bitcoin to use it t buy **ILLEGAL** things.
Or people have **SPECULATED** with Bitcoin, earned capital gains and now it is CONVENIENT for them to cash out by using it for purchases.
A few, minor evangelists force themselves to use Bitcoin for normal purchases to fool themselves into thinking it is actually a good solution for everyday purchases. Very few such people (naturally their concentration on a Bitcoin subreddit will be higher than among normie population).


Total non-argument and I will explain why. The total % of fiat used for crime is DRAMATICALLY smaller than the total % of crypto used for crime. So this is a non-comparison.


Hey, I never said it is a good or bad thing. Only 12 year olds believe in universal "good" or "bad". It depends on the party. "Good" for individual escaping fiat controls, "bad" for the individuals running the country.


Simply wrong by definition and rendered as emotional / anarchist speak.


More coping from a bagholder. Go google "Bubble chart" and see how perfectly it fits. It is almost too perfect. And all the current ICOs are shitty .coms of 1999. Public mania is already there. Not all things have to come to fruition for it to be rendered a bubble.


Backing up with facts, mate. You can't weasel your way out of admitting that crypto is used for **CRIME** and **SPECULATION** 99.99% and maybe 0.01% of fanatics legitimately think buying alpaca socks with Bitcoin is great and convenient (just lol).


That is because you did not understand my points. Merchant adoption will allow holders to "cash out" easier. Merchants won't hold crypto, they will convert it to fiat that is actually stable and they can use to buy stuff with it. So whale holders will buy their ferraris and apartments and that money will be taken out of crypto and put back in fiat.

@_date: 2017-06-19 23:32:23
Those arguments that you posted are not really objective. You are conveniently avoiding the publicly known facts that Ether was available for anyone to purchase during ICO. 
Please elaborate on "promises that could never, have not and can't ever be fulfilled".
Bailing out is a nice catch phrase, but in reality nothing was bailed out, the public consensus determined that they want a hard fork and it happened. Literally how blockchain works in its roots and what might happen to Bitcoin soon. It is not "bailing out". Miners still have to agree.


Needs detailed explanations not just labelling.


Like literally every other crypto. There is Raiden network and sidechains for scaling in plans.


Individuals have lured plenty of newbs into buttcoins, pump and dumps of any cryptos. Literally a non argument.


I agree on the fact that ICOs caused a pyramid pretty much.
But you think TSLA is not a pyramid?
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:36:43

Sorry, i don't understand what China coin are you talking about.
