While you are right that surveillance and control is not the same word - good job btw for pointing that out - you forget that they work hand in hand.

A good read: [The ultimate goal of the NSA is total population control]( to make it clear for you how connected surveillance and control really is.

Cute that you use the word observation for surveillance.

the cached version or the live version? because I still get "Oops. That page doesn’t exist.". maybe the country i'm currently in is not supported. I'll try a vpn later.
Edit: Even with a vpn connection in different locations I can't access the page.

OTR and OpenPGP sounds good. Downsides: Android only and paid app. I'll discuss it with some people over the next view days. You are also invited to participate in the discussion here: @_date: 2015-03-29 10:45:05
Thanks, that is a good idea. I'll add cloud storages next week.

How did I deserve that generous tip? :) Cheers, mate!
My browser and system language is german and I'm in asia. Maybe they're blocking germans in asia?

You are welcome. Why not go with the flow? They don't respect your privacy, you start encrypting while fight politcal.

Hm, do you know a good / encrypted password manager? I use LastPass but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to recommend other people to save their password in the cloud for privacy reasons.

We're not alone: 
But the "flag trick" didn't work for me.

I agree. I've wrote this under the vpn provider comparison table:
"**Note:** Using a VPN provider will not make you anonymous. But it will give you a better privacy. A VPN is not a tool for illegal activities. Don't rely on a "no log" policy."

I like the idea of what Mullvad did. But I've just checked all the providers on the list again and none of them requires personal information to make an account. They all just ask for: Username, Email, Password. 
Therefor I'd advice everyone to get a privacy email address first:
