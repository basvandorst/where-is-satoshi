Dude - trust me when I say that I am in disbelief. I was on a good track financially before it all played out, but then the stars aligned. I woke up one morning and my inner voice slapped me across the face and said "DON'T BE GREEDY". I had to take some gains (and holy shit, the timing). Then BCH hit Coinbase and I flushed that shit down the toilet as fast as I could (I thought it would crash and die, honestly). There's something very weird about making a couple hundred thousand dollars in 2 minutes and then walking over to your friend's house to help him cut down a tree, like "la la la..." (which is how selling BCH played out for me).

I talk about some of this here: 
Before I moved any money at all I went to my bank, in person, and sat down with a manager. I told them I had sold bitcoin (they were aware of bitcoin and knew it was going apeshit) in the sum of ~1.4M and wanted to move it into the bank, to be moved later into a brokerage account. I asked about ANY bullshit. I was told that as long as it was acquired by legal means, the amount was not a problem. 
Over the next several days I would log into CoinBase and transfer 250k at a time into my account. I was never stopped, questioned, looked at sideways, etc. at all. Nothing. Then I moved the money (minus my estimated tax bill) into the investment account (out of the bank) in one big chunk and once again had no problems.

Dude - I've been able to completely goof off for the last 15 months. No work. No grind. Do you understand how valuable that is?

Forget about it for 5 years unless you are in a bind. Then come back and be amazed at how smart/stupid you were.

You hear this people? This post speaks serious truth. I'm especially on board with less consumption - there is so much extraneous crap in most people's lives. I'm not a robot, and I'm not a minimalist fetishist like some weirdos I saw on YouTube recently, but I don't want or need much in the way of physical things and so I get rid of stuff constantly. In fact, there are 4 grocery bags of Godwill stuff in my livingroom right now - my gf cleaned out a closet and we are letting stuff go.

My goal was to retire in my mid 40's, but with considerably less money than I actually made with the BTC gains. So I was on a path, but this just pushed it into rocket mode.

Great question - for the most part, yes. I love autonomy without the pressure to monetize my time. I can read a book whenever I want. I have hobbies I can pursue and if I am inspired, I can just do that thing (make art, play piano, whatever) as long as I need/want to.
My relationship with time has changed radically. I forgot what month it was yesterday (April? May?). It's quite liberating.
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:03:12
Yeah, I didn't make 100% of my money in bitcoin sales and I have worked a high paying job for enough years that I'm right there. Bitcoin just pushed me over the edge.

I sold a couple times on Coinbase. Turning bitcoin into half a million dollars in a 15 second period as the market met my price was surreal. I had to ask Coinbase for an increase in my daily totals in order to move the money easily. I talked to my bank ahead of time (BoA) and they told me it wouldn't be a problem. 
I had 0 problems moving the money into my bank over several days. Nobody batted an eye. Later I moved the money into my brokerage account and that was a simple transfer as well. 
When I see people on here talking about how a bank would never let you do X and how moving the money is impossible or that the government won't let you or whatever other bullshit I have to wonder if they had that experience or if they are just full of shit and think they know something. I had no problems at all. Seriously.

I don't think it's funny unless they think the money is going to become a million dollars by the end of the year. The moonshot people this late to the game don't make sense to me. I think it's a good investment still, for sure, but it's not exactly "cheap" anymore. That said, 10x is totally possible in my opinion.

I can't deny luck in all this. I made the bet, I followed the tech, I helped others with questions over the years... and it worked out. So there was some skill, lots of risk, and yes, luck for sure.

I wasn't super wealthy before (grew up with no money tbh) but I had done well for myself in the meantime, just by being scrappy. I did well in school, got a teaching fellowship to graduate school, went into tech at the right moment for my skills and so I had the money to invest in bitcoin to begin with. It was my "what if". When it blew up I was amazed. When I cashed some out and set up my future portfolio and further diversified, I was overwhelmed. How the fuck did I do this?
I wrote about my feelings a bit in this post: 
I didn't really change my lifestyle - I'm a chill person who likes simple things. No Lambo, no luxury bullshit, just security. And I get as much sleep as I damn well want, whenever I want. It has made my life good in that I'm not so worried about my parents having very little retirement saved. I gave my family a little bit of money, and that felt good. I'm a better friend since I have social energy not eaten up in the workplace. I've been able to think about fun and weird next steps I might take - like living abroad for a few months at a time. So it really did change me, but not radically.

Specific answer to your question: no fucking clue and I'd just be throwing a dart if I said anything. I'm a numbers geek and a scientist - I'm uncomfortable stating opinions without real backing.
However, I think BTC has a lot of room for growing. The general curiosity mixed with how little people actually understand it (and how few really seem to care) is a combo that suggests potential. The copycat coins, hedge funds, regulatory flailing, country banning, etc. shows it has hit a nerve. Add to that the general destabilization period we seem to be in politically with Europe, Middle East, USA... lots of narratives feed into bitcoin gaining comparative utility. 
I could easily imagine a series of bull/bear hypercycles and fuck me if I have a clue where they peak and valley.

@_date: 2019-05-18 06:56:59
No, but I am aware of that strategy. There were some serious family issues happening in the end of the year (great time to be unemployed to be able to help) that kept me from even paying attention to all that shit when I could have taken advantage of it.

Thanks for the kind words. I'm not as sold on gold and silver as insurance - The way I see it, my insurance is my mind - I can go back to work at any time and my skillset is such that it won't atrophy like some technology skills. I know working vs gold is a bit different, but I see them as both ways to deal with "if shit gets weird".

Part of the "luck" is setting yourself up to be able to take advantage of opportunities when they pop up. If I was dead broke, all the learning about BTC would not have made me jack-shit. I had money to spare, and my ticket got picked for the bingo, and I cashed that ticket (somewhat).

I never bought any back. I only sold - but I didn't sell my full stack, just what I needed to do this early retirement deal.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:29:45
Thanks. The story is real. You can also see a bit more about my bigger picture by looking at my (brief) post history. Of course, that might be made up too... right? Or maybe I actually did it, and said fuck it, and quit my job, and paid my taxes, and moved the money into my bank account and then into the stock market, and now live off of dividends and go on bike rides instead of grinding.

I bought a basket of index funds that include bonds, total US market, international market, growth companies, and real estate. Together they pay around 2.5% in dividends so added to other investments I made I can clear 50k without touching the funds. If the market goes to shit, I still have plenty of "50k" units in my account I can liquidate over the next several years. I can also go back to work if I want to . Lastly, I can sell the BTC I still hold (if I must).
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:04:06
It goes up to 20% at some point.
