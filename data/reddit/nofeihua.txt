The older "gentleman" maybe said it best:
"A type of virtual money that flies across the world with smart guys sitting in between manipulating the price"
The smart guys would be the exchanges and centralized miners.
You don't need to be a cryptographer-programer-mathematician to figure out that the masses will always be used to feed the ones in control over the information and money/Bitcoin creation.

When paying with cash buyer can inspect the product before handing over the slave money, so dispute is not needed.
Question remains, why would buyer choose Bitcoin over Paypal?
@_date: 2014-01-04 21:15:26
What you have seen are the high value going up by 1000's of % and all 
the happy stories off kids getting rich over night.
But remember, even tough Bitcoins are made from thin air by mining, the cash you eventually want to trade if for are from someone else pocket.
Im not sure what your definition of stupid is, but falling for the temptation based on others greed wanting to hype the value higher instead of using the Bitcoin and making it more mainstream adoption is worse.

Great to see another exchange based in Hong Kong.
The first question that arises when browsing the site is why so little info about the people or company behind it?
There are alot of pretty words in the About but nothing concrete, no company name, no company address, no phone number, not a single name of a person.
I think many new users are very concerned about the safety of their funds being held by anonymous individuals.
I am willing to reveal my identity to your company only if you do the same, wish you all the best.

Just found another useful way for the Z watch.
I just captured the image from a desktop wallet and displayed on the smart watch as image.
No need to pull out the wallet on phone and risk being robbed on your private keys :)

Sounds like you never had the chance to fully test the use cases on a smart watch, other then "drooling over Dick Tracy's incredible tech".
I too was sceptical before i had the chance to test this smart watch and i find new use cases all the time, that actually are sometimes smarter then using my phone all the time like checking the time :)
We all know how much ppl where sceptical to tablets, ebooks or any new technology that we are not used to, specially Bitcoin ;)
I always start to tell people: "Be open minded" before trying to explain why they need learn and use Bitcoin.
Maybe i just posted in wrong subreddit and should have posted under but i hoped that i could contribute an making Bitcoin alittle bit more useful, buy offering a new kind of product for new kind of currency, something everyone is saying has to happen before Bitcoin get mass adoption.
But honestly, reading most of the comments, i see most Bitcoin users are just instrested in hyping the value in order to enrich them self, instead of doing something constructive to benifit the whole Bitcoin community and eco system.

After reading all the scary stories about lost funds from  blockchain.info users, i decided to pull my few coins out. 
Only to discover that my 3.2 BTC balance was not enough to cover a 3.0BTC withdraw.
As i am not able to contact blockchain.info support, im posting here to get some clues to what the reason may be.
I also noticed that BTC balance on top right of the page has swapped side with the USD balance, not sure if this may be related.

Well too bad you didnt spend few min reading that this smart watch is exactly what a smart watch should be, an expention of your phone and not a replacement, in my oppnion anyw.
May i ask what is that the Z1 is doing too much of?
On a side note, Pebble cost 150USD where you can get a Z1 for 50USD, so just looking at the cost Z1 get reach more users all over the world.

Smart marketing trick with Bitcoin in red envelope during Chinese new year.
However, Hongkongers are not very interested in cryptocurrency they have already enough freedom with their banking system.
Using bank or cards in HK is already freeish, they have Octopus cards (digital cash), ATMs on every street corner and they prefer to queue at thee bank then use internet banking.
Hong Kong is probably the worst place to launch a Bitcoin services if aimed at HK-Chinese.
This campaign is obviously aimed at foreigners living in Hong Kong and speculators from abroad trying to find a new exchange to trade on.
Looking at the site makes me wonder why is there so little information about the company or people behind it, is this another one man company run buy Anonymous?
I would love to test your service but the first impression does not give any confidence.

To OP. I would like to suggest a fifth personality type to your list as I didn't fit in any of the listed. 
5) A small online merchant selling worldwide, always looking for ways to cut costs. With Bitcoin as payment network I can lower transaction costs with about 5-10% compared to Paypal / credit card + bad currency conversion rates. And save even further with 0 fraud risk, the savings can be passed to buyer, and instant conversion to fiat eliminates the volatility risk.
The only looser in this case is Paypal and the banks, and once they can help me cut costs even further then Bitcoin then Bitcoin will become obsolete for my business.
I'm not a techgeek, but find it easy to inter grate Bitcoin payments, I simply use what ever makes sense to offer a better product and experience for our buyers.
As for the Liberaterians, pump and dump, rainbows, puppies and others they all will use, like and promote what ever meet their needs,  that's what happens in a free and open market.
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:58:06
Well if you would have spent few min i actually made a review of the watch, and other users have to.
I was sceptical about the 12 days stand buy time but im must say they got very close, im on my 4th day with 47% battery left.
It will take me a week to finish the battery test, but im documenting it with photos for the sceptics.
I never use the Wifi function as its connected via Bluetooh to my phone, and the watch get its data via phone, BUT the watch could be a life saver in some cases when all your other devices are dead or stolen and that you can actually directly connect to a wifi router is a nice bonus.
However SmartQ will release a Lite version where they stripped the wifi module for those who dont want to pay for it. For me its nice to have it there, i may need it one day.

Well we now have a choice with Bitcoin, we don't want banks to accept  Bitcoin do we?
The only people who care for regulations around Bitcoin are the selfish get-rich-quick geeks and the very same people who created the monopoly in the first place.
Get into Bitcoin and stay in Bitcoin as much as you can, exchanges are only for speculators too feed of non-speculators. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:05:25
I noticed this mentality everywhere you look where people discussing Bitcoin.
But this still does not explain why someone is down voting my cause that is actually promoting using the Bitcoin network for what it was designed for.
Also it does not make any sense not to spend if you can purchase the item cheaper with BTC.
Just purchase the same amount of BTC at the same time as you purchase the discounted item, this way you pay less USD for the item and keep the same balance of BTC.
I have a feeling that the greed in people is making them blind and not being able to use the full potential of this new technology.
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:33:42
I agree, keep it simple is the way to go.
I dont really care for other coins but displaying a total would make me keep the app running on my tablet for longer period and could help you earn few bucks displaying ads.

I totally support the concept of Namecoin, problem is that the target audience for the project are newcomers to Bitcoin and it would defeat the purpose if they could not access the .bit site.

Cute app. The font is too tiny impossible to see the amount on smaller drops that fall much faster. The background should be dark, or just black.
Would be cool to see a total of all drops since the app was launched.
I would love if the drops where to represent the transactions from different exchanges and display each currency ala fiatleak.

Why are the people behind this site super anonymous.
The closest to any info about the people or company behind this project is the word "we", which is mentioned all over the site.

@_date: 2014-01-29 17:59:12
* Maybe, TCP/IP, torrent, open source, wikipedia, github, 4chan, voip, internet communities ???
* How do you define "Bitcoin to be successful" ??? To me it is already very successful.
* How can it be more successful ?? When the value is higher or more people gain the freedom it provides ?
* Who says we have to??
* Banned by who? The people who try to control it or by people that use it?
* Does banned mean its not used or useful??

One question that always popup im my head every time i hear KryptoKit pitched is and that has never been addressed is;
1. If there is no user names and no passwords, what would prevent someone that gains access to my computer and browser to spend the balance from my KK wallet?
2. Or if someone or something (like a malware) just copied my browser and plugin data to later access my wallet from other machine?
Im paranoid holding private files locally on my everyday machine, and putting trust in a browser plugin is a big step for me to take.

Very nice interface, makes you wanna use it more.
Glad to see a useful Bitcoin map made in Sweden :)
I just dont like the name, i read this post last night and when i wanted to check the site again today i could not remember the url.
What is the meaning of "dero"?
If you guys want the site to grow i would suggest to find a better name for the international user base.
Also after a location search nothing happens when you click on Bitcoin pin on the map, and requires extra click to get to the info.
Anyhow, i wish you guys all the best, we need sites like this.

I do agree, that we should live together and love Bitcoin.
But my friend, i dont believe we can have a little bit of both.
I dont hate the banks or the government, they are people just like you and me. And we would most likely do the same if we where in their position, the system is supporting the 1% rule.
Dont expect banks or the governments to share their wealth or power with the people at the bottom, the change can only be achieved from the bottom by making small changes by the end users, and Bitcoin is making this possible.
By having Bitcoin regulated by the government will only add the centralization that it was made to eliminate, and Bitcoin will become just another product for big corporations to control.
Worst thing that may happen is that Bitcoin becomes Paypal 2.0 and a new much stronger crypto currency will lead the revolution to truly disrupt the old corrupted system and help more people to improve their life.
In order to make Bitcoin more successful and valuable we should use it to decentralize more aspects of our life's not to wait for the USD value to go up, that is the old systems promise to happy life.
We should have 1000s of smaller Google's, 1000s of smaller Paypal's, 1000s of smaller Overstock's to really benefit from this new technology that Bitcoin introduced, and that is only possible if current government say out of it.
Just like the Internet opened up for decentralization of information, but is now going back to same old centralized and regulated medium where the mass majority consume information controlled by one one big corporation and government.
Dont get me wrong, im not against government as such, its just that their current structure and role is as outdated as is the old banking and currency systems.
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:43:00

People have different definition of rich and free.
Some will may say rich is free, some may say free is rich.
My understanding is that Bitcoin was designed to give the control over your own funds back to you self, and away from banks and governments.
Buying Bitcoin just to enrich your self does not make any difference from what banks are doing today.
I am rich the moment im able to send money freely to anyone i want at minimal cost and friction, no matter 0.01BTC or 1000BTC.
The buy low sell high is just a distraction.

* Bellow are my mBTC's about the hearing:
Not much interesting being said during the hearings but i was surprised how many females where present (female bloggers??) who said women are not interested in Bitcoin.
There where also two suspect looking guys sitting to the left taking massive amount of HANDWRITEN notes (they know how to write 100% privte and safe from spying eyes), the third interesting observation was the only Chinese guy, and by the look of his face he is definetly not a hobby miner.
Also the joke made by Fred Wilson, saying:
"Everything that China bans, invest in" .... "the US allow Google, Twitter, Bitcoin, Facebook to operate here, Chinese government does not allow any of these companies to operate ... its about freedom"
Is just what the public likes to hear and its a very weak point to make in this context for these reasons:
1. Chinese government does not allow these comapnies to operate in China cos it wants to have monopoly on spying on their citizens with their own clones of the social networks, instead of having NSA and big US corporations data mining one of the biggest countires in the world.
2. Chinese goverment didnt ban Bitcoin, but that is a whole different debate that i dont want to get into here, you can read other reddit threads on this false statement.
3. "its about freedom", freedom for who? The big corporations to profit from Bitcoin fees just like the banks are doing or freedom for the US goverment to track every global business transaction, much cheaper.
This could be the worst year for Bitcoin ever, if the money greedy investors and control obsessed governments start messing too much with Bitcoin we will have, Google(NSA)-like web wallets, Amazon-like hosted mining and Twitter(NSA)-like PGP messaging, just more of the same just a little bit faster and cheaper.

I have no problem trusting Bitcoin, and seller does not care how you pay as long as he gets paid.
The problem is the buyer wont simply choose to pay with Bitcoin for a physical item shipped from the other side of the globe.

Agree, it was an missed opportunity to educate. And i was doing a face palm every time Gavin was trying to give an answer. You could see host was dying from the boring talk Gavin gave.
From the positive point of view, and maybe Gavin is clever enough not to educate the wrong people on a technology that was designed to benefit everyone equally.
The change can happen only from the bottom up.
Let Gavin talk to FBI, gov and the "guys" with ties and let them believe Bitcoin is just something for geeks and they no need to care to take control over it.
And let Andreas educate us why and how we need to take control over our lives for a more sustainable and fair world.

(excluding, camera men and witnesses)
* Female = 12
* Male = 15
* FBI (Dogecoin) agents = min. 2
* Chinese spy = 1

I have used 3 different Chinese trading platforms and even though BTC China lost the volume after the 3rd party payments where banned, my feeling is that BTC China is one of the most professional and trustworthy site out of China. I would compare them to Blockchian.info.
I think this move is to get some extra attention when other exchanges are are most likely faking their volumes, and to get more Chinese people interested in crypto as investment with a cheaper altcoin.
Litecoin also got overshadowed by new altcoins, so this is a natural move from a trading platform to get more trading and promote Litecoin, which already have good trading volumes on other Chinese exchanges.
Its hard to trust anyone when dealing with Bitcoin, but out of all the anonymous and public companies i came across, BTC China and Blockchain.info offers most transparency and security.

I just cant see how Bitcoin as payment can gain any momentum for international payments, if Paypal like systems are not implemented.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:51:05
To me there is to kinds of people supporting Bitcoin:
* People who just want to make big buck by buying low and hope to sell high. They will do, say, think everything to make a wider adoption and  integrated into every aspect of our life. JUST in hope of a higher value so they can retire young and never work again. Not caring that the high value they gain has to some from someone else pocket.
* People that believe that by using Bitcoin as a protocol to transfer value and by avoiding the traditional banking system will take some of the power and money from banks and improve life's of the people that need it most.
People with jobs and good standard of living in the west (most people here on reddit) dont need Bitcoin to improve their life, they can already buy everything they need using, bank, cards, paypal and easier then Bitcoin. 
That is why the tone here is mostly about hyping Bitcoin in hope to become a millionaire buy posting and typing words on reddit.
To me it does not matter if the value of a Bitcoin is 1USD or 10000USD as long as it does not profit the banks and corporations and i can still send value to other person without a third party, just like with cash.

What is the difference with Paypal or credit card payments if the  corporation, US gov and NSA knows exactly all your transactions?
I always thought Bitcoin was created to give power and control over  money back to its users and not as it is today, at least that is how it is being sold to us.
There are 1000s of unregulated systems and communities that exist and work perfectly fine.

Yes, i have multiple addresses and no watch only. I'm trying to make a quick send so i did not select from which address to send, i expected the quick send to use all my available funds to make the withdraw.

Maybe we can expect a possible solution for distributed ownership with smart contracts in the future.

Thanks for the update.
I knew they had the BTCC Vouchers for few days, but wonder how the Cash deposit works, do i have to travel to Shanghai and hand then cash IRL?

We should diversify the Bitcoin community if we want broader adoption not injection of venture capital.
Having white male geeks dominating the space will not make it easy for outsiders to take a step into this new kind of community.
Not everyone on this planet believes capitalism is the optimal system for good of the community.
The future is unknown, maybe something better then your name is ahead ;)

The lesson in learned looking at the DC community is that many of the pump and dump members have moved from from this sub to DC where its easier to troll. And as you said DC is for fun, BTC is too serious for young users that have more time than money. 
Its all good, there is a place for everyone in a free world.

Right, the original question got lost in the Namecoin discussion.
I was really thinking out loud when i posted this question here, and i guess we are back to trusting individuals when it comes to the ownership of .com domains.
In the USSR model everyone would own it, but only few would have the control.

Is that a bad thing that its forked and more users can take advantage of it?

Yes, i'm aware of this project but it requires the software to be accessed, or? 
@_date: 2014-11-13 12:32:10
You cant really blame banks for protecting their business.
BTC exchanges are basically banks run by geeks, using the "hate the banks" as their marketing slogan.
Keep your money out of banks and the BTC exchanges, instead engage in p2p transactions via localbitcoins or satoshi square.
@_date: 2014-11-29 11:22:09
That would be 341 transactions and about 30 addresses. I will contact their support and reply here when i get a clear answer.
Thanks to all for any suggestions.

Maybe you should drop the patriotic spirit and look at the source code instead. Do you trust your privacy will be better protected if the code or server is located in US, i no longer do.
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:22:35
I'm hoping the future brings a software solution to this, like Bitcoin did.
I choose not to "trust" lawyers ;)

Most people in this subreddit would support Andreas in becoming VC only if it meant higher profits on their BTC holdings and not for his opinions and ideals.
Hell, people here even clap hands when bankers try to regulate Bitcoin if that means faster profits for their BTC holdings.
To quote Andreas, the next foundation member or VC should be a non-male, non-white, non-US citizen to give it more credibility.
Andreas is already doing a great job in giving voice to the uncorrupted Bitcoin community dont push him into a position where he wont be able to speak freely on decentralization of the network.
Remember i said this first:
~~Andreas M. Antonopoulos is the **Bitcoin Buddha**  :)~~
I got a better one: Bitcoin Zeus :)

If everyone would follow your advice, Bitcoin would become the Ponzi scheme everyone is talking about.
I would suggest buy if you have money you can afford to loose, but not using the Bitcoin in your everyday life will only make the investment pointless.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:55:17
They would never let Anderas into that building, he would start a revolution :)
Agree, it was an missed opportunity to educate.
And i was doing a face palm every time Gavin was trying to give an answer.
You could see host was dying from the boring talk Gavin gave.
From the positive point of view, and maybe Gavin is clever enough not to educate the wrong people on a technology that was designed to benefit everyone equally. 
The change can happen only from the bottom up.
Let Gavin talk to FBI, gov and the "guys" with ties and let them believe Bitcoin is just something for geeks and they no need to care to take control over it.
And let Andreas educate us why and how we need to take control over our lives for a more sustainable and fair world.
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:14:56
I agree, very well said.

Just cos you had spent years in tech does not mean its too late to learn or use new technology, in my oppinion new technology can help the older genegatio as much as the younger.
Sorry i didnt know you where in your 60s, and having bad eyes is always a problem, trust me i know, i am farsighted my self.
And trust me i have no problem seeing the time on a 1.5-inch display where the numbers are far more much clear then most regular watches people ues every day.
Speaking of old users, my friend informed me that he gave the smart watch to his mother, she always missed his phones calls as she usally had the phone laying somewhere at home. Now every time he calls her, the watch will vibrate displaying a photo of her son on her arm notifying her of an "important" call.
I dont think there is any idea watching videos or photos on the watch, but with the Z1 you can remotly see or control the camera on your phone, not a super useful feature but it opens up possibilites not avaialble without the smart watch.
I dont really undersand that you mean by "You can't use a smartwatch as a phone extension", maybe you misunderstood me, when i said "expention of your phone" i didnt mean to use it for calling, but for remotely control your other functions on your phone, like reading alerts, notifications, messages, Bitcoin rate... we dont use a phone for calling in same extent...
Here are some very useful cases:
1. My phone is my my pocket or bag, im listening to music from my phone via earphones. Now if i want to pause, skip or replay a track and dont have a headset with remote on i can just look at my watch, and control the music  player via watch screen, i find it much more convenient then pulling out the phone every time.
2. I have a 6.3 inch Android phone, and trust me its a plain in the ass pulling out that monster every time i want to check the time or use a timer (which i often do during my test).
3. I can see notifications on the watch, saving me the time to pull out that monster if nothing important when on the move.
4. You can receive and reply SMS messages on the watch directly without typing on a keyboard.
5. Typing on a tiny screen will always be a tricky task, well there is a smart solution for this too in cases you really have to type some text like when login in on a app or service for the first time. Just open up the sync app, type the text on your phone and send it wirelessly to your watch. 
There are many more use cases but i think i stop here, my idea with this post was to let Bitcoin users know that you can now purchase a smart watch at discounted price and not to force a product they dont want.
I guess i should have used another title for the post :)
UPDATE to tippecanoe42
On the too small screen part, the screen is actually big enough, for old people and for people with fat fingers, as long as the interface is well adopted for this kind of usage. No one is complaining Apple Nono with 1.5 inch touch screen was too small.

Do you remember which episode it was, or at least when?
I have listened to all their episodes and cant recall this site being mentioned.

I still have not been able to withdraw all my funds, so still hullabaloo.
I never stated the company was insolvent but my wallet on their service is.
I was not able to find any solution reading their FAQ, so i turned to the pros here.
I have nothing to apologize for, best outcome will be if i can find a solution and the reason why i was not able withdraw my funds.
And hopefully others will find this info useful as i could have when searching this sub before posting for advice.
Mandrik from blockchain has replied here and offered his help, so help is on the way.

You missed the whole point with my comment, if everyone would keep all the bitcoins and never spent then like you suggested, it would make it a  ponzi scheme.

Strange that they removed the (no surcharge):

Debate has started, anyone watching?
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:03:57
You just discarded millions of poor people around the world, that can save 20 cents a day for 100 days, just to purchase and own a 20USD mobile phone that can actually lift them out of poverty help them to earn more then the 1USD they where living on before.
Its hard for for westerners to understand that even the poor can benefit from today's technologies.
People in poor countries can actually earn and save more from a technology like Bitcoin then you and me, since we already have everything we need to live a healthy life.
Its the selfish greed that blinds people from seeing the good features in Bitcoin.

And your comments are very much noise to me, and that is the beauty of this and other online platforms, what is dust for you is source of new knowledge for others.
Reading your comments reminds me how selfish, self centered and short sighted ppl can be. Just because you have read this whole subreddit from first to last post does not mean every reader did.
Like me who just joined and have been reading, searching, clicking through 100s of posts for hours, reading all the "dust" i finally got to an interesting post.
You say its a boring topic, so why are you spending so much time here?
Wouldnt it much better to create a new post on how boring this post is?
Use your right to downvote, have your say and move on to a topic where you can actually contribute with something on the topic.

Im sure there will be ways to deposit fiat very soon, if China gov wanted to kill Bitcoin business they would have done so already.
You dont want 100 million Chinese depositing RMB and buying Bitcoin in one week.

@_date: 2013-12-22 15:16:07
There was zero discussions on any regulations of Bitcoin, the debate was only focused on the risks involving investment in Bitcoin by Chinese.
I have a feeling that this TV debate was a signal to Chinese speculators to be more more careful and not to rush to Bitcoin to fast.
@_date: 2013-12-24 09:35:40
I can come up with 1000s of ways how poor unbanked people could benefit from Bitcoin but you can start reading this:
You dont need expensive US data plan to send few characters via mobile network, poor Africans are already benefiting by being able to communicate and transfer money jumping the expensive infrastructure we are so used to.
A worker in Africa can get his salary payed via SMS at near zero cost via M-PESA, something we  in the civilized world cant do without going through old banking systems and expensive data plans.
I know its hard for most westerners to be open minded when it comes to Bitcoin as they are living a comfortable world where everything is already provided by a company or government.
Starving people will find ways to survive and earn or save few cents, either by digging through mountains of trash or by transacting their funds via Bitcoin.

For those who want to watch the TV debate, it can now be seen on iqiy:
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:38:19
Bitcoin in Chinese is 比特币, prononced (beetubee).
They mostly talk about to invest or not in Bitcoin, which is the theme of this debate. Very little on the useful functions on Bitcoin transactions.
Ill try to update if something interesting is said.
@_date: 2013-12-22 15:50:55
What rumors?
@_date: 2013-12-22 15:37:00
Debate is over.
Interesting part was a poll before debate where they asked the people in the studio:
What would you prefer to invest in?
2% answered Bitcoin, 98% answered stocks or estate or gold.
After the debate new poll was made:
What would you invest in, during 2014?
7% answered Bitcoin, 93% answered stocks or estate or gold.
