The issue raised by OP is really serious, specially if you live in or have family living in not-so-safe places.
You tell a friend, who tells a friend, who tells a guy, who tells another guy, and when you know, a family member of yours is kidnapped and the criminals know exactly how much money you've got to pay.
I'm pretty sure that 1k BTC today is more than enough to motivate many criminals in many places of Latin America, for example, to kidnap someone. Actually, much less than that would probably suffice.
So yeah, OP is right. Preserve your financial privacy, not only for your own good but for the good of those you love too. Even if you happen to live in a safe place, why taking the risk?

Yes, as long as it's voluntary. But obviously, if they're working with "regulators", that's because it's not meant to be voluntary.


In a way, but what about all the subjects of these countries' governments? Take the US for example. Its weight in the international economy is so huge that its government can afford to implement something like FATCA. If the USG was to force its victims to use whitelisted addresses, that would harm Bitcoin as a whole. And if the USG does it, you may be sure that many other totalitarian-wannabe governments will follow the lead. If USA + EU + China governments all get together to enforce this shit, then Bitcoin privacy is screwed.


I don't know - can't imagine how -, but I'd like to know too.

He's probably talking about either Dominica or St Kittis and Nevis, the two Caribbean island countries most reputable for their economic citizenship programs.

Most governments allow foreigners to own and run businesses. Why wouldn't they?


Canada, Panama, Chile, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, New Zealand, Germany etc. There are many options. A good starting point for his research could be this site:

You know very well it won't remain voluntarily opt-in as soon as governments step in. You know pretty much where this can (will?) lead. And yet you're doing it, shamelessly. You profoundly disgust me, Mr Waters. 
Anyways, we should know that there are people of your kind out there, willing to help totalitarian governments to spy on their subjects. It's up to the decent and bright people among the Bitcoin community to find a way to protect innocents from you. I can only hope the "good guys" win.

Nobody's attempting to white-list cash bills, and yet they're accepted everywhere. So stop with this hypocritical false dichotomy. You know there's no actual need to rape people's privacy. But you seem desperate to, regardless.

Many governments propose immigration programs for entrepreneurs and investors. Many governments also allow you to immigrate into their jurisdiction if you're "rich enough". I bet Mike fits the standards of "rich enough" of most governments.

 Caldwell, sorry to be rough but, in face of this, either you emigrate, or somebody else outside FinCEN's jurisdiction will replace you. It will not happen super fast since you've managed to acquire people's trust, and a competitor won't build that up so fast. But it will happen eventually.
For your own good, and that of all your costumers, consider getting yourself out of the reach of this authoritarian government. Fighting them in courts is very unlikely to be the best strategy. Exit is much better than voice here.
Regardless of your next steps, thank you for all the work you've done so far. Casascius coins are already legendary. ;)
(EDIT: If you happen to take my advice seriously, perhaps the following site would be a good starting point for your research:  )

Mr Moran, please read this: [US has Already Ceded Dominance in Bitcoin Trading](
**The US has the highest number of Bitcoin nodes (~25%), yet only ~2% of Bitcoin trades are happening in its jurisdiction.** The reason for this are the absurd, utterly expensive, slow and complicated regulatations business need to comply with. Just read about how hard it is to become a Money Transmitter all over the country to have an idea of what I'm talking about.
Meanwhile, in Canada, Bitcoin is flourishing. They even have [Bitcoin ATMs there]( Why? Because the [Canadian financial authority decided not to regulate Bitcoin]( Their Bitcoin business need no special licenses to operate. Recently, Hong Kong's financial authority just [said the same]( And in Germany, [bitcoins are exempt from capital gains taxes after one year]( I've personally heard of bitcoiners moving to Germany after this, taking their money with them.
It's not only in Bitcoin related business that the US is staying behind. Economic freedom as a whole has been falling fast in the US during the last decade. Just check the data from the [Fraser Institute]( or the [Heritage Foundation](
If you sincerely care about not letting the US fall behind, then please repeal every Bitcoin regulation, and fight for more economic freedom!

Don't give them ideas. They will attempt to if they believe they can.

AFAIK Zerocoin is not feasible (requires too much resources). But honestly I don't understand how zerocoin works.

This. Or to a country with territorial taxation.

Living in tiny islands can be tough. But Mike doesn't need to go that far to escape FinCEN. He doesn't need to immediately drop his US citizenship. Simply by relocating to another jurisdiction, he'll no longer be at FinCEN's reach.
The IRS reach, OTOH, is another matter. The USA and Eritrea are the only two countries in the world that will tax you by citizenship instead of residence. To escape USG taxation, the only viable legal choice is indeed to renounce US citizenship. 
But, for example, in Canada you can naturalize after 3 years of legal residence, if I'm not mistaken. If you can handle the frozen weather, Canada's standard of living shouldn't be disappointing. And I don't think that FINTRAC will bother if he sells his coins there.

It's not just one particular bank. It's the jurisdiction you're in.

I'll leave this here: 
You should really consider getting at least your wealth out of the US as soon as possible.
