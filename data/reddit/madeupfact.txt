Somebody needs to start a Kickstarter project for a safe Bitcoin wallet so that lay people like me can use it without having to read 100 000 pages on how Bitcoins works. It should be easy to use.

I bought them some time ago, forgot about these, discovered r/Bitcoin and did some reading here. I knew how much a Bitcoin is worth, but while betting it seemed so little to bet .5-1 Bitcoin.

I bought at around USD 53, which was a new all time high at the time. I saw the value of my bitcoins rise by almost 400%. So yes, buying at an all time can be a winning strategy sometimes. Granted I lost most of it again, because I wanted to keep my bitcoins just a few more days.

I understand. I was just throwing in an idea as this seems to be one of the concerns in the article. I have no intention of starting a new blockchain or trying to change any rules. Bitcoin works for me as it is, but a little less volatility would certainly be nice.

Hey I share exactly the same view. Unfortunately with all the reading I did on Bitcoin, it seems that we are a very small minority. I found that with economics it is almost as hard as to convince a hard core religious person to change their view.
How would you remove the hard cap? The only solution I see is to create a new currency next to Bitcoin.

Hey that looks very interesting. Thanks for sharing, I will definitely buy one of these! Hopefully it will also include some kind of back up which I will keep in my safe deposit box.

Yeah, that's bad Karma for making stuff up from time to time. But what I said above is true!

Okay, OP just changed his reply any now my answer doesn't make sense anymore...

Bitcoin noob here, I tried to make a bet an entered my wallet address. How can they collect if I lose the bet?

Because what matters is the relative change of the value. I.e. if the value of a bitcoin in USD went from $10 to $20, it would be the same for an investor as if it went from $100 to $200. (Doubling your investment.) On a logarithmic, this would be shown by the same distance on the scale, while on a normal scale the $100-to-$200 part would seem much more impressive and volatile.

Thanks! I just bet 4 bitcoins on this site without realizing that this is quite some money... I still need to get used to the value of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-08 17:27:34
That's 40 bucks!

Just a random thought: What about some sort of voting concept? Everybody who holds bitcoins can vote on what kind of policy should apply (proportional to the amount of bitcoins they hold). We would have some sort of decentralized central bank.

Thanks! This EFS thing sounds very interesting. I will try to make it work. All I need now is a smart card.

I don't see how that couldn't go wrong.

Yes, actually. You can't compare the price of Apple and Google stocks. It wouldn't make sense as the two companies have a different number of shares in circulation. But it does make sense to compare their relative change in value over a fixed period of time, just as with silver and Bitcoin.
