That's not mean, thanks for responding. I searched for answers on google but wasn't able to find any coherent answers which led me to ask the question on reddit

I don't quite understand how mining works at all, or verification. Would you mind explaining them to me? 
What I'm trying to ask is: instead of having a small group of miners add blocks, why can't the computers of people engaging in transactions automatically add those transactions to the blockchain and that process be continually verified by an automated script on every user's computer?

Because they can't necessarily find users using public keys, I'd assume? Correct me if I'm wrong

Why do we need miners to make new blocks? When a transaction occurs why can't there be software built into everyone's computers that automatically records it and adds the public key to the block chain?

One last question: why can't the people on two ends of a transaction verify a transaction and broadcast the message of verification to all users, thus ensuring that only messages verified by both ends of a transaction are considered valid on the blockchain (i.e., you can add your own things to your own ledger, but it's irrelevant since only verified messages count)? This would ensure that everyone involved in a transaction verifies it, and out of self-interest the person giving money wouldn't agree to give more on the ledger than they initially agreed to in the terms of their exchange.

That's really cool. I didn't know that. Thanks!

If it were a violation of international treaties, could other governments shoot down the satellite? Seeing as bitcoin is a major threat to the power of governments, would they have any incentive to take actions that would fuel its growth?

But if what someone wrote disagreed with everyone else's copy of the blockchain (something you might verify every time you do a transaction or periodically) then the system could invalidate it, no?

Don't you know the public signature or address of the person you're sending the coins to? What's the disadvantage of having a cryptocurrency where the person sending money validates this with a signature, saying "I am sending X coins to address Y," and the fact that the person sending the money actually owns it is simply automatically verified by the computer of the person receiving it, by crosschecking that with other preexisting, two-way verified transactions on the blockchain? I'm sorry if there's an obvious flaw with this that I'm not seeing.

Wouldn't oppressive governments, such as those in China and the Middle East, still jam the satellite to prevent its use?

How exactly do miners "provide security?" And why can't the preexisting system be decentralized? Everyone actively using Bitcoin (to my understanding) has a copy of the blockchain, why can't the program for verifying transactions also be owned by all users?

Because they're no longer subject to a coercive system in which their money is constantly losing value and they have no sense of privacy or freedom?

Convenience will increase as more people adopt. And the sort of inflation seen with fiat currency is not "natural" nor is it necessary for an economy to survive.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:31:44
I think the idea is such a mechanism wouldn't be necessary. If a few people hold a ton of the currency and are unwilling to exchange it for goods and services, ordinary people and the market at large will adjust and increase the value of currency to adjust with this. Ultimately, everyone would go about and adjust their currency, ignoring the few people holding the vast majority of existing BTC because that wouldn't really matter if they aren't doing anything with it. 
I might be wrong, please correct and explain if I am.
