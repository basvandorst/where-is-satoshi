ETH was never a reliable store of value.  The ETH/ETC fork though did show people that forks aren't scary.  I think it encouraged people who want to fork to a bigger block size even more it really wasn't the fiasco you think.

I think what people are missing here is that even if the block size is very large that doesn't mean miners have to accept low fee transactions into their blocks.  As long as a large enough portion of miners refuse to accept low fee transactions that should support a fee level that will sustain miners.  Right now miners don't really care because they can profit off the block reward alone but as that goes away I think you will see them outright refuse transactions with fees below a certain threshold.

I used them for a small order a few months back my thoughts are as follows...
- No easy way to get money in and out, I used a money order
- There were fees for deposits and withdrawals, even fees for BTC withdrawals
- If you want to withdraw more than 1BTC you have to email support and wait for them to whitelist your account
- When I was using it the volume was really low
- There wasn't any API to automate trading
- site was a bit sluggish in general though nicely designed
Over all I'd say it was an average experience.

I thought about that but they only show up in the YouTube player on YouTube.com or on embedded videos not on devices like TVs, or mobile so you would be missing a huge segment.  But the bigger problem would be figuring out a way to make a QR code in an annotation.  It's my understanding that annotations are text only so it would be tricky.
Something like this might work,  but again if you had a serious channel and wanted to do it you would probably just start overlaying a QR code in your videos when you did the editing.

Cool, as an aside I've been using various BTC exchanges and brokerages of about a year now in the beginning I signed up for anything that looked good enough to not be a Nigerian email scam but after wasting my time getting verified on half a dozen exchanges (Gox, Bitstamp, CampBX, Coinbase, CoinMkt, Justcoin, Kraken) only one of which is still viable for my needs (coinbase) I think the following information at minimum needs to be easily accessible  for me to even consider creating an account....
1. What kind of trading platform are you, full exchange (ie: Bitstamp), brokerage (ie: coinbase), or FX pair-trade (ie: CoinSetter)
2. What options are there for deposit and withdrawal of fiat currency
3. What crypto currencies do you support?  Can I deposit and withdraw them
4. What are you deposit and withdrawal service fees
5. What are your trading fees
6. What jurisdictions do you accept customers from, jurisdictions you expect to accept customers from in the near future?
7. Do you have an API
Any exchange that can't tell you those things up front is just wasting your time.

I think you under estimate the politics involved in the Islamic religion.  What is considered proper in Islam is very much driven by interpretations issued by religious leaders.  They often apply tortured readings of old texts to answer a modern question in a manner that simply fits their agenda instead of being consistent with any principle of the religion.  (One particularly nutty example is in some branches of Islam they rationalize that prostitution is ok by couching it in terms of "temporary marriage"  ie: if you want to higher a hooker you marry him/her for the evening then you can fornicate to your heats delight w/o running afoul of Islam's no sex outside of marriage rules.  When you are done the marriage has an expiration date and all is ok in the eyes of Islam.)
The purpose of most major religions is largely to control people by getting them to focus on trivial matters over things that are much more important to their long term well being.

I agree there is that risk for them but the fact that credit card fees are higher for smaller merchants means that maintaining the status quote gives them a competitive advantage.

Uber Drivers are the only people who have control over a customers rating.  The system is very quick and automated and not bureaucratic.  When a customer messes up a drivers car that takes them off the road until they can get it cleaned up.  So not only are they having to pay to clean up whatever mess the passenger made but they then lose out on all the revenue they would have made since they had to cut their hours short.  It literally probably costs the driver several hundred dollars.  Making a mess in an Uber is a HUGE dick move not something a few bits or bucks can make right.

The dishonest person removes the sticker and puts their own sticker on it then goes and tells the idiot they still owe them $5 The idiot looks at the $5 that the dishonest person has and says that's not my sticker I must still owe you 5 bucks!  here is another 5!  On and on.  mean while intelligent people don't pay attention to the sticker they look at the serial number on the bill which can't be changed and tell the dishonest person they are full of crap and to get lost before they call the cops.

If you are a casual seller on eBay it is pretty much impossible to avoid using Paypal.  The only other option is "Merchant Credit Cards" which is only available to high volume sellers.  eBay fees for a typical person who is just looking to clean a few things out of the closet a couple times a year are 10% for the eBay fee and 2.9% + 30 cents for the Paypal fee.  Of course eBay and Paypal are the same company and they don't let you use anything but Paypal so effectively you are paying 12.9% + 30 cents for every sale including on shipping.  It's a HUGE crack of crap but at the same time no one has come up with a way to challenge the dominance of their network effects even though they are pretty much charging monopoly pricing.

People assume the Fed would hate bitcoin because if it became _really_ successful it might become something of a new world reserve currency so to speak and undermine some of their current power.  You have to look at it though from a wider perspective though.  
No country can maintain their status as the world reserve currency forever the US has only held this status for about the last 70 years.  Recently you see countries making bi lateral trade deals that cut out the USD all together.  The Fed is probably thinking that given the choice between the reserve currency being controlled by another country or the reserve currency being something like Bitcoin where no single country has control the better option is Bitcoin.

It's funny you hear people talk about Tulip Mania all the time in reference to bubbles but it's pretty clear they've never actually read anything about it.  According to Wikipedia which cites a academic paper it is normal for new breeds of flowers to initially have a very high price and then depreciate to 1-2% of that once the variety becomes common and more widely available.  Tulips were not native to Europe and where introduced right before the mania hence they were only following the pattern that is natural of new flower varieties. So unless you think Bitcoin some how shares properties with rare flowers comparing the two is dumb.

Yeah, it's rumored based on an IRC chat with Gox employee some months back that they only process like 10 USD wire transfer withdrawals per day there is no other way to get USD out.  Rumors of their "you can jump the line for a 5% fee" scheme have also been floating around for a while.  On the other hand they don't seem to have a problem accepting deposits via USD wire transfer.
Who knows what is really going on there but if I were running an insolvent company that had several million USD seized by the US government; limiting withdrawals to an absurdly low number and offering to push high value transactions to the front of the line for a 5% fee would be a great way to try and shore things up and recoup the loss w/o having to admit you are broke and passing the cost of your own incompetence onto your customers in the process.

If this was Mt.Gox's first snafu I think people would be willing to cut them more slack but this is just the most recent in a long line of bone headed moves.  Before this it was the USD withdrawal fiasco which is still on going and has been for ~9 months now.
Also the bug in the reference wallet is not the same bug, sure they both have to do with the malleability but no one is going to loose their coin over the wallet bug.

Coinbase the most expensive BTC payment processor charges 1% on each side of a trade so call it 2% total no matter the size of a transaction, on a given sale.  
Compare that to a modern credit card processor like Stripe who is generally considered to be pretty progressive in their practices and fees.    They charge 2.9% + 30 cents  for transactions under $100 that is minimum 3.2% and for a smaller $10 and under transactions that is 5.9% at minimum. That is ~30% more expensive than BTC in the best case.  This is still early so the costs of BTC transactions will almost certainly come down.

I had a friend who ordered from them and after getting the product many months late the power supply died within a week, to be fair BFL offered to replace it, but I wouldn't call that "solid engineering".  Yes, bitcoin is risky but that doesn't give a company free reign to defraud their customers by saying they will deliver a product on X date and then not ship until X+9 months and not offer the customer the option to cancel the order and a full refund in light of the delay.
Because of the time sensitive nature of a bitcoin miners value; advertising one date for delivery and then not allowing customers to cancel their order if that date isn't met is clearly fraud.  The fact that Bitcoin is risky doesn't excuse fraudulent, dishonest, or illegal behavior by anyone.

You must have missed the part where it said two days was typical but if they had a pause in production they burned in the machines until new machines were available to replace them.  That the actual testing of a machine only took 10 - 30 minutes and that they could have done the testing on test-net.  There obvious purpose was to make money at the customers expense through delaying shipments and using customer money to finance their operations that is as damming as you can get.

It would have been easier to do if they had be able to find an investor to take it over before the truth leaked then they could have bought up all those cheap coins.
That said with the size of the loss (~400 Million) I think the chance they will find someone to step in is pretty slim.  Even if they do I doubt the customers will get 100% of their deposits back.  Another problem is all the legal liability surrounding the company now that anyone that steps in to save the company would be taking on.  Probably just not worth it.  They should divide up what money is left among the customers and forget Gox ever existed.

Paypal is a crappy company but I would guess that the following things caused this...
1. You took in a lot of money and haven't shipped anything out yet.  Paypal does not look kindly on things that don't ship immediately because it puts them on the hook for refunding the customer if you screw up.
2. If you have shipped things out you haven't entered the tracking numbers for each Paypal transaction.
3. You should use Paypal's invoice feature to request money from your customer and you should use a separate Paypal account specifically for your business that is separate from your personal account.  You are the one benefiting from zero fees being charged as Paypal charges the merchant not the customer sending the money.

You could do a few things.  
 - One in the near term just hold the Bitcoin for 30 days or whatever is a sufficient to ensure the sale is complete.  Since the currency is limited in supply even though it is somewhat volatile in the short term you can be relatively certain it will generally go up over time.  Since at first your BTC customer sales will probably be small this might be an acceptable risk to get started.
 - Two there are companies like CoinSetter.com that can help you hedge against price fluctuations.  This seems like the most logical thing to do in the long run once everything is mature.  I don't understand what the market is like currently though in terms of companies providing this kind of service or how it works.  This is worth investigating though
 - You can present the customer with contract terms at the time of the sale that clearly stipulate that the exchange rate risk is on them.  This is the least desirable in my opinion.  If you try to go the USD refund route w/o presenting clear unambiguous contract terms to the customer at the time of the sale stating the exchange rate risk is on them then you are opening yourself up to lawsuits.
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:48:38

It's a nice feel good idea and I can understand why people who had money in Gox might find this proposal comforting but this is just unworkable for any of a number of reasons.
Running a Bitcoin exchange is not easy work fact aside that Mt.Gox lost a massive amount of coins due to their incompetence; They still had all the problems of securing banking partners and complying with the appropriate MSB regulations in the US and other countries.
In the case of Gox they had very little of the banking and regulation piece sorted out so they hadn't even solved one of the major problems of running an exchange.
The best thing that could possibly happen right now is that Gox's remaining assets are split among it's depositors and paid out to them quickly so they can take what money is left and invest it in a productive asset instead of having it tied up in the Gox BS factory for eternity.

That page says, "International sales 3.9% transaction fee plus a fixed fee based on currency received" so if the buyer isn't in the same country as the seller they are really going to get screwed on the fees.
I think what you are trying to say is that because this guy is a buyer of the BTC he isn't going to pay the fees directly.  He is going to pay that cost in the form of a less favorable BTC/fiat exchange rate though.  No matter how you want to slice it a reputable exchange in the local jurisdiction will probably be a better deal.

Yes, the security of your Truecrypt volume depends entirely on the way you configured the encryption.  If you just used a passphrase and the passphrase was not sufficiently long then someone could easily guess it.  The most secure way to configure true crypt is with a key file and long passphrase.  Since you didn't say anything about a key file I'm assuming you didn't use one since it would defeat the purpose of putting the volume on dropbox hence the security of your volume depends on your passphrase and generally speaking people aren't good about picking good pass phrases.

If you look at what Gold did in the last crisis it initially dropped quite a bit and then rallied.  The issue is that in a collapse people often need to raise cash to satisfy margin calls and other debts so they have to sell their hard assets.  Consequently the market is flooded with sellers and prices go down.  One the initial shock passed though the price of Gold went up because people were scared of inflation.  Bitcoin is better than Gold since you can easily use it to pay for things where as you usually need to convert gold to a local currency first.

Most people would just call that plain theft.  What makes it even worse is that the police departments get to keep most of what they seize and use it to buy equipment or dole out bonuses and over time pay etc... so you can see where that might get problematic really quick.

The fact that an individual can get a fair shake in court when they are wronged is one of the strong suites of America.  
The OP didn't sue them into oblivion he only asked for what was rightfully his plus the costs of having to take BFL to court to get it back (You can see the judgment on the courts website if you do a records search for the case number it is "$12,454.92 + PRE/POST INTEREST + COSTS + OTHER").  
BFL could have prevented this at any time simply by following ethical business practices and straight forward laws.  If they can't do that then they deserved to be sued into oblivion and with any luck the company that takes their place ie: KNC, ASICMiner, CoinTerra will act ethically.
Not addressing wrong doing in business transactions not only cheats the customer but it cheats the offending companies competitors as well.

No it doesn't.  Laws and regulations are two different things.  In a democracy a law is a rule passed by an elected governmental body defining things that are legal and illegal.  A regulation on the other hand is a rule made up by unelected bureaucrats who are given power via a law to make up rules as they see fit to achieve a goal within a area of authority.

Well if they were on the up and up they should have had the Bitcoin and USD being traded on hand but because people leave USD and BTC sitting on the exchange as if it were a bank that allows a dishonest exchange to hide losses as long as the inflows of USD and BTC are greater than the out flows.  Since their books are private there really is no way to tell if they are being honest until things like this happen.  When you hold coins on MtGox they are under MtGox's control and the only way in which they are "yours" are because MtGox has an entry in their accounting software that says "X of these are nighcry's" That is why people say you shouldn't store coins on an exchange and should withdraw them to a private wallet because then you aren't vulnerable to unethical behavior by the exchange operator who holds the private keys protecting your coins.  Of course you are responsible for the security at that point which bares it's own risks to be aware of.

So, the reason LIFO is useful is that if you want to both buy things on occasion with BTC and also hold an amount of BTC as a long term investment you can buy BTC as you make purchases and not have to worry about gains on it since you buy it and then use it immediately.

@_date: 2014-02-21 01:08:13
Yeah, I mean I think the explanation is simple, incompetence.  The real trouble began when Gox management decided they didn't need to register with FinCEN in the US and decided to try and just use a normal business bank account to move all that customer money to Japan.  From there it was all down hill for all we know they've lost a massive amount of cash and coin to incompetence that's where my bet is at at this point.

No.  You have "laws" and "regulations" a law is something passed by congress and a regulation is a rule that has the force of law but was made by a government agency under broad powers delegated to them over a specific area of responsibility with the aim of achieving a certain goal.  
Laws typically prohibit some obvious activity that is morally wrong or otherwise undesirable.  Regulations on the other hand are just rules that a government agency tries to use to achieve some subjective social goal.  
You can think if it as the difference between telling someone _what_ to (a law ie: don't scam people) do vs telling someone _how_ to do it (ie: in order not to scam people you need to have a business license).  For example say you pay someone to go get your car washed you let it be known that your car should be returned clean the the end of the day with no damage.  On the other hand you might tell them exactly how to wash the car where to do it what kind of soap to use, the time of day the temperature of water and prohibit them from driving the car on highways if they take it to a car wash.
Does that make sense?  Regulation are guidelines meant to prevent bad things from happening but laws are the bad things we don't want to happen.  just because there are no guidelines about how to keep from doing the bad thing to someone doesn't mean you aren't responsible if you do that bad thing.

Well just as an example; California Penal Code Section 485 stipulates that if you find money you need to make "reasonable and just efforts to find the owner." Otherwise, you're "guilty of theft."
You can argue that the OP gave the money to the guy vs lost it but the salient point is the guy found money in his Bitcoin address that he knew didn't belong to him and was informed by the op that it was transmitted by accident.  Ethically he has an obligation to return it and I think there is a good chance he legally has an obligation as well.

Because ebay hides the fact that they charge that 10% until the end of the month when they send you an unitemized bill for fess and automatically charge your credit card for the fess so he probably doesn't realize yet.  Ebay's fees are not clearly stated on their website and they do their best to hide how high they really are from people but for the typical person just selling a couple things a year the fees are between 13-14% of the total transaction including shipping costs.

No, up until now people speculated that it was social engineering and to get a double withdrawal you needed to have a MtGox customer service employee reissue it.  This is saying that reissues were built-in to the software so there was no human intervention or social engineering needed to steal all the coins.  Basically the worst case scenario since it means theft could be pulled off on a large and automated scale.

* Never use Mt.Gox for anything ever.
* Never buy or sell Bitcoin using PayPal ever.
* Never do business with Butterfly Labs (aka 'BFL').
* Never pre-order Bitcoin Mining hardware.

My question would be, say I hold some amount of BTC long term as an investment and any time I buy something with BTC I purchase just enough to cover that purchase.  In the eyes of the IRS which BTC is actually getting used for the purchase?  the BTC I just bought and hence has no gain or loss or the BTC I had been holding and maybe had a large gain or loss on?

Sure, I'm not saying it would be easy or assured by any stretch of imagination.  But I got my money as far away from Gox as possible in spring 2013 since it looked like it was just a matter of time before the other shoe dropped.

I don't think I have enough data to make a conclusion but the cases of fraud that I experienced came from South America and Indonesia.

I think it has to do with the fact that ACH transactions take ~3 days to settle so in order to lock in a buy at the current price Coinbase has to put up the money now and then they get paid back when the ACH transaction comes through in 3 days.
So in times of heavy buying they will end up using up all their cash reserves and can't do any more buys until cash from the pending transactions comes in.
This problem doesn't happen on the sell side so if you are seeing that message you know it is because of heavy buying activity.

They are choosing to put themselves in that situation.  It takes a lot of will power if you are poor not to spend money stupidly.

To me that is obvious so why is BFL advertising like they can deliver immediately when they clearly should know they can not if not because it is obvious then because they have months and months of experience now.
If I sold you meat for delivery 3 days from now but didn't ship it for 3 months and it showed up rotted and moldy but you ate it anyways and you didn't die that doesn't make shipping rotten meat right.

Yes if the miners are actually used for a significant amount of time before reselling them they should disclose that or call them refurbished.

This could explain why some miners are going along with core's nonsense.  I don't think it explains why Classic supporters support classic though.  Low Bitcoin price dissuades additional investment in mining capacity as soon as the price pops interest in mining explodes.

Sure the 1% of alt-coins that have anything of value to add but screwing with the block time, and maximum coin generation isn't innovation it's just playing virtual central banker.  The reason people and companies create alt-coins more often than not is because they want to benefit financially from the control of the currency.  That is why you see all these for profit company's coming out with a bunch of drivel along the lines of "I like Bitcoin for it's protocol but it's going to fail as a currency"

It's easy to stay anonymous when no one is looking for you but a lot harder to do so if you continue to communicate after gaining notoriety and everyone and their mother is trying to track you down.  
The fact that Bitcoin had gained enough notice to garner an invitation for Gavin to speak at the CIA was probably a sign to Satoshi that if he wished to protect his anonymity indefinitely he needed to lower his profile.
As for why anonymity was important to Satoshi I think there are quite a few reasons that any prudent and intelligent person would act as he did.  In no particular order...
1. He was/is in possession of a massive stash of coins that were only growing more valuable by the day.  Such wealth makes you a target for any number of scams, criminals and annoyances.
2. If he didn't remove himself he would have become a benevolent dictator of sorts over what might become the most powerful economic force in the world since the post WW2 US dollar.  
3. Rightfully or wrongly he would be a target for any government who was upset about Bitcoin or digital currencies in general for whatever reason.  Controlling the issuance of currency and monetary policy is arguably the most important power a nation has.  Bitcoin is going to counter that traditional power structure.

Your Bittorrent example totally misses the point If instead of contacting a peer directly for a piece of the file you asked someone else to get it for you first then send it to you that is more what lightening is like.
The fact of the matter is that witness data is still data that needs to be propagated by the network but isn't included in the part of the block that people have to pay for.  You seem to be using semantics here to dismiss this.  Does the witness data have to be propagated between nodes?  If so is it included in the calculation for the fee to be paid to miners?  If not how is that not a discount on a per byte basis?  Required network bandwidth matters as much as disk space when it comes to per block data.  You don't have to go to to see people discussing the witness data discount.

That is the natural way the system will end up because people are going to want to be connected to a counter party with the least number of hops to everyone else.

Lightening needs transaction malleability fixed to work securely is my understanding.

I don't buy that.  Miners can always set their own minimum fee policies and can always choose to produce a smaller block to restrict supply.  All limiting the block size to 1MB does is takes power away from the miners to control the supply of their product, block space.

Raising the block size isn't going to lead to increased centralization.  We have pruning nodes now that let you run a node on minimal disk space and drive costs are dropping while capacities are increasing.  
On the mining front thin blocks or compact blocks have made it so that relay times for blocks are fast between miners eliminating concerns about the great firewall.
3 years ago everyone was worried that ghash.io was going to 51% attack Bitcoin and where are they now?  Not even big enough to have their own pie-slice on the hastrate distribution graph. [0] In fact if you follow hash rate distribution the share of the hashrate controlled by small pools has grown recently and the number of small pools has proliferated.
Bottom line, the way to better decentralize something is to get more people to use it.  The more users you have the more price will go up the more people will want to run nodes, and mining pools.  In short user growth is what leads to a healthy decentralized ecosystem.  To get more users though you need block space for them.  I'm not opposed to people implementing lightning networks and letting people decide if they want to use them but giving them no choice by strangling traditional Bitcoin transaction space is not the right thing to do.  The most pressing problem in Bitcoin right now is running up against the ~300k per day limit because if transactions stop growing that means users stop growing and stagnation is what causes centralization.

I'm not sure what specifically had in mind but centralization is one of the biggest concerns people have brought up with lightening I'm kind of surprised you haven't heard it.  Here is an article discussing it...

That doesn't sound like decentralization that description makes Lightening sound like the current Banking system.  In your example Alice would be the bank.
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:13:26
No, you just say that to attack me instead of arguing your point on facts.  
How does Alice not have some control over your Bitcoins if you have to continuously monitor the Bitcoin network to ensure she isn't cheating you and broadcasting stale transactions from your lightening channel?  Also saying Alice isn't like a Bank because there are other options is like say a bank isn't a bank because you can always use a different bank.  The title of the Bitcoin paper is, "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" Lightening takes out the peer to peer part and makes it into a hub a spoke topology[0] which is essentially what modern banking is.
The over arching problem I have though isn't that people want to implement Lightening.  It's that they want to choke the original peer-to-peer part of Bitcoin by being intensely stubborn about increasing traditional block space.
[0] The FAQ calls it a mesh but it is pretty clear that the intent is for some lightening nodes to have channels open with a large number of participants which would make them centralized hubs.

Look we know Bitcoin as is _works_ and we know the creator thought the right way to scale was to increase the block size and hard forks.  Your argument seems to come down to hand waving that all of a sudden what has worked will stop working, Bitcoins creator was wrong and even though people have concerns about this new way they are unfounded because you said so and religious devotion to your 'team'.
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:29:18
I think it's a bit of revisionist history.  According to the HK agreement there was supposed to be a 2mb HF for on chain scaling to be activated at the same time as SW and then they did a bait and switch and started marketing SW as a scaling solution even though it really isn't.
People aren't opposing SW for political reasons they are opposing it because they think soft forks are bad / dangerous and SW is a cludge that would be much cleaner as a hard fork.

Why do we have to choose one over the other though? Why not let all models grow and compete and let the market participants choose.  That is the main issue I have with this, it is being implemented in a way that very much will harm the original peer-to-peer system that has been so successful to this point.

Gemini seems fine for the bit I've used it but to say the fees are lower than Coinbase/GDAX is not true.  GDAX's lowest fee tier is 0% when you place a market making limit order.  Gemini charges a fee for all orders no matter the type.
You also seem to be confusing Coinbases wallet brokerage account with the exchange service that Gemini provides which is more a direct competitor to GDAX.

Do you really think that there is no relationship between the number of users and the number of transactions?  That just can't be. Bitcoin isn't growing because the same 1,000 people are just doing more transactions.  It's like saying Internet traffic is unrelated to the number of people using it.

Doesn't it put casual users in a tough spot because it doesn't fully validate the new style transactions if they don't upgrade?  They are still at risk of financial loss only in a soft fork situation it is more of a silent failure and in a hard fork their client will at least tell them there is a problem before they get in too deep.

Fiat, or some form of local national currencies will probably always exist.  Perhaps each nation even creates their own block-chain style currency but Bitcoin will always be the backbone that ties everything together.  At least that is how I see it working out.
@_date: 2017-01-07 13:43:06
Raising the block size does not increase centralization.  Centralization is caused by limiting user growth.  Look at any industry that hits a period of low or no growth. what happens?  Companies in the industry start to consolidate aka centralize.  The best thing we can do to keep Bitcoin decentralized if to grow the user base and keep growing it.  To do that we need a bigger block size than one MB.

Is there a description for how to use the command line to do it and by command line do you mean the Python interface?
@_date: 2017-01-08 13:29:41
peer-to-peer means you interact directly with the person you want to do business with.  This describes you as interacting with a middle man or sequence of middle men to make the payment.  That isn't peer to peer the Lightening white paper even describes it as "Hub-and-spoke"
The FAQ says users who can't continuously monitor the blockchain themselves will have to outsource to a service.  That is the definition of centralization if everyone is using a few service providers.
2+MB?  I think you missed something because it's really 1MB for traditional peer-to-peer transactions plus slightly less than 1MB for these new segwit transactions and it comes out to slightly less than two not 2+
You're right about one thing I was mistaken it isn't a 4x discount.  It's only 75% discount because they only count 1 in 4 of the bytes of a segwit transaction.  
@_date: 2017-01-08 14:04:12
Currently it looks like about 15% of the miners are running an implementation that won't ever signal support for segwit.  Since it requires 95% support to activate unless something changes it isn't going to activate as is.  There is also only about 25% of miners who are mining segwit blocks so you have a large swath of miners (60%) that haven't moved either way yet.  We know at least some of that 60% is unhappy with segwit as is based on things they have tweeted.
The parties are going to have to get together and hash out a real compromise.

If you looked at the bip for FT the second link explicitly says "Hard Fork" I'm not sure how much more up front about it than that you can be.

Ok, that's where I thought this was leading thanks for getting to the point.  So you are saying that core developer's analysis of their own work is unbiased and the the flexible transaction developers analysis of his own work is one sided?  Seems like a double standard.  
You also think that endorsements from a bunch Bitcion related companies somehow relates to software quality.  I guess if I weren't an engineer and couldn't decide for myself I could see where that sort of thing might be appealing.

Have you read the lightening white paper instead of just repeating stuff others have told you?  It specifically uses the term "hub and spoke" to describe it's architecture.  People started calling it a "mesh" because someone pointed out that hub and spoke is pretty much what the current banking system is.
Your argument essentially boils down to semantics.  Someone points to a potato and you say that's not a potato that's a tuber!  It's not a hub-and-spoke it's a mesh.  It's not a bank it's a node in the mesh that just happens to have an LN channel open with a large number of people.
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:05:19
It sounds like it encourages people you put trust in a few centralized providers of Lightening services while also weakening the core network's security by taking away transaction fees that would have gone to miners.  I wouldn't have a problem with it if the same people pushing Lightening weren't also choking efforts to increase block space for traditional transactions.
@_date: 2017-01-07 15:30:56
"It [Lightning] will become a decentralized network"
How does lightening have anything to do with decentralization?  It's a transaction between you and a counter party and you have to constantly monitor the Bitcoin network to make sure your counter party isn't cheating you.  The FAQ says you can outsource this to a centralized service.
I personally wouldn't care if this gets implemented if it weren't for the fact that the parties pushing this are choking the traditional block space while at the same time giving the transaction space that enables lightning a 4x fee discount.
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:59:37
Ideas and actions don't come from nowhere.  You are conflating not liking actions with having a problem with people.  But back the more important discussion.  The Lightening Network paper uses the term "Hub-and-Spoke" it doesn't even say "mesh" in it's description.
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:20:27
Did you read the github post I linked above it explains pretty clearly why it is a cleaner solution than segwit?  I'm not sure I can do any better than that.  Here are some additional links that might help you understand...

I believe it has strong support among people who oppose segwit.  whether or not people who support segwit will compromise to get the benefits of segwit implemented in a way that is more acceptable to the wider community I don't know.  Segwit isn't happening as is though with 15% of the actively network opposing it and another 60% not yet taking sides so something has to change.
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:05:11
You can't just say "not true" and expect people to take that as fact.  The lightening white paper doesn't ever use the term "mesh" but it does talk about hub and spoke systems.

Your example isn't realistic.  Profit making businesses don't sell goods at a loss under normal circumstances.  Your example seems to assume that a miner will include any transaction no matter how low the fee even if it would represent a net loss for them.  The reality is there are certain fixed costs of running a mining farm.  A miner is going to take their cost to run the farm to mine a single block and divide that by the average transaction rate.  That will give them their cost per transaction.  Any transaction with a fee below that level will be discarded because it would represent a loss for them to mine it.  Just like Walmart isn't going to sell you tube socks for $2 if it cost them $3 to manufacture.  It is in every miners interest to do this and as long as enough of them do people will still have to pay a reasonable fee for a prompt confirmation and miners will make profits.

More bandwidth but the long term storage requirements are a bit less because they eventually throw out part of the transmitted data.  I agree with you that if we don one might as well do both.
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:32:29
No one is saying that they wouldn't pick a size that balanced fees vs costs.  Just like Walmart doesn't flood the market with zero cost tube socks it wouldn't be in the miners interest to flood the market with to much block space.  It would find a market equilibrium.

@_date: 2017-01-02 16:20:22
In some very specific use cases where you are extremely careful yeah it can offer more anonymity protection than a credit card.  In a common example though where you buy a product from a company with BTC.  That company will have your shipping address and if that company uses an exchange to convert their BTC to USD for example the path to tracking that transaction back to you isn't substantially different or more difficult than a credit card would be.  It doesn't really matter if your wallet reused the address or not.
If you want to be really careful with a credit card though you can buy visa gift cards for cash or something like that.  If you are looking for a perfect comparison you will be disappointed but on the whole there isn't a ton of difference in the anonymity department.
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:02:30
The only thing I would say about the first point is that hashrate share graph is becoming more fragmented than it used to be.  We used to have ghash.io which was ~50% along with a few other big players and now we have a bunch of little guys making up a huge share.
The big mining consolidation trend we saw in 2013 - 2015 has reversed for two reasons.  
1. Mining tech is more stable and evening available now so you don't have individuals with early access to hardware advances getting massive advantage over large groups running old tech.  Exclusive access to ASIC tech early on allowed the people who has it to dominate mining.
2. Rising price makes the industry more profitable and allows room for new entrants to get into the market.
I just don't see mining consolidation being a big problem going forward and I don't think it has any relation to block size.
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:02:06
If that were true then block space would have been full years ago and it is only within the past several months that we have been bumping up against the cap.  So clearly that is not true.  The size of a block a miner creates will be balanced against their cost of production and the chance that creating a too big block will get orphaned.
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:14:20
I don't think this problem is unique to hardware wallets.  You have to put trust in the code running any wallet whether it is local software, web, or hardware.

Dude, Segwit does not increase the block size that would require a hard fork and segwit is a softfork.  What it does do is change how the bytes are counted toward the 1MB and stuffs a bunch of data aka the witness data in a secondary structure which needs to be sent over the network but is later discarded.  You are pushing your political narrative to the point of disregarding actual fact.

So you don't think anyone operating a LN is going to be running a large server farm?  Because in all the descriptions here it sounds like Alice is a large entity with many channels open ot many people.  Yes, payment channels were discussed by SN but in the context of needing to do faster transactions than the 10 minute block limit could facilitate not in place of the peer-to-peer part of the system.
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:55:21

Your point of view is extremely idealistic and naive.  The reality is that anyone skilled enough and motivated enough to review source for back doors can also review the compiled binary code.  Both are tedious tasks requiring experience and skill.  It's just as easy for a serious software flaw to hide in open source code as it is for it to hide in closed source.  There have been a number of high profile security compromising bugs in prominent opensource packages in recent years that were in the code for _years_ before being discovered and fixed.  Whether they got there by accident of on purpose the result was the same.
Your software wallet is going to be running on something.  That something is probably an Intel CPU in your PC or some ARM chip in your phone.  Intel CPU's for sure have closed source micro code.  Microcontrollers like you find in a hardware wallet usually don't have micro code.  They do have firmware though and because of the less complex nature of a micro controller that firmware is often easier to review than the full software stack of a modern PC or Phone.

Transaction fees are based on the number of bytes of block space used not the value transferred.  There is little to no correlation between the amount of value being transferred and the transaction fee.
Edit: You edited your comment it originally said, "Yes. If total value transacted per day increases, so will each fee per transaction i would argue which makes total transaction fees per day a relevant metric."  which is wrong.
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:39:36
No, if transaction rate tops out then the only place left for growth is in total value transacted.  In other words each transaction needs to be for a larger amount.  It would be best for everyone though if the block size were increased so we can grow both transactions and total transaction value.

I didn't say there wasn't.  I'm talking about where growth will once transaction volume reaches the block size limit and can no longer grow if the block size isn't raised.  In that situation the only way to grow is through increasing per transaction value.
The transaction fee is a separate thing.

The only astounding thing is how you are conflating block-space with the value transferred in a transaction.
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:17:58
You just described a scenario where people reduce the number of transactions they need to use to transfer the same value.  That reduces demand for block space and like you said transaction fees are a function of block space supply and demand.
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:54:33
You clearly are.  You literally claimed that the total value transferred is a proxy for transaction fees.  It clearly isn't.  Fees are a function of transaction size in bytes based on current market prices for block space.

I'm curious if you are actually experienced in hardware design and manufacturing?  I ask because I see a lot of inexperienced people on the Internet spout of opinions like yours that this or that should only be 50 cents blah blah blah and they have no concept of the reality of electronics manufacturing costs.  My guess is that the Trezor is still a relatively _low_ volume product on the order of being manufactured in batches of 1,000 compared to more commonly used electronics which are manufactured in batches of 10k, 100k, or 1 million at a time.  low volume means much higher component and manufacturing costs and comments like yours that imply they are some how milking customers at their $99 price point are just uninformed.  They are in all likely hood not making much money on their new price point in order to try and get volume up to a point where the manufacturing costs are lower.

This article leaves out some important facts.  The gold that is being "repatriated" from New York belongs to the Texas University systems endowment.  They own gold as part of their investments as any large investment fund would.  They are likely paying storage fees on that gold right now so the state of Texas is going to give them free storage via this new law and in essence increasing public university funding by saving them the storage costs.  At the same time the state is entering into what was the domain of a private business ie: gold storage.  Of course they are selling it to their citizens based on a subliminal "Obama's going to take your guns and gold campaign" since people in Texas are paranoid as heck despite facts to the contrary.  This is just a roundabout way of increasing their public university funding.  I bet Democrats are having a good laugh at them for being so easily manipulated.

Not necessarily _all_ miners but if enough do it it would have the same effect.  It's also possible that they forms policies like certain fee levels that are too low only get included after sitting in the mempool for a few blocks.  I don't understand why you seem to think that scenario is ridiculous.  Look at any company that sells a product where the marginal cost of producing an additional unit for sale is zero they still have a minimum price they charge they don't just give their product away at any price a customer offers.

Both 'safe' and 'safety' are correct terms and generally used interchangeably for the same thing.  
People with large amounts of money already don't use banks for storing cash short term.  They keep their cash in US Treasury Bills because they are viewed as safer than putting cash in a bank for amounts over the FDIC insurance limit.  Interest rates on Treasuries have already gone negative and there was no massive panic.

It's late in the game now but as soon as MtGox started having issues earlier this year first with Dwolla and then other transfer methods I immediately converted all my cash to BTC and transferred it to coinbase which for me as a US citizen has the benefit of being both US based and more on the up and up with applicable financial laws.
At the time the price spread between the two was negligible but now it is around $20 which appears to be the premium for the risk that having money in MtGox and trying to run the wire transfer gauntlet poses.

The reason is, most of the BTC mining "profit" calculators out there have wildly optimistic defaults for the rate at which difficulty will increase if they take it into account at all.  I think what is happening is that people new to the mining scene are using these calculators w/o realizing this and end up making bad decisions.  Go Google for, "bitcoin mining profit calculator" and take a look at the 7 results on the first page.  All but one,  would lead you to believe that buying a miner is profitable.
1. bitcoinx - "Profitability decline per year" defaults to .61 it should be more like .000008
2. Alloscomp - Doesn't take difficulty increases or even power costs into account at all
3. blockchained.com - "decline per year" defaults to .63 should be closer to .000008
4. btcinvest - This is the first calculator in the results that appears to actually show that mining is not currently profitable using the defaults for difficulty.
5. bitclockers.com - the default difficulty % change per month is set to 2% in reality it is more like 50%+
6. dustcoin.com - doesn't account for future changes in difficulty.
7. coinish.com - has reasonable defualts for difficulty increases but doesn't actually include them in the ROI calculation unless you switch to "Expert" mode which isn't the default.

The "BTC reached gold price parity" meme is BS.  Prices matching doesn't mean something is at "parity".  Parity between BTC and gold would be if the prices were equal when controlled for supply.  In BTC's case the eventual supply will be 21 million coins we are at about half that right now.  Gold on the other hand has a total supply in existence of about 170,000 tons which is roughly 5 billion troy ounces.  In other words for every Bitcoin that will eventually exist there currently exists roughly 238 ounces of gold so in my book price parity will be when BTC is in the neighborhood of $285,000 per coin assuming a gold price of roughly $1200 per ounce.

Another way to think about it is that; the way BitCoin mining works by design the thing that really matters is not your absolute hashing power but your hashing power relative to the total hashing power in the world. So even if they lowered prices that would just serve to increase demand even more, causing the total hashing power to go up faster, making it even harder to turn a profit regardless of the price of the mining hardware.

"I also have a feeling that whatever problems Mt. Gox is facing, other exchanges will face sooner or later as well. This is an important time for Bitcoin."
I don't think you can look at Mt.Gox's problems and assume they will befall other exchanges.  It's become apparent that Mt.Gox was playing fast and loose when it came to following banking regulations.  This was evidenced in the closing of their Dwolla account and seizure of their bank account.  Other exchanges like coinbase don't seem to be making that mistake and will likly not encounter the same difficulties as Mt.Gox so long as they do.

This is just the latest in a list of reasons not to use MtGox if you are a US based customer.  For me the negatives are...
1. Dwolla account frozen so there is no cheap or simple way to move money in and out of MtGox.
2. Mt.Gox is based in Japan so if you are a US citizen with over a certain amount of money in MtGox you will probably have to fill out a FBAR form or face potential large fines.
3. Shutting down USD withdrawals.  I don't believe them for one minute when they say it is only temporary.  When their Dwolla account got shut down they said they were going to look into what happened and update everyone in a couple weeks when they knew more and that was over a month ago.

Looks like there are a number of new exchanges coming online for US customers.  Should be interesting to see which ones become viable.  By my count US residents have the following options if they don't want to deal with international wire transfers and foreign financial accounts to get into bitstamp and mtgox
CoinBase - by and large the clear winner at the moment but isn't really an exchange in the true sense.  They have cheap and easy bank transfers via ACH and dead simple identity verification in their favor
CoinMkt - Has the benefit of letting you trade several different coins in addition to btc.  Market seems kind of low volume. They have automated identity verification but their deposit options are currently limited to shady internet services that charge several % or money orders.
CampBX - Hard to say how popular they are.  Identity verification is still a manual process, they were supposed to launch an automated system in early Nov. but it didn't happen.  Once you are verified there are decent low cost ways to get money in and out.  I'm surprised this one isn't more popular.
CoinSetter - not open for trading except for perhaps a few beta customers.  Unknown what their identity verification process will be like or what transfer options there will be.
CoinX - not open for trading except for perhaps beta customers.  Unknown what their identity verification process will be like or what transfer options there will be.
I think the US market is wide open for a true exchange to complement CoinBase.  No one has gotten the killer combination yet of a healthy market combined with easy identity verification and low cost transfers

I suspect you problem stems from the fact that you tried to buy the maximum immediately after opening a new account.  Part of the process of verification for a CoinBase account is buying some bitcoin and holding it for 30 days.  When I opened my account I bought the minimum allowed, like $20, and let it sit for thirty days.  Since then I've done many buys and never had any problems.
If you have ever dealt with any other exchange you would realize that CoinBase really is better esp. for US residents.  Originally when I got involved in BitCoin earlier this year I had to wait in excess of 30 days for Mt.Gox to verify my identity before they would let me do anything.  Then the BS started when it became clear that Mt.Gox wasn't even making a legitimate attempt to comply with US banking laws and the fact that because they are based in Japan if you hold more than 10k with them you have to fill out extra forms at tax time simply because you hold money in a foreign account.  BitStamp though nicer than Mt.Gox in many respects has the same problem of being a foreign exchange.
The bottom line is you can't expect to sit on the side lines for months on end and then expect you should be able to open an account and make a huge purchase immediately at your whim.  You should have been starting the account opening process and verification months ago if you thought you would want to buy bitcoin at some point.  Maybe some day all of this will happen seamlessly and immediately but things just aren't there yet.

transfer them to another exchange.  The best thing to do is choose one in your own country so it is easier to get the money out when you want to sell.  If you are in the US Coinbase is a good option.  Bitstamp also seems like they have there stuff together though they are based in the UK.  There are other exchanges within the US like CoinMKT and CampBX as well.

Did you factor in that your mining profits will be reduced by roughly 30% every 10 days?  If not 4 months is an eternity and you will loose money at those prices.  
Use the bitcoinx calculator  with the profitability decline per year set to 0.000008 (you get that number by using this  and assuming that difficulty will continue to rise at roughly 30% as it has for the past several months.
Using reasonable estimates for difficulty if you could plug that miner in this moment and start mining I personally wouldn't pay more than 800USD for it.

I think you guys all have the wrong expectations of CoinBase.  They are are not meant to be a realtime trading exchange.  If you want to buy and sell quickly to take advantage of price movements in the market you should be using Bitstamp/campBX/MtGox.

There are a lot of people that work for the government.  The likely hood that at least one person involved realizes that having control of a lot of coins gives the government a lot of leverage is *high*. On the other hand the likely hood that the US Government or significant sub organization as a whole understands the implications of their position in a way that would translate into a broader action or policy is very very small at this point.

It will certainly make people more careful about what they spend their money on which is the opposite of the situation we have today where you can get 0% interest rate loans so why not spend as much as humanly possible.

If anyone is considering selling Bitcoin via eBay for payment via PayPal you would have to be insane.  As it stands the buyer can just dispute the transaction and paypal will reverse it.

Unless paypal changes their policies to cater specifically to digital currency like taking a transaction hash on the bitcoin network as proof of a legit sale then the risk is not worth any price.

You realize this is the exact reason that CoinBase had to scale back their instant buy feature.  Because people like you that can't be bothered to keep track of their bank balance.

You can't wait until tax season (April 15th) to pay taxes in a situation like that you will owe late penalties if you do.  Taxes are actually due in quarterly payments most of us don't have to deal with that though because our taxes are paid regularly out of our paycheck if you have a normal job.

Wikipedia is in a sense an entrenched institution that is controlled by its editors.  What is taken as obvious fact and what needs to be cited is largely a function of their own paradigms.  The one thing they hold above all else is a cited fact from a reliable new source.  Hence if you want to over come the standard paradigm you need to cite a source even if it seems obvious to one self.  There was never any cited source to show that the same things that make such a passage irrelevant for the USD are not also true for BTC it was just taken as fact in so far as I can tell.

No, they are probably the best one out there.  They seem to take all the relevant parameters into account and use reasonable defaults for expected difficulty increases.  
From the standpoint of a newcomer though; you probably wouldn't know about their calculator or realize why it was better unless you've been in on the scene for a little while because it doesn't show up in Google results as often as the others and you need to use terms that are part of the bitcoin culture for it to show up in search results.
For the genesisblock calculator to be in the first page of Google results of someone searching for a mining profit calculator it looks like they would have to use the term "ROI" somewhere in the search.  ROI isn't an obvious thing to search for until you've been around for a while and see other people using it most people are going to search for "bitcoin mining calculator" or "Bitcoing profit calculator"  Even when you add in ROI as a search term genisisblock only shows up as the ~4th result.

@_date: 2013-10-15 12:05:15
Yes.  In the sense that you might have made more by just buying bitcoin.  In order for mining to be 'profitable' in the truest sense of the word you need to be able to mine back any bit coins you paid for your hardware plus some.
For example if you buy a ASIC miner for 10 BTC when the exchange rate is 100 USD/BTC and you manage to mine back only 5 of those BTC and the exchange rate is now 1000 you will have 5x the cash in USD terms but you only have half the bit coin if you had just bought and held those 10 BTC you would have made more money.

You can probably break even if you sell them on localbitcoins.com there is usually a premium there.  As soon as I saw the Dwolla shut down I saw the writing on the wall and moved my coins.  My guess is the spread will only get worse until there is a run on the exchange.

You can only sign addresses for which you have control of the private key so if you set your btc public address (aka: the address where dividends would be paid) to a CoinBase or similar 'web wallet' sevice you will first need to change it to an address which you can sign with.
The easiest thing to do is probably to use one of the "Software Wallets" listed on bitcoin.org 
MultiBit has worked the best for me in the past but you can also use BitCoin-qt.  I have no experience with Armory.  install your client of choice create a new wallet password protect it etc... 
Next in Multi-bit create a new address by going to the "Request" tab and click the "New" button.  Set that new address as your public address in bitfunder.  
Next sign a message with that address.  In the Multi-bit client the "sign message" feature is under the Tools menu you put in the public address you want to sign with and the message you want to sign, click sign and the "signature" is what you need to seed to who ever to verify you are you you are.
Before you do this be careful your computer isn't infected with viruses and crap.  If you are the kind of person that likes to download random shit from Facebook and clicks on every link people send you or someone who does that also shares the computer with you then burn your computer go to the store and buy a new one before doing the above.

No matter if there is one person mining or one billion Bitcoins are still created at the same rate so the supply isn't effected by miners. The fact that people get their coins through mining them or buying them shouldn't matter to the supply demand equation.
