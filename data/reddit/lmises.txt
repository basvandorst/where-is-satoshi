Yeah, I don't understand that at all. Electrum? HORRIBLY OFF TOPIC GET THE FUCK OUT. Random mises.org link? Come on in and enjoy the karma train!

Yeah, it's pretty clear you aren't blaming USMS for the cyber-attack, you're just saying they caused it to happen. Wait. What?

So did you actually confirm that they used any of your advice before letting them put your name on the advisory board?

It's just very suspicious to me that this breaking point happened to coincide with a scam that theymos' other forum was implicated in. This is a very troubling turn for in my opinion.

Judging by the number of colossal blockchain.info fuck ups recently, probably by shirking his duties there.

Then why does KiA have a special name for her like she's Voldemort?

If you don't want to hold people in the bitcoin community responsible for their actions, that's on you. There is too much money on the line for me to be willing to just brush things like this under the rug. If you want bitcoin to survive the transition to the mainstream we need to hold ourselves to a higher standard than this. I would be fired from my job if I allowed something half as egregious as this. So should he.

It doesn't seem that the mods here typically delete off topic or disruptive threads. Why was this different? Were theymos' jimmies a little too rustled at this one?

Please stop spreading FUD. The invisible hand will fix everything in the future.

Except he didn't verify that they hold all of their coins. He picked one cold wallet at random and verified they controlled that cold wallet then inferred that they controlled all of their cold wallets.

Whatever happened to Atlas?

I can't decide if my favorite part of this is the sexism or the unironic use of the word statist. The whole thing is in serious Poe's law territory.

Maybe he can give them the high level technical advice not to allow an unverified party to reset a charity's 2FA and then log in from a Tor exit node to steal all of said charity's funds.

Honest question: why do people always post this shit as a youtube video? Maybe I'm just old but it seems like a significantly worse medium for conveying an intelligent point than writing an article.

What a professional mod we have here! Having you at helm will surely do wonders for this community.

Bitcoin: a currency that doesn't see race unless you're a Roma and then of course it's casual racism as usual.

Although he was contrite today he handled the whole situation so poorly that it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. He was really unprofessional to myself and several other users.
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:05:11
Does that same conflict of interest not apply to Theymos when his shady behavior around the pirate ponzi gets exposed? Or since you were acting as his lacky does it not count?

Piping a curl'ed url into sudo bash seems like one of the worst ways to install anything. 
It blows my mind that people who pretend to care about crypto/security would do that.
