How safe is buying bitcoins in person? I figure the person you bought it from surely would be able to make a backup of the data/keys he sends you? What would I do to ensure that this doesn't happen, or to feel safer?

OK, I think I'm close here...
So wallets are 'account managers' or interfaces, essentially, and they handle the private key for me for each transaction? Or do I need to somehow authenticate manually when I want to send money? 
Lets say I don't want to use a wallet. Is that an option? Is there a very basic way that I can say empty the contents of one address into another address by manually inputting the public and private keys to authenticate? I assume that's what these nicer user friendly wallets are doing, right?
Lastly (thank you very much by the way!), what happens if I just lose or forget the public and private adress/keys. Is that Btc lost forever, like real money would be, I suppose?

Thank you very much, this has been very informative!

I think so. So what I'm understanding is that my wallet consists of a bunch of public addresses that I can give out to people to send money. They don't identify me necessarily, but they contain a certain value of Btc. A wallet, then, is just a collection of these addresses (or "accounts" if you will)? You can use a new address each time you want to make a transaction, or you can use the same. 
Now I understand that each public address comes with a corresponding private address, is this correct? And that private address is used how?

I absolutely have a very rough understanding of the process. Thank you.
