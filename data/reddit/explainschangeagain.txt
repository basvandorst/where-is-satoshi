identity protection is incumbent on the user. Uninformed users can't assume that they are anonymous

you don't download wallets.    
I'm going to now assume that you are really a new user. So, here's some advice: learn more. As a new user, you are going to make mistakes. They will be costly mistakes if you don't understand what's going on.    
An address is a pair of numbers: a private key+a public key.    
A wallet is a bunch of addresses.    
If you don't understand what's going on underneath the surface you are going to lose all of your coins to a change address. mark my words

you're uninformed.   
I didn't lose money to an address bug. Years ago(!) I lost money when i transferred out of a cold wallet and forgot about change addresses. User error. Hundreds of bitcoins lost into the blockchain forever.    
So, smartypants, how dare you lecture me about the intricacies of the key pairing?? huh? You don't know what a koblitz curve is and you think you have a faint idea about how bitcoin works? good luck

I may be an asshole, but I also have experience losing btc. I'm not trying to discourage anyone, but I'm sick of stupid doge enthusiasm.    
This is real money, and misinformed people are losing it everyday.    
Since you are so well informed, why do you think satoshi chose Koblitz curves? I have a theory, but I'm interested to hear your opinion!

you downloaded your first wallet? Maybe you need to read more, you obvious fraud. It's one thing to post positive things about bitcoin, it's another when you are fabricating (obviously). You may appeal to stupid people, but you insult most of us
