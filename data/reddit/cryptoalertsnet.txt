Hi allyougottado,
Consolidation lead to a very nice short squeeze (06.11.14 16:00GMT @ BitcoinWisdom).
1st long target @ $348 has been reached.
Report: 
The next 8-12 hours will be critical. It needs to be seen whether this breakout is followed with a throwback.
Currently indicators have entered overbought territory.

Hi, allyougottado
Price needs to break the $342-$344 resistance area with conviction. 
The first week of November is almost upon us and still no significant rally has been accomplished.

Price is the only leading indicator and common denominator.
All other indicators are "lagging indicators".
However, in order to produce a quality technical analysis a combination of factors is required. If you want predictions use a crystal ball.
With regards to fundamental and quantitative analysis, please provide an example of your model to support your thesis examining where price is right now and estimating where it should be and why.
Maybe you could apply Stochastic Calculus to get some viable results. But all depends on the data you will use.
Also note that the application of quantitative analysis to finance begun in the early 1900's.

Thank you for your comment.
This is just a quick market snapshot.
Moreover, your erroneous reference to "that many support and resistance levels" + "1980" is actually mocking one of the most popular tools for technical analysis.
These levels are the "Fibonacci Retracement Levels". 
You can learn more about them here: 
Also we would be glad if you could provide a "better" and more "modern" approach to support any of your thesis.
Finally, we don's see how "Elliot wave" analysis relates to our post.

Overnight price action has triggered our long setup above $377.
It has produced a beautiful and steady rally. 
Next possible target $410 is getting close. If reached, models will be updated.

Sorry zombiecoiner,

Dear yoshiosikun,
Your suggestion seems viable.
Apparently the community provides better explanations than Bitstamp itself.
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:02:31
Yes, he is an active trader.
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:11:23
Actively trading on Bitfinex, OKCoin and Bitstamp for that reason.

Nice conclusion!
At which point in our post do we state any short/long entry?
FWI this is a re-post because a fellow user was kind enough to point out an important spelling mistake that was made in the "hours old postings"
Best Regards!
