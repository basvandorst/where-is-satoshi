Because when people try to shift the discussion based on shit that wasn't actually said, it creates dishonest dialogue. If we want to have any kind of realistic discussion, then manipulative shit like this shouldn't be tolerated. 


It's important, but it's NOT part of his post. He's arguing that people are treating bitcoin as a speculative investment, instead of as a currency. How people are finding out about it isn't essential to that argument. It can be a part of that argument, but it doesn't have to be, and he didn't use how people were finding out about it as even a small part of his argument. You trying to turn it around and respond to something he didn't say as if it was the core of his argument is disingenuous.
It can still be a worthwhile discussion, but it's not the one he was having.


Nah. Let's try to figure out what is most likely to happen. Can't make well-informed decisions without doing that first.

That is not what the post was saying. He did not say media, television, cable, or anything implying that. He said "mainstream attention". In context, that is extremely unlikely to mean cable news or something like it, because nothing else in the post was even slightly about that.
It just means that people who aren't normally into the cryptocurrency scene are hearing about it, and are buying it because they see the value ballooning. That is what is making it a bubble. The exact way that they're hearing about it isn't part of the post at all.
