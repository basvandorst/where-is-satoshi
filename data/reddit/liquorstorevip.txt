@_date: 2017-02-07 18:37:45
sure fine i somewhat agree - now tell me why it is important for every mom and pop to run a node
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:23:37
the worship of core/blockstream is worse.  they have incentives beyond seeing the value of their bitcoins grow.  that is the red flag that we need to be wary of.
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:34:14
The market is in the process of deciding the best way to scale bitcoin.  Previously, core positioned segwit as the right solution, but the market (i.e. the miners) are increasingly in favor of BU hard fork.  This is currently seen as the leading proposal for scaling bitcoin.  Once momentum builds for BU or any other proposal, it will eventually hit critical mass and the stalemate will be over.  
Nodes with any kind of financial stake in bitcoin will follow the winning proposal to maximize their return.  
We need to find a solution to scaling and the market is telling us BU is the best solution out there right now.
I believe it is Core that is telling us to trust them.  The market is saying no.
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:56:28
Valid point, this is a risk.  However the risk of SW/LN/offchain seems greater.  At least, from a technical layperson's point of view, BU is a simpler solution that creates less technical debt.  
My concern with Core's proposal is it has a greater risk of impacting the incentive structure of miners.  If we mess that up, we could really break things.
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:35:50
There are experts on both sides and I side with the experts who don't have funding from banks and desire for undue long term control over the project.
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:16:00
Agreed I think we just differ slightly on how we define decentralized 
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:56:40
This is what we are dealing with.  If the segwit proposal was superior, would they need to stifle dissent so heavily??
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:00:22
The markets perception of the technical merits of segwit is as important as the actual technical merits.  I am telling you that the market perceives too much uncertainty and risk with segwit.  The hash rate confirms this
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:42:40
There is, never was, never was meant to be an economic incentive for every user to run a node.  And this does not equate to 'centralization'.  Mining is way more decentralized than it used to be (e.g. 15% largest pool vs ~50% in years past).  Miners have an incentive to increase users and price of bitcoin, they are not short sighted.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:31:02
There is no economic incentive to run a node so it is not as important as what miners signal with hashing
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:21:19
Core's proposals go against Satoshi's vision.  The miners are finally figuring this out.  Stay with corecoinz if you want, but the miners may not follow you.  And the money will follow the miners.
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:04:13
I agree with that point.  But I place faith in satoshis intentions over blockstream/core blind loyalty.  Not sure that goes for everyone around here
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:24:56
If BU had no merit you wouldn't be crying from the rooftops about evil Roger.  Strawman bullshit
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:26:53
Right, and they won't do that.  The community (miners, others outside this subreddit) wants larger on chain blocks.  
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:37:55
tell me how those two things are not the same
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:17:21
Transfer scalability to layer two and you shift the power structure and possibly kill bitcoin.  Satoshi envisioned a world of greater resource abundance, and incentives for certain groups to procure those resources to mine and support bitcoin.  Not everyone with a node.  Even with larger block resource requirements, you keep the incentive structure intact.  We need to keep it onchain to maintain all this.
@_date: 2017-02-06 03:36:21
Satoshi said it actually.  
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:20:39
Can't shift scalability off chain.  That will damage the power and incentive structure that brought us to this point.  I agree we haven't hit max pain on this issue yet
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:38:36
Cool, I'm just one guy on reddit.  I'm not a shill buying myself reddit gold.  Gimme a break
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:37:21
We will take the miners with us
@_date: 2017-02-05 09:39:59
how is that relevant?  i trust the hash power (i.e. the market) because the hash power has the economic incentive to see bitcoin grow successfully 
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:43:37
The miners will follow the money and I will follow them
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:19:34
The miners pay for hash power, so by extension the miners determine the winner.  This seems like simple logic.  
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:31:51
Fine for now I agree...

Further entrench Blockstream into the ecosystem when they have outside investment from banks, that makes the market question their true motivations.  Markets hate uncertainty 
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:48:33
In this bitcoin world, I mainly trust those with a direct incentive to see bitcoin succeed, i.e. miners.  Blockstream and even those others you mention have outside money and influence that may skew their incentives around bitcoin growth
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:29:52
I'm looking at the big economic picture not the technical nuances.  The market isn't comfortable with segwit.  We need to find an alternative 
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:00:06
yes we could compare it to pixey dust or unicorn farts, i suppose
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:43:31

@_date: 2017-02-07 17:41:23
Core doesn't understand the economic issues of their proposals.  That's the problem.  The miners, who have the principal economic incentives in this system, are starting to realize this.  
@_date: 2017-02-06 03:38:20

I'm in bitcoin because it hasn't been corrupted by banks yet.   The more faith we place in blockstream the closer we are to corruption from interests that don't care if bitcoin appreciates in value

me too.  i feel some healthy paranoia is prudent when there is this much at stake
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:51:02
Oh big whoop about this one block.  Core has screwed up worse before, and the world didn't end then either.  How much money are we losing everyday in unnecessary tx fees and unconfirmed tx.  This is a deterrent to new users and use cases.  
@_date: 2017-02-04 22:58:58
The price started going up in parallel to BU blocks/hashing/nodes going up.  SW is losing steam.
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:15:17
I believe this is called, 'put your money where your mouth is.'  Too bad all Core has is a loud mouth.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:24:29
i have to because core/blockstream twisted his words and vision for bitcoin - we can't trust them because they have outside influence giving them incentives beyond just seeing bitcoin go up in value
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:02:28
my point is the miners are not adopting segwit because of the perceived risk it creates.  idk if BU is the right solution but it is  right now
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:00:48
Everyone on want SW yes, but what matters is the miners and how they vote with their hashing.
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:29:11
thanks for disclosing you work for blockstream :/
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:42:54
That's your opinion.  And different opinions make a market.  We will eventually see which path is taken.
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:01:21
Ur paranoid
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:38:20
satoshi didn't predict a toxic core dev team who would twist his words to maintain their power
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:02:27
Bitcoin is all about economic incentives.  Not the opinions of a few nerds.  Miners run bitcoin not Core.
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:05:10
Only the paranoid survive 
@_date: 2017-02-28 21:10:19
That's how the system works dude what did you think you signed up for
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:08:52
upside is massive, but market cap is already 17bn.  i don't see how 100bn is possible without figuring out scaling first.
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:54:32
the good that will come of this is removing blockstream's influence
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:22:47
bitcoin's future is as much economic as it is technical.  segwit seems overly complex and could disrupt the incentives that miners have to grow the network.  if i feel this way, others (including miners) feel this way.  MARKETS HATE UNCERTAINTY and segwit's successful deployment is uncertain!
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:00:55
Bitfury and blockstream have same investors and are the main ones pushing segwit
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:31:42
agreed, core put segwit up for a vote and miners aren't going for it.  we need to find another scaling solution.  imo one that doesn't have so much uncertainty and risk of changing the miners' incentive structure that has got us to wehre we are today
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:24:38
same difference
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:43:38
and without miners strengthening the network with hash power, making bitcoin more resilient to attack, the value of a bitcoin would be significantly less.  hash power is the only vote that matters.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:37:31

@_date: 2017-02-08 04:13:16
That is a true statement.

I'm trying to make money not win an argument bro 
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:19:09
Hell no that's why we need to stir it up and find a direction 
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:53:48
if the hash power wants to hard fork we need to respect that sir
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:41:56
And there is doubt that segwit is the safest path.  I'm looking for alternatives
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:28:48
Yes really.  I believe hash power is more important anyway and nodes will follow, but yea more BU nodes have been coming online
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:30:06
Yes I did.  He is speculating about the future of bitcoin and was correct that people would be freaking out about everyone running a node.  I guess you read what you want to read into things sometimes.
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:59:40
there is no way to take a vote of the community, but if you do want to measure it in nodes (not hash power, which I still don't understand why), BU nodes are increasing as is hash power.
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:56:16
the community IS the miners - what other way are you measuring the community's decision?!??!!?!?
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:58:12
Miners vote with their hash power.  They make the rules for bitcoin.  They benefit when bitcoin is healthy and growing.  They recognize SegWit is not the way to keep bitcoin healthy.  Hence more hash power is going behind BU and less behind SegWit.  
This forum listens to nerds with a microphone.  That's not what will ultimately drive the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:39:54
I won't speak to the technical complexities although they exist.  I see the biggest risk here as an unexpected or unquantifiable change to the economic incentives.  After there are no more bitcoin to be mined, Satoshi envisioned miners continuing to mine due to the transaction fees they could get.  I fear segwit and lightning networks don't acknowledge this risk to long term incentive structure that is paramount to stability and security of the network.
@_date: 2017-02-06 03:37:10
The hash power will dictate the winner 
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:36:11
I'm fine with payment services to scale bitcoin but it doesn't need to be part of the code.  We can get by fine (capacity vs fees) in the medium to long term with bigger blocks on chain 
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:50:03
And it will be hilarious to see how this subreddit reacts when miners reject SW and fork
@_date: 2017-02-22 04:26:45

@_date: 2017-02-23 21:24:50

SW = centralization by Blockstream and its investors
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:02:40
I'm simplifying.  Obviously the miners will go with what makes them the most money.  And I will also follow the money.  
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:30:50
I believe they are risky.  I believe we can find equilibrium (tx capacity vs tx fee) with bigger blocks for the medium to long term.  I believe there is less risk in allowing bigger blocks through consensus.  
I believe third parties should create payment channels/services that are not tied into bitcoin directly.

The democratic mechanism is hash power, not trusting Core devs.  Wake up
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:40:05
I agree devs create software.  Then miners vote which software to use.  Their votes are increasingly in favor of BU (bigger blocks, no funny stuff from core/sw).  You watching coin.dance?
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:25:42
good, just follow when we fork
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:45:59
Yea only cause y'all jumped down my neck thinking you had me on a technicality 
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:22:32
segwit is too risky and leaves many questions unanswered in the long term.  it could create complexities that are hard to reverse in the future.  vs BU which is an immediate solution for the immediate block size problem, without the technical debt of segwit.
don't listen to the crap argument about hard forks.  BU is a possible future of bitcoin, not an alt coin.  read @_date: 2017-02-07 16:18:32
Downvotes for quoting the creator?  That makes sense!

if miners go to BU, everyone else will follow
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:25:27
Idk the scaling solution but I do know it won't come out of a group funded by banks.  I lump Core and blockstream together.

@_date: 2017-02-08 19:40:57
not necessarily - but we can find a good balance for quite a while with bigger blocks on chain.  payment services that enable micropayments should not be connected directly to bitcoin imo
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:26:17
you really give the miners no credit for any intelligent thought.  they have the most to gain/lose.  i trust them more than people who get outside money
@_date: 2017-02-05 08:46:54
nodes can be spun up easily, so the proportion of nodes is not as important as the proportion of mining.  nodes will switch to whatever proposal the miners follow.  blocks are full.  we need a solution for bigger blocks.  bigger blocks on chain is the simplest solution that will have the smallest economic impact.  trying to do all this segwit, ln, off chain whatever, is too uncertain.  my use of the word nerd implies that bitcoin isn't dictated by core/blockstream.  hash power dictates the future of bitcoin.  nodes will follow.
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:18:40
the miners are everything, that's what people seem to be missing - reddit and core don't matter
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:42:45
investors and miners will pick a winner.  im not convinced segwit is a winner hence let's take an honest look at alternatives
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:52:49
I've only seen this concern brushed aside.  And I wouldn't trust a group of programmers/cryptographers to be able to conduct this analysis anyway.  That's why we need to keep it onchain and keep it simple.
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:00:08
Bitcoin doesn't care what certain groups of nerds think.  All that matters is the miners and what they think.
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:57:12
Yep I hear you.  That's why BU only has 20%~ hashing right now.  I don't know that it is the panacea.  But I have seen a power grab by the segwit/core/blockstream camp, and know this is toxic to bitcoins trust less decentralized nature 
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:05:20
The market is made up of miners who contribute hash power.  Core thinks they are more important than miners but they are wrong.  I wonder what your vision of bitcoins growth is?  Place all faith in Core devs even if the miners don't agree?

bigger blocks is more certain than segwit/LN/offchain scaling.  do you disagree?  the market (bitcoin in this case) hates uncertainty

It is your opinion that that part of the community is ignorant.  We will see who wins in the end.  Whether it is BU or another proposal, I think the miners are now properly skeptical about proposals coming out of Blockstream/Core.

@_date: 2017-03-10 05:38:58
Nodes don't matter.  And that's what Core said when xt nodes were popping up so there is some hypocrisy. Look at the nodes on coin dance and you will see BU growth far exceeds Core and stands at well over 3%...
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:48:11
Grasp at straws.  Satoshi recognized that miners have the votes.  This subreddit seems to think Core is more important than the miners.
It's funny you just quoted Satoshi being completely prescient about this situation.  YOU GUYS ARE GETTING PRETTY TYRANNICAL!

ur wrong, bitcoin's formation was a technical milestone, but not without an economic vision.  if you focus only on the technical merits of a proposal, you will be left on an island with blockstream and the miners will fork away.  i hope sooner than later

The situation is coming to a head.  We are not at critical mass for any scaling proposal yet.  However the interesting and recent dynamic is that BU is gaining support and Core/SW/Blockstream is losing support. 
The dev community has its own motives and I think the market is figuring that out.  We don't want a bitcoin controlled by Core.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:05:49
guess what?  nodes don't matter.  mining matters
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:48:25
its crazy to think you have the position to threaten a pow change.  that has even less support than segwit.  nodes will follow the hash power or be left on a minority chain.

+1 for lawyer named Tittsworth
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:07:45
too bad cause hash power is the metric that matters
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:12:58
Ad hominem from sore losers continues 
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:46:49
Yes you get control over bitcoin by investing in hash power at least we agree on that 
@_date: 2017-03-21 07:36:50
No 
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:31:17
just stop talking
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:25:08
How else is bitcoin controlled in theory if not through hash power voting in self interest for bitcoin software to run?  
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:56:38
Blockstream 
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:56:34
Continuing to say a single person controls all mining pools does not make it true 
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:25:52
keep repeating your mantras, i hope they help
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:23:33
Ad hominem again gg 
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:48:13
BU is not 2MB limit, first.
again, miners have more to lose than the rest of the 'whole community' as you put it.  for my money, the miners are the whole community.
once BU gets over 51%, if it does, it will become less controversial.  it is only controversial to block stream as it threatens their power.  bitcoin recognizes block stream as the source of centralization, not miners.  that's why you are seeing this movement.
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:04:52
he doesn't work for you.  what have you contributed.  miners contribute millions to secure the network and make a small profit.  you have reddit karma, anything else?
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:26:06
Fail again
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:24:43
Yea he's the bogey man with Jihan.  Everyone here needs to wake up that hash power matters more than Reddit karma
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:21:28
explain that example if you would
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:11:54
Sore losers?
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:32:33
Where's the proof of such a grand conspiracy 
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:41:01
Gavin and miners also previously suggested similar tactics.  Good.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:18:09
Not to the coin you want.  But the money will follow the miners...
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:04:15
Surprised you didn't see peter todds tweets that are all over this subreddit and rbtc...
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:44:25
really? cause the hash rate is telling a different story....!?
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:32:18
you are going to eat your words, can't wait
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:03:56
you are so off base here.  we need the miners.  we don't need core
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:30:31
At what % hash power will you stop making this argument and go away?
So pathetic.  You wouldn't make the reverse argument I bet.  Hashpower doesn't matter unless it is Core hash power?
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:29:59
satoshi white paper yes.  how is this addressed in segwit's roadmap?  they seem to ignore the long term fee incentives that give the system security
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:07:50
Popcorn time 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:25:50
Evidence banding together jokester 
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:21:29
You are misleading with that.  BCU only has value if there is a fork this year.  BCC wins with or without segwit.  
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:22:07
Yea cause a shady exchange price and node count mean more than hash power!  Anyone scared??
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:28:48
such absolute language, how do you know it does nothing good
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:24:55
You sipped the kool aid too hard you are not worth my time
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:33:39
Coindance with the agenda lol. Can't you wake up and see that it is Core with the agenda to control bitcoin?  
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:30:29
Then you will be on an ether classic and no one cares about it
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:22:40
Its blockstream Core who had outworn their welcome and that's exactly what the hash power is saying if you listen
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:28:24
lol only fools will stand behind core once the miners leave them... certainly not the people who want bitcoin to be worth more vs less.  100+ devs wow!!!!
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:45:31
yea and all the miners are looking for a way around core's bullshit lack of roadmap, we'll see which coin the market values higher
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:30:33
dishonest is your word.  what does it refer to? the censorship on this forum in favor of core is dishonest, imo
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:17:42
You would like it this way but it is not the reality.  You lose the miners and you lose the money.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:55:45
BU is gaining consensus through hash power adoption 
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:45:00
how bout you stop drinking adam back's kool aid, stupid fucking straw man argument
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:38:02
yea and if this poll showed pow change winning y'all wouldn't be saying jack shit
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:05:38
So you want blockstream Core to have the authority to change the protocol despite overwhelming miner opposition?  How is that decentralization?
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:36:11
Wrong.  Bitcoin is nothing without miners securing the network.  Users come and go and don't have a vote unless they have hash power.  Core wants you to believe they are in control but they need the miners support
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:33:59
yep and trying to cut miners out of the picture is a pathetic last resort by core
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:43:16
Ok and when we take the hash power and investors you will come running 
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:45:01
You have concluded that miners are sabotaging.  I have concluded that miners are the most invested in bitcoin and its success.  Blockstream is most invested in controlling the narrative to maintain power.  Hash power matters, talk is cheap.  I question your assumptions.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:47:01
you guys are grasping at straws... did you check the hash rate??
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:58:06
It is insane to think that idea has a chance on the main chain, maybe as a precaution to prevent the death of a minority Core chain though 
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:26:12
all that matters is which is worth more.  you can play your theoretical game with a worthless corecoin
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:24:02
It's the main democratic mechanism of bitcoin.  Now hostile is a relative term 
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:46:58
That's not how bitcoin works 
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:42:59
good luck with that
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:51:11
Away from blockstream centralization. New pow is even less popular than segwit now don't be silly 
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:30:09
Imbeciles sure that's why miners who have invested the most into bitcoin (Reddit karma and twitter followers don't count, Core) are increasingly signaling for it instead of segwit
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:51:48
Need to educate Samson, cause the market is speaking and y'all ain't listening.  Talk is cheap.  Hash power is not.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:50:42
Because miners don't trust Core
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:29:49
Holders won't have to do anything for the most part.  Miners will protect their investments and those of holders by choosing the safest path to scale 
@_date: 2017-03-02 03:54:36
And for all intents and purposes, the miners are the users who will vote on any proposal to scale bitcoin.  There is no other feasible way to measure support 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:46:36
says you.  who are you?  i know who erik is.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:44:31
Because BCU expires worthless if there is no fork.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:24:11
cause he's not sipping core kool aid like you guys?
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:03:21
wow that's a bullshit statement.  the only reason core is in business is because miners have invested millions into this ecosystem.  don't get it twisted
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:57:10
yep, finally the truth is being translated to chinese.
marginalize the miners at your own peril, guys.  they are more important than your reddit karma, in case you didn't know.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:17:51
Do you feel like the censorship of this subreddit or the fact big banks pay the Core devs to be elements of political influence as well?
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:41:16
yea cause the two things aren't related at all :/
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:01:18
BU fans aren't worried they are laughing 
@_date: 2017-03-11 06:20:38
Cool story
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:30:53
the definition of 51% attack has changed to include miners voting for a proposal that core does not support.  be careful of the terminology.  core is being dishonest and now desperate with this pow threat.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:52:56
More dangerous than pow change no.  Y'all are only falling back on pow change because otherwise your minority chain will surely die 
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:43:24
Now they want to talk about pow changes so what, segwit can be the compromise?  Get outta here Core 
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:27:29
FUD harder next time
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:25:43
That will bankrupt you
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:38:52
brains? this idea is worse than segwit! core is desperate to cling to power!
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:04:21
Hmmm and how do you propose we measure that?  Adam Backs twitter feed?
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:46:36
Ummm have you checked outside this subreddit?? Like check the hash power...
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:31:17
A pow change is being prepared if there is a fork and Core has a minority hash power.  That is a fact and a white flag gg 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:54:13
yea then block stream took money from the banks... remember that?
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:47:18
Read for the other side.  
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:29:01
too soon to say, but good ol pete is going off the deep end and risking further alienation to core
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:26:19
Nodes willl follow
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:34:30
My interest is in long term future for bitcoin.  Miners put their money where their mouth is to secure the network and make some profit.  Core just had a big mouth.  Miners need to be onboard with any protocol changes.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:25:25
core is the scam.  BU is organic growth away from core.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:45:59
I feel bad for blockstreams investors.. so much riding on BUs defeat 
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:37:52
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:22:27
Oh yea and who is the authority if not the consensus that is derived from hash power?  
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:21:15
Trolls = Luke, petter Todd, Adam, Greg, lomrozo etc
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:18:38
Miners say otherwise
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:39:35
so admitting this is likely is admitting defeat
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:32:49
Read the white paper.  I'll take miners acting in self interest over the questionable interests of a bank funded industry group desperate to maintain its power.
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:28:37
No I mean miners have the most invested and most to lose.  They will choose wisely the safest path to protect their investment, i.e. Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:30:01
So the 35-40% of current hash power of the largest computer network on earth is controlled by one man?
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:32:03
because to even entertain such an idea you would need a centralized body to determine the (some) variables... but this idea is so idiotic it will not fly on any main chain calling itself bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:21:16
Is your head in the sand?  Peter todds tweet was all over Reddit yesterday.  He's core when it's convenient and not when it's not 
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:01:58
Pretty much.  At least not act like they don't matter.
@_date: 2017-03-21 07:36:04
Define centralized
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:05:57
correct, but that's not a bad thing.  what incentive will miners have after all bitcoin is mined?  that is a question i haven't seen addressed with segwit/ln roadmap
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:08:32
Who is we?
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:16:45
You lost me at they aren't ramrodding a solution down people's throats 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:53:39
Nope, pow change is the only way your minority fork could survive 
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:10:04
Agreed.  And more are mining BU.  Simple
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:55:57
That's not proof of your claim, I'm not down with the groupthink 
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:59:08
people will follow the miners and their millions invested in bitcoin over following core and their reddit karma, get real
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:44:50
Because BCU expires worthless if there is no fork.
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:00:59
wow head up your ass
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:28:38
no one cares what you signed up for
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:46:01
You guys are really going to lose it now that you're talking about pow changes having failed to get support for segwit even.  The market is speaking.  Wake up.
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:45:17
BU exists to scal bitcoin because Core hasn't proposed any workable solutions to do that.  Bitcoin is not some smart contract, two layer block chain controlled by blockstream (hello centralization).  That's what the market (i.e. Hash power) is telling you right now and you need to listen 
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:47:03
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:56:36
And if you break the fundamental characteristics valued by the market (looking at you Core), the hash rate will leave you.  Double edged sword
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:23:15

we are nothing without hash power - you alienate the miners and they will go elsewhere, as will investors
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:23:51
or maybe one of the smartest guys in the room is saying non-segwit roadmaps should be seriously considered...?
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:59:59
malleability isn't a burning problem, transaction fees and scaling are the problems, wake up
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:31:51
who the fuck are you to 'kill the miners' gtfo
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:42:22
Talk is cheap, hash power is not.
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:56:11
Blockstream 
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:11:05
Or you can think of this idea as the last ditch effort of a failed leadership team who realizes that a fork will leave them on a minority hash power chain.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:58:24
if we ignore pow we will die
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:21:17
This is bigger than your one or two boogeymen.  Not acknowledging that hurts your credibility 
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:37:42
What is the problem with raising the block size?  Please answer this question.  Your answer will be taken with a grain of salt, I just saw this on rogerver.com: "I'm currently involved in numerous Bitcoin related projects. Bitcoin is the most important invention in the history of the world since the internet. If you don't already know about it, google it."
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:33:15
I think you put the cart before the horse.  Ver is in favor of scaling bitcoin.  But commented that lack of scaling forces him to explore alternatives.  Furthermore, Ver has no direct power in shaping bitcoins roadmap, whereas the core team does.  Where is the scaling roadmap, core?  Am I incorrect on any of these points?  Ver doesn't control bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:42:58
You are turning this into a straw man, dude.  Get over your obsession with Ver.  The miners don't support core's roadmap, it's not just this one guy Ver.  Now, again, please answer this question: What is the problem with raising the block size?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:07:23
the truth is the market has interpreted this as panic news and is selling off - dont listen to the news, listen to the market's reaction to the news

the article totally confused me.  max keiser doesnt understand the fundamentals of bitcoin?  almost made me think someone else wrote the article.
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:34:48
because it is a press release not a news story
