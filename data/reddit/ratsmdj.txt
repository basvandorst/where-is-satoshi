Hi from 2011 here lol even bought it. Had 3 and spent it for stupid reasons .. those 3 are worth close to 30k now and I only bought 100 dollars worth of shit ... ��

Yea my first reaction was fick who has 20k to buy bitcoin then I think of my privileged friends. 
Now moving on like the rest of the redditors say .. first rule of btc is not talk about btc. 
Funny enough I had this discussion with a bunch of buddies of mine years back on security and keeping your stuff locked down.
There are extreme ways of keeping it secure and non secure ways. You can always if your going to hodl for long term is put it in a hardware wallet and take that wallet to like a safety deposit box. Something tells me if you have 20k laying around you should have access to one.
If your going to trade or play around on exchanges use only well known exchanges etc. don’t go to any random exchange or some fly by night operation. 
There are no air drops for btc or any crypto that promises to double or triple your btc but you must send them btc first. Don’t believe these scammers.
Your wallet and your key keep it private.
Don’t get your shit hacked. Ie your online now so someone knows you have 20k just chilling it won’t be hard to start to try and dox you and go about getting access to your account and make a transfer. That shit is not reversible.
I won’t get into the details but the above should keep you safe for now. 
Now can I has my gold?

Legitimate question. 
I bought @ 8k, 8100 and 8400 respectively.
Is there any exhange that will allow me to sale like lets say I want to sell my earnings ont he 8k but still hold my other ones? Or they all just get pooled together and when i sale i just sale whatever the total amount is vs what it is trading at.
