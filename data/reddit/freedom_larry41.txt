Well, I’m surprised that Bitcoin reached 10K. I suspected it will top 9K and go down 4K by the end of 2017. Boy was I wrong.
As for crypto in general, it’s best that it’s not as volatile as before. The correction was necessary when the total market cap was already reaching  near 1 trillion in a matter of days and as a result, some people were going to get hurt during the bull run of December.
My thoughts on r / personal finance still remain about the same. Not everyone has the opportunity for a 401K or other conventional form of savings and/or trading. Thus, crypto is for the moment an approachable form of quasi-decentralized finance.

Might as well ask: does this apply to major banks such as BoA, Wells Fargo, Chase, and other major US banks?

Not trying to be a shill but this is how Tether loosely operates.

Newbie here. How is it possible that Bitcoin will rise continuously? It dipped a few years back.

We did it ladies and gentlemen!... 10K and to the moon!! Woo!

Exactly! I have mentioned the same to the gf and have tried to get her attention that, apart from investing and ROR, the technology itself disrupts old conventions of money and banking system and permits more control of one's money. Unfortunately,  she still thinks a pyramid scheme.

I'm still a newbie to all this but continously reading Satoshi Nakamoto  white paper helps understand the purpose of Bitcoin. Sure, several years after its creation somethings have changed the way Bitcoin is suppose to operate but from my point of understanding,  Bitcoin was suppose to be a secure way to trading to fiat currency. Yet,  because Bitcoin is still in its infancy to be an acceptable form of currency globally,  it's value has increased due it's increase demand in recent months.

I still say HODL. I lost a lot too but it I'm still hodling because it has not reached low significant numbers. If it dips below 2K, then yes consider it a complete loss. Simply put, this whole month of August Bitcoin made significant gains but at one point it had regulate itself. This is that moment.

Wouldn't Litecoin be better for these types of transactions? 
Also, which part of the Pomona is this at? Might have to give the SGV a visit.

Unfortunately, it had to dipped.  I get you. I made a large order when it was at 4800. Boy did I learn as noob.  It didn't help too that I had also diversified in ETH. Lesson learned,  only put in on how much you're willing to lose.  One day it may reach 5K, then next it could it go down to 3k.

Started my portfolio at 3700. Bought and sold it during various dips. Realized in Bitcoin, you win by hodling. Thus, I bought a bit at 3100. Guess the motto is true: Sell high, buy low.

Doubt it will reach 100K. While Bitcoin has drastically increased in price,  it is still a bubble. It cannot go up in price forever;  eventually it will decrease in price as most hodlers will see a price that is rationally able to sell. Additionally,  governments and financial institutions  will eventually find ways to restrict Bitcoins growth. Give it 5 more years.  May be I'm wrong.
RemindMe! 2 years

If you're  in America,  try Gemini.  Fees are much lower than Coinbase.

I use to religiously follow personalfinance as truth and be all but after a awhile it became repetitive and at times scrupulous if you don't follow their mantra. Look, we all want to get ahead and secure ourselves through the method of finance. But if they realized that some conventions like IRA, 401k, and other traditional ways of investments give poor rate of returns, they will realize why some of us are willing to take this risk. Is it a bubble? Most likely, but I am also in it because of the technology. Whether Bitcoin goes to 100K or down to a nickle, bitcoin has revolutionize financial sector forever. 
RemindMe! in 2 years if Bitcoin goes to 10K.

Right on! ��

Not going to lie. I panicked and sold and traded when the dipped happened.  Guess Uncle Sam is going to take a cut out of those trades.
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:41:26
That is been definitely true with Gemini. Been thinking of going through Kraken as well.

At this point, I see no point in diversifying in alt coins.  I have made more gains from Bitcoin in this month than the from the last several months in alt coins.
