I find bitcoin and crypto super interesting, I like to follow the news, always end up in the comments section for some reason in this sub and always find it completely *fascinating* the sense of entitlement that the r/Bitcoin user-base feels.  It's as though they think *understanding* something that giants created makes them on an equal level with them.  "I would have done this if was bitfinex," "this is how an exchange should," "why hasn't the core dev team implemented..." blah blah blah.  It's infuriating, like talking to insane people.
Bitfinex being breached and solving the problem systematically could very well make it the safest market since they better understand their failures, the whole "you don't know what you don't know" thing.  Instead you have all these kiddies investing their student loan money into a currency that they're treating like a commodity who can't wait to abandon the best option out of spite.  The fact that Bitfinex is going to try to earn the money back in commissions for it's users is a huge statement about how dedicated they are to their customers, many places would simply close their doors.

A meme is now merit for supporting a new currency?


Limited supply is not what makes anything a currency, currency is a medium of exchange, FIAT currency for instance, has no limit.
The switching between digital currencies and assets at this point is really just people trying to get rich, there is no travelling to France and requiring Litecoin to go there.  The reason we have multiple world currencies is two-fold: history, and borders.  In the long-term we may unify to a world currency (this has been discussed, and the SDR has been proposed), but there are few reasons to have more than a couple cryptocoins that are traded.  Tokens (as ownership) is a different story, but actual currency should unify to a peak technology (or a handful at best) once we really understand the path and use of digital currencies.

Market cap &amp; average volume are the metrics that matter: they represent an instantaneous snapshot of perceived value of the thing.  $1 coins aren't contextually cheaper than $15,000 bitcoin if there are 3 trillion of the former and 16.7M of the latter.
Market cap isn't a representation of business (as you stated) it's a representation of the perceived value of the outstanding coins.  But you're right that it's not a perfect metric for crypto.  Even though the market cap for bitcoin is $233b (at the time of this post) the real value is significantly lower as if people start selling off their crypto they will have to be market takers and the value of existing coins will geometrically collapse.  The same isn't as true for the buy-side, as fear and panic selling are more prominent than "holding out" for a higher prices in a volatile market, plus there are always margin-calls that cause dramatic price drops.

So far bitcoin a speculative tool that doesn't work as a store of value and doesn't work as a currency.  It has no scarcity in that it's incredible easy to create another crypto.  Bitcoin has no privacy, gold does.  I'm not saying gold is better than crypto, I am saying that bitcoin is Sears, it's got a big old brand name but it's out of date.  It will not survive in a marketplace that is evolving beyond what it's capable of and evolving at a faster pace.

You really don't understand gold back versus reserve currency.
They aren't controlling the dollar value with money supply, they're bandaging broken limbs. The US is going to see massive inflation as a result of the past years rampant dollar printing which they did to "protect the economy." China has already indicated they're no longer interested in buying bonds. This will massively diminish the dollar. This wasn't possible under the gold standard.  America's currency is propped up by stolen oil, the drug trade, the petro dollar, money printing and recirculating money through bonds. They've been a super power for about 70 years doing this and it's all really finally starting to have a negative effect on the individual wealth in America and the value of the dollar globally. Just wait for your inflation, it's coming and it's going to be big.

All of what you described adds nothing to the economy.  Why would the music store give me 5% back in BONGO coins when I spend BONGO at their store?  That is just them taking a 5% cut on their sale, so where does that come from?  Do they just suck it up?  What did the store gain from me using BONGO coins?  Do they just invent BONGO coins out of thin air, sell them to the public on an exchange so the public can give them back to the music store for resale?  Isn't that exactly the same as using cash by adding an arbitrary middleman mechanism that adds no benefit?   Are you simply talking about a rewards program?  If so, rewards need to be offset by something that actually has value.  If not, then I don't understand how you think this improves upon simply having a common currency.  Do we all just arbitrarily buy and sell tokens for every imaginable thing based on the market supply and market demand?  Isn't that exactly what the current economy already does by using cash which doesn't imply the necessity of every company having their own token that performs no useful function?
You can distil your entire example down to a simplification:  Just one currency so that we don't have to do all that other dumb shit that create no value.


So McDonald's will no longer have to advertise because they made McTokens?   Why not?  I don't know about their latest cheeseburger salad, how the hell are they going to tell me about it?  All those "middle-man" jobs aren't eliminated because you've added a token-layer to the economy, now they're just getting paid in tokens that McDonalds printed (what controls the rate at which they create them?), which is subject to the whim of the free market and may massively fluctuate in purchasing power based on decisions that McDonald's executives make - why should a worker be subjected to that?  Oh wait, they can exchange them, as you said, for something that has value to them, like say, Cash.

The micro lending platform I use is to offer short term loans to companies, the rates are lower than the bank but higher than  stocks. They provide their financial statements and have to offer up collateral and personal guarantees the same way a bank loan would. I'm not sure how the default process works because everyone has always paid, but I don't think it's as risky as you think.
My weighted average return is 11% and even if I write off a reasonable portion (call it 2-3%&gt; of my investments it still earns a solid 5-9% in the long run. The key with this, I think, is ensuring your portfolio is distributed over a lot of loans that have assets backing them.

I'm not sure where you live, but in Canada it's not the way it is in the USA.  Banks simply won't out loans sometimes because of the state of their current leverage.  An average line-of-credit in Canada is around 7.5%, but years ago it wasn't uncommon to get 11%.  
In the case that the trucking company defaults on my investment then the $75 I lent to them won't matter.  On average, investing in 50 companies for $75 under A to B class risk bands, less than 2% should default, still yielding 9% return overall on something that I'd expect 11% on.  The point of diversification is eliminating risk by keeping your eggs in multiple baskets, this is a high-yield return in my portfolio, everything else is in the 3-7% range.  You could just buy the S&amp;P and make 10% a year but I think the US stock exchange is due for a significant correction as a result of years of quantitative easing, and so I'm staying away until that happens.

The concept of the blockchain, which you don't seem to know what that implies.  Etherium, NEO, EOS, those offer universal blockchains that you could do anything on top of - smart contracts are of key importance, but micro transactions, anonymous transactions and a few other use cases are interesting as well. Creating digital currency on top of the technology of a decentralised immutable database is neato, but the currency is a use-case, the concept of storing any data in the open to prove anything that you need to prove is what is interesting.  People don't need to be paid to create a node, they only need incentive which could just simply be that they themselves need the database to exist so they can say "Yes, we host 3% of the nodes but 97% are by others, validating that the data we submit to chain couldn't be manipulated by 51% attacks and is authentic."  Saying that payment is a necessary incentive identifies your lack of understanding on what the blockchain is actually going to be used for, which is majorly going to be public accountability.  There are some people talking about centralised blockchains, but that's their own business, I'm not promoting that, I think it's stupid.
I'm not going go ahead and insult you in the same tone of your "you do you" shit, but don't convince yourself just because you believe in something more than somebody else does that you truly understand it better than they do.  Any business, investment or technology that can be obsoleted by something that offers more either evolves or dies.  I'm not saying random alt-coins are better, I'm saying things that have far more interesting technological advancements than bitcoin are better.  If you think that "bitcoin is the blockchain" then I really don't think that you understand what is going on in this ecosystem at all, and if you think branding is enough to create something then I feel sorry for your investment portfolio.  Blockchain is going to stay.  Bitcoin must evolve or it will die.

I mean that for the parties requiring a loan they get a better lending rate than the bank would give them, and the people like me are willing to do it because we can get a higher rate of return on our investment than buying stocks.
It's definitely a bad idea to invest in a business with such high risks of that, but say it's a trucking company that needs cashflow because they took on a new 3 year contract that requires 2 new trucks that they can't pay for with their current Net-90 cashflow, that to me is a good investment for 10%.

I hope you're 100% joking, you understand inflation right?  Market supply is a property of currency - limiting the supply to a finite number does not make a currency.  Do you live in the United States?  Do you understand what quantitative easing is?  America added $12 trillion to the money supply to "stimulate" the economy out of recession by lending the new money at 0% interest.  That's about as far from limiting the money supply as you can get, and it's the worlds most powerful currency.


It's commonly understood that in global economics a common world currency is the next stage to international trade.  I don't see why we would improve on the current world currencies but fail at escalating this point.  There won't necessarily be one, but there definitely won't be many.


Why would people do this?  Why would I want to have to buy and potentially hold all sorts of currencies just to inter-operate with other businesses?  That's either a significant cost or an overwhelming hassle.  You're just dreaming.  A common currency simplifies our understanding in value.  If I get paid $50 CAD (in my case) I know how much work went into getting that and I know what it's worth to me if I spend it.  If I have to buy 17 BONGO coins to do buy a drum from some music store, the BONGO coins are just an unnecessary step in the transaction when I really need to know the costs as it associates to my time-based earnings.

Currency pre-global trade was intended as a store of value as an intermediary when you did something that created more value than could be traded immediately.  We've completely lost site of that in a global economy.  Gold is measureable internationally, it creates a system where we say "this rug is 5 grams of gold, this took me x amount of days to earn, is that worth it for me?"  If it is, you give the gold and it's done.  Paper currency was supposed to simplify that.  Now we've complicated paper currency, complicated turning paper currency into digital, added unpredictable transaction fees and added capital gains tax to accounts held. The whole thing is a huge fucking mess, but I don't think the current flow of the system is going to simplify it - people need something that truly stores value, not something that loses or gains 30% in a day.  I keep cash for spending, I don't buy groceries with my investments.

The problem with what you've outlined is this:  The perceived value has the direct ability to affect a companies immediate purchasing power, thus further casting that business into a downward spiral.
If I spend McCoin to go buy a cheeseburger, and after that I write a blog post about how I hate McDonald's and am somehow a social influencer, there is the potential that lemmings holding McCoin decide to sell off on an exchange to purchase WendysCoin.  Since everyone pays McDonald's in McCoin, McDonald's now has to immediately react to this drop in demand and sell off McCoin to get MeatCoin and BunCoin so they can maintain the ability to buy from their suppliers before McCoin diminishes in value (be that temporary or permanent).  The sell-off of McCoin further sparks a volume-trading flag on the market, further dropping the value of McCoin, and when it comes time for them to cash in for RentCoin and PowerCoin, the apparent value of their coin no longer reflects the value that it had during the period in which they made the sales associated with the current accounts payable.  
So maybe every single day they should be hedging their McCoins right?  Buying a little PowerCoin and RentCoin and BunCoin everyday, and BikeCoin, and all sorts of other coins, put all that shit into all sorts of baskets because the market is completely unpredictable. That sounds like a completely fascinating world to live in doesn't it.  A real improvement on the current system.

I agree, but I also think that blindly throwing money at coins and tokens without asking the question "how could this be improved upon" is very reckless.  If you can imagine how to improve it, and everyone agrees that will improve it, the coin that does it will be more successful.  One thing people need is consistent purchasing power, for instance.  If someone identifies a clear mechanism how to do that it will be incredibly disruptive - it won't be a speculative gain, it'll be a real currency that is protected from government meddling.

The freedom to buy and sell whatever crypto you like is your choice.  People (or companies) pumping and dumping is their choice.  This community is filled with people that believe Bitcoin is some sort of Crypto-Jesus.  If that is true, it will remain untouchable in the long-run regardless of media portrayal or temporary scandal.  If a few people doing a few things against the precious jesus-coin plummet its value, then it really isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  The only reason why bitcoin got so valuable in the first place is the same media running puff pieces like "bitcoin, can it be stopped?" and dumb shit like that.  
What is happening is that the surface of the bubble is starting to tear.  People who are asking "how do I get bitcoin?" who think it's actual physical coin are starting to hear that there are alternative options, or that maybe it's not a great place to put their money, and that's tearing at the fabric of the HODL mindset, who believe their coin is and deserves to be The One and anything that doesn't promote that are "socially engineered" acts for some cause or ideology.

If arbitrage an opportunity exists for more than a minute there is usually a reason for it.  That reason for crypto is related to how difficult it is to get your money in or out of that exchange.  Earlier in the year, when Kraken changed its allowable funding methods (made it more difficult to get money in and out) the arbitrage opportunities sky rocketed, but even they only lasted for 60 seconds at best.  In a system where the crypto market cap is nearing a trillion dollars, I would be shocked and awed to find out that there are major arbitrage opportunities to be had that people aren't taking advantage of that don't have some major roadblock involved.
In my experience the fees to get cash in/out at the exchange, trade commissions, and the additional associated banking fees for really ate into my gains.  If I could make 5% on a trade I was pretty happy, at under 3% I wouldn't bother.  That was in a flatter market though, so I'm sure during these volatile times you can see better gains.

If you're gambling and know you're gambling I think it's reasonable to say "fuck, I fucked up, and knew what I was into."
When you're gambling but believe you're investing it's a completely different story. The expectation is that that money grows.  With gambling you know it can go both ways.  An unbelievable amount of people don't seem to believe that bitcoin can go down.

What pair are you trading?  BTCUSD?
I don't get how you can route the funds and make money
Trading BTCETH, say I'm holding $2k in each currency, $1k of each currency on 2 markets.  If the arbitrage exists, I buy $1k worth of BTC with $1k of ETH, now market 1 has $2k worth of BTC and the other has $2k worth of ETH, I need to find a reverse abritrage on those two markets to balance the money back out.  So you opportunity is completely diminished, as a given market is typically either higher or lower than another specific market, pretty consistently. IE Kraken bid are higher than prices at Bitfinex, always, for a given pair.
So if you need to move some of those BTC and ETH back and forth, if you made 1% off the trade, you're going to spend all of that an more on TX fees moving the BTC from exchange to exchange.

Keep in mind, it's only real if you sell.
At some point the price will hang, and people will ask if it's the top, and people will sell a little, prices will dip, that'll force some into the red, a few more sell, some will go further in the red, they'll panic sell, the market could crash over the course of minutes or hours.
Nobody is calling me to ask me how it works or why it's useful, they're calling me to ask how many I'm holding and if I still think it's a good time to buy.  People are getting in without a clue on what the fuck Bitcoin is or does.
Do not make plans off of money you don't have.  This mania will end.  At the current transaction fees and mining electricity costs, bitcoin is a ridiculous failure of a currency - if one of these alt coins that is up-and-coming takes that place, bitcoin is nothing but the dream that someone will pay more.  It's a digital beanie baby.  There are far more useful alt coins, do blindly follow the lemmings unless you believe in bitcoin at its core.

You have money on both markets, USD and BTC, or whatever you're trading.  LTC and ETH. ETH and NEO.... etc
Execute a buy and sell on both markets simultaneously. You only rebalance currencies from one market to another if it becomes completely depleted on one of them.
You need a lot of capital to make arbitrage worthwhile. I have a bot that does it on crypto exchanges. With fees, it's not worth it unless the price is volatile (creates major disparity gaps for 5-15 seconds), and really wouldn't do it manually for a few dollars here and there. There are far better pairs to do it with than BTCUSD. xETH is better, or xLTC, easier to move.
I ultimately stopped doing it because the fiat was costly to move and I didn't want to hold $25k+ in a given crypto as this whole thing clearly became a bubble a month ago.

It's a memory based security consider, which I would say is quite a remote possibility of vulnerability.   If you're susceptible to having your server memory analyzed you've got bigger fish to fry, like the hacker inside your system.

This is why mistitling this has consequences. 
With actual public key encryption there is a ring of public keys. If Alice, for example, had her public key stored on a server, a third party has to verify that it is actually Alice's key prior to it being trusted. 
If somebody is on the line intercepting the data the consequence is that it can be manipulated. This is why RSA is used in SSL, and bitcoin uses a similar algorithm that doesn't require a negotiation of a common key.

I'd like to know how the value of the thing excludes it from being an experiment?  That doesn't cater to it failing, this thing is in its infancy, and has a lot of potential, but the point of my post was to illustrate that many people here have no understanding (and don't want to) of why this probably isn't going to go anywhere for quite some time.  Now more than ever people are jumping off the bandwagon since the "miracle investment" that their techy nephew told them about isn't paying off in dividends.
A big pussy?  Can't take it?  I'm being objective about the state of this thing.  How am I a pussy?  That is the most misguided insult I've ever heard.  Anyway, let's hear your theories, I'd love to get some of *your* insight.  It's easy to spout off vague statements like "this is a living breathing system" but what the fuck does that actually mean?  How does that add value to the thing?  What are you getting at? This is still an experiment in decentralized digital currency.  It's come a long way, but it's not infallible.  My point is that people (like you) should take their heads out of the sand (or in your case, your ass) and accept all opinions equally, not just the ones that they hope are true.
Say the market cap of the thing is $5.6 billion dollars right now (I think it's more actually), what does that mean?  That means that people don't want to sell for less than the market cap right now, it doesn't prevent the bubble from popping if a significant percentage of those people originally purchased at some point below the present value.  One day if they want out the price will drop.
Once people stop treating this as an investment and everybody has paid close to the same price per coin it can become a stable currency.  It can rise with demand (or more likely, inflation).  At the moment the wild fluctuations are interesting for somebody that averages a low 'buy-in' price, but for those that have none it's a huge risk of losing your value, and for those who bought high they have no interest in selling at such a loss.  My point is that bitcoin is great as  a currency, it has its function of serving as the cash-equivalent for digital purchases if you buy it and use it right away, but its function offers very few benefits at this moment.  The average consumer does not want to buy bitcoin so they can buy something from newegg.com, they'd rather just pay with a credit card.  And why wouldn't they?  Bitcoin shines in countries with unstable governments, but only if the ability for people to purchase it isn't controlled, which it most likely will be in a hyper-inflating economy.  
There is more at work here than your dreams.  This thing is complicated, and it's in its infancy, and it certainly isn't polished, and it isn't necessarily the global economic savior.  Who knows what it is?  It's an experiment.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:09:13
In that I include 'double-spends,' but last night I was also thinking about a scenario (which may or may not be possible):
If a pool has 50%+1, a poisonous node within that pool may be capable of crafting a sort of man-in-the-middle attack where they create a block which forges some transactions (which obviously wouldn't check-out if evaluated against their hashes).  The block would reference the previously existing block, would have a valid header (which doesn't calculate properly) and would be linked to by the next (valid) block.  Now you have a forged block in the change that you (as far as my knowledge about processing of elder parts of the blockchain goes) would go unchecked until somebody realized that money from their address was spent in that block.
It was just a crazy idea, and I could be wrong.

I do.
I'm saying that if you have an authenticated routine residing at /login/ on your server, that code should process the login and forward the user to a resulting location if they succeeded or failed.  The /login/ page itself should never call external resources.
What you said is mostly true about the referrer fields, except when a resource requested over HTTPS requests to another HTTPS resource.  A resource requested from an HTTPS connection to a HTTP connection does not forward the referrer header.  I believe that's cover in the RFC.

OK go. Blanket statement, now back it up.


Again, it's in its infancy.  Nest just got purchased for 3.2 billion dollars with $125 million in revenue.  Sometimes things are overvalued, and that's ok, it doesn't mean they won't succeed or that they're bad ideas.  Maybe $800 is not the right price, but who cares?
At the end of the day the consumer has decided that *so far* bitcoin is primarily a digital gold.  It has all these features to be a great currency, but that's not its current primary function.  That can easily change.  And the price of bitcoin is irrelevant so long as it is stable.

The thing that people in bitcoin don't seem to understand is that it is a currency.  There are other alt coins that better serve as a store of value (ie: peercoin), but bitcoin was intended to be spent.
The majority of people that I've seen in this bitcoin community are using it as a method of financial gain.  That sort of thing works under extraneous circumstances, like how it worked for gold when the U.S. re-pegged to it as the standard, but for the most part gold (like bitcoin) will only retain the value input into it as it rises with inflation.
There is no intrinsic gain from bitcoin as a store of value.  The supply has met the demand, the price is $500-$600 depending on who is exiting that day realizing it's not the big pay-out the tech guy at the office said it would be.  There is no reason it should spike, there is almost no benefit to using bitcoin in the majority of the societies that it's prevalent in today.  Places like Argentina, Brazil and the Philippines could use it as a stabilized world-currency, and we (the first world) will maybe one day be able to do that too, but many of us don't suffer from the same consequences that they do, that their currency is wildly unstable and they aren't allowed to freely move their money around or purchase financial stability instruments.
Counter-points such as "just you wait" are pretty close to the gambler's fallacy.  The real questions to those investing in bitcoin is why are you doing it?  Why should it go up in value?  It's a *currency*, you're basically keeping cash under your digital mattress.  Why should it go to $20,000 USD per?  even if 1BTC were worth a million dollars it's divisible by an accessible decimal value (ie: you could spend 1 cent increments).  It needs to be worth 1 billion + for there to be a real supply and demand issue, none of this bullshit falsely generated hype-based value.
I'm sorry to say it guys, but your "too the moon" days are numbered.  I know this is your dream, but it's most likely not going to happen.  Sure, keep 10% of your savings in bitcoin, or something reasonable, and maybe it goes to the moon or maybe everybody has finally all paid the same price and it steadily rises with inflation, but don't turn this into a stock that fucks you over and don't turn this into a retirement plan.

There are always going to be fluctuations.  
Bitcoin is not:
1) An investment that will continuously rise for no particular reason
2) A great store of value (at the moment - maybe it will be when all 21 million have been mined)
3) An economical way for the average person to spend money if they don't have a real need for it.

You make valid points, but everything you say is a coin toss because it's not only a revolutionary concept but it's also in its infancy. I'm amazed that things picked up as fast as they did this year, it's largely due to our tech bubble/startup culture. People want in on the ground floor. It doesn't mean Bitcoin isn't going to succeed. 
Bitcoin is a currency, it has features and capabilities that our current currency infrastructure will never be capable of. These features make it stand on its own, most of them are not utilized by anybody yet because the currency is still finding its footing. Without a government to force people to adopt it (eg. The greenback) it will need to grow organically and it will need to prove its function. 
Sure, people can it out to fiat right now, but if it finds a footing in society it will make just as much sense to keep it as it would American and Canadian dollars if you travel between those to two countries, except now one of the countries isn't a country, it's the Internet.

There is no implication that he is storing it in cleartext from that screen shot.  It was sent over cleartext, you don't know what happens on the server-side.  Probably it's salted and hashed, anyway, you nor I can suppose how that works on their back-end.
Sure it's a bad security practice to send a password via a get request, that's true, but this screen post is ridiculous to begin with.  It's a lot of supposition about how things work on the gox back-end.  Everybody knows that POST &gt; GET when submitting secure data, the benefits and determent I won't even speak to since any good security conscious developer would know.
With respect to your comment about sending a cleartext password, this is common practice (via post).  That is the whole point of HTTPS.  If you hashed the password before sending it to the server somebody could just view the source and replicate your method.  It's just as vulnerable as cleartext.
The secure solutions is to post data over https and hash and salt on the server-side.  That's industry standard.

Not *the* invention, *an* invention.  And despite bitcoin being *useful* it doesn't mean that it's worth $180 per, or $1000 per.  Until the speculation dampers out and people become more rational about it.
Right now, based on the difficulty and hash rates, if you bought a 1Thz rig it'd break-even with current electricity costs in like 3 years and 2 months at current prices (assuming electricity doesn't go up, and the price of bitcoin doesn't go up).
The net earnings on a rig like that after you break-even are about $40 per month.  
That's not a great return, and assumes that something better than bitcoin isn't invented, and that could even be a modification based on bitcoin.  
The invention here is decentralized banking, which is pretty awesome, but it has so many drawbacks.  Like what if governments force ISP's to block the traffic?  Or those governments disallow the currency to be converted to their fiat?  The whole thing could just go out the window, which adds risk-factor to it.  
As it stands people who buy bitcoin are either speculating or using it as a mechanism to transfer fiat currency.  There is no real incentive to buy bitcoin and use the currency right away to make purchases, in fact there are many detriments (i.e. non-reversible transaction).  There are benefits, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's without benefit.  So you've got people like you who are speculating who falsely inflate the currency value, and then you've got people using it as a mechanism who don't add to the currency value at all by their short-term hold duration.
So tell me, where is the real value as an investment?
Edit: I would argue that the electricity cost of mining + a little gravy (let's say 10%?) is the value.  1 BTC costs roughly $62 in electricity to mine right now.  So I would price BTC around $65-$70 / BTC.  $180 is still insane.  I think it will continue to fall until that happens.
Edit 2:  Some additional food for thought.  Since the network targets difficulty such that a block is generated roughly every 10 minutes, the costs of people's rigs isn't something that sets value for bitcoin as a currency.  If all the miners quit except one, you would still expect to see roughly 144 blocks per day, at the same electricity costs you can see that reducing the number of miners actually reduces the intrinsic (i.e. non-speculative) value of each coin.  So the fact that somebody paid $1500 for their rig doesn't factor in at all and their recuperation of their expenses is only proportional to the demand of bitcoin, which as I've stated above I believe is solely based on speculators all trying to out-rich each other based on acquiring low and selling high.

Bitcoin is a currency, a form of money.  Money covers all mediums of exchange that store value, that can be broken down into units.  There is no single thing that is actually "money," that is not what the word represents, all currencies are "money."  If I rob you and said "give me your money" I mean all of it, I don't mean your US bills only.
From wikipedia:


(emphasis mine, to illustrate my point)
A store of value is something that won't depreciate.  A car isn't a store of value, but shouldn't "rot" over time.  A store in value typically must be finite or have predictable generation and predictable appreciation.  Bitcoin isn't really a store of value because the market is too volatile with speculators.
@_date: 2016-06-26 01:53:46
A store of value: Something that maintains the value that you paid for it at with respect to inflation.  Is capable of later being exchanged for currency that can purchase the same goods that it was capable of purchasing at the time you "stored the value" in the "store of value." 
Some people are using bitcoin as a store of value, and some are using it as money, others are using it as a transport mechanism to get money out of economies that have restrictions on money export.  For these reasons (and more) bitcoin is very volatile, not a great store of value at the moment. Ultimate, if it stabilizes and finds a place in the economy, it should become one, otherwise why hold onto it? Many hold because they are speculation its future value will increase, in ways that's seeing it as an investment, and as a store of value. If those people don't use it as a currency (it is a currency), it will remain volatile to a degree making it an unpredictable currency,which is a very important thing for people who aren't speculating but just don't want to lose value. 
Right now, the world hasn't agreed on how to use bitcoin. I would guess that the majority of its value is held as people use it both as an instrument to store value and as people speculate on its ability to make them more wealthy. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:10:00

LN is promising but that is just another layer swooping in to answer the problems that bitcoin couldn't solve. Why should I lock my money into an extra payment network layer when it was already in a payment network? Only because that original network failed by hitting its limit? Bitcoin is broken as fuck and it isn't even widely used. If you believe it's not dead then I don't know what to tell you. The only people who believe in it just want to get rich.

Credit cards offer a benefit to the holder:  Credit.
That allows you to buy things with future money, and to buy things with money that you have but don't have on you.
Bitcoin offers you cash that can be digitally stolen, higher consumer transaction fees than cc's or cash, and no real useful benefit aside from international transfer - the barrier to which of obtaining bitcoin and having to have someone convert it to cash, losing money to the bid/ask and exchanges/atm's whatever else probably completely destroy any encountered benefits.

trade volume at a given price is what gives and asset like this value.
If there are only 10 bitcoin in the world and everyone traded them consistently back and for that $1000, nobody would want to sell for less, giving it price stability at, $1,000.
If nobody else wants it for a long period of time you may see someone sell at a loss, but if there is consistently volume around the same price point that usually becomes a point of price support. So volume is pretty important, and that is bitcoin being traded as you stated it.

You have no idea what I know about bitcoin, I'm not going to explain my experience with it because you've kicked things off with your assumptions which tells me this conversation isn't worth any time.  The technology is a concept that is easily replicated, especially given that it's open source - this is clear from the number of altcoins that exist.  So why bitcoin?  Why not any of the other alts?  The very nature of bitcoin forking to BCC and BCG is the admission that bitcoin isn't perfect.  But what itself creates value in each coin besides the demand by another speculator?  How many people are actually using the currency as a currency?   If you automatically think you're right because you want to believe that you are, you're going to fall pretty hard when things in the bitcoin economy change - and they will.  100%, guaranteed.  Hopefully you make a nice profit before that happens, but nothing is stopping bitcoin from being worth $5 USD five minutes from now.  It's all a game of "the greater fool."

Useful technology must consider the use process not just the technology design itself.

Buying bitcoin isn't investing in the tech of bitcoin.  Buying bitcoin is investing in the hope that you can sell at a higher price.  Paying the dev's and getting a return on their work if they are able to gain profits from their tech would be investing in bitcoin tech.
It's amusing that you're making reference to Buffet, a guy who has built his fortune off of value investing, who has repeatedly said bitcoin is a bubble.
If tomorrow nobody decides to buy another bitcoin on an exchange, there is no measurable FIAT value for bitcoin.  There are no assets to liquidate.  There is nothing to melt down and sell off.  It is not an investment, it is either a currency or it's a speculation tool, but it's not an investment.

Ethereum doesn't support it did it once and bitcoin people hate it because they can't believe other tech uses blockchain and has value that isn't based off a speculative bubble.
Hard forking (more or less) is when you force a change/rollback in the blockchain.  It happened after the first major "ICO" in ETH fucked up their contract code and an industrious "hacker" siphoned off millions of dollars exploiting a mistake in the code.  This was early on in Ethereum's life cycle, and arguably a mistake that suggested that the blockchain isn't truly immutable but could be manipulated if the consensus was to do so. Call it a 51% attack equivalent.  Since then the team has made it clear they do not intend do that again.

It's dropping because it's a bubble. Have you just been drinking Kool aid by the pool and convincing yourself with memes that this shit is a sound way to make money?
There's no such thing as a "sell wall", market support and resistance are the extremely fluid, they may last for months but they may only last for days or even minutes. It's market perception, it's speculation, it's playing off trying to predict the human psyche.
There have been months of gains, bitcoin itself moved from $1,200 to $19,000 in less than a year, does that sound reasonable to you? With everyone and their mom saying "I'm going to buy bitcoin, it can't lose!" and with consistency holding true. Well now that dream is over, because nobody wants into the scheme anymore. With no new market demand there comes dropping volume. With dropping volume comes no gains for day traders. With those diminishing gains drops the buy and sell support, and then you're only left with the few people still trickling into the market who are so behind the times that they still think bitcoin is revolutionary tech.
Who is still buying is the real question, and for what purpose. Once people lose faith that they can make a quick buck it becomes reality. Belief is the key to currency value, and if people don't believe that bitcoin is sticking around, or that it can't get them a fast massive return, or a risk free return, or that the whole crypto sphere is a fad, or any other thought about it at all that is against, then it's worthless to them and they will want out.
That's what's happening, in my opinion. There is no way to know what the entire trading population is thinking, but the opinions of the community are that it's always going to go up forever and ever and nothing will ever be better and that's really fucking stupid.

Hey buddy.
I never described bitcoin as anonymous.  I said it's not anonymous.  The reason why people liked it originally was because people believed it was anonymous.  People bought drugs with it because they believed it as untraceable.  Why would people use a currency that is classified by government as an asset, which is volatile, which takes clearance times of &gt;15 minutes, that is traceable, and is uninsured if you get robbed at gun point?  My point: bitcoin is crap as a currency, and if it's a store of value then it's doing a really bad fucking job.

That's the basis for the graph, the chart would include the value of a bitcoin in USD for any given time sample and subtract costs. This chart is bullshit because who knows what the costs are? miner investment? electricity?
The very minimum value a miner would sell a bitcoin for is cost plus some margin, so it's a base level for the intrinsic value in bitcoin, but you have to take a weighted average over the entire existence of bitcoin which is very unlikely incorporated in this graph. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:33:35
Your whole statement is predicated on the assumption that you can time the market. You're assuming that when you sell it keeps falling and doesn't turn around in the next few minutes. What if you sell for $10k, go to a meeting and it's now, $15k?
If something is crashing and you are trying to predict the future results you're speculating. If you really believe there is a justifiable long term target value for bitcoin that is more than what you've paid for it then just sit back and wait.
The problem is even "HODLers" don't even believe that, they are just crossing their fingers and hoping. And investing useless loose change anyway. Nobody "buying the dip" is throwing another 5,10,15k+ in. Its County fair money dreaming of becoming Disneyworld money. That ship has sailed.

I do know that in order to have a store you need to purchase things from others and mark them up.  How do you purchase things?  With money.  If the owners of overstock.com want to keep 5-10% as an investment that's very different than holding bitcoin as a cash reserve to fund operations.


I'm not talking about key countries leaving being an issue because those bitcoin are worthless, those countries are key demand points, they are wealthy nations where people are willing to take risks for this "investment."  It's not about those bitcoin being worthless inherently, it's about massive volumes of demand falling off the cliff and that sparking a decline in value as the market floods itself with sellers who fall desperate under lack of liquidity.


ISP's can't put a stop to data traffic as a whole, but they can packet-filter beyond belief.  If you believe that the private root SSL certificates are actually private and that all data transmission is not viewable, by say the NSA or the five eyes or whatever, I would say that's a pretty naive thought.  If all traffic is viewable then all traffic is filterable and in that case, stoppable.  If they do have that technology, it's definitely far from impossible to single out bitcoin network data packets

You don't typically spend currency on another currency that serves no purpose to you.
If we're not talking about bitcoin as a store of value, there is no benefit to spending money to buy bitcoin if the TX fees are equal or worse across the board.  The fallacy is that bitcoin is more useful than money, or more valuable than money.

What are the benefits is a better question.
Some detriments:
* The anonymous transactions turned out not to be anonymous at all
* The transaction costs are now exorbitant
* The block verification times are too long to make it usable at a PoS
* Inflationary system has slowed justification to spend to a halt, to the point where it is more recognisable as a commodity
* As a commodity it only holds value if somebody else is interested in buying in - as it's not consumable - essentially making it a pyramid scheme.  If everyone started selling off for fiat there would be people who get nothing.  
* There are better technologies that exist already that include the capabilities of Bitcoin and further extend them, and have further resolved some of the issues mentioned above 
Those are a few key points that I see serious issue with, off the top of my head.

That's all it would take for a massive fall-out, the results completely unpredictable, but I can't see them being great for the average bitcoin holder unless of course their bitcoin actually had some fungible quality in the world - which as this point, they barely do at all.

1. Requires mixing.  Mixing requires trust.  How can you trust when mixing code is private?  All it takes is an insider deciding to cut and run on a given day.
2.  No they aren't.  Small payments (~$10) can easily result in a 10% transaction fee.  That's completely absurd.
3. Yes, it's usable, it's not practical to have someone sit there for 30 minutes and wait for 5-6 verifications
4. I don't see what your point is, currency must be spendable, inflationary currency in the past has resulted in hording of money and resulted in recession.  Why spend today if your money is worth more tomorrow?  If everyone holding a currency has the same mentality it's detrimental to the economic system, but also produces an over-inflated value which will rapidly collapse when spending is necessary.  If bitcoin was actually a currency this wouldn't be the state of affairs, people may have a net savings, but they would be required to spend some too to live their lives.  Bitcoin is like gold, and gold is not the currency of the future.
5. Not true.  Bitcoin is valued based on perception within each country where people are buying it, but that perceived value is balanced across the globe via arbitrage.  That arbitrage is based on the fiat exchange rates in those countries.  If it was based on something else that was independent of the strength of those countries economies you could begin to have this discussion, but you can't, since that is how the world works.  It is not "0.001 bitcoin gets you a gallon of milk anywhere in the world," and that inherently is the flaw with breaking bitcoin free of the fiat system.  Poor in Venezuela = Poor in Canada, regardless of your currency held.  The real point of this is there is no purpose to buy bitcoin.  If every product wasn't pegged to some fiat value and bitcoin stood completely on its own, bitcoin would appreciate in value over time and the fiat cost (the tangible government sanctioned money you get paid to do your job) would have a lower buying-power per bitcoin over time, balancing your cash-flow value out to net-zero.  If you hold, and bitcoin continues to appreciate, then those holdings would gain interest over time, but so do other investments.
6. Yes.  Zcash. Monero. Ethereum.  What does bitcoin do that those can't? Legitimately.  Forget the fallacy that "First is best" and please explain.
You're the epitome of what my original comment was about.  Some arrogant final statement of "good thing the top of your head is really irrelevant" in attempt to discredit my perspective, only preceded with a bunch of garbage as though you'd somehow legitimately supplied proof for your beliefs.

When it comes down to investments, analysts are supposed to be determining actual projections for the hedge funds that they work at so they can  make successful investments.  An analyst projection which is not being actively traded by themselves or the people they work for is 100% horseshit, if nobody is willing to trade it then nobody believes that's it's true.  It's not bad that this analyst predicted this, but there's an incredibly high chance that he's wrong and an even higher chance that nobody he knows is actively trading on this information:  I mean if he was, you'd see volumes spike to insane levels after this article came out because financial institutions would want the free lunch.  Hedge funds make 10-15% per year in profit, they could get 1000% return if they invested on this "analysis."  It's horseshit.

I didn't say the transactions were anonymous, the addresses are, that is until you trace a coin across all of its transactions and follow it to its exit point, giving someone a good starting point on "who paid you with this."

I don't own bitcoin, I've been out for a while now on this one as soon as I realized it was never going to do what cryptos real base intentions were. So many of these dumb investors weren't even around for that, they just started pumping bitcoin when they thought they could make a buck. 
Holding is stupid, this whole market is a trainnwrecku. I don't understand how you believe what you're saying isn't trying to time the market. You're literally cashing out at some point you're convinced is not the bottom and that you're going to buy in at some later time that this the bottom. That's called timing the market. You get that right?

Being right doesn't mean you make money, if you're right 50.1% of the time, your returns on your successful investments have to be bigger than your losses by a certain margin (~0.4%), otherwise your losses exceed your gains regardless of your success rate. 
Being right isn't the only thing that's important, the amount you invested when you were wrong can sink ships. 
Also very few funds consistently break the market gains when consideed on a ten year timeline, it's some skill but a lot of luck.

Comparing sending bitcoin to buying stocks is a non-starter.
"It's value is in that people can take part in and own Bitcoin" that is not value, owning something isn't value, value is value.  A knife is valuable because you can cut things.  Bitcoin isn't valuable until it can do something that isn't pure speculation.
The number of US dollars out there is known by the Federal reserve.  Saying you don't buy into any given country's political agenda with respect to money is one thing, but unfortunately we live in a world where we all live in a country that has its own currency or uses another nations currency.  Your lack of belief in the system doesn't matter, you live in it.  Unless you're going off the grid with your bitcoin buds and just trading forever then good luck.

If China and the USA block fiat-to-bitcoin transactions your party is over, bitcoin becomes basically worthless.  Add in Europe and Japan and then it's completely shut down.  Without bitcoin having some sort of basis of value there is no reason why a pizza should cost $10000BTC or $1234098123890123089098BTC.  No store fronts want to hold it right now, they transact in it and cash out directly to fiat.  There is a lot wrong with bitcoin, there are some things that are right about it, but if you believe this is an un-ending progression to infinite wealth you're going to get your world rocked at some point - and that point is either going to be the bubble bursting on its own, or government regulation preventing bitcoin from growing.

That formula is basically static unless you have a salary change or a change in your expenses, and you come up with an hourly number that is your "burn rate"  -  for every hour you work you can spend $X on non essentials.

What are you saying?
I'm not sure that you understand password salting.  In the database:
user = petertodd
password = laksdfjlkasdjflkasdjflkasdjflkasdnvjlksdvnoiera (HASH)
salt = 09uasdlkjvnln (whatever)
Let's say the password is hashed using sha256, and the hacker has all the info from the db, using some basic information from [this post]( resulting in say 650 million hashes per second (based on a Radeon HD5830 GPU), if you used a 74 character spectrum (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, special characters and a few other (but  not all) chars from the keyboard ascii range) a 10 character password could theoretically take 4.92x10^18 possibilities, **at 650 million per second that is 87,678 days.**
This is why you use complex passwords.  
By no way is that reasonably calculable per-user.
The whole point of salting is to eliminate the possibility of using pre-calculated tables, so **the salt is actually the very exact thing that  protects the users password in these circumstances.**

It's also kind of shitty that if somebody trusted has a copy of the wallet and can transfer some of the BTC out, it doesn't mean that they have the most up-to-date copy, so some of that BTC may be forever lost.
I wonder if DPR was smart enough to transfer a wallet backup to another server with a dead mans switch to transfer it to a known cold-storage address (ie: brain wallet) after x days of him not responding. I'd love to see the feds crack that wallet or force him to hand over the wallet password to find all the addresses had been emptied.

I think you're talking about brute forcing a specific address and trying to come up with the private key for that address. I'm talking about generating a random private key hash, checking the associated address for a balance, and then stealing that balance if there is one. 
This is very real, and has nothing to do with entropy or supercomputers, it all comes down to luck. Sure the probably is low, but if you have a ton of bitcoin at one address you could wake up and find it gone, regardless of tight security measures. This is the only point I'm trying to make.

Cars mechanically depreciate, which I can't say the same about these electronics, so I don't think your punchline is too fitting.  As for your first point, it's too quick to start making assumptions.  Perhaps that unit was actually a test unit that had been running for a while, and with production delays they decided to get rid of some of the test unit inventory rather than delay shipments?
Just because these things "make money" doesn't mean that they need to treat delays any differently than any other manufacturer, and without more information it's pretty foolish to say people's RoI dropped.  The housing market can fluctuate from the time you purchase to the time you take possession, it doesn't mean that anybody owes you the difference.

I have a major beef with paper wallets.  Based on the intelligence level of a lot of the people I see post in this subreddit, I don't think the majority of people understand how transactions work with respect to a wallet and an address.
If some uneducated person has a paper wallet and decides to spend some bitcoin, they don't necessarily understand that the money is no longer on that address, a change address was created where the money is now stored.
I feel like on the (bad) advice of a lot of users, a lot of bitcoin are going to be lost forever when they import their paper-wallet key, spend some money, and then inadvertently delete their bitcoin-qt (electrum, armery, etc) installation.
Store it in a proper piece of software, with proper encryption, use a password, back it up somewhere is.  If you're insane and feel like you need to use a paper wallet please read about transactions, wallets, private keys and understand how your money changes around.

Keep in mind this subreddit is filled with tinfoil hats. What this guy said isn't necessary to keep your coins safe. If he took it a step further, to be truly safe, you don't keep your wealth in a cryptocurrency invented by some anonymous guy. If you don't trust fiat, buy something you can trade. The whole principle of what this guy said is just as ridiculous as what I said. 
Sure, it's a cool idea and bitcoin may evolve into something big, but there's a lot of people here with very little understanding of cryptography, security or even bitcoin giving a lot of stupid advice that is completely unrealistic. 
I've been outspoken before about the ability to spend other people's money via guessing their seed. It's a consequence of garbage in = garbage out. Don't use simple seeds. 
99% of people don't need to worry. Install a bitcoin wallet app, keep your money there on your computer in an encrypted wallet.

A primary key is a ~53 character hash, entropy and the stupidity of what into the seed has little to do with the fact that there are potential rainbow tables out there monitoring the TX and cross checking their databases for the associated addresses. 
What you say is not true, all primary keys are more vulnerable to increasing computing power. Yes, your odds of your coins being taken are low but brainwallet or bitcoin-qt generated pk are all equally vulnerable.

If there were backdoors that Microsoft built-in for the NSA to use there would be a really good chance that security experts / hackers / exploiters would have found and exploited them already.
He never said you could just 'bug' computers in the intention to say that all electronics/computers are hacked, they can track your data at your ISP, your inbound and outbound, but it doesn't mean that they have unlimited access to your PC.  This would take collaboration of the operating system developer (Apple, Microsoft, Linux Foundation, Unix), and all the hardware developers.  
Datacenters != Home PC.
You can't just 'scan all computers with windows for bitcoin clients.'

Because you don't create dialog with silently disagreeing with people, and the lack of dialog is what causes others who aren't concerned about a topic to accept what they read. 
Your first response to a software developer team choosing not to accept a controversial currency because the public wants them to is "who cares they aren't trusted."  That isn't even relevant to the point, the point here is about currency and delivery of services. 
There is a portion of this community that presses the absurd motion that they don't want to spend any fiat currency anymore and that if you don't offer bitcoin they will simply find an alternative that will. That is absurd. Until they are paid salary in bitcoin (which I think it's fair to say the majority are not), there is no reason they should express such a value. It costs commission to get bitcoin, and it's going to be turned back into fiat. The majority of these people seem to enjoy the illusion that you do, that their life deserves the utmost level of secrecy. 
I think that's absurd. 
Here, in this thread, is the topic of services with a company of convenient backup. That's it. Sure, their security probably isn't the best, but you know what? Some of the most secure vaults have been robbed. What does it mean? You can't trust anybody with your shit. 
The reason why I'm typing all of this is equate you've written a fair amount of the exact same bullshit about software solutions in this thread. If you have data that need securing, you're fucked. If it really needs securing somebody is going to tear out your fingernails one by one until you give it to them. 
Until then, your encrypted zip file on your dropbox is fucking fine.

's question was not about $70,000 in bitcoin, it's about *his* bitcoin being safe in *his* bitcoin-qt encrypted wallet.
I honestly think it's really stupid to have $70,000 in bitcoin at this point, but this thread is not about my opinion.  I keep a few hundred dollars in my leather pocket-wallet, I don't see any reason to duct-tape it shut and put a padlock on it.  
Personally I think that if you're keeping massive sums of wealth in bitcoin at this time you're a fool, regardless of how you store it.  If you kept the majority of your wealth in liberty coin's you'd be broke now.  The future of bitcoin is uncertain, that is for sure.  Not just the value, but the future of.
*If* the U.S.A. (major internet world hub) decides to packet-drop all bitoin-network traffic, if they decide it's a danger to their clutch on the world's currency, then bitcoin will become worthless in a short time.
So let's not get all tinfoil hat and talk about how to best secure your tens of thousands, because if you're at the point already there's a good chance you're fully-retarded.
And before you get all in a huff, this isn't about bitcoin being a bad idea or not being part of the future, but it's most certainly not stable at the moment as the world adapt's to the new concept.  There are people that are going to make millions and people that are going to lose them.  Nothing is concrete.

It wouldn't take ages, and I guarantee it will happen and that people's BTC gets stolen.  There will be collisions, it will happen, sure the probabilities are monumentally low, but it will happen.  People win the lottery 'ery day.
Entropy lowers the probability that somebody can regenerate your private key programatically with a RNG, or with a seed phrase, but at the end of the day it's all luck, and sometimes people get lucky.  
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:37:34
What you're saying isn't quite right.  A single private key is not equivalent to a wallet, it's just equivalent to one bitcoin address.  A wallet can contain as many active addresses as there were transactions to that wallet.  Each address has it's own private key, so knowing 'a' private key wouldn't get you very far.
If you have a wallet that generates private keys based on an initial seed and some sort of numerical incrementation, then you could definitely regenerate and spend the bitcoins.  I'm not sure if they'd use this tech, since you risk losing the whole wallet even outside of being hacked, since somebody could attain your seed and thus every single address you own.

Do you understand anything about computer security and exploitation?
You can't just pick a target and hack into their personal machine.  There are layers of protection, and there need to be vulnerabilities unless there is a backdoor that is accessible in every later.  This would mean that your router/firewall supplier and your operating system are both vulnerable and those vulnerabilities are compatible.  
This is not what he is alluding to.  He is alluding to getting your phone records, your phone conversations as they are recorded by your phone provider, your facebook, gmail, ISP, and whatever else data-mining, but not what is on your machine.  
That's the point I'm trying to make.  Person-by-person they can analyze the data available by all of your data-providers, and they could *try* to hack into your personal computer, but it doesn't mean that they can just turn on a key-logger and get all your data that isn't being submitted to the internet or transmitted over the lines.

What so many people seem to be assuming is that bitcoin is a replacement for existing currencies. It is not. There are a lot or built-in features that have not been utilized yet that make bitcoin an extremely useful digital currency, such as escrow and micro transactions. The fact that I can pay somebody 40 cents across the globe if I want to without being charged fees is amazing. This isn't something that should necessarily have the value that it presently does, but if it can find its way out of market volatility lead by people trying to get rich, then we can actually start using it for some of the intended purposes. 
There is no infrastructure for this yet, and there is no present reason to spend. We'll see what happens when the bubble bursts and where the support is then. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:02:37
That's not the point, the point is your account is labeled as "dormant" regardless of holding a balance.  If you make a cash deposit and decide that you are waiting for a certain market price, which could take a few days, they may in the meantime execute their script and take $50 of your dollars since your account is in dormancy.
They assume no liability for your bitcoins, as they state in their terms, I assume this is just them trying to close up cash-balances for accounting purposes, but they needn't do that, since at any given filing they will have liabilities that they need to file for anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:02:06
Because we all get inundated with key loggers and trojans right? In most cases people are OK to keep an encrypted wallet on their computer. If you gave tens of thousands of dollars in BTC, then sure, save that in a truecrypt container and keep a backup. 
As I said before, keeping a digital currency locked away in an unspendible place will kill the currency. If everybody is just holding and hoping it goes up in value people will get bored of trying to acquire it and the markets will crash. 
We need to be able to get bitcoin quickly and cheaply and use it for something useful, like micro transactions. 
The hording mindset needs to go. It works for now, but it will destroy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:36:37
What I'm failing to understand is how spending bitcoins benefits the consumer who doesn't have any. There is a 3% transaction fee to buy into the market (cavirtex), and you basically pass on the savings to the merchant where normally they would be handling all of the fees. I also do understand that prices have gone up over time to reflect the merchant credit card costs. 
I won't spend my bitcoin right now because there is absolutely no benefit to me unless the physical item is reduced in price if I pay with bitcoin. Am I alone on seeing this as a major flaw in the bitcoin economy?

@_date: 2013-10-13 15:51:21
Here you're talking about the NSA, not Dropbox, and nobody is excluded from their power. 
At some point people have trusted other people with their information or belongings. You would trust your bank not to go into your safety deposit box, and you have to trust the company storing your data not to go through your files. 
Whether or not you trust Dropbox is a separate discussion to whether or not the public has reason to mistrust them explicitly because their software is closed source. Sure, nobody wants people going through their data, but there are claims making implications that the fault is of Dropbox, when he fault is truly of the NSA for making the Internet an untrusted zone. 
Long and short: the trust part of this thread has nothing to do with Dropbox, and everything to do with the whole Web. The bitcoin portion of this thread has nothing to do with software features everything to do with running a business. 
The fact that so many people here seem like pitchfork toting witch-burners set out to protect and propagate their bitcoin cause is rather frightening.

If you're ultimately going to have a wallet keypool that you are keeping track of, what is the point of paper wallets?
Paper private-keys are a proof of concept but are widely impractical.  They are promoted here by tinfoil hat types.  If you can't trust keeping your money on your computer you most certainly can't trust it on a piece of paper kept at your house.  If you keep that piece of paper in a safety deposit box then you completely missed the point of not only independence from financial institutions but also the point of a crypto-currency.
