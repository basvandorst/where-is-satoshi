Sold all mine(a few hundred) at $50 to pay for my divorce lawyer.  That one really hurts
@_date: 2011-11-11 02:33:24
wow, thats awesome.  What is your mining setup like?

IVe got about 13 btc, I recently used 8(shipped) to buy 2 lbs of coffee from Bitbrew(which is really good quality, and even with the 3btc shipping still a hell of a good deal.  I will be purchasing btc's to order more coffee from them in the future).
Im using a single 6870 that pulls around 280Mhs plus my work computer with an nvidia card that I let run on the weekends(does about 30mhs).  I usually get around .2 btc/day.

I sold $500 yesterday to a local guy for a 15% markup.  Woke up to see that profit had vanished, just redeposited the money as well, so im hoping for about the same.  Woot
@_date: 2013-02-08 18:31:19
Oh I wish, thats just for a low-mid pricerange pickup.  My jury rigged transducer I generally use for a mandolin wasnt hacking it
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:51:23
Aye, still, is money out of pocket.
I love me my modafinil,  I was bringing it in for myself anyways, its gotten hard to get in Canada so I figured what the hell.  Ive ended up not even selling it, just giving it away at cost to friends.  Actually getting it from a redditor in india, he runs Medsforbitcoin.com

The gambling is going to be the big game changer that adds permanent utilistic value(the other one being the hyperlocal sale of small quantities of illegal drugs by mail).  A lot of americans have had to jump through all sorts of loopholes and what not to play online poker and such, they are going to embrace it with open arms.  Besides, who better then a bunch of chronic gamblers to expose a currency that may or may not have a chance of exponentially increasing in value.

The issue with the way you are trading the USD to bitcoin is that you are the 'local' value of BTC stays the same.  The disparity is in the 2 different 'local' values.  
If anything, the ease in which BTC can be moved, compared the hoops needed to transfer USD-CAD, makes a great case for the value of BTC.
I looked into it a little, and it seems most canadian banks can offer a relatively cheap cross-border account, that counts as a US bank account
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:13:27
They are pretty fantastic in my opinion.  Never any significant delays, all my deposits have been same day(or rushed when I have called and requested).  Ive had no problem receiving money from them either.  Fees are a touch high, but reliable none the less
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:08:04
Hey thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-03-27 08:42:55
I actually made my first localbitcoins.com sale today. Very nice guy, another local IT person,  came to my office, paid cash $500, happily, 15% above mtgox, which was really only 9% above cavirtex.  I would do an e-interac, for whatever the localbitcoin.com price is, plus 18% if you really want.
I misjudged originally, Im actually in Lethbridge, so a local trade is out of order, but e-interact is actually the closest thing to a proper BTC transaction. PM me if you like
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:10:01
The fees make it difficult, and not worth the risk for the percentage of profit to be made
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:25:16
I would totally buy this if in canada
@_date: 2013-02-14 00:43:11
same here
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:37:25
I am a massive fan of the convenience, even over anything Paypal/etc can offer. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:50:02
Yep, I had to liquidate my last 70 or so coins at ~$70 in order to pay for my divorce.  Super not thrilled about that one
@_date: 2013-02-08 02:59:32
Yeah I looked at some of that, Ive been doing my conversions in CAD, and taking into account the commissions.  It would be a small profit, just hate to sit there impotently when there is a $1-1.5 price difference between exchanges for 4-8 hours at a time.
  Its not even much of a matter of actually exchanging it to canadian dollars on a regular basis, more of having *somewhere* i can keep the money that is relatively accessible, without bouncing it around a half dozen shady currency exchangers and the like 
@_date: 2013-04-01 01:46:44
Also, dont forget, everyone had time to meet with family and brag about how well their 'stupid internet ponzi scheme' is doing.
@_date: 2013-01-31 15:46:45
I dont mind so much, it gives everyone a nice opportunity to rehash the "bubble/not bubble" debate, comparing to current events and whatnot
@_date: 2013-02-13 15:49:40
I think he means hes purchased some of the sDice Shares they have put out.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:24:27
I live right by ya.  If I had bought in a few months earlier, I would take you up on it
@_date: 2013-02-08 16:37:31
I dont really do the buy/sell thing with BTC too much, Im trying to hold on/invest as much as I can. I sold about $200 worth a month or so ago, kind of regret it now, but needed the cash(needed an upright bass pickup that didnt sound like a potato, and had a short notice gig). Ive been mining for a while(but not long enough to have made a stupid amount of profit) but  I spend a lot of my BTC on products/services as well, so I like to keep at least a positive BTC cashflow incoming
The kind of trading I want to do is very small % margin, and any profitability will probably be ironed out if BTC gets a little more accepted.  That being said, hate to let a decent opportunity  go to waste.
The fees are what im trying to avoid, they would nickel and dime any profitably out of cross border exchanging 
@_date: 2013-02-13 16:37:31
Im assuming at least a few people involved have also purchased ASIC's(myself included, though not to the $30k mark)
@_date: 2013-06-10 07:18:16
Damn, these guys were nothing but fantastic. 
@_date: 2013-01-31 16:33:02
Hindsights 20/20, though I dont feel nearly as bad as that guy probably does
@_date: 2013-02-07 22:09:11
Im trying specifically to be able to take advantage of the odd times when there are large price discrepancies between the US and CAD exchanges, basically buying cheap btc in one market, transferring it, and cashing out in another
@_date: 2013-02-14 01:05:07
Good lord me too.  This middling semi-traditional schnitzel restaurant in my town sold to a nice family from El Salvador.  Now they sell a mix of Austrian Schnitzels stuffed with cheese, and scratch made pupusas and a bunch of other latin food. Its glorious.
@_date: 2013-01-22 15:33:44
they dont ship to canada, nor do they sell armodafinil :(
@_date: 2013-02-01 16:48:44
I purchased a bunch through them last night as well.  Looks good so far
@_date: 2013-02-13 17:37:18
**D**o look around, the**R**e are quite a n**U**mber of **G**reat vendor**S**.  Coffee, gold/precious metals, lots of electronics, and a ton of different web services
@_date: 2013-01-31 19:58:08
Exactly my point, if people just speculate on them without spending, its worthless, big reason that first big bubble crashed.  That being said, its always nice to come out a little ahead, rather than being the bitcoin equivalent to "[the guys who sold his 10% apple stake for $800](
@_date: 2013-02-14 01:11:35
Dont feel too bad, as of a few minutes ago they were at $22
@_date: 2013-01-22 16:04:47
ah sweet, they do have it, didnt see that.  Still no canuck shipping though :(
@_date: 2013-02-05 18:54:59
I just dumped mine, not a big loss, and didnt have too much, but still, im pretty annoyed
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:35:14
you are still going to need an internet connection at all these locales.  Hell if you need the pcs, just goto the dump, grab some old clunkers, set them up, remove the monitor and go
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:02:06
I was worried it was fendrihan.com for a second.  Bye-Bye all my bitcoins.  Good job either way!
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:38:08
@_date: 2013-02-21 21:43:25
ehgad! You win, by far
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:45:45
I started mining back when BTC was at $2, and invested a good chunk of money as well at various points.  I used a good two-thirds of my BTC for various purchases(25btc for a couple pounds of coffee, at the time, I was getting a hell of a deal.....)  Cashed out most of the rest here and there for financial reasons.  Still holding on to a few as contingency money, but damn, it would have been nice to still have a &gt;100btc balance.  It would have been fantastic to be able to pay off my divorce lawyer with the proceeds of "fake internet money'. Or pay off the lawyer and buy a sick ride as well.
@_date: 2013-02-14 00:53:25
I was going to run by the bank to deposit cash into my exchange, but went and got pupusas instead :( I have made a terrible mistake(though the pupusas were good)
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:22:55
I know what you mean.  My original plan was to buy up Modafinil with BTC and sell it for a mark up locally. By the time the pills get here, they have cost me double
@_date: 2013-02-14 01:31:27
They are these fried corn tortilla thingies stuff with cheese or shredded pork(or both).  Think a mix between a tamale and a grilled cheese sandwich, covered in hotsauce.
@_date: 2013-02-21 17:42:26
I know many bitcoin enthusiasts also have 20/20 hindsight, but seeing that Chromebook for ~6 BTC, and remembering buying a pound of coffee for like 8 BTC, and going "oh only 2.5 bitcoins for shipping? No problem, my computer is printing money!" hurts my heart a little bit.
@_date: 2013-01-22 10:32:12
Yup. My Canadian supplier of armodafonil just dried up. You get me that, rock and roll
@_date: 2013-02-08 02:24:57
Aye, im only looking at it when there is a good 5-10% disparity, and just trade a bit at a profit here and there.  I think that a lot of canadian banks now offer american accounts as well, with relatively free transfer between the too.  Got an appointment with the bank tomorrow to set it up.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:37:53
woohoo thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:46:45
yeah somethings pootched up with the site at the moment it looks like
