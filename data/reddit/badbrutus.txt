IMO transaction  are what really matters in terms of viability as a currency - traders/speculators/investors are pumping up the $ volume now that the price is ramped, but even with those included (which i would assume is the majority of total volume), its still only doing 1% of the number of transactions that paypal does.

yes. short-term capital gains are taxed at income tax rates (vs long term cap gains at discounted rates - 0% or 15% [maybe its 20 now? idk]). losses first offset gains and then can offset up to $3,000 of income.
(again, presuming they are treated like stocks. and presuming i remember things correctly from accounting classes 4 years ago).

that article out lately that i'm sure you've seen (the like "3 charts that shows bitcoin's a bubble") demonstrates the point in the top chart on that - that daily volume as a % of marketcap has cratered as the market cap has increased... meaning that there is less true activity now (as a proportion of the total bitcoin money supply/economy) than before.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:16:12
I've never quite understood this explanation of bitcoin's usefulness: who cares about 3% merchant/money transfer fees. Firstly, credit cards and issuing banks employ tens/hundreds of thousands of people: if the world poofed to all-bitcoin tomorrow, is more unemployment really a fantastic thing? **EDIT: And I know that I value being able to carry around something that represents my entire current/near future purchasing power, without actually having to carry around all that cash, and enjoying the additional protections that it affords against fraud, robbery, etc.**
Secondly, with the tangential thought that business/institutions are inherently greedy, why won't most merchants just keep the 3% saved as profit versus passing it along to customers/stakeholders/employees?

it's not their money; it's other people's money. the whole point of VC is to hit it out of the park one out of (10, 20, 50, 100) times to cover the losses of getting it wrong the other 9x% of times.
so they probably don't care too much on a day to day basis.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:17:09
if it works like stocks, generally, you would sell the lower cost-basis coins **IF** you've held for more than a year (which is the threshold for long term capital gains for stocks), or you would sell the higher cost-basis ones if you have held for less than a year.

blackberry had lots of promising news bites too.
i have no skin in the BTC game either way - but just because it went to $1200 doesn't mean its worth $1200. this intangible thing still has a $10b market cap. realistically, at this point in time, it really is just tulips - there's potential for more, much more, but it's fairly useless right now.

storage is easy up to a certain quantity (way more than most people here [other than super early adopters] seem to have tied up in bitcoin). is it really that hard to store a one-ounce gold coin?
division isn't necessary from the **commodity** standpoint. (i think you're encroaching into currency territory here)
transfer - again, relatively infrequent and not that hard. sell on eBay or to a local exchange. yes they'll take a little cut but that's how the world works.

you could (also incorrectly) make the same argument about a company/stock - but you are ignoring the emotional side of valuation. 
Apple is one of the most profitable companies in the history of the world, and 1) it will likely have a larger user base in the future, 2) there are plenty of investor dollars not invested right now, and 3) there are additional end users/uses of apple products, but that does not mean that the stock will go up in the future (and does not somehow invalidate its decline in the past year).
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:48:41
Fair enough, i gues i should have rephrased; i don't feel "taxed" by the system because it provides benefits that i want (security, convenience, liquidity, etc.). But i agree that efficiency should be promoted when there is net benefit.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:22:39
interesting and good point. however, why **should** bitcoin be considered a store of value when so many good (dare i say, better?) stores of value exist? Why wouldn't you prefer to own gold, or a bond from a reliable company, or a dividend paying stock, etc?
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:55:26

you say that as if it's currently seamless to convert btc to usd.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:10:17


wat? i think it's silly to think that the risk/inconvenience of adding btc as a middle step is a much better solution than sucking up a few percent (likely to be minimal, as long as you avoid the most abusive converters like airport stalls) by converting in traditional ways.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:52:32
i mean....... if they deposited money in your account and attempted to withdraw it back relatively quickly after that...... you kind of sound like the scammer. you claim that you realized it was theirs, so why would you purposefully take that account down to 0 unless you were trying to scam them?

agree that dotcom is a better/fair comparison... but the [unanswered] questions is whether bitcoin is pets.com or amazon.
IMHO bitcoins had a lot more utility when they were $1 each and the silk road was up and running - they were actually serving a purposes, and functioning relatively seamlessly, for users that had a specific need.
it now seems like the marginal buyer is a speculator, and despite the increasing adoption by merchants via bitpay (or similar), the true "bitcoin economy" of today is much closer to wall street/a casino than the "main street"-esque economy during silk road days.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:53:19
Bitcoin price just went down from over $1200 to $630 and now sits around $650. That's almost a 50% decrease in a couple of days... what less could you possibly ask for? If you're really unlucky any other investment could lose that in a year or a few years.

i would think of it more along the lines of rent or advertising - you're paying to make your product available.... not to actually process the payments. (this is coming from the perspective of a merchant that does 99% of sales on Amazon... so might have a bit of a different viewpoint.)
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:25:37
if you want to think about it that way, sure, but it's not truly created.
Person A gives bank $30k for a 5 year CD (or has an average $30k in a checking account... pretty much same thing)
Person B gets a $27k 5-years auto loan from bank
so maybe there is temporarily a "created" $27k
But in reality, at the end of 5 years, person A gets their $30k back (with a tiny bit of interest), person B pays off their loan, and the bank makes the spread... there was no new money permanently created in the process.

1. not really 
2. there's been a lot of disappearing bitcoins lately. (sure these weren't stored in a waterproof sealed paper wallet with the key memorized blah blah blah but i think you are worried about the wrong one being shady).


considering that the current marginal buyer is a speculator and that many coins still rest in the hands of original miners, i don't think it's that unfathomable for a run on the bitcoin bank to take things back down to double or single digits.


you say that like there's a guy whose finger is hovering above a "PRINT" button. monetary policy in important economies is run by people way smarter than you (or i) will ever be, all working in tandem with eachother.
