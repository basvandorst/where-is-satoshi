It has been a few years since I have used MySQL, but my experience was that you had to use a lot of API-level stuff to get behavior out of it that you'd just expect from a properly designed RDBMS (This code certainly seems to follow that pattern of manual locking etc.)
The more I think about it, the more I feel like this code is a result of the history of MySQL's inadequacies, and less a programmer who doesn't know what he's doing.

If this is genuinely a question from someone handling financial transactions, then yes, this is abhorrent.  This might not seem like an obvious thing to the casual observer, but this is pretty bad.
Sure, code gets written fast, and maybe not every line of code is "up to snuff" due to time constraints.  But for a guy in this position to NOT KNOW how to address the problem is quite frightening.

How do you know that this is a Bitcoin24 admin?

Could you post some transaction info with timestamps, exchange rates etc.?  I would be interested to see the data.  If it's happening consistently, it should be pretty easy to show.

You really think a secure distributed system that exchanges fiat money for bitcoin can be built in two months?
Feel free to look up this comment in two months and make fun of me if I'm wrong.

Fair enough.
I hate to be Typical Internet Programmer Religion Guy, but when I look at that code, all I can think is "Why do people EVER use MySQL?"
MySQL is a steaming turd.
PostgreSQL for the win.

PostgreSQL is the evolution of inGres: 1982
MySQL 2001:
I don't want to get into a religious thing here, so I'm respectfully bowing out of this aspect of the discussion.

5 transactions per second isn't an edge case.
