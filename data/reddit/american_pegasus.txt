Hey, I tried to post quality content, okay?

He's an idiot to use an online wallet. Might as well hand it to me, and I'll keep it from him.

Your money is lost. Such is the life in bitcoin. If the user fails to secure his own wallet, it is his fault.
@_date: 2014-12-10 09:47:51
LOL. You think using an online wallet is a good idea?
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:54:04
Yeah, gambling, buying drugs and speculations. That's all it's good for.

The sound of that troll call is irresistible

I won't be happy, and I'm sure many others in this sub won't be happy too. We need bitcoin to return to $1000 again.

Oops I thought you were someone else. Just realised you're the OP.
Sorry about your loss, mate. Just don't use any online wallet *ever*, or you'd find yourself in the situation you're in now. Nothing can be done to recover those BTCs now. Complaining about it won't help.

Nobody develops any killer apps for litecoin. In fact, few people actually develop anything at all.

You can post this in too. A lot of newcomers there seem like they don't know this piece of history behind the coin.

LOL this is the default mantra of litecoiners: "there's too much invested in LTC already for it to fail". We are seeing how well it works now with the tanking price There's basically *nothing* that appeals about LItecoin at all. It's squeezed from the top by bitcoin and from the bottom by hundreds of alts.

Buttcoiners (mostly) don't hate bitcoin. We are current or ex-bitcoiners who refuse to subscribe to the groupthink so prevalent in this sub.
Either that, or for the comedy value.

I think the explosion in practical AI/machine learning methods we've been seeing over the past decades are more significant than that. Can't tell for sure whether cryptocurrency will be a big thing or just a curious note in the history of tech.
