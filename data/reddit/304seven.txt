This correction was new people who joined and didn't see the gains they expect, so they left, and it trickled down. There is still at least 8k of speculation $/coin that will bolt if they don't see massive returns soon...once it drops to 6k the long-term holders will start to leave, regretting not selling when it was 8k and knowing it's dying - until it eventually reaches a reasonable price ($1k or less) and stabilizes, finally being a practical form of currency.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:04:37
That's called an overpriced burger. Gas is a much better example, that's why I used it. Stick to adding 20% of the bill to your minimum hourly wage.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:51:41
You mean bitcoin, the "currency of the future", is worthless if you are trying to buy something real like a house? Maybe they'll start selling houses on overstock.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:46:33
It will be usable as a currency once the price stabilizes...problem is the price will stabilize so low that most of the owners will sell because they are in it for profits. Also, when I say "usable" I mean accepted, it will never be easier than just using REAL money.

@_date: 2017-12-08 02:14:41
What is something that can only be used as a currency on overstock worth? It was overpriced at $3k, and since then the only people buying were those looking for gains - so when the gains stop, they don't "hodl" they SELL. Big crash for a GIANT inflated bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:25:28
Once it corrects none of this will matter.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:43:56
When the only reason people are buying it is for quick and BIG gains sideways trading or even small (stock market level) gains are going to make them exit. Bad thing is 95% of the market is in it for this purpose, so once it quits gaining it will drop - there is no way bitcoin can keep a steady value.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:41:50
So bitcoin is not a bubble even though most of the people are investing in it ONLY to gain money because of Venezuelan inflation? Makes sense.

"We're" are only people who invested at the beginning of the month. Don't know if you noticed, but this is the mania phase of the bubble and a whole lot of people are stuck or already sold for a loss right now.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:06:56
Another sign we're in the midst of a bubble. I CAN'T WAIT to read all the posts of people crying about how much debt their in or how they lost their life savings doing stupid shit like this. I guess it doesn't matter if you are in debt thousands of USD since bitcoin is the currency of the future though, right? You might owe BoA 12k but you have 3/4 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:04:48
You know inflation is relative, right? Gas was 0.33 50 years ago and it's about $3 now, so with that calculation the dollar is down about 20% in 50 years...bitcoin often loses 20% in a matter of hours.
Can't expect a bartender to be good at math...or anything other than filling a 16 oz glass for that matter.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:47:10
If the coin price varies from minute to minute it is not practical, but thanks for bringing up the transaction fees which make it much less practical than using real $ (on top of the volatile value).

Bitcoin investment experts lol. People will have the ability to bet against bitcoin in an unregulated market where they can alter the price...what do you think will happen? As for the guy thinking traders will hedge bitcoin, remember Wall Street believes (rightly so) that bitcoin is a giant bubble waiting to burst, I don't think they would wait until now to buy into it going UP when they could have done that on their own before.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:42:55
That finite supply of bitcoin is really enticing...until you realize that there will be endless forks, oh ya, AND endless amounts of other cryptocurrencies that serve the same purpose and do it more efficiently. Bubble bubble bubble

@_date: 2017-12-02 03:42:56
You realize any percentage of a coin would show the same gains/losses, right? I mean if idiots want to invest 100 to make money they haven't considered that if it goes to 100k they'll only have $1k. Odds are A LOT higher that you lose half or more of your money than 10x in a reasonable amount of time. OH NEVERMIND IT'S UP 10X THIS YEAR! THAT'S THE STANDARD. IT'LL BE TO A BILLLLLION IN 5 YEARS!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:34:38
If you're looking for gains and don't have $100k to invest it's not really worth it. If you wanna be cool and buy your $1.50 coffee with bitcoin then pay $5 in fees, go for it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:30:56
No moron, as opposed to when it's low and rising. But yes, buying when it's high is also a bad idea, especially since it's 8k over the value before the mania started.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:26:57
That's a really cheap house, if you can't afford it you should probably quit gambling on bitcoin. Congrats on thinking money is the key to being a good father though.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:30:45
Can't wait to read the stories of all the hypothetical millionaires that "hodl" their way back down to 10% of the current price.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:24:12
It always means it's going to turn around when Wall Street is pumping prior to their chance to short. Probably won't be the case once they can profit off a crash.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:33:21
That's how speculation bubbles work. Price stability is the worst possible thing for bitcoin, whether it's at $100 or $1M because 95% of more of the owners bought it as a stock. It is a inefficient payment source which requires extra steps AND more fees to do the same thing that real money does. It's only a valid "store of value" because the price is rising. When the price stabilizes it won't be for long because that's when there will be a massive sell off.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:59:40
You mean that fraudulent "fiat" money that is the sole reason bitcoin has any value?
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:37:45
I think you mean hypothetical trillionaires. Fact is, you can have 100k coins but you still have to convert it to real $ for it to be of any use...unless you REALLY like shopping overstock dot com.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:12:05
Stupid people are thinking it's an easy way to make $ and haven't figured out that it's unusable except as a stock.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:11:46
You're missing the fact that there are an infinite amount of other cryptocurrencies that are the same thing that can be created out of thin air. Not to mention bch and other offshoots of btc. Also, for the record, gold, silver, oil all have a finite supply.

Congrats on not recognizing it was ridiculously overpriced at 19k and losing 25% of your profits. A for-real congrats on realizing it is still really overpriced and getting out before it crashes back down to 1k.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:16:02
Get out now. Value's up roughly $6k from the Wall Street pump before they short it and it's AT LEAST another $6k overvalued after you subtract that.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:31:47
It's doing a pretty good job without being outlawed, by the time they outlaw it 95% of the value will already be gone.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:45:40
Tell that to the people who decided to store at 18k. Anybody that thinks some imaginary "currency" made out of thin air by a bunch of nerds is a good investment deserves to lose all of their $.

@_date: 2017-12-17 04:27:15
It's going to crash to $100 after it quits gaining and the people left holding it realize it's useless...after the masses know it's useless if it's not making money as a stock it will never go back up.

You realize not everyone bought in at the beginning of the year?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:39
Bitcoin is such a good investment. "Fiat" is so volatile, it loses 1-2% in value every year! Bitcoin would never drop it's value like that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:38:17
Sounds good! This bubble is at an all-time high, seems like a GREAT time to put your life savings into it, ESPECIALLY since it's an unregulated market in which BIG MONEY traders are just about to have the option to bet on it's demise.

So you really think in 4 years real money won't matter? In 2022 you STILL won't be able to use bitcoin on amazon (just an example of a merchant that matters)...UNLESS the price has stabilized - but if the price stabilizes, bitcoin will lose 95% or more of it's value since that percentage of people only own it for gains. So yeah, think of how awesome it will be in 2022 with your massive amount of bitcoins that you should have cashed in a week ago.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:41:29

When people talk about buying a "currency" so they can make money when the value of it goes up, I wouldn't consider that adoption. Adoption of bitcoin would be if people actually started using it as a currency, not a stock. It is useless as a currency, which is what it "is".

No more talk of dips, now the only thing it has left to do is crash.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:38:42
If bitcoin is money, how many of you would be happy if the price locked in where it was at and you could no longer exchange it for "fiat"? Buy stuff that has bitcoin as an available payment method only, that means no more Lambos. It's not money, it's a money-trading system. It may be widely accepted one day and be on the same level as "fiat", but until you can buy a house with un-converted bitcoins, it's NOT money. It's blowing up right now with investors that have no intention of ever using it as a currency.
That said, I believe in it long (LONG) term, and I am wiating to buy when the crash happens.
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:36:48
Does gold claim to be a currency? "See yourself out." Nice try on making a point though.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:28:41
You should probably invest in something that isn't a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:51:49
It's pointless, which is why bitcoin will collapse soon. Only worth investing if you have $100k (arguably needs to be more like 250-500).
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:49:26
We're not in an adoption phase, as no one actually uses it as a currency. We're in the rising-stock-bubble phase where everyone thinks it's an easy way to make money. Then we hit the reality phase where everyone realizes that it is useless if it isn't gaining money and the price drops back down...drastically.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:31:35
No. But go ahead and listen to the people who have purchased 4 things in their life with btc which was immediately converted into REAL money by the seller tell you that it's the future of money.

The best part of the story is yet to happen. All of the people that bought in at 10k and lost 90% of their money and all the retards that could have been millionaires screaming TO THE MOON that end up holding a bunch of useless internet "money".
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:32:33
Peer to peer CURRENCY? This is a stock. It's useless as a currency, and always will be due to slow transaction times and high fees. Bitcoin will NEVER replace real money, it has no value without real money backing it. You're a fucking moron. Take off your moon glasses and you'll see a clear silhouette of a giant bubble. It's a hot stock that is useless for anything other than gaining money until people realize you can't buy anything that isn't on overstock with it. Don't try to justify your $100 investment you made 5 days ago.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:09:33
It's because you're paying to convert a stock into currency.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:24:20
Exactly. A stock with no use except gains for investors. I wonder what will happen when the 95-99% of people that buy bitcoin with no intention of using it, only making money, no longer make money off their investment?
Crash. They know it's useless except as a stock. When that stock no longer shows significant gains, everybody sells because there is no reason to have btc unless it's gaining in value...well unless you love overstock and like the extra steps to buy stuff instead of just using REAL money.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:24:28
Congrats, if hell freezes over and btc hits $100k/coin you'll be able to retire and buy an island with that 1,000 bucks.

Not worth it. The bitcoin bubble is so inflated it has pushed out all small investors (probably 75% of people interested). Don't worry, the bubble will pop soon and we'll be back to around $3k.

Jokes on you when the bubble pops and you lose 31k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:58:02
How is it not true? People buy bitcoin for the gains (it's nothing but a hyper-volatile stock). Just like the OP said, there's no point in buying a small fraction of bitcoin at 10k/coin. Buy $100 worth so if the price reaches $100k/coin you can have $1000 dollars? There's no point. If 900 extra bucks is a significant amount of money to you, it's not worth risking 100 in that scenario as the odds of reaching $100k in any reasonable amount of time is significantly less than 9-1.
So yeah, you're right, you can buy fractions - and most people own fractions...that they bought when the price wasn't hyper-inflated. The risk/reward of buying anything less than 10 coins (more like 25-50 coins) is heavily weighted towards risk at this price.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:13:13
"The future of money" lol. What a joke.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:12:10
There's a limited amount of bitcoin...but an infinite amount of other cryptocurrencies that do the exact same thing (and most of which do it better).
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:18:27
Ok. So if 1 btc = $1M and you invest $100 bucks right now you end up with less than $10k. Probably a 1,000-1 shot (at best) that 1 btc = 1 million bucks, and you're only getting 100-1 on your money. My point still stands. You should stay away from casinos.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:41:22
No, they just think it's an easy way to make (REAL) $. When the gains go away, the value goes away because there is no use for bitcoin except to buy it and sell it later for a profit. So yeah, you're right, they don't give a shit about a "currency" they're investing in a stock.
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:29:46
You realize the "majority" that is getting into it now is in it for the gains, no other reason. If they invested at 6k and it drops to 4k, they'll sell. If they invested in 6k and it goes to 12k then doesn't rise for x amount of time, they'll sell. The "majority" isn't buying a currency, they're buying a stock, and when that stock fails to be profitable they'll bail. We don't need another currency anyway, bitcoin just adds extra steps when compared to using REAL money.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:01:47
I think the battle is actually making bitcoin useful as anything other than a stock. Gonna be a loooooooong time before it's a currency, and by that time it will be worth as much as litecoin is worth right now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:27:00
Converting REAL $ (from a bank) to bitcoin sure seems like an extra step. And there aren't many options for buying things straight from bitcoin. It's completely ridiculous to buy anything with bitcoin when it's 100x easier just to use REAL $.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:36:31
Well that changes everything. That means there are almost as many places you can use bitcoin as REAL money.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:02:13
Well a good start is to decide to buy at ~90% of the all-time high of a bubble stock...seems like you've got that part down.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:57:11
So your plan is to give homeless people "money" that they can't use anywhere. Good idea bro.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:59:55

That tends to happen when you invest in something @ 90% of it's ATH.
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:11:12
So you bought at about 85% of the ATH price? In general, not a very good idea. More so in a market as volatile as BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:21:09
...and 1 btc is worth about 43% of what you paid for it if you bought a little over a month ago.

@_date: 2017-09-24 15:43:29
"Simple" because bitcoin has had a good year and "fiat" has had a bad year. I think you're forgetting bitcoin's ONLY value is how much it is worth in REAL money. Imagine if you invested your net worth in bitcoin @ $4,900, not such a great idea then is it? If you think "fiat" is dying a slow death, then so is crypto. If bitcoin had no REAL money value it would be useless...unless you plan to live your life with overstock purchases.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:10:13
Everyone talks about "fiat" declining in value, 1-2%/yr usually...but if you have your net worth in crypto, it can decline in value 25% in a day. So which would you think is safer to store?

No, which is exactly why bitcoin will never be used as a legitimate currency.
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:53:51
I think it will go down, but not until the Chinese pump it enough to make a good profit off of it. Any coins you bought at 3k should be sold a few days before their trading gets banned (I forget the date right now). The Chinese correction is coming.

If bitcoin is such a great commodity that will only go up in value, why would you spend it? Getting 15% off is great until BTC goes up 30% and you just spent 115% of the value for the item. Morons.

Or in instant 10x ROI. Thanks for the feedback, seems like you're saying this kind of order will work if someone messes up their sell order.
@_date: 2017-09-09 06:52:53
You were wrong and got called out. Don't get technical to try to make yourself right. Nobody in investments considers 3 days/weeks/months/OR years an "early" retirement...also, 95k would only be a 3 year early retirement if he is working at McDonald's or Walmart, so you have once again made a moot point.

I had buy orders at 4k that I canceled when it was 4025 because I feel the same way...I don't know about 1k, but my gut told me 4k wasn't as good of a deal as it looked a couple weeks ago. Once it gets down to about 2500 we'll see if all the hands of the hodlers during the "dip" to 4300 are as strong as they said they were.

The fastest way is to convert it to real money and then use your debit card or cash.

Now is a better time to sell than in a week, and last week was a better time to sell than now. Go ahead and hodl and enjoy the year-long ride waiting for it to climb from 2200 back to your buy-in price.

Remember the "huge support" also coincided with the news that the Chinese had another month and a half to trade, the support at 3k might not be as strong without all of those buys and the stars aligning...

They already had their money on there. They were given until Oct 30 to cash out. The Chinese whales have been pumping the price since 10 minutes after the news they had until Oct 30 to cash out was released.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:20:02
This is the biggest pump &amp; dump in the history of bitcoin. Expect sub-3k after the Chinese can no longer trade, probably 7k before they sell everything off.

The Chinese went from thinking they were banned to having until Oct 30th to trade. Day of that news = +30%. They're currently pumping before they dump and can't trade anymore. Common sense.

Wait for the China sell-off. About a month away.
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:43:56
If you're happy with ~4,500/coin, sell now. If you want to hold on for at least 6 more months waiting for it to get back to 5k, hold. If you are interested in buying the upcoming correction, sell and buy-back in then wait 6 months for it to climb to 5k+ and profit again.

Bitcoin is such a scarce commodity, only 21M will ever exist! There will be 72,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 other crypto-coins that are exactly the same but with a different name, but bitcoin is SO SCARCE it's value will never decrease.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:30:27
That tends to happen when you invest in something @ 90% of it's ATH.
@_date: 2017-09-12 05:51:50
You could easily dump chunks of 100-200 at a time by selling slightly below current value. If you look on gdax there are usually buy orders for 100+ @ 4100 when it's at 4300. You'd lose a little bit of value per coin, but honestly, who gives a fuck if you lose a couple of your 1,000 millions to get real money instead of hypothetical money.
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:19:44
"The future of currency" lol. This is why bitcoin is nothing more than an internet stock.
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:48:32
Just because they have more registered users doesn't mean they are all actively trading, or even purchasing. I'd guess over 50% of the new users haven't made a purchase yet, either waiting for the price to drop to purchase or just setting up an account so it's ready if/when they are ready to buy.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:36:52

Nobody is going to buy anything with bitcoin when the price fluctuates this much. Sellers are afraid the price will drop, buyers are afraid the price will rise.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:31:26
It's because all of the people here only make predictions that bitcoin will never drop and they feel like idiots when it does.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:51:14
So, if "fiat" is gone and a bitcoin will be worth 999 quadtrillion of all the current currencies, you are predicting bitcoin will be worth nothing. Correct.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:53:46
It's not the month low, it's the current low. It will go much lower. Get out and buy back in.
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:48:01

You lost me at "fast working". Imagine the line at Starbucks if they only accepted bitcoin and everybody had to wait 15 minutes for their transfers to go through. They have these things called debit and credit cards that actually work fast and you don't have to worry about your $3.75 latte costing $375 in the future and Starbucks doesn't have to worry about selling it for $0.25 in the future. Keep dreaming though dude.

@_date: 2017-10-14 07:50:49
People invest in bitcoin so when it's value rises they can convert it back to REAL money that's useful.
With bitcoin you can buy whatever you need as long as it's on overstock or a very small number of other sellers that accept bitcoin. With REAL money you can buy anything you want from any person.
Good enough for you?

The fact there are many things you CAN'T buy with bitcoin makes it hypothetical.
If I have a billion dollar baseball card collection, that's cool &amp; I can feel rich, but unless I exchange the baseball cards for "fiat" they're worthless. You can't go buy a house with 1000 packs of baseball cards, and you can't go buy a house with 1000 bitcoins. Bitcoin is the definition of hypothetical money, they track the value of a bitcoin by how much it is worth in "fiat". Maybe one day it will be the real deal, but as of now, unless you can buy everything you need from overstock, you have to convert bitcoin or you just have an expensive stack of baseball cards. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:54:07
Really? An early retirement off of a $400 investment? Even if bitcoin hits 1M/coin that's only 95k, not exactly a retirement fund, definitely wouldn't qualify as "plenty of time" money. Amazing how delusional some of you people are when it comes to btc.

They want a more stable source of cryptocurrency. If a country owes them $100M, pays in btc, and the price halves (which it very well could), they now settled for half of the original value. Even if they immediately converted it to local currency...well, bitcoin just adds a pointless conversion in that case.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:45:41
The price is still being pumped by the Chinese. Bitcoin will fall like a shitbrick from an airplane as they sell off right before Oct 30th.

@_date: 2017-10-13 05:21:17
We'll see how cheap they are when people realize it's a stock pretending to be a currency. Everything now is a media-induced hype-purchase, when btc gains 5% in a year instead of 400% or (more likely) drops as people find out they're investing in a currency that you can't actually use to buy stuff people will be BEGGING buyers to pay $1k/coin.
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:58:14
Buying at 99% of an all-time high price is always a good idea, according to everyone here. Probably shoulda waited for all the Chinese to dump before Oct 30.
