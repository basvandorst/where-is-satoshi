2) They will build the most powerful mining network in the world.

Yeah, it's funny how things work out sometimes. I also waited until everything was in place and I knew how to use it. Never left my bitcoin on an exchange. Delayed withdraws from any of them immediately raise my warning flag. But the Yubikey, in the case of MtGox was false security.

This is super bullish but watch out. These big players will likely take over the market and force the little guys out. For example, someone buys a million worth of BTC OTC \(Circle or Gemini\) and sells a tenth of it at the market on an exchange like Kraken. The price is going to dip. Buying similar amounts will cause a jump. Some people will get tired of this and sell out. Have you noticed the Bart Simpson effect recently? Just hold and watch.

Thanks for the heads up. Unfortunately, Google only gives us (the people who originated the data) relative results so it's only comparable to itself over time and among other searches. I didn't have any luck using Baidu, unfortunately. 
So, the Chinese search results are probably from non-mainland sources. The other language results may also be skewed due to more popular services in those countries. 
In any case, there's a recent uptrend in Japan and Korea.

I totally agree. Coins are best held in your possession with most in cold storage. No trader should rely on a single exchange (lessons on this have more or less been continuously on offer since the beginning). But, to get started, many people need a simple direct approach. Once a person has some bitcoin, the incentive to read and learn will increase in proportion to the market price.
My experience? I probably spent a month studying everything I could get my hands on in early 2011 before I bought coins. Hmm, where you ask? Mt. Gox, of course! But my cold wallets (dedicated USBs) were ready and ended up saving my butt.

I'd say this will have a visible impact on the bitcoin price. Stores and customers alike will need a certain amount to bitcoin to prime the system. What would you keep in your daily shopping bitcoin wallet? $100, $200? If there's 100K outlets then there will be some multiple of that as customers. Antoher factor will be popularity, which depends on press treatment and perceived benefit. Hopefully, since BITPoint seems to be a progressive company, ease of use will not be a issue.

Ten years is a long time in this game. I'd say multiple diversifications (re-distributions is the way I think about it) along the way will be needed.

Studying the Fed and what it has wrought is a good investment of time for those interested in replacing it. I spend more and more time on this topic. Are we prepared to answer questions like: 1) Can an autonomous system fueled by a fixed 21 million units of value really back a nation-sized economy? 2) Can this autonomous system be ready by the time the current system collapses? 3) Will Bitcoin (for example) be allowed to exist as a useful parallel system as a means to prove its functionality? 4) How likely is a Bitcoin enabled world-wide 'black economy' to come into being and would it be able to continue to interface with the legacy economies? In another environment, I could not envision studying the Fed as the least bit interesting. There's going to be fireworks in our future and they'll undoubtedly make the current situation seem like so many sparklers.
