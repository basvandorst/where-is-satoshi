Interestingly core has a lower percentage of anonymous miners

Yeah! They're marketing the coin as the coin for the "unbanked" and the everyman, yet its highly centralized, and the average transaction  is around $88,000.

Hypothetically if the hashpower is controlled by Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, or other pool owners, that would be enough power to easily 51% attack/hard-fork again.

I'll upvote you out of simple respect for discussion. If you're new to bitcoin I understand your optimism, but I just don't see the volume for this to be a real bull market.

Nah this analysis is straight up willful and pointless, we're about to get the "Wall Street is buying in" pump and it won't last past 12k.

I don't ever want to have the following conversation with any merchant, anywhere:
"Merchant should say “hey, I’ll let you send me a 0conf, with at least X fee, and if that’s not enough I’ll pay another X+Y to cpfp-it”. And the user should take that, but otherwise the default should be rbf"
@_date: 2016-03-08 22:46:14
I am still not understanding sidechains fully. What would happen if the merchant accepts bitcoin, and the customer wants to use Lightning?
@_date: 2016-03-31 01:30:34
I think he's saying with how payment channels are set up, running a channel would generate fees and require an un-moving quantity of coins. My understanding is that larger contracts with more money stored will be seen as more trustworthy channels to use, and thus they will generate more fees simply by having this "stake" of parked coins that must remain unmoved to maximize trust and profit.

LN can be centralized or not, which is why I used the example of companies opting to use it. You do not have to use LN, or even acknowledge it, and can keep using reliable 0 confirmation transactions on main chain without issue. All I am saying is that it will unclutter the main blockchain. I also want a block size increase and think its ridiculous that the bitcoin core team hasn't agreed to this yet.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:43:27
Yes, isn't that the whole point of segwit? No transaction malleability means that off-chain contracts can be secure, and new technologies can be built on bitcoin to better serve those who serve the community? If i owned a large exchange, I'd use LN to manage my accounts on the back-end, making more trustless and secure exchanges a reality. Segwit and LN in theory will enable more ideas like bitsquare to take off.

Nah if I have a long term payment channel open, say .05 bitcoin, that spending power goes up when price of btc goes up. I’m not going to put t back on the main chain just because the price went up, am I?

Traders already use reinforcement learning to learn what reinforcement learning learns so they can trade against reinforcement learning. Just buy the bottom and hold, day trading isn’t worth the capital gain tax risks, IMO.

3-4k is the 23% fibonacci level, which every bubble dropped down to so yes expect 3-4k bitcoin and even more decimated alts.

We would have greater problems if the worlds electricity and/or internet access suddenly shut off, which is the only way that scenario could play out.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:56:09
You cant buy coffee with gold but it still is worth more than some alts! value isn't singularly in the use case, and since its digital, in a few years, the blocksize could finally get raised and guess what, i'll still be holding bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:28:50
To answer your **question,** yes it would be more decentralized but probably not more robust because you do not need to run a full node to be a miner.

Try Scrypt mining at multipool.us. You won’t earn much but coins other than ₿ have much cheaper transaction fees and you might earn a couple cents, which could turn into many cents some day.
