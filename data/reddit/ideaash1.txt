Another thing you forgot to mention was taxes.  Assuming your bitcoin value has appreciated, do you need to pay capital gain on every transaction? 
Imagine buying a sandwich and  paying 5 $ in BTC, Do I need to file tax returns for that?

How much does it cost in commission for one round transaction?
i.e USD to BTC and back to USD. 
Or, assuming the value BTC does not change during this process,  If I buy 1000 $ worth BTC and cash it back to USD at the same ATM, how much USD will I get?

Exactly, I know how CG and CL works. And if we have to calculate CG/CL for every transaction and file tax returns, I would go insane.

It would really be nice when you log into to CB if it shows BCH as a separate line item, even if you cannot do anything with it until Jan 1st.

Are you sure of this? It would be nice if they show BCH as a separate line item even if you cannot do anything with it.  This way even if you move BTC it will still show you have BCH until Jan 1st.

What is a good website where you can track your crypto portfolio, like good old yahoo finance for stock? When I search for it I get inundated with apps like this, I do not care enough about it to have it on my phone as an App.

When people call someone a Whale here on reddit, how many coins do they own.

Does that mean if there is no capital gain if Bitcoin's appreciate? 
If you buy 100 bitcoins now, if the value doubles against the $, and use bitcoins to buy something at 1/2 the price in $, is there a capital gains on that transaction?

When you say "It might take a month before you can do "instant" transactions" how much time does it take after I open an account, give them checking account info, to make the first transaction with coinbase?
I am not interested in trading, meaning, once I set it up, make my first purchase, I am not in a hurry to sell BTC and convert it back into USD and deposit it into my bank account.  I don't want to setup my account now and wait a month to make my first purchase.

I live in US and have a bank account here, What should I use? I am leaning towards coinbase.
