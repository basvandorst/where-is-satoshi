If you don't want to use the authy code then you have another option. Just choose the link right by the empty box for the authy code (on website)... choose any of the other options such as sms or phone call from coinbase.

I think back to 120 man. I was pissed I hadn't bought at 90. Same thing at 175. I was pissed at how expensive it was. Same at 225. After that I understood.  It's the product. It's solid and still far far underexposed to its market.

After a high of 1200 I don't think high 7 ' s and low 8 ' s are bad at all.  I'm biased.  I'm in it for the long term... I think there's a good chance we'll never ever see 500 again. BTC has proved to be very very resilient against bad news and rumors or speculation bad news.

mBTC is essentially the same idea yes?

Wallets on your hard drive monitor your address on the blockchain. There's no BTC on your hard drive at all... just an address and your private key.

I'll buy that vowel for ... 1 BTC.

When you brought up the sister I thought the story would get interesting.

This is fun to watch.

Who cares if they panic sell? 1) It won't affect BitCoin in terms of it sticking around and 2) You and I can get more Cheap!!!

No idea what the hell you're talking about. Know what I mean?
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:20:01
I asked myself the same thing at 50, 75, 120, 175, 225, 875... answer for *me* was yes. Im not wealthy at all! It's an idea and implementation that makes sense at any price. For you? Who knows.

Those two points were very gentle critiques and cautions. Credit cards,  speculators,  hedge funds, outright scams, ... We've seen this before - with USD. Crypto is more than *money* ... it's freedom from not just banks but old ways of thinking and doing business... and here we have the irony of CoinBase accepting the very credit cards they would argue that BTC should potentially replace (cheaper fees).  
The piece on exchanges running off is badly written. My caution for us is to try and mitigate scams to the extent we can... no connection to CoinBase.

What sound does Bitcoin make in a pocket?

What I mean by humans are always rationally irrational is that although from my (our) perspective something seems irrational and illogical, it actually makes perfect sense to the person making a dumb decision. Here's an easy example: Prisons are full of people who have done things they regret and that have caused tremendous damage.  If you ask the person *why* quite often they'll tell you it was a "poor choice" or a "dumb decision" or "it seemed like a good idea at the time".  Dumb decisions are not irrational. They are very rational.  In the case of Bitcoin IF we can assume that people have basic math skills then what they are objecting to in terms of not wanting to buy regular Bitcoin is not irrational but a  *preference* ... preference suggests marketing as a solution. Marketing implies style over substance... which brings us full circle to mBTC as a solution. If mBTC *looks* better to a consumer... then it IS better.  Let's use whatever it takes.

I love fuzzy phone cam photos... said no one ever :)
@_date: 2014-01-01 18:58:06
What you may not appreciate is social psychology. Marketing IS important. Many studies show the importance of price display.  That's not a made up phenomenon.  I think this idea should be considered... right beside mBTC.  Debate is good. In the end what's most interesting to me is who decides? That's one problem with decentralization.

First thing that absolutely has to happen is price stability. If and when that happens. BTC looks a bunch more attractive overnight... the conditions you speak of would happen naturally and easily.
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:50:05
Might as well "guarantee" (insure) funds can't be stolen like one of your competitors. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:29:07
Don't worry about "haters" ... those types will always exist.  BTC keeps proving them wrong. In fact a long time ago May 2013 I had just started learning about BTC and speculating on the price. The so called "crashes" and "bubbles" are more aptly suited for the traditional stock markets. BTC is something else entirely. Altogether different phenomenon.

Just some thoughts: 
1) You sound like you work for CoinKite.  I'm sorry it's just a thought - don't strangle me...yet.  
2) Did you stop to think that CoinKite is probably great b/c they're not that busy? What do you think will happen if (theoretically) everyone moved over to them? 
3) Offline storage is an awesome idea on CoinBase's part. ANY IT connected to the internet is vulnerable.  You sound ridiculous suggesting anything else... again just my thoughts.  
4) If customers lean on CoinBase for LTC they'll do it.  I think.
5) You sound like you work for CoinKite.
@_date: 2014-01-03 01:46:35
Lol. I wish I owned *stock* in CoinBase... BTC will make due :-)

Don't take my word for it. Look at the results. The public ain't getting it... clearly!
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:38:08
I'm with you. Full steam ahead. We'll have some casualties along the way. Mr Exploited and Ms Powerless will get scammed by corporate interests. There's no doubt in my mind high fees and group sign ups for those w no internet will plague those that rush in to the newest fad. Like I said... a gentle critique. We've seen this kinda thing play out before with high interest loans and the like. Then we get far down the road and say *how the heck did that happen?* We looked the other way... that's how.  Thanks for the question and I hope I answered it sufficiently. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:24:04
Show it.
@_date: 2014-01-01 19:00:43
Your argument is well thought out.  Often we don't see that.  I'm following the debate below.  It appears to be similar to mBTC.

It's true that he doesn't know. It's also true that it's certainly possible.  He just should have worded it differently.  China's govt is very corrupt. You think they don't see what's going on?
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:50:07
Think more broadly batman. CoinBase could capitalize on consumer unease (fear).  That always works.  And in this case it's true.  I'm uneasy (fearful).  Since I'm a guy uneasy is easier to swallow.
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:52:11
Simple reason.  Corporations run Congress via Lobbyists. Duh.

Could be an amazing opportunity for an insurer.  Getting premiums with almost zero chance of a theft.  Heck spread the risk and allow BTC investors themselves.  TIE and Synch the insurance into the blockchain and Coinbase so as to catch the thief if funds were ever stolen.  Frankly I think only the most savvy of users would be able to demonstrate they were hacked.
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:50:44
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:46:37
Agreed it would be difficult to "prove". Bravo for asking.  I'm assuming that Coinbase's innovation and foresight are already industry leading. I have to assume they will figure out some protocol to help demonstrate that a user's coins have indeed been "stolen".  I mean truthfully I believe only half the stories of "stolen" coins.  Who's to say you and a buddy didn't agree to "steal" your coins? Good question.
