Yes, why do you think it crashed from 20k? Because Chicago exchange started offering this.

There is a big difference between a appreciating asset a depreciating one. This is a ridiculous comparison.

Great unbiased opinion. In other news, Trump said his tax cuts will make America great again.

It's 8 years old and as a payment method "it's original intended purpose" it's terrible.

Just the rich. We'll be just like Mexico in 10 years

Seriously, bitcoin is becoming the new vegan.
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:51:37
The technology is exciting, that doesn't make bitcoins any more valuable? Do you understand the difference in the technology and actual bitcoins? 
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:11:03
Seriously?

He's a criminal. Supporting him is like republicans supporting Trump.

Plebes, such irony

Can you tell us your setup?

If you look at coinbase subreddit there are several others that had their accounts closed for no reason in past 24 hours.
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:01:39
Please, for your own good, stop. It's hasn't hit bottom.

Yes, but making opiates readily available on the internet enables many more people to get addicted and then invariably lose self control and end up doing horrible things had they never fell into addiction they never would have done. Addiction destroys even the best of people. This is why we regulate dangerous drugs. And yes marijuana should be legal. But opiates are destroying our country. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:50:06
You act like they were only selling weed. Opiates destroy lives.

Oh you believe him? Why didn't you say so. That changes everything.

Tell that to their children they abandon and neglect. Or their parent they steal from.

I like bitcoin and I'm familiar with this case which leaves this post feeling like it belongs in the subreddit "the Donald". You can support bitcoin and still be rational amd objective. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:06:51
Not an accurate comparison. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:10:12
Now that's a statement of an addict. Get some help. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:48:13
Thank you. So nice to see some rational comments.

TRT does wonders.

I like bitcoin as much as everyone else, but lets be honest, stocks have tangible value as a company is backing them that ha little chance of suddenly failing. As much as I want bitcoin to succeed as a currency its still very much speculative and I think sometimes we lose sight of that. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:23:32
To add to this "stole" is not the correct word.

Coinbase is terrible. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:04:28
How is that possible? 
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:48:36
It was only like $6 but still $400 vs 400 million and they paid less, lol
@_date: 2018-07-30 04:35:16
I live in Houston if you want to back it up otherwise stfu internet warrior. Go back to your basement.

Shit like this is why bitcoin gets no respect. Your the bitcoin equivalent of Peta. You're hurting the cause.

Appreciate the response, and I signed up for your service, but I've always read many of the unused gift cards are simply forgotten or lost and the company keeps the profit from the unused cards? Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2016-07-26 06:24:19
It didn't go up before the halving? I feel like the price increase already happened in anticipation of it.
