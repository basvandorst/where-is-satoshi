I get what you're saying, it's possible Belfort changed (doubtful.)
But also, if you don't judge someone by their past actions, that's how you end up with the Jordan Belfort of Presidents.

I checked it out, I don't know a lot about exchanges but it doesn't seem all that special.

Am I the only one who saw the US draft legislation that would impact cryptocurrencies?
Edit: It was published on congress.gov or wherever they publish bills that have been introduced, I believe it was discussed twice and approved for committee review.
