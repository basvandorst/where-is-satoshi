It's a gamble at this point IMO. Bitcoin needs to fix their scaling issues and be able to handle more than 3 transactions per second (or hit the $840ish support) for me to buy back. 3 transactions per second is literally not enough to support some people's individual ebay stores lol. Not to mention the advantages of speed and low fees I once told people proudly about just a year or two ago are now no longer advantages but disadvantages. We'll see. Too many people here married to the idea that it must be bitcoin which succeeds. I don't buy it. They'll have to prove it to me.

Perhaps it's happened a handful of times with bitcoin, but it's still far from normal as far as trading is concerned.

It screams market manipulation to me...
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:44:56
It probably won't, I really have no idea. It depends how fast the miners sell all the bitcoin they've been hoarding and how the market reacts.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:53:58
The facts are readily available...  
The funny thing about a limit - it limits you. Perhaps the blockchain won't "die". We can speculate on what exactly will happen when 1mb IS the average. Maybe a significant amount of people will lose trust and the network will reach an equilibrium while other networks start looking more and more legitimate/trustworthy/robust. Yes, we can speculate what will happen when we come to that 1mb cap - but one thing is for sure: something WILL happen. A limit is a limit. We can't just magically exceed that limit and live in la-la land. The burden of proof is not on the person who understands what a limit is, but rather on the person who believes a limit can be ignored in respects to a growing network. I'm all ears.

I think decentralized governance can work in some respects honestly. It hasn't really been tested to any significant degree to my knowledge. I know this is a horrible comparison, but the like bar on youtube is usually a good gauge of the videos quality.

I wouldn't have it any other way.

@_date: 2016-06-15 22:33:56
I understand the basis of what Segwit is trying to accomplish, though I'm no programmer. I believe you misunderstand me as someone who is against Segwit. I'm not - I'm all for it. The problem is, as anyone familiar with tech updates/upgrades - things typically take much longer than even the developers plan for. If they're saying it'll be months/years before Segwit is fully implemented, then believe me it will take years. We DON'T have years. We don't even have months. Best case scenario is perhaps it's released tomorrow and fully implemented in 4 months time. That's 4 months too long given the scenario we're facing - rising interest in bitcoin and some estimated 10's or even 100 million additional users/investors in China. Even given the same rate of increased users (given a world where the halvening wasn't drawing mass attention to bitcoin), we would STILL need a solution to be fully implemented in 1-2 months tops. I just don't see this happening.
@_date: 2016-06-16 03:50:37
My point has nothing to do with the free market. My point is that changing the fees will not change how many transactions per second can be processed without the network shitting on itself. We're nearing the 1mb cap quickly. Increasing fees does nothing to change the capabilities of the server.
@_date: 2016-06-21 09:39:56
What? Is there something I don't get? Why the  random dislikes of my comment lol. Bitfinex IS buggy as hell and I've only been using it for a few weeks. And the downward trend was obvious, it was likely to either break up or down in a big way and it did.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:10:12
Seems to be a gamble at the moment. Increase your fee - you may be processed, you may not be. Bitcoin seems to be an exclusive club at the moment. Any implementation of Segwit will take months if not years, by then the network will have shit on itself and Bitcoin will not be viewed as a viable or reliable means of transaction.

Imagine if the bitcoin community could stop talking about ethereum all the time - haha. If you don't like it don't invest in it. There are many of us who are invested in both. And we've all heard the "ethereum is over" &amp; "bitcoin is dead" lines. There's going to be a Microsoft and Apple, competition isn't a bad thing. 
And not everyone is going to react to that negatively. I think direct democracy can be a good thing.
@_date: 2016-06-23 04:27:55
How am I gambling lol? Technically we're all gambling when we put USD into bitcoin now aren't we? But the smart thing to do is sell in a down trend and buy when it's lower. Even if you don't call the bottom perfectly. It's still better. It's just math and graphs. Ez.

Thanks, they did. I've made a killing this past week. Obviously I cut my loses like any decent trader. When I saw an uptrend, but $709 - ~ $670 was very good to me. And I understand bitcoin is likely to go to 800 if not 1000 before it completely shits itself. I'm monitoring the price all the time so I can make bank off people who aren't paying attention.
@_date: 2016-06-24 00:14:47
World GDP is expected to be 91 trillion by 2020 ( 2027 will probably look more like 100 trillion. If bitcoin holds the 80% dominance of the blockchain market, that would equate to 80% of 10 trillion or 8 trillion. I'm not sure the total amount of bitcoin by then but for the sake of math if it's around 16 million bitcoin that would put each at about $500,000 USD.
Edit: Also, GDP will probably be a bit higher than that at the current rate and USD will probably be worth shit in 2027. So maybe more like $1 million per bitcoin in 2027 USD. :P
@_date: 2016-06-21 08:11:08


I mean it's not like any of us (maybe a couple people) saw this exact scenario taking place. Ethereum isn't meant to be an experiment in direct democracy over a blockchain, but I still find it fascinating nonetheless. I actually think a judiciary system or escrow on top of the ethereum blockchain in a future release could work quite well. It wouldn't have to be forced, it might be an added feature that could be set up like escrow on sites like alibaba. For example, you could write a smart contract with or without support by a 3rd party for review in case of a dispute. That way it's open ended and no one could possibly bitch. Just a thought. I'm in no way affiliated with ethereum :P
@_date: 2016-06-21 07:15:17


The code is still law. Implementing a soft fork will introduce new code as decided upon by the community (as any fork) which will also be law. Ethereum is still in an early stage, it would be foolish to expect 0 bugs in its contracts. Obviously when the ethereum blockchain is more refined and "open for business", the coding will be less prone to bugs and there will be greater emphasis on setting clear terms and conditions. I believe the crypto community (especially the hardcore bitcoin enthusiast) has a slanted view of this. I asked several friends and coworkers (after briefly explaining smart contracts) if they would be more likely to trust a blockchain that allowed a thief who exploited a bug to get away with $millions or instead took action to secure the funds. The answer was understandably the same as I'm sure you would guess. I doubt as much as 5% of the outside world would rather see a community sit on its hand when it has the opportunity to stop such a clear and obvious abuse of the system. It's not like this will be a common occurrence... The entire mining community couldn't possibly come to consensus to fork for a misunderstanding from Sally about the terms of a smart contract for weekly payments for a car, for example. It's hard enough to derive a positive consensus even when the case is as obvious as this. The community will learn from this, and greater care will be taken to not only audit code but also set clear terms before the contract is set. There may even be a way to automatically nullify a smart-contract if a bug is abused which is not in line with the agreed upon terms or "intent" of the smart contract. For example, a smart contract for an IoT device which makes automatic micro payments for an agreed upon amount every hour, could have an additional script which monitors the payments and self-nullifies the contract if anything fishy occurs - such as a payment being made in less than or greater than the agreed upon time due to a bug in the original coding of the contract itself. Either way, I think time will show that this is an exceptional case which the entire crypto community can learn a lot from.

Ethereum doesn't need to take over bitcoin or even be money. I don't even see ethereum as money exactly. The comparison has been made that bitcoin is digital gold and ethereum is digital oil. It's just my hunch but I doubt ether will be used to purchase groceries, for example. It's more likely to be a used as a means of transferring value for smart contracts and other tasks that will take place on the "ethereum world computer".
Either way, bitcoin-only enthusiasts are shooting themselves in the foot by constantly talking down ethereum - right at the time when confused investors are looking on and trying to make sense of all this.

I don't see it going lower than it was before the craziness... It was stable at $450 for quiet a while. I think 500-550 maybe is a stable price. Then with the actual effects of the halving taking place rather than speculation on the halving, it should increase from there over the course of the year. I still think Tim Draper's $10k by 2018 is possible.
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:50:39
Why does it matter when my account was created? How old is your newest bitcoin wallet? LOL. This is an anonymous board you silly-nilly.
I've been a long time lurker, paying attention to the technology since 2013. I've told countless people bitcoin is likely to go to the moon. Just because I never used reddit before doesn't mean shit when it comes to technical analysis (which is what I excel at). Numbers don't lie. That's why I love them so much. Charts don't lie. Trends don't lie. Math doesn't lie. Everything is against the bitcoin enthusiast who is unable to look at facts and assess data. The technology IS revolutionary - which is why (given the lack of foresight from core developers) another crypto is likely to take the spot. But no, you understand numbers well enough to see that my account is 10 days old, now give me your assessment of the charts and numbers pertinent to the subject at hand and explain why you believe the bitcoin network ISN'T about to shit itself and die.
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:54:51
I first heard about bitcoin in 2013 when it was around $100. I learned more about the technology after the spike in early 2014. I knew immediately that this was the future of sending money. I've told several people over the past couple years about bitcoin - the main responses I've gotten is silk road, ponzi scheme, etc. I hadn't kept up with the news the entire time and didn't even know about the block size controversy. About 3 months ago I was curious and began looking into bitcoin again. I found out about ethereum and was excited because it allows for so much more development, creativity, and innovation. That's about it. I'm not a 2008 bitcoin jesus. Just a futurists who's interested in the tech and admittedly a little greedy in wanting to invest in the next big thing.
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:34:16
There's a lot of misunderstanding of the fork right now (not helped at all by bitcoin-only enthusiasts which are, I'm sure, enjoying every second of this). There is no proposal to reverse the transactions. A soft fork will essentially freeze ether from being withdrawn from any dao contract. A hard fork will disband thedao completely and return ether to the original dao token holders. The immutability of the blockchain will not be tarnished, but thedao experiment will end given this solution.
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:58:41


There is no "mob" lol... You watch too much TV.


No. The attacker gets to keep his stolen ether, technically. We wouldn't be reassigning anything. A fork wouldn't delete the version in which the attacker still holds the ether, as I understand it. 
Ahh loopholes. They work both ways, you see? :)


Oh come now. I'm well aware that many people see it this way. However, that was not the intent of the code or any part involved. Taking advantage of a bug in the code doesn't make it "fair and square" lol. Is taking advantage of a bug in an ATM in order withdraw $millions of other people's money just a fun little loophole?

@_date: 2016-06-15 21:56:38
LOL true. That may be a more accurate way of describing it. The real shit storm is when everyone starts selling and loses trust I suppose. Don't get me wrong - even I believe we'll probably reach $800 per bitcoin before that happens. Possibly even $1000, who knows.
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:23:32
I agree 100%. I'm ashamed by all the negativity from the bitcoin community at the moment... I think they believe that by shit-talking ethereum it will help bitcoins cause. Trillions of dollars are about to move into the blockchain sector over the next couple decades. I'm absolutely sure of that much, no matter what else happens. There's enough room for innovation in many different aspects. Blockchain technology is beginning to stretch out and there will continue to be problems as it does so. You would think the bitcoin community could understand and sympathize with this rather than constantly shit-talk 24/7.
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:41:08

I deleted my post because no one is willing to talk about things logically or critically here. I ask a question and give my thoughts and get berated by this community so what's the point?
Wouldn't it be easy to manipulate the markets if you have $10s of millions to do it? I don't see why people wouldn't do it. Have 3 somewhat wealthy individuals on 3 key exchanges such as bitfinex and okcoin. In times like this when everyone's expecting bitcoin to go up, it would be SO easy to take advantage of that, I think people here simply lack imagination... I can think of several ways myself and you haven't argued why they COULDN'T happen, so why shouldn't they?
1) Place large orders that are difficult to buy/sell past on a few of the largest exchanges to make an artificial trend line.
2) Wait for key moments when a trend line is about to break and either buy or sell in mass quantities to send the rest of the market shooting in that direction.
3) The biggest mining companies colluding together to limit supply by not selling at key times to drive the price up (this happens with the diamond market which HAS regulations, why should it not happen in the bitcoin world which has none?)
These things would be extremely easy to do and I see no reason why they wouldn't be done... The "big fish" could easily take advantage of the little fish in this market is all I'm saying, yet no one here will even entertain the thought. Why is that? Why should people be soooo against the idea that the market could be manipulated in some way?

Don't paint this as black or white. You know as well as I do that this is an unusual circumstance. It depends if we're able to learn from this and mitigate future drama or not. Again, the community isn't going to fork for some benign reason, and this is still beta. Ethereum hasn't had 8 years to establish itself yet. Personally I believe there's at least an 80% chance that ETH wil be worth $100+ one day. To me that's a good bet. I'm not an absolutist like most people here except in regards to blockchain technology in general.
Also, if I'm right and a trillion+ $ moves into blockchain technology over the next couple decades (from literally dozens of industries), then even Ripple may one day be worth 10x what it now, if not far more - just for being one of the top cryptos with name recognition and an established blockchain.
Think outside the box. There's room for damn-near every crypto to grow exponentially. I want to pick the next Microsoft AND Apple.

Any new technology will have trouble being adopted... Don't talk to me like I'm 5, I'm actually pretty intelligent. Here's the thing: There are going to be problems, both foreseen and unforeseen. In my opinion, we should work to fix the foreseen problems before they blow up in our face. This COULD have been solved well over a year ago by simply increasing the capacity to 2mb temporarily until Segwit or similar solution is implemented. Now we're in a situation which discredits the entire crypto movement simply because several at the "top" refused to listen in time.
@_date: 2016-06-16 04:30:05
There are literally no problems. 
Lol um... We're currently at around 90-95% of the 1mb blocksize cap. How is that not a problem given the fact that a solution is months away and the rate of adoption has only increased?
"And no, I didn't miss your point."
I think you did though - because the only point I made you glossed over and called obvious. That was my only point - that increasing the transaction fee does nothing to increase the block size cap or help with scaling in any way. I was discounting the notion that charging a higher fee for a boat which is already filled will allow you to fit more people. 
"They got uninformed people like you to concern troll."
I think you're uninformed if you haven't looked at the charts and considered what will happen when the average block size is also 1 mb. Is Mike Hearn a "concern troll" ( Or is he maybe someone who knows a lot more about the situation than yourself?
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:46:05
"If you choose this path, then you go against this:"
The system itself doesn't care... It's just code.
The community will ALWAYS have consensus the same way the bitcoin mining community does. Let's dissect this logically. The community is having a hard enough time with a fork in an obvious case where money was stolen. To suggest that any legitimate contract could inspire a soft or hard fork is ridiculous. Also, direct democracy isn't seen as a bad thing by everyone. Ethereum isn't trying to be bitcoin 2.0. It's trying to be something far more useful and interesting IMO.
"Haha, be prepare to get sued and held liable for everything that happens in your little world. You guys don't understand the fundamental reason for a blockchain if you're taking this path. If something bad happens again, you will be expected to fix it, or be held liable for it."
Who will be held liable? The miners? This is direct democracy. There's no one to sue lol... I don't think you fully understand the situation, with all due respect.
"The price of Eth is going to drop to zero once the lawsuits start rolling in."
Ok lol. Go ahead and short ether. You could make a lot of money if you're right. :)
In the end, time will tell.
@_date: 2016-06-21 08:22:25


Well let's think about this rationally for a second. I agree that nothing would be done for anyone who loses a couple thousand to a badly coded contract. But that's primarily because a couple thousand $ isn't enough to concern the entire community. The ethereum blockchain is acting for it's own self interest at the moment, no doubt about that. But I see nothing wrong with this. You're painting it as just the developers that lost money and just the developers that are making a choice, but that's not true at all.


a) Nothing is being rolled back
b) It's not the "elite" that are making the decision 


People will use smart contracts because there are huge advantages in doing so. The technology will also become more secure.
Who will trust bitcoin as a method of payment after the bubble of 2013 and the fluctuation in price?

I don't even see it as an alternative at all. I'm invested in both. Ethereum is trying to do something completely different than bitcoin at the moment. Blockchain technology will be a trillion dollar industry because eventually everyone will see the advantages and it has such wide applications. Everything from medical, housing, banking, leasing, contracts, apps, etc. Bitcoin can't hog it all no matter how hard it tries. People will learn eventually when they see multiple billion dollar block chains - not just bitcoin and ethereum...

@_date: 2016-06-22 23:02:26
I would love to see a steady increase instead of all this volatility. If most of bitcoin's price swings continue to be driven mostly by speculators using leverage, it seems unlikely that the general public will want to pick it up as a currency. No one wants to wake up to their bank account being worth 10-15% less than it was the day before. I'm hoping after all this craziness it'll settle down and climb slowly due to the actual effects of the halving rather than just the speculation of the halving and other events.

The code doesn't exist independent of the creators or the community...


No transactions will be rolled back. That's a common (and possibly deliberate?) misunderstanding. 


a) Yes there is, the main thing that makes smart contracts sexy is their ability to self execute, not their ability to fly under a legal radar when such an obvious case of abuse is apparent to all.
b) As I described above, a fork will ONLY happen in clear and obvious cases such as this (in fact I highly doubt a case like this will occur again, given the shit storm it's become). Of course you can write some code and try to get miners to support a fork if you got scammed for not reading the fine print for your IoT smart contract. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:38:01
No one seems to understand - fees are irrelevant if the network can't even handle 3 transactions per second without shitting all over itself...
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:45:35
Wrong. It'll be considered more legitimate if the funds are locked. Those looking from the outside world will see it as a correction of a disaster which Bitcoin is unable to do where legal matters are concerned. It will actually be a very good thing in the long run, you'll see. But if you're so sure, please short ethereum and test your theory out :)

And if people continue to not care it's going to keep happening...
Good strategy!
Also keep in mind that the legitimacy of the exchanges does in fact have an effect on the price of bitcoin... So perhaps everyone here should care to SOME degree...
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:28:45
Centralization seems to be a huge flaw (currently at least) in the security of bitcoin. The fact that trading volume AND hashing power are both extremely focused in China could lead to a huge crash at this point. Bitcoin has flown under the radar to some degree but now with more and more Chinese using bitcoin as a means of securing their wealth outside of the CNY and banks, I would no longer consider this a possibility outside the realms of discussion.

You're delusional at best... We are at the very limits of the bitcoin networks capabilities TODAY - not 6 months from now (and even 6 months is highly optimistic as it will likely take over a year to fully implement). Again, we need a solution YESTERDAY. Not today, not tomorrow, not 6 months from now. Those who claim that higher fees will solve the problem essentially have the IQ of a retarded squirrel - think about it, if EVERYONE sets their transfer fees higher then the problem remains, the only difference is now it's more expensive for everyone. It's like saying "just climb higher" while on the Titanic as it's sinking and EVERYONE is trying to climb higher. Yeah... that's kinda what everyone wants to do, but the ship can no longer support them and every passing moment the surface area decreases...

Just so you understand my position further - I HATE what is happening right now... I very much want bitcoin to succeed. I have some money in other coins - yes, but bitcoin failing won't mean ethereum or any other altcoin skyrockets - it will literally set the technology and the entire community back at least a year or 2 before another crypto can fill the void. If Bitcoin went to $200, nearly all other alt coins will suffer in the short term and it will take many many months for them to recover. I HATE what's happening right now and the fact that Bitcoin simply isn't allowed to scale past this point - it simply can't scale past this point currently, at least not more than 5-10% tops (which is nothing at the rate bitcoin is growing). The part the frustrates myself and others so much isn't that we want bitcoin to fail, it's that we want bitcoin to succeed and we understand that this was a foreseeable problem - one talked about YEARS ago. If I was new to the scene and just learned of bitcoin 10 days ago (LOL) I wouldn't be sooo fucking frustrated right now... It's precisely because I care that I am.

"Now ETH is bailing out its too big to fail DAO."
If someone drains money from an ATM due to a hack or bug in the system, should the users of that bank lose their money? And how is the ability to seize the funds stolen by the ATM hacker and possibly even returning those funds a "bailout"?
Bitcoin-only enthusiasts just want Ethereum to do nothing because then it actually might be in trouble. A resolution of this situation will legitimize Ethereum even further.
Also, the hard fork being suggested is NOT "TheDao is too big to fail"... It's the precise opposite and you don't know what you're talking about. The hard fork will COMPLETELY DISBAND THEDAO. It would be like if we said "fuck you jpmorgan &amp; chase, we're going to return the money to the people and destroy you completely".

The foundation isn't enforcing anything. The miners are acting on their own. There's nothing stopping anyone from *attempting* to sue the majority of miners, I suppose - but the same could happen with bitcoin technically. Good luck with that LOL. You're overreacting. The community isn't going to fork for stupid disputes  - they're having a hard enough time now when the decision should be obvious.

Satoshi Nakamoto intended the block size limit to be increased. There's no reason we can't increase to 2mb before the shit hits the fan. I have little hope for bitcoin if this keeps up. Dash is already a better payment system in many regards, and will shadow bitcoin completely if we're still talking 2-3 transactions per second a year or 2 from now... Bitcoin is slow and sluggish now compared to just about every other blockchain available. No one is going to want to use a 56k modem when broadband is accessible. The fact that we're even debating this as other cryptos handily pass us by is in-fucking-sane.

I really have no intention other to voice my frustration at a problem that would have been easily fixable months ago. Yes, the unconfirmed transactions will go down - the transactions per second is only 1.5 right now as opposed to 3.2 earlier... Do you know what a trend is?

I can't confirm whether those having trouble with transactions at the moment are trolls, using outdated wallets, or have negative motives. All I can say without a shadow of a doubt is that we're nearing the limits of the blockchains current capabilities. I'm sure you're right that there is a deliberate effort to fuck with the blockchain. So what? It will become even easier to do so as we near the block size limit and as more (legitimate) users increase the tps day by day. The notion that in 1 month it'll be even easier to flood the system and we may see 150,000 unconfirmed transactions does absolutely 0 to negate my concerns...

It's based on what the community wants to do.


No. It's precisely the opposite. If the average voter had a say in the bank bailouts, do you honestly think they would have gotten it? What's wrong with trusting the community of a blockchain which uses said blockchain to make certain decisions regarding which version of the protocol they choose to run?


That wasn't my point at all. My point is that people will use ethereum because it has a sexy use-case. And ethereum isn't trying to be bitcoin. Ethereum isn't trying to appeal to the libertarian or the silk road market. And that's OK. The blockchain sector is about to become massive... Don't hate just because there's a system that's different in many respects than bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:34:18
I'm going to copy paste someone else's post because I'm feeling a bit lazy at the moment and they summed it up nicely:
"An important question that needs to be answered is who and what is Ethereum for? Is it just for crypto-anarchists or the general public?
If you think the point of Ethereum is a kind of bitcoin 2.0 i.e for crypto-anarchists to be able to make financial transactions free of any interferance. That the point is to be free not just from goverment interfeerance but from any kind of social or ethical restraint. That the value of the network is being able to buy drugs, buy child porn, fund terrorism, steal assets, create autonomous ransomware or bounties for hacking. If you believe that the kind of society you want is one where code is law no matter how buggy or how bad the consequences then vote against the hard fork. Crypto-anarchists will not forgive us for bringing ethics into the system.
If you think the point of Ethereum is to enable the world to access innovative services based on distributed consensus like: computing, micropayments based APIs, unforgeable supply chain records, community electricity grids, an internet of rentable things, finance, insurance, markets, betting, synthetic borderless share trading then vote for the hard fork. The general public will not trust us unless we bring ethics into the system."
Put simply, ethereum isn't for you. But NO ONE in the business world will see it the same as you. I can't prove this to you, it just seems obvious to me. Only time will prove this. Investors won't say "Oh, a hackers plot was foiled and the money returned to the investors in a professional manner. I was totally interested in blockchain technology but now I'm turned off". That's ludicrous. Most investors aren't anarchists. Ethereum puts a public face on blockchain technology and allows for wide adoption and innovation. 
Again, only time will tell but I'm convinced that I'm right. If we handle this situation accordingly, ethereum will once again continue it's course to the moon.

I knew it was coming and was just waiting for the final peak to sell so I could buy and get more btc when everyone freaked out. Instead I'm now fucked because "infrastructure issue". What a joke.

I'm sure it's not as simple as replacing a line of code - that's why I said implementing a solution will take months if not years. I feel they should have began working on this when the issue was first being raised rather than wait to see if it blows up in our faces. We are, after all, talking about thousands of peoples investments here - and oh so much more than that. I'm not a bitcoin hater. I want it to succeed very much. Unfortunately now I believe the likelihood of ethereum or another blockchain taking over is very high. And from everything I've read, a 2mb as apposed to 1mb size cap couldn't possibly derail the system or have any legitimately negative effects as could doing nothing (or waiting 2 years and then doing something).
Is the DDOS scenario I laid out a realistic one or is there something I'm missing? If someone could do it back in feb and average block size has only increased since then, wouldn't it be even easier to do now? And if a small handful of people decided they wanted to make money (as often happens), could they not short the market and cause a premature panic by overloading the system for a couple days this time (likely around July 10th when people are getting ready to sell anyway). This WOULD cause the price of bitcoin to plummet as many would lose faith. They could easily short the market, buy back in when it's low, wait for it to rise, then lather rinse repeat.
Is there something stopping people from doing this?

How is the blocksize not a problem? It's already been a problem in peak transaction times creating backlogged transaction and unpredictable confirmations. I am rather new to the community, but can you explain how this isn't a problem? If we're having trouble accepting 2-3 transactions a second today, and implementing any solution will take months if not years - how can you look at that and think it's stable? Consider this: at any moment someone is going to realize that they can DOS the blockchain as happened on feb 28th, but this time to short the market. Get 5 nerds in their basement all short the market then buy when everyone freaks out and sells... So easy. Explain how this couldn't happen.

My guess is that most would compare that to losing your wallet just as most would compare thedao situation with someone hacking an ATM or robbing a bank. I can ask and see what my own circle thinks though.
Either way, the comparison isn't equivalent as there's no thief involved. A more fair comparison would be MtGox (which many have made). In the case of MtGox, personally I wouldn't have been against the bitcoin community taking action (if there was a way?) rather than the legal shit storm, negative attention, and loss of hundreds of $millions the entire community had to endure. I'm sure that sounds like heresy to most on And perhaps it wouldn't have been good for Bitcoin. But regardless, try to understand that ethereum isn't bitcoin, nor is it trying to be.

It might make more sense than ETH/USD.
Still a very foolish and risky bet IMO. What if the hard fork succeeds and investors rally the price back up to $16? If bitcoin also hits, say $900-1000 you may still make a small amount shorting... But why? There's better investments. In this scenario, just going long on bitcoin is a much better investment. Also shorting is a horrible way to make money... An emerging market has a lot more room to move upward than down. You *might* double your money shorting something if you're lucky. But there's opportunities to literally make 10x-100x your money cropping up all the time in this space. By 2020, how many cryptos do you think will have over $1 billion market cap? If you believe the answer will still be 2, then you're short sighted. If you believe there will be a dozen or so, then there's a dozen opportunities to make 100-1000x times your money on those investments. Anyone looking to short ether is missing the big picture...

It's just my guess that there will be a little more panic selling because bitcoin has already shot up $hundreds just on hype. It might take months for the price to naturally increase back to $700ish based on reduced daily supply. Or it could go to $800 tomorrow. No one really knows. I *personally* believe bitcoin is likely to reach $1k at some point this year. But either way, don't invest more than you're willing to lose and don't put too much stock in what random people on the internet say. Especially on this reddit. There are plenty of people here that hype news like the halving far too much.

Haha nice. I'm glad to be part of a community that can fix a bug in a reasonable amount of time rather than sit around for 3 years and debate and then be forced (very soon) to make that decision.

Ethereum will have (at least) $50 billion market cap at some point within the next 4 years.
Please short it. I can get in at a lower price and whenever the short squeeze happens it will slingshot ethereum to new highs and bring more attention to the platform.
We don't want dumb money in the ethereum project.
We want dumb money to short ether at $12 like a bunch of morons  so the smart people can get in at $10 and make a bigger fortune.

Far more people use scottrade. There's backup servers and ways to mitigate these sorts of things...
I don't buy it. Also, it seems to me poloniex is the exchange experiencing heavy traffic today, as far more ETC is being traded than any other coin. Bitfinex mysteriously went down last time after thedao incident - and their excuse made little sense. I highly highly highly doubt this is a coincidence...
Edit: And even if it IS a coincidence, that shouldn't stop people from leaving bitfinex in droves... This isn't the first and it won't be the last. The way they handle these problems is very unprofessional.
Edit2: 
"Web Server  Operational,
Trading Engine Operational,
Backend Workers Operational"
So what then? Their code just up and changed? Their server and trading engine is up...

The big fish need to get out BEFORE the dumpening, not after. Personally i think it's going to $550.

The intent was clearly not to have 60 million stolen... Don't give me that crap. Such thinking has no basis in reality.

You have precisely 0 understanding of the situation...
Please do some research on the subject rather than displaying such a painful level of ignorance for all to see.

Their excuse last time was that they were changing servers. They knew beforehand they were changing servers and yet refused to announce it so people were unable to pull their margin trades.

You entirely missed my point. If it's possible for one exchange (certified, registered or not makes 0 fucking difference) to maintain servers and backup servers, then it's possible for a bitcoin exchange.
What you're essentially saying is that bitcoin exchanges should not be required to adequately maintain their servers so their users don't lose hundreds/thousands of dollars?
Yeah fuck that.
My ENTIRE POINT is that we SHOULD *REQUIRE* that bitcoin exchanges act more professionally, as many people DO have thousands of dollars on the line. If legal action can not be taken then action should be taken with our dollars. I'm sure others feel the same and they stand to lose users every time this happens - but there's nothing wrong with me promoting this idea to others as well.

They are updating based upon consensus of the community to choose to not accept a bad contract. A contracts purpose is to uphold the intent of 2 parties and be validated by a 3rd party or parties. The outcome of this contract was clearly not followed as intended. So why should we accept it? Ethereum isn't the same as bitcoin. You must consider what a contract is, and what it's useful for.
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:54:59
How so?
@_date: 2016-07-06 02:31:58


I was being sarcastic actually. I'm mimicking some of the rhetoric I've heard around here about smart contracts being too complicated to code properly.

* No crypto is a "reliable" store of value. Not sure where you got this notion
* There's no evidence that bitcoin will retain market dominance. Stating so as fact only shows your own bias and lack of critical thinking.
* The most important utility of crypto is not likely to be as a "sponge". Microtransactions, decentralized cloud storage, and social networks using a social "attention" currency are all use cases which are far easier to convince the general public to adopt rather than switching the currency they use.
But, even though I'm right and you're wrong, you get upvoted and I'll get downvoted because @_date: 2016-07-21 23:33:08
I stopped reading at "rolled back".
Whoever wrote this clearly has little understanding of the situation.

What about the news which mods censor?

There are no "bear whales" IMO. It's just everyone preemptively getting out and taking their profits before others do. And making money off everyone who got in late, essentially.

You have chosen your god (eth) and now you are praying.
You do have to spell it out, as your knowledge of me and my investments is lacking, thus allowing you to easily assume and come to incorrect conclusions. I don't "pray", that requires faith. I KNOW blockchain technology will be a trillion dollar industry in the coming decade or 2. I'm not solely invested in ethereum either, nor do I necessarily believe it will give the greatest return. For example, I think Factom and Storj could easily achieve 100x their current value. Storj is essentially a better version of dropbox, which has a $10 billion dollar market cap. If storj achieved half that success (and cloud storage will become even more relevant in the coming years, making even that $10 billion amount seem exceptionally low), it would return 1000x any current investment. So no, ethereum isn't the only "god" I "pray" to. I'm also invested in bitcoin. Bitcoin has a lot of promise. If we can move past this 1mb cap and get on with segwit and lightning network, I have little doubt that bitcoin can remain the dominant player in blockchain technology.
What I was saying isn't "ethereum will be the only successful blockchain". FAR from it. What I'm saying is this: shorting ANY legitimate blockchain, literally 1-2 years before the sector will begin EXPLODING, is fucking stupid beyond belief. I wouldn't short any blockchain at the moment. Not even dogecoin... The amount of money that will soon be pouring into this sector is unimaginable. Why would you short one of the most legitimate and interesting blockchain in existence at a time like this?...

There's 2 problems with your understanding of the situation, with all due respect.
1) No developer is making the choice, nor is there a single point of authority. That's why it's a DAO.
2) No one is rolling back or controlling investments. TheDao will be dismantled and investments will be returned. This is a community consensus.
There is no illegal activity. One digital commodity was traded for another digital commodity. This happens every day. As long as everyone involved is reporting capital gains (or lose) in their taxes, there is nothing illegal going on.

And Vericoin! ICO on july 20th for a digital reserve "verium" which will add security and faster block times. Only way to buy verium will be using vericoin, so the price should naturally spike here in the coming days.

Smart contracts are too buggy and complicated. Rootstock will be thedao 2.0! FUD!
