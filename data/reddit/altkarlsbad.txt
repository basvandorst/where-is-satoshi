That was backwards, sorry about that.

I don't know where you are going with that story, but you stop it right now. It made my eyes misty with only 37 words.

Wait, this looks like a fun-oriented post. Is leaking?
Does leak or urine-mark?

I read about half, but it seems so fanciful, so divorced from reality, I just couldn't keep slogging through it. 
Back to my too-flippant reply, though, this whole idea seems to boil down to 'might makes right'. Whoever can enforce their version of the law wins, justice be damned.
I'm not a fan of that idea.

Oh, shoot, I'm sorry to learn that. Those poor Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Danish folks are all going to perish once they learn that social democracy is fatal!
I'm downvoting this whole thread, it's less about bitcoin and more about liberterian fantasies. Actually, you advocated anarchy, so I've totally lost interest in your opinions at this point.

Love your username combined with this post.
There have been tons of bank failures post-Fed. We've got loads of banks going tits-up during this last bubble, plus the S&amp;L crisis from the 90's, banks failed in the oil bust/boom cycle of the 80's, banks failed during the oil shocks of the 70's, etc. etc.
And your own information calls into question the effectiveness of the Fed. If it was supposed to stabilize the economy but at the cost of unrelenting inflation, it should make a bigger difference than 24 vs. 18!

Land owners don't prosecute. They can sue, assuming they have the cash to lubricate the wheels of justice. However, that generally requires a lot of money to pursue privately. How would a poor land owner or river owner pursue justice with an upstream polluter if they can't afford legal fees?
How do we handle the problem of disappearing polluters? You know, the kind that pollute an area, sell of their holdings and dissolve the corporation? This happens quite often and in practice, makes it impossible to hold anyone responsible.

This obviously makes sense, but in laissez-faire capitalism, there are no penalties. That's kind of what the phrase means, really.
"abstention by governments from interfering in the workings of the free market."

I totally screwed that up. My bad.
Under fractional reserve banking as practiced today, a bank can take in a $10 deposit and make $9 in loans (they must 'reserve' 10% of their deposits[1] ).  Those loans are deposited in other banks by the borrowers.
Those banks may then loan out 90% of that money, $8.10, into circulation and leaving $0.90 in reserve. Total deposits at this point across all banks is $19, total reserves is $1.1, total loans are $17.10. 
This can continue for several layers, resulting in total loans that are well in excess of the 'real' money that exists. Assume that initial deposit had serial numbers on the dollars. Where are those serial numbers after 1 round of reloaning? How many serial numbers would you need to describe all these dollars? 40?
That's how people say commercial banks 'make up new money', they really do generate dollars that didn't exist before they made a loan.

just use RES and ignore the user?

Oh, cool, so I could institute a private law that anyone polluting my portion of the river has to pay me 5 billion dollars per infringement?

total money supply increases with each new loan.
Lending out deposited money (with no fractional reserve) does NOT increase the total money supply.

Unregulated laissez-faire capitalism has a history of crapping in its own nest, i.e. rivers that burn and dead lakes.
How do we prevent those obviously negative and undesirable outcomes in laissez-faire capitalism?
How also do we separate state and economics? What would those policies look like?
(In advance, I ask that you not try to tell me that government regulation leads to pollution, that one is worn out.)

obviously (I thought), the opposite of 'fractional' reserve banking is 'full' reserve banking.
A bank takes in $10 in deposits to a checking account. The bank may make $0 in loans.
A bank takes in $10 in CD's or other time-constrained deposits. The bank may loan some portion of that CD money, but the loan is due before the CD.
No new money is created by lending.
(and actually,  you asked what the difference was between fractional reserve banking and full reserve banking in your original post, just not in those terms)

No, if they are denominated in another currency (dollars), then it would be a real stretch to call it a  currency unto itself.

I'm not following your reply, so let me try again.
Under fractional reserve banking as practiced today, a bank can take in a $10 deposit and make $9 in loans (they must 'reserve' 10% of their [deposits]( When they make those $9 in loans, they have created $9 new dollars that didn't exist before.  Total money supply increased. 
Without fractional reserve banking, a bank could lend up to $1 out from a $1 deposit.
Does that make sense?

BTC can be **exchanged** for fiat, at rates that vary depending on market conditions.
Gift certificates flat out state their value strictly in terms of fiat.
*Exchanged for* and *Denominated in* are 2 very different concepts to me.

But for purposes of this conversation, the question is: "Would Android have been created without the existences of gnu/linux?". I'm pretty sure the answer is no.

I think it's making fun of Bitcoin supporters, more than Bitcoin.  
Some of the things people say when advocating for the death of fiat currency are pretty much straight out of the comic, no?
