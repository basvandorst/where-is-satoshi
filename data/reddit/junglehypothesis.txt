I think I agree with you, other than your claim that Bitcoin as a value-transfer system is preposterous - that is far from reality. It works very well for a nascent technology undergoing rapid development (have you seen the mempool lately?) and is about to work faster and cheaper than any other payment system in history (tried Lightning test or main net?). 
I’m also sure many HODLers wish they sold or bought stuff mid-month. In truth Bitcoin is ascending to its fair value, it won’t increase on a USD basis forever but has a long ways to go yet...

Cracks me up how touchy anti-bitcoiners get on here! I never suggested Alts don’t serve a useful purpose nor that Blockchain isn’t useful for non-financial use cases. 
This is about blockchain as a value transfer mechanism that governments and corporates wish to retain control over and capitalize on this innovation in a centralised manner for maximum manipulation and hence profit. In other words same old same old.
They’re of course free to embrace whatever they like, but trying to distance Blockchain from Bitcoin in public demonstrates either devious intent or ignorance.  They are one and the same from an historical, functional and user base (by far at present) standpoint.
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:08:36
Bitcoin birthed Blockchain and at inception was an exchange of assets in its simplest form. They are forever linked and to state you like one but not the other is preposterous. Of course Blockchain has other purposes, that’s not the point.

The inherent value of a Blockchain is in its distributed consensus and user base. Bitcoin is by far the most distributed value-transfer Blockchain with the most users and real transactions. To hence promote the virtues of Blockchain for value-transfer purposes but dismiss Bitcoin as irrelevant (as per Starbucks CEO) is preposterous. I agree with Wences on this. If you don’t, that’s cool.

We’ll see more of this “I like Blockchain, so please give my share price a hot Blockchain price injection... but I don’t like Bitcoin” BS in future. 
After seeing Long Island Ice Tea briefly rebrand as the Long Blockchain Company and have its share prices jump, Mr Schmultz simply wants some of that same sweet Wall St hype. 
But he doesn’t want to give legitimacy to Bitcoin, he’s likely in bed with all kinds of old world financial dinosaurs who are petrified by the concept of Bitcoin relinquishing their control over capital. What he doesn’t understand is he has no choice. Starbucks will be accepting Lightning Bitcoin payments by 2020.

Bitcoin is closer to ARPANET or email if you want to talk old school web analogies, it’s an enabling fabric that is now irreplaceable. Netscape wasn’t even the first web browser - WorldWideWeb, MidasWWW, Cello and Mosaic all came before it. In fact Mosaic was effectively forked into Netscape. So if you want to use web browsers as a brainless analogy, you’d be more accurate to state Litecoin or Bcash are to the Blockchain as Netscape was to the Internet.

We now have governments, banks and corporations extolling the virtues of Blockchain for value-transfer, but dismissing Bitcoin. Look to the nonsense spouted by Starbuck’s CEO today.

No absolutes, but it is a quick and easy measure to test that someone holds an insight on reality that transcends the majority. This is difficult to do with all the hot air and vested interests swirling around crypto. 
Simple fact is Bitcoin started Blockchain. It is the TCP/IP of decentralized value transfer. Of course there are other uses for Blockchain and you can talk up alts just as you can CLNS, TP4, AppleTalk, Xerox XNS, PUP, Novell IPX/SPX, etc. But it won’t change the outcome.

There has always been a transaction rate problem, it’s all relative, Visa also has a transaction rate problem should the unbanked of this planet get a credit card. You cannot expect a perfect, globally scalable payment platform to magically materialise for your own benefit out of what was started as a small experiment. You also cannot change a “1” to an “8” to make bitcoin scale to the likes of Visa today. There are no short cuts. Some patience and dare I say it, cooperation is required as this world changing technology matures for global adoption. Equating hard working Bitcoin developers (that have made you rich) to the Taliban is low and by definition smear.

Bic Camera in Japan is a large electronics retailer  that accepts 0-conf Bitcoin transactions up to ~$3000  and has done so for some time. Never had any issue with them, in fact they raised the limit from $1000 to $3000 after other electronics stores followed suit.

Side effect is individually some Japanese can simply survive without ever questioning anything or really thinking much. You just coast along in the sea of cooperation and rely on everyone else. This isn’t all Japanese, many are the complete opposite.
I also despise this BitFlyer nonsense. Yamada Denki also mandates use of the BitFlyer app, apparently because they accept 0-conf and want assurances they’ll get their money after you walk out the door. Some Japanese can be very risk averse. But again not all so there are options, I take my Bitcoin to Bic Camera instead where you can pay anyway you like.

As Bitcoin’s price appreciates a point could be reached at which an attack by a bad actor, whether it be China, the NSA or other to either steal Bitcoin or entirely destroy the network becomes viable.

My point is you have no idea what is now going on within the NSA and military industrial complex with its countless billions in funding.

Bitcoin doesn’t associate and publish your personal data including name, address, etc with every single transaction. LN will also remove the need for nodes to store every single transaction.

It's good practice to generate new addresses each time you transact, but with Quantum Computing the problem becomes how do you actually spend? 
This is because when you create a new transaction, it includes your public key. Even if it's an address you've never used before, in that instant you've just disclosed enough information for a quantum computer to immediately impersonate you.
@_date: 2018-05-26 03:03:32

Cool, A reminder will be interesting. 
For the record, I'm not claiming in 5 years we'll have a quantum computer that can crack ECDSA - it is IBM who are now warning this is a possibility and suggesting customers think about their data. Of any company that should know, it is them. But of course they want more projects and sweet software licensing deals.
I'm sure you're aware IBM publicly announced last year they have an operational [50 Qubit Quantum Computer] ( and have a 20 Qubit system available for customers to rent - in other words 'productized'. Behind the scenes they likely have more and we do not need a productized quantum computer for Bitcoin to get rekt - a fleeting PoC in a lab that produces just one of Satoshi's or a large exchange's private keys would be enough. Confidence would be ruined and the project over.
I think it foolish to bet everything on the assumption IBM is wrong. I hope they are, but we could do more to be prepared, it should be zero risk, regardless of whether it's 5, 10 or 50 years out. But it is coming.

I also presumed at least 10 years out, but for IBM to start publicly warning the population to “move your data now” in anticipation of a 5 year timeframe and the attack being instantaneous, they may suspect or know something we don’t. 
And why would we dare risk assuming it’s longer than a 5 year horizon? Without a fix Quantum Computing would render Bitcoin completely worthless overnight.

Yes, you're correct, but it's still not the best analogy. For 50 years we've had a distinct technological roadblock for sustainable and productive fusion reaction, whilst quantum computing is progressing at an increasingly alarming rate. 
For example in 2016 China launched Micius - a quantum satellite they since used for a quantum-secured video call between Beijing and Vienna, in 2017 China and Google entangled 10 superconducting qubits and then IBM announced they have a 50 Qubit quantum computer. How long until we have multi-thousand Qubit quantum computers? I think IBM is hinting at 5 years.

"As a software engineer of 20 years, with a mechanical engineering degree, I also call bullshit."
Your articulate comment which attempts to position yourself with a level of superiority could be construed as either outright disagreeing with IBM, or indicating they are intentionally misguiding the public. You were not clear, so it is impossible to tell.
Wherever did I state I've "got it all figured out"? I am precisely making the point that WE HAVE NO IDEA what is being or has already been developed.
Whilst I would never put it past IBM or any other large corporate to intentionally misguide, their warnings appear to be increasing in intensity to the point of becoming recommendations that their clients move data now. Of course this could be a mechanism to boost sales.
You can believe whatever you want. But I for one do not believe universities, publicly listed companies and armchair warriors are at the forefront of Quantum Computing research. I do suspect IBM is aware of something more than they are letting on.

Thanks  for sharing, good to know that options are being considered. 
Bitcoin is far too important IMHO to let the noise created by a few selfish centralized bad actors detract attention from our greater cause. We have enough struggle combating noise from banks, governments and corporations.
Rather than risk further allegations of censorship, can we autoflag any post with “Ver”, “Bcash”,  “Bcore”, “bitcoin,com” etc and variants as an off-topic shitpost?
I also think banning has gotten over the top, it’s causing people to hold a grudge and default to the other sub. A warning should do, along with flagging of any subversive posts.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:12:34
To me he came out of nowhere too after many years in crypto, but I understand now that he pushes his own agenda stronger than most of the stereotypical meek IT types. Ver is into martial arts and is an aggressive personality. No doubt he coined the Jesus moniker for himself too and sells that branding rather effectively.  
But he has virtually no IT skills I’m aware of and there are larger holders of Bitcoin than Ver as well, but they aren’t attention seekers lusting for power and notoriety. 
His claim to fame seems only to be the “very first investor in Bitcoin startups”, which is entirely meaningless and technically that label belongs to Satoshi or perhaps whomever paid for the Bitcoin.org domain.

So did many other people. Bitcoin would be in a much better position today if Ver and his cohort weren’t attacking it for their own enrichment and ego stroking. Fact is this Ver character only first heard about Bitcoin on the FreeTalkLive podcast in 2011, he was late to the party but took a big bet. Hardly influential and his technical knowledge is below average. He is perhaps the most untrustworthy and disliked character in the entire space (for a reason).

It is almost inconceivably corrupt, but the strongest indication is much it has been melted down in Europe from 400oz bars to 1kg bars and then sold off to the East. The huge influx of gold into China in recent years cannot be explained by mining alone, it appears central banks decided to put their idle asset to use and “lend” it out via the bullion banks to generate return, with it replaced by a bunch of paper IOUs. Problem is there isn’t that much gold in existence (all gold mined in human history would fit into an Olympic swimming pool), so they will never be able to replenish what’s been technically loaned out, but in reality irreversibly lost. Look up Jim Rickards if you want to learn more about this.

You could add as near likely events:
6. Mtgox bankruptcy process concludes, all verified claimants receive either 100% of cash amount lost in 2014, or percentage of BTC holdings. Uncertainty over Mtgox evaporates.
7. CSW is exposed in court as a fraud, confirming the original Satoshi stash of up to 1m BTC is to remain effectively lost. CSW also receives prison sentence for perjury.
8. In addition to JP Morgan Coin and Libra, the rumored Goldman Sachs Coin further validates Bitcoin in institutional markets. Many corporate “wannabe” coins end up as onramps to Bitcoin.
9. More decentralized exchanges launch, meaning less risk and exit scams. Retail trading apps also launch which store keys locally for improved security (e.g. Tzero).
10. A Central Bank (Russia?) is confirmed to be stock piling Bitcoin and partially responsible for mid-2019 recovery.
11. Bitcoin’s continued retracement to 2017 highs sees most altcoins left behind with low valuations, including all Bitcoin forks.
12. Increased hostility and potential war with Iran sees Bitcoin achieve true safe haven asset status, solidifying its status as Gold 2.0.

There are many triggers without a gold standard that can lead to hyper inflation, for example war, which can now be physical or even more likely a trade/currency war with China or Russia. As you say double digit inflation is a distinct possibility regardless, maybe not 50% per month which some define as hyper-inflation, but I’d say anything double digit is rather “hyper”.

If Brock always owned Mt Gox, does this mean he finally gets to go to prison?
“Pierce retired from acting at 17 and joined as a minor partner with Marc Collins-Rector and Chad Schackley in establishing Digital Entertainment Network (DEN). He produced its first show, a pilot for gay teenagers called Chad’s World. Pierce began enjoying a lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles riding the Dot-com bubble. 
As an 18 year old, Pierce was making $250,000 a year and held 1% of the company’s shares. Within three years, DEN, never having made a profit and having exhausted its venture capital, collapsed and Pierce fled the U.S. with his two co-founders when a number of former underage DEN employees made sexual misconduct allegations against them.
The three were arrested by Spanish police before being returned to the US. Though Pierce was not ultimately charged, his partner Collins-Rector was convicted on multiple counts of child enticement involving boys.
Running DEN out of a Los Angeles mansion, Collins-Rector and his business partners — Chad Shackley (who was also Rector’s romantic partner) and Brock Pierce — hosted lavish parties, attended by Hollywood’s gay A-list. It was at those parties where Collins-Rector, and others allegedly sexually assaulted teenage boys.”

If in 2013, when Bitcoin was under $100, you asked people if $20k was likely anytime 'soon', most would say definitely not. But in 4 short years it happened. That's over 200x in just 4 years. 
$250k is only 12.5x the high we saw in late 2017.  In my opinion achieving $250k at 25x current prices is much more feasible than the 200x we already did to hit $20k.
Consider also that Bitcoin now garners significantly more attention, more wallets are being created daily, more companies are entering the space with more investment in infrastructure. Every additional day Bitcoin exists, it cements its position as a true contender as a digital replacement for gold, the defacto money of the internet and potential replacement global reserve currency. The likelihood of Bitcoin's success only increases day after day.
Bitcoin appears binary in terms of price outcome - either it goes to zero, or something astronomical. Humans naturally have a difficulty comprehending exponential functions, but Bitcoin's adoption is following just that.  Worth a bet IMO, but not more than you can afford to lose. If it all crashes down, then it's been fun watching the memes.

Hey you may be absolutely right, I’m still researching what’s needed. As per most things in Japan there’s so much confusing and conflicting information out there. Apparently in Tokyo all things drone related came under tight scrutiny after a drone was found on the Japanese Prime Minister’s roof plus Yakuza were using them to deliver drugs. So you can’t fly in Tokyo anymore without a permit each and every time. There also appears to be a “Drone Pilot Certificate” across all of Japan which is what I believe some call a license, but it seems this is an opt-in non-compulsory kind of thing.

No problems, you can buy a Spark and won’t need any permit unless you want to fly in Tokyo. The Spark is awesome, one of the best designed and featured drones around. I only went with the Mavic given I’m into video and wanted the extra degree of gimbal stabilisation and 4K.

Yep and not only do you need a drone license in Japan, you also need a manually issued permit each and every time you want to fly it within Tokyo, specifying the drone type, time, place, duration, etc. Fortunately it’s easy to get out of town on a train to actually use the thing, can’t wait to try it out.

Yeah man! Congrats!! I was thinking the exact same, right now the price premium for the Platinum over the Pro is in no way justified by the marginal upgrade. I also just bought the Platinum’s bent props to add to my Pro, from what I can tell the bent props are the biggest Platinum upgrade that assists with quieter flying, so the only difference now will be a few minutes shorter flying time, which is no big deal for me given these drones return to home when the battery gets around 20%.

A lot of the time it’s good old Bitcoin QR codes
on a mobile, nothing special. Bic Camera have dedicated iPods with the BitFlyer Bitcoin app installed at various terminals and they accept payment from any source wallet. When they calculate the total owed after discounts applied, the clerk asks another one over to validate the total is entered correctly into the app, before presenting the QR code to you for payment. Once a green tick shows up upon receipt of your broadcasted transaction, usually in a second or two, they print your receipt and you’re done. When I’ve had to get a refund for a Bitcoin purchase in the past, they paid me in cash based on the value at the time of purchase.
Note that other retailers who use the BitFlyer app, which appears to be the biggest wallet and transaction processor in Japan, can specify that payment must be from a BitFlyer wallet. Yamada Denki is a competing electronics chain which is overly cautious and mandates use of the BitFlyer wallet (obviously so they can track you down if there are any issues). Fortunately Bic Camera do not and let you use any wallet.
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:01:04
It appears BitFlyer sells immediately for yen on behalf of Bic Camera and credits their account. In any case, you’re better off not recycling addresses and to use new ones each time.

@_date: 2019-04-07 23:46:27
It’s whatever the rate is at the time of purchase. The store clerk first calculates your total in yen, then enters that yen value into their Bitcoin app on a dedicated iPod to request payment in equivalent Bitcoin. You scan that and pay in Bitcoin.

Bic Camera discount applies to anyone and as a non-national you get 8% off tax free as well. Bic Camera accepts Bitcoin at all their stores, but Yamada Denki may only be accepting Bitcoin at a few (I know Shinjuku does). However to spend  Bitcoin at Yamada Denki you need a BitFlyer wallet, which means you need a local residential address and KYC nonsense. Better to go with Bic Camera who accept Bitcoin at all stores and from any wallet.
@_date: 2019-04-07 23:54:21
Yes, all 41 Bic Camera stores across Japan accept Bitcoin payments up to 300,000 yen. You can use any wallet to pay. There are multiple other businesses accepting Bitcoin to, for example a new urban streetwear shop in Harajuku near Deus Ex Machina Cafe also accepts Bitcoin.

No need to wait, they only need to see the broadcast transaction which takes a few seconds normally. Yes, it’s a risk, but one they are willing to take and probably why transactions are limited to 300,000 yen.

Bic Camera initially accepted up to 100,000 yen per Bitcoin transaction, until Yamada Denki (a competing electronics chain) also started accepting Bitcoin up to 300,000 yen per transaction, so Bic Camera matched it. This is why there’s some conflicting information. Also worth noting you can use any wallet with Bic Camera, whereas Yamada Denki are overly cautious and only accept payments from the Bitflyer wallet.
@_date: 2019-04-07 23:49:23

@_date: 2019-04-07 14:19:14
Agree credit card currency exchange fees are ridiculous. Not only do you save that when using Bitcoin here, but I’ve been successful in the past getting a further 5% discount at Bic Camera for using Bitcoin. This is very competitive versus traditional payment methods. Also don’t forget when buying as a non-national in Japan, tax free gets you an instant 8% discount (you don’t pay the tax, no need to claim). Bic Camera also have 7% off repeat customer discount coupons if you can find them, offering 2% more than the Bitcoin discount. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:58:31

I take it they don’t want customers waiting around as they turn over so much business. The risk of a double spend is low enough and they’ve been accepting Bitcoin for over 2 years now, if they had faced any issues they would have stopped by now. But agree, they need to get onto Lightning.

Actually the Fed is currently unwinding QE to the tune of around $54b per month, totalling about $400b of “Anti-QE” last year. 
This could be in anticipation of a future need to print more money to stave off a potential Chinese attack (bond dump), however this also puts upward pressure on interest rates. So in the end the US may enter recession by its own actions, without China doing anything. 
Trump wants to keep the QE printing presses going to devalue the USD against the yuan, to make US exports more competitive, which is why he wants to fire the Fed chair Jerome Powell.
Of course if (or when) things turn ugly the Fed can start money printing again, but it may lead to hyper-inflation next time and the USD finally losing global reserve status. As you point out no one knows where this is heading, we’re in uncharted territory. 
Edit: Don’t forget Russia, China and others are buying as much gold as they can, through official and unofficial channels. Virtually everything mined each year globally and whatever else they can get their hands on. Their gold reserves are now enormous as they know the USD dominance as global reserve currency is coming to an end. They will very likely issue their own gold-backed currencies once the crisis hits. Can the Fed endlessly keep printing billions in unbacked USD under such a scenario?

Be very careful! Owning a gold ETF like GLD is not the same as owning physical gold, it is paper gold with many more owners believing they can claim physical gold than the supposed gold that backs the ETF.  
You also need over $1m invested to make any claim for physical gold and if the GLD decides (or more realistically, the real gold isn’t there), they are allowed to settle in fiat.
You are also trusting multiple custodians without any contract in place, the largest of which is HSBC who are a very dodgy bank, who then hire smaller unknown banks to supposedly hold the gold to back the ETF. 
Gold ETFs are fraught with danger and risk and are essentially part of the banking system to which gold is supposedly a hedge. The only way to get exposure to gold as a hedge is to physically own it, in your hands. The same way you only own bitcoin if you control the private keys.

Many sources, just do a bit of research.  Like simply Google it and you'll find it in mainstream media:
Or regarding China both mining more gold than any other country and also buying more gold than they officially state, to amass an astonishing amount of gold (some estimates at over 20,000 tonnes), far in excess of claimed US reserves of 8,000 tonnes.
Note also that the gold the US claims it has in its possession (both that is US owned and also held on behalf of other nations) is very likely not in US possession anymore and is in China. All evidence suggests it was sold off gradually and illegally, melted down to 1kg bars, which ultimately made their way to China. Hence why the Fed will not allow an audit, or even allow sovereign nations that deposited their gold at the Fed for 'safe keeping' to even inspect their own gold. You may want to look into Germany and other countries demanding their gold back from the Fed. They never get the gold back they originally deposited and it takes an extraordinarily long time for something supposedly sitting in a vault.

China owns $1.17 Trillion in US government debt (Treasury Bonds).
If China simply stops buying US Treasury Bonds it could tank the US economy, especially if the US issues more bonds and it would be worse if China got pissed and decided to dump US Treasury Bonds. 
This would drop the price of US Bonds, which increases their yield (all bonds have a face value they redeem at maturity, if you buy the bond cheaper before maturity, your effective interest rate is higher). This would force US interest rates up, slowing down the economy and likely sparking a recession.

It is true. Many people cannot see this reality yet, but it will happen and will bite hard when the super-recession hits.
The USA will see hyper-inflation with investors fleeing not only stocks and bonds, but also fleeing the US dollar as it increasingly becomes worthless. Traditionally gold has been the go-to safe haven, however the gold market has gotten heavily manipulated with price fixing and the paper gold to physical gold ratio now over 210:1 (gold price manipulated down in an attempt to disguise all the Fed's inflationary money printing and the fact the West has sold off most if its gold reserves). This means for every ounce of gold a person holds, at least 210 others believe they also own that same ounce! Gold is actually very scarce - all gold mined since pre-historic times would fit into an Olympic sized swimming pool. Hence you can see why there will be panic once investors realize unless they hold gold in their hand they don't own it, and will look to safe haven alternatives. Bitcoin is becoming the best alternative.
Over the past week there has been a gold to bitcoin correlation factor of 0.84, suggesting investors are waking up to Bitcoin being a viable "Gold 2.0".  The Wall Street Journal even reported on this: [
Anyone who critiques Bitcoin as not being a valid store of value or safe haven by suggesting it is "too volatile" or "collapsed in 2018" can be pointed to a sequence of Bitcoin's annual \*lowest\* prices.

Exactly. Email didn’t have multiple knock-offs attempting to subvert and dominate (Email Cash anyone?), but with recent news around Lightning’s growth to 600BTC capacity and people using it for real-world super-cheap micro transactions (e.g. using Bitrefil), along with Bitcoin onchain fees at all time lows whilst processing more transactions than all other top-ten altcoins combined, it’s all but confirmed Bitcoin proper is going to change the world, probably much faster than we think.

Wowsers... Bill’s epiphany that the USD is really an ICO for petroleum that countries are forced to use due to our dependence on oil is some frigging amazing thinking! Love it.  Need more intelligent panels like this.
But Charles’  is delusional predicting Ethereum will dethrone Bitcoin. In truth  Ethereum being difficult to code, demonstrably hackable, heavily bloated and premined is at far greater risk of being dethroned by a better Distributed App platform like Lisk.

“In 2019, with the elimination of major disrupters to Bitcoin, it is likely that the Bitcoin ecosystem will thrive in the upcoming year. Already recognized by Time Magazine as a major component that supports freedom in countries like Venezuela, bitcoin has no such restrictions on payments between parties that many other payment processors require. So when Visa, Mastercard and other government backed payment processors try to operate in countries like Venezuela, they lose out to the technologically superior bitcoin payment method. And with the lightning network upgrade, it is possible to pay for a cup of coffee in mere seconds.”

Craig is to Crypto what Steven Bradbury is to the Winter Olympics (Australian’s only gold medalist who only won the ice skating finals because everyone else fell down).
Craig was likely across Bitcoin in the early days, but definitely not instrumental, he lacks the intellect. 
With both Hal and David passing he’s left trying to assert his role in its creation. 
The law suit claims Craig stole files off David’s machine, most of which is almost certainly heavily encrypted, hence why Craig cannot sign anything with the original keys, but has some scraps of data he can use to pretend to be Satoshi, like what he showed Gavin.
Hopefully this all washes out with the law suit and we finally determine the truth.

I feel like they took you for a ride man. Your story would have been much more interesting viewing too. Not saying you should, but you could tip off Media Watch about dodgy ‘journalism’:  The fact is 60 Minutes misrepresented you by declaring an invented high net worth to the world without your consent, possibly putting a target on your back. My guess is they took $10k invested and a 2000 multiple (low BTC price of $10 in 2013 and high of $20k in 2018) to arrive at $20m. That’s pretty fucking reckless on Channel 9’s behalf.

I agree with you. I’m saying it’s oddly particular information to include, as it could prove their book to be a hoax. An agency or PD using this info around his job, mother and grandmother, which I assume is new info as I’ve never heard it before, could narrow a shortlist down very quickly. For example there could not be many book publishing companies on the east coast in the 50s. University computer labs would also be in the hundreds only. Then how many computer lab employees had a grandmother owning a book publishing business? Could only be a few, if that.
@_date: 2018-07-02 09:16:52
That's a big assumption, no one knows for sure. His coins are factored into circulating supply and there's always the imminent threat of any of these 1m coins moving.

FYI this photo was taken at one of the Bic Camera stores in Tokyo last month. Bic Camera are one of the largest electronics merchants in Japan turning over $1 Billion in sales annually. They first trialled Bitcoin payments last year and after an overwhelming success, rolled it out to all their stores across Japan.
Yamada Denki are another large electronics retailer, who after seeing Bic Camera’s success also started accepting Bitcoin. 
At first Bic Camera had a 100,000 Yen limit for Bitcoin purchases, but after seeing success and no issues with 0-conf, both stores have raised their Bitcoin purchase limits to 300,000 Yen (about US$3k per purchase and you can make multiple purchases).
The way it works is you say you want to use Bitcoin, they don’t batter an eyelid as there is Bitcoin signage everywhere and they do this all the time. There are purpose-built Bitcoin POS terminals and the entire process is sometimes faster than using a credit card. You scan the QR code on their desk-mounted iOS device, a tick appears almost immediately upon broadcast, you get two receipts (one for purchase, other for Bitcoin transaction) and you walk out with your new goods. 
It works, so these stores have no need to accept any other crypto and I expect once Lightning rolls out they make adopt that too given the Japanese love to optimize everything by the millisecond.
Bic Camera is my preferred store given they started this mini Bitcoin war with Yamada Denki plus Bic Camera do not mandate use of the BitFlyer wallet. Bic Camera even offers discounts of around 5% if paying with Bitcoin. When added
to a tax-free purchase saving of 8%, the whole
process is so cheap and smooth you may feel like you’re stealing high value electronics as you walk out of the store!

Yes and the Australian government currently only accepts Australian Pesos for tax payment. Other governments globally are beginning to accept Bitcoin for taxes though, including in Arizona.
Perhaps a bigger impact would be any capital gains tax due if crypto is used as payment for a house in Australia. It’s a bit of a grey area, but if you originally bought Bitcoin as an investment and then bought a house with it after it had increased in value, assuming you’d held the crypto for over 12 months you’d owe 50% of your top marginal tax rate applied to the “profit” made in Bitcoin at the time it was “sold” to buy the property. So if your tax rate was 30%, you’d owe 15% of the gains made in Bitcoin.

Anything to do with wealth will attract bad actors only in it for greed - gambling, real estate &amp; Bcash are all examples. 
The misinformation problem stems from Bitcoin having no official central body or mouthpiece, whereas all altcoins aspiring to steal some of Bitcoin’s goodwill for personal greed or otherwise do.

Article reports correlation over the past 5 days, not long, but importantly this is an emerging trend and one the Wall Street Journal feels worthy to publish. In the past during small economic shocks we’ve seen money pulled from stocks and Bitcoin simultaneously and flow into cash or safe haven assets, like gold. We appear to now be seeing money pulled from stocks and shifting to both gold and Bitcoin. In other words, Bitcoin is gradually adopting a safe haven status in the minds of investors, as a Gold 2.0. Also keep in mind cash is increasingly a risky asset to hold due to Fed money printing and risk of inflation, plus gold markets are heavily manipulated with paper gold at a ratio of over 200:1, and hence gold prices are artificially prevented from rising significantly in price. Bitcoin is not so easily manipulated and in many opinions is considered an emerging safe haven asset that may indeed be near perfect (personal control, portability, anonymity, etc).

If the price in $ drops you’ll definitely be happy employing this hedging strategy, but I can’t say I’d be happy having 20% of BTC holdings liquidated should the price keep going up, which long term it is. I guess that’s the price you pay for locking in a dollar value and you could hedge again at a higher price after the first position gets liquidated - but not a strategy worth doing long term if you believe in Bitcoin, if the price keeps increasing you’ll just be continuously decreasing your BTC holding.

I too am constantly amazed by the general ignorance towards this amongst the population, but it’s by design - these banksters intentionally designed their debt-based fiat system to be complex and too difficult to understand. 
Plus this system condemns the average person to endless slave labor with a never reachable goal  of getting debt free. It has also sucked many women and others who don’t want full time soul destroying jobs into endless debt repayment. Many are so exhausted from this they have no capacity to learn about the financial reality within which we live. Their fleeting moments of “freedom” on days off are simply better spent.

I’m cool with some stodgy old holdouts. Vodafone still has a pager business running for only 1000 customers.

Yes, there are traders making such a move. Some Brokers and Advisers are also doing it for themselves, but are currently restricted from recommending Bitcoin to their clients. Want proof? See this guy for starters:

But more than it should be

That’s extremely embarrassing, but good on OpenNode for doing what’s right. With Bitmain winding down it’s not looking good for Bcash ABC/BAB variant.

It's The Decoupling. Aka The Decorrelation. Was always bound to happen, Bitcoin is the most perfect 'safe haven' asset in existence to date.

It’s actually over 80% in reality, but cool

Evidence suggests it’s looking like Bitcoin is *BECOMING* a safe haven asset. Where did anyone state it has been so for the past 24 months? I was stating it’s been a good investment over that period, certainly safer than shares, and that’s the definition of a safe haven.

Wow. It appears your enlightenment also leveled up thanks to Bitcoin. It’s important to be grateful and realize wealth and a “career” aren’t the meaning of life, for which there may be no answer. Just enjoy yourself.

Crypto is already exposing and educating people on central bank manipulation, money printing and the lie that is CPI. A few minutes of reading about Bitcoin enlightens anyone to this and they can then plan to do something about it and prepare for the coming super-recession, whether they buy crypto, help to build infrastructure or not. Those who continue to ignore will continue to be adversely affected, this will be the greatest wealth transfer in human history. Where did I suggest any societal problems would be solved in some ignorant blanket statement?

Great chart. Interestingly there has never been such a large divergence. The closest was in April 2017, about 6 months before the huge Bull run. Does this mean we’re 6 months away from another mid-2019?

Great strategy, but a single point of failure out of your control is Bitmex, what if they screw up, get hacked or do a runner?

Nice analysis, but you won’t want government issued fiat when experiencing hyper-inflation, which you also have never experienced in your lifetime and is most certainly coming.
Where do you store your wealth as inflation rapidly erodes your fiat wealth? 
Under your bed? Your paper is just devaluing rapidly. May end up as your cheapest option for toilet paper.
Bank? Bad idea. Bail-ins are coming. It’s been written into most government law. Plus each dollar still rapidly loses value under hyper-inflation.
Gold? Seems a safe bet, but not so given the insane 233:1 ratio of paper gold (sold on markets, as in ETFs) to real gold. If you don’t physically hold the gold (as per Bitcoin keys), you don’t own it. Governments also have a relatively recent history of compulsory acquisition of your gold.
Property? Bad choice as an economic crisis sees many losing their jobs and selling up.  Banks would also stop lending, which is all that’s propped up property prices this past decade.
Stocks and bonds? Not even going to bother going into this. Forget it under a crisis including a government being unable to fund its debt (as per USA very soon).
You’re correct we haven’t had Bitcoin before a major recession or global financial crisis yet. But given its many benefits including protection against compulsory acquisition, portability, fungibility and more, I’d suggest Bitcoin is most likely to become the new safe haven of choice under a financial crisis. Just as we’re seeing now in Venezuela and previously in Cyprus during their bank bail-in.

Insightful and sane post, thanks.
