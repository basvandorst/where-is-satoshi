The mining process is just a way to distribute the currency gradualy and in a *relatively* equitable way. The difficulty of discovering a new block is arbitrarily readjusted such that as more people mine faster, difficulty goes up, so the overall rate of block discovery stays the same (with the reward halving every so often).
It's an unideal way to distribute a currency, but it's a necessary workaround because there's no central authority to decide how the currency should be distributed. As runeks mentioned, mining also has to verify Bitcoin transactions, because again, there's no central human authority that does so.

Likewise. I signed up with Coinlab to squeeze in a couple months after that point, too, plus whatever they can offer in non-Bitcoin HPC tasks after my credits run out.

Source on closing preorders? This is the first I've heard of it.

Maybe do that in the long term, but right now, I would strongly discourage anyone from "investing" in Bitcoin. Speaking as a miner myself and someone who's watched the market swings off and on for a couple years, it's still entirely too vulnerable to both speculation and simple market panic. The average trading volume is still so small that anyone with a modest pile of money can make a few big sell offers and start a market swing.
When volume increases a lot, the market should stabilize and start acting more like a real, semi-predictable currency market. The way to get there, I think, is to make Bitcoin popular for short-term transactions. For example, it's a great way to transfer between countries while using a common currency.


Heheh. I look at Bitcoin as the prototype for future such currencies. We're learning from its flaws while making a bit of money and dodging credit card/exchange fees on the side.

I hope this. We definitely need to look out for up-and-coming businesses and lend them equal support, so the Bitcoin ecosystem is competitive from the start. And in the US, businesses are gonna need a *looooot* of support to make it over the hurdle of obscure financial regulations.

I played with Diaspora several months back. It was nice but didn't seem to have a niche figured out for itself (besides the obvious technical/ideological benefits). Is it still a thing?

Keep in mind that means running the GPU full-tilt pretty much all the time. Heat, fan noise, and most importantly *electricity costs*. If you're paying for utilities you're almost certainly going to lose money.
I mine in my college dorm right now because I don't have to worry about electricity. Sleeping with all the noise is a pain, though.

To be fair, the pool has some pretty sweet features.
