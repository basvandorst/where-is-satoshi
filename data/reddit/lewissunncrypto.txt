Just like "you haven't lost until you sell" you haven't gained until you sell, you still have X BTC , no matter what BTC is worth. 
You can't say "I lost 100 euros today" because the dollar went down in value, it just doesn't work that way. You have the same amount of dollars as you had in the first place.

My point. I trade and mine for BTC, not for USD. Thankyou

Fair argument, in my eyes the only difference here are the people who view Bitcoin as a currency and people who view Bitcoin as an investment. I personally trade to increase my BTC, I turn off the dollar conversions.

We have some rules in crypto chats that you're only allowed to use satoshis generally. Obviously exceptions are often made.

It has value because people are tricked into buying it

Yeah but the point is that this is bad for the future of Bitcoin. HODLing gives it no value, using it does.

If they hold BTC maybe they want the dollar to go down so BTC is up relative to the dollar

If you need money to do anything you wish to do then I suggest you just do it. I wouldn't say you should sell but only enough to do what you wish.

Yeah, but they took many more with them :) In reality it's a win for the HOLDERS
 There were actually more than 300 greeks there, only 300 Spartans. The Spartans all stayed until their death though due to their religious and loyalty beliefs.
The final 300 were also accompanied by two other states of Greece. I believe one was "forced" to stay due to previously surrendering to the Persians and letting down other states while the other stayed to prove their worth to the Spartans. Keep in mind that at this time Greeks didn't consider themselves as a whole, it was rare for the states to work together unless necessary and conflicts were common. It was only after the invasion of Xerxes that greek alliances were more common.
All in all the Persians wore little to no armour, their shield could stop arrows but it was basically a wicker basket so a spear would tear right through. The Persians also had shorter spears and varying training from very little. There was also an issue of communication of the Persians, being from a wide empire they spoke multiple different languages.
In contrast, the Greek Hoplites wore either bronze or "lamellar" armour, both are either expensive or relatively technologically advanced. These could stop arrows, spear blows and sword slashes. Their shields "the hoplon" would also be bronze with wood internals ( the hoplon was especially significant since the type of grip used within it allows for much easier control of the shield to the extent that it can be used as a weapon.). Their helmets were also bronze and covered most of the face.
Most hoplites weren't too heavily trained but the Spartans were specially trained; taken to what is called the agoge at a young age ( I think around 7 or 9 ) to train for battle until adulthood.
Finally the greeks also chose the position which they held wisely, being a much smaller army they picked a narrow pass which the persians had no advantage over them despite their millitary size.
In the end - Greeks whoop some lightly armoured persian ass until some dude tells the persians how to get around the mountian, persians get behind and whoop some greek ass. Persians move on and whoop some more metallic ass untill they are stopped at the final narrow pass to southern greece and they get their cloth-bearing asses slapped.
**TL;DR:** 
**The metaphor works since there's lots of ass slapping and the hodlers will lose to begin with but the sacrifice is worth it since we rise in the end and invade a while later :)**
No idea why I wrote this, I don't actually have a clue if much of it is right considering it's been years since i've read anything to do with history.
