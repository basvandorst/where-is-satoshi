How are the withdrawal limits set? This is the first I've heard of one this large.

Can we stop blaming this on socialism? This is the result of multiple corrupt governments, not the underlying socio-economic philosophies.

Better to have time in the market than trying to time the market.

Nah, they each pay for 50 bitcoins at market value and put the lot in escrow. Winner takes all.

Can you give us the numbers you have? Cost of panels, equipment, installation?

It looked like this was the first time they had used the app - notice that they had to allow it to access the camera, which is a first-time message. It also would explain why the user was having trouble navigating the app, as they were unfamiliar with it.
When I use my convenience store's app to buy a coffee it's: Open app - click buy stuff - show QR code to cashier - Enter PIN on convenience store keypad. It's not much less complicated than what we just watched, and I do it daily.
One thing that helps a ton with most apps these days is the fingerprint reader - it takes half a second to authenticate instead of entering a pin multiple times. As the readers become more mainstream I think they will help the overall process.
