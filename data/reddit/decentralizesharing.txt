increasing blocksize arbitrarily forces less people to validate tx, also it forces people to upgrade instead of being backwards compatible - so who's trying to force it? why can't btc be most accessible crypto and thus most decentralized instead. we can do layer 2 and layer 3 solutions for coffee easily without reducing decentralization. we have altcoins today for more centralized but faster solutions. it literally doesn't matter where the cap is.

[blocknet]( has been doing the most: BTC, QTUM, DGB, PIVX, NMC, DOGE, MUE, VTC, SYS, LTC, DYN, DASH, VIA
lots of interest for atomic swaps to [bitshares]( blockchain too for trustless gateways right now that btc got segwit
