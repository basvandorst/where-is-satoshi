I'm a working man who has spent a lot of my time and money on bitcoin, and I blog honestly about my experiences.  I've also been successful at it.  Take it for what it is.  I do wonder why you spend your free time badmouthing bitcoin online (I read a lot of your comments).  Oh well.   To each their own! :)

Noted, thanks.  I'll put alt-coin related posts there in the future.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:03:07
Probably the best post I've seen on this yet.  Spot on.

Thanks wowigotlucky.  That's exactly what happened.  He updated the article - sincere thanks for pointing that out.

Are you in the U.S.?  Coinbase.com for sure.

I have to disagree "crashing" isn't the right term.  It's simply down.  Those of us who day-trade bitconin have made some good money on it! :)

Sleep?  That's a secondary concern. ;)

Can't help you there, my friend.  Never used Reddcoins or Cryptsy.

I appreciate your opinion.  As to whether I'm any good at this, you can also see my post on the actual site ( on how I made 20% day trading one day.  I do have some relatively good success with day-trading and short-term btc investments.  Eat the meat, spit out the bones.  It's just one man's opinion.  If you don't like it, feel free to move on.

Hi di0genetic.  I understand what you're saying.  You believe I posted to say I predicted the specific mechanism of the price drop, and that isn't the case.  That was not my intent in the video, nor my philosophy in investing.  My personal philosophy when investing is this: Bad press = great news for bitcoin day traders who believe the currency has a huge future.  I have made that point frequently, and I would refer you to other videos I have made as evidence.  I forget sometimes that people see one video without knowing the context, and it is my mistake in not realizing that is something I should provide.  In my investments, the specific mechanism of why Gox halted trades is far less important to me than the fact that the did, and that there was a selloff (as well as low volume) that made the price drop.  Why?  Because I put more stake in the press than non-devestating setbacks to bitcoin.  Perhaps that is because I'm the marketing manager of a corporation, or just my natural inclination.  It is most important to me that the press talks about how it is "collapsing" and "plunging".  It could have been Obama taking a poop on a bitcoin.  I really don't care what the reason was.  What I want to see is if people are selling, holding, or buying based on what they see in the emotional speculative bitcoin market, as opposed to the actual strength of the marketplace.  That is where I find my strengths and make my best investments.  All in all, I'm up 10% today, and my fellow investors in the group that share this philosophy are up over 20% (they got up an hour earlier than I did).  I hope you are doing well as well.  I'll take this experience and your comments and learn from them.  All the best from one bitcoin fan to another.

Hi elfof4sky!  We usually don't pay for our bloggers, however, your story is intriguing enough that I would be willing to pay a small amount monthly so long as we have an agreement about posting to my blog first with our format, and promoting it with us.  We would need to see some examples of your work as well.  Does that interest you?
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:33:18
I hope you're right!  If it reaches $200 I'm selling my car to buy more! :)  In the mean time, a lot of us are making money day trading, so I'm not quite sure if you are so clever why you don't join us.

In my experience there are certain times of the day that the currency is at it's lowest in a 24 hour period.  So the answer depends on when you buy.  Myself and my friends bought early AM and has still seen a profit today.  However those who bought later may not have.  It just depends, but in general I believe strongly in the currency, and that medium-long term it will be worth far more than it is right now.  So all that to say it depends how long you want to hang onto it, and what your strategy is.  I have both day trading and long-term allowances.

Aah, classy.  Thanks.  So far my IRA is down and my bitcoin is up, so while I welcome your opinion, the math right now is in my favor. Good talk though.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:03:30
 A chance of the USD being worth that as well. ;)  It is still in it's infancy, so there is a definite development stage that needs to happen before the mainstream really gets it.  But the same thing happened with the internet. And I think the concept is just as revolutionary.  My two cents anyway.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:36:15
Thanks - I 'll check it out!

That's a good question.  I made a comment on the post to ask him about the image.  utuxia - just a reminder that this post was from April 10th so the info may be a slightly old.  Not sure if that helps or not.  I will let John comment on any specific questions, as he is the expert.

Not sure why it picked the pizza image from another post on the site. :)  Good article though, Avai.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:42:54
It takes a bit to get the lay of the land.  But you're in the right place to learn. :) Let me know if you have any more questions, I'm happy to help.

Hi twistedonline.  I appreciate your comment.  Please keep in my my post was 3 days ago. As of yesterday no one knew transaction malleability had anything to do with Gox's halt.  In and of itself the problem is not really new to bitcoin, so I didn't think to talk about it at all.  I'll talk about it a bit tonight though since it is a hot topic and extremely relevant with Gox's statement.  Thanks for your comment.

+1 for the Serenity reference. :)
