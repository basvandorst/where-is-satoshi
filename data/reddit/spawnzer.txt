He lowered it to 575 and has only sold 500ish so far, it's gonna be a wild one if he really wants to sell them all
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:18:48
I'm waiting for 400 as well

Assuming no one ask for them back, I can't contact the sender, etc.
Cash in a third of it to buy a house, pay my debts and have fun while holding on the rest in the safest way possible, hoping that bitcoin goes through the roof

You have an extra "d" in there
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:32:15
It's a long shot if it was a couple years ago, but *maybe* it'll find the profile and use it
You have nothing to lose

Yesterday I had enough for a breakfast at McDonalds, but now it's gone D=

I bet they'd be willing to take the whole box of sharpies in the pooper just to have back the btcs they spent

I already have my post ready for when we get a 666th thread about this, which should be pretty damn soon because the new queue is full of that shit

Quick question, can a canadian uses Bitstamp to buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:22:39
I have some fractions of a bitcoins on an account that weren't even worth a cent up until recently
Too bad I can't even move it because it's still too small lol
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:14:20
IMO the best is to follow the bitstamp price using [bitcoinity](

How much can you afford to lose?
