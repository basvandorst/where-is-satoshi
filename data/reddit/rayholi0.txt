I believe  a misconception is in play.
BTC ATMs are not ATMs at all imo.  When bitcoin reigns, there will be no need for them.  While fiat will always need ATMs.
These are BTC exchange machines...  all they do is convert crypto into fiat.  Then fiat into crypto.  As crypto gains market share with vendors, it will lose market share at ATMs.  
Comparing exchange rates to ATM rates is very apples to oranges.  
The % is ridiculous, true..  but I’m not basing that on ATM fees...  I’m basing it on online purchase fees.

The world trusts you to learn by doing...  your parents do not.  
Ignore them.    As a parent, I want my kids to make (or lose) as much money as possible as soon as possible.   The experience is priceless at your age.

I don’t remember eGold..  PayPal was just to support p2p transactions..  I don’t think it was competing with the dollar.
Googled it; eGold was based on a real world standard...   I appreciate the similarities though!  Started in 1996..  shut down in 2009 by gov.  Bitcoin addressed both problems nicely.

The 90s?   I was there..   everyone knew this stuff..     “the internet super highway” was promised to be all of this and more.  
The service and media providers were trying to figure out how to get the Masses to adopt.      Online stores and newspapers were available..   but no one would use them.  Only 20 somethings sitting at their 60 gallon monitors.  Kids don’t spend enough money to justify the roll out.
Turns out that it only took smart phone deployment to popularize these services.  
We were not blind to this stuff (at least the younger generation wasn’t). 
Kinda like dna manipulation and these newer bio-technologies that promise to change our lives again.   We see it coming now...  we just don’t have the infrastructure to deploy it.
True.   We didn’t see digital currency coming..  or pot legalization.  LOL!

As I understand it, 50 billion dollars a month is being removed from the USD supply through bonds not being renewed.     
That’s at least an element.

Is he grabbing his hard-on as he talks about crypto?
