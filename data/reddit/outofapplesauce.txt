The idea that currencies should be gold backed was/is traditionally but backed by no logic or reason.  It could just as easily be backed by moose antlers and have equal worth.

The point of gold being used in currency was because it was hard to fake, and many ways to test it for authenticity to stop forging.
Modern paper and digital currency are equally difficult to recreate with many ways to test authenticity.  Gold isn't magical, and isn't inherently valuable outside of very specific applications.

Uh what?


Even then that's just wrong.  Inflation isn't new, we just understand it's effects better now.  Many times gold has risen and dropped drastically in value.  Mansa musa is the most obvious, but even the effects of the Cluny monastery had adverse affects on the value of gold.

Sometimes I forget where I am that shit like this gets posted.  Trust and agreed on value is what makes currency.  In the past only gold could have that agreed upon trust.  Not so much any more.  Simple as that.  Also go post what you just said in any economic or financially literate ^subreddit and see the replies.

This is just false, value of gold fluctuates greatly over time, even a basic google search will show you that.

Eh, but that can be easily proven false when you look at the price of other goods during dramatic shifts in gold markets.  If the value of a dollar decreased,  gold prices wouldn't be the only thing to increase in value.
