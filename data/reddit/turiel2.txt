This is actually much more effective. 5,000 or even 50,000 signatures means nothing when a company has 14 million users. However because almost nobody leaves reviews and they're given such prominence on the app stores, even a couple of hundred of bad reviews can be super effective.

You have to watch it in the right mindset. It's not a show to watch while you're trying to chill or relax. Watch it when you're wide awake (woke af ;)) ready to focus all your attention on it. Every small thing, from dialogue to tiny set pieces in the background have meaning and if you're not really paying attention you miss much of the point of it. And read the post-episode discussion on Reddit after each episode, because you've likely missed 30 things.
If that sounds like way too much work for a TV show, I can appreciate that, and it's probably not for you.

I have a question around tracking your portfolio. I use CoinTracking dot info.
When I imported data originally, it by default ignored my fiat deposit. This means my currency balance is €-XXX after using it all to buy coins. 
I was fine with this because it meant my "Total Account Value" showed my (unrealised) profit only while "Total value of all coins" was my portfolio balance. Everything makes sense.
Now, I sold half my portfolio and I'm holding fiat in my account and this isn't shown on CoinTracking. It's as if everything just halved with no matching gain (fiat). 
Am I doing it wrong? Or just thinking about it wrong?

Yeah, Coinbase investigating themselves means fuck all, but simply the association of the words "Coinbase" and "Insider Trading" together from media outlets is hugely damaging.
Coinbase's backers, who are silicon valley VCs, are *very* sensitive to any sort of scandal.

I hold both because Coinbase didn't give me an option.
(yeah I know, my own fault)

The problem with reselling is that you are an untrusted party. You could modify the device to steal crypto. This is the case for at least some of the Trezor/Nano devices that are sold on Ebay and Amazon.
Anyone knowledgeable will advise to buy direct from the vendor only.

A fully realised quantum computer would break cryptography as we know it, destroying Bitcoin and all computer security in existence.

Europe is so diverse, it's difficult to classify it like this.
Germany may be reluctant to take on new technology, but at the same time Berlin is one of the best startup hubs in the world.
UK is the world leader in fintech innovation.
Estonia is a world leader in civic technology innovation (e-residency)
Portugal has the highest rate of science graduates per capita in the world.
I could go on, but you get the point. And you're still right about your Italian experience, but it's just so diverse that in this respect I don't think you can classify Europe as one entity.

You can launch from the ocean. Several companies are doing this already. No govt permits required (unless you're a US citizen).

It would be legal for China to do so, and no it would not be an act of war (unless of course the rocket is targeted at the US). And it's not exactly "rolling up to the coast" as intl waters is about 200 miles out.
In Europe, Russia goes up to the border of countries regularly and does military exercises. The exercises are even specifically things like "lets simulate invading Poland". There's a diplomatic stink, but it's not illegal.
The US is a teensy bit more aggressive than Europe though, so you're also right in that they would probably not allow it, but the action against a ship in intl waters by the US would be illegal. They'd still do it though. 
Here's an article about sea launches:

Soundcloud, Zalando, Delivery Hero, SumUp, Blacklane
And of course, Rocket Internet, the most successful startup cloner in the world (maybe there's a better way to describe it..)
And if you haven't heard of any of these, that's ok, but they're still billion dollar companies (or nearly there).

*SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets*
So no, they haven't achieved their ultimate goal, but it's a 50 year goal (for a fully self sustaining colony on Mars).
