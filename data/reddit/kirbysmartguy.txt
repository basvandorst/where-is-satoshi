I think they could still do that by rebuying all of the cheap coins after the noobs sell because the price is dropping. Then the big dawgs go long from the "crash" price and still win.

A little song I love to associate with bitcoin. From Gwinnett county's own, Migos.

I have dumb, stubborn friends like this too. Oh well, not everyone can get rich.

You'll have an equal amount of BCH to what you had at that fork in August.

maybe on one exchange for like a minute. Market cap is just coins available times the current price. So at the peak, the $55mill in coins they sold amounted to about .00018% of market cap. The effect would be like a fart in a wind tunnel.

gotta take the victories, however small. after a drop like we just had, things can get tough. Its not going to gain 100% in a day at these prices.

While past performance means nothing for the future. It is hard to shake the trends BTC has had for the last 8 years

It says they sold 5104 coins for $55 mill. you realize the Bitcoin market alone was in the tens of billions in Dec 2017? That wouldn't have any effect.
