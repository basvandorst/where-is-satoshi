The Australian government should be ashamed of themselves, driving our startup technology businesses offshore is a crime in my books.

Something like $20 in bitcoin might be their entire net profit on 1 oz. I would assume the vast majority of their customers buy multiple oz at a time so although it's only $1/oz their average transaction might be 10 to 15 oz.

**FIRST THING** you should do is make a backup of your wallet.dat before going any further, to safe guard your coins.  
Second step would be to export your private keys and import them into another wallet, I do not have experience with this but I'm sure someone else commenting will.

As long as you originally sent the bitcoin from a wallet such as Qt or Electrum it would have immediately created a change address behind the scenes in the client and returned the change. 
The issues only arises when you import a paper wallet to a client and do not move 100% of the funds out of it in one go, as paper wallets cannot create change addresses so any remainder not sent in the first transaction will be lost.

**Capital Funds**
**Adequacy:** The initial level of capital should be sufficient to support the proposed business plan and the bank’s risk profile. Initial capital should cover operating losses before the bank attains sustained profitable operations, as well as provide a cushion against unexpected losses. Capital for the new bank is also expected to finance and support future growth prospects, such as the establishment of branches. Realistic plans should be developed to access additional capital if needed. The prevailing economic environment should also be considered. Moreover, lending limitations on new banks, based on total capital funds, are more restrictive than limitations imposed by statute or regulation.
The Department expects capital for a de novo bank to remain at or above the well capitalized level for the first seven years; the bank should maintain a ratio of Tier I capital to total assets of not less than 8% for the first seven years.  
  
  
While the adequacy of initial capital will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, Department experience indicates that **minimum capital needs of new banks in the New York Metropolitan area range upward from $50 million**, net of pre-opening expenses. New banks in upstate New York typically require less initial capital.  
  
**Shares and Distribution:** The number of shares, their par value and subscription price, the adequacy of surplus to absorb pre-opening costs and operating losses in the initial years, and the amount of stock to be purchased by the incorporators and directors and any known large investors.

Mycellium might correctly return the change but not all wallets do.


I would say that once the public key is broadcast to the network on the first transaction there will be no further degradation of key security from that point on, why would reboradcasting the pub key lead to less security than you already have once it is know to the network?

Coinbase is not an exchange (yet). They are simply a company that sells you btc and also hosts wallets.
To set buy orders you will need to use a proper exchange such as btc-e.
Also please remember to get your coins out of btc and into your own control immediately.

More than 400 of the people I tipped in this thread did not previously have a Changetip wallet, so yes its doing its bit for adoption.

Nah it's completely broken English in all of their correspondence. To be fair a lot of people a while back would have said don't use btc-e use mt gox instead but they really have stood the test of time.

Just a PSA I remember a Trojan being included with the DB dump, although I know you were joking we wouldn't want someone to go looking for it now would we.

This might sounds silly, but I would not even consider selling them sub 40k a coin.
I see the true potential, its massive.

Can you elaborate on this, I'm interested in running a full node to support the network. Is it as easy as me buying one of these obsolete miners?

I would have thought the easiest way would be to set a buy order at say $195 on btc-e or another exchange.
@_date: 2015-02-04 07:34:52
I've been wracking my brain but I just can't see to come up with a simple and easy way around this that would take all of .5 second..

If you can't find it yourself on Google, it likely no longer exists
EDIT: I can't see why either of those two sites would not do the job you need them for..

Yes, just like when they were $11 each in Jan 2013 and some said "I bet they will hit $1200 in the next 12 months". 
I bet that sounded ridiculous as well.

Wow.. have not checked the price of LTC in so long.
I'm **REALLY REALLY REALLY** glad I sold all my 130 LTC when they were $41 each..

Wait, you're telling me they have found a way to seize my bitcoins without my private key? /s
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:45:42
Wrong ;)

I fail to see a method below where the government could confiscate your properly secured private key.
