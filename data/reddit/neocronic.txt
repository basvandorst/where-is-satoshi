Basically, they're taking advantage of the fact that bitcoin's value has drastically gone down in the past few days. It doesn't seem worth it, and it would make more sense to just wait a few weeks for the price to go back up.

It's possible that they could, or whoever they're using to convert currencies could be giving them a bonus for it. Otherwise, why would they care if people used bitcoins, and why would they give you a discount for using them?
Either way, I think you'd actually save more money if you just waited a month or so and just spend your bitcoins at the normal rate.

Most of the time, the rebates don't even go through.

Thanks! I started to try this, but lost interest after like 5 minutes.

I used it. I had my bitcoins by the time I got home. I had it deposited directly into my wallet.

Good thing they think about things.

I've used bitinstant to both convert USD to BTC and BTC to USD. It was pretty easy and very quick.

If they do offer a security feature that blocks transactions after a password change, they should be able to respond to an intrusion within that timeframe, otherwise what's the point?

Use localbitcoins.com and deposit into a person's bank. That's why there's the escrow, and you lock your price in when you commit to buy. The price is just going to keep going up, so a slightly higher price isn't going to affect you much. You also will likely lose out just waiting for your money to clear on an exchange.

And what's their market share at these days? It seems to be declining rapidly as they continue to release proprietary hardware and software. Most of the innovation these days comes from the free software community.
