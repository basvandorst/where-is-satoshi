Is it possible to calculate the velocity of Bitcoin? (In Macroeconomic terms)
EDIT: Thank you everyone for your answers :-) Very interesting points mentioned!

Thank you very much for your feedback! My potential title and theses are a simple launching pad (just like your suggested topics, which might provide useful quantitative data). I will use them to mold a work that will (hopefully) reflect the changes and waves Bitcoin is creating in the field of currencies and alternative currencies.
Several issues such a deflation and security might prevent future pan-adoption. But through time, I might discover while Bitcoin won't work and how other cryptocurrencies may in the future. 
This, for me, is the fascinating thing about Bitcoin. It has an evolutionary nature and I am working on it in the midst of its early years!

Hey Barney_Craggs, 
Thank you for your input and your offer! I've been picking up sources over the past few weeks and will definitely delve into Nakamoto's original work as a starting point.
I've most certainly noted down your info and look forward to contacting you when I establish a solid base for discussion!
All the best,

Hey everyone,
(1) Are there method(s) or software(s) to quickly scan/take data from the blockchain (for a specific time frame, rather then the whole blockchain)? 
(2) Are there any other analytical tools that could be useful for empirical analysis of the blockchain?
Thanks in advance!

Thank you so much for such a thorough response! You have left me with things to ponder about :-) Very, very insightful!

I am studying the fields of International Political Economy with a background in Economics, International Relations, and Politics in the program International Economic and Political Studies.
I think there is much to say in economics, particularly in the finance (financial system, banking system, central banks). The literature is quite sparse on what we take for granted in the creation and functioning of money.
My first step after introducing and presenting the Bitcoin will be to apply it to the 'traditional functions of money'. First step before stepping into any of my possible theses.
Thank you for the work of Mr. Šurda. His work merits praise and is a source of inspiration!

Thanks a lot for your response! I will definitely look into those :)

Thank you both! Yes justabtcnoob, this is what I want to address. I do not want to make it a press release, but rather and objective 'overview', which would be much more expansive in a PhD dissertation. I will therefore, be sure to mention both the pros and cons of BC.

You might also want to address how many of the 'cons' have been/are being addressed as Bitcoin takes on some age. 
e.g. 
-growth of its acceptance as a means of payment (Overstock -&gt; Dell -&gt; PayPal)
-Bitcoin's use for criminal activities (Silk Road trial, sell-off of seized bitcoins, Mt. Gox users finally getting some of their money back)
For the sake of academic writing, it would be good to address some of its weaknesses too (depending on your academic level and the extent of your essay).
I'm currently writing my Masters thesis on Bitcoin, so if you need academic sources, pm me what aspects of Bitcoin you are writing on and I can send stuff your way.

Thank you! This is exactly what I needed!
