The only reason fiat doesn't have crazy volatility is because it has been fully adopted.  Nobody knows why green pieces of paper have value, but they accept them.  Once bitcoin is simple and easy to use (lightning network with super easy apps), adoption will rise and volatility will decline.  Bitcoin is superior to fiat in terms of decentralization, limited supply, and censorship resistance.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:51:15
Depends what kind of crisis it is and when it happens.  At this stage, too many people still view bitcoin as a speculative asset, rather than a store of value and flight to safety asset.  But over time I think that perception will change (as adoption is more widely proliferated).
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:21:46
I agree this is going to be a multi-decade process.  Our whole world is built around fiat and it's ain't gonna change anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:29:09
WE CAN DO IT!
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:45:04
Bingo.  And for those that think they can trade and make more bitcoin... ok, good luck.  You can day trade stocks too if you want.  Many have tried.  Few survive.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:38:33
Correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't a user be able to buy bitcoin directly into a lightning enabled wallet, from an exchange that has bitcoin in a lightning channel already?  Hence a new user would never have to interact on-chain or "fund" their channel?  I'm curious how exchanges will adapt.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:21:20
Seems like most people are still buying the garbage coins in hopes of hitting it big.  At this point I think we have to just wait for the network effects of bitcoin to take hold, and for everything else to kinda die off into obscurity.  Look at the value moved across the network (not the exchange trading volume) as an indicator of real network value.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:56:27
Problem I have with most alts is they're not nearly as secure as bitcoin, and not nearly as decentralized.  But hey, all people care about is price per coin right now.  Eventually I think those advantages will win out.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:55:09
Except with LN bitcoin would theoretically have next to zero fees as a medium of exchange, and would still be king as store of value.  But we'll see what happens.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:20:14
True.  Bitcoin could go down to $1k and a lot of people would still be firmly in the black.  I'm not one of those people.  But with any price rise you have to be prepared to take the inevitable downswings.  Most people who got into bitcoin last year have not seen an 80% collapse, and hopefully will not have to.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:36:27
The custodian problem is the issue.  Who holds the keys, what happens if they're lost?  Who gets sued?  Who pays to refund the lost coins?  Gets pretty hairy for investment firms.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:06:21
I don't see how money can be improved on after fast, cheap, decentralized, censorship resistant and anonymous, which I believe bitcoin will soon be.  And with bitcoin's network effect advantage, I don't see how another coin beats it for the money use case.
I can sorta see the use case for a token for something like decentralized data storage.  You pay BTC to buy the native token to buy storage on that platform.  I want to see an actual real-world implementation though before I really buy into it.

Its always been like this unfortunately.  The poor get the shaft.  The rich get richer.  It takes money to make money, etc.  As a private company they have the right to do whatever they want, but I'm happy we're building a better world with bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:39:32
I'm no expert in this area, but my understanding is with closed source, the firmware cannot be verified to make sure there is no malicious code.  You have to trust the manufacturer.  With open source, anyone can view the code, which exposes the code but provides total transparency.  If there is a flaw, it will be pointed out by the community.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:04:45
They are.  I'm just explaining why I don't see $1k as a likely price. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:24:53
What's great about bitcoin is that it doesn't matter if you're liberal or conservative.  Basically everyone likes sound, decentralized, censorship resistant money.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:26:14
I'm in the same boat - BTC as digital gold backed by the most secure, most decentralized network.
I think smart contracts are great - as layer 2 options with bitcoin.  My concern with ETH is the coding complexity and bug vulnerability, along with its benevolent dictator model.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:57:51
When we went from like $5k to $2k, it stung but wasn't nearly as big a deal.  When you get to higher numbers, the stakes clearly get raised.

Taleb is big on robust systems, and especially antifragile ones.  Bitcoin is still a work in progress, but has shown characteristics of a robust and antifragile system thus far.  It gets stronger the more people beat up on it and talk about it (whether positive or negative).
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:44:19
I'm not a developer so my knowledge is limited, but I do have concerns about the 2nd layer.  Is it possible to create a fully secure LN?  
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:24:10
Correct.  I think most people would be receptive to the idea that freedom of speech should apply to money as well.  Sending or collecting money should not be a crime.  The problem is that government has hijacked the financial system in the sake of "national security" and "anti-money laundering".  It's all total BS.  I should be able to keep my money private, and send or receive it privately whenever I wish.  On the contrary, transactions of government entities are the ones that should be fully transparent for accountability purposes.  Enter bitcoin.  It just so happens that bitcoin solves a host of other issues, like being globally transferable, a better store of value due to limited supply, etc.  Basically bitcoin has something for everyone.  The whole idea is absolute genius and I'm thankful to be alive now to witness it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:21:01
Isn't opening one channel sufficient to exchange with anyone on the network through a few hops?  I do understand the exchanges wanting to store the majority of coins in cold wallets for security, but I don't see why they couldn't also operate on the second layer for daily deposits/withdrawals.

Anybody who supports bitcoin should not be using coinbase until this issue is resolved.  Credit them for onboarding and building the initial speculative hype for bitcoin, but they've been totally counterproductive from the technical side.  The Bcash fiasco was clearly malicious.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:38:01
I'm fully aware that I could be wrong, but I'm ok with that because I believe in the advantages of bitcoin.  To each his own.  It's a conviction bet for me with high upside.  If it goes to zero, fine. 
High 5 figures.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:34:49
Yeah we'd probably need advances in terms of LN to enable instant, virtually free transactions for billions of people.  Should be interesting to watch.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:36:20
Just use Gemini and do ACH transfer.  Money is available instantly up to $500 a day.  You just have to have the money in your bank account, which is fine.  Nobody should be piling up debt to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:50:16
Anything that forces our government to eliminate waste and actually provide tangible benefits to the people is great imo.  We don't need to be the world's policemen.  We don't need all these welfare/redistribution programs (there are charities for people in need).  Simplify government to focus on enforcing sensible laws, and providing public infrastructure, etc.  Right now we have a corrupt and opaque system that encourages abuse of power.  But we could go on and on about this.

The game can go on for a while, but eventually enough people get burned and say "that's enough".  My concern is so many people will get burned trading these worthless alts that they'll lose confidence in bitcoin and never come back.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:26:51
To me that's no different than rewards points or airline miles.  If it's not decentralized, I don't see the point.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:24:39
We've been in decline ever since futures trading basically.  But I just don't see any way the price goes to $1k given the supply/demand imbalance.  There just aren't enough coins compared to how many people would be buyers at those levels.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:29:45
Alts are already irrelevant, but the market hasn't realized it yet.  
Unfortunately bitcoin may be the baby getting thrown out with the bath water.  I'm a big long-term believer in BTC, however when I see 170 coins worth over $100 million, it seems clear we're in a bubble.  Can bitcoin rise while everything else dies off?  I'm not sure.
Can anyone explain to me the value of a token if it doesn't represent actual ownership in a business, and is not used as currency?  Why would I need a token to use a platform, when I can just use BTC as the currency?
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:35:37
hahaha yeah ok.  Put BTC's user base on BCH (and multiply it in the future) and let me know how that goes.  No worries though I'm sure Rog is busy working on that 16 mb hard fork!  Put a little gum on that leak, should be all set!  Lmao
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:45:29
I guess I don't see it as risky from the standpoint that I don't believe in anything else.  If a centralized shitcoin beats out bitcoin, oh well, I don't want to be a part of it anyways.

Because a lot of people who would like 1 bitcoin can afford to pay and will pay $1k for one.  There aren't enough coins to go around.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:27:15
People laugh and it may never happen, but there's no reason it can't.  Look where we've gotten so far with virtually zero institutional involvement.  There's just so little supply that as you get these demand shocks (like we saw last year), the price shoots up exponentially.  Imagine once BTC becomes widely accepted by merchants, etc.  It then becomes more mainstream, achieves institutional support as a legitimate investment / store of value, which reduces salable supply even more, and it churns on until everyone owns some, like everyone owns a facebook account.  Everyone can own some bitcoin, but not everyone can own a coin at $10k each.  There simply isn't enough supply.  Nobody knows what can happen, but bitcoin is like a call option with huge upside and limited downside.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:39:23
At best, bitcoin is a monetary revolution that will flippen existing societal structures.  At worst it's a lotto ticket with favorable odds, in a world where people are desperate for hope.

I don't think it necessarily has to include surveillance.  But I mean let's be honest 99% of people aren't downloading mycelium or samourai wallet and figuring this stuff out.  Obviously the network itself is not ready yet for the 99% anyways, but just curious how this plays out in 5-10 years.

The idea is that as a centralized entity they like control, and they can't control bitcoin.  So yes by sabotaging it they can try to pump BCH and ETH, the former having been listed out of the blue last month with no warning, leading people to believe insider trading was involved.  BCH is controlled by a select few individuals and the coinbase CEO seems to be ideologically aligned with them.

In reality, no, not likely.  But ideally, if everyone switched over to bitcoin, their ability to collect taxes could become much more difficult to enforce.  At some point we could potentially have a government based on donations rather than extortion (taxes).

You don't need to teach me bud, I've got a pretty strong background in finance and investments.
You seem to think regulation is what keeps the world going round.  The most basic point of bitcoin is it doesn't require trust.  The price volatility is not caused by lack of regulation, it's caused by the fact that it's a relatively small, worldwide market.  
Pumping and dumping?  Ok, go ahead.  It's harder to move the needle when larger numbers come into play.  You either have the bitcoin or you don't.  
Calculated risk?  How bout a 90% risk I lose $10k, vs. a 10% chance I make $990k?  If you don't like the odds, that's cool, don't play the game.  If you do but are afraid of risk, set your allocation % accordingly.  And if you think computer simulations, VAR, etc. are indicative of future results, maybe you weren't around in 08/09.

Point is there's 1 site that took over.  There's no need for another version of facebook (unless somebody could do it better - decentralized and without censorship would be nice - but at this point people are fully invested in FB).  There's no need for 1000 currencies.  And the key is that none of the alts can replicate the organic decentralized growth of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:23:15
You knew this was bound to happen.  The powers that be are not going to like people loading cards with cash from bitcoin, as opposed to going to centralized exchanges to sell, where they can be monitored by authorities.
This highlights the need for LN which will dramatically increase merchant acceptance.  Add on additional privacy features and we're good to go boys.  Course, then they'll try to outlaw anonymity features.  It's gonna be a long battle...

As I understand, the network naturally encourages everyone to play fairly, or you risk losing all committed funds.  Stability and security will have to be good enough for people to have confidence in it. I'm not knowledgeable enough on how exactly that is achieved.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:08:59

Yes because they're intrigued by the asset and want some exposure.  Not to mention the diehard believers who would buy far more than 1.  $1k is minimal risk for significant exposure to a potentially world-changing asset/currency/technology.

As much as I don't want bitcoin to go through these pump n dump cycles, it needs to get mainstream attention to succeed, and what better way than wild price swings?  I'd rather see average Joes in it before rich pricks from Wall Street.  Advising people to invest no more than 5% of assets seems pretty sensible.  Averaging in over several months or a year is another way to protect oneself from the volatility.

I have a Trezor, never had any issues.  I like the open source aspect and they were quick to make Bcash and Bgold forks available.

Personally I don't see the big concern, even assuming tether is a fraud.  Think of it this way, a lot of other worthless tokens have billion+ market caps and can be used to buy bitcoin or anything else.  It's not good, that's for sure.  But is it devastating long-term?  I don't think so.

Talk about a total scam artist.  He knows BCH can't stand on its own 2 feet, so he's doing everything he can to steal the bitcoin brand.  In ordinary business, it would be illegal.  But crypto is the wild west for better or worse.  
Stealing the twitter handle was another predictable move coming from the con-man, but anyone who is knowledgeable sees through this stuff.  It's similar to the altcoin ponzis and pump n dump schemes going on.  Con-artists see lots of opportunity in the space right now.  Lots of fraudulent marketing on social media, etc. to lure people in.  We have to help educate our friends and family.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:41:50
If some of them really succeed, I agree that will keep people lured in.  My concern is what if none of them succeed?  What if the only real use case is money, which bitcoin dominates at?
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:40:41
Lots of newbies don't understand this.  There's literally no long term reason for any altcoin.  Once LN is implemented, and privacy is added, that's the ballgame.  Greatest network effect combined with maximum decentralization, security, privacy and affordability = game over.

Bcash is a centralized scam of a coin run by con-men.  If anyone honestly believes that it will receive worldwide adoption over bitcoin they should be moved to a psych hospital.

Bitcoin can do everything we want it to do on the 2nd layer (instant, cheap, private).  Not to mention bitcoin is the most secure blockchain with by far the greatest network effects.
If you want to talk about tokens for decentralized platforms, ok maybe.  But in terms of money, bitcoin will have that use case locked up.  That's my thesis for owning bitcoin.

Are there known issues/problems that exist with LN, or are we kinda testing for unforeseen bugs?  
Dumb question - what happens if we identify an issue that needs to be corrected?  How easy is it to "update/modify" the network?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:42:27
Fair enough.  Keep in mind that over time it gets distributed to new users.  As people gain wealth they want to enjoy their life - you can't take it all with you.  Wealth isn't just measured in currency either, there are a lot of other assets one can hold and have considerable wealth without holding much actual currency.
I do not believe a centralized world currency will ever work.  Frankly, I can't believe the Euro is still around.  Central banks love to manage currency, but it's hard to do when you've got multiple different countries/economies under one umbrella.  Good luck getting the whole world to agree.  That's why I believe the only chance we have is for it to happen organically, like with bitcoin.  Not to mention the superiority of bitcoin in terms of limited supply, decentralization, and censorship resistance.  It's superior to fiat, but will it take off?  Once businesses start to demand payment in BTC (due to it being a better SOV), we'll have our answer. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:44:05
Well my thought is it allows more businesses/individuals to operate basically as cash businesses, which are harder to track for tax purposes.  Your big companies and stuff will continue to abide by the rules I'm sure.

But will he?  Or will the price hit $10k and then bounce back above $13k?  
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:06:08
It's kinda like "investing" in Euros or Yen, except there's a hard cap on the amount in circulation, nobody can censor transactions, and you can be your own bank.  The key is managing your risk so 80% declines in value don't bother you.  This thing goes through huge boom and bust cycles.

@_date: 2018-01-22 22:12:25
I don't get your question.  The only difference between now and $1k is a lot more people can afford a whole bitcoin at $1k.  I don't think there is enough supply to satisfy the demand at $1k per coin.  As it is, people are currently paying $10k.   Simple supply and demand.

The value lies in a global consensus currency, decentralized and uncensored, and limited in amount.  It will be a huge improvement over government fiat, if scaled correctly.  Problem is like you said, many newbies look at it like a hot stock, a get rich quick scheme.  The only money they know is government fiat.

I don't like high fees, but the counterargument is that so many people are using bitcoin that they're willing to pay those high fees.  Sort of a good problem to have.  Let's get the big players to enact segwit, and trust the devs to get off-chain scaling done as fast as safely possible.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:21:25
With bitcoin, investments just need a much higher ROI to be pursued. This encourages the right kind of investment as opposed to waste and speculation.  Keep in mind, if bitcoin ever was to become a global currency, you would not be seeing value swings like we have now, because it would be fully adopted.

The addition of BCH was material nonpublic information which clearly leaked to the market beforehand.  Then they rashly open trading without even building an order book ahead of time.

In reality this is why most people don't like bitcoin and aren't in it.  They're upset they "missed out", and/or fear they will be disadvantaged because they aren't in it.  Simple solution:  Put 1-5% of your assets in it!  Minimal downside, huge upside.

People are just frustrated.  We don't want to "lose business" to other coins with cheap fees.  We've heard about scaling solutions like LN for quite a while now but no real-world implementation yet.  Now that cryptos are going mainstream it would be great if we had our fullest and best infrastructure up and running.  Unfortunately it's not that easy.  If one just wants to move money cheaply, there are other coins.  Bitcoin has a unique problem of a tremendous user base.  But first and foremost we want to maintain security and decentralization.  Without those aspects, cheap transfers are irrelevant in the long run.
Let's hope 2018 brings rapid advancement in LN and other applications.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:58:40

"Better" is pretty subjective.  Bitcoin has by far the largest network, and largest daily transaction value.  It has the best developers.  At the end of the day it's going to be pretty hard to up-end it.  The bitcoin protocol can be improved as we go along.

I can legitimately see half a million, which would only equal the market value of gold.  Above that, it would have to really take over as a currency with lightning network, etc.  By that point virtually all stores would accept bitcoin, etc.

It's huge, basically every internet gaming site uses bitcoin.  Prior to bitcoin, deposits and especially withdrawals were a nightmare due to the anti-gambling regulations.

Coinbase doesn't even know how to balance the market at open.  It's amateur hour over there.  Whatever you do, don't put in a market buy order - make sure it's a limit buy (if you're actually into buying BCH that is).

For real-world use it has to be easy and cheap to use.  That's the key, and hopefully with LN we have that soon.  Those of us already here are believers in sound money, decentralization, censorship resistance, etc., but unfortunately that's not enough to motivate your average person, which will be required in order to gain mass worldwide adoption.

@_date: 2017-12-13 21:35:04
Problem is the fee is not a %, it's based on the size of the transaction in bytes, not $ amount (I'm no expert though).  If you're sending thousands, the % will be low.  Send less than $100, you're better off with other options.  Looking forward to LN!  I'm all for a secure, decentralized network, but we need to get this sucker opened up.  I will say I'm impressed at the prices people are willing to pay to move BTC though.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:53:42
The only way government gets into the action is when you swap BTC for dollars.  They put the noose around the centralized exchanges requiring them to provide data on who traded what.  Again we go back to the whole beauty of bitcoin - total decentralization.
At a certain point the world economy will be based in BTC, and government will be funded via donations.  Nobody is going to want government fiat.  Why would they?
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:32:21

Companies already offer discounts for using BTC because they don't have to pay the CC fees.  I'll take a 5 or 10% discount on BTC over 2% cash back on my credit card once lightning is enabled with negligible fees.  Thinking more about this, I think it could be a game-changer for people simply looking to save money.

@_date: 2018-05-24 16:45:24
It's up to the community to evangelize for bitcoin, explain why it's so important, and explain why altcoins are inferior.  My concern is that with all of the garbage altcoins out there, and the complexity of setting up a wallet and storing BTC, people just won't bother with it.  Then again maybe BTC is just a niche store of value, on a much smaller scale than gold.  I hope that's not the case, but we have to be honest with ourselves.

@_date: 2017-08-18 19:13:56
Problem is you need some sense of stability if you want mass adoption.  Having 2, 3, 4, 5 versions of bitcoin does not lend itself to stability.  Personally I'm not a huge fan of the 2mb switch, but let's just stick with the agreement and move forward from there.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:38:03
I see what you're saying.  That would require some very complex (i.e. smart) robots though.  I'm not sure AI can be avoided.  Plus, human desire for power/control/ownership would likely make such a scenario unstable.  
That said, advancement in automation is without question a good thing for human standard of living (despite short-term job disruption, etc.)
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:20:37
Interesting philosophical concept.  But who owns the robots?  If I do, why would I send them over to build your house as opposed to building someone else's house?  Nowadays, and for the forseeable future, the answer is money.  I can use that money to buy the service of someone else's robots.
And once robots are smart enough to essentially develop consciousness, why would they want to build houses for humans?  Why not eliminate humans and live out their own dreams?

Problem is people are really dumb.  Just look at the proliferation of alts.  I don't have faith that the general populace will wise up and realize that bitcoin is the only alternative (and not the million other "cryptos").  I'd love to be wrong but for now we're stuck with USD.  The price rise has been based on hype just like the dotcom bubble.  Sure there are underlying reasons why bitcoin makes sense, but that's not why most people own it.  They own it purely as a trading vehicle.  And that CERTAINLY goes for the alts, which serve no useful purpose whatsoever, besides being inferior bitcoin copycats.

You can call it speculation or whatever you want.  Sure there is tons of that.  But the question is what value do you place on this world-changing tech?  Total crypto is only worth $300B.  That's nothing in the grand scheme of things.  10x-100x is still not out of the question.  The speculation results in sharp up and down moves, but gradually you're seeing the whole space move higher as the network effects start to play out, and there's a firmer, broader base of users.

P.S. We still need to focus on scaling, because at the end of the day, it's a competitive environment in cryptocurrencies, and ease of use along with low fees will build a permanent base of users.  I'm not a big blocker, however we can't lose focus on this.

We went parabolic last year, and parabolas don't last forever, nor do they simply level out.  Just like when bitcoin first hit $1k, it crashed back to $200.  We hit $20k, now we're crashing back to who knows where.  The way to play bitcoin is buy on the crashes down around 70-80%.  Then either HODL or sell when it's parabolic again so you can reload on the next crash.  Unfortunately a lot of people, including myself, thought that "hyperbitcoinization" was going to happen sooner than it actually will.  Maybe in 10 years most stores will accept bitcoin, and younger people will help make bitcoin totally mainstream.  But not anytime soon.  I'm hopeful and bullish, but one must remain realistic.

Windows has gone through various upgrades, just like bitcoin.  There's no need for another coin since bitcoin can evolve.  The community and network effects are very strong and growing.

If centrally-planned and dictated by the powers that be, I would hate a world currency.  If decentralized and organic like bitcoin, it's liberating and game-changing.

They're gatekeepers.  They don't know how to operate or run a business in a world without gates.  Square is currently the front-runner to dominate the future of online/mobile payments.

Agreed, I'm waiting for bitcoin to actually go up while alts flatline or go down before getting optimistic.  It's possible we could spend a year or so in purgatory down about 80% from the top before regaining traction, like 2013-2015.  A lot of psychological damage has been done.
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:30:49
Still waiting for a use case for to emerge in alts.  I like the idea of some decentralized applications, but if they come with platform-specific utility tokens, I lose interest.  
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:57:51
That's the one exception, and I want to see it added to bitcoin.  But right now bitcoin has such a huge advantage over privacy coins like monero in terms of acceptance/developers/community, that it has stronger underlying support in the current meltdown.  There are way more merchants/websites that accept bitcoin than monero currently.
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:45:24
Technically if you spend and replace simultaneously, your net gain/loss is 0.

This is what bitcoin is really about.  Finally we have another option, and it's gaining momentum.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:56:40
That's why I never got the argument that bitcoin will create a run on the banks.  I mean that would be great, but in reality when bitcoin changes hands, the fiat just goes from one bank account to another, still within the banking system.
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:33:43
It's likely doing well because there is an actual use case for private transactions.  What's more surprising is the countless other garbage coins that still have value.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:52:24
In other words, the MtGox folks got screwed.  Claims should be paid in BTC, not in fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:49:34
Rest assured there is far more demand at $200 per coin than there are total coins in existence - let alone willing sellers.

If they're gonna censor everything else, why not censor that garbage too.  Good stuff.
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:57:35
I agree on the discounting over CCs being a big potential driver.  The dollar is strongly entrenched in status quo position.  BTC is a better money, but it'll be awhile before the whole world wises up and demands payment in it.  As for now I think people are happy to pay in fiat, and save in BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:11:46
Agreed, nothing wrong with clamping down on ICO's as securities imo.  An ICO is by definition centralized with devs taking money to work on a business model.  If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck...
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:02:54
It won't be stable until mass adoption occurs (when basically everyone owns some bitcoin).  But since merchants can accept and almost instantly convert to another currency of their choice, volatility shouldn't be a major issue in the meantime.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:42:16
They don't allow shorting through their platform, so at any given moment their customers will be long x number of bitcoins.  How do you think they're going to hedge that exposure without owning the underlying, and why?  
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:13:56
I'm not using it because I want to control my own wallet.  But for novices who don't yet own any bitcoin, it's a chance to put a toe in the water before gaining more knowledge.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:30:01
Square has a great opportunity to make bitcoin easy to use for customers and merchants - essentially become the paypal of bitcoin.  I think Jack recognizes the value in the decentralization and security that bitcoin offers.  Businesses focused entirely around bitcoin will have a huge leg up in 5-10 years imo.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:59:50
Relax.  Point was simply that there isn't a ban, it's just much harder than it used to be.  If people want to buy that garbage I couldn't care less personally, but the SEC isn't going to let scammers crawl out from the woodwork and steal people's money hand over fist.  They're assuming most ICO investors like you are retarded.  They may have a point.

A discount for bitcoin purchases will be needed to grow usage substantially.

So you're saying the market isn't saturated...
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:50:50
Yeah the biggest mountain bitcoin has to climb is displacing the status quo.  I believe it will gradually infect like a virus.  First merchants will offer discounts with BTC.  Then consumers will feel more comfortable buying/holding/using BTC.  Volatility will eventually drop as virtually everyone in the world has some exposure to it.  Eventually, things can be priced directly in BTC, including wages.  We just need patience.
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:07:54
Disgusting.  Almost makes you want to get out of the space entirely TBH.

Correct, it's a second layer software basically that anyone can run if they choose to.  Segwit provided a fix that allows the lightning network to work.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:22:09
That's the thing, people won't pay in bitcoin unless either A) they have to (merchant requires it) OR B) merchant offers discount.  My guess is B might come into play due to credit card fees merchants have to pay.  But we'll see.

Yeah TPTB control fiat through the banking system, and they're gonna leverage that control until people transact regularly in bitcoin.  That's why we need to continue building this separate parallel financial system.  Right now you still need fiat for 99.9% of all transactions, unfortunately.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:15:14
That's why there is ongoing activity with the lightning network.  Bitcoin is scaling, just have a little patience.  For now, enjoy the low fees brought to you by segwit and batched txs.  Later, we'll use LN.

Keep in mind that the traditional rules of finance may not apply to bitcoin.  It's an entirely new asset class.  And institutions have not even gotten involved in it yet.  It's certainly a gamble but a good one in my view.  For me, it would be more painful to watch bitcoin fail than to lose my investment.  If you're of that mindset, you're in good shape.  If you're in it for a quick buck, you could get badly burned, no doubt.

Good write-up but coinbase doesn't care.  They're about making money, but also their CEO is pro-ethereum and anti-bitcoin.  The hasty roll-out of Bcash was done with malicious intent.  It's obvious to anyone with half a brain.  Why isn't bitcoin gold listed?  How bout ethereum classic?  Good news is bitcoin has shrugged off everything that's ever been thrown at it.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:24:30

@_date: 2018-02-05 22:17:37
Hopefully by the next boom we'll have better infrastructure built up to make it easier to transact for virtually nothing.  I envision merchants offering a bitcoin payment option with a discount due to no CC fees. 
 It'll come in due time.

Bitcoin has a strong community of users/investors that really believe in the core principles of sound money.  Altcoin investors just buy if prices are going up.  There's no use case to date for a single altcoin other than speculation.

It'll be great once a big retailer like Amazon or Walmart accepts bitcoin.  Then there's a big reason for people to buy besides just getting rich quick.  It would have to be at a discount to CC though to really drive people in mass.

This is why I'm more optimistic about ETFs, if they're ever approved.  Actual investors with cash equity can enter the market.  I would recommend controlling your own private keys, but a lot of folks are too lazy for that, yet they have money to invest.

Based on the price action I've seen in an infinite amount of shitcoins, yes they are, but that's not the point.  The point isn't to stop ICOs, but make them more transparent and hold the devs accountable (prevent fraud).
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:17:05
He's right that bitcoin will eventually be better than fiat in every way.  Here's the problem - people are stupid, resistant to change, and rarely agree on anything.  Our whole economy is built around USD and it certainly won't change on a dime.  While bitcoin is the best digital currency in terms of decentralization and security, there are innumerable alternatives and knock-offs.  
I do think bitcoin will maintain its lead in crypto due to its network effect advantage, but will the world be run on bitcoin in 5 years?  Unfortunately No.

It's one step forward, however the BIG news will be when an ETF is approved.  That's something everyday average investors could buy into, essentially opening the floodgates to investors who are interested in bitcoin, but don't (yet) want to get into the murky details of buying bitcoin outright and securing private keys.

hopefully it's down to 1 coin by then, or..... less?
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:56:03
I've still seen this at some gas stations.  Visa and MC should not be able to prohibit alternative payment method discounts, totally anti-competitive given the near monopoly they have.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:43:47
No, but any one person could pry a little more from his friend for the right price.  That of course assumes the friend is interested in the type of payment being offered.  If it's fiat, maybe not...

@_date: 2018-02-21 20:45:03
So if gold goes up to 1400, but bitcoin drops 10%, you actually lose bitcoin.  Ouch.  On the other side though you could be short gold, have it go against you, cover at 1400 and convert to more bitcoin.  Fun stuff.

But his businesses accept dollars, so apparently he's fine with those pieces of paper having value... you know, cuz they're from the gubmint.
I guess the advantage of investing in businesses, and not currencies, is that they'll operate regardless of what the currency is - dollars, bitcoin, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:29:02
I'm not even sure why we pay taxes anyways.  We have a massive government debt and nobody seems to care.  Of course one would assume eventually the dollar would crater and lose more of its value.  
I'm hopefully that BTC will accelerate the demise of big governments around the world, as the money supply will no longer be in their control.  The potential is mind-boggling.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:21:41
They need to make sure the rich stay rich and the little guy stays in his place.  They'll make exchanges be fully compliant and regulated and certain offerings will only be available to the rich prior to trading on a regulated platform, like it is now with IPOs.

@_date: 2017-09-06 15:29:27
Think of bitcoin this way - it has several use cases:  p2p transfer (cheap global remittances as opposed to western union, etc.), online purchases (albeit at a limited number of establishments), and store of value (like gold).  The latter probably provides the most value.  Those on this board generally believe bitcoin will be the premier internet protocol for transfer and store of value, largely due to the network effect (constantly growing and evolving, name brand recognition, etc.).

If it's public info to disclose all their holdings (which I'm not sure it is), you're free to dig in and prove me wrong.  However they just started crypto a week ago so I doubt you'll find anything.  I don't even get the point of your argument.  I hold my own bitcoin personally, that's the point of bitcoin.  All I'm saying is Robinhood is probably legitimate and probably holds the bitcoin that clients purchase.  Do I know for sure?  No.  But I have no plans to use their services, so I have no skin in the game.  Hence I don't really care.

Valid point.  Bitcoiners believe this is not a traditional asset however.  It is a global commodity/currency hybrid with potential to take over the world.  What percentage of the world population owns any bitcoin?  1%?  Just nudging that number up slightly can have an exponential impact on price.  Get an Amazon or Walmart accepting bitcoin with a slight discount to fiat (due to no CC fees), and look out.

What are you talking about?  They can earn money on commissions, etc. without gambling on the BTC price - just own it on behalf of customers like a stockbroker.  Have the last word bud, I'm not gonna argue w you all day.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:29:32
Correct, there is a lot more dollar-denominated wealth in the world than actual dollars.  My belief is bitcoin can be a multi-trillion dollar asset, of course that's a big range still and highly speculative.

 - LN will be instant and virtually free
 - widespread adoption will lower volatility over time.

The fees are low on BCC only because nobody uses it.

It's quite useful for a lot of things - international and online payments, some degree of privacy (which will improve), etc.  What you're seeing though is there's also a high amount of speculative value that has been built in.  But whether bitcoin is $1K or $1MM, people can still transact and move money in a liquid market (the most liquid of all cryptos by far).  This is just one benefit of the network effects bitcoin has.
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:59:32
"Need" to be written to the main chain?  Not necessarily true.  Regardless, blockchains do not scale without second layer solutions.  If the whole world migrated to Monero, what do you think transaction costs and speed would look like?  
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:56:58
Eventually when bitcoin is mainstream, the price will stabilize at a much higher level.  It'll still go up, but not like we see nowadays.  Say hello to the equity based monetary system.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:24:34
What's the issue?  I'm hopeful that second layer solutions will add privacy if that's what you're getting at.  This is key along with cheap/instant transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:22:45
Just because your currency is gradually appreciating in value doesn't mean you won't spend it.  You'll just be more careful what you spend it on.  Bitcoin supply is still increasing, just at a decreasing rate as time goes on.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:20:06
In a given hour we could be + or - 1k, so who the hell knows.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:42:27
The good thing is bitcoin is still the most liquid, most decentralized, most secure cryptocurrency with the largest community behind it and best developers.  Let's hope LN and other solutions continue to build on the strength and network effects of BTC.

Bitcoin is still 63% off the highs so it's not like it's running away from anyone.

Why would anyone want fiat when they can have bitcoin instead?  De-centralized, limited, and censorship resistant.  The guy has a hard-on for the status quo because that's what his business is based on.  He's an old rich white guy, not a visionary.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:31:26
I know there are services than can convert to USD or whatever right at the time of purchase, but usually there's a slight lag so I'm not sure how that works and whether it causes capital gains/losses.  Also not sure how it would work with LN because if they accept a LN payment, can that also be converted to USD instantly?  I don't know of any LN exchanges, yet.
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:54:43
If the stuff you bought was priced in BTC, you wouldn't check it much.  Hopefully we'll live to see that day.
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:33:01
What are they so afraid of?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:23:21
Agreed, it is definitely possible, just not probable in a short time frame.  A decent percentage of coins are lost too, so the actual supply is lower than it appears.  Maybe in 10 years every store will have an option to pay in BTC...we can dream.
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:22:01
Sales proceeds DO NOT equal profit.  If you acquired $20k of BTC at the same price you sold at, your net gain/loss is $0.  Only if you acquired for free and sold for $20k would you have to pay tax on $20k of gains.
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:31:54
It still wouldn't defeat bitcoin, but at least it would fail in a more noble manner.

@_date: 2018-04-03 19:09:59
Banks are irrelevant.  There are already services that merchants can use to convert BTC to fiat and vice versa, it's just that the bitcoin blockchain has transaction limitations.  With LN that will no longer be an issue.
Ability to spend easily is not what gives bitcoin value though.  Apple Pay uses fiat, same as a credit card.  Bitcoin's value lies in its limited nature and immutable ledger.  It is far scarcer than dollars, and will be increasingly scarcer over time.  Add in decentralization and it's clear why it has huge advantages over government controlled fiat currencies.  Most people don't have half a brain however, so they'll be using fiat until they get hit in the head with a brick... in the form of discounted online purchases via bitcoin.  This will spur bitcoin usage among the intellectually challenged population.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:49:52
Eff these guys.
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:19:04
Sounds like you need to do a little more homework.  Bitcoin is not a stock, it's a decentralized currency which nobody controls, and it's limited in supply unlike the inflationary dollars in your wallet.  It's becoming easier to use every day.  Lightning apps will be needed for merchants to easily and instantly accept bitcoin and then convert to USD.  But that's all in the works.  Merchants can then accept bitcoin at a discount to fiat because they won't have to pay CC fees, which will help accelerate usage.
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:22:16
Every time we pass the prior highs, it leads more people to say "wow, this bitcoin thing hasn't gone away yet?"  Right now, everyone thinks it was a bubble and that we'll never revisit those levels.

Problem with that is steady state has not been reached on btc.  The vast majority of people in this world do not own it, and a good portion have not even heard of it.  Eventually it'll get there, but perhaps at a much higher price and with many more users (assuming it succeeds in achieving mass adoption).
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:41:38
They have to hold bitcoin if they don't want to risk losing money.  That's the point.  If they want to be a hedge fund and try to time it, sure.  There aren't crypto-specific regulations on that.  But given that they're in the brokerage business, one can assume that's unlikely.
Your bank analogy is apples and oranges.  The correct analogy is saying the bank takes your money and gambles it in the stock market, which they don't.  Now, they could lose money on loans, which is a whole nother issue.

Uh, last I checked BTC handles way more transactions.  Like, WAY more.  And that's with a 1 MB limit compared to 8 MB.

Bitcoin is a highly emotional topic for people.  For those without skin in the game, they're jealous and upset over missing out when it goes up, or happy when it goes down.  For those with skin in the game, it's just the opposite - excitement in bull runs, despair in bear markets.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:26:54
There's already a sizable and growing population that uses bitcoin, and it'll grow further as older folks die off and younger ones adopt it more readily.  Even if it never gains global adoption as unit of account, which I agree is a long ways off, it can still grow rapidly as the currency of the internet.  It's the easiest, most liquid way to transfer money anywhere in the world without a 3rd party.  We'll extend our tentacles further over time.

Set aside all the technological reasons why BTC is superior, the world would never switch over to Bcash for the simple fact that people hate Roger and Jihan.  Most people don't like dictators.

Maybe that's why they hiked fees, to try to drive away customers since they couldn't handle the volume anyways.  This is not a good look for them reputation-wise.

You see this in the stock market from retail investors also.  They think a $10 stock is cheap and a $1000 stock is expensive.  Well if the $10 stock has 1 billion shares outstanding, but the $1000 stock has only 10 million shares outstanding, the equity market cap is identical ($10 billion for both).  
People investing in cryptocurrencies need to look at the market cap, not the price per coin.  Bitcoin has a very limited coin supply (relative to most other cryptos), and by far the largest network, hence a higher price per coin.
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:45:30
For the legit exchanges, there's really no way around regulation.  These companies are interacting with the BTC network but also the traditional banking system for conversion in and out of USD.  That said, you can always trade BTC locally or maybe on unregulated exchanges if you want to get around it.  I don't see it as an either or proposition.  Take your pick on how you want to trade BTC.  I think most people want to use regulated exchanges for the safety and convenience.
