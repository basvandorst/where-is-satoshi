fwiw - liqpay (another btc-e funding mechanism) also allows use of visa/mastercard and afaik it does work with US credit cards. I've been using it for years now (but with a UK issued credit card).

right; except that you *can* export the private key to your bitcointip wallet - not sure why you'd want to do this, but I guess it might be good to have if the bitcointip bot goes down and you suddenly realize you need to access the btc you had there.

did you verify your address with them sending you a letter?

Lots of people have told me it doesn't work in the UK either, so I don't really know whether or not to believe you. There isn't anything saying it doesn't work from the US.. it's not the easiest thing to setup either and most people fail due to issues with SMS messages not arriving (so they can't log in) -that can be fixed by the chat support, or not being able to verify their CC because the charge that liqpay sends is only an auth message (not an actual billing event) so it never shows on your statement. You have to somehow get your CC company to tell you how much they auth'd and then fill that in on their verification form.. also your bank will most likely randomly decline any payments you do make so it will probably take two or three tries before you actually succeed. I think those things combined with the fact that some steps aren't translated from Russian pretty much stops people from using it when technically it may still be possible.

there's an option once you log in to verify your address and then they mail you a letter with a code to type in to verify that you received it.. also you probably need to verify your card by getting them to charge a small amount to it and then telling them how much they charged.. they have live chat support that's somewhat helpful.
