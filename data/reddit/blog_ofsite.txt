I've been waiting for 2 months now...does it take this long?
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:31:34
$1220 right now

All exchanges are being flooded nobody is able to sell. Also people in China haven't sold and others are asleep. I predict $900 today or less.

Most accurate thing I have seen especially their "suspicious activity" / fraud prevention that is **flaws** to the extreme. If you buy in dips and spend the majority of your funds, then expect it to cancel due to "suspicious activity".   Their fraud prevention will not see it as you buying in a dip, but instead as using most of your funds and that by itself is suspicious to their fraud prevention software. Extremely flawed no wonder one of their top officials resigned.

I heard ETF likes to announce stuff usually before the market closes? So I am guessing there is a high % that ETF will announce something on Friday?

And Coinbase has user interface? Coinbase allows you to trade without fees? Do you even understand what you are typing?

guess people who bought BTC at $5 and became millionaires aren't real too

If this holds for a week, then mark me as surprised.

I've used both and Coinbase made me lost $3000 while canceling my order on a dip when I have been a customer since the beginning. Took 9 days for their support to answer. So yes, I used both.

only reason it rose is because 80% of the exchanges crashed. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:45:48
when is that? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:24:09
I heard someone shouted "approved" in SEC parking lot and price suddenly goes up by 10%
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:59:42
if custodians withdraw, then that's a rejection basically? IF no announcement is made by 11th, then automatic acceptance or would that be 13th for automatic acceptance? ? 
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:44:42
Not really the case. They can still withdraw on Friday or even extend or whatever other options they get. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:22:37
Most new published articles state that a decision is coming this Friday. Very interesting...

I made a secret language to encrypt my 24 words for recovering ledger and made a secret code to un-encrypt my secret language. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:19:34
you mean less than a day? It's $7400 right now.

I can confirm, I bought some through Coinbase and as my purchases got larger I got a call from them basically threatening me they will close my account if I buy Bitcoin. The guy who called me was from their fraud department and associated bitcoin with drug dealers and illegal purchases. Worst bank in my life and highly do not recommend it.

It's insane. When I wired money out of Gemini it was in my account in less than 2 hours.

We might take down reddit with the 9000 meme; no joke. I've been waiting years.

I have 0.1 (bought when it was worth $200) and still had a nano s.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:08:10
can't merchants check fee paid? for BTC to get unconfirmed it would have to be a very low fee, so if merchants check tx and fee paid is "good", then they should be relatively safe.
@_date: 2018-07-02 06:15:20
Just found this thread and BTC hit $5800 range. Hope you bought some back. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:24:04
He should sell and party with $100k....$100k profit in less than a week. I would sell.
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:24:17
He made $100k profit so far.
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:23:29
OP made $50k in less than a week now.
