Um, software that you have to "be gentle" to us shitty software. Do companies that make money advertising on Facebook, for example, "be gentle to Facebook" by trying not to use it too much? Absurd, right?

That is fascinating, and could make a huge difference in the impact of this ruling. If you can use LIFO and always rebuy prior to spending, you can basically completely avoid the ridiculous capital gains burden for the "buy coffee" case. We just need an app that can automatically pre-rebuy for you when you spend.

I have wondered about this... this is just my guess: is the advantage that by being in a pool you can make sure everyone is trying different nonces, so that there's no duplicated work within a pool?

Interesting, but I think it's weird that you wrote it as if you were already in the future, remembering back to now, and trying to pretend. Wouldn't it be more interesting for future you to read a description of exactly what it felt like at the time? Rather than for future you to read what you thought future you would be remembering?

This is interesting. It's hard to fathom an entire global network of bickering hackers to all suddenly, simultaneously, as a group, decide "let's all switch to the losing block chain" and then execute that.
But I guess I can see his point that "you spent all that money and all you got was a single double-spend. good job."

That's fair.... although they'd have to physically find me first just based on my reddit user name and post history. Speaking of which, I should probably go and delete old posts because I'm sure there's some identifying details in there. Once I saw someone who had a bot set up that would go and auto-delete their posts after a week, which seemed smart since no one reads week-old reddit posts anyway and it keeps you private.

One you spend on stuff and trade with people for goods and services. The other you just hold onto because others want it so it holds its value. Like a house or something. But others have to actually want it. This whole "store of value" will continue to work as long as you can keep convincing people that they want bitcoins. But previously, when they went from $1 to $1000 in value, it was because they could be used as a currency. We used to have tip bots and you could tip each other 50 cents for a 1 cent fee. Now you can't do anything with your bitcoins except hold onto them and cult-ishly try to convince more people to do it. We used to convince people to buy bitcoins by telling them it would be a better currency. Now we just tell them they should buy because of you join the cult you will get rich. It's like a multi-level marketing scheme now.

which vision? the "futuristic vision that was created back in 2009" as OP puts it? Cuz back in 2009 it was a "peer to peer electronic cash system." Now all of a sudden everyone here is saying "it's not a currency, it's a store of value" but I thought the value was only ever there because it was a currency. I don't get it.

That's not how any of this works... More people using Bitcoin will make this problem worse... That's the whole problem in the first place...

It means the whole point of Bitcoin was to supplant banks. Do you remember what was happening in '09? The banks had almost destroyed the world economy with their shenanigans, and then stuck the taxpayers with the bill. Bitcoin was created so that you could "be your own bank". The Genesis block, the first block of the block chain, has that message embedded in it as a reminder.
Edit: this is also why some people think that Bitcoin developers being employed by a banking company is a conflict of interest.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:13:28
(a) you know what I mean. and (b) that's still better than like 1000% transfer fee. How much would it cost to get a 50 cent transaction in the next block right now?
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:28:18
Yes, that's true, every miner can set that option differently. And every miner has a different mempool. "The mempool" is kind of a misnomer.

Nobody knows what will happen. But the most important number to watch is the number in parentheses after the "**BTC  1.00x** (number right here!)" at this link: 
That's the profitability metric after the upcoming difficulty adjustment. Currently miners/hash power is moving to BCH mining because profitability is higher. 
The thing everyone is betting on right now (whether they realize it or not) is whether that number will stay above 1. 
If it does, miners will switch back to BTC mining after the difficulty adjustment, and things will continue as normal, or maybe BTC will rebound and the whole scare that's happening right now will have been thwarted.
If it doesn't, miners will stay on the BCH chain and bitcoin will probably go into a death spiral.
The thing is, the number is falling dramatically right now because (a) BTC price is falling rapidly and (b) BCH price is rising rapidly. The number was above 2 a couple of hours ago. As I type this it's at 1.88.
I basically can't sleep because I want to know whether that number is going to hit 1 or not before the difficulty adjustment happens, which somewhat coincidentally is going to happen in about 20 hours. 
Whatever happens, this is truly a historic moment! Get your popcorn as they say!

False. For example: Ethereum has a better smart contract system. Monero has true privacy and anonymity (unlike Bitcoin) via the cryptonote protocol. Both of them regularly hard-fork to add functionality. Bitcoin was first and has brand recognition, you're right about that. But so did Myspace.

 1. Doomsday preppers fork BCH just in case the liars keep lying, this time saying they will upgrade to 2mb blocks if SegWit is accepted as a compromise but reneging on the deal after it is made. 
 2. Even-minded folks assume good will and advocate for a reasonable compromise. Core faithful get their full wish, SegWit integration, big blockers get the meager 2mb I stead of the 8 they wanted. That's ok let's stick together.
 3. Core supporters support 2x and make it seem as if they will accept it over reneging.
 4. 2x obviously doesn't happen because the doomsday preppers were right. The agreement was reneged upon. Even minded folks (like me) realise the whole thing was a farce, they only pretended to agree to get their way, and don't care about reneging because they have absolute power over the Bitcoin Core code (ahem centralization cough)
 5. Smart people realize BTC has been compromised and BCH is the actual decentralized fork and move over.

I think this is why a lot of people were against SegWit. It was a big change.
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:19:03
That's not really true. Without RBF, you'd have to convince miners to conspire with you to mine the second transaction instead of the first. This would be to their disadvantage because they'd be working on different transactions than the rest of the network which would mean a risk of creating an orphaned block. Also even then you'd only have some percentage chance of making it work, not a guarantee. Basically for small transactions (the kind you'd want to be instant, like buying a pack of gum) it's just not worth the trouble to try and double spend. 
There were a couple of good talks about the details of this at the Satoshi's Vision conference, which of course no one at this sub watched because it was ridiculed and groupthink made everyone here believe it was a bunch of idiots or something, when actually it was some of the smartest people in the space IMHO. There are some other great ideas that were presented, like one about "subchains" that increase the security of 0-conf transactions even more, none of which are possible on Bitcoin BTC because of RBF. Here's one of them: 
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:37:28


Lol, they didn't just "tend to", they were forced to because any dissenting opinion was censored. Doesn't anyone remember the famous "consensus is a high bar, and we can't allow discussion of anything that doesn't already have consensus" post?
Edit: 
The crazy part is the he's simultaneously saying "there is consensus that big blocks are bad therefore that's wrong and we aren't allowed to discuss it" and also "just because you might have a majority agreeing with you that doesn't mean you're right, if 90% of the users of this sub disagree then I will ban 90% of the users" that's the real reason r/BTC is named what it is. It started because it was the only subreddit about Bitcoin where dissenting opinions were allowed.
@_date: 2018-04-29 22:43:44


Yeah that's exactly what I said. It irreversibly changed the protocol without a fork, by changing the code of the reference client. That is why I said that the core developers have absolute co trol over the protocol. They can make changes without allowing miners the opportunity to follow the other fork, because they cleverly write their code in such a way that there is no other fork to follow, and then they market that with the term "soft fork" which sounds nicer even though it's more Machiavellian, and use the marketing term "hard fork" as a villian because it sounds dangerous. And gullivle people fall for this and believe that so called soft forks are somehow better when really they are subverting the process of the nakamoto consensus.


I mean yeah it's down from the all time high but... Bitcoin is down from its all time high vs $ too. ATH isn't the bar. The general trend is upwards and BCH is enabling new use cases, like memo.cash, Cointext, and being able to use it for small payments. Recently the price vs Bitcoin is rising, but that's not the metric most BCHers care about. They care about usage which I admit is low but I believe it's also rising.
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:10:44
So like, there was obvious "contention" over integrating SegWit. They put it in the reference client (the only one that matters) anyway, as a so-called "soft fork". Once the first block was mined with a SegWit transaction in it the blockchain was permanently changed to be a SegWit-compatible blockchain. It's not the same thing any more.
I think it's disingenuous, or maybe just ignorant, to say that one fork was contentious but the other wasn't. One was clandestine and one was overt, is more how I would put it. The BCH fork had to happen when it did because the SegWit change was about to be "soft-forked" into the blockchain with no alternative, it was a forced fork with no alternate fork. Miners could vote beforehand and they did, but after SegWit happened there *was* no alternate chain for miners to actually vote with their computing power. Except there was, it was called BCH.
So really these are the two forks of that *contentious* SegWit fork. IMO it is yet to be seen which fork won. BTC is and has been winning but the gap is closing.
@_date: 2016-05-30 17:16:15
me too.
@_date: 2018-04-29 22:54:02
Which is why BCH says that replace by fee was a bad idea. It ruined the security of these so called 0-conf transactions, whereas without RBF you can have good confidence within seconds that the transaction cannot be double spent, based on the fact that it has propagated to the rest of the network.
