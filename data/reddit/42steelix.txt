OMG this is not an internet argument over whether it is banned or not. Decentralization is the core of bitcoin. It CAN NOT be regulated by govenment. Therefore can not be banned. The FM knows this. The leading news outlets. And I mean LEADING=MAINSTREAM news websites are spreading fear using clickbaity headlines. A huge population will be influenced to fear sell. I am not telling you to do anything about it or panic. You have misunderstood the purpose of the post. I just want the community to be in the know. Be aware. SMH.

What to say. They are one of the most trusted media outlets of the country. Not some shady tabloid dishing speculative news. Also other large news outlets are spreading this news with clickbaity headlines. The people get easily influenced and may sell due to panic. I mean can we get the mods to post a warning or something.

Exactly why I posted this. The people there don't know. They are just selling out of fear. Check the rates have dropped in the local exchanges.
This could be a buy opportunity for many. Provided the person knows what he is dealing with.

Not so. Check for yourself boxhit. Just let the wave settle for a few days before impulse buying/fear selling.

No man, the huge populations can have a great effect on the prices due to fear selling. I just posted this so that community gets to know.
Expect fluctuations in the coming days.
Edit: The country's budget for the next Financial Year was declared today.
