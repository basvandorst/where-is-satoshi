I think it was heat related, it was getting to 72c then the driver would crash and drop down then raise and drop again. I cleaned out the heatsink and now it doesn't work so I think something broke from the heat.

It was sitting in Slush's pool payout, I have the normal bitcoin wallet on my desktop at home that I put the payout code to. I was trying to move it to CaVirtex later but I don't think I confirmed that change. Haven't looks at the stuff in a long time so have to double check it all.
EDIT: Its Bitcoin-Qt from bitcoin.org that I have.

I have UPnP ticked and forwarded the port. I added in a line in the config for 50 connections, but still stuck on 8 people last I checked. Maybe when I get home in a couple hours I'll be surprised.

So what will be the impact of this, being that transaction fees are what gives priority to processing of transactions.

.97 coins burned my 5770 out. I'm waiting for that to raise so I can sell the coin for a new card. Never mining again now.

How do you configure it to work better? I just upgraded to 0.8.1. There a guide anywhere?

I allowed it through Windows Firewall. Do I have to explicitly open the port for it to work?

Slush's pool. It was one of those I'll cash out when it hits 1BTC, didn't realize how long it would take to mine, or the stress on my GPU at the time. Noticed prices were up and decided it would be wise to check on it. It's been there since 2012 didn't think anything would happen to it.

But if they stop using ISK, I can't use my EVE Wallet balance to pick up women :(. Given its a country of 300,000ish people, it would be an interesting large scale test case to see how it would work in practice.
