Napster was the inspiration for bitcoin imo. Napster got too popular before p2p was perfected. It never was supposed to have centralized servers, that was a temporary hack.
There were too many greedy people involved in Napster that doomed it, from every side. Maybe this is the fate of bitcoin and something superior will surface in the future. For now, it is not going anywhere.
Napster started a whole heap of excitement. Kazaa, then bitorrent, then Skype, then cryptocurrencies. Napster showed what could be done, and without it there wouldn't have been iPods, and Apple would not have had the run it did. The excitement of Napster made things like the Diamond Rio exist. 
Change is coming in a big way with bitcoin. The way we transact has changed. PayPal can now die in a grease fire, they stand to lose the most if they don't embrace it.

Funny you mention Napster. Shawn Fanning might actually be one of the people behind bitcoin. It was his vision to decentralize everything. Napster was a beta that exploded, the idea was never to have centralized servers. Napster sidetracked him from true greatness imo, but he is doing ok now.
Bram Cohen was just a more efficient programmer. Fanning would have made bittorrent himself if he had the opportunity though, so your premise is flawed. There were a lot of people who had similar ideas at the time. I'm not sure many were at the creative level of Fanning though.
Nobody seriously thought MySpace or AOL would be around in ten years, and it died without some catalyst of change. Programmers naturally want to improve things, and it doesn't always have anything to do with politics or being forced to.
We are still reliant on domain names, and hostage to the idea that .com has some sort of premium. This will end someday too, much like nobody uses ICQ numbers anymore.
