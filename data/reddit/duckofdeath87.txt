Can you link me to a run down of what makes it different?

Well, in order for it to work you do need to end up with a price point within a certain range of the true price. 
Edit: basically in your scenario, you were wrong about the price and you needed to update your expectations. Reassessing your model regularly is a good idea. You make a good point.

The secret reason we HODL is so we can have a life outside of Bitcoin. HODL is easy. Just buy it, secure it, and let it be until you can buy a house or something with it.

All we know if that is people buy more, prices will rise. If they sell more prices will fall.
If there is money to be made people will fix technology issues. They always do. 
We never know anything until we can't act on it anyone.

Dude. Look at tonight and tell me it can't happen. You and I are a part of some of the craziest shit our generation has ever seen.

The smartest man I know told me you should pick a price you think is right and but when it's below and ask when it's above and ignore everything else (unless something EXTERNAL happens to change your target price). He then proved, mathematically, that was consistently the best strategy. 
Selling because of sudden change in price is a bad idea in any kind of investment. Stand strong and HODL until you hit your Moon. Mine is 50k for a third of my stash then 1 million for another third. I expect the last third won't need converting to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:42:13
I know right? I mean, I looked at Bitcoin and it was 12000 and then everyone freaked out about how much it dropped and it was over 15000. Wtf?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:24:51
In my experience, the stress of trying to win every dip and peak is not worth the money. Picking your Moon price and holding until then has the nice effect that you don't have to stress out, assuming you didn't mortgage your house to buy them or something.

I really wish I could remember the details, but it was some pretty deep statistics stuff. (he is a data scientist I work with. PHD in stats that is a huge trading nerd.) 
It was something about how price discovery meets with the natural variance in price. If you select a price that is within the variance interval of the actual price (which no one can ever know) you will still make money buying below that number and selling above it. It turns out that it's more important to stick to a price point than to try to catch dips and sell peaks. (Because your don't know they are peaks and dips when you can buy them, but you do know if they are above or below your selected price) you make money on average as long as you aren't too far off. 
You won't be perfect, but that's ok. The point is to focus on making money on average. 
But one aspect of it is that you need to understand there are people trading this stuff that have more money, are on the inside of things, and are, frankly, smarter than you. 
If there is money to be made dumping and pumping (or whatever else you can come up with beyond long and short) those other people will always beat you to it. (Unless you are working at a big bank and you overheard a plot to pump and dump Bitcoin, then by all means, act accordingly.)

I honestly believe that Bitcoin is the future for the Middle East and India. They really need something stable in thier economy that can survive the government BS that goes on. I hear the gold trade is strongly regulated in India. Maybe Bitcoin will prove easier to "smuggle".
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:35:22
Go you man! You probably want to put most of that into a more stable investment :)

I tired to buy a trezor, but my credit card kept refusing to work with thier sure. So I have a ledger.

Still got mine! Yubikeys are great. I got a new one for my exchange account access. I feel better about it than the app based authenticators.

Turning government cheese into my solar powered crypto money? Where do I sign?
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:52:29
Anecdotely, I have friends from India and they would smuggle gold into their country because they didn't trust their currency. They apparently can only buy a small amount of gold per year there, so smuggling was the only way to get and really amount.
I think this stuff happens pretty often. I know I am more aware of monetary issues now that I follow Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:22:53
You can almost turn 10 BCH into 1 BTC right now. I'm considering it.

Not to mention a hedge against government stability in general. Look at the prices in Zimbabwe. Think about how the people there can buy Bitcoin to mitigate some of the damage their government situation is causing them. Now think about if more Nations leave the EU and the impact of the Euro. (I don't see gold as being all that great for this. It's too hard to move around and too easy to regulate)
I should add, I'm not an archaist and I don't see Bitcoin as a threat to stabile governments. Bitcoin is just a stabilizing factor (once we finally settle on a price).
@_date: 2019-02-20 05:49:57
Isn't it way cheaper than credit cards or debit cards?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:29:25
The best time to buy was a few years back. Second best time is now! Just don't invest anything you can't lose.
That said, I think you did pretty good. It's a wild ride. No one has figured out the right price. Everyone here thinks we are heading to the Moon. Don't be shocked if it hits 4k or 10k by the end of the year. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:25:06
I like to imagine a day where everyone will see Bitcoin as stable and fiat ad unstable. That day isn't today.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:46:50
Time to buy BTC :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:08:04
This does feel like a ploy to convert BCH into BTC at a better rate and then fork. It's free money on free money.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:41:39
I think you should try to add some context about why this stuff is important. 
I would add, plan to hodl for at least 5 years. We don't know when this thing will take over, but it's not before 2020. This is more of a why we do/say the above, but I think the context is important. 
This is about decentralization. Think for your self. Spread power out. If you don't know what's right, think about what will make the strongest system and what keeps power in the most hands. That way is probably going to work out in the long run. We need this to be ingrained in the culture. 
@_date: 2019-12-26 17:40:58
Reddit has mods and admins on top of voting. They do a lot. If you could have a very open way of decentralized moderated media sharing...

There was already a lot going on in that episode. I think they did it this way to keep it brief. It really felt like it should have been 3 episodes.

There are scaling issues and every system will have scaling issues, but a lot of progress has been made and more progress will be made (if not, then Bitcoin will fail)

I think they are trying to say that after the Bitcoin revolution, bank fees will be replaced by Bitcoin transaction fee, which are much less.
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:05:30
Are you moving it between banks? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:03:16
In Europe, sure. Bitcoin might never beat the euro because they have the good sense to control the banks.
But third world countries and America? Bitcoin can take over. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:48:05
Bitcoin is cash. You can't rollback cash without consensus of both parties. 
If you want to keep your consumer protections, buy things on a credit card and pay your credit card with Bitcoin.

Don't discount being the first viable one. It's dominance shows that it's durable enough to withstand China and the technology is good enough that these better chains aren't better enough to matter.

O yeah, absolutely. If you are an independent contractor/creative, Bitcoin is amazing and you should 100% manage your own walletm
Think about it if you had a hundred artists working for you with 20 sales people and 10 accountants. Would you manage all the keys yourself or would you hire people to do that for you? How would you trust anyone to do it?
@_date: 2019-09-05 07:46:29
I am happy with Bitcoin ticker widget. You can type in the amount you have and it tells you what they are worth. I also have Sentinel, which has my read only key.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:55:13
I think the issue with that approach is theft/losing keys. How do you manage wallets at an Enterprise scale?
@_date: 2019-09-19 18:25:51
It depends on what "wildly accepted" looks like. 
Maybe it simply is like gold? The world has 7 trillion USD in gold. If btc replaced gold, we are looking at about 333k USD per btc. 
Interestingly, there is only 1.7 trillion USD in circulation. If it only replaced USD, we are looking at 80k USD per BTC.
I think this article is pretty decent at comparing what you are wanting to compare.
 
Also, these are painfully naive estimates, but BTC is a whole new idea. I don't think anyone knows what it's capable of. (If it's not obvious, I'm dividing the total value of the other stuff by 21 million)
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:02:51
More hashpower means it costs more to do a 50% attack. If a coin had a low amount of power behind it and a high market cap, it will be worth taking over. Some one will suddenly spin up a lot of nodes and make a lot of money at the coast of everyone else and no one can stop them. 
Because of this, the cost of a 50% attack should put a hard cap on the market cap off any crypto currency.

@_date: 2018-04-27 21:22:39
I read his comment as saying "market value matters and hash rate doesn't" and I am trying to say "hash rate limits market value".
I just wanted to say that even though market value is a big deal, hash rates matter a lot.

There are something like 144 blocks per day? So that's is less than a million transactions per block. Still a lot.
