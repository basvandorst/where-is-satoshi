You could perform the 'calculation' without first creating letters or having any form of communication.

I would start a third party payroll service for companies on an good ledger. Could reduce costs in a number of areas. For a company like a temp agency that employs homeless individuals it could help a lot. The infrastructure isn't there yet though or people aren't working on it or something, but it should happen.

Bought more last night but bank transaction might not go though. Would be the second time that has happened with Wells Fargo. Couldn't even withdraw money or anything the last two days. At least Bitcoin went up and LTC so when I have to sell it back I'll get to keep some for free.

This is massive. Biblical. It's bigger than banks. Even the super power governments shake in fear. There's a real war going on.

Just need an easy to access an inexpensive Bitcoin debt card that use existing POS systems that nearly all retails have. Or, a hard crypto wallet cell phone with a virtual card but those will be expensive. If I could go to Walmart a good loadable card I'd tradition to spending BTC on the daily. Will just do bank transfers to buy back what I spent.

If I had billions I'd have at least a few million in a privacy coin just for a single vacation.

I didn't check the prices until I went down to my bank to find their system was down and unable to withdraw or spend my money... Was kind of happy about well Fargo issues.

Banks collapse. Companies, institutions, and individuals go bankrupt. Governments fall. When will this events happen on each of the different timelines of every different thing?
Fait becoming worthless because of it going into the Bitcoin economy happens over time on a non linear manner.

I don't understand why they would sell. Pretty much lost money. Why sell now close to it's new 5+ year low when they have already had it so long. Plus, this will give them more conference in Bitcoin when they actually have a choice to sell it.

Once it gets to the point where everyone caries a small cold storage device and cash/USD conversation is available at 75% of all the stores then coinbase's current services will be useless. They will be very rich and can move in many directions such as having money to manufacture machines and devices... Who knows.

I'm a trained and programmed biological machine that can perform functions that produce a similar outcome of a bot. Clearly you are trying to perform the function of foreseeing.
Aren't the address's with the most BTC on the ledger? Do you believe North Korea will be in the 1 / 10,000 club? Large dumps from unknown whales waiting for a power change going from having their wealth locked up while increasing in value ten folds. While causing everyone else's wealth to decrease in value.
New sheriff in the next 6 months?

Yeah, it's just me, myself, and I. If I had anyone to help me with anything then I might be able to afford rent.

This has already happened to my bank account on more than one instance. 2-3 days wasn't scary? BTC did go up a good percentage. If it was longer and more banks at the same time... It's possible.
But, if you already have an account with higher limits on coinbase then you can purchase BTC up to $25k. Like a leverage. If you bank transfer doesn't go through you still have the initial BTC value but will have to pay coinbase the initial USD value to unfreeze your account. So, if BTC goes up 10% in the 5-6 days before your bank cancels your payment you can get some BTC for free after selling it back.

This is the highest 24hr volume ever, overall. The ratio of marketcap to 24hr volume is INSANE! These aren't all day traders they are solidifying the bottom.

Ladies and gentlemen!
I have an announcement.
I'm finally reveling my identity.
I'm the REAL Craig Wright.
Lol, even if he was part of the team I'd rather be myself. The inventor of the general concept that produces the 5G frequencies.

If the government is shutdown until they figure out someway to impeach Trump and charge him and everyone involved with lifetimes of felonies, then BTC getting back to just $20k won't be the most crazy thing to happen in 2019.

BTC and the blockchain technology has just started. It has only really attracted a small percent of people mostly under 40 and the tech savvy. In 10 years there will be many more that will become an adult knowing all about it. Thus, more addresses, demand, and the same 20 million BTC. Mean while crypto ATMs and services that every bank will integrate will progress.
The average Joe is always getting fucked with. We could all die from a nuclear attack tomorrow. For no reason and no way to stop it... In my opinion, if humanity continues without catastrophic events then this technology will continue to run for hundreds of years.

Get a nano ledger s. Create the seed phrase, deposit BTC, and tattoo the phrase onto the babies back so they will never forget.

Saving up to buy everything. Been homeless and at the bare min for years and have had issues with several major banks. Due to student loans banks won't even let me spend more than $500 in a day. Still don't have a mailing address for a block debit but waiting until the bull market starts then I'll use Nexo to take loans on my BTC.

There is some truth behind the panicking. There's the hacks, tether stuff, and binance suspending deposits and withdraws. I had nothing in there but it the only exchange I and many others use. It's already limited want I have wanted to do during this pump. But, I don't think it's anything like the day it shot up to 7.5k before dropping due to tether FUD. Either way I'm waiting until at least Tuesday before I do anything.

Hey bro, maybe I'm just used to be fucked over, penniless, and homeless. I've put in 50% of everything I made this year. Am still staying in a shelter. I can afford to lose everything.

Because buying btc is a gamble. A smart person would use the 200 week average as a buying point because they assume the average person in the last 200 weeks have bought in at that price and wouldn't want to sell at a loss. Thus, odds are the buying support will be stronger than the sellouts. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 01:38:39
If that happened a sausage McMuffin would cost like $500+ USD. If anything is even measured compared to USD. At that point all fiat on the planet would be more useful as kindling for keeping the homeless noncoiners warm outside.
