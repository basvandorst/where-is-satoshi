Why would he? BCH is growing and gaining steam, as much as people hate to admit it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:04:58
24 hours is pretty short sighted. It’s had one of the biggest gains the last month.

I gave up trying to run a full node after I couldn’t get past 50% sync after giving it two weeks running 24/7. There is a fundamental problem with the syncing process.

If I understand this correctly, Segwit, 1MB blocks, and the planned LN are the only things that differentiate BTC from BCH. Hypothetically, if BTC fees and transaction times don't drop substantially when LN is deployed, what advantage does BTC have over BCH. People will use the network with the lowest fees and fastest transaction times. Is everyone here betting that LN will be universally adopted and the fees and transaction times  WILL go down? I guess I'm having a hard time understanding what advantages BTC still has over BCH. I know not many people here like this, but BCH is quickly gaining a following and is quickly becoming adopted as BTC fees continue to rise... I'm so torn...
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:40:47
I don’t. I deleted the client a while back. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:20:37
Core devs don’t want to, but the BTC community seems to be leaning more and more towards a temporary blocksize increase as a stop gap measure to reduce fees and make transactions faster until second layer applications are in place. The problem, it seems, is that Core devs have taken a hard line on this in the past and aren’t willing to compromise. To me, it seems like we are making a big bet that segwit and LN will solve all the problems. We just have to hope that they are right... that’s why I’m worried.

I just can't help but see this as a potential to really increase my holdings IF the ETF gets rejected. We all KNOW that the price is going to react wildly today one way or another. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:17:30
seeing as the news of the ETF is not out yet I fail to see the logic of this argument.

what fee did you use? i used 500 sat/byte about 5 hours ago and I'm still unconfirmed. My 100 sat/byte transaction from 26 hours ago is still unconfirmed.

You guys must be using preset fees. I just sent $5800 for 62 cents.

It’s a problem if bitfinex goes under because they don’t have the holdings they claim to have. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:40:39
The prices on different exchanges are due to different people selling and buying  if someone dumps 1000 BTC on Coinbase, the price on Kraken won’t be directly affected immediately. Over time, however, people use arbitrage and the price more or less evens out.  Use the coin desk price index if you want a “stable” price to follow as it tracks many exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:33:44
We won’t.

I wish I had the time to go into it but I simply don’t. Sorry! My best advice is to read all about segwit and it’s benefits. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:56:29
Probably but BTC isn’t being traded. It’s BTC futures that will be regulated. The underlying cryptocurrency won’t be.

Have they ever shown proof of their USD holdings though? I mean it is somewhat worrisome if they can just "make" millions of USDT to keep the market afloat.

It’s kind of a shame that segwit hasn’t even been implemented in the Core wallet yet though. I mean I understand the importance and everything but you’d think that they would be the first to have it implemented immediately after the soft fork so people can see the benefits...
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:45:53
If you buy an Antminer S9, for instance, you’d be making about $500 per month at the current difficulty and coin value. Have you even looked at mining calculators?

Your ledger is fine. The OP may not know about how ledger uses cryptographic anti-tampering systems.

I wonder what these percentages will look like once American exchanges open up BCH trading. 
Edit: Downvoted for a simple uncontroversial statement. Wow. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:02:50
Since my wallet was funded by one transaction sent to one public key, this means that all transactions I initiate FROM my wallet are going to be sent from that public key correct? So in essence I’m screwed as far as sending any BTC until my first transaction gets confirmed?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:26:29
No it’s not illegal lol. Don’t get your panties in a bunch. It’s just a subreddit name.

Mining pools provide a more consistent income for miners as opposed to rare, albeit extremely profitable,  solo mining ventures.

@_date: 2017-11-14 00:33:10
Ok that may make sense. I sent a still unconfirmed 100 sat/bet transaction over 24 hours ago. I made another transaction from the same wallet with a 500 sat/byte fee before the first transaction was confirmed obviously. So the reason my second transaction hasn’t confirmed is because it’s waiting on the first to confirm? Sorry I’m still learning here. Can I cancel the first transaction and allow the second to process or do I have to wait now? Second, what’s the best way of initiating  a transaction without having to wait on the first? Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:22:21
That has absolutely nothing to do with my statement about the Bitcoin Core wallet.

the fee for that transaction was only 40 sat/byte. Yes 5 hours is on the long end of the average wait time, but its not unheard of when the fee is that low. Give it time.

Not a CPA and I don't fall into the "huge capital gains" category this year, but just as a frame of reference, I'm married filing jointly with kids, homeowner, standard investments, IRA etc... Relatively basic tax filing and my CPA charges me about $160. I always enter my stuff into TaxAct as if I were going to do it myself so I know my ballpark numbers but everytime the CPA does it I end up getting more back than I would have with TaxAct even with the fee. Just food for thought.

don't make the mistake of TL:DRing your way through bitcoin. You need to know what you are doing or you could very well screw up and accidentally lose your coins. Go to Bitcoin.org and read every article in the Introduction drop down menu. The amount of introductory material out there is far superior and more comprehensive that any comment you'll get in this thread. Do your due diligence here mate.

Its a market correction. The rapid increase was unsustainable so this was only a matter of time. It'll ramp back up soon enough.

Did you read the wiki? There's literally a "getting started" link on the sidebar.
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:47:45
What? The value of Bitcoin is exactly correct right now. You know why? Because the very definition of Bitcoin's value is the current price. It's the price at which some people are willing to buy and some people are willing to sell. Your valuation is pointless and baseless. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:32:12
Outages on a major currency exchange are unacceptable. I've given Coinbase a few passes in the past for outages, but they have proven to be too unreliable during the most critical times. They are no longer a company that I choose to do business with for this purpose. Additionally, their customer service is beyond horrible. I've had tickets that haven't been responded to in over a month. That's pathetic.

I've had it happen once but it wasn't a big deal. Since then I'll call the parents beforehand and make sure they know what's happening. I also make the kids read about bitcoin and it's risks on their own time before I sell it to them so they fully understand what they are getting in to. It's pretty amazing how much more aware they are about it than their parents for sure.  The principal says he doesn't care I I do it or not because it would be the same concept if I were to post it on craigslist/localbitcoin and sell it there. The clients just happen to be my students haha
The most I sold to one student was 0.12 BTC for a little over market value. The other students are 0.01 here 0.03 here etc. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:54:56

@_date: 2013-11-18 07:03:45
I'm prepared. I love the idea of bitcoin and it's just hard for me to see how it could truly fail after it's taken off as positively as it has. It makes me (and many others) very hopeful as to its future. What sorts of things could happen that could completely wipe it out?
