If BTC becomes the base layer of digital assets it will even be worth way more!

Am I? 11k is not take off.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:36:59
Retracement.  I thought we were taking off?
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:00:22
Take off is 100k. Which will be in less than 2 years.

Its nice to see folks using Bitcoin as a currency instead of just HODLing. It defeats the purpose if we don't start using it.

True.

Banking is in trouble. Just as the postal service was with email and hotels with Airbnb and taxis with Uber. Crypto/blockchain is changing  banking. So yes, banking is in trouble.

At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought.Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

Traditonal Bank acc? For sure, they got your balls strapped. Crypto exchanges are different. Same same but different. 
Can't trust a bank or exchange. Owning a cold wallet is awesome. The whole pie is mine. ��

Thx for sharing. As soon as the IRS was involved with coinbase I peaced it. Coinbase &amp; regulation can kiss my ass. Decentralized is the goal.

Yeah well, I've never had my accounts frozen but I know people who have. Its not fun at all. You feel powerless and hopeless. I guess that's why crypto is so attractive, just as long as you keep your digital assets off line.

There's a lot of things wrong with banking. 20% interest rates is one example. Banking is a monopoly and when sound tech like blockchain/crypto come out, they are fierce competitors.
@_date: 2019-05-13 09:17:20
Credit cards at 20% interest.  Yes, banks are generating $$$. You like paying 20% ? I don't. How much % you pay in crypto?

Where does one buy a BTC ATM?
