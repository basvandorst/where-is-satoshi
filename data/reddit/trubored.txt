I've used it before, it was relatively simple and the fee was reasonable. Would use again.

Yes you are wrong. I'm trying to put a savings wallet together.

I can't seem to have a successful deposit with circle or coinbase so I guess it's localbitcoins for me. :/

Localbitcoins merchants also gouge localbitcoins users. For instance, the cheapest cash deposit is &gt; $20 more than the current BTC rate according to preev.

Well, basically, I want to create a wallet I can deposit, say $10 a week in BTC into, and then hide that away so hopefully one day it will be worth something. Starting one for my son too

Yep all my attempts have been denied both from my CC and my bank account. Sufficient funds are there, and support isn't answering my tickets. 
For troubleshooting purposes: I'm with USAA

I would like to know why you stopped instant transfer without a credit card?

Just used bitme today. First time ever using bitcoins. Cash deposit was easy. Not disappointed.

This should be the top comment. Is there a business reason? A legal reason? Is there some sort of gag-order preventing you on releasing information about a change you have been encouraged to make by the feds?

Bitme.com lets you make cash deposits at any chase branch in the us and you get your bitcoins when you send verification(pic of receipt). Done it a few times now and not disappointed no identifying info needed

sure at BTC+10,15,20%
@_date: 2013-10-11 22:44:59
Well, where's the next place that we can get semi-instant or instant bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-10-11 22:54:26
I don't know, I haven't attempted to make a purchase. At this point I am not considering using them again, so they will be receiving no more of my hard earned money.
@_date: 2013-10-11 22:52:59
I just sent them a support ticket. Maybe they'll respond but we'll see I guess.
