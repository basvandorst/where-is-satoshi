But the value of the gold is not because of its conduction ability.   
I can understand your point. To explain common people, I compare it with gold.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:43:32
Doesn't look like.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:44:39
Why February ?
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:35:29
Even gold is not backed by anything. Bitcoin is digital gold and divisible and be used as currency.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:27:04
Oh yes. I expect 18k by next to this Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:23:45
Merry Christmas..
@_date: 2019-07-25 09:13:19
What is this?
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:53:03
Thanks for my first ever reddit gold. That was totally unexpected and also made me a bit emotional.   
I was sad and was feeling low from past few days. Your gold made my day buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:56:12
Okay. Iam finding it hard to understand whats the deal.   
So coinbase included bcash in their app to buy and sell right.   
So usually the people waiting for this should sell bch right as soon as possible instead of buying as they are getting free money.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:54:20
Yes, only if do it with your money?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:12:17
Did someone there have a Bitcoin tip of 0.5 Bitcoins. Is that tipping is real? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:06:32
Latest one.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:01:31
When is the fork happening?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:56:17
Thanks. But I am not able to understand how to look for 3200 coin sell wall or any sell wall.?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:43:17
Sell it, when it's 10 dollar in March. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:28:21
I have some questions can someone help.   
1) I have only 0.10 Bitcoins. Is buying hardware wallet like trezor worth? I don't have enough money for it Or should I go with paper wallet.   
2) Are paper wallet safe? I am planning to create the paper wallet using chrome in my android mobile phone. Is it safe method. I don't have pc.   
3)Also how exactly to get my bitcoins from my paper wallet to my Online wallet (eg from paper wallet to Coinbase).
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:48:02
It happens. And you aren't at loss because you gained experience. I did what you did at least three times.    
Now I bought again with firm determination that I won't sell result even if I loose it all.    
See it's November now. I think it will rise to 15 k by January start. There are reasons that I believe this.    
Just don't sell when it's low. Until it crosses 15 k (if you buy now).
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:26:27
I am about to create a paper Wallet and trf my coins there. How to get segwit address while creating paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:11:59
This small rise won't matter in the long run. Buy after your verification and all. Then don't think about it so much. See the prices and latest in Bitcoins. Don't sell at loss.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:24:34
Thanks. Also how easy or difficult is to break that wall. It literally need so many people to actually buy 2200 coins. That is a huge number.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:26:44
Woah bot.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:42:21
You passed the test.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:28:00
Borrow money. Buy Bitcoins. Wait till it doubles. Like till 40k. The sell half and give back the initial investment to your friend.    
I know it's still risky. But the results are worth the risk,
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:16:40
Yes, I am just amazed that I made somewhat right prediction. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:06:49
I am planning to hold Bitcoins for a long time period like 2 years.    
So I won't use the hardware wallet after transferring my bitcoins there.   
In the end its just an electronic device and there is risk of it not working after two years because I wont use it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:00:31
When you give option to buy only the bch  price will obviously rise right?   
Coinbase doing this is justifiable?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:07:23
I lost my 0.03 coins because of the recent dip as I sold. And I am losing my sanity by that loss.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:05:31
It is costing me almost 190 usd here in India. That's why i thought paper wallet was good option.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:12:39
Sell half hoold half.   
By doing this you will reduce the risk by half. Bitcoin will cross 25 k by March 2018 is my guess.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:15:19
25k cross by March. Bet?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:04:52
Also how will you arrange beer internationally? You have to cover delivery cost as well. Or will you just trf money for the beer.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:23:09
Thor and Zod.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:55:18
Thats what I was thinking. Rather paying 10% on hardware wallet, I would be more happy to buy more Bitcoins.    
Is paper wallet a good option? Our should I keep it in Coinbase itself.    
(I want to make myself difficult to sell coins that's why i am planning to take them offline)
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:07:36
Why will they introduce only buy option and not sell option?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:39:13
I know. I played safe in that statement. But thats what i wanted him to do, play safe.   
I hope it crosses 50k by march? Is that over bullish? I don't know.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:38:44
In Bitcoin hodl is the best bet. It's really difficult to time the market. Only people with inside knowledge of major event can time the market.    
I am making a guess of 25k till March because if feel it will.   
Also Bitcoin reached 19k and dipped. Bitcoin is rising even after China's ban, bcash fiasco, high fees fud. I think bitcoin come back with more power atter a good dip.   
Dips and corrections are necessary. So don't sell now at loss. Just hand on.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:08:31
It's okay to be insane in love.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:56:36

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:59:49
Does it look impossible now?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:18:15
Indian rate is always like this. Usually on Zebpay the by and sell rate are higher by 1k always.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:17:27
Thanks for explaining. I think I am getting it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:59:11
I made mistakes while pasting the link. Correct link    
This is the official website right to create paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:45:35
Where to see these walls? Which website? In which section? Can i see them on mobile site?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:39:57
Start of January.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:50:52
I know it won't be a regular day.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:26:23
So... Did you sold or hold?
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:39:11
I know it may sound silly questions. But where to put Coinbase address.
Is there a website where i can see my balance in paper wallet and transfer it to Coinbase?   
I just learned to create a paper Wallet using  this (  ) website. I don't know how to transfer it  back from paper wallet to Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:52:05
Also what exactly trading means that will happen in 15 mins? It's it just buy option?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:16:40
I do it. But I know it's not the right method. Just let it be there and then don't care. See price on weekends and free time and browse reddit.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:00:09
Good morning.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:24:57
What is lightning exactly? Is it like fast computer?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:58:17
I mean really. He will get a bit less coins now if he buy now. But the this loss is negligible if he buys now and hold it till December or January. 
It's similar like starting to learn bicycle you fell initially and get small wound(those small loss) then you learn. You understand to avoid those mistakes. You win.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:40:54
Also do we have 15 memes?
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:29:58
It's a future based technology. In far  future humanity is doomed because of various reasons like unstable economy and corrupt politician and bank. Some scientists and scholars came together and introduced something that is decentralised money. But it was too late then.    
Then they came up with an idea to share this knowledge to us. They just planted an idea and it will ultimately change the fate of humanity.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:05:36

Yes, I tried using other apps for Android but I am always back to Reddit is fun app.
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:15:00
How much percentage the value of Bitcoin increases every day? Any average or any informal calculations?
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:06:34
Hey thank you very much. That's the exact analysis I wanted.   
I am new to Bitcoin and it almost feel like magic.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:00:47




Thanks for this advice :P
 
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:42:56
Okay.. I have $1500 as savings, thats it. Would it be wise to spend $750 in Bitcoins. Because I feel it a good move. But thats what I have. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:49:28
Do you know what is the rate per day in the value of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:52:17
So you don't have any other money rather than Bitcoins? Isn't that a huge risk?
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:51:03
I am going to buy Bitcoins worth $150 for the first time in my life. Should I buy more when value rises or should I sell them for profit? And then again buy?
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:00:33
When do the you think 10k will happen?
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:53:21

@_date: 2017-08-30 18:40:17

@_date: 2017-08-31 20:27:12
Is it magic?
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:28:31
How does it make sense.? Because eventually the price will be zero some day isn't it? When exactly to sell all Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:41:13
HODL means 'hold' right?
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:12:31
5k likes means popular more than being nice guy?
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:54:26
I am also going to buy for the first time as you. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:09:42
So what will be the future trend. Can make some future assumption using this graph?
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:27:27
The trend seem to be down. No chance of price to increase.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:24:45
But China has banned Bitcoins right? So only Australia and Japan?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:07:50
What are the major countries that are not awake now?
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:03:42
Hey it's happening.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:03:23
I will buy back. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:43:12
Comma for decimal feels so wrong...
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:41:11
Why Coinbase have these restrictions?
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:45:36
What's the highest it reached 7900?
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:16:47
It is magic.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:55:55
Take your alt coins somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:19:55
December is 12th month, so 12000 confirmed.

 Why not zebpay?

When I buy it dips more. Then more. I buy again. Dips more. Now no money, it still dip. Lost opportunity.
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:35:50
What kind of Good news matters?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:56:42
But still the educated judgement didn't work.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:33:23
Does India have a huge effect of the markets?
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:27:01
Good for you. I am at 0.09 and I will never come near you. I don't earn that much. I can't take loan and invest in Bitcoin(very risky).
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:03:23
Someone else said she instead he said $4800.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:03:32
So you are sending 1000 rs to a friend and bank is down. What's happening here? What app is this?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:01:27
What's the price you now.?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:00:42
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:42:12
I have 0.05 Bitcoins. Deal?
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:36:58
Why price will get lower before fork.? People will buy now so as to get two coins after the fork.    
Price should be lowered after the fork, right? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:11:07
Hey, mine is 0.095
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:39:16
Give O.883 to me. Always keep Bitcoins in round figure.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:45:50
Like instead of giving godl you give Bitcoins to people?
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:38:46
By Jan 15k, by March 20k.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:29:02
Why it's over?
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:14:37
Before that.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:33:39
That's huge?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:45:12
Do update here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:33:55
Before Jan ends it's 15k. Heading towards 20k in the month of March.
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:18:18
Selling now doesn't make sense to me. I am buying now. And probably sell at peak on 15th Nov(which i am estimating). I think it will cross 6500 before the fork
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:39:36
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:42:09
How can anyone make profit with these? Call I sell both?
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:06:09


What does that means? Can you explain? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:58:34
I believe your belief.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:31:47
How can the price go up again?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:11:53
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:35:11
Who is slush? Is he a miner?
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:02:56
Like mining at loss?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:57:24
Google winkdex and open the website. It has option to get rates from other exchange like Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:08:20
Gdax and Coinbase price are same right?
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:40:03
Holy God. This was same reading in my church today. I live in India.   
First I read the post then I thought... Woah same reading in church today. Even in the church, when the preist was reading I thought of Bitcoins. Then I came home an invested more because of that reading.   
Now I saw your comment. I think all churches have same reading.
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:47:01
Why would Amazon accept any crypto at all? The people owning Bitcoin is so less and among them number of people who are willing to purchase on Amazon with Bitcoins is further less.    
Why will Amazon care? Genuine question.
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:45:44
I cannot understand how Zebpay works. They claim that their prices depend upon Indian demand and supply.    
Btw I have a idea of earning because of price difference.   
Let's consider if you transfer me Bitcoins at the rate of US rate i.e 6400 directly to my zebpay account. And I pay you money through bank. And I sell the same Bitcoins at $7300 on Zebpay.   
Is there a chance to get the difference as profit.?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:14:18
25k by Christmas.

@_date: 2017-11-04 17:16:37
Buy some now and buy some after the fork.

What are the major countries in the other side that have effect on Bitcoins price?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:35:59
Now it's is around $6850.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:49:08
But during China ban news came which made it worse. Right? There is no negativity now.
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:55:51
I am also new to this.   
Sharing those Bitcoins number are safe right.?   
Are those called private keys?
I have similar numbers written in the app I am using in "Bitcoins address" section. Can those be shared to public for getting Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:58:12
Yes, will stay strong. What I can understand is that even if there is huge down downswing it will come up eventually. Planning to buy a little more in an event of downswing.   
Right now I am trying to understand if day trading is possible and profitable.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:24:55
I have no money(that I could afford to loose) left to buy it.
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:14:20
I feel it will cross $5000 only after 25th Oct.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:13:50
You did smart thing by selling at peak. But if you buy now or lil later when it's low it will be more smart of you.    
Bro, it's Bitcoin there are price drops but it rises again. I missed the opportunity what you got off selling at peak. Now I don't have money. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:48:14
There other option in net banking that allows you to net bank 24*7.   
I have IMPS option which allows me this.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:51:31
And what exactly the devs update? Is there a software that handle the Bitcoins. Who gives money to the devs?
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:09:27
What you use buy Bitcoins? I am new in Bitcoins and am using zepay. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:12:34
That's an awesome sentence.
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:12:09
Where can I read latest Bitcoin related news? Instead of reddit any website recommendation?
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:21:44
I am new here so can't say much about that. But those price updates and the comments are really helpful for me to understand and make some analysis.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:49:57
What does running node means? Is there a simple explanation?
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:14:27
Yes, I am from India.   
No, not a single person I know owns Bitcoin. I work in tech company and people here are also are not very  much aware of what is it and what it does.   
Probably people trading in shares and funds trade here Bitcoins or make investment in Bitcoins. Common people are clueless.
Also, I think this government won't be against Bitcoins in near future because the masses here are unaware of it.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:48:55
Yes, it was done purposefully.   
What I know is once a drunk guy on reddit was making a typo error as "Hodl" for "hold". Since then Hodl came.    
Any one have the link to that thread?
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:12:34
I am new to Bitcoins. I am actually panicking. But still convincing myself to hold. May be I should buy some?
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:00:58
Same thing I did when it was $4800 which was all time high. Then suddenly it started coming down. Then China ban news came. I sold half of the coins at loss.    
Thanks to God I saved half of the coins on wallet and didn't touched it. The price eventually increased. Now see or came above $6000.   
I sold my remaining half coins again and covered all loss and made a profit.
Don't sell now. You'll regret more.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:00:32
How we know if the fork gets cancelled?   
Also people will sell Bitcoins is the fork get cancelled and there will be a dip in price of Btc right?
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:25:25
Listen to me carefully.    
Don't sell.
It will reach more than 6.5 k just before the fork. There is no need to sell now.
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:52:30
You have last chance to save it. Cry and bang the chest of the dead body, it can come alive.
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:25:06
I bought it when it was more than $4500, so I will be at loss.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:14:41
Which app is this? I am new to Bitcoins. I want an app to keep a check on Bitcoins fluctuations in dollar.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:06:10
Half. It is not advisable to put full of your saving. Also you can invest more later if you feel it's worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:58:42
Thats what I was thinking about. I hope this fork happens.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:15:50
I had all my Bitcoin on another online wallet. I didn't want to transfer them to paper wallet or hardware wallet.   
I sold them at profit. Is that a good decision rather that keeping the coins in the online wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:22:23
I was in a situation and finally decided to sell every bits for a small profit.   
  Here is my Situation:   
My situation is that I have Bitcoins in online wallet that means I don't own the private keys right.? I won't transfer it to paper wallet for some reasons. Fork is coming. I don't understand the Bitcoins technology properly.   
I sold my Bitcoins for small profit. I will buy again on a dip.    
Did I made a sound decision.?
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:10:56
What's the usual trends in Sunday's?
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:06:23
Keeping your Bitcoins in zebpay is safe during fork?

It won't..
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:58:45
Wow. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:06:12
Have a good sleep. That's more important. I think morning is best option.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:00:44
Okay. So fork means when some dev forming a group to deviate from existing Bitcoins code claiming their Bitcoins code is correct right? Thanks for the info. It is confusing and not really simple as it seems. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:08:50
What is hard fork?
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:03:29
You donate me one Bitcoin and I will change my name officially on all my documents. Also will make a Bitcoin tattoo on me. Cool?
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:46:58
Now do one thing. DON'T SELL.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:47:43
When is the fork happening? Is there an exact date?
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:12:48
So what's your further plans.
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:00:38
Thanks for the quick reply.    
Also I have situation where I can only keep Bitcoins in my wallet(like Coinbase) or sell them now at little profit.    
What is more preferable to keep it in the wallet or to sell it now?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:47:08
I hope there is a big crash. I have some extra money to buy. But it's ATH now.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:05:12
Any and both?
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:53:11
How? The price usually go up as people buy before fork right? I think the price will reach an All time high before fork.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:30:34
Buy little then wait and see if it dips now more.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:52:10
Don't sell now. Eventually you'll be at profit.
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:05:28
New here, what is hard fork?
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:04:42
And here I made a transaction of $12 and thought it is influencing the market.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:07:58
What does that means?
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:32:45
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:14:21
I will try to create a paper wallet. Thanks. But in above two situations what is preferable solution?
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:55:23
Don't invest at once. Invest some amount then check how it works.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:16:23
But I cannot afford to loose any money. I still want to profit from Bitcoins. I have less savings.
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:05:49
Whay I can understand is the Bitcoins is divided into Bitcoins and Bitcoin cash? Bitcoin cash works with same principle as Bitcoins. I know I completely wrong here.   
My main concern is that I feel it is somehow affecting growth of Btc.

I am commenting.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:11:17
How so?
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:56:30
Done? I am waiting.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:30:47
It has my favourite twos. Bitcoin and Batman sign.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:05:55
I want to be that guy that buys during the crash. Is there similar crash we are accepting after fork.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:32:18
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:22:27
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:50:53
Can someone answer in simple terms the difference between Dev and miners.   
What does the developer actually do?
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:01:31
Thanks for the windex app. Coinbase is asking me to login. Windex is good enough.
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:09:58
I have a question. I don't know anything about hard fork. I just know it is coming near.   
I have my Bitcoins in a wallet like Coinbase. Do I have worry now because of fork.?
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:32:33
I had a similar question before and no body gave a direct and simple answer. This community is good but sometime it goes nuts.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:17:35
I resisted myself to buy at this all time high. But I failed in that and bought some as I was left with no Bitcoins. Now the price is going down. This time I didn't invested my full money, so I have spare money to buy again when it gets low.    
I am not accepting it to get low as $4800 because there is more big news like China ban. So will buy bit by bit now.
