So I should do what's best for the common good? Even if it costs me money?
Where have I heard that before?
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:22:33
This is actually good news!
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:00:06
And my reply, explaining why this is asinine:

If GHash offers the best momentary ROI, it makes sense to mine on GHash. If mining on GHash causes the BTC price to fall, it makes sense to convert BTC to another currency, such as dollars. 
Let's look at the alternatives:   
*Not* converting to dollars when you know your actions are causing the price to fall - obviously not a good idea. *If* you're doing something that causes BTC price to fall, *then* sell BTC. Or even more profitable: short BTC.  
*Not* mining at GHash - this means you're either mining alone (very high variance) or on another, smaller, pool (higher variance, fees, or both). High variance means lower ROI when difficulty is increasing.
The choice for the profit-focused miner is simple: Continue mining at the largest pool and, if possible, short BTC.
A similar logic applies for the admins of GHash.

You assume the greedy miners are holding.
@_date: 2014-06-14 14:04:13
That's not how it works.

Playing devil's advocate here: I sell my bitcoins for fiat as soon as I mine them. It's of no interest to me whether the price of BTC crashes in a month or even tomorrow.

This is asinine. You're reducing your own profits as much as you reduce the profits of GHash.IO, and you're the one stuck with the electricity bill and the equipment cost.

Ah, the last refuge of those with nothing intelligent to add: childish name-calling.  
Go ahead, do one more.
@_date: 2014-06-17 05:14:43


And the actions of GHash are perfectly rational in the short term. 
In the long term? Who knows.
@_date: 2014-06-14 14:16:34
So explain it like I'm 5.

Contractors have a contract. I don't have a contract. Ergo I am not a contractor, paid or otherwise.
I'm doing what's in my interest. If you expect me to go against my self-interest to help save some mathematical abstraction, you will be sorely disappointed.

Did you notice that "Unknown" went up by a similar amount to what GHash went down? Coincidence?


Yes. Any number of things may happen in the future, but it's not profitable to make long-term bets on uncertain things.
A certain short-term benefit trumps an uncertain long-term benefit. Especially if the risk of the short term benefit (destroying bitcoin) can be hedged against (selling bitcoin and buying fiat).
We're not going to solve this problem if we continue to insist that GHash are idiots that don't know what's in their own best interest.
@_date: 2014-06-14 14:26:37
This is a gross oversimplification. You're not hurting everyone else on the pool B(1-h/H), you're hurting all the other miners *in total* by that amount. The cost to *each of the other individual miners* will vary according to their hashrate.
So if some other miner is mining at less than your hashrate, you're hurting yourself more than him.
This is asinine.
@_date: 2014-06-14 17:23:58
The other miners only have an incentive to leave if another pool has higher ROI, otherwise they would lose money. But at that point you would lose money too.
This is cutting off your nose to spite your face.
And worse, once the other miners leave the pool, you'll lose even more money until you switch pools. And then the whole thing starts again - either with GHash or another pool.
Even if this works (which it won't) and you were somehow hurting the other miners more than you're hurting yourself (which you don't) it's a temporary measure.
It's money out the window.

Their goal is to get rich, not to help bitcoin. If they can get rich by wrecking bitcoin, they will do so.
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:24:23


Of course not. I explained why you can't, and why believing you can is asinine. 


It's not a huge deal, it's asinine.

What do you think I am, a charity? Gratitude won't buy me a new car.
