I am a big fan of bitstamp. They recently implemented automatic verification 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:28:58
bitstamp for sure.
supports sepa and they adopt new technologies fast. (like segwit).
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:56:47

I was running a node, upload was about 30 gig a day.
Sadly my isp believes in restrictions so after 750gb of total use (up and download) they restrict my connection from midnight to midday.
Your isp needs to be happy with it too.

i bought mine on bitstamp
verified in 2 days. sepa deposits usually clear within 3 days

bitstamp.net is a good alternative to coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:27:09
they were on a belgian talk show too a month ago.
Makrs prople talk :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:21:31
I use bitstamp.net
After I spent like 10k they required kyc and got approved pretty fast.
You do need to a verified account, simple id check. For me it was processed within a few days.

Well I had something similar and their site does not like google chrome for some reason so I used edge instead.
Maybe give that a try?
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:23:51
I use bitstamp, 0.25% fee.
Not bad at all.

I am a g2a merchant. they allow to withraw your fiat money to paypal,skrill,bank and yes also bitcoin but you have to have a wallet address, they do let you store bitcoin.
Customers can pay on g2a pay accepted websites using bitcoin,skrill,paypal, etc which than becomes available in euro/usd or whatever currency the merchant set as primary.
You need to be merchant approved to be able to use the bitcoin option.
I think thats the information you need. from what i understood. English is not my first language

the pool fees are about 33% dont forget to add that. I am considering to buy the same contract and keep upgrading hash power for a few months.
There is a different calculatir that lwt you add pool fees. I also have no idea what genesis is.doi g post august 1st. checked their fb and there will be nrws soon.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:31:52
Not upgrading will mean you get less btc since the difficulty increases. unless the price of btc goes up on a stable rate then there is less need to upgrade.
The problem with lower tier contracts is that the payout is so low that you cant keep up with the difficulty increasement. throwing enough money at it will make sure you can stay ahead on the curve. how much exactly you need i cant tell but you can probably find statistics how fast the difficulty incrwases.
I probably will invest 5k too but after august first.

It is PayPal, their mobile app to be more specific.
They charge something like a flat 50c + 3.4%
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:49:18
I emailed them about it and they basically said that i should check their blog since there will be news soon

Some countries allow you to create student accounts (being under 18 is fine in that case) but this type of account has restrictions. Also if you get payments frequently they will bitch that you are a business and force you to submit all sorts of documentation. Been there.
You can open a paypal account in your parents name but be sure they support it, its possible pp will ask for your id, saying you are using the account in name of will cause in a permanent lock.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:18:46
I like that approach, thank you for the advice.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:28:59
Well I see a lot of people advising against mining.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:29:20
Thank you for that, will read it tonight for sure!
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:17:00
Thank you, ill have a look at that.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:17:25
Took a look, signed up and submitted my verification documents.
Thank you.

I am planning to dump mine on kraken and trade them for btc. Got tier 2 accepted this week (took like 60 days) so that came right in time. As of now I got all my bitcoins on my trezor.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:18:03
Thank you, probably a good idea to play around with a little.
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:57:46
I invested like 700$, getting 5$ worth of bitcoin a day but you need to regularly upgrade your hashpower since the difficulty increases. If you poor in enough money at the start you can use your 'profits' to keep ahead of the curve but roi for bitcoin contracts is over 8 months (with current btc price).
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:52:24
I use bitstamp.net but credit card deposits are 8% over there.
I use SEPA option (I live in Europe). Cleared in 2 business days.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:18:28
Ay yes, read a lot about that already. Thank you for the advice.
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:28:02
mine got verified in matter of days. this was 2-3 weeks ago.
