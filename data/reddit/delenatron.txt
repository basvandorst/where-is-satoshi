I’m not scared of anyone selling their bitcoin. Let the weak hands fold. They likely won’t be affecting the price much anyways. People can ultimately do what they want. If they want to sell and finesse theirselves then that is their choice. Just thought I might save a life with this post.
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:03:10
Awesome can’t wait for it! Also, it would be cool if we can see a 6 month graph too :)
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:28:10
LTC is going back up. I wouldn’t worry. BTC should follow shortly
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:18:54
No, it has not been resolved. I can submit my photo ID just fine, but when I try to submit my other personal info such as where I live and my occupation and my SSN, it won’t register me.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:48:21
So if I were to do this, I should definitely send it to an email address if they are using coinbase, correct? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:29:40
Would this bill still be accepted by a vendor?
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:09:38
You would need to prove that it could work, multiple times, and then after you prove it, you would need to show your work to someone high up in the bitcoin world.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:34:27
Who said there is magical fiat creation happening? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:07:33
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:56:20
Just bought the app and I like it, but please implement a widget feature!
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:00:05
Why by March?
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:43:48
Not sure. That’s why I am asking. I feel like any sort of big marking like that on it could make vendors not want to accept it due to legal problems.
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:49:57
Once again, I am not sure. That is why I asked.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:15:41
So does this mean the price would be around $1.50 flat and it would not depend on how large (BTC amount) of a transaction is sent?
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:53:10
Well is it risky or something?
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:08:55
Sweet! One other thing I’ve always wanted to see is a custom graph, where I can put in a beginning date and I can also put in an end date and then see graph just based on those dates!
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:20:54
Okay thank you for the awesome help. The only thing left that I’m not sure about is how to convert sat/byte into how much the fee costs...
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:26:50
From what I know, using a hardware wallet and the Tor web browser is huge. I also don’t know too much though, so I am also curious about this.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:30:03
I literally just asked this question a few hours ago...
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:04:09
All other coins follow the same price chart of bitcoin. Have fun wasting your money on fees just to finesse yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:18:58
Those that are still scared, are those who don’t understand the tech behind bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:33:34
The question.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:15:24
I’ll give you the explain it like I’m 5 kind of answer.
It’s because of FUD and/or possibly some price manipulation.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:55:02
How much would coinbase be and how much would a segwit wallet be
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:57:11
Just spreading FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:08:18
It’ll likely pop up to that price within a week lol
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:48:11
The best way to get around the problem of power consumption, would be to just go solar, or if you live in a windy area, then you could run off of power generated from the wind.
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:50:12
Got it. Thank you. I read on coinbase blog that they will be adopting segwit in 2018 so can’t wait for that!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:49:25
If you really wanted a loan, could you just get one from a bank?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:34:15
This calculated to almost $100,000 in USD not too long ago. Maybe that’s why it seems odd.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:07:13
[here]( 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:22:36
Have all my upvotes for the thorough explanation. I’ve been wanting to know more about this myself and you really helped with that!
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:25:59
Sorry, but there is no gravity involved in charts and prices. Only fluctuations and oscillations
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:07:33
Lol thank you for the advise
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:38:56
You can always call coinbase. I’m sure they will be able to help you. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:23:55
How much is it there in USD and how long did it take to get to you?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:27:20
Good idea. I’ll try this but I know I’m the past, I have set up alerts and they have a lot of lag time before it goes through or sometimes it never goes through at all.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:51:50
Thanks for the input. I’ll remember this if I do get one from amazon
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:37:34
You talking about how much you invested in bitcoin literally puts a huge X on your forehead. Maybe one of your family members will get kidnapped for ransom and they will demand bitcoin from you.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:09:37
I was watching the price dip to around 12,700 as well but the thing is is that we were still trending downwards. We are all human and there is no way anyone one of us could have predicted that is where it would stop.
With all that being said, don’t worry about it. You still made a great decision.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:28:08
So don’t buy from Amazon? It’s less there. Here’s what it looks like: [Link]( 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:56:12
Cool feature but I’d get tired of asking this thing the same thing 100 times a day. I’ll just stick with checking the widget on my phone lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:57:51
Your photo quality might have to do with it. I’ve heard that some people have used the flash in their phone and hat worked. Or you can just stick it under good lighting without any glare. Another option would be to scan it and then upload the photo on a computer.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:15:36
My license isn’t what the problem is. I was able to get that verified. My personal information is what the problem is. After typing in my address and name and whatnot it told me it can’t verify me. It gives me an error message saying “we could not locate that ID”
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:36:56
I find the fluctuations very entertaining. Math and numbers make the world revolve my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:13:31
Please show me the crystal ball you are using. It MUST be broken.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:16:36
Good stuff! Those are rookie numbers though!
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:04:20
Hoping I win!
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:11:39
That doesn’t sound safe lol. If your scared, maybe test it by moving a tiny amount first?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:42:35
[Customer Support]( Give it a try
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:02:44
My license has already been successfully uploaded.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:32:22
Where is this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:46:35
Plot twist. OP really meant Bitcoin Cash. He is fucked and will have to become a t-rex.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:40:58
You still talk about this shit all the time on reddit. A little bit of tracking is all it takes... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:42:18
What do you use to get your news?
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:26:56
The chart must have also been very easy for you to read then with all of the other dips we have had. Join in now and hodl or possibly miss out on the gains.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:14:38
We have been going up for the past 24 hours. Definitely up.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:48:48
I once had a dream it was only worth a few pennies! I was nearly shitting myself!
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:47:19
I am aware. I own coins right now. I’ve just been hearing issues about it and I don’t want to try to upload and have it fail then suddenly I’m stuck
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:38:10
So what would happen if someone forgets their pin? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:36:13
Wtf 3mil for a shirt?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:25:18
I’m waking up in the middle of the night and I have to check...
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:30:03
Bro I just looked at your post history and you literally commented on your post 2 days ago or whatever that you have just recently invested $150,000 in something. Fuck off.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:17:04
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:30:06
I have been using coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:39:32
Hodl brother hodl*
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:32:33
That’s one hell of a sale
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:02:58
How long ago did you email them?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:20:34
Is this a good or bad thing? Cause it seems bad but I think I remember Trezor saying it was actually good.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:52:46
Welp there’s your problem. Small screen so it’s crammed lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:35:34
Maybe your few days of frustration will lead to bigger gains accidentally. It is BTC. I mean, the price of this thing rises pretty quickly.
Please also let me know how this solution gets resolved. I am very curious.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:53:55
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:27:38
What wallet would you recommend to store bitcoins AND litecoins?
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:36:08
Hence why I keep them in the coinbase vault lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:25:23
Are there fees when transferring to a different wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:20:52
So when Litecoin dropped from 360 to 200, would you call that steady? Nope.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:03
Dayum congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:00:11
I don’t think I’ve heard, what is coinbase’s speculation?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:51:34
What iPhone do you have?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:35:19
Guessing a PIN number can’t be too hard though right? Especially if you use a brute force tactic.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:31:58
I’m well past that but I still care. Just addicted to checking it every 3 minutes or so. Always wanting to know what’s going on.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:39:41
12800 to 14000 is a 9.375% move. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:03:21
Mistakes happen man.. We are human.
It’s always not too late to buy though! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:04:57
Interesting. Who was it that came out and said this originally?
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:06:12
You still bought during a huge dip. Consider yourself fortunate! 2018 is around the corner and we will rise!
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:37:26
What about for the other coins that I own?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:25:27
Shit bro this is rough. Did the kidnappers give you any word or proof or anything that once you give it to them, you will get your sister back?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:21:20
Let me ask my crystal ball... yes.
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:10:55
Why until November?
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:30:15
I'm hearing that those are just rumors though and nothing has been confirmed?
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:33:50
Lol you got me
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:04:17
But how do we make bitcoin relevant?
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:14:14
Good stuff man.. Bitcoin can definitely find its place in our modern market and it could definitely prove to be beneficial for these companies.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:16:57
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:19:18
My best guess is that it'll continue to slowly rise like it has been for a bit now. Once it gets to a little below 5k though I expect the price to oscillate back down.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:59:24
Haha 500K would be insane!! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:07:22
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:07:21
Is there a plan C? Cause neither of these options seem too promising
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:07:29
I'm thinking it's time to buy. We seem to be fairly stabilized right now. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:13:47
You can either buy and hodl, or you can wait for the price to dip back down because I think we are going to be at the top of the oscillation soon.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:38:06
That's not the point though. The point is that thousands of dollars shouldn't be invested into something you only have 1 month of experience in because at that point you don't know what's truly going on in the market and why everything is happening the way it is.
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:28:44
Who are some of those best tweeters I can follow?
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:27:15
Before it obviously goes up, it must go up a little and then stabilize there. Bitcoin was at $3300 and it eventually moved up to around $3400 and it's been sitting there for a decent amount of time. It's very slowly starting to trend upwards at the moment.
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:33:46
Bitcoin. Stupid question. Ask me a tougher one.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:59:24
Haha 500K would be insane!! 
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:23:08
Only studying the market for a month and then deciding to invest right into it isn't a good idea.. you should be studying bitcoins tendencies and patterns for at least few months before you decide to fork out a ton of money into it like that.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:30:15

What bullshit was used to drive the price down?

I'm thinking it's time to buy. We seem to be fairly stabilized right now. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:06:52
I'm speculating the bottom is right now. I'm pretty confident it has stabilized and will continue to go upwards from here.
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:26:23
What makes them so shady?
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:47:20
When I tried to attach my coinbase to my bank account it gave me the 2 deposits and I typed them into coinbase to verify but it never worked. They refunded me only one of those 2 withdrawals too. Smh.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:06:52

@_date: 2017-09-20 16:27:41
Great post man.. you are 100% right. Bitcoin is easy yet baffling at the same time. And watching people come to the understanding of why it works and how it functions in the first place is incredible.
