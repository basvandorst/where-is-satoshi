Dexterous has a point. Damages relate to civil claims, i.e. between parties. Theft is a criminal claim and is a matter for which a party cannot limit it's own liability re. prosecution by the state.
Similarly, that clause is very unlikely to apply to the insurance company for the sole reason that one party cannot limit the liability of another party by contract.  The insurance company is a separate entity to Xapo.

This is really, really sad.  :(  
I like Just-Dice, it can be fun, but in the end you've got to remember that you can lose money just as easily, in fact MORE easily, than you can win it.  
I usually set aside a small amount every time I buy bitcoin, say about £5 worth, to bet on Just-Dice.  If I manage to double it, I feel incredible, and I withdraw it.  Boom, more Bitcoin for my money.  If I lose, then oh well, that sucks.  And I stop.
I guess there's just some people who don't know when to stop, though.

Thank you very much!  :)  I will be sure to pay it forward!

Happpppppy 300k! Woop, woop, woooooooooo! On we go :)

But what I'm saying is that it's the larger figure. So if you've paid more than $100 then that's the figure their liability is capped at. Not $100 in any case.

But... why? The currency in the UK is pounds, and most people don't use Western Union.

Indeed. Plus usually the courts seek to construe all-encompassing limitation clauses fairly narrowly. There has been lots of misinterpretation in this thread.
@_date: 2014-08-04 07:27:06
I'm fairly sure your interpretation is correct. I read it the same.  If greater has to refer to the $100, otherwise the clause doesn't actually make sense.

Wow - that is -very- cool.  Hopefully these do the job well; keep us updated.  If they do, it would be nice to see further production and more wide-spread use.  
It would be fantastic to be able to concretely tell those who are unfamiliar with bitcoin that it is fast, it is cheap and moreover, it is secure.
Here's hoping!

Sure thing!  Had a little play around with the wallet so far.  As others have said, the UI is clean and looks nice. It has some cool features I haven't come across in other Android-based wallets that I've seen, such as the ability to add pictures.  This goes some way to personalising those nasty-looking addresses we're all used to and undoubtedly that is something to be welcomed.
That said, whilst I do enjoy the clean UI, comprising mainly of the icons, my first thought is that it may not be particularly user friendly for someone who isn't very familiar with bitcoin.  Clearly the wallet icons with the arrows mean send/receive to us; but will that be clear to a new bitcoin user? On the same lines, the QR code is really useful, but will a new user necessary understand its use?  Possibly, maybe even probably, but in any case, maybe a "Never show me this again"-type introductory screen that makes this clear might assist. I do realise the help menu covers this, so maybe you could sweep some of that text across.    
Similar criticisms apply to a number of wallets, I guess, but might prove useful feedback depending on your target audience. 
Hope the above helps.  I see a lot of potential with this wallet and I will give it a go for a while :)  Will be nice to see how it develops.

No worries for caps.  But that clause basically says they'll pay at least $100. If you've paid less than $100 in fees, then $100 is their cap on liability. If you've paid more than $100, that amount is what their cap on liability is.
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:42:35
I'm not sure that's correct. 
The wording here suggests that at the very least, liability will be capped at $100. I would imagine this is the case because in some jurisdictions, terms removing companies from liability completely are deemed unfair and thus unenforceable.
@_date: 2014-08-04 00:07:22
I've commented somewhere else, but actually, I think everyone here is misinterpreting these clauses.  It actually says their liability will not exceed the greater of the fees paid or $100. The greater of. So if you've paid more than $100 in fees, their liability will be capped at whatever you've paid.

Try going for this approach - it's a little more direct and skips all the technobabble that, to be honest, he just won't care about (at this stage, at least).
"Hi x,
Thanks for coming back to me on this.
I understand your concern in respect of volatility, but this is essentially a non-issue as there are now a number of platforms that convert bitcoin directly to dollars, at no cost, at the point they are received.
Essentially, accepting bitcoin will simply open up our business to a wider audience, with no risk.  I have set out some of the main points of interest below; feel free to give me a call if you want to discuss any of them further.
1)  Payments are truly international - we can accept customers and pay suppliers from around the world with no additional fees.
2)  Payments in bitcoin are final - there is no charge-back risk in accepting bitcoin.
3)  Payments often arrive much quicker than most current payment systems - payments are usually received to our "account" within 10 minutes.
4)  Payments are subject to exceptionally small, fixed fees -  transactions, regardless of size, will cost no more than a few cents, paid only by the person sending. 
5)  Incorporating bitcoin is easy to do, with a number of ready-to-incorporate merchant tools available for no charge - we won't waste management time trying to incorporate this.
Many have likened the current potential of bitcoin to transform the financial sector to that of the internet to transform the publishing of information back in 1995.  Given the ease with which we could incorporate it into our company and the benefits that it could bring, I see no reason for us not to implement it.
Kind regards,

Wow!  My first bitcoin tip, thank you very much :)  I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:10:58
Educating the public is exactly what needs to happen to drive further adoption.  Always a good sign to see people getting out there, letting people know about bitcoin and propelling it forward :)
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:16:16
On a literal reading, limitation of liability is capped at the larger figure between $100 or the amount paid to each respective company.  As such, if you have paid them over $100, that is amount to which they have capped their liability; no?

Seems awesome! Love the Block Explorer.

I understand your point and the rationale that, ultimately, people want to avoid people getting scammed and for Bitcoin's reputation to be tarnished. To stop the convention would prevent this guy speaking and show the conference organisers that their decision to invite him and take sponsorship money from a company owned by him is not supported.  That's fair enough.
Personally, however, I think much more can be done to damage this guy's agenda by questioning him in a public arena.  I think that is more effective than boycotting a conference which, but for this guy attending and speaking, may actually have some really interesting and thought-provoking talks.  
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:26:45
Going to a conference where someone you do not support is speaking =/= supporting that person.  
To boycott the whole conference on the basis that Garza is speaking is an over-reaction and that's what Eric is trying to get across. 
Letting it go ahead, with people challenging and discrediting Garza by way of Q &amp; A will go much further to support the Bitcoin community.
