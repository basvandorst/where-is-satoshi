One time you say that the deposit address is not the same as the user address, now you say that it is.
You can just stop answering, there is nothing you say that makes any sense.

100k$, pocket money
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:46:08
Yes, why shouldn't it be possible?
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:51:43
A question: if bitcoins were in custodial on a per user basis, does that mean that if I traded some bitcoins for, say, dollars, the bitcoins on my address were moved to another address belonging to another user?
I don't think so, which means that bitcoins were not allocated per user, but they were all in the same "basket" belonging to Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:37:13
That's right, but GET the sixty something percent now and then decide what to do to recover the remaining...
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:50:44
This "community" is plenty of idiots. That's for sure.
Bitcoins have to be kept in cold storage, how is that so fucking hard to understand?
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:33:34
Better go to court and pay layers, you're right. Sorry for not thinking about that before! You're number 1.

Bitfinex as a whole was hacked, not the accounts. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:23:47
That's better than put a court in charge, who will surely deplete all the sixty something percent of assets remaining...

How could you be so stupid not to keep the majority of bitcoins in cold storage, after all that happened in the past... go play with lego, please.

Don't be so pessimist...
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:02:57
33%... better than expected... you have to consider that, at a certain point in time, we did think that all of our money there was lost.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:04:16
You're right...
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:43:22
What you said does not make any sense.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:52:51
That may be partially true. Fees are going to raise also on Ethereum, as they are already doing.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:21:39
I am not sure. Miners can double spend their funds, not the funds of someone else.  Moreover, it is known that the security is relative, so you should always wait proportionally to the amount you receive before reacting to the payment.
I think exchanges would be much better if they used the channel factory approach recently suggested. In such a case they would be able to create and fund channels between them and have the blockchain security to safeguard them.
The Liquid approach just seems to me a kind of multi-sig way of storing funds.
Maybe I am too harsh but this is how I see things at the moment. It is true however, that, differently from LN, they don't need to lock funds in advance. But, on the other hand, if the funds are already in the LN, it is easy for them to interact with users.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:21:27
I honestly don't see the advantage over the LN. On the contrary, I see the necessity to deploy a closed federated infrastructure that could potentially steal bitcoins or even be freezed by authorities.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:33:07






What about bech32 directly? Isn't that easier?

How many btcs in each channel?
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:37:25
no, definitely a bull trap
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:52:51
That's not what I meant.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:54:44
I don't see how nodes are going to find viable routes if the residual channel capacities are not advertised, at least once in a vile
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:17:18
Donate a new pc to Luje-jr so he can validate 2 Mbyte blocks and we can hardfork!
Just joking...
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:19:13
Regarding the liquidity, I suppose that the channels between exchanges would have high liquidity, so no problem for them to find paths with enough funds.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:01:03
Now the market is pushing ethereum up because it's easier to do compared to bitcoin. When it will become difficult to do so, Bitcoin will be pumped again.
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:36:26
To increase fees
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:41:04
At least they're good at something.
Made me lose 1.26 BTC though.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:28:08
Because you pay for the consumed bandwidth (transaction size). 
I am not saying there could not be other ways of calculating the fees.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:58:31
I was thinking about the bot needed just to coordinate the transfers (creating invoices and payment requests).
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:22:08
Even with these fees?

@_date: 2018-01-10 00:44:15
What about the timing? The market realizes it just now? Why not six months ago?
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:25:08
Unless they pay for it I don't think. Moreover it's not clear how many btc they would lock into the channel should they open it with you.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:43:05
Segwit is not working because the base size is fixed and who wants to spam just need to fill 1 Mbyte with spam. 
I don't know what we should do though. Maybe an hard fork won't be that bad to give all the transaction the segwit discount.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:24:57
Right, but fortunately, I and my peer could just change the LN code and be able to create a bigger channel... not a consensus critical change.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:57:39
Changed to 1 satoshi also on c-lighning

Fucking genius
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:41:34
Apart from decentralization in the long term, like Bcash.

it's a month that we buy the dips
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:48:05
BitPay should be one of the firsts to open a strong LN hub.
That would be awesome.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:46:06
In "my" scenario, you have no channel open with anyone, so the question is, why would they open a channel with you and fund it
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:10:46
The limit has just been hit, give it time. In the meantime Ethereum has greater inflation because of the higher uncle rate.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:03:53
This is absolutely a thing to remove in the future because it would hamper the usefulness of the LN.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:12:50
Even Mark Zuckerberg understands the importance of decentralization better than the Bcash shills...
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:38:12
We need the LN like yesterday :D
MOreover, it would be useful that users adopt Segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:06:58
I don' see Bcash on my wirex account.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:17:15
What don't they issue an ERC20 token on top of Rootstock?
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:15:45
I am not convinced. A majority of "watchmen" can confiscate funds of the sidechain, if they collude.
In the lightning network no subset of people can confiscate anything, because there are no custodians of funds.
p.s. it's true that the watchmen that cheated would be identifiable, but they could claim to have been attacked, so no responsibilities.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:10:01
That can be easily changed if you and your peer agree. Not a consensus critical change.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:54:15
It seems to me like Bitcoin is an abandoned technology.

Great, just in time for when the card does not work
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:35:33
To get coins from airdrops I think you just need the private key, there is no need to move coins around. Right?
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:41:38
Make a tipping LN node where users can connect to send and receive tips. Maybe connect that node to the TorGuard node also :D
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:08:53
I though Tor nodes needed TCP connections opened in advance between them. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:55:56
Who you paid to through TorGuard?
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:42:21
How so? What about the finding of routes? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:08:37
It is true that it would be private, but a loss of their funds would reverberate to all of their customers, which would be catastrophic.
Now, to steal money from N exchanges you need (at least) N private keys; with Liquid you would need k &lt; N of such private keys.
This scenario can be made less dangerous if they keep only small amounts on the sidechain, the ones needed to be able to "settle" movement of funds among them. But the same can be done with LN, faster, so I still don't see the advantage of Liquid.
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:35:00
I don't think BLW supports splicing, not even today
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:45:21

@_date: 2019-07-09 12:47:40
Don't be so sure... I would like that, but...
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:41:37
I don't know why if they're serious, they shouldn't give me the "crypto-dividens" of my bitcoins. I did not move them because it was very costly to do so. I think I will do it now however.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:32:27
It depends on if or not there is a willing counterparty (if there isn't, the market maker steps in but has to buy or sell the underlying asset to remove the risk from the trade)
@_date: 2019-07-13 23:39:40
Do you use LN?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:18:53

Please, enlighten me, dude.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:44:38
That's the idea. You spare a transaction. If a lot of people do it becomes a significant amount of space saved.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:25:25
They've just bought for speculation, they don't send bitcoins around.
Talk to spammers for the high number of transactions. 100% sure.
Look at the transaction at the top.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:46:54
What? They make a lot of spam transactions and a lot of unnecessary transactions, they could avoid.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:15:02
I've rapidly read XRB paper and it seems to me like a proof-of-stake system. Users vote when multiple conflicting blocks are found. My question is how they make sure the voting mechanism is sound.

Use bch and shut the duck up
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:18:54
Just do another transaction spending the same input with a greater fee.

I think the retard is you. Read the answer son of a bitch
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:25:03
So you clog the bitcoin network to pay for a stupid beer?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:59:17
You put one of your segwit addresses as the second output of your transaction and putall of your bitcoins as input. Use electrum and use "Pay to many" to do that.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:45:40
The statement is clearly retarded, I know... the point is that the "brand" is getting more and more recognition. That's important for adoption.
It's not even needed, though. If the technology is good, it'll be adopted, no matter what.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:16:56
That's not good if the plebs already started asking.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:20:14
1) Not segwit
2) Too low fee
Resend with a proper fee.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:33:12
you can send whatever amount if you control the output addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:22:45
Segwit wallets are not more vulnerable. To spend coins in them you have to sign with your private key, as with the other wallets. Nothing is different.
To steal your coins, the network should hard fork, which could be done anyway and used to steal other coins even not segwit ones.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:16:20
Source or su :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:53:59

Right, but Isn't just the threat enough?
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:54:43

You should confront them and rebut their stupidities...
First of all, you should say: "you know nothing about that...". Then say: "I will explain everything to you at a later time." and never do it.
The true is that they're just envious.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:07:31
$254 is nothing if you get most of it back...
In any case, if it's not make to spam, it's great incompetence
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:37:07
Don't do that just for moving to segwit. The next transaction you do, send to the recipient what you need to send, and send all the rest (all of your bitcoins) to one of your Segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:35:16
it's not 30%, it's more then 40%... in any case... TO THE MOON

You are saying, in a confused way, that they take equal amounts of bets in one and in the other direction, so the risk is automatically offset and they just earn the fees.
That works, but if you had some brain should've already known that, only if the market participants are equally split between bulls or bears. That's not always the case, that's why the market maker that takes a lot of positions on one side has to offset the risk by buyng or selling the underlying asset. That's simply math and reasoning.

BCH is just a copy of Bitcoin with (potentially) greater blocks. The day BTC decides to increase its blocksize (it will again, as it already did in the past, with Segwit), BCH is nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:32:26
International transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:29:34
If they buy and there is no seller on the other side, the market maker steps in, which means that he has to buy the real stuff to remove the risk from the trade (as they basically earn from the fees, I suppose).
@_date: 2018-09-17 21:57:36
You haven't got a properly functioning brain guys. Poor you. Every 4 years inflation is halved, so the same bitcoin output in terms of dollars is mantained only if price doubles. Should be easy to understand but I overvalue average intelligence.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:31:09
Miners are spamming like crazy. They don't want layer-2 solutions because the thinkg they will lose fees. Nobody is going to increase the blocksize, though, until at least segwit is seriously adopted, Schnorr signatures implemented, Layer-2 working...
I am not transacting on a daily basis with bitcoins, so I don't care.

I am not sure this is relevant. The state is not sent around in ethereum too. The old states, moreover, are removed by default from nodes' disks.

@_date: 2017-12-09 13:21:30
The concept is this. If a lot of people think Bitcoin is gonna fall, they will buy short contracts. That would require the market makers to sell bitcoins to offset the risk, as they are taking the other side of the bet.
The reality is that no one is going to short bitcoin. They are gonna go long. Therefore the market maker, to offset the risk, will have to BUY bitcoins, because, as before, they are on the other side of the bet.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:17:25
Not true. You can use a Segwit address as your return address when you need to do a transaction. no need to perform an additional useless transaction just to move to segwit wallet.

With 30% hashrate for Segwit? We need at least 60-70% and then we can simply orphan some blocks which do not signal for segwit, then proceed.

I say do it before.
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:50:29
There is about 30% of hashpower which is neither signalling Segwit nor running BU. What are they waiting for?
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:48:47
You don't have to upgrade. What are you talking about? You can continue with what you have now and still benefits from the space others leave you by using Segwit.

I am not.

@_date: 2017-03-14 18:42:48
Seems that both core and BU have debug on even for production.
That may have sense if you want your node to stop when something strange happens. The problem with that part in BU's code, though, is that it is  easy for an adversarial node to crash the BU node by sending a purposedlly crafted block to it.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:05:12
That's the same of what I said (debug enabled =&gt; assert(0) crashes the nodes).

"Taking a chain which is hundreds of blocks behind and bringing it ahead again has always been theoretically possible, it is just how Bitcoin is designed (for example reversing a transaction 100 blocks old). But it has never been a realistic issue, nor is it for Bitcoin Unlimited."
Oh my God. It depends on hash rates.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:45:25
Migth it be that Unlimited is short for Unlimited Crashes?
So the coin should be called BUC :D

It seems that obfuscating also the addresses is a problem for pruning... that seems an advantage for CT but in fact is not because you can have transparent addresses also in zk-SNARKs...

@_date: 2017-03-07 14:20:30
Accepted by the majority of Bitcoin nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:05:39
I agree. But exchanges should start now telling what they will do, so users can decide where to keep their bitcoins.
As an example, it seems that Coinbase has already stated that in case of fork, they will not give you both coins. Is that true? By keeping your bitcoins on coinbase you risk to lose everything, if the old BTC value goes to zero and you are not given the "new" bitcoin. So, if I had money on that exchange, I would move it immediately.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:43:34
One cannot argue against such logic. BU fanboys cannot possibly justify their opposition to Segwit, which would give us some time and, more importantly, add important features to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
And I am not saying that Segwit is a sufficient scaling solution. It's just a first small step that allows us to plan an hard fork in the future; such an hard fork  may be even delayed in the future by a large margin, if other layer 2 solutions come into fruition earlier than expected.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:45:34

@_date: 2017-03-07 15:21:44
I am not a lawyer. I am quite sure, though, that a USA court will suffice, then most of exchanges/stakehodlers from all over the world will follow.
Off course, this is a measure of last resort: we all hope that won't be necessary (core wins, segwit is adopted, hard forks later on).
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:11:22
Just to add something I believe it's useful: extension blocks are not blocks per se... are just parts of the bitcoin block (each of such parts may be visible to different sets of nodes... the more updated is your node, the more you see).
So the block becomes just a little more structured, nothing to worry about. I would not even be again Soft fork forever if they do not preclude any important functionality to be added  to the Bitcoin system (or if something breaks so it is mandatory).
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:08:47

All this stupid fuss and I just got a transaction confirmed in half an hour with 15 satoshi per byte of fee....
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:27:52
I think the name goes to whoever owns it. Is there a Bitcoin Foundation somewhere? What's its position?
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:39:49
One thing is true. For years Bitcoin has been sold as a technology for  low-fee  payments (micro-transactions). 
At  the very least, I can cite A. A., who always asserted  that as one of Bitcoin strengths (at least in his old videos). 
I never bougth that, off course, because that was the case just because of the very low volume. 
Then, however, LN came.
But even with LN, the 1 MB block is not going to support any future reasonable day-to-day usage.
Therefore, it can be assumed to be a very reasonable thing the necessity of raising the block size limit. We can even do that now. Implement an HF  that raises the block size, during the course of, say, 50 years, until it gets to 144 Mbytes, starting from yesterday.
We don't have all the time in the world. Why on earth a 95% limit was set for Segwit? That is just crazy, as we are talking of a soft-fork. A 70-80% was more than enough.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:29:28
I was wrong. The valid chain is the one accepted by MY node, which is a bitcoin-core. :)
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:47:59
Look at this transaction:
12% of fee...
Miners are making a lot of profits, that's why the don't go ahead and activate Segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:00:04
Well, being the "main" chain does not mean it is the *Bitcoin* chain.
@_date: 2017-03-31 14:49:18
Confidential transactions are a different thing (you have to reveil the sums of inputs and outputs and the addresses).
If I am not mistaken, which I may be, with zk-snark you don't need to reveil anything, so it's much better.

@_date: 2017-03-07 15:40:46
That's not the point of the discussion. I will reply for the last time, even though it should be already apparent. I said that other exchanges/stakehodlers would follow: that's done on a voluntary basis, to avoid expenses. If they do not agree, they will go to their local court.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:14:53
Wrong. The rules states that the good chain is the longest *valid* chain. A BU chain would be invalid.

Bitcoin is the opposite of a generic noun. Blockchain is.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:44:30
I don't agree. The network is decentralized but the name you attach to the token it supports cannot be so. Could you name, for instance, the coin, Red Hat? You could do it in your room or with your fellows, privately,   but as soon as you try to go public you will have to face the consequences (exchanges, web sites, etc., which are not decentralized, cannot do what they want). It's as simple as that. If you don't understand it... then what can I say? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:01:46
The courts of justice. The name has economic value, so, in case of disputes, a court will have to decide (maybe even more than one, depending on the state/jurisdiction).
Imagine that some exchanges decide that one coin is BTC, while other exchanges do a different thing. Who is right? No one is right. Courts decide.

This has been somewhat discussed. 
My opinion is that currently there is no 100% safe solution for nodes that want to route payments. Lnd is the least incomplete but it could still make you lose funds if on-flight HTLCs are lost.
Some wallets for end users should work well because they backup on Gdrive or Dropbox.
@_date: 2019-10-09 11:00:49
That's just an obvious statement. In the previous halving we went from 25 to 12.5 btcs mined every 10 minutes (so 12.5 less). To get the same decrease we have to go from 12.5 that we have now to 0.
So... lol

The procedure is for "controlled" backups that you make by shutting down the daemon, then restarting it. Which is useless because as soon as you make another apyment, the saved state is not only useless but dangerous (why am I talking to you which clearly don't know what I am talking about).

Not enough. Backup and network updates must be made atomically or at least backups should be made *before* network updates. If you operate as you said, backups would come after a new channel state has been established in the network.

That work for a lot of cases, but what happens if:

2) New state is sent to the peer 
3) Computer crash orribly corrupting the disk
4) no backup has been made of the new saved state on the disk
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:54:32
You should ask your peers to give your bitcoins back. They should have the last valid state so if they're honest they could do that.
p.s. I would do it (refund your btcs).

No, this has already been discussed to a large extent. SCBs are not a complete backup solution.
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:56:06
They should implement a real 100% safe backup solution. As of now, even if  you backup every second you risk losing *all* your channel funds.
The static channel backup could work, but it's not very detailed so I am not sure it is reliable 100% of time.
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:59:01
Yes, apart from the fact that people is losing money and will lose a lot more in time when the hard drives that now are running start to fail. Just a matter of time.

Those seem to work well, but I am referring to desktop implementation, which are supposed to be used to route payments on the network (clightning, lnd, ...)
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:54:22
I suppose that if you do use SCBs and you also use an external watchtower (that would activate if your peers, having seen that you crashed, try to force close on an old state), things should work.
p.s. The only doubt I still have is related to in-flight HTLCs that could still in theory make you lose all channel funds.

 It should be perfect, as it is possible for it to be.
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:01:38
With LN is a bit worse. With bitcoin you needed to make the backup of the wallet file every time you created a new receiving address. And you could control that. With LN, if you want to route payments, you cannot control when a new payment is being made. Even if you do, you risk your disk failing while you are routing the payment.
If you are a LN end user, you can instead.
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:54:05
Channels never time out...
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:18:35
How do you backup then?
I would not run a node in these circustamces. I advise you to close all of your channels and wait for this matter to be properly addressed. 
Indeed, I wanted to run one, but then I discovered that no real backups were possible. I would not risk even losing 1 satoshi because it just does not make sense.
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:46:52
I would need a clear tutorial which highlights the possible scenarios where the backup could fail. Otherwise I am not able to do an economic plan to deploy a LN node.
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:07:23
It can be done properly, I suppose. It's just a problem of the implementations.
Backup on the cloud, for instance, would do the trick.
@_date: 2019-10-26 16:17:43
Real backups:
1) A database backend which is replicated on a second machine (e.g. clightning + postgresql + replicated sync postgresql on a second machine) -&gt; not yet available but in development
2) Syncdhronized replication of the state on the cloud (e.g. dropbox or gdrive)...  not available if not for, probably, some android apps

it's over guys... we are going to 100$ again
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:50:01
You're right, indeed we are lamenting the lack of a proper backup mechanism for the known implementations (lnd seems to have the best one, as of now, but still does not seem to catch all cases).
As for the OP, asking nicely its peers is the only hope he has now to revocer his funds.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:43:41
I agree on this, but there is still the problem of on-flight HTLCs which you could forget about, and therefore not being able to redeem them, while the node after you would redeem it against you (and in theory you lose all the value of a channel).
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:01:39

Yes, but the gain is paid in btc, right?
@_date: 2019-10-22 18:05:04
I have seen it. It does not solve the issue. If you make or route a payment just after the backup, you're screwed.
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:44:53
It's not that easy. The backups need to be automatic and made \*Every\* time a channel change happens.

1 BTC is not much according to Allways_Wrong. I don't agree. Consider that most of the world population has 0 bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:02:25
Probably correct

Just bought today another 600€ of bitcoins. Every time I have spare money I buy it and I don't care what the price is.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:34:29
Good to know, thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:45:10
I don't think Spoonnet has really the developer support. At least not now. I think it would be good to know what is the average fee that the developer would consider as just.

Greetings to Jihan
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:00:59
I know, but what if the amount is low, is it convenient to open a channel just for it?
That was my concern.
Your example however is okay, if you just suppose that the deposited amount is high enough to make it worth to open a channel (which in turn depends on the fees on the blockchain).
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:08:59
Why don't we do an ICO to sue this guy? :D

9967.2 on bitfinex
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:20:55
You first have to consolidate all of your inputs (before the hard fork) by sending all of your bitcoins to a new address (segwit, preferably), and then, when the HF happens, send one satoshi from that address to the blacklisted address (so the change that you get is all the rest you own).

You 're wrong. Satoshi was not paid because he was bootstrapping the network. Miners are just a replaceable timestamp server.

What do you mean by nodes are heavily invested?
It makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:51:24
Yes, but we need to scale a bit, even on-chain.
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:58:38
That's a fair point. Bitcoin cash has already 8 MB blocks. No need to have another identical coin (Segwit can be added to Bcash easily).
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:19:57
Why would miners cut the branch where they are sitting? To do such a thing, i.e. rewrite the entire chain, would cause a massive loss of trust in the system -&gt; bitcoin worth a lot less.
Moreover, every day that passes adds an additional day to you 200-day estimation...
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:57:40
Any miners that will stay with BTC will earn the same amount of money as before. The miners that switch to B2X will earn a lot less. Given the current prices.
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:51:06
Wow... 1 million median price for a house. Where do  you live?
@_date: 2017-09-26 10:04:56
There is often space in blocks but these stupid miners refuse to put transactions in the empty space.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:00:35
Not for a long time
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:10:58
LN is going to change that and put VISA, Mastercard, Amex into shame because of its velocity, decentralization and low cost.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:28:28


Sure... the alternative is using multi-recipient transactions, as said.
Does ledger or trezor allow that?
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:14:55
So, if BTC blockchain gets longer (more work) than B2X one, B2X one is erased from history?

Don't replay to that stupid troll. The fact that he says that's  "a bit morally depraving getting in this whole Bitcoin business" says everything about his fucked up attitude. Morally deprave these balls

@_date: 2017-10-28 09:43:12
The problem is not the mining infrastructure, which is just a tool. Perfected as you want, but a tool.
The problem is that constant proof-of-work changes mean centralization. Centralization because to perform them you need someone to coordinate the effort. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:56:28
Is there still someone that believes we can go back up before 3-5k?

You have very likely 0 invested in Bitcoin or at maximum $100
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:00:10
Just out of curiosity: what do you mean by "very large portfolios"?
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:34:18
Yeah, but in the sense that you have to perform some payments first before being able to receive. Or you can have someone open a channel to you. Or you can have the one that has to send to you to splice in some bitcoins in your already open channel.

See however my other response. It's just medium term noise. If you keep your bitcoins, nothing happens. Don't go leveraged however because the movements may wipe your account.
@_date: 2019-09-10 08:01:56
Or the new 6k? Graphs looks very similar, so I expect a dump to 6-7k

Today the market is giving time to some people to load up some shorts that will be squeezed tomorrow.
That is my gut feeling
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:24:08
You can somewhere
@_date: 2018-07-03 09:29:30
This is a relative problem, though. If you had spent the sum you won previously, you could have been able to receive the winnings.
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:43:46
If I understand correctly he reset the fee setting before using those wallets:
" I reset the fee settings hoping it will alleviate the issues I have with sending payments and restart lnd which is currently eating most of my CPU. I make one last attempt at opening some channels. "
@_date: 2018-07-03 09:30:00
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:51:03
Not true. In some states if you hold long enough you don't pay taxes on your bitcoins. On other states, you don't pay taxes if you spend less than $X dollars at once
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:48:29
It's not a problem. You just buy at levels you find acceptable. They will stop eventually when the buying pressure will manage to adsorb all their dumpings and rebound the price harshly.
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:11:42
Now the whales are buying back the bitcoins they sold to dump the price the last time. Once they have rebougth them, the next dump will begin
@_date: 2018-07-03 09:28:08
He could have paid you on chain on a different Bitcoin address.
In the future he could be adding funds to your channel with a splice-in transaction ( a blockchain transaction that adds funds to an already existing channel ).

You seem to think that the only states are the one in the US - lol lol lol
Moreover, $ is a unit of account. That does not mean I am living in the US. 
To go back to the original statement. I am never selling. And spending IS NOT equal to selling, for what I have tried to explain. Which implies that you are stupid
I am not replying to you anymore, because you have not enough brain power to unnderstand basic things
You are sso stupid you don't even deserve a punch in the face
Btw, you are probably working for a bank or something similar... I am very glad you are going to lose your job very likely... but that's just fair given your fucked up mind

7k bitcoins to buy only on bitfinex for that
@_date: 2016-10-12 14:11:02
Segwit + LN is enough for the moment.
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:58:44
There is quite a good buy wall on bitfinex tough. Maybe they won't be able to crash the price too much.

You're right. I had the plan to buy it with 1 but 2 seems fine also.

I think you should not consider this a burst because we went from 2400 to 2200, as of now (the run-up from 2400 to 2800 happened in just half a day, it was not serious).
So it's just a minor correction before we get to 3-4k$ or even more. Maybe even more.
We are at the "First sell off".
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:03:51
It seems to me that it already dropped to 1800 ish...
You want it to go even lower?

IT's TIME TO call off the hard fork. Let's plan it in advance and with the agreement of users and developers firstly.
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:21:08
I managed this morning to close the position by selecting 0 as volume and 5 as leverage, even if my position was 1:1.
I lost more than 1 bitcoins plus a good amount of fees (it's been months). They said they would reimburse me, though.

That's exactly the point; while one loses, people sell other coins and buy the one which is falling

YOu all don't get the point, which is that they want an hard fork which is not necessary at this point.

I've put a sell order at 20.000$... 
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:30:06
There was a calculation made some time ago regarding the amount of energy consumed if bitcoin price were some big number of dollar/euros/some different coin.
For that reason I think we will have to wait at least for the next halving (or even the one after that) to see such high prices.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:18:28
I've done it today

They have gone long on altcoins.

Why should the positions liquidate exactly at 1600?
Btw, we are not at 1600$ on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:14:24
It's a short position... cannot be settled

@_date: 2017-05-08 14:33:24
I have been trying to close a short sell positions for months, position I didn't even want to open in the first place. It was a stop-loss that triggered wrongly.
However, the position cannot be closed, because is a 1:1 leveraged position, so when I try to buy 1:1 (opposite order), instead of closing the position it off course buys me some coins.
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:38:39
Is it already available?
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:29:34
Something like Bitgo where you set limits on maximum daily transactions.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:51:06
Yes, I worked at BTC-E. We hacked Mt Gox and then sold the bitcoins and bought 100 Lamborghini.

@_date: 2017-06-13 11:40:33
There's nothing that ethereum can do that cannot also be done with bitcoin.
The difference is that ethereum puts everything at the base layer, while bitcoin has chosen a modular approach where you have a base layer and side chains for advanced functions that are different than the monetary one. Don't forget, however, that even in the bitcoin base layer has a low-level scripting language that allows to create smart contracts. With rootstock, then, it can do more advanced smart contracts in other high level languages.
By putting everything in one big blog ethereum is more susceptible to bloating and attack; on the other hand, one could say that this allows for optimizations, which is to be demonstrated.

The argument was that the cost of borrowing money on bitfinex was/is high. One could conjecture that given the impossibility to add new fiat money on the exchange the money that is already there is being lended at abnormal rates because of low competition.

@_date: 2017-06-12 14:13:33
Why do I get downvoted? Isn't that true?
Why are they ok with 2MB + Segwit with untested software, but they're not with Segwit right away and 2 MB in some months when ineeded? Doesn't that look unreasonable?
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:50:32

There is a scaling roadmap made by core. I don't remember if it contemplates an hard fork to change the block limit. It should though. 
Maybe, if miners saw that an increase is in the plans, they would allow us to go ahead.

Work around it could mean changing the mining algorithm. Off course, the second time, the blockchain would be much easier to attach... unless the new mining algorithm would be POS based, which maybe could work.

He also makes other interesting comments, like:
"This makes no sense. When fees are needed, they will be 
required. Until then, it is a useless excercise, and will only serve to exacerbate problems should we see a sudden increase in userbase."
I kind of agree with that. Segwit goes in the right direction, BU don't. In any case a small hard fork should be performed in the future, if the fees after Segwit are not in the cents but in the units.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:14:29

That can drastically change when side chains come into production. Among them Rootstock which brings smart contracts programmable with high level languages.
