You're welcome.  I'd say put in on your Quark desktop wallet or Quark mobile wallet and forget about it for 2-3 years. 
I don't know what is DS9, but despite Quark being only 7 months old, it is gradually being adopted by companies. So maybe soon you'll be able to purchase drinks etc.  There are about 700 crapcoins out there. Quark is not one of them - it's a very serious crypto among the top contenders: 20x faster than BTC, $0.00 fees, very secure - 9 rounds of hashing functions using NIST competition finalists instead of BTC's single SHA-256, and an awesome community that is very determined and active.  Bitcoin news with China and Gox have repeatedly dragged Quark's price down, but the coin has a lot going for it - mobile wallet, CoinKyte soon etc.
Good Luck!

Hi ;)
It wouldn't be terribly rude to decline my tip.  I just want Bitcoiners to know that we are all in it together: we all want to build a world without bankers, central banks, restrictions, impositions etc.  Right now I feel that what has evolved is a sense of tribalism around particular coins, which I think is wrong. And Ijust wanted to offer moral support and show solidarity with Bitcoin, which is the grandfather of our crypto.

Haha -This wouldn't happen if you used **Quark**. Confirms in 30 seconds and is much more secure than Bitcoin. Currently very under-valued at $0.07 due to all the FUD and easily refutable allegations.  Throw a few cents at it, give it a try (plus a Mobile Wallet already in Beta), you'll see what I mean... it's lightning fast.
