A little more detail on the issue: 
This is totally the responsibility of Congress. Congress was going back and forth on what to do about these people (adults who were brought to this country illegally at a very young age; think infants or toddlers). Obama used an executive order, **D**eferred **A**ction on **C**hildhood **A**rrivals, to well, defer action (deportation) until Congress could come to a decision.
Congress, instead of doing something, decided to just let DACA sit there with those kids in limbo. Because passing a law would require committing to a position, and committed positions are bad for reelection.
Then The Marmalade Miscreant, shit stirrer that he is, decided to void DACA (cus "fuck Obummer," that's why) and told Congress to sort it out quick. The Tangerine Twit has flip-flopped on the issue a dozen times, but his base is 100% against letting more brown people stay here than absolutely necessary.  It may be the only thing they've ever disagreed with him on, the racist community has throw a fit whenever he's wavered.
This came perfectly timed with a bunch of other important shit coming down the pike like funding the government. Hence the current shitstorm.
Edit: I believe deportations start in March if nothing is done. We're talking around 1 million people. The average age they were brought here was 6, the average age they are today is 26. As I understand it, none of them would be legally permitted to return to the US for 10 years.
Edit 2: Not only that, DACA was a voluntary program, where people had to give up identifying information to qualify. So basically Trump turned Obama's program into a honeypot trap. The US government came out and said, "hey there undocumented people that have been here since kindergarten; come tell us where you live and where you work and we won't deport you." Now they essentially have a registry of undocumented people, making it even easier to find and deport them. Good luck ever getting the undocumented community to trust the government again.

Any alternatives for Washington State? I haven't been able to find any.

If everyone held and no one sold it would’t have gotten to the price it’s at anyway, so don’t beat yourself up about it.

Clearly someone told him to say this. Probably some whale aiming to buy the dip.

I kinda answered my own question with further research. I'll post the link here in case this is useful for anyone else. [cryptodatadownload.com]( has historic data for several different exchanges. It isn't updated daily, but still gives you something to work with.

I need to be able to buy or sell all at once at a given rate. My understanding is buying on the exchange I’m limited the the amount a given buyer/seller is looking for at x price, while with a broker I wouldn’t run into this issue. That’s a bigger concern for me than the fees.

My sense is that you're coming at this from a practical perspective, when this is a very emotional topic for some people. The old adage is something like, "it's very difficult to get someone to understand something when their livelihood depends on not understanding it." You might be running into a similar wall. But again, I have no idea what I'm talking about.

Thanks for your comment. It looks like you're getting a lot of heat, but this is exactly the sort of conversation I wanted to see. I'm a noob to crypto so this is all super interesting to me, thanks for participating in so many simultaneous debates. It must feel like fighting a hydra.

Yeah and I know he has a reputation for being a bit loony. But I was curious if there was even a grain of truth in it, simply because everyone's talking about it. I figured it was a meme, but thought I'd see how seriously people were taking it. I know ultimately none of us really know what's going to happen with the coin value long term.

Neat model, thank you.

The universe doesn’t value anything. Value implies an evaluator, and the universe doesn’t evaluate.

Thank you! You’re a lifesaver

This is my first python project so there’s been a lot of bumbling so far. But I’m successfully pulling data from the API now and i’m ecstatic I got it working.
