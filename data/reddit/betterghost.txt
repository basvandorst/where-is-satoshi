I can’t help but think that a bit more anonymity would be great. Anytime you spend Bitcoin the vendor can see how much is in your wallet.

Because they are a business whose goal is to make money.

Investing, distressed debt &amp; risk. He wrote a book on it not long ago that is [generally well received](

Congrats on earning with Bitcoin. As for advice on not blowing it, don't spend anything without a plan. [You Need A Budget]( is easy to use and will help. You may also check out that community can give great advice as well. Good luck!

But the firmware isn't on the device when it ships. It downloads &amp; installs when you first plug it in. Calling can you comment on this?

They aren't charging what it costs to make, they're charging what it's worth.

What's the 9/13 indicator?

Isn't this misleading though? Most wallets that I've seen contain several individual addresses (apart from the fact that many people have a more secure wallet at home, and a separate wallet on their smartphone with a smaller amount). This is still interesting, but it doesn't give an accurate picture of the number of coins owned by an individual. I'm still learning about BTC, so someone chime in if I misunderstood something.

BTC community is here to help. Share your list of BTC addresses and we'll tell you how much BTC you have for free.

I recommend the original Bitcoin white paper.

Warren Buffet invests. What you’re talking about is speculation. These are not the same thing.

Digital Gold by Nathaniel Popper will explain the tech behind Bitcoin in simple terms, as well as give a bit of its history. It’s an easy read, I enjoyed it.

He devoted most of his career to security. He's probably forgotten more than any of us will ever know.


Not true. A Trezor is worth little without the PIN &amp; password. If the device is destroyed, lost or stolen I can recover my wallets with the seed. In fact they recommend that you practice wallet recovery as a safeguard for if this happens. 
You shouldn't keep more coins on your phone than you'd have cash in your wallet. Everything that you're hodling for the long term should be kept somewhere more secure.

How is this more secure than Trezor or Ledger? Not trolling, genuinely curious about why you'd think this.

Hilarious. I'd forgotten about this gif.

I wasn't aware of this so looked it up. For anyone else that's curious, here's [more info](

That's exactly what they're doing. We're helping them train &amp; validate the algorithms by filling out the captchas. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 08:14:09
Fair point, I have no idea how many are being sold. The reality is, however, that if you want a Trezor ASAP it'll cost more today than it did a few days ago. Trezor does sell them on their website, when I last checked they were on backorder.
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:15:16
It’s not yet clear that they will. It could be useful in stopping piracy of their products somehow. That’s just a guess.

Lot of great info here, thanks for replying.
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:44:46
This is great. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:37:41
Hmm, this is a good thought. I'm going to try this. Thanks!
