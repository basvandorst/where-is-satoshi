True. Getting a feel for market sentiment is important. 
But would you agree that r/bitcoin tends to be highly biased? Compare it with r/bitcoinmarkets and the sentiment there is very different and relatively more well-balanced.

How difficult is it for someone to hack cold storage?
I'm assuming if they were to do this they'd have to decipher the private key so a sub-set question is how difficult is it to obtain someone's private key unwarranted?

Been following r/bitcoin since Sept 13. Personally I tend to upvote news and downvote gifs/memes/price predictions.
It is the hard facts (positive or negative) that move the markets. Opinion and humor is just noise.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:14:57
Guys we are part of something big. Don't let haters tell you otherwise.. they just haven't spent the time to learn the potential that is Bitcoin.
When you're feeling down about the price remember that Bitcoin is a technology, and innovation only moves in one direction -- up and to the right!

They covered merchant adoption in Brazil, altcoins and even mining. Very little on price, hype and Mt. Gox... I'd say it's a big win!

To give you some context my buddy Don and his 2 teenage sisters have been supporting their family of 5 since Oct 2011. His parents Melody and Art Plascencia are victims of Multiple Sclerosis and Primary Lateral Sclerosis and have been unable to work over the past few years.
They are at risk of losing the home where they were raised to foreclosure and trying to raise some money by July 3. They are still a ways away and I convinced him that the Bitcoin community is active in donations and charity.
All help is greatly appreciated, whether via a donation or sharing the cause! Thanks for the help!

It sucks that Josh will be speaking but I dont think it's right to crucify Moe/BTCMIAMI for this. He is one of the best advocates of the Bitcoin community and if given a choice I'm sure would not have GAW on stage.
Events of this scale cost a lot of money and most of it has probably already been spent - venue, equipment, staff, food, ads, website, etc.... He's taking a gamble on attendance since most attendees probably wait until the last minute to purchase their ticket.
With 2 weeks to go it's too short of a timeframe for Moe to give GAW the boot and find another sponsor.

Program is going well. Majority of the bitcoins circulating is from revenue share where Taringa will give OPs a portion of what they make from banner ads. Not everyone is invited for now.. only the biggest contributors. 
Users have received almost 200btc as part of the revenue share program. There are users making $200+ from posts which depending on which country they're in (say Venezuela) can be 10-15X their country's minimum wage.

We work with a distributor that provides us with genuine game keys. If there was any indication that they obtained their keys with stolen credit cards we would cease our partnership with them immediately.
We are able to provide good prices because it has been a great way to introduce users to Xapo's services (wallet, vault, debit card, etc...). Our store has been live since middle of last year and we've never had an issue with a banned account or refunding users. If you have any specific questions let us know at store and we can help you from there.
@_date: 2016-05-26 16:12:13
Sure! Btw i see you are buying in BRL. We also provide support in Portuguese. Abs!
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:33:51
This is correct. Cards can't be shipped to the US but they work here.
@_date: 2016-05-24 21:45:59
If you have a question shoot us a message at store If the code didnt work we'll send you a full refund or replace the key.

POS payments are fee-less if you are using it in the country that uses the currency listed on your card. As mentioned it's USD, EU and GBP. 
There is no maintenance fee as Xapo mentioned many times they cover this cost to the user.
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:56:55
You can see the fee structure here: 
The foreign exchange fee is 3% which is competitive with other foreign exchange charges with fiat cards.
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:26:42
Fernando from Xapo here! Just wanted to be as transparent as possible and clear some things up.
You are correct, Xapo does not charge the 3% exchange rate fee for your EUR card. When you swipe your card, it is debited in EUR and Xapo immediately converts them to BTC. You can check which exchange rate we use in your settings page for the Xapo Debit Card ( which is also your Main Wallet's settings page. 
When the page is refreshed, the price is updated to the real-time BTC price for your card. Of course, since the bitcoin exchange rate constantly changes, this is a tentative price and the actual price is determined at the time of your transaction.
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:35:00
I wanted to provide some clarification regarding the Xapo card. Hopefully you are open to update your chart and feel free to let me know if you have questions.
Xapo debit card:
* **Maximum card balance:** There is no maximum since you dont need to load funds. You can spend directly anything you have in your main wallet. 
* **ATM withdrawals:** $400/day if you dont provide any ID or proof of address. Goes up to $2000/day as soon as you provide this info 
* **POS purchases:** Up to $2500 without ID/address. Becomes unlimited when you provide this info 
* **Monthly fee:** Was removed in September last year. We pay for this so there is no charge.
Note that we are not a preloaded card. Meaning you dont need to spend btc in order to load fiat onto the card. We withdraw btc on the spot when the card is swiped.
The rest is correct. Let me know if I can clarify anything else.
@_date: 2015-03-26 05:06:35
It's hard for us to answer this without knowing specifics. Would you cash out 100% of your salary onto fiat? Do you sell your bitcoins at an exchange or try to use them at btc-friendly merchants? These will all set a different base price to compare against.
Comparing fees may not be the prettiest way to answer your question but it gives you a clear picture. If you choose the Xapo/Bitwage route and spend btc in a currency that is not USD/EUR/GBP there is a 3% FX fee if you pay at POS. There is also $4.50 at ATMs. You can cash out up to $2000/day so this would equate to 3-3.5% total. Btw these fees are set by our card issuer, not Xapo.

You call me a crook and a liar, makes these claims that I owe you btc and then go back to your cave when asked for clarification. Why dont you explain yourself and if there is a mistake let's make it right.

sorry, just found my answer.
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:24:35
Fair points There is no excuse for having the app not properly opening or requiring full verification for a few bits. While I dont have a solution for you today I can promise we are working on improving this. 
We never charged transaction fees. Previously we charged 0.12% per year in btc (upfront) for coins stored in our deep cold storage Vault. As of the start of this year we've removed this and made the vault free. In fact, we also reimburse all miner fees for your transactions, regardless if sent on or off the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:26:37
Hi guys, Fernando from Xapo here.
We've partnered with Mandelduck because Sarutobi has created a great use case with bitcoin microtransactions and gaming, providing an easy way to onboard new users who can earn bits with their time (as opposed to purchasing btc from an exchange). There are a number of indie game developers who are looking at incorporating btc into their games. We want to help make this worthwhile from a time and money POV.
Xapo's connection is to help keep their donation pot full so users (you) can continue to receive bits for playing.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:05:57
What I want is to know why you think I personally owe you bitcoin.  If you think I do, send me a direct message explaining why. Libeling people publicly is not a solution.
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:12:45
