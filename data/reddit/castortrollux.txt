How is one elite better than the other?

Yep Bitcoin is one step closer to eradicating money once and for all!

So what you're saying is, ultimately Bitcoin is dependent on wealthy individuals, such as bankers and hedgefund managers, investing into it and thus doing what they can in preserving the currency as the number one cryptocurrency ... the exact thing it was allegedly designed to avoid.

Wet dreams to some, nightmares to others.

True, but now we have the technical capability to provide these things for everyone at a reasonable cost, yet we don't, because corporations must make ridiculous profits.

This is just ridiculous. Maybe this is a mistake on my part but I'm not buying any right now, it's just too volatile for me. I'm sticking to my alt coins for the time being. Congrats to the early adopters though, wish I would've bought some BTC a few years back.

Yep. Banks hate Bitcoin because they can't control it, and they can't make an agreement with the people who control it to get an advantage, because no one entity controls it.
Ripple is more likely to be accepted by banks and governments. It's not a decentralized cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, but it is a digital currency that's issued by Ripple Labs, and it does have some of the advantages of Bitcoin (such as quick transactions) and some of the disadvantages of conventional currencies. One thing I do like about Ripple is that you get XRP by donating computing power to a worthy cause like cancer/AIDS research instead of wasting it on generating hashes (yes yes it's not entirely wasted but you get my point).

It's a little greed.

Same. I even had some spare cash back then, but I was just too lazy.
