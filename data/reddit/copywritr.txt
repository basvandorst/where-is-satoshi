let's see how patient the market is. everybody may flock to another alt before LN is implemented by enough parties to lower fees.

Do you even Bitcoin?

i couldnt believe that when i last used electrum, the fees were too low even after maxing out the fee in the UI (2.7.1). thanks viabtc for confirming
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:37:04
thanks for the advice. will make sure to do this in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:45:34
i did and it still was too low. 
enabled dynamic fees, checked satoshis per byte, looked at 21.co's estimation and it would have taken 6-INFINITY blocks to confirm. glad the devs made this update so other people won't have to have the heart attack i did. thanks again viabtc.

Bitcoin's price rise of 2013 is often credited to the Cyprus bank crisis... we still don't really know for sure if that actually caused the price to go up. So, we can't really say what's causing the price to go down down down in a matter of minutes.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:06:29
it seems to me that u/freewizard93 bought bitcoins at $1,100+ ... by using the term "manipulators" in multiple comments, you're just revealing that you've lost some money.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:03:51
Like 2013, we have crazy drops like this within minutes. Your explanation means nothing.

Extreme panic and extreme optimism are both still delusional.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:15:48
you're right. but OP's statement is like believing that getting sick is a gift that gives the opportunity to get healthy again. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 11:45:14
What has r/bitcoin become? ... "They need to make it a law" ... No, they don't need to make any law. Let the market learn that this currency is volatile, that's a healthy solution.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:44:49
seriously, i dont get it. 
less transactions does not mean faster blocks. could there possibly be a bug? something isn't right.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:40:53
For those who don't know, it should be 144

Do you need to be a paid shill to point out simple facts around here?

BCH was forked to remove the block size limit. That's a reason, whether it's "good" depends on your opinion. It attempts to solve the scaling problem via extending the block sizes. It's probably a club-footed approach, but it's a decent attempt.


The 2nd most-popular crypto currency by trading volume, and 3rd most popular by market cap is not a rejection of the market. There is a market for it, and it's still larger than the demand for Litecoin, which in my opinion, is no better than a BTC testnet.
Please don't think I'm peddling BCH around here. BTC is and always will be king! We're on the same side with different opinions, that's all I'm trying to say.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:45:51
because you're redefining "bitcoin" to include things outside of bitcoin. The only part in that whole stack that is exclusively "bitcoin" is the "bitcoin blockchain." Replace that with any other blockchain and it still works!
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:02:34
you can't separate these two things... store of value AND means of transfer is necessary for this to be money. google "money" and read the contents of the results. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:09:22
Either this sub has completely lost it, or Ver is going Trump-style crazy by shilling himself into more power.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:59:44
the immaturity and elitism of r/bitcoin is really hard to swallow lately.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:06:08
two things: 
* it's cheaper to forge/counterfeit a block of bitcoins than bitcoin cash coins
* educate yourself more on the importance of mining power as a way of securing cryptocurrency networks
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:26:39
ugh. this is so lame
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:00:49
i couldn't even compare BTC to alts without getting my post deleted
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:53:17
I'll try to be helpful, since nobody else in r/bitcoin seems to care about answering your question.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a different cryptocurrency than Bitcoin (BTC) that uses the history and code of Bitcoin up until August 1st, 2017. After that, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) split, or "forked", from Bitcoin to remove the arbitrary 1MB block size limit that is still activated on Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin (BTC) has since upgraded the code to include a new feature called Segregated Witness (Segwit), that provides BTC with the ability to put more transactions in each block without increasing the blocksize per se, as well as enable other code to more easily run on top of Bitcoin. Both cryptocurrencies have different values, different users, and different maintainers of the code. There was A LOT of drama around this, as you can see from the not-so-helpful comments in this post.

Never has it broke 50%. Do not downplay this. This is huge.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:57:27
Because the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) mining network is now the most powerful mining network in the world. From the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, Bitcoin (BTC) always was had most powerful Cryptocurrency mining network. For the first time in history, this is no longer true.

@_date: 2015-11-03 11:25:30
This is great. You've just expanded my possibilities of spending bitcoin by a factor of 10.
@_date: 2017-05-03 13:10:36
Thanks for the helpful explanation. I've recently used bitcoin at another establishment and they had 0-confirmation acceptance. I looked into the Blockchain Merchant app and it's definitely outdated.
As for the fees: I don't care what technical solution lowers them, as long as that happens soon. Situations like this make me look like a fanatic to my friends— I really couldn't justify buying a coffee with that fee. 
**"Fee market"** ... That's an interesting term. I think it's a misnomer actually, as it actually seems to be a "Transaction market" where the price on the transactions is the fee (e.g., you wouldn't call Bitcoin a "Dollar market" if you're referring to its USD price). If you're correct that there is this "transaction market" then there is a limited supply of transactions, like bitcoins themselves. This can NOT be good, unless there's something here I'm forgetting.
