I'm assuming this is the cause of the price bump today (now $12,186)?
@_date: 2019-07-04 10:43:50
So how do you day trade without getting torn up with transaction fees?

Area 52 - to throw everyone off
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:17:13
Yeah, well, some of us bought in January 2018 - so we are ON the moon waiting for someone to come pick us up.
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:20:50
Yes, thanks for that.  Correlation &lt;&gt; causation.  You're right.
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:50:05
It looks like people are getting out of alts and jumping into BTC.  Prices seem to have decoupled.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:38:23
Fed Chair validates Bitcoin as store of value...
Price drops.
@_date: 2019-07-12 09:47:50
Yeah, you're right.  I'm too reactionary and short-term.
It was just a joke.

@_date: 2018-08-08 23:38:43
I've got $37K invested, and it's currently worth $15K.  At this point, the loss would be so horrible, I CAN'T sell.
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:59:09
Well, it appears they are following this order.
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:54:03
My prediction (which is just as accurate as yours) is that the last part of this graph will be as true as the first part.  Cause we all know how huge of a gain we've had since January.
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:43:47
I guess the mantra is "use it to buy things."
So HODL should be USLE, or something.
@_date: 2019-11-23 01:10:34
I stupidly FOMO'ed in.  At 13K, 9500, 7800, 11500, etc.
I won't say how much I've spent, but let's say I've bought... a few.
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:34:00
I've lost $9K in the last 3 weeks.
Don't remind me of this.
@_date: 2019-11-23 01:07:30
Not trading - just HODLing.  But it's sad to watch your investment get smaller.  And smaller.
I'd like to propose a revision to the "if you don't like..." comments:
"If you can't stand 20% losses, then you are REALLY going to hate 40% losses."

Exodus.io has a wallet, but I don't think you can buy more coin on it.  Coinbase has a wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:01:39
OK, but let's play Devil's Advocate for one moment...
If he DOES have control of a substantial number of BTC, he would have to give up half.
And if this happens, 40% of that sum would need to be liquidated to cover Florida inheritance tax.
And THEN, if the government says "pay us all at once" - how would that work?  If you crash the market with a huge dump, then the total BTC would be worth far less.  The winning party wouldn't have enough to cover the whole tax bill.
So they'd have to sell it ALL - which would depress prices further.
If only the government accepted BTC.  Who knows, in this strange case, they might?
@_date: 2019-08-10 00:41:17
Yeah I wonder what his unstable coin is.
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:53:13
So let's say you have coins on an exchange - what's the best, future-proof way to transfer them to paper?
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:25:11
I'm rather terrified by this.  More so that he backs it up with facts.
I'm long on BTC, but I would think this would also call for "The Big Short 2.0" this time betting against... what?
@_date: 2019-08-30 10:20:15
Yeah, it worked out so well for LTC recently.  Can't wait.
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:17:34
If you're a US citizen, don't think for one second that your government gives a shit about your buying power.
It doesn't.  This lowers the cost of borrowing more.  For them.
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:57:27
Pomp it up
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:56:09
Hopefully it will stay correlated to gold, but if it goes up like gold, we've got bigger problems.  I'd rather it go up because it's a new asset class and everyone is diving in.
@_date: 2019-08-18 20:54:23
Well, apparently the site will reveal something about "his 980,000 BTC" tomorrow at 4pm Eastern.
I think Charlie Lee and others are right - if you can't show proof by showing something about the genesis block, then it's all for nothing.
Plus, who on Earth would want to say "I've got hundreds of thousands of BTC and here's my name".  That would be inviting bad elements to seek you out.  I don't know.
@_date: 2019-08-10 00:46:01
Hey!  I've got the best deal!  You give me 1 BTC and I'll give you 100 BTC tomorrow!  What a deal!
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:58:06
Unfortunately, I have but one upvote to give.
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:31:19
I understood that most of those things ARE words.
After that... dunno.
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:54:00
They didn't ban it.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:58:59
OMG that makes me feel so much better!
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:28:05
Unfortunately, it has.  In the last 24 hours, BTC has risen 11.2% in price.  In ONE DAY.
The market is certainly different than in late 2017.  But did adoption increase 11% in a day?  Did BTC's utility increase 11% in a day?  Nope.  It's someone driving up the price too fast.
Which means speculators just hop on to ride out the bump.  And they will have no problem selling when it starts tipping over.  Then the rats will leave the ship and we're back where we started.
EDIT: It's 4 days later, and I've made another 5K.  I'm actually not happy about this.  If BTC goes up parabolically then it'll drop just as quick.  That's not good for the market.
@_date: 2019-06-23 10:49:23
Yeah, we can hope for price stability, but markets are going to see wild swings up and down as FOMO pushes up and speculators push down until we see a stable range.
I feel like until that time, institutions will still be curious but not make major plays in the space.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:01:40
I was less than sober and bought .9 at around the $13K level last night.  I started kicking myself, then...
I realized that the gains were happening too fast.  20% / day is not sustainable.  Just hodl and wait.  By all means do NOT sell right now - there are folks out there that are convinced that buying your BTC NOW is the best thing to do, so they'll buy it if you sell now.
But if you DON'T sell, just ride it, you'll be glad you did.
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:19:30
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:22:55
Roger that.  Unfortunately I've done both. ;-p
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:47:41
Aaaaaand it's almost back in the same day.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:44:00
Us older investors recall the good old days when BTC was $12K...

@_date: 2019-06-26 22:00:42
Noobie, weak hands is why.  Nobody expects the price to FLUCTUATE day to day.  They just expect miracles daily, and for those miracles to never stop.  Ugh.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:39:09
It's OK guys, we are basically where we were at YESTERDAY.
But to answer your question, apparently somebody on Bitmex apparently did a huge BTC dump.  Idiot.
HODL and carry on.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:26:00
Somebody's making a BIG buy right now.  FOMO or not, I welcome it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:43:28
Some whale is fucking things up.
@_date: 2019-10-20 17:54:30
I'm assuming the people posting FUD want the price to go down so they can buy more (which they wouldn't ever tell you that - it reeks of greed and hypocrisy).
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:02:52
Aaaaaand even higher.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:01:34
Yeah, I had a chance to buy BTC at 11,500 for a second.  I didn't and should have.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:14:36
Usually 5M on cryptowat.ch or coinbase.  I bought in a little higher than today, but just give it time.  I'll hodl this for a long while, and you'll kick yourself in a year or two for not buying now.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:53:25
It doesn't give a fuck.  It's hungry.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:01:54
I'll be honest, man... if you can pay off your student loan now, that might enable you to buy a house sooner.  If you can swing a home with the cash now, and keep the loan, then I'd buy the home sooner.
But I'd wait to see how this plays out.  It's not over yet.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:55:14
I think we are seeing FOMO, but different from 2017.  Still there, primed, ready to buy.  In fact, buying in.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:54:42
Yeah, I bought .9 at $13.2K level.  I feel like an idiot - need to do slow, incremental buys, not big ones during massive moves.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:54:02
Or my ex-wife.
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:50:56
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:46:03
Yeah after the dump we're only 9.87% up today.
OH NO!  SELL SELL SELL
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:31:53
I sold 100 LTC to buy BTC a week ago - at $9500.  I'm happy I did.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:55:47
A good adjustment!  This is what we need.
@_date: 2019-06-19 10:22:39
Well, it really depends on how established crypto is at the time of the crisis.  AND more importantly, what kind of crisis it is.
For instance, Venezuela's economy is in free-fall right now, and people are buying BTC there to hedge against hyperinflation.  Their currency is worthless - so this is a good use case for crypto.
But in a financial crisis in which the currency's intrinsic value does NOT drop to 0 (like 2008), I would think people would get out of crypto to free up more fiat to buy stuff.  In that case, prices for BTC etc. would drop, maybe a lot.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:32:15
Look up to the skies and seeeeeee....
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:33:44
So YOU caused this... usually it's me. ;-p
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:21:51
I hate to be laughing, but I am.
I'm also 2 drinks in.

There's nothing wrong with that.  Spend only what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:10:25
How happen such thing?  No believe or what?  What do?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:54:45
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:50:14
That's why weak hands panic and sell when they see that huge drop.  Whales make money off weak hands.  If you just wait it goes back up.
See?  It's going back up now.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:56:52
It'll go to $45,872.94 on October 25, 2019.
Oh, you don't think that's true?  I wonder why not?
Maybe because it's hard to say where it will go.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:47:12
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:58:06
I just bought another BTC.  Joy.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:59:51
I guess it's all in the timing amirite?
@_date: 2019-09-04 12:52:36
Agreed.  If anything, more mining means more supply, not more demand.
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:30:28
Well, you could tell him to pay for it himself - that's what many of us had to do.

@_date: 2019-09-26 19:47:44
The market is currently in its infancy - so speculation is driving the market.
This is not exactly how it will be in the future, however.
In the future, BTC will act as a store of value due to its limited number, and application as borderless currency.
At the very least, think of it as the potential to spend a little money on something now that could buy you a lot more in the future.  Instead of spending 10,000 BTC on a pizza order, think of how much you could buy with that same BTC today.
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:02:24
Yeah, I've not seen any 600% gains ever (timing of investment), soooooo...
If you want to tell me to go back in time and buy BTC at $450, and that's why I should "zoom out", well, it's tougher to see that.
But I have a true belief in BTC (unlike most speculators) so I will HODL long term.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:19:13
That may be true (in that they say that's the reason).  Of course, they would be ignoring the fact that the metal markets, LIBOR, and probably just about everything else has been manipulated from time to time.
They're not as bright as they want you to think.
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:13:44
Consider your words marked.  We'll chat later.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:17:06
What just happened?  Just bought another .25 BTW.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:47:23
I believe in the future of digital currency in a similar way I might believe in the future of a company's growth prospects.  This is literally a new investment class - and it's in its early days.
Sure, we're going to have some bumps in the road.  But if I sell now (at a loss) I definitely lose money, whereas if I give it a year or two I MIGHT lose money.  But I definitely won't gain anything if it does turn into a store of value, and BTC's scarcity causes it to rise in value.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:29:44
Welp, I do hope we go back up.  If it goes down further tomorrow, I'll buy more, but that's as far as I can go, money-wise.
Then we wait.
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:29:08
Poor bot, downdoots a plenty.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:26:00
I thought everyone was seeing that futures market as a positive, bullish thing for BTC.  This seems rather sudden (like in the last hour).
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:17:06
"Sources" - if these folks are psychic, I'd really like to ask them some other questions.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:18:19
Any particular event, news or reason?
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:48:44
I'm not up on that process, to be honest.

Gotta hand it to Kim - that guy is a ninja when it comes to escaping from extradition.  Wasn't he supposed to be arrested for something recently?  I'm out of the loop, sorry.
@_date: 2019-09-04 14:09:29
I'll be the first to admit I'm no expert (in anything).  I guess what I was trying to say is the fact that having more miners churning away doesn't equate to more people suddenly appearing to want to buy / adopt BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:18:55
Best advice anyone can give you: BUY your chosen currency with your money and wait.  Honestly, I'd wait until after the hard fork, then jump in.
Why do I say this?  Because with mining, you'd have to mine enough to recoup your investment first, before you made your first penny in profit.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:08:11
I bought half of what I wanted to - I'll give it another couple of days and buy the other half if it continues down.
EDIT: And I did wait.  I bought my first .25 at 8700 and my second .25 at 7800.
I didn't have the sense to do this in the past.  Will do in the future.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:12:52
FUCK YEAH CAPS LOCK
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:10:36
DON'T SELL NOW.  That is "weak hands," and the true traders will thank you.  If you have any cash left, wait a few more days - if it dips huge, buy more - it will "dollar cost average" your entire purchase down, which will make the coming rise bearable.
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:13:44
Just wait - you don't lose money until you panic sell.
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:23:03
I can't remember the exact history, but I seem to remember they bought in at a very low price.  Might want to look that up.
But yeah, they're doing very well, and the ONE THING that will continue that trend is if people buy in as well.
@_date: 2019-05-22 19:39:23
Whoever got the 10,000 BTC - did they keep it or throw it awaY?
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:32:41
Well of course they would say that.  They own lots of it.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:32:33
This is what I never understood.  They have cancelled checks don't they?  There has to be some kind of paper trail where disbursements were documented.
If [trillions were truly spent, but unaccounted for]( to the point that they couldn't complete an audit - **it was done on purpose**.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:45:10
Timing could not have been better - $352 and falling fast as of today.  Glad I sold this morning.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:22:44
I have had a quick adventure in this world, buying 2.00 B at $2600 and 2300, selling last Thursday at $2700 and buying 18.7 ETH at 278 on Friday.  Cashed it all out today at 389.  I turned $5300 into $7200 in a matter of days.
He's right - it takes commitment to know when to buy and sell without emotion.  I agree that Ethereum is the future, but we're not there yet.  I'll buy in again on a major dip.
