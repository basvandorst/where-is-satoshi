Oh really? Man do I regret selling them at 1200$.

Now I wish I did that, but i'm going to be fair. I sold at 1085.36 and bought at 525.27 back in to sell at 680.31 to check out most of my holdings. That was a couple years ago so...yeah.

As a VWO student who is doing these exams I can tell you that many complaints were sent in. However I enjoyed reading the article and was thrilled to see something else than pages full of feminism or obesity articles, which sadly litter the exams. No offense towards feminism or the problem of obesity...I just don't want to read similar articles in every god damn exam subject I have.  
Shame it's all in Dutch because the Macro/Micro Economics exam was all about inflated currencies and central bank strategies.
