It's a system for handling pre-IPO trading between a handful of companies, run by Nasdaq. It will be legally required to have auditing systems in place strong enough such that all the parties can trust the central party (Nasdaq) to run it, balance the books, and prevent double spending. All that is required is undeniability for the transactions, which can be achieved using standard public key cryptography. No blockchain is needed.

Yes, but to make it legal first you must
* 1) stand up and point out that the flag in the courtroom has a golden fringe which makes it an admiralty court
* 2) demand the judge to present her captain's licence 
* 3) when she admits she doesn't have one, yell "abandon ship" as loudly as you can

They are not "stealing purchasing power". The purpose of devaluation is to increase the competitiveness of the local export industry and fix a current account deficit. It is basically what happens naturally with floating exchange rates.
@_date: 2015-05-11 14:37:04
Because it does not actually require bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-05-27 11:58:22


International trade ...but with bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:19:15


No, you're not. Devaluation only affects the prices of imports, exports and debts denominated in foreign currencies.
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:28:25
Well, transaction malleability is already mentioned in the wiki so the issue is like 80% solved.

@_date: 2015-05-19 09:20:12


Technically true but only because they will never be able to sell any of their devices. However, that hasn't stopped them from claiming 75% of the theoretical future satoshis mined by their vapourware. Makes perfect sense!

I guess my point was that storing a hash of Gutenberg data on the blockchain is a completely pointless publicity exercise. It might be slightly different if the Project Gutenberg itself committed to a specific hash at a specific date to prevent themselves from changing the data without anybody noticing, but a third party doing this is meaningless unless I've already decided to trust them.

Let me put it this way.
[Modern mainstream economics is largely based on Keynesian ideas]( which explains your professor "promoting" it.
Austrian economics, on the other hand, is a heterodox theory and is considered embarrassing unscientific quackery by the majority of economists.
