You're ignoring layer 2 solutions completely. And the fact that another incentive for mining Bitcoin is to be able to have and use a decentralized cryptocurrency. There's more than financial incentives in the world.
When all Bitcoins will be mined we will be in the year 2140. Will the hodl mentality still apply? Yes and no. Yes because well do you have a savings account? No because we will be spending it to buy goods and services that will be priced in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:07:43
I did but I used the Bitcoin at the time to invest in alt coins. It's all good though, my altcoin investments have gotten me lots of Bitcoin!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:58:28
If it drops below 5K holy crap am I ever gonna buy 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:01:52
I’ve looked into this, bitcoin gains are only taxable once you convert back to CAD. Then it’s taxed as capital gains. So your initial investment isn’t taxable (because you already paid tax on it) and then only 50% of your net profit can be taxed. Your capital gains are then only taxed based on your income without the investment so your yearly revenue from your job. So all in all, you’re only taxed 19% on your profit if you’re in Ontario and make Between 25000 and some other limit a year!

I don't really think anyone can answer that question. 
Alot of people call it one, but they don't really give valid reasons IMO. Like we don't even have sufficient liquidity yet. Wait until the world order book from Qash goes up. Either way, if you think the tech is there, you know that this is going to replace the financial system and so this is still technically cheap. Gotta research and form your own opinion man.
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:42:54
Also the whitepaper isn't holy scripture. It's an open source community driven project. Clearly the majority of the community is happy with the current blocksize and layer 2. Those who aren't have forked and done there own thing. So you can kindly fuck off.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:17:30
Yes but then onwards you will pay lower fees due to segwit!!
@_date: 2019-11-12 20:22:40
Oh gotcha. At the moment, it's not quite useful for anything other that any arithmetic problems and some base algebra. It can also do root finding for any polynomials. My goal was to just get something out there. My next iteration will be fully featured, math speaking. So it will be able to do calculus, linear algebra, etc. Which is when I myself and probably you, would have used it in university. ex: you're in 1st year calculus and you're learning integrals. You have a problem set to do but you're not quite catching the concept. You try yourself and compare your answer with Obilisk. You got it wrong. You wanna see where you went wrong. You either figure it out or pay for the step by step.
@_date: 2019-11-12 20:14:57
Currently, it's "free" to use as it's running on testnet Bitcoin while my main node syncs. If you use htlc.me, you can quickly create a funded and ready to go testnet lighting wallet and try out the website for yourself :)
@_date: 2019-11-12 20:48:47
Thank you :)
@_date: 2019-11-12 05:05:59
Agreed. Which is what I'm working towards. However, as it stands if you take an equation that both Obilisk and Wolfram Alpha can do say finding the roots of a polynomial, they both do it for free. To see the step by step with Wolfram alpha, you have to be a subscribed member giving away your privacy and subscribing for something you might use a handful of times.
With Obilisk, you can use pay as you go for the step by step pseudonymously using Bitcoin and Lightning Network!
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:29:43
I appreciate the feedback. I get where you're coming from that education should be free. There were many times during my university degree I thought this. But here's my stance. I'm offering an app that without payment works exactly like the competitor. So if you wanna verify the accuracy of Obilisk you can. And instead of forcing you to pay a monthly fee for a service you may only use a handful of times, you can pay 0.25$  to see a solution.  
I am however taking what you're saying into account and I will open-source my code. All of it. If a broke student really wants to, they could download the software and just run it locally for free. Or if you appreciate the convenience of using the website, you can!
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:29:17
I think you pretty much get general idea. It's also a valuable technology because of its potential in other use cases other than being a crypto currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:48:59
Well I believe in the layer 2 solution: lightning network. And I think the community does two as Segwit was adopted. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:49:40
Man I don’t get why you’re getting hate for this, this is hilarious Hahaha

Because bitcoin cash is claiming to be bitcoin. They themselves don’t want both to coexist

@_date: 2017-11-12 07:58:45
That’s a gross over exaggeration of upfront costs to be a profitable miner for bitcoin. There are large upfront costs but not 20 mil$. But either way, that just proves the point that mining has become centralized. And we need to talk about solutions.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:27:17
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:23:15
I’m ok with a blocksize increase when there’s actual community consensus. Not from a backdoor deal signed by a few people claiming to represent us all. And you’re right, even with layer 2 solutions, we probably will need a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:52:45
They do, it’s called DDoS
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:37:54
Thank you so much! I may have this piece featured on a news style website soon. I’ll share the link here if I do!
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:47:00
I understand that increasing blocksize will lower fees and increase speed TEMPORARILY. But all that does it make a block harder to mine giving more power to big miners. Which is clearly the issue here. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:43:39
Idk why people are in such a rush to make bitcoin faster? Nearly nobody uses it as a means for exchange YET. But that’s not for years. It is a pain to pay such high fees and to wait long times during peek periods of usage but this is not the majority of the time. Most people HODL. To me it’s so clear that this is an attack on bitcoin, trying to hijack the network. Segwit and lightning takes power and money away from miners and they don’t like that.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:25:21
I can’t imagine how devastated I would be had I been in the same situation as you. It must be terrible. But maybe this could help you. You could become a voice for people joining the Crypto community by sharing your story and telling them they need to own their private keys and keep money off of exchanges. I read somewhere that GDAX holds 10% of the worlds bitcoin... that’s nuts! If they shut down sooo many people would lose their crypto.
Also, it’s not too late my friend. Western institutional money is only going to start pouring in in 2018. We are still in the infancy of Crypto and blockchain. Bitcoin is still cheap. You probably won’t get those 76 bitcoin back but I’m positive if you buy now you can make some more profit! Get back in the game!
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:39:33
I don’t really think they can considering Bcashers like roger ver claim to be Bitcoin. They want the to take the brand and essentially fire the core devs. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:16:38
YeH there are wallets being developed like ZAP.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:53:41
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:37:31
What do you mean? We were all against the NYA from the start. Segwit has community consensus. Segwit was proposed by community and accepted by community. Bcash was created by a small group who were opposed. NYA was announced to double segwit chain. Which people have been against from the beggining and why the hardfork was dropped.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:10:38
Regulation has started. And it will expand. But I’m not sure it will be as regulated as some might think. Especially when you consider bitcoin to be a protocol for an internet of value. Much like Http is a protocol for hyper text and the internet of information. Think of how people try to regulate the internet yet fail. There’s VPN’s and torrenting. We are pirating content which is illegal yet we still do it and get away with. I don’t see regulations working necessarily. I agree that we need to define standards and practices as a community though. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:51:41
What is blockstream?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:33:16
Yeah maybe! Do you think people are seeing that? Would explain the price pump for BTG.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:13:55
Man I hope you’re right. I hope that bitcoin as is, is infailable and resistant to centralization and attacks like these. But seeing such massive market manipulation like we did today.. it’s hard to believe. Billions created and lost in minutes. That’s fucked
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:54:57
Man there was always people against NYA. The NO2X camp just grew larger and louder as more and more people were learning about what was happening. That’s the thing with backdoor deals, the details came out slowly over time and people started realizing what it really meant. And people started having more and more conversations about what blocksize increases really do. Don’t forget that anyone can be a dev for bitcoin. Anybody can write code and propose a change to the network. Core devs aren’t CEO’s.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:45:40
Don’t you think that a global council would be a form of centralization though? I think the community is the council. Maybe what we need is a better way to vote on proposals for the network. Instead of node signaling, maybe voting could be part of wallets?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:15:52
The thing is, what smaller everyday transactions are you referring too? What do you use bitcoin for yourself?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:04:45
No I don’t want him/her to be banned. We need to have these discussions. This isn’t dems vs republicans. Bitcoin is supposed to be the answer to 2008. To big banks. Having miners control the network makes them the new big banks.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:40:11
Sorry! I know it was quite long but I think it’s worth the read :)

What we need to do is continue using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:17:13
Posted the same article on r/BTC. Interesting to see what both sides think of it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:16:45
It definitely would. Do you think it would be enough time for LN though? If we could reach proper consensus, I wouldn’t argue. But when a backdoor deal like NYA claims to be community consensus, then I don’t think it’s really a good solution. Short term or long term.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:05:15
This was incredibly well written man! Good read!
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:26:59
Absolutely! I have money on an exchange waiting for the right moment!
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:59:12
What I'm saying is, if there's global thermonuclear war, we are all fucked. Who cares about money then? We're all dead. And if the sun flares and causes all electronics to short, then bitcoin, the internet and everything doesn't work so again who cares about  money then?

The idea is to have bitcoin replace fiat, and that would mean wide spread adoption. So if nobody ever uses bitcoin as a means to transact for any kind of good or service, then bitcoin will basically remain a speculative asset. Where as if it is used by people to buy a pizza or whatnot, it will gain more adoption and the potential gains are greater. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:39:42
Lol i wish I could see your face when cryptos are globally adopted, and these little bugs we are experiencing in the infancy of this “cute social experiment” are sorted out. Either be an early adopter and profit from this or forever regret this day.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:30:31
I think that's the least of your concerns in both scenarios...

@_date: 2017-10-30 02:52:08
Yeah so what I’m saying is if everybody has this mindset, would big news like I mentioned in OP cause a drastic crash today? Seems like we’re all strong believers in cryptos.

@_date: 2017-10-25 16:14:13
Ohhhhh ok. Any idea how the atm sends instantly? Is this a feature of the atm’s wallet or is this inherent to bitcoin transactions? That they appear despite being unconfirmed?
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:55:01
I was thinking the exact same thing Hahahaha! Love how they use ripple to. But hey, of course they’re against bitcoin, they have so much to lose from it succeeding
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:06:18
So everytime a block is mined, a complex mathematical algorithm called a hash is solved. It's a unique digital finger print given to the block and it's based on the contents of the block (the transactions inside and the hash, or digital fingerprint of the previous block). So hash power is the capability of the network or of a node to create a hash fast. The more hash power, the faster the network or the node will be at creating it. And speed is relevant because the first person to create the hash is the one rewarded with bitcoin (incentive for mining). Hope this helps, and if anyone feels my info is wrong or misleading, feel free to correct me.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:13:58
Hmmm interesting. thank you for answering my questions.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:04:43
*Cough* CONFIRMATION BIAS *cough*
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:50:12
Exactly! And ideally, you wouldn’t spend all of your crypto holdings. You would only use tiny amounts. So like another user said, I’d also be thrilled if a pizza I Bought with BTC today was worth millions because that would mean I’m a billionaire.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:01:15
ASIC’s are specialized hardware made for mining crypto. Some Crypto’s are asic resistant through inefficient hash algorithms and by promising to fork if asics are ever developped. This allows anybody to use their GPU’s to mine for a profit, where as bitcoin now, takes a huge up front investment in order to make money from mining, thus centralizing mining.
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:45:29
Yeah I’m gonna disagree with the guy. Sure maybe regular employees of central banks are good, but the heads at the federal reserve, the regular big bankers who knew what they were doing when they were trading mortgage backed securities, who knew it would fuck people over, they’re not good. 
I can agree that it does suck to spend a deflationary currency atm. You buy a pizza with 0.003 BTC or w.e and turns out it could be worth thousands later, it sucks. But it’s also good! Because if you spent 0.003 BTC which I assume is a small fraction of your total bag, and that amount is worth thousands, then it also means you’re rich! Not only that, at a certain point, if it becomes globally adopted, I don’t think that it’s value will dramatically increase like it has been for the last 8 years. I believe it’ll come to a point where most people will have adopted BTC and it’s value will stabilize. It’ll increase because of loss of BTC but I also believe that smart people are working on solutions to losing your keys and whatnot. If I make any sense here. And also at some point, won’t be stop pegging the value of BTC to fiat? It may very well come to a point where we feel comfortable enough to price things in BTC without comparing it to a dollar equivalent value. My two cents
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:02:27
If 99% of bitcoin users Hodled, then how would the price be so volatile? It would be completely stagnant if 99% of users didn't move their money around. No people are using bitcoin. They're trading on exchange sites, investing in ICOs and buying things from the few merchants who accept bitcoin as payment. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:06:28
So a short block time happened every time I used an atm? Just coincidence?
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:08:39
No, there aren’t many Crypto’s that are asic resistant. The most valued asic resistant coins are Vertcoin and BTG (once they properly list it on coinmarketcap)
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:06:38
They want to add EDA? So basically bitcoin cash with Segwit?! This isn’t a second attempt at taking over the bitcoin brand at all
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:48:14
Ok first off, having enabled Segwit, bitcoin has agreed on a scaling solution: the lightning network. It’s a matter of time before it’s ready to go. Follow the devs on twitter. Some exciting stuff is coming. 
And as for the B2X fork, it’s not necessarily the fork with the most hash power. Saying that means that you admit miners have control over the bitcoin network. Not the case. Miners are going to go where the money is regardless of political beliefs. Bitcoin core is keeping the name post fork, and so most people new to Crypto and who don’t understand hard forks or what not are not going to buy B2X. They’re going to buy BTC. More people are going to be transacting on BTC for obvious reasons and so there are more blocks to mine on that chain. I’m sure B2X will see its spikes but ultimately I strongly believe it will fail.
