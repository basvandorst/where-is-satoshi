We can't even secure Highway 1, if this was geopolitical - business decision as you suggest, this would have been so unprofitable in that sense from day 1 that you wouldn't need an Mba to figure that out. How can anyone secure anything in that country, and I use the term country sparingly.

The current blockchain is in the neighborhood of 1.2Gb, depending on your location, how far behind you are on updating, it can take up to 18 hours.

Inconvenient? A one time run of around 48 hours to catch up, and then it runs in the background. If you don't have the resources to run it all the time (167,000k after 23 day uptime here), it still only takes minutes to sync.
@_date: 2012-04-24 19:59:56
It would be nice, I'd kill for that or to integrate it into Mint.

I keep it simple, is it the fastest method? No. Does it work, yes. Since I don't trust a 3rd party to hold my coins anymore (other than Mt. Gox), here are my steps.
1) Download [official Client]( 0.7.1. Install, and then wait. The block chain is pretty massive and can take some days to catch up to real time.
2) Simultaneously, pick a payment processor that will accept your fiat AND the exchange of your choosing accepts. I use [Dwolla]( have done it since Aug 11, and even after the Mt. Gox transfers starting slowing down, I really find it hard to beat the $0.25 transfer fee. Caveat - The transfer from ACH -&gt; Dwolla -&gt; Exchange can run anywhere from 4-10 Business days. Don't want to wait that long, ok, not a problem. Find a service that will allow you to instantly transfer your money through some means like [BitInstant]( expect though your fee table to jump up for the trouble.
3) So you know have fiat at an exchange, i.e [Mt. Gox]( purchase your coins.
4) Withdraw said coins to your wallet address established by the official client. Rinse and repeat.
This is just an extreme summation of the possibilities that you can do to procure Bitcoins, more information can be found here - [Bitcoin Wiki - Buying Bitcoins](

I did I fresh install within a VM based off a Crucial M4 with 0.7.1, from install to ready to go it took just over 8 hours. If version 0.8.0 is as awesome as all the horns are being blasted, lead time from install to use will be marginal.

I bounced back to simplecoin from slush on the concept of maybe I'll get something, but in reality I should enjoy the time I'm not burning electricity like crazy.
@_date: 2011-12-25 16:00:09
I don't seem to run into that problem - Based out of the US, using my laptop on a German ISP, or I've used the Mobile app in Austria/Czech. Even when it was initially asked for over the summer, wasn't that big of a deal to provide the information.
@_date: 2011-07-26 23:15:58
I see an issue with someone purchasing your BTC's on the exchange with dwolla assets and then reversing it on you at a later point. This could be a problem.
@_date: 2011-08-04 01:33:19
I'm not seeing the issue with electricity. I ran a 6950 + 5830 for the month of July full tilt, 24/7. It's 110 degrees out here so my A/C is thumping away; my net electric bill for a house of 4 of us guys came out $6 higher. My rates stayed the same, I just don't see the additional 300 watts as a deal breaker. Turn off some lights when you aren't using them, don't watch as much TV on your big 'ol screen. 
TL;DR - IMO Electricity is only going to spike if you aren't used to leaving your computers/servers on 24/7, even if they are lazy and idling away.

Explaining it like you're 5.
1 - You sell me X bitcoin for paypal. X is a number.
2 - I tell paypal you never gave me said item.
3 - Paypal takes the money I gave you back, and then bans your account.
4 - You tell a grown up.
5 - I still win.

I wouldn't say its worth it at that price. Mine is generating 0.52 BTC/day at the current difficulty; much more than an upfront cost of 45 BTC and the break even time starts to slide well to the right.

LOL, no. I was selling computer parts here and Mitsubishi Evolution parts. I'm still in the 60 day holding period, and the only reason I know there is a 60 day hold is that I started calling them out out on twitter after receiving no responses back to my emails/calls.
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:19:52


Not necessarily. If you transfer stupid amounts (5k+) on a regular basis, expect the flags to start raising.


We are collectively shaking in our boots.


No, exchanges do NOT absorb this risk. You literally legally have to know and report every single person you sell BTC for $ to.
Those of you who got an ASIC are going to end up fined or in jail for doing so. You can't even cash out to meet your 100% ROI without commiting tax evasion
What are they going to do, run background checks on GPU purchases. "Hold on there Suzy, that new desktop you purchased has an AMD GPU. Where are your two forms of Identification?"
Once again, we are shaking in our boots.

I'm on track to break even at 117 days assuming a difficulty raise of 9.9% every 14 days.
I also have a stake in Avalon batch 3, so if that comes online in 60 days, I break even at 103 days on the combined purchases.
It's all about what you want to have in your back pocket. All of the BTC's I've spent have been profit from trading since sub $2 purchases.
@_date: 2013-05-25 18:19:41
Not true. So far since turning on my blade on May 9th I've returned 21% of my investment, and that's with the two difficulty changes that have happened already. Assuming 11% difficulty increase every change, I'm looking to break even mid July.
At 100 watts of power and 12.4 gh/s, I'm not complaining.
@_date: 2013-05-23 02:36:26
1% isn't that much for piece of mind.
@_date: 2013-04-30 00:26:46


Exactly. I have a couple hundred of BTC just sitting around, and this puts some to use rather than leaving spreads on Mt. Gox. 


I put a preorder in for BFL FPGA single last year in April, and in July got refunded. I learned my lesson: either it's in hand (which I will pay a premium for) or it's not, please come again when it is.
