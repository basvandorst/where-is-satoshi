BU centralize, Segwit descentralize.
Segwit is a important proyect. BU is a patch.
Segwit have future. BU no.

No, you need at least, 10% of total hash rate for to have posibilities of take a block and insert a transaction.

Raspberry Pi + Lan HDD?

First Segwit, and If later we need to increase the block size, since it is enlarged.
I think is the best option.

Finally core moves.
Is Spanish, we said: " Órdago a grande".
Now, we waiting the move of BU.

Make a node.

I think the problem is not the amount of the transactions, it is the size of the transactions.
If the transactions are very large, your CPU suffers. Luckily the size of the transactions is limited to 1MB.
I believe that when there is a lot of mempool, the miners take bigger transactions because they give more benefits.

No!!! A block of 2-4MB  was blow up the ma-am node.

Jhian is confusing Bitcoin with ether

No, you arent under attack, but the bitcoin blockchain is a full performance.
And atention!!!! If the Blockchain size was 2MB, you node was crash!!!
Your node is still alive because the block size is 1mb !!!!
If they increase the size of block, only expensive machines and very powerful, can work. Hence the centralization

the major risks of bitcoins right now is a Bug in 2MB+Segwit software.
