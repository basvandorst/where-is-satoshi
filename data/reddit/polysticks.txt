Like I said, what I was proposing was compliant with all UK laws and regulations. You can tout the money laundering aspect all you like as the banks tried to do however when you press them on the details they shut down since they know they don't have a leg to stand on. The term money laundering is used as liberally by banks as terrorism is by governments to get their way.

A transactional banking account with no loan or overdraft facilities. Exactly the same as the ones they offer other businesses.

On an individual business level sure, but when the banking system as a whole is acting in concert with each other to actively prevent a legitimate industry from growing there's arguably serious anti-competitive practices at play which go against the whole idea of a free market economy. This is especially more apparent when you consider 97% of the UK's money supply is electronic in the hands of banks.

This was in the UK.

Bullshit. I've approached more banks than I care to remember with a Bitcoin business that is fully compliant with all laws and regulations in my country and yet they say no.

First of all I wasn't looking for a loan at all, I had plenty of money to start the business.
And secondly you can't launch a large business at all without a bank account when you're dealing with large amounts of fiat currency.

Is this a joke? The laws and regulations which govern banking are publicly known, providing you don't break them and take all reasonable measures to ensure you abide by them Banks can't legitimately use these as reasons not to give you an account.
When being turned down for bank accounts I routinely pushed hard for a specific reason and law/regulation that I wouldn't be abiding by. In all instances I was given the generic AML bullshit despite that I'd be taking many more AML precautions than businesses they already work with and that I'd be using the services of companies whose sole job is to ensure AML+KYC compliance. I never got a detailed explanation as to why this wasn't good enough because they know it was, they just politely told me to fuck off.

Does Transferwise work with Kraken?

Wasn't there a service just like this a couple months ago that got shut down by Amazon? If Amazon are allowing this then great but can we get some sort of official confirmation from them?

Considering how UK banks have been towards Bitcoin thus far I wouldn't be surprised if their account got suspended very shortly. They've only managed to get it going in the first place because Barclays don't know they are related to Bitcoin.
And yeah, misleading title for sure.

First direct is a division of HSBC Bank plc and HSBC don't like Bitcoin. HSBC aren't even letting other banks they do clearing for to work with Bitcoin.
