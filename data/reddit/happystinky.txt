Yeah, they were only down for a few minutes... what's strange is they said they were over their daily sell limit... that was when the prices plummeted $40 to a new all time low for the last 90-days... then when the prices went back up to $520, they reopened. It's one thing if the site posts honest restrictions on buying but don't post false statements. Clearly they weren't over their daily sell limit.... just sayin'.

BIG news from high-authority sites like NYT result in big price swings in next day trades... because the news isn't just bouncing around Reddit threads... it's landing in living rooms across the country and around the world... With all the media authority blasting this story all over the news tonight, tomorrow is sure to be a crazy day for BTC across the charts. Sub $200 is likely IMO.

It never fails.... condescending, American-hating, troll reveals himself in a reddit thread. Imagine that. You're predictable and your jealousy smells of weakness and self-pity.

This wasn't a support request.... it was a comment on the state of the bitcoin marketplace as a whole. Coinbase's ability to sell bitcoin during price drops is relevant and obviously people are interested so ffs yourself.

Ever seen this before? Was just about to buy a few BTC, refreshed my screen and got this message: 
"Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Friday Feb 28, 2014 at 04:47PM PST after your funds have arrived."
Who wants to buy bitcoin blind based on Friday's prices? 
One more thing to weaken confidence in the exchanges' ability to support the Bitcoin community.

I dunno.... from everything I've studied about Bitcoin trading and what effects the prices, most of the big shifts in price happen the day after the big media picks up the stories and blasts them out to the masses. I haven't seen too many stories pick up this much mainstream media coverage like this story has tonight.

Pessimist about Bitcoin? Reporting on the state of Bitcoin and predicting price fluctuations doesn't make me a pessimist. A realist, maybe. And, sorry I don't have time to spend browsing through 100 different news sources from around the World to make sure that they all report the same news. I have a life. I think a simple Google search for "bitcoin" should suffice just fine. Blame them for not reporting your local news results. Now stop your trolling. I know you'd like to blame all your problems on Americans but by the sound of it I think you're problems run deeper than that.
