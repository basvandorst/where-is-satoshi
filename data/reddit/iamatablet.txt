Lol, bitgo has no obligations.do anything for bitfinex customers.   There is no.relationship between bitgo and a bitfinex user.

That's a whooooooole other topic. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:14:27
I don't disagree.

Has there been any indication  that this was a databreach?
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:30:22
Yes, I'm pretty sure.  Although I reserve final judgment until a layer date.
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:16:27
I disagree on the second part.  Somewhat agree on the first.  Multisig did its job.   But the user never had their own key, so I don't know why anyone would trust that more than any other exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:59:00
What exactly has bitfinex said?  Both companies are doing exactly what they are suupposed to do... Investigating and working with the authorities.
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:29:40
What. The fuck.  That is the most retarded statement I've read this week.
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:54:45
No startup, is going to have a morality or ethics clause.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:16:27
Fuck off.  You do it better then. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:49:02
The protocol is to ensure your security capabilities meet the demand of your clients, not that you protect people from themselves.  
This is still a pretty egregious fuck up, but if bitfinex chose to remove security features for the sake of ease of use, no company would or should stop them.

Bitgo can only verify the policies established by the organization.  If the org has shitty policies, then bitgo can warn them, but ultimately has to enforce shitty policies.

You still have to compromise the server with multisig, it's not enough to just happen accross the private keys or score a db dump.

Are you in the US?
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:53:05
I agree and disagree with you.
On your first point, if bitgo did what was asked of them.  They are 100% not liable.  The customer IS always right less they become not your customer. Would you prefer bitfinex use blockchainn.info?
On your second point about HK, absolutely agree.  Someone needs to step and mitigate this disaster before it gets any worse.

Lol, the entire article mentions bitcoin once....


That's it, there is no rushing to buy bitcoin or even access to bitcoin that could warrant the title in OPs post.
@_date: 2015-05-24 03:12:30
10k a month is very reasonable.    BTC.com sold to GAW for 1.1m..  Okcoin is getting a better ranking site for half the cost and no large upfront investment.    It is, by all means, an exceptional price.
@_date: 2015-05-24 03:02:11
And we all know the broad and conflated definition is the preferred definition of the fine folks of the US Justice Department.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:11:42
I'm not sure where the line is, but it might be the dollar amount involved or that you are exchanging your stored credit for something with a cash value.   Ie. You can't use a quarter to play an arcade game, but you can also buy coffee with cash.  
@_date: 2015-05-24 10:58:52
I just showed you the EXACT statute and you say I'm  misreading it?
When is structuring not money laundering?
@_date: 2015-05-06 03:20:47
OFAC is a US regulatory acronym, Office of Foreign Asset Control.  Every financial institution needs to verify its customers against various OFAC watch lists to ensure they are not doing business with bad actors engaged in money laundering, terrorism, or other shady stuff.  
@_date: 2015-05-24 03:00:21
Money laundering is actually defined as the illegal introduction of funds into the monetary system. It doesn't make a distinction on how the funds are obtained.  They do this so it covers tax evasion as well as illicit funds.

Liuberty X partnered with one company that has partnerships with one other company that has thousands of retail locations.
Those retail locations have no idea who LibertyX is or what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2015-05-06 04:28:45
Paypal already does that and I didn't say it wasn't a big market, I just ripple was a small fish.
@_date: 2015-05-24 09:43:23
Its a technique used to launder money.   Legal or otherwise.
18 USC 1956 talks about tax evasion, violations of the internal revenue code, or attempts to evade financial reporting.
@_date: 2015-05-24 07:43:22
@_date: 2015-05-06 03:23:46
It depends on how its done, probably yes.   Not necessarily under mo ey transmission but under prepaid access
@_date: 2015-05-06 02:58:31
The notice also makes it clear that Ripple is UScompany and is responsible reporting ALL transactions.
Ripple is officially a less used version of paypal.
@_date: 2015-05-06 03:25:00
No thats different.  Arcades sell tokens for game play.  Those token have no cash value and can't be redeemed for goods at any point.   Ie, its not a currency or stored value so its not regulated.
@_date: 2016-03-06 19:52:36
It depends on exactly what problem the banks are trying to solve.  Dropbox for finance already exists, it's called Dropbox.  Or Box or any of the enterprise networking storage options.

@_date: 2015-05-24 03:08:52
Have you seen the contract?  What makes you think its one sided?  It seems very reasonable to me.  
Edit, I see your response to roger RE the cancelation policy, I agree that is unfavorable to okcoin, it should be a 5 year contract so long as okcoin pays the minimum 10k/month.

Biying that much bitcoin, you need to go to an actual broker or exchange.   If its a one time deal, you can talk to cumberland, gensis, or gemini.  
If its going to be ongoing try bitstamp or itbit.

Only by way of reputation.  Last I heard Bitfinex didn't take a loss, it was spread out over the customers.
Meaning the customers are the victims, and bitfinex would have to convince all of them not to press charges.

Spoken like someone who has never run a business before..or really ever tried anything at all for that matter.
Anytime you try something new,  there are hiccups.  Nothing is ever flawless.   The companies only responsibility is to deliver or refund.  Bashing a company on social media only distracts from that goal.

Show me one company that decided to "rethink their strategy".  Companies who make bad decisions do so understanding the cost and they stick to their strategy.  
Backlash isn't the " nature of the beast". That's asinine.  Customers have a civil responsibility to work things out with a business before going to the internet, especially when dealing with new, small companies in emerging tech spaces.
