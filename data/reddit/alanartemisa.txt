I think he means that the rich have invested in mining, so they own a non-trivial amount of BTC, but I'm not sure because of his vague questions vOv
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:50:23
Yeah, you have a good point. Banks (or governments) could decide to go with public transactions where accountability would be needed though. But yeah, it still allows them to keep transactions anonymous, which they'd probably do.
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:17:12
_Especially_ when network usage increases! Even better would be a simple webpage for it!
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:15:52
Fees would be.... High. Like insanely high. $100k Bitcoin would see a lot more transactions than current $12k Bitcoin. However, with layers being built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain (like LN) there would also be some downward pressure on transactions (you would still pay for a car with an on-chain transaction, but you probably wouldn't pay for a coffee or even a lunch on-chain). 
Also, sending 1 BTC is the same as sending 1000 BTC or sending 0.000001 BTC when it comes to on-chain fees.
Long story short; I have literally no idea.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:24:10
Assuming coinmarketcap and google are correct:
$215.7 billion worth of Bitcoin in circulation
7.53 billion people in the world
215.7 / 7.53 = $28.61, so about that.
That'd be the mean. However, more correct would be looking at the median person (middle value), which would currently have about nothing in crypto. According to [this website]( the mean ADDRESS would hold somewhere between 1 and 10 mBTC, so somewhere between $12 and $120. But I'd expect most people to use multiple addresses, so I'd expect the average person who has *some* BTC to be somewhere between $120 and $1200. I might be biased though since I'm in that category.
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:04:21
When nobody cares it won't immediately go down when somebody sells, so I'd say this is good :)
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:53:20
Yeah, exactly. And although I seriously dislike the way BCH is being marketed, the idea of increasing block sizes isn't completely insane either when adoption goes up drastically.
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:09:16
HODLing is a lot easier when the price is going up :) I saw the load of buys happening a little late and sold some mBTC for a lower price than I could've gotten, but it happens vOv
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:29:47
Exactly! Oh well, shows that HODLing is still king for getting rich!
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:48:11
I know how you feel, checking it all the time as well. Just need a little dip now so my buy order fills and I'll be happy :D
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:28:28
Exactly. They don't want to have everything out in the open. Which is not entirely bad, I'd rather keep my private keys as well. But yeah, there's indeed several reasons why they wouldn't adopt blockchain or more transparency.

You can manually set the fee, it's somewhere in the settings! Electrum doesn't raise/drop fees fast enough to keep up with recent fees imo.

Had a sell limit order at 9.8k and a close position below that at 9.6 or so. Well... RIP me trying to accumulate more BTC :')
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:25:08
As someone told me a few days ago: If you try to trade short-term you're going to get wrecked. I didn't believe him. I got wrecked lol. Lost some BTC by selling, then buying a little higher. My gains up till then were like half the amount I would've made had I held the BTC, so keep that in mind.

Hey, so... I have a possibly stupid question. Are you from the USA? Because in the Netherlands (where I'm from) we don't have the idea/feeling the government is out to get us (and luckily we don't have any reason to afaik)
And if you're from the US: why do you think there's so much distrust towards the government? It's something I find really intriguing, because there seem to be such big differences between countries!
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:48:08
Yeah, that's fair. Invested amount is bound to be much lower of course, but the market cap represents the current *value* of Bitcoin, which currently puts the average BTC holdings for everyone in the world to ~$28, although I suppose that the average investment would be WAY lower as you said. Good point!
@_date: 2019-07-11 13:11:11


Wait... What the fuck, are they even *allowed* to do that? EDIT: This seems a gross violation of your right to privacy, quoting amendment 4:

-500 to -5000000? :(
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:17:26
People bet that Bitcoin would drop in value, but the price went up, so they had to buy Bitcoin to cover their position.
(Short = "I'll sell this to you at the current price in the future", if the price drops you'll turn a profit  
Long = "I'll buy this from you at the current price in the future", if the price goes up you'll make money)
Keep in mind that's a very simplistic explanation and doesn't cover most of it, people being forced to liquidate their shorts means they just lost a lot of money betting against BTC
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:53:48
Why do we have to be so difficult? :(
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:06:25
Like... Storing parts of the key in different locations? (decentralization?)
You could also (like others suggested) create your own hardware wallet. It's a good point though.
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:56:26
Would showing the [licenses]( that Coinbase has as a money transmitter help? You'd need to cross-reference them with the relevant authority, but maybe it'd make her less hesitant?
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:08:47
Well, 1s/byte is fine assuming a 200 byte transaction, even if the price hits $1m/BTC, because you'd be looking at about $2 per tx :) Fees would go up when blocks are full though, that would have more effect on the paid fees I suppose.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:51:57
I don't expect the price will go up to 0.5 BTC, but the problem with higher Bitcoin adoption is that there's a limit to the amount of on-chain transactions that can be made per second. 
Right now the absolute max speed seems to be up to 20 transactions per second assuming 100% segwit adoption ([link]( only checked one link after a google search, so take it with a grain of salt). Apparently Visa handles some 1700 transactions per second currently (also single source, [link]( here).
That means for Bitcoin to become mainstream adopted we'd need to see a serious increase in how many transactions per second Bitcoin could handle. The Lightning Network will help take over a lot of smaller transactions, maybe even up to several hundred dollars. I'm also assuming more improvements will be made to Bitcoin that will lower the cost of transactions.
I don't think transactions will ever be expensive as 0.1 BTC per tx, so you should be fine. If that would ever happen on the main chain people would move to sidechains and the price of transactions would drop again. I can't predict the future though (wish I could, I bought some BTC this morning for 11550 EUR/BTC, it's now at 10750 :( ), so take all I said with a grain (or full shaker) of salt.

@_date: 2019-07-10 23:14:55
Best way to truly safeguard your assets is building your own hardware, writing your own software or using something open-source that has been audited by lots of specialists. Anything else would have the risk of malicious actors.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:59:56
If you get more BTC by mining than by buying it's worth it though.
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:32:18
Wish it was. I set out a trading strategy for myself that would've made more money, the only problem is that I can't be awake 24/7 to execute it. Luckily my Raspberry Pi can be, so I'll be working on a little app that I can use to create stop loss/take profit orders at the right moments, buying back at a lower price. It's essentially a fun project for my summer since I study IT :)
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:17:32
You're saying Bitcoin will become centralised (or at least run the risk of becoming centralised). You mentioned that "(...) in a few years, it will take an investment of hundreds of terabytes of storage per year to store the entire transaction history.", however, the Bitcoin blockchain has been growing (and was designed to grow) at a more-or-less linear rate. 
At the rate the blockchain has been growing (just onder 160 MB/day, data taken from the past 255 days because that's where my cursor landed on the graph that showed the blockchain size over time) you'd need another 4800+ days, or 13 YEARS to get to just ONE TB of blockchain data to store. 
I strongly believe that it'll be trivial to store 1TB of data 13 years in the future. Hell, doing these calculations make me wanna set up my own node with 1TB of storage now. It'll be able to run for over 12 years anyways.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:55:21
Exactly. Writing your own software would require you to become a computing science and cryptography expert, building your own hardware would require you to become an electrical engineer and so forth. 
An open-source solution would be the best since it is open for auditing and improvement, making it way more secure.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:14:44
I'm quite tempted to buy something, it looks awesome!
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:56:13
People had to hand over their gold so the Fed could print more money. Iirc you were allowed to keep a small amount of gold, buy anything above a certain weight had to be given to the state.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:56:55
If you are not regularly transfering your BTC it is not worth it transferring over to Segwit. If you're accumulating more you could set up a second wallet with Segwit though.
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:40:58
You're right of course. The BTC I started with a few days ago is worth 7.97% more now, while I only made 4.18% profit. It's fun to try to time buys and sells correctly though. Apart from the small amount of BTC I trade with I also have some BTC in my personal wallet that I'm aiming to grow slowly by buying some each month.
I consider messing around on an exchange more of a fun activity with some of my "for fun" spending money than something I'm going to make money off.  
I'm looking into building a small app for myself that'll automatically create stop loss/take profit orders as well, which would be nice since it'll allow me to improve my programming skills (I study software engineering) and mess around some more (instead of placing a limit order and waking up to the price having gone 2% over it I was thinking about having the app delete limit sell orders when the price goes up really quickly (like when shorts are eliminated) and using a take profit when the price settles at a new level instead. Or using a stop loss at a certain percentage below the peak. I'm not sure yet)
Wew... That was a wall of text. Anyways, tl;dr: I'm messing around on an exchange mainly for fun and out of interest, I am terrible at it and am aware of this fact.
@_date: 2019-07-11 07:22:25
I wouldn't know since I'm on Android, a quick google search got me [a few options]( from another reddit thread though!
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:46:10
Eh, depends, I sold near the end of the spike and am now waiting for the price to go down again so I can get more BTC :D
EDIT: To expand on that, I'm bullish on Bitcoin, but that won't stop me from trading on price swings :)
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:36:41
Yeah, adding leverage to that makes the potential profit and loss a lot bigger. I *almost* feel sorry for these people if they went with high leverage. *Almost.*
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:01:15
It all depends on how much of a cash reserve/BTC reserve they have. If I would run a mining operation I'd prefer holding my crypto as long as possible when I'm longterm bullish on the price. If your financial reserve is large enough you can keep going through the "valleys of death" where smaller miners have to stop running.
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:11:35
Well, you're right about that!
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:11:51

Exactly, which is hilarious if you ask me
@_date: 2019-07-11 07:26:18
They might not have included support for segwit addresses yet, which is kinda weird imo. It doesn't make things difficult, most wallet applications should allow you to make non-segwit addresses. Addresses starting with a 3 can be segwit addresses, addresses starting with bc1 are definetely segwit addresses, I'd assume hardware wallets/other cold wallets could hold the keys to non-segwit addresses.
I wouldn't know for sure though, since it's not my area of expertise, I don't own any hardware wallets and I only know a little bit about how Bitcoin works. I'm a lot better at speculating \^\^
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:45:13
So, after reading a few comments; 
- Yeah, some things don't work well (no PayPal (for good reasons!), updating very old versions of the software is hard (which is bad. Like really bad.), also, there is no web/mobile interface). Join the community to ensure it gets better. 
A decentralised system is way more difficult to set up well than a centralised system, but it is way more resilient and better at adapting to change (see Bitcoin itself) than anything that is centralised. Any web/mobile clients would provide single points of failure that would hurt its decentralised status. OTOH, making it simple to create web and mobile clients would help a lot as well. As far as I know a lot of smart people are working on this, so the best thing you could do is provide input so they know what they should spend their time on.

Both ways of buying bitcoin are valid, I'd say the *reason* for buying bitcoin for both ways of buying are different though:
- Buying when the price goes up: As an investment to make some quick money, preferably with low risk.
- Buying when the price goes down: These are the people who believe in bitcoin and consider the low price a great deal. If the price drops even lower the deal is even better!
Both strategies are valid if you ask me, one is safer (imagine the price dropping to 0, RIP everyone's BTC portfolio) while the other has potentially larger profits. Both reasonings are logically sound, one doesn't assume bitcoin will stick around forever and increase a lot in value soon though.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:44:10
Wait, lemme sell first, then post it! MOAR BITCOIN FOR ME!
@_date: 2019-11-18 17:42:55
It has some intrinsic value in that it looks pretty and has some useful properties beside the reasons why it was used as a medium of exchange. However, as a medium of exchange bitcoin does tick all the boxes of "good currency"
@_date: 2019-11-26 21:58:58
I wouldn't say it's a *great* use case for Bitcoin, but it's an interesting thing to think about. (there's no need to link these tokens to BTC, because it'd require value being put into backing the token instead of improving the Public Goods. The value of these tokens should be based on their scarcity, not on linking it to another store of value)  
In the whitepaper an example is given on how to issue tokens in education (divide a number of coins equal to the percentage of high school students that graduated that year to these graduated students). (can't issue it to the teachers because of the conflict of interests). How would this work for other Public Goods though? (Think about law enforcement, healthcare, national defense, public parks, how would you issue tokens for those?)
@_date: 2019-11-26 22:03:12
Still gotta wait six months for the 0.20 release. Good thing people downvoted him though, I guess they'll be the source of the free Bitcoins!
@_date: 2019-11-26 09:50:03
Haven't done this myself, but a word of advice: don't reuse the private key in that script for actual BTC, since we all know it now ;)
@_date: 2019-11-18 17:52:53
Cool! What were the costs for setting this up?
@_date: 2019-11-26 09:59:55
For real though, you could buy small amounts of BTC every week or month, these small amounts will stack up to become a large amount.
@_date: 2019-03-03 22:52:36
Operating costs of the node as well (even though those are low and constant)
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:22:37
Lightning works fine right now as far as I'm aware. Only question is if scaling it up to billions of users would work.
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:57:54
I'd like a nice red candle now, sold some after what I thought was a peak, buying back in now would be at a 5+% loss :/
@_date: 2019-11-27 00:15:52
How is Lightning questionable? From what I gathered Neutrino isn't working well yet, but the node I set up yesterday and today seems to be working just fine (only testnet for now, gotta stack some more sats before I use some on mainnet)
@_date: 2019-11-29 13:41:05
It's beautiful.
@_date: 2019-11-27 00:25:21
Other people have already given a ton of advice, my advice would be looking into setting up a full node on something like a raspberry pi. You'll need a raspberry pi (3 seems to be good enough), a 500 GB external hd and the cables to connect the rpi to your router + keep it powered.  
You can also turn it into a lightning network node (allowing you to transact over the lightning network). If you're interested I'll look up the guide I used over the past few days and link it to you!
@_date: 2019-11-25 22:02:18
Too bad we can't pay with BTC ;) Looks interesting though!

Huh, that looks interesting! Trying to figure out how to read the market is always fun if you ask me!
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:17:19
As people have said, we'd need to know where you got the BTC. If you bought it on coinbase or another place that holds your BTC for you it could still be there. You might want to look for a confirmation mail or something from around that time, it might allow you to recover the lost funds. There's still a good chance it's all gone though
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:04:08
The lnd implementation of neutrino is very much in beta with multiple app-breaking bugs in it from what I gathered. Best bet would be setting up your own lightning node and connecting to it with Zap or something similar.
@_date: 2019-11-26 09:45:46
Generally speaking; you don't.
@_date: 2019-11-27 13:26:03

@_date: 2019-11-27 00:19:24
I'd like to point out bitcoin core hasn't had a full release yet either (as in no v1.0).  
But yeah, it'll probably take a while before lnd or any of the other implementations will be ready for a full release.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:06:54
I agree that running your own node is the best option. However, not everyone will run their own node. Connecting to random nodes (should probably connect to multiple random nodes) is probably safer in terms of privacy than using data from a specific third party, no?

As an IT major who did a minor in IT management: They're overused buzzwords. Yes, each of these terms has meaning, but most people who use these terms don't even know what exactly they convey.
Reminds me of a "blockchain workshop" I attended. No work was done, instead the guy was bragging about how much he knew about blockchain technology (he wasn't into IT that much, more of a business/sales person, yes, it was in his presentation).  
tl;dr I've learned that the higher the number of buzzwords used by people, the less they usually have to say.
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:17:09
What do you want to use that blockchain for? What would you be tracking?
@_date: 2019-10-25 08:43:23
Are you only realising this now? ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:33:17
Uhhhm... Nice explanation, but what is stopping people from making changes to the Bitcoin protocol to make it quantum secure?
@_date: 2019-08-13 10:18:29
Can confirm, I have a decent(ish) trading strategy which would've turned me a profit, but I'd need to use that strategy in a bot to actually make it work (I can't monitor the market 24/7). Right now I've lost a fair amount of EUR / BTC because of price hikes when I wasn't around (say you set a buy and set a close position a little higher, I had it happen several times that prices spiked way above my close price and stayed there for quite a while, or you get a drop just after buying in, that shit happens and on the exchange I use you cannot set both a stop-loss and limit order price at the same time, I'm working on a bot that'll be able to do it for me though)
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:04:38
It would leave the control to the government and banks though. Too bad they have a bad track record.
@_date: 2019-10-03 16:58:35
I'm just sitting here hoping for another dip, sold some mbtc a few days ago, bad timing :(
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:12:42
Yeah, this is what OP should do. Then find the keys and get them in a hardware wallet, preferably with a backup in a bank vault.
@_date: 2019-08-13 11:11:40
Basically, you buy at x EUR or USD, then sell at either a certain % below the next peak or at a certain % loss (stop-loss). Then you buy back in at a price below the sell price (% above the lowest point since the sell moment) or at a certain % above your sell price (pretty much a FOMO stop-loss).  
You might want to tweak these values a bit depending on your fees and on how much you want to risk. Also, keep in mind I only tested it on paper for a three or four day period, during which it worked quite well.
I was planning on letting it "pretend" to have the orders up to simulate the profitability for a while before risking any BTC on it, and even then it'd only be a part of what I have. Although I buy into the "don't risk what you cannot afford to lose" I still don't want to risk it needlessly \^\^
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:01:04
I just wrote a small webpage that allows me to enter the amount of BTC I have and the price I paid for it in EUR, then it calculates the current value and if my investment has gone up or down. Can't do real time due to API restrictions, but I just let it reload every 30 seconds :')
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:22:17
I used a way lower fee two days ago, cost me just $3.30 or so. Pretty sure the fastest transaction might cost $6.50, but if you're not in a hurry you can just lower the reward...
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:58:32
I bought the dip. 24 hours and 8 hours ago. I'll HODL for a bit, thanks :')
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:57:27
Transfers during working days maybe?
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:41:18
Thing is, you could probably set up a mesh network of mobile phones in a city or village, but connecting said network to other networks could be quite hard. Thus ISP's would still be needed, charging fees per (kilo/mega/giga)byte transferred over their connections that'd connect separate networks.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:28:32
If you want fast, low-value transactions you use the Lightning Network. If you want to send larger amounts a small fee shouldn't be a problem. If fees go up a lot it might become annoying, but for now I'm not worried. More people should switch to segwit vOv
For the transaction I did $3.30 was fine (less than 1%). When fees get a lot higher it might cause issues though.
@_date: 2019-12-21 19:23:22
As much as I hate to say it, they do have somewhat of a point. Somewhere else here I saw just over 50 TPS floating around (in a nearly perfectly optimized block with current tech).
50 TPS = ~4.3m TPD = ~1.6b TPY. There were 7.5 billion people in the world in 2017. That's about 0.2 on-chain transactions per year per person. Even if we'd move to a system where everybody is on LN you'd take 5 years just to open a channel for everyone. _Without doing anything else. With optimized blocks._
Luckily we still have some time to improve bitcoin and prepare it for the future though, there's lots of bright people working on it, but it'll take a while. Bcash is full of shit, but sure, they have more tx's in their blocks. Too bad (for them) nobody wants to trust them. Maybe they shouldn't have been practically scamming people.
@_date: 2019-12-16 11:18:07
It can be confusing indeed. Where are you from? There are probably people who can point you in the right direction.

@_date: 2019-12-05 21:56:20
So what I learned from reading a few reviews: not much, I wouldn't use it. If you're okay with selling your private information you could do it.
@_date: 2019-12-21 17:03:10
I agree. If you look at the number of transactions that can approximately be done per block and thus per day/week/month it'll be nigh-impossible to get the whole (or half, or developed) world onto lightning. Progress is still being made on making transactions smaller, but at some point we'll either need a hard fork or you'll need to use lightning channels pretty much forever since it's so expensive to open one.
On the other hand, this could be a place for banks in the bitcoin ecosystem. They could open a $/€ 1000, 10000 or more equivalent channel of BTC to somebody, routing their income to them and sometimes exchanging off-chain balance for on-chain balance. Only problem for them is that lightning doesn't allow fractional reserve banking, so they'll actually have to create value to earn money.
@_date: 2019-12-05 02:58:31

Same here, glad I found out though! Updating my testnet node now!
EDIT: Done! Took only five minutes as well :)
@_date: 2019-12-07 00:36:48
I was about to go to bed and then I read this question. Well damnit. Time for some napkin math.
Okay, let's say it's early January 2045. We've just had the 9th halvening. 20,958,984 bitcoin have been mined so far. The block reward is now less than 0.1 BTC.
If a single BTC is worth $150,000 of todays USD we're looking at a market cap of 3,143,847,600,000 USD. That's 3 trillion, 143 billion and so on. While a serious amount it's still not much compared to the current-day US GDP (~19.4 trillion USD in 2017). Anyways, I digress.
Hundreds of millions worth of BTC being dumped on the market wouldn't have too much of an effect on the BTC price, but imagine three million (not a specific reason for three, it just sounded better than one) BTC being dumped in one go. That's worth $450 billion, about 15% of the total supply.  
That would definetely hurt the faith people have in BTC, but I suppose prices would slowly climb back up again, assuming we've managed to create new addresses that are QC-safe. The fundamental rules of Bitcoin haven't changed at that point, there will still be at most 21 million of them ever, but now the lost BTC will be added back.
Right now it seems BTC is relatively safe against quantum computing (as far as I've managed to find), but if anyone figures out a way to attack it it would probably take years for the hardware to be built for it. And I'm pretty sure we'll manage to work something out to counter that before they're done building.
*And something random to add to this: If one BTC is worth $150000 (2019) USD in 2045 fees per block should be about .5 BTC per block if the hashrate remains constant to be as valuable as the current rewards. With no updates to Bitcoin and only the smallest possible segwit transactions ([max 12195 in a block]( you'd pay 0.000041 BTC, or $6 for a transaction. Assuming the number of transactions stays as low as it is now.*
Okay, I'm going to get some sleep now. Damnit.
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:50:56

I'm in the process of setting up my own full node on a RPi at the moment, got everything (including the Lightning Network) working on testnet and I'm now working on a web interface that I can use to manage the node.  
Probably going to set up a UPS for it as well before I'm switching to mainnet though!
Anyways, setting up a RPi full node is extremely good to learn more about bitcoin. I've had quite a lot of fun (and some frustration, made a typo in one of the configuration files and couldn't figure out why something didn't work) setting it up!
@_date: 2019-12-02 08:27:17
So I just woke up, so might not be entirely awake, but why use a centralised currency? The beauty of BTC is that we don't have a single point of failure. Hell, Coinbase could collapse tomorrow (taking about 1 million coins out if circulation) and we'd still continue going. What would happen if the party running KBC or -insert random altcoin here- goes bankrupt/is censored?
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:50:05

@_date: 2019-12-05 02:32:28
You're right, but I bet you're stronger than me when it comes to keeping emotion out of trading (I had a buy order that would've been filled this morning, took it down and replaced it with a higher one so it'd get filled). Trading can be *very* profitable, you just need to remain rational, which is *REALLY* hard for human beings.  
I still turned a profit though, could've potentially made 30-50% more profit, but profit is profit.

As promised I'd take a look, but then I realised that we have [this link]( in the sidebar. (the "how to buy bitcoins worldwide" link). You can enter your country and preferred payment method in there and you'll get a list of exchanges/brokers that accept that payment method in your country.

@_date: 2019-12-01 14:33:01
Yeah, both have their pros and cons. I'd prefer a non-custodial wallet in the form of an app that in default mode only opens a channel to the exchange of the app developers. Then an advanced mode where you can open channels with other nodes.

@_date: 2019-12-21 19:35:47
Huh, how though? For having a lightning channel you still need a bitcoin txid as far as I know.
@_date: 2019-12-28 09:14:52
As could running your own node, since you can verify if your payments haven't been messed with.
As for lightning: you'll be in charge of your own money, without needing to trust anyone else (which you need with a custodial or neutrino wallet)
@_date: 2019-12-16 11:36:27
I'll go look into it for you in a little bit! From what I remember some people on this subreddit have posted lists of where to buy bitcoin per country, not sure though.

@_date: 2019-12-07 00:59:42

@_date: 2019-12-09 00:49:28
It's evening again and I should get some sleep, but I promised I'd get back to this post, so here I am!
As you (validly) said about Lightning: Every channel needs two transactions, an open and a close. If fees are high this could make it expensive to open a channel. However, the company you work for could open a channel to you with the balance you'd make in more than a month of time (or pay somebody else to do that), then you could (for instance) have a channel worth $1000 with only part of the balance on your side after your first paycheck through this system. It'd also allow for some scaling up and for you to save up some money to move off-chain at a later time.
This would be not ideal for privacy (since either your employer or a company working with them can see the channel balance (on the other hand, banks can also do this)), but can be counteracted by opening your own channel after saving up some funds if you'd like to or paying another channel provider for opening a channel with you.
As for the centralisation: in the lightning network there is a higher degree of anonymity, nodes don't know whose payment request they are routing (there's a few ways to determine this though, but also ways to counteract that), so the censorship resistance remains. The single point of failure remains though.  
If currently an exchange is hacked or goes offline a LOT of bitcoin can be lost to its customers. With the Lightning Network your counterparty can just close the channel and retrieve their funds since every node holds their own keys.  
Having the network become reliant on these large nodes can (and will) be counteracted by the group of "medium"-sized nodes. This would be nodes that connect to several large nodes and some other medium nodes. It's very similar to the way the internet is structured, so if a connection drops data (in this case payments) is routed around that connection. 
As for the profitability of mining going too low due to the lightning network: There's still a VERY low number of max on-chain BTC transactions per time period, if one billion people would try to open a lightning channel it'd take *ages* for all these transactions to clear, so fees would go through the roof. I'm expecting both bitcoin and its on-chain fees to go up a lot more by 2045 than what was mentioned in the OP. I'm looking forward to finding out!
@_date: 2019-12-25 19:57:02
I believe people have floated around opennode (opennode.com) as a decent payment processor for BTC payments. Would take less effort than setting up btcpayserver. However, setting up btcpayserver puts yourself in charge of your money, making you more independent.
@_date: 2019-12-29 13:46:58
M-out-of-n multisig and using multiple services would fix this, no?
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:57:10
The things that are possible with the Lightning Network, the fact that there's a limited supply of it, because it cannot be stopped by boundaries, and so on.
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:49:32
I'd try to badly explain it (and I will below), but I suppose Lightning Labs has a better simple [explanation]( After reading this, imagine if not only "Alice" and "Bob" are involved, but Bob also has a channel with "Charlie". Now Alice can send BTC to Charlie by sending BTC to Bob if he proves he has sent BTC to Charlie. You can theoretically scale this up *ad infinitum*.
So.. The Lightning Network consists of nodes (entities with a private key) and channels (2-signature wallets shared between two nodes). Nodes that share a channel always have a pre-signed transaction by the other party dividing up the funds in it as has been agreed upon. The only thing they need to do is sign the transaction themselves and broadcast it to the regular Bitcoin network to get it mined and incorporated into the blockchain.  
Now, say Alice and Bob have a channel open between them. They have both put in 10 BTC, so their channel has a total capacity of 20 BTC. If Alice wants to pay Bob 1 BTC she creates a new transaction dividing up the funds in their channel, one wherein Bob receives 11 BTC and Alice receives 9. She sends this to Bob and Bob returns the same transaction, only signed by himself. Bob and Alice can continually change how they divide the channel balance, allowing them to make infinite transactions at the cost of only two transactions (opening and closing the channel).  
The cool things is that if Bob has a channel open to Charlie Alice can pay Charlie by paying Bob if he can prove he has paid Charlie. And you can scale this up a lot more, allowing for payments to anyone anywhere, at the speed that it takes the participating nodes to confirm the new transactions.
So... That's kind of how it works. For any of the more knowledgeable people who has spotted horrible mistakes: Please correct me where I'm wrong!
@_date: 2019-12-09 00:17:26
I'd suggest presenting your information in a clearer (and cleaner) manner, because it looks kinda similar to [this]( right now.

End users could also use a light LN wallet, like LND with Neutrino (when Neutrino is ready), they'd only ever need one (or a few) channel(s) to your mentioned exchanges anyway.

@_date: 2019-12-21 19:13:23
Why go for atomic swaps (which are on-chain if my google-fu didn't betray me and I've read enough of the explanation) if you can send BTC over lightning? What would it solve?
It should be possible to do a swap between BTC and LTC lightning network though, using the same principle that is used for the multi-hop payments on LN.
I'm not a bitcoin expert though, so feel free to ignore me (and _please_ correct me if I'm wrong, I like learning more about bitcoin!)

Just pointing out that objectively the narrative of "they're coming here to rape our daughters" is incorrect.
Don't have the numbers on gun violence, but (anecdotal) some guy in this thread mentioned that the violence doesn't seem to be organized, which might point to society as a whole becoming more violent. You could argue it's because of immigrants, you could probably also argue it is because of polarization in society (the "us vs them" reasoning that I've noticed more and more over recent years).

I talked about this with a guy who works in finance, he said they'll probably never make interest rates negative for consumers because it would have the effect of people storing their money themselves. Mainly because it'd destroy them (when everyone closes their accounts it'd turn out they don't have enough money to do so).
@_date: 2019-09-13 18:43:04
Looks like they do, but their site makes it look easy to withdraw BTC (with them actually paying the transaction fees). You're still paying for them to handle your incoming transactions though.

@_date: 2019-09-13 18:45:34
Agreed, because banks are so important for people to go about their lives they should at least have something in place for cases like OP so they can get access to their money again quickly. Even if it'd be with harsh limits until business hours.
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:21:42
I'd say the best thing you (and anyone who agrees with you, including me) can do is upvoting helpful comments and downvoting the shitty comments you mentioned. If they're especially toxic you could consider reporting them even.
@_date: 2019-09-09 08:24:49
Have you read the article he linked? It clearly mentions that apparently the definition of rape was expanded in '05, causing the first "spike" and that there was no rise in reported rape cases by strangers, but rather a rise in cases against people the victim knew.   
Although the ethnicity of victims and criminals isn't tracked it would seem that there is no direct correlation. This is further supported by comparing numbers from communities that have taken in more refugees to communities that have barely taken in refugees. There was again no significant difference.   
Sure, you can go blame people you do not know nor understand, but that's just the easy way out. There's enough bad things in the world already, don't add more hate please. Or keep your political comments on-topic/contain them to a subreddit that wants them.
