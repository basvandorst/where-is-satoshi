Calories (where this ATM is) is supposed to start accepting Bitcoin soon.

Looked on his website and did not see a donation address. Anyone know what address to send to?

My 7 GH/s BFL is for sale too. With this bump in difficulty my latest calculations show I'm earning the equivalent of $0.17/day but power is costing $0.18/day. 
Time to shut down the mining rig.
I could have probably squeezed by another couple weeks if my Raspberry Pi hadn't died... My laptop + miner uses about 50W from the wall.

Doesn't sound like it but I'm not sure. 
Speaking of Android apps..
I like Bitcoinium for Android. 
Not sure if it's okay or not but so far haven't heard anything scary about it.

I paid for a 5 GH/s BFL miner in April then paid for the 2 GH/s upgrade. The total was $388 with shipping. I received it in November. It is running great but I doubt it will ever pay for itself... other than the fact that the Bitcoins mined will likely appreciate. 
It is fun to play around with mining but definitely not getting rich.

Yes I understand. What I meant was that it might not be a loss in the end. There are often better ways to invest/profit.

You don't have to buy 1 Bitcoin. You can buy $10 worth (0.01 BTC) at the current ~$1000/BTC value.

36 days?  Are you sure? I calculated more like 5-8 months but it's hard to predict the difficulty increase.

I totally get what you are saying but I do not agree with your definition of a loss. 
It is still possible for me to make back the equivalent of what I put into my mining hardware (including power) in terms of dollars, although I do not plan on cashing out in dollars. I'm in no way saying it was the best use of my money but it might not be much different than leaving that money in my bank account. You can't call it a loss just because investment X would have made more than investment Y. 
Just to make sure we don't go in circles. I completely understand what you are saying. I will even break it down into my financial details. 
Coincidentally the price of BTC on April 4, 2013 (BFL 5GH/s purchase) and May 24, 2013 (2GH/s upgrade purchase) was $133/BTC. So basically I spent the equivalent of 2.92 BTC. Today that would be worth about $2370. Since I received my BFL hardware I have mined about 0.287 BTC or approx $233 at today's value. So yes it is pretty obvious I would be better off had I purchased BTC rather than mining hardware. I think it's probable that the value of the BTC I mine with this hardware will be worth more than $388 when I finally pull the plug on it. Currently the electricity is costing about $0.10/day so it will be a while before I have to pull the plug.
There is also a fun factor. I like playing with technology so I find mining to be fun and interesting. It also supports the whole Bitcoin system. I'm honestly a bit afraid of what might happen if the big guys are the only ones mining, which seems to be the way things are going.

If we're requesting charts...
3D pie chart please?

Aren't the dividend payments from profit ASICMINER is making from mining/selling hardware? The purchasing of shares allows ASICMINER to buy/create mining hardware.  That's how I understand it.

By your definition no form of currency can be secure unless it is totally inaccessible. 
I propose a new currency called PoopoopeepeeCoins that will be 100% safe because there is no way to steal, store, buy, sell, transact, counterfit, hack or use PoopoopeepeeCoins. This currency will also have no value at all.
