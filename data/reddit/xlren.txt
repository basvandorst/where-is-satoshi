Be careful Falun gong is a sect they do a ton of disinformation after the gov did a crackdown on them. Not to say Chinese gov sent many believers to jail and probably some are killed in the process but falun gong is a sect it’s not to be trusted.

It’s sad, the behavior of the mass is easily manipulated. 2nd generation ago, the grand parents of the protestors wanted a HK to return to communist China but were heavily repressed, today their grand sons suddenly become nostalgic and wanted HK to be colonized again, they are all manipulated by invisible hands.

I'm afraid your mind is illogic, if some cryptos are scam would you say that cryptos are scams? If some people in a community are doing bad things would you say the whole community is bad? Your are a lazy thinker
