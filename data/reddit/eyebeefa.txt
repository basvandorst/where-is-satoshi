Wow, you are not smart 
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:56:42
Did you even bother watching the video?
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:29:45
Says who?
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:38:56
A lot of smoke around LN lately. I’d be surprised if it’s not being seriously used by the end of this year.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:21:31
Less activity probably.
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:55:07
Oh, so you have to first deposit bitcoin in a wallet before you buy anything you say? Shocking.
Stay in school kid.

@_date: 2018-01-07 04:49:14
Good question. Wondered the same thing about the futures.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:44:14
Where are the Jan 26 CME shorts at?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:47
Well it’s coming whether you like it or not.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:11:53
Is this going to actually happen anytime soon?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:04:40
What do you guys think will happen to the price once the gov steps in to regulate?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:48:24
People are becoming educated on other coins. BTC needs to improve, plain and simple.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:17:22
I sold it all for Bitcoin at the dip.
Sorry, if you don’t think crypto markets need to be regulated I dunno what to tell you. Way too much insider trading and pump and dumps going on.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:13:14
BCash’s technology is better than Bitcoin, no arguing that. Bitcoin just has the name brand so got investment purposes it’s better.....for now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:05
Or BCH takes over, we’ll see
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:15:13
People are starting to get educated on other alts. Bitcoin needs to improve or it will fall to the wayside, plain and simple 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:56:27
Bitcoin needs to get its act together or it will be replaced. It’s pretty simple.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:44:31
It won’t be banned. I think it will be regulated like any other investment and will become a new asset class. Not sure if it will fall under commodities, currencies or something entirely else. Once regulated ETFs will follow soon thereafter. I think the price actually may increase, but what are the downsides to regulation?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:00
This is why we need regulation. Complete clusterfuck.
@_date: 2018-05-24 23:27:55
Sooner we get regulation the better
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:40:27
Well yeah if you're looking to retire by 40, but of course you could also go broke.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:02:14
Well, if you are concentrated in bitcoin and crypto, you do probably want to sell some and diversify. Investing 101.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:12:10
I'll continue to hold both, but if you can't see the problem then I dunno what to tell you. The whole premise with the btc runup was these enhancements would lead to lower fees and faster transactions. Uh hello?
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:42:49
A pullback has to happen soon, this is just not realistic.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:58:26
I'll believe it when I see it
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:49:29
This all sounds like a bitcoin crash is bound to happen soon. Glad I didn't sell my BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:35:53
Does anyone know why it's getting pumped so hard right now?  Does anyone care?
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:39:26
It will crash hard no doubt, anyone with any sense knows this. Don't think this sub cares too much though because the majority of people here have very limited investment knowledge.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:29:05
It will never replace fiat. The government will never let it.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:31:59
You guys are cute thinking the government couldn’t shut the whole thing down in a blink of an eye.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:20:14
The fees need to be fixed, plain and simple. Unfortunately, it’ll probably take an alt taking a run at btc until something happens.
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:56:04
This thing is going deep, probably sub 1k
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:03:38
No they won't 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:34:35
Fair assessment
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:34:35
Fair assessment

I know Exodus is working on it. All wallets and exchanges will be Segwit by year end. I think by summer all the big boys will be upgraded. Then the focus turns to LN. Development and testing takes time, but it’s coming.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:23:55
Lmao @ bch losers
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:51:02
It'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:41:08
I'll take the blue pill tbh
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:30:13
This is a good thing. Legitimize coinbase and this will push bitcoin and alts further mainstream.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:13:42
I don't get what the rush is. If the developers don't think it's ready, it's not ready. Why not take the time so everyone feels comfortable?
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:36:32
It will go sub 1k
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:34:02
So are people just pretending there are no fork problems or what?
