I think only flawed claim is that he is comparing after IPO prices of companies with Bitcoin. Which is not fair because when companies do IPO they already pretty big so there is no way they can grow in order of magnitude. But at that time Bitcoin was nothing, there were no major exchanges, no knowledge, just hobbyist. In order to make this fair you need to compare this with Apple when Steve Jobs and Wozniak were working at a garage. And if you invest at that time you could make profit comparable to Bitcoin. example:

Very less likely. Google researchers claimed that AMD, Intel and ARM processors affected by this flaw. Intel accepted, but an AMD engineer announced that AMD is not vulnerable.

I may look like advertising for altcoin but please read everything before deciding. Maximally decentralized and maximally secure cryptocurrency already exists, which is Monero. Maximally decentralized because it uses ASIC resistant hashing algorithm, so everyone runs nodes and contributes to network hashpower. Chinese miners can not be monopoly because of they have early access to next generation ASIC miners, drive up mining difficulty with those and make previous generation ASIC miners obsolete, not profitable and kick competitors out of network. 
It is maximally secure because even ledger does not know who is the sender, who is the recipient and what is the amount. Looks like magic but it is real, only sender and recipient knows (explanation [here]( If you combine it with Tor, which makes almost impossible to track your IP address. This is the maximum security you can get at this time, for maybe even next ten years.
 
But that does not mean they will be the winner, because they will not. They have the same scaling problem which comes from blockchain and decentralization itself, they will have high transaction fees like Bitcoin if they ever go mainstream and get same transaction volume as Bitcoin. 
p.s. I honestly do believe that if Satoshi was with us today, he would be proud of what Monero project put over his ideas.

He is a impressive speaker and he has a fair argument but it is not truly correct. Scaling is a big pain on Distributed blockchain systems, it is not a big problem on more centralized solutions. Because if you try to scale distributed blockchains you put heavy-load on everyone who runs full node, but some altcoins do not try to achieve that anyway, so they can scale easily.

Oh, I thought you were asking for external causes. Internal causes are really simple, it is supply and demand.

If price drops more, more people will try to sell, and so on.

Usually commissions eat the profit, otherwise everyone would do that. It is more profitable if you have bank accounts in multiple countries and make buy/sell in different countries, since gap is more wider in different countries. But it is risky, price can change while you transfer, you can end up losing money. If you are a whale you can keep big amount of BTC/cash in multiple exchanges, so every time gap is profitable you can do buy/sell without transfer, and once in a while you can balance your funds among exchanges/countries. This is impossible with small money, profit is infinitesimal.

I think most people around this sub does not really understand macro level of economics. Certain level of inflation is actually a good thing, inflation pushes people to either invest or spend. Because waiting money is dead money, waiting money can not help anyone, because money is nothing but numbers.

I do not thing targeting any valid wallet would make it any easier, because after calculating a private key, you need to encrypt a message and then try to decrypt it with every possible public wallet keys to understand which wallet it belongs. or you need to sign a transaction message with every private key you calculated and send it to Bitcoin network, both options will slow the process exponentially.
That being said, You can use social engineering, like using the words in star wars opening crawl will more likely to hit a valid wallet. But then you are not the only one who tries those, and if words are so easy to guess those wallets probably already empty or do not have any significant balance.

Opening or closing channel requires transactions to be broadcasted to Bitcoin network. Bitcoin network supports below 10tx per second.

I think value of gold comes from it's uniqueness. Tomorrow bitcoin may crash and we may start using another altcoin, because there is nothing unique about Bitcoin. Another coin may offer everything Bitcoin offers, or maybe even better things. But another element can not offer what gold offers, because gold is gold, and it is very less likely to we will discover or create another gold like element anytime soon. 
So even though there are limited use cases both Bitcoin and Gold, Gold have been with us for very long time and will be with us very long time, for example if one day if we decide to go to mars, i am sure gold will be used in some kind of device in that rover. For example there is gold in every iPhone.
So combine these uniqueness of gold with scarcity, you may understand the value of it. Also it is shiny and looks good.

No just invest in public transportation, implement ramp meters, encourage carpooling, etc. There are many solutions you can find but widening exists roads is not one of them, because if you solve the problem using bigger block size when next time that problem happens you will do that again, so there is no end. 
Wide roads takes more area, also bigger block size takes bigger space in storage, which blocks blockchain to be distributed.

Yes it will never hit zero but for example after hitting $1k, it went back to $200, and it took 3 years to recover from there. It may happen again or maybe not, it can go down to $15k and never hit $20k in another year. How you are going to pay back that 5k difference then? If it is your money, no problem just forget about that money and continue your life until it goes back to 20k+. But you can not HODL with borrowed money. That is why people always tell you "do not invest money you can not afford to loose" because true HODL philosophy requires not needing that money ever, until it reaches very top.

There are 489 contributors to this project, and 21 maintainers. So if maintainers place a backdoor, any of those almost 500 people can notice it. Maintainer also does not mean manager or owner, they are just contributors who spend a lot of time on this code and knows it very well, so when other people contribute they do quality check, correct mistakes etc. They do not have super powers, they can not decide a roadmap and ignore the community. And if community is not happy with their decisions, they are always free to fork it, some people were not happy about smaller blocksizes so they forked BCH. I can not imagine better democracy than that.

This is not true, exchanges does not sell you their coins. Some other user like you sells you the coin. They just keep the money because some other user may want to sell their btc and cash out. Their income model is fees, they take a cut from every deposit/withdrawal.

People who invest in altcoins also invest in Bitcoins, so they cash out all together. Simply trust to cryptocurrencies declining.

Nope, mining pools are not charity they would never pick low fee transaction over high fee transaction.
And I do not think there is a way to enforce them to do that with specification changes, it is free market, highest bid gets the slot.

To be honest not anytime soon, cryptocurrencies not that convenient yet. And people are very conformist. We do not like current system but we are also so lazy.

Initially people mined themselves, it was not that hard to mine, even CPU was enough. That was the main point actually. IMHO satoshi was good with cryptography and math stuff but he was not that good with software and hardware. So he could not foresee his initial vision will be destroyed by greedy ASIC miners, otherwise I am sure he would pick ASIC resistant hashing algorithm.

If they use separate wallets they need to pay a lot of transaction fees when coins change hand inside exchange. And there would no easy way to implement cold storage.
So it will be very less likely to any exchange implement something like that.

pure speculation, no context.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:22:38
Fee is not the only problem, there is also confirmation time for transactions
You may consider using another coin at your store because "Bitcoin is a currency" thing dead long time ago, Bitcoin is failed as a currency (there is some hope after lightning networks though). Now people use Bitcoin as a digital gold and other cryptocurrencies as a commodity. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:16:43
Increasing blocksize will cause Bitcoin network to produce much more data, which will increase the required storage space and bandwith to operate a full node. So only fraction of the network will be able to operate full node over time. And we do not want that, we want distributed network. Solution is solving scalability issues adding a layer on top of exist network. In that way Layer 1 can stay distributed and Layer 2 can be decentralized with some big nodes. But in my humble opinion both approaches not enough to scale Bitcoin. In the end we will end up either not usable network or centralized network. I don't believe distributed and usable network can be coexists.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:37:05
It used to be like that, now even with investment you can not compete with big pools. They have access to next generation ASICs, many months before you. They are making more profit with same electricity costs so they can afford more ASICs. More ASICs bring more ASICs like snowball. And with Lightning Network they will operate central hubs with big funds and increase their profit. Until they become monopoly.

People care about Bitcoin because of the shit tho
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:00:52
I don't get it. How number of wallets or number of transactions can explain the price increase if price increase mainly causes those, people opening wallets because they bought bitcoin, more transactions because people bought bitcoin.

No but I also do not believe that any of the first generation coins will be still exists in five years.

To be honest I never used automatic services like Coinbase, I always used exchanges which you can add buy or sell order at any price. So isn't Coinbase just automatically buys you Bitcoin from lowest sell order that another user entered?

Or price goes down and the one who sold at final ath buys a ferrari with profit while hodlers still refreshing the charts hoping it may rise again. Nobody knows the future neither you or me, both scenarios are equally possible, the only not possible scenario is two of them buying ferrari together, this is a zero-sum game someone has to pay for the ferrari, everyone can not win and get a ferrari.

I think cryptocurrencies like viral videos/memes right now. It was Bitcoin's turn and people consumed it. There is not much to talk about it left, so it is Ripple's turn now. But no worries even after this hype Bitcoin can stay strong since it has strong community. But don't expect 5k-10k jumps a day anytime soon.

Yes, I understand blockchain is for big transactions and paycheck is a big transaction for majority of people, if they can not get their paycheck on blockchain, maybe blockchain is not the ideal solution? Let's say you can only settle on blockchain once a year to make Bitcoin handle 500 million people, does it sound right? And what would stop people from closing channels for 10$ fee then 12$ fee and goes on, Bitcoin network is unusable again. You should understand that getting a paycheck and putting into LN is more than perfect scenario, if you say that people maybe should get their paycheck using LN, you are pushing really too hard to make it work.

Actually you are not exchanging anything, when you create a wallet you get a private key, which gives you privilege to sign messages as owner of that wallet, When you spend your bitcoin you are basically signing a message saying "Hey I am owner of wallet X and, i gave Y amount of bitcoin to wallet Z", Everyone has copy of blockchain and blockchain is basically consist of messages like yours, in order to know who has bitcoin and who hasn't, you need to start from first block and do all the math.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:15:05
If intelligence agencies get information from big exchanges it is not really hard to trace transactions back, there are some scientists working on graph simplification methods to make sense of complex structures like blockchain, because there are some services mixes bitcoin from different people and in theory make it harder to trace back. These scientists trying to understand those kind of stuff.
ex: 
But despite Bitcoin, Monero uses one time wallet addresses and ring signatures to secure spending. It is much harder to trace comparing to Bitcoin, that is why most black markets nowadays accept Monero as well as Bitcoin.

Yes, diversifying portfolio is very basic and important principle of investing. People on subreddit will probably  suggest "buy/buy more/invest every dollar you have/borrow money and buy more/sell your home and buy more" but this is wrong, even though you know that bitcoin will reach millions in future you can never know when you will need liquid money. Bitcoin can crash back to 3-4k and stay there months or even years while you need cash, so when you sell you will lose money. So you should diversify your portfolio between high risk-high profit, low risk low profit investments.

Unfortunately bitcoin is no longer decentralized even without lightning network, most of the hashpower comes from couple of mining pools and most people use couple of exchange services. 5 biggest banks in USA control half of the market, but 5 biggest bitcoin exchanges control 80% market, and 5 biggest pool have 70% of the hashpower.

Yeah this is so not true, In order to buy Bitcoin you do bank transfer to exchange services or use credit cards, Nobody ever said I should find a local Bitcoin seller and meet on street to buy some Bitcoins.

Checking accounts of millennials getting empty so they have to convince their family and friends and help them to move their money to Bitcoin. Thanks for filling Chinese miner's pockets with your greed to get rich. History will remember this.

They do not have to target Bitcoin itself directly, they can target major exchanges instead. For example Bitcoin considered as "commodity" in US, if they do not recognize it as something, someone can sue an exchange company saying "I paid money but did not received anything in exchange" this will put exchange company in though position since how they are going to defend themselves using something not recognized by government and in the and their bank accounts may be get frozen. 
In totalitarian government like China you have more creative ways to block Bitcoin, you can directly block bitcoin network with Deep Packet Inspection.

Yes, I do not want to recommend specific service but there is something called "transaction accelerator" basically you pay them and they have agreements with mining pools so they prioritize your transaction.

I think market cap concept is faulty, bitcoin now worths around ~8900$ what this means is someone is willing to pay this amount for  single bitcoin, so people calculate market cap using 8900xTOTAL BITCOINS MINED. But not all bitcoins sold for 8900, there were times people bought pizza for 10.000 bitcoins, many people mined thousands and lost them, so there is absolutely no 140 billion in bitcoin economy, if everyone decides to sell now price will drop drastically and total cash out will nowhere near 140 billion.

Bitcoin itself is not a bubble, scheme, ponzi etc. But price increase after 3k shows all the symptoms of a bubble. A lot of new people who are not interested in technology itself buys bitcoin and hopes becoming rich soon. When bitcoin was &lt;100$ people invested in idea/technology and risked their money to support that eventually this technology got mature and adopted, and they made profit by supporting this technology. But nowadays price increases without a specific reason, mostly because hard fork speculations. If you believe in bitcoin and hope to see it used it everywhere in 3-10 years no it is not a bubble, if you want to be get rich in 3 months yes it is a bubble.
