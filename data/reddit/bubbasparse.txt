The author fails to understand that he can't define bitcoin or fit it in a nice little box because it's truly revolutionary. This is anything but the boring era of Bitcoin. We are near the beginning and have yet to bear the fruits from all the new startups and all the research/testing of things like the lighting network, side chains, instant txs with 99% probability, etc. How about the block size limit debate....boring?

People that bought 100 coins at $50, a $5000 value, now have roughly $80,000.  So you're saying those people should spend all of that money?  That seems irresponsible.

Coinbase is a relatively big company and they have regulators and LE watching them closely. They have to be strict if they want to continue doing business and become a big player in the payments space. I don't understand how people don't understand this. Use coinbase to buy Bitcoin (or circle) but don't use them for a day to day spending wallet and don't use them if you wish to stay anon. It's pretty simple.

It's so silly that apple allows this and not an app like coinbase.  From their POV they have to draw the line somewhere but the devs will continue to push closer and closer to the line until it's unrecognizable.   Their line in the sand becomes meaningless and just causes apple customers a minor inconvenience more than anything else.  I wish they would just man up and embrace it.

This doesn't make sense to me.  He is said that bitcoin would benefit from a physical good backing it, but why then would he want a credit card backed by bitcoin (aka nothing physical)?  I think he was referring to the mastercard network which is indeed valuable and what companies like bitpay are trying to replicate.  The whole metal backing bitcoin doesn't make sense to me either, are you exchanging bitcoin for metal?  Then the bitcoin isn't backed by metal, just used for exchange or value.

Sidebar: Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money.

As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

He was at the north american bitcoin conference in Miami in January and at the end of peoples speeches, he kept asking leading questions to indirectly promote his 'solution' to bitcoin volatility and currency risk (which turns out to be UltraCoin).  I could be wrong, but something seems off.

I've been thinking about this for a while. You could even go as far as having multisig to "decentralize" and have a 6 of 10 to send the funds. Also you could have side bets for over/unders for players,teams and betting on other games in your league. As long as someone takes the other side of the bet you wouldn't need a "bank".

Bloomberg LP plans to list bitcoin prices on its financial data terminals, a move that could give the volatile digital currency a stamp of respectability and spark interest in U.S.-based trading platforms.
According to a blog post on Bloomberg's corporate website, the more than 320,000 subscribers to the firm's terminals will now have access to bitcoin prices from Kraken and Coinbase, both of San Francisco. Kraken bills itself as a bitcoin exchange while Coinbase, which provides payment processing for merchants and digital wallets for individuals, functions more as a broker-dealer.
One person familiar with Bloomberg's decision said it was made in response to requests from hundreds of customers wanting access to bitcoin prices. The facility, which allows users to chart prices, has been in development since last year.
"While bitcoin and other virtual currency markets are still nascent, they represent an interesting intersection of finance and technology," wrote Tod Van Name, Bloomberg global head of fixed income, currencies and commodities in the blog post. "Given that Bloomberg sits squarely at that intersection, providing pricing for this underdeveloped market is a natural fit for us."
He added that the move reflects the firm's objective of bringing transparency to "all markets, even digital currencies."
Bloomberg competes with Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, in news and other areas. Dow Jones is owned by News Corp. NWSA +0.47%
In relaying prices from the two exchanges, Bloomberg's move doesn't enhance or standardize existing prices like a newly engineered index from multiple price feeds would. The financial data provider said its move didn't amount to an endorsement or guarantee of bitcoin and that customers wouldn't be able to trade the digital currency on a Bloomberg terminal.
Still, investors could welcome the news as a vote of confidence in bitcoin, which has seen its price halved since December following a string of negative developments.
Bloomberg terminals, a fixture on trading desks across Wall Street, are a key part of the trading infrastructure used by banks, hedge funds and other deep-pocketed professional investors, a group whose money could bring significantly more liquidity to bitcoin trading.
"On Wall Street, an investible asset class is considered to be something that's quoted on the Bloomberg terminal," says Barry Silbert, chief executive of SecondMarket Inc., which launched a bitcoin investment fund in September. He has predicted once Bloomberg quotes a bitcoin price it would open it the currency up to "substantial institutional investor interest."
The blog post hinted that more bitcoin products could be in the works, telling readers to "stay tuned for more." It wasn't clear whether a price index, trading functionality or some other enhancement was under consideration.
Bloomberg's decision to draw prices from Kraken and Coinbase could provide a boost to those firms, raising their profile among professional investors. For Kraken in particular, which like Coinbase and other U.S.-based bitcoin businesses has been busily gathering U.S. regulatory backing for its operation, it could help it compete with offshore exchanges such as Slovenia-based Bitstamp and Bulgaria-based BTC-e, currently the two biggest bitcoin exchanges.
Bloomberg's decision to publish bitcoin prices coincides with moves to develop high-tech, federally regulated exchanges that would cater to professional investors in the digital currency rather than the individuals who have comprised most of the trading volume until now. These include a new platform targeted at high-frequency trading firms launched by Atlas ATS in New York and Hong Kong, one from London-based Coinfloor, which claims to the first auditable bitcoin exchange, and a separate SecondMarket project to build an exchange for institutional investors.
Digital-currency enthusiasts on Wall Street and pro-bitcoin venture capitalists argue these new exchanges are needed to generate the kind of trading volumes that would smooth out bitcoin's price, whose volatility is seen as an impediment to its widespread adoption.
According to an index from news site Coindesk, bitcoin's price soared last year from $13.51 at the end of 2012 to an all-time high of $1,151.30 on Dec. 4. That was driven in part by increased adoption as businesses world-wide began accepting payments in the digital currency and as U.S. regulators signaled an unexpectedly accommodative stance toward the new technology.
But since then, the price has fallen sharply amid concerns over a crackdown in China, a hacking attack that briefly crippled the digital currency's core network, and the collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the dominant bitcoin exchange.

The thing that people are missing with this argument is that even if merchants benefit more than consumers during a commercial bitcoin transaction, bitcoin benefits the people in general much more than the existing systems. In  developed worlds big financial institutions and politicians control the economy for their own gain.  In developing countries most don't have access to banking and payment systems.  Bitcoin is open, available, free from terms and conditions, and outside the existing control of politician and financiers.

It was a very interesting talk and I appreciate all that Bernard Von Nothaus has done fighting for personal freedom and sound money.  But towards the end of his talk he mentioned that he thought Bitcoin would benefit if it were backed by gold or another physical good.  It seems to me, the fact that liberty dollars were backed by gold led to the ultimate failure when the US GOVT seized his gold and other metals.  If the liberty dollar's value came from its utility instead of a central backing, it would have been much harder for the government to shut down.

I hear that argument.  IMO options wouldn't be bad thing.  A real world example which caused me to think about it was that I owed my friend $20.  He wanted me to pay him back in bitcoin and it took several guess and checks to get the amount to get it as close to $20 as possible.  I found it somewhat inconvenient and a non-bitcoiner commented, "wow you can't even send him $20".

Bitcoin is about separation of money and State.  It's also about [hard currency]( but it's also much more than both of those.  It can bring financial inclusion to the unbanked/underbanked and provide transparency to closed door financial institutions.  It also will open up the idea of smart contracts and smart property.   It's an open network that allows people to build products and services on top of a global technology, similar to the internet.  The possibilities are literally endless.  Be careful though, if these things interest you, you may fall down the rabbit hole.  I fell down about 18 months ago and haven't looked back.

I don't see this boosting bitcoin until the sheep wake up and realize that the banks are taking advantage of them.  Most people currently don't care that they are receiving zero interest during times of inflation because the banks are "keeping their money safe".  Most law-abiding citizens also will not object to showing I.D for a large cash deposit.  Most will keep their money in typical banks, until the realize the precious position our banking system is in.  In the meantime, Bitcoin will continue to attract libertarian types and tech nerds.

Because if the government makes it illegal, a lot of the potential uses will be illegal, limiting the utility for people trying to act within the law.

The purpose of Chapter 15, and the Model Law on which it is based, is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with insolvency cases involving debtors, assets, claimants, and other parties of interest involving more than one country. This general purpose is realized through five objectives specified in the statute: (1) to promote cooperation between the United States courts and parties of interest and the courts and other competent authorities of foreign countries involved in cross-border insolvency cases; (2) to establish greater legal certainty for trade and investment; (3) to provide for the fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies that protects the interests of all creditors and other interested entities, including the debtor; (4) to afford protection and maximization of the value of the debtor's assets; and (5) to facilitate the rescue of financially troubled businesses, thereby protecting investment and preserving employment. 11 U.S.C. § 1501.

I don't think it's that simple.  There is no doubt that decentralized has it's advantages and that's clear to everyone here.  But think about the shit you see on facebook....It's my opinion that the bulk % of FB users couldn't care less about decentralization as long as it's easy to use and useful.

Valuing Coinbase at $400M means that the company is roughly 1/12th the value of total bitcoin "market cap".  Either Coinbase is hugely over valued or bitcoin is hugely undervalued.  I vote for the latter.

Coinbase is not really an exchange. It acts like a broker. They can goto multiple exchanges, although I think they mostly use bitstamp, and have access to more liquidity with its own customers. One of the reasons why it is quicker than most is that to buy coins, you need to link you bank account. Therefore when you want to sell, your bank account info is already on file and no extra info is needed.

regardless of your political views, it's not smart to have a law breaking individual on the board of the foundation whose purpose is to promote bitcoin to the masses (of which the majority are law-abiding citizens).  Fight all you want against laws that you feel are unjust but it's stupid to be the face of a movement while still being associated with SR.  Bitcoin has big things ahead and those associations will not help it succeed.  
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:26:34
I think a general thought is that in 10 or so years we might have a better consensus system than POW that wouldn't necessitate fees. We will see experiments with sidechains (or something similar) as a proof-of-burn to move to value to another chain with a new consensus model not based on POW (which requires fees or the subsidy to mine in order to not operate at a loss paying for electricity). 
@_date: 2014-05-16 11:29:25
Thank you.  I've been trying to express this for so long now.  Bitcoin is open in nature.  No one needs permission or approval to setup a (legal) service.  So even if you don't like the service or direction it's going, too bad.  Honey Badger don't care.  Build something, see if people will come.  It doesn't have to "fit in" to any ideology.

The password to initially login to your account is a 4 digit pin.  In settings you can add 2FA login and a "vault password" (normal characters/ password) which is needed to reach the insured coins.  You can also set it to require your "vault password" at login along with 2FA.  Seems pretty good to me.

Coinbase makes it very easy to buy bitcoin and store them on a wallet under coinbase's control.  Blockchain is not a place to buy bitcoins but a place to create a wallet that only you can control.  If you trust yourself to not lose/compromise a password, then blockchain wallets are theoretically more secure.

I am really glad to see this post.  These guys deserve more credit than gives them.  All the ridicule they receive seems childish. They are putting in the work to get bitcoin the recognition it deserves in the financial industry.  That is probably passé to say since most here are anti-big finance and think the powers that currently reign are bloated, inefficient, and crooked.  But some of us fail to see that bitcoin has the ability to help legacy finance become better.  As much as we may not like it, JP Morgan and alike aren't going anywhere (and even if they do others will replace them).  The Winklevoss twins are paving the road to "legitimize" bitcoin in the financial world.  I, for one, am really glad they are doing what they are doing.

The intent of putting the limit was clear - anti DOS measures


When those problems are all well understood, then it might make sense to have one giant hard fork for all time, so as to reduce the risk of having to have another hard fork.
Indeed, certain technologies like extension blocks or sidechains might make it possible to have opt-in upgrades without any hard fork.
So your in favor of the much more complicated sidechains rather than a simple blocksize increase? Sidechains are not fully understood either...should we only deploy them when ALL issues are FULLY understood? 


Willy nilly? This debate has been going on for years and there has been a lot of research that points to it being perfectly fine to increase the limit.

Luke, would you be opposed to raising to 2mb max block size in the event of a hardfork? It would take a lot of wind out of BU sails IMO. Also put in segwit, possibly CT would be interesting.

How do large blocks decrease fees? Miners always have the option to not include tx with zero-low fees. If anything larger blocks allow for more tx -&gt; more fees for miners -&gt; more incentive to secure the network -&gt; happy bitcoin.

So I got my beer from liquid.beer. Is it up the the asset issuer to create some sort of reference site so one can see all the details of the asset? I looked it up on the liquid explorer but there's not much info there as I am assuming it's as confidential asset. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:33:08
It's not either or. segwit should not be rushed and it should be implemented with a hard-fork that also increases the blocksize.

I'm a fan of the show, can't get enough of the content. I'd like to hear you guys acknowledge that, along with sex drugs and rock &amp; roll, bitcoin can also be useful for capital flight and being an uncorrelated asset for those in situations where there may not be many other options to store value. I know you know that but sometimes you argue that it's is ONLY good for drugs, sexworkers, etc. Many more "mainstream" people around the world are underserved by their government currency.

I was just having a similar conversation with some friends. They think I'm crazy to be upset that in God we trust is on money and displayed in courtrooms.

Maybe I'm the crazy one...

I happen to agree with Stephen Pair in his previous article:
"The Bitcoin block size limit that Satoshi set back in 2010 was a stop gap measure intended to prevent a trivial denial of service attack. It was not intended to create an arbitrary and artificial scarcity for space in the block chain. At 1mb, this limit was well above the market demand for transaction volume at the time and allowed a proper transaction fee market to develop.
Miners already have plenty of disincentive for including transactions in a block. Each additional transaction included in a block increases the risk that the block might be orphaned. Therefore, miners will prefer to only include transactions that provide enough fee revenue to offset the increased orphan risk.
Today, the demand for transactions is bumping up against this artificial limit and is impairing the proper functioning of the Bitcoin network. As a result of this artificial scarcity, miners are being forced to only include transactions with artificially high fees. Eventually, Bitcoin transactions will be priced out of the market and alternative cryptocurrencies (or perhaps a fork of the Bitcoin block chain) will take market share. The transaction fee market is alive and well. If Bitcoin fails to deliver a product people want at a price they find attractive, there are many other options." 
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:19:57
Theoretically it's possible to change the supply by soft-forking extension/auxiliary blocks. Non-updated nodes would not notice.

Roger is clearly out of his league in this discussion. I think he began to realize that he's the one holding back bitcoin for political reasons, not the other way around. He must step up and endorse segwit or lose the respect he has left.

Reply from Matt Corallo: 


discussed. Though some general things were thrown out, they were not
extensively discussed nor agreed to. I personally think 2-4 is "in
range", though 8 maybe not so much. Of course it depends on exactly how
the non-blocksize limit accounting/adjusting is done.


agreeing to an increase which continues over time, but which instead
limits itself to a set, smooth increase for X time and then requires a
second hardfork if there is agreement on a need for more blocksize at
that point.

Thanks for the info. Unfortunately I did a decent amount of shorting (and still managed to lose money).  That is the exact problem I've been having; I've been getting a negative balance and I thought it was because my trades were out of order at some point but couldn't figure it out.  Is there an easy way to identify the shorts from the exports?  I've reviewed my exports and it's not really clear and my memory isn't that good to remember all trades.  It also sucks because bitfinex allows you to export your data like 5 different ways and I have no clue which one is the best/easiest for calculating taxes.

Bitcoin is not inherently anonymous.  Anyone who told you that is mistaken.  Also Circle is a company that must comply with AML/KYC laws so they need certain information if they expect to keep operating above the law.

I see bitcoin as the trojan horse to take crypto mainstream.  Governments around the world would fight much harder against Monero and other anon coins if they were the crypto posterboy.  Once bitcoin gets a foothold and sidechains (or something like it) are in place, there can be sidechains for anon txs and other things that would be hard to bootstrap themselves. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:06:35
Having a static address reduces your privacy since all txs are recorded on the public ledger. Generating a new address for each tx makes it much harder for a 3rd party to gain a clear picture of someone's tx activity.

First off, I love breadwallet and continue to recommend it to everyone for a mobile wallet. It's the only mobile wallet I use.
A few things about this update that I'm not thrilled with... Touch ID isn't promted when you launch the app or when you click the new lock icon. When clicking the new lock icon there's only an option to enter a pin (why not touch ID?). I think I'd prefer touch ID prompt when launching the app. Also instead of entering a pin to see balance, I'd prefer just have a tap to show/hide.

This is so incredibly stupid. If you're not an idiot, you can easily send a real address that anyone using any client can use to pay you. Coinbase is an amazing service that makes it easy for a layperson to buy and Bitcoin, therefore, growing the ecosystem more than any other company I can think of. Yes, they control the private keys and use off chain txs but if you don't like that, simply send the Bitcoin to keys you control (for free).

How can you say they don't fully understand the possibilities?  They are pushing for US laws that would allow for hedge funds and other wall street money to be able to invest in bitcoin...which in IMO would lend more creditably to bitcoin and allow for further adoption.  As much as none of us want regulation, let's not be naive, the US GOVT WILL pass some regulatory laws, which at best, will try to "protect the consumers" or at worst ruin bitcoin for most US based businesses.  But nothing the Twinkle twins or anyone else says or petitions will succeed in the sense of the US GOVT not making any laws regarding bitcoin....they will (as unfortunate as that is).

1) I think by showing them that there is a large community of people ready and willing to selectively spend at their company because of the payment option.  Also giving them the data on cost savings compared to the alternatives.  75K people is no joke to some online retailers...I just wish this sub could get organized instead of being so fragmented. I'd also like to hear your input.  
2) My immediate thought was amazon but I think that's an extremely loft goal.  Maybe something a little smaller overstock.com.

I believe bitcoin has high intrinsic value.  
Wikipedia definition for intrinsic value of money:
"In commodity money, intrinsic value can be partially or entirely due to the desirable features of the object as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Examples of such features include divisibility; easily and securely storable and transportable; scarcity; and difficulty to counterfeit. When objects come to be used as a medium of exchange they lower the high transaction costs associated with barter and other in-kind transactions."

I want to see bitcoin succeed.  How will it grow to see it's full potential if governments around the world disallow businesses and people to exchange it for fiat which is required to pay taxes?  We live in a society that has laws which government will enforce whether you like it or not.  Pull your head out of your ass and realize bitcoin is not going to bring us into a new world of lawlessness.

It's a misconception that hoarding bitcoins is bad for the value.  Bitcoin works as a payment system, as well as a store of value.  SAVING is a good thing for the economy...spending more than you take in is the real problem with the economy (see US GOVT).  If everyone saved a little more and spent a little less in the present, it would allow people to build a nest egg which would allow them to follow their dreams of starting a business, buying a house, or other things that they wouldn't otherwise be able to do if they never saved and spent everything in the present.

Yes, I'd be happy to.  I've never done anything like this before but we are all kind of in uncharted territory here.  I'll be brainstorming ideas on how to best implement the effort and make additional posts once we have come to a consensus on the merchant of our choice.  
We'll never know if we don't try and no one is going to do this for us.

I sold some AAPL stock in order to buy BTC....it was frustrating because I sold the stock, had to wait 3 days for the funds to clear, then pay a $25 wire fee (unless I wanted to wait another week for them to mail me a check). The whole time I was thinking, "just give me my money already".  For me, it really highlighted the fact that I was not in control of my money.  I had to get "permission" from my brokerage and then wait for my bank to say "ok it's cleared now" to use MY money....BTC puts the power of my money back in my hands, and that's why i love it so much.

I can't watch at the moment, what did he say?

This happened to my friend when he was trying to pay me back through coinbase.  He sent to the wrong email.  I quickly registered that email (which previously didn't exist) and signed up with coinbase with that new email.  The coins were there. I hope this helps and that the email you sent to doesn't belong to anyone yet...

For the past several months.  Upwards of 20 transactions and had no problems so far.

Setting up an account with Coinbase for a "checking account" and creating a paper wallet for a "savings account" is about as easy as setting up bill pay with traditional online banking.

Can you tell me about what was discussed or provide a translation? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:43:59
Me too.  100% positive experience for me so far.  Done about 5 different buy transactions.

+1 for bitcoin having high intrinsic value.  
Wikipedia definition for intrinsic value of money:
In commodity money, intrinsic value can be partially or entirely due to the desirable features of the object as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Examples of such features include divisibility; easily and securely storable and transportable; scarcity; and difficulty to counterfeit. When objects come to be used as a medium of exchange they lower the hightransaction costs associated with barter and other in-kind transactions.

Erik Voorhees at the San Jose conference in May discusses the role of Bitcoin as money.

I am not anti SR...I actually think it's awesome but I care more about the success of BTC.  In this case I see it as a double edge sword...the great thing about bitcoin is the fact that you can use it without fear of government/companies getting in the way.  However the media and government can use it's relation to SR to TRY to stop it or at least put out negative press/information which will hurt bitcoin's ability to reach it's full potential.

They basically say that there is a lot of interest from wall streeters putting their personal cash into it and that the senate hearings were positive.

"What is Bitcoin?"
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:50:13
I agree.  It will never go mainstream without something like this.  The GOVT/media will continue FUD if it can be used "anonymously" by drug dealers, money launderers, and terrorists.

In the coinbase app, if you goto Buy, then put in 1 BTC you can see the current buy price.  But I would use an app that had coinbase and some exchange prices on there.   Also I think a watch only wallet feature would be nice.

Those two things can be very important in the eyes of the mainstream media.  A face to lend more creditability to bitcoin would be a good thing so CNBC stops asking "who created the bitcoin company?" and "i thought it's only used to buy drugs?"
