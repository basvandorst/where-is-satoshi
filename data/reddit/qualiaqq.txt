I remember not wanting to buy at around 300 because it seemed too expensive.

Very interesting stuff, I'll have to look into it more. You make a very compelling case and I have seen some success stories come up here about a guy becoming a millionaire. I imagine if this every becomes widely adopted you'll all be millionaires. lol
One thing that is bothersome though. If it ever does become widely adopted I fear the government will try to make it illegal because they can't tax it. Not that making it illegal in the US or w/e won't kill it or anything, but I do wonder how that would play out.

Sorry, I'm kinda a noob to all this (I don't own any bitcoins), but isn't the price of bitcoin pretty volatile? I mean hindsight is 20/20 as they say and it is easy to say someone could of made a lot of money. Investing in bitcoins to make money is risky isn't it?

I've been flirting with bitcoin for some time now and I still own no bitcoins. This, as you might expect, has been a source of regret. When it was at 200, I was thinking I'm too late to the party, then it went to 1200. I wanted to buy bitcoins the other day when it dropped to below 600 USD, but just wasn't in a position to. I'm actually amazed the price recovered as well as it did and as fast as it did. As the guy in the video was saying, its hard to imagine something happening that would kill bitcoin. I'm going to look into it more after finals. I just hope the price doesn't "go to the moon" before then.

I was reading [this]( post from 4 months ago when someone was asking how to invest 800 dollars. Top response was buy 8 bitcoins and I was just thinking shit that would be near 8k in value today. Funny thing is one of the replies was "not at these prices." I've been saying that to myself for months now and I'm still saying that.... and I still don't own any bitcoins :(
