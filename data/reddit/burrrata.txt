Is there a list of pizza shops that accept cryptocurrencies?

Ideally not just hand-wavey high level blog posts, but explanations in simple English, with helpful pictures/diagrams, and code examples exploring each component in the system and why it matters, building towards a toy implementation of the bitcoin network.

This is amazing. I've heard of the book but didn't know it was in such an easily accessible format. Thank you :)

Ok so I'm going through lopp.net, and it's amazing, but there's a lot... Are there 2 or 3 resources you'd recommend that really resonated with you or changed the way you thought about something?

I'd heard about Mastering Bitcoin for a long time, but ignored it because it was a "book". Don't make my mistake. Read Mastering Bitcoin. It's amazing :)

The tutorial starts with a b2c centralized database, explains it's limitations, and iteratively updates components to move towards a p2p decentralized network. Anything with code and/or pictures that explains the architecture of Bitcoin itself (cryptographic functions like hashing, public/private keys, state, etc...) and why people actually use it (economics, game theory, freedom, etc...) would be really helpful! Thanks :)

The struggle is real... 
But for the rest of us, what are the best learning resources out there to "understand bitcoin"? Ideally not just hand-wavey high level blog posts, but examples with pictures, English explanations, and code examples? Thanks :)

Agreed. I've been checking it out and it's blowing my mind. Aside from not having code examples it's pretty much exactly what I'm looking for :)

A true classic
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:35:16
You gonna crosspost that to or...

Yes exactly. I love what the technology enables, but it can be very overwhelming for someone to go from just reading about it to actually building/doing stuff with it. To help with this I'm creating a tutorial that builds up a toy "blockchain" up from first principles, explaining each design choice along the way and what it enables, building towards more complex systems like Bitcoin. I'm looking for resources that have pictures and/or code examples that I can incorporate and/or link to. Out of the resources you mentioned is there 1 or 2 that you think would be ideal for this? Thanks :)

That's awesome! Thank you :)
