He's openly mentionned that he visits for trolling only. 4 days ago, [he mentionned]( in "I had to suffer your [shibes] spam and uninteresting and technologically worthless arguments for months in my own subreddit [So now that dogecoin is dying I'll dance on its grave." 
So essentially he hates the fact that shibes come here to spam, but then he x-posts a flamebait post on obviously trying to cause retaliation. He's a troll, a kid who needs attention. Yes, "fuck that guy".

Interesting. Thanks! I also think it's about intentions with the currency. In my case I'm holding on my Bitcoin assuming it'll be worth more down the road (limited supply, increasing demand). My intentions, however, are not to cash it out for fiat but to use them to purchase stuff. In the meanwhile, I'll use an inflationary currency for my day-to-day small transactions. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 00:02:39
I think I understand your point, but there are like10 better arguments to altcoins than this one. We aren't even close to an bloated blockchain or to an overloaded network. If people would actually use Bitcoin as a currency and not as a speculative asset, than maybe 5 years from now we'd be in trouble. But that's a big maybe. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 07:18:41
Good for you. If you didn't have kids, and you had a steady revenue then it's okay to gamble with your money. I've lost and won thousands at poker in casino. I don't care because I have a good salary and no kids or wife. 
I'm not trying to tell people what to do with their money. Really I couldn't care less what you do. All I'm saying is that the common sense says that if you want to build "life savings" because you are expecting to live a full live with house + 3 kids + car + etc., then investing more than 10% in a risky business (no matter what that business is), is not the right move. 
It doesn't mean that you won't hit full-house once in a while.

Hmm, replace Bitcoin with gold and see if that makes sense. I mean, why is it gold that is the most used as a store of value? It's an artifact of history. Replay this universe simulation with slightly different parameters and perhaps some other rare material would be used as gold.

Well. I don't want to start giving financial advices on reddit because I think that's not the place for that. But if you have 90% of your porfolio in 1 bucket, no matter what that bucket is, I'd say you are doing it wrong. What if there's a hole in the bucket you haven't thought of? You really should have stocks, bonds, commodities (gold) and, if possible, real estate. I'm talking about life savings here obviously.

Why would you hold it if you wanted it to succeed as a currency? USD wouldn't have been very successful if instead of using it, people would have hold on to it 200 years ago. However, I have to agree with you that Dogecoin is a terrible store of value.

Divisibility isn't an incentive to spend. If, say, 1 million BTC were to be printed every year, ever, then there wouldn't be as many hoarders because you're buying power would tend to decrease. There would be people that would actually spend their BTC.

I'll have to disagree here, there are plenty of examples of innovation happening in the altcoin world. I think that people who have a bit too much "faith" are thepeople who refuse to recognize that there's a slight chance that BTC might not be the leader 5-10 years from now.

My average is at about 650$/BTC but I obviously own less than him. I'm 100% with OP though, not so much because of how "awesome" bitcoin is but because there's no point for me at selling at loss. "Don't buy what you can't afford to lose" is what I'm standing for, and if I end up losing 10% of my portfolio then be it. 
If you never fail it's because you don't take enough risks.
@_date: 2014-04-12 13:22:00
Sorry, that's what I meant to assume. For example, I'd allote 100 BTC to the side chain, then I'd redistribute those inputs in the side-chain to the exact same public addresses in the original dogechain. (not sure if the different address format could be an issue).
Then people could use their private key in the original dogechain to claim ownership of the new coins in the side-chain.

I feel that people who are preaching that are essentially trying to convince newcomers to buy BTC (aka pump the price) because they feel unsafe about their investment and want to cash out, at least partly. I can't think that anyone who fully assumes and understands the investment risk into BTC would pretend that it's ready for prime time. It might very well crash to ashes for various reasons.

HotBot, Excite, Lycos, AltaVista -( small PageRank gap) -&gt; Google

And nothing appears on my CC statement, so no clutter.

I need to buy something **now** (e.g., iPhone 5) which is worth the equivalent of $500. Will you use the deflationary or the inflationary asset? Why?
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:58:22
I agree with your arguments. It's only that I find it very ironic when people are pissed at outsiders mentioning Bitcoin is a scam and at the same time keep ditching all the altcoins in the same "garbage coins" bucket. I prefer to have a much more balanced stance on the topic.
@_date: 2014-06-01 00:10:41
I agree with you that Bitcoin is the leader and most likely remain so for a fairly long period of time. But IMO putting all your eggs in the same basket is a bad idea. For example, I'd much rather buy a diversified portfolio with ebay, overstock, amazon and alibaba in it, then simply buying Amazon stocks because of "it's the biggest one".
This seems to stand true even more for something as new as Bitcoin. For example what if a new coin came up that was doing something useful instead of simply hashing proof-of-work? That'd be much more sustainable then the waste of energy the blockchains are right now. I see a lot of people here that are quick to dismiss altcoins as "garbage clone", but if you read the white papers some of them are truly innovative.
Finally, assuming a payment processor comes in and handles 1000 different cryptos, I wouldn't see why a merchant wouldn't go with that processor instead of one that only does BTC. Same amount of work for the merchant, but access to a larger audience. I'm not sure what scientific experiment Jimmy did, but I'd think that the analogy doesn't stand here.
I think something like 70% BTC, 10% LTC, 10% DOGE and 10% other diversified is a much more sound strategy than 100% BTC

Yeah. Let me put it another way: I still haven't received any information that make me think my initial investment was wrong. The market moved, but I don't think it moved for the right reason. I'm sticking with my initial assessment of Bitcoin and the technology it carries.
If, say, I got a signal that seemed to indicate that public/private crypto was flawed in some way, then shit I would sell ASAP. This isn't the case, I'll keep going with my initial risk assessment and yes I might lose.

I haven't fully wrapped my head around sidechain. But here's my question to you.
Around February 2015, the first 100 billions will have been mined. Could someone take a snapshot of all of the addresses at that exact final block (before the 10K inflation reward), and generate the exact same block distribution on the Dogecoin sidechain. (i.e., 100% premined but allocated to the owners of doge on the the original dogechain).
Now if I own 3000 dogecoin on the original blockchain, I could redeem my 3000 "sidedoge" by importing my private key in the "sidedoge' wallet and claiming ownership? Would that work?
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:29:23
It's not really a problem, it's by design. I have no incentive to use my BTC for daily transactions, being deflationary I know it'll be worth more 20 years from now. Dogecoin has 5% inflation, so if I don't spend it I lose my buying power over time. 
In my portfolio, I treat bitcoin like gold and dogecoin like cash. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:16:33
Well it depends what you mean by "hurting". I do think that Bitcoin is an ideal substitute for gold and I think the large scale adoption of Bitcoin will happen regardless of if people end up using it as a everyday currency or not. I think that hoarding is in the human nature, and if I have the option of hoarding a deflationary or inflationary currency, I'll go with the former. 


I'll admit I never studied history of gold. Why did it stop being used as a currency, and started being used as a store of value? 
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:52:39
Given that this is in direct competition with QuickCoin I'd say it's relevant to this sub. IMO we should get in touch with the devs for them to allow BTC tipping soon.

@_date: 2014-06-17 23:46:42
Who said you had to tip 1/3 of a penny? That's a constraint you are giving yourself. I try to tip between the equivalent of $0.25 and $1, and sometimes go as high as $5 or $10. 
Also, what do you mean by reversible?! There's no going back once you tip, unless the tip expires. 
It looks to me like you don't really know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:01:33

I don't like the trend of going off-chain. The revolution isn't Bitcoin, the revolution is the blockchain. Off chain means centralized and unsafe. 
I'd really like to see one two-way pegged side-chain targeted at micro transactions. A side chain that can never be cluttered enough.

@_date: 2014-06-05 23:26:11
But once they feel richer, would they spend their inflationary or deflationary assets first? Say I have 10 BTC which down the road have the equivalent buying power of $50,000. And I also have $50,000 USD in my savings account. I feel that my 10 BTC make me much richer, but why would I spend 0.2 BTC to buy a computer when I could just as well use $500. 
That's how I feel about gold. I own a significant amount of it, and unless I have a big purchase coming (house, boat, medical bills) why the hell would I sell/trade my gold when I still have plenty cash available? There's a finite amount of gold, while the gov keeps printing $75B every month.

@_date: 2014-04-11 00:30:30
Well that's one way of seeing it. Another way of seeing it is that you are diversifying your portfolio with investments with different risk/reward ratio. Sure you could go on an do nothing but pay your mortgage every month, but then you end up with a 100% safe portfolio. Your variance will be extremely small (exceptions being with the housing bubbles), but then your average performance will be very small. Or you buy stocks, currencies and cryptocurrencies and you get a different portfolio mix. It very much depends on how much you like risk.

@_date: 2014-06-05 23:20:53
So the price rose because you paid with BTC? To me your example is actually helping the thesis that deflationary doesn't provide an incentive to spend. If you had used cash instead of BTC, you would have ended up with 30$ extra in total asset. But instead you spent something that has a limited supply to get something that has unlimited supply. And you are 30$ poorer now (probably much more 20 years from now). 
Additionally your example is based on the idea that a 30% increase is something normal. Id think that once the market cap is over $100B big swings like that would be much less likely. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:17:54

Now my initial comment had to do with the typical person building the typical portfolio. I belive (just my opinion) that if a typical person with an average knowledge of technology invest more than 10% in a new risky technology, then they are not investing anymore, they are gambling.
It doesn't mean that once in a while gambling won't work, all I'm trying to say is that it's not a sound investment strategy (for the average people).

Exactly. I can't wait for when people stop thinking about cashing back to some fiat. In the case of Zimbabwe I don't know how widespread internet is. But in any country with high internet access, using crypto for most transactions would be much more frictionless than having to cash out to fiat.

Also that example of having $100, spending $10 and waiting for the $90 to be worth $100 again is madness to me. Even if that increase is due to the deflationary (versus speculative as it is now), why would I spend that $10 equivalent of Bitcoin if I have $10 USD in my pocket?

Bitcoin facilitates scam the same way internet lead to a whole new environment for scamming. But saying Bitcoin = scam is just mental lazyness for failing to understand the technology. 
I think people will get educated the same way they got educated with phishing etc. It'll take time.

Not in the traditional definition at least. I do agree that traditional economics models aren't the best to describe cryptos.

Double confirm, some reliable source validated the initial source.

The more search queries + clicks you have gathered the better your results. The better your results, the more search queries + clicks you get.


I'll give you this one. The 0.5% exchange fee might be something that would turn off people. But I'd think that if an altcoin came in and offered the type of improvement PageRank was for information retrieval, people would be okay with 0.5%.

Why not a well balanced and diversified portfolio? "BTC or nothing" sounds like a cult phrase
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:22:27
**tl;dr I'm of the opinion that diversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio is a sound strategy vs. putting 100% in BTC because "network effect"**
Ideally I'd diversify against all potential risks, although that isn't possible. For example quantum computers come in an break public/private key crypto. Maybe not so much of an issue since most of Internet would be broken, but just showing the most extreme example.
Here are a few that I'd like to hedge against:
1) Wastefulness of PoW: a lot of energy is being wasted (yes yes, I know, not much compared to this and that, still). In case of mass adoption, there might be a need to find a more eco-friendly alternative. For this I hedge with PoS coins and with PoW coins that use the cycles to do computation that isn't worthless hashing.
2) Weak scripting language: this second one sort of goes with the first one. I'm not convinced Bitcoin has the best scripting language, and I think that the scripting language is a huge component of a blockchain. For that I go with coins that have better scripting language.
3) Adoption **as a currency**: I'm fairly convinced that BTC will be adopted as a hoarding replacement for gold and the likes, but I still haven't seen evidence that people were willing to use it for day-to-day transactions. Mostly because of the limited quantity and deflationary status. Would I buy coffee with gold? No, unless I was completely out of cash. I know gold is a very limited supply, while cash keeps getting printed every year. So I'll keep all my gold for my retirement because its value would be expected to go up. I feel that many many people around here have the same opinion of Bitcoin. They are hoarding it for long time in the future, hoping to cash out eventually. This could hurt adoption, which in turn could hurt value. For this I hedge with inflationary currencies. 
4) Centralization: Less and less nodes on the network, more and more hashing power in the hands of a few. That's one of the ones I'm not too sure how to hedge against, but I'm definitely concerned about this. Perhaps I could get some ASIC-resistants and more "democratic" coins, but I haven't researched this enough.
I keep trying to identify new risks, and I try to stay up to date with new coins coming up to see how each minimize the risks. It's a time-consuming process, but I feel better investing in crypto-currencies knowning that I'm not putting all my eggs in the same basket.

Part of the answer is providing an easy mechanism to get paid in BTC at a premium. I either get the equivalent of $2000 in USD, or the equivalent of $2100 in BTC. Then I'd bet at least 20% of my friends would make the switch.

But I think we can all agree that if it's not branded Bitcoin, it's pointless and a waste of time. /s

Huh? Is that really how you see tipping?! I see it as serving the same purpose as tipping IRL. You sing well? Have a tip. You drew something coop? Have a tip. You got dumped by your gf? Have a tip and get yourself a beer. 
Why would it be anything else than that? I think you've been doing it wrong all this time. Or you're simply a greedy bastard :)

Why the hell would you sell at $10 if you bought at $1000? That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. If you bought at $1000, it meant you had enough money to take a large risk, and if so, why would you care for a few tens of dollars (or even hundreds of dollars).
The only exception to that would be from a tax perspective, if you could use that loss to offset other gains.

He has invested 140,000$ and owns 770 BTC so his average is 181.81$/BTC.
Also I highly doubt someone who has 140,000$ to invest in anything would be dumb enough to invest more than 10% portfolio a risky new technology (cryptocurrencies or other)

I don't quite understand why people are so eager to hate on Bitcoin. I have many smart software engineers friends whom I would expect to be the first to be excited about the possibilities of the technology. But instead all they like to repeat is how much of a bubble/ponzi scheme Bitcoin is. Why can't they fucking see the nice things about it?! I suspect that they feel they missed the boat, and now want to see it fail to justify them passing on the opportunity.
