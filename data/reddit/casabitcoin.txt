Lol. It will of course have a trollbox, it's simply inevitable.

Ha, thanks! Be sure to sign up, it's all 100% free!

This would actually integrate many different features, search only being one of them. Checkout what we are thinking on our landing page,

Hi Antonshka, thanks for your feedback. 
While obviously lacking content at the moment, Casa Bitcoin allows users to create and share their own blog, store, events, groups, polls, share media, websites, news and more. The site has a more complex organizational structure and features that will help bring the Bitcoin community together so that it can grow faster. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:12:49
No, most of this site has been custom coded. 
Best, 
J

Thanks for the feedback. Will get this fixed asap by increasing the max length and attempts. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:34:18
Thanks for the tip! 
@_date: 2014-12-27 23:04:31
Users wanted ;)

Thanks for your feedback. Would you recommend making email address a non-mandatory field when signing up? The site does not store btc address or any type of payment information for that matter. If you want to be a part of the network and are that concerned about privacy what's stopping you from using a fake name? 
My coin is on a paper wallet in a safe built into stone. I recommend not risking the loss of your stash by storing offline.
I will continue to consider your feedback and try to think of more solutions. The way I see it, there are many different bitcoin related sites that us, "enthusiasts" often check. Why not consolidate the majority of it (excluding exchanges etc) for the sake of convenience? 
Cheers, CB

Mission Statement:  To build a "swiss-army-tool" for Bitcoin enthusiasts and help new users and merchants adopt Bitcoin as a currency. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 02:22:18
Thanks, clearing the caches on my side.
@_date: 2014-10-11 03:04:23
You should set-up a profile to do so on The Bitcoin Social Network, CasaBitcoin.com ;) 
@_date: 2014-12-27 22:40:40
Team Casa thanks you!

Well said  - Best comment on the thread. 
You're the man Luke! Don't let these ignorant, ingrates bring you down.
If y'all actually own bitcoins, you should support Luke Jr with CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. You really don't want him to stop doing what he does for Bitcoin. 
This thread brings me back to grade school . . . How old are y'all? Grow up! 
@_date: 2014-10-11 20:03:47
Luke doesn't need money . . . 
@_date: 2014-09-27 07:26:19
I just cleaned up the temp landing page just for you. Cheers! 
@_date: 2014-12-21 06:36:17
There is still much to do before launch! You can sign up now though and be one of the very first members. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 19:43:20
We are planning on implementing two-factor authentication as well as advanced ddos protection. We will not sell data. If this is a concern to you may I recommend using an alias? 
@_date: 2014-12-30 02:53:25
FYI, video chat is flash based so it will not work on most mobile devices.

So, I'm a web developer that has built a social network in the past. I'm trying to gauge interest before jumping in head first. 
Off-subject, does anyone know how to change post picture? I'd like to use my logo . . . 
Thanks in advance for everyone's help and feedback. 
To Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:58:46
Please try again. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 05:21:47
I'll take that as a yes. I can do this with two programmers and a writer. I'll work on my landing page for a few though I'm not relying on receiving funding to build it out so it doesn't matter. Rest assured if we do this it's going to look slick. Stock up on popcorn.
@_date: 2014-12-31 23:59:17
LOL, I have setup these sections on Casa Bitcoin Social Network so that anyone can start a group or list a bitcoin related event or PARTY in their area. 
Cheers!

Had to share that . . .
