You develop those things then boast about your product.  Not release something and say "It'll be better soon!"

Venture capitalists invested in it.  They invest in a lot of outlandish schemes on the hopes that one blows up.

They might very well.
They protect Americans, even if they're dumbasses who pretty much flushed money down a toilet.  If they get an opening to nail a bitcoin scam, they will.

The prices have dropped by nearly 20% across every exchange in a few HOURS.  That is not stability.

No, they have 13$ worth of Euros.  Lots of bitcoiners right now dont have ANYTHING thanks to Gox.
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:18:36
Please spark another bubble.  Your crashes are so damn entertaining.
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:15:16
That puts them in money laundering territory.  Banks would rather drop you like a rock than deal with the feds.

Great way to end a marriage.

People are retards.  Thats why we invent and enforce silly laws.  To protect the morons from themselves.  Because we try to care for each other.  The whole "we're a country" thing.

I meant giving more money away to people for bitcoins to lose again.
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:32:09
I'll send a noteto their condo financed with your stolen money that you wont be doing bussiness with them anymore.  Im sure they'll be crushed harder than the ice in their margaritas.

They played their cons too long.  :  /
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:29:17
It was totally Gox, not the panicky trading of an unstable currency receiving bad news...
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:47:26
Except bill likes some ground rules
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:43:49
When you dont have any bitcoins left it wont really matter.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:16:45
That needs to be at the top of the page.

I am so jealous of your market crashes.  I seeth.
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:00:43
  Invest your money in something worth more than libertarian wet dreams.  Commodity investment is risky, whrn the commodity itself is nothing more more than an ideology, your money is as safe as a turkey in a typhoon.  I suggest long term bussiness investment.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:24:16
man, less than 1% per year.   Compared to 20% in less than a day.   Hmmm, bitcoin is obviously the stable currency.
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:42:06
The third time was the 1.1k to 600$ crash.
We're up to 4 or 5 crashes now, and the bitcoin community lines up to get fleeced again...
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:24:33
Bitcoin lost 20% of its value today.  The dollar did not.
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:40:21
The mob is too smart to use bitcoins for anything besides money laundering and scams.  They're a busssiness.
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:16:13
laundering money is VERY illegal.  Bitcoin is like the washing machine for money laundering.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:51:33
Second system got everybody some money back.

Welcome to the free market.

Its called a bank run.  Welcome to the real world.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:25:28
I actually HAVE 13 dollars more than most bitcoiners now.

FDIC insures ALL bank customers.  Not just some.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:38:31
People realize their investment is bad, and all try to sell it at the same time, driving prices down.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:01:08
Most places that accept bitcoin don't actually accept the coins.  They contract with a service that takes the coins and pays out cash to the business.
@_date: 2013-02-08 01:20:35


Way too late for that.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:37:35
No, it actually places it closer to 40$.
