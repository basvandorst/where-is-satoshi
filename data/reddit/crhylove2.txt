First of all, I think the entire foundation of Judeo religion is ridiculous, and there's ample evidence that the Jesus fable was concocted by a Roman committee.  However, it's clear that if you read the verse, Jesus is implying not only to not pay taxes, but to not use money at all.  He's probably implying that the value of someone's labor should not be extralocalized away into something ethereal.  Trade a fish for a chicken, or two fish for some shoes, or.... something along those lines.

Just wait!  One of these banana republics: Greece, Argentina, The US, some 3rd world country is going to print too much fiat and experience hyper inflation again.  It happens all the time (well, on a long enough time line it does).  WHEN that happens (again), the local people will get into bitcoin immediately, and it will displace whatever bullshit currency just failed them previously overnight.  Once that happens, and the local people in this country learn how easy, reliable, secure, and FUN it is to use BTC; They'll never go back.  Long term, their country will start demolishing other fiat based economies left and right.  Just wait.  BTC is brand new.  The world and it's ludicrous economies are old and fail ALL the time.

I love Bitcoin Tipping Tuesdays.  Anybody know why the price went up so much today?  Or was that just the dollar going down?
