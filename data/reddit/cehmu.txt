what rules did i break?
@_date: 2016-04-03 10:39:07
and then deleting them, even though they don't break any rules, is also perfectly reasonable?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:50:09
yes, and even IF bitcoin gets 'banned' in the USA...it still exists outside that jurisdiction.  You get it?

1) The cost of running a full node has been raised as an issue for the past 4 or 5 years at least.  I just bought a second hand computer, 5 years old.  And it cost just over 25% of what a new one at that time cost. Let's say, conservatively, that new hardware now is roughly half the price for equivalent specs.  Then in that case, to get the same bang for buck, we could at least double the block size right now.  
2) You are saying that scaling the blocksize will not help with the scaling problem?  That's like saying that putting in another lane on a highway won't stop traffic congestion, or that you shouldn't buy new shoes for your kids when they grow out of them, because that won't help them. 
3) Nobody WANTED to split the community.  But when forums like this one were actively silencing genuine concerns of many users and lead developers, there really was no choice but to create alternatives.

So, basically, entities with more bitcoin can set up larger channels, and collect more fees.  This in turn allows them to purchase more bitcoin. 
Doesn't take too much imagination to see the end result of this.  All the bitcoin ends up in the control of these large...let's call them "banks".

@_date: 2017-12-14 03:43:38
yep, and these banks will be able to use their returns to buy up even more bitcoin from smaller banks and individuals.  In the end, all the control would naturally flow into the hands of a small oligarchy, or even become a total monopoly. 
At least with the current situation of having miners in control, the miners have to sell off most of the bitcoin they mine, in order to recoup their costs and be able to continue mining.

update (from the gentoo bug page, by luke jr):
Deploying the 'ljr' USE flag to Gentoo as a default quietly was wrong, and has been disabled, as well as splitting the spam filtering off to an independent 'ljr-antispam' USE flag so the rest of my patch is not tied to it. Currently, these changes are only available in the “bitcoin” overlay, but should make it to the main Portage tree within a few days.

@_date: 2014-05-04 05:14:27
actually.... i think the concept of having 21 million 'bitcoin' was quite essential for the first stage of growth.  If it had begun at a 21 trillion bitcoin target, I doubt it would have ever taken off.  Likewise, if there had only been 21 thousand total bitcoin planned, it wouldn't have been enough.  21 million was a great starting goal. 
But we've moved beyond that initial stage now, and 21 trillion bitcoin is in fact very feasible now. In fact, it's pretty much the perfect amount for bitcoin to be used as a global currency .  
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:44:49

Gold is not used as currency though (well, i'm sure there may be obscure examples...but generally not)
The fraud thing, i don't really buy into either.  What's the one thing that ALL bitcoin users have in common?  We're all on the internet.  This is not something we have to protect our grandmothers from, it's a high tech modern payment system, and the people using it are online. If all the exchanges, all the forums, all the social networks had messages about a switchover, and we gave everyone a couple of months to get ready, i really think that 99.99% of people would understand that. 
And that other 0.01% ? sorry, but bad luck to them.  It's still a much lower casualty rate than you'd get by leaving your money in the bank.

There are plenty of currencies where people have to use 1000's or more just to buy every day items, but are there any successful world currencies where people use fractions? 
(and yeah, i know you're gonna come back with "but but but, satoshis!"...but what's the currency called?  what's this sub called?  like it or not, "bitcoin" is the unit we're dealing with)
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:22:08
$500 now is like what $50 was last year.  Do you think we're ever going to see $50 BTC again?  I don't.
And i think if we go high enough in future bubbles, $500 is going to look like $50 looks now.  ie, impossible
@_date: 2014-05-15 10:12:46
this is why i'm like a broken record when i say that 1 bitcoin should be redefined as 100 satoshis. Like it or not, a single bitcoin costing over $1000 puts it out of the reach of ordinary people as a hobby investment.  We need massive grass roots support, but the direction we're going in is pandering to the exact same privileged  few that already control the world. 
Shame. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:11:52
Now to your main point, i see what you're trying to say, but the reality is that bitcoin is a vessel for storing and transferring value.  
Transferring enough bitcoin to buy 2 pizzas would have incurred basically the same transaction charge 3 years ago as it does now.  
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:38:38
are you the one who downvoted me?  
here's what i was commenting on:


and i was clearly showing why that is not true.  
here's a more lifelike example:
we have people A-&gt;K, each of them trades bitcoins:
A&gt;B $10
B&gt;C $25
C&gt;D $15
D&gt;E $75
E&gt;F $200
F&gt;G $255
G&gt;H $75
H&gt;I $125
I&gt;J $110
J&gt;K $1200
that's probably quite a decent approximation of trades in the life of one bitcoin last year. How can you possibly say that for every trade someone loses?  of course some of them lost, and some of them won, but there are a lot of trades where both parties win.  
You can't make any 'end condition', unless you're talking about trading something that is 100% guaranteed to be worthless at some pre-destined date. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:23:10

I think they are included in the market cap anyway, aren't they?  Not as if there's a simple way to find out if they exist or not. Current market cap is total number of coins mined so far, multiplied by current exchange rate for 1 coin.

if it goes like last year, we'll probably go up to double where we are now, and then some more bullshit bad news brings us right back down again,,.,,,and then a slow climb that seems to take forever.  And then just as you give up hope, suddenly everything goes batshit mental and price skyrockets. 
Then it crashes down, but still at a much higher level than it is now.

Gox are fucking idiots.  They could have just played fair, and at the very least they would have been the biggest exchange in Japan when bitcoin finally breaks through here.  
Right now, there is quite a bit of media focus on bitcoin in Japan, and they do like to have at least some focus on the dangers.  I'm on the phone tomorrow to NHK to make sure they get some footage of this.
@_date: 2014-05-05 02:12:59
entire nations have done this with their currency, it's done all the time with stocks and shares...
But you think that something inherently relying on communications technology is not going to be able to achieve that?  
I honestly have my doubts that bitcoin is going to succeed unless the value is changed.  We tried moving to millibits or whatever it was last year...and pretty much failed.  Now there's talk of 'bits', which is a stupid name right from the start, and most people aren't going to agree on that. 
Sure, a renaming of 100 satoshi as 1 bitcoin is not going to be 'easy', but it'd be the most important step we could take to ensure our currency has a future.

i'm not!  all it says is that they have a serious problem, which will likely take months if not years to fix, and they're not giving anyone a satoshi until they do.  Also, they made no mention of why ALL forms of fiat withdrawal are also currently stopped.
And to add insult to injury, they keep sending me emails about how much easier it is to deposit now!  
@_date: 2014-11-20 10:41:45

@_date: 2014-03-09 11:15:13
but he's already attempted to confirm his identity with 2 piece of ID.  The problem is that neither of those definitively ties him to the reddit account.  We're all a bit sick of being scammed, either for money or kicks, and i think if arthur genuinely cares about doing the right thing, he can easily do a proper verification, by a photo of his own face with a handwritten note with today's date on it.

I got yen out end of last year, just did another test yesterday to make sure it's still working.  It might have gone through already, but i haven't checked yet. 
It used to only take a day or 2 to withdraw, so if my funds are not in the bank tomorrow, looks like something funny's happening. 
i already mentioned in some other thread that i'd report back.
p.s.  support don't answer my mails, though.   I asked a fairly routine question a week ago, and never heard back.

Hi Arthur,  in your post yesterday, you showed us some ID photos, and an old family photo.  These prove quite conclusively that Dorian has a brother named Arthur.  however, what they don't prove is that the writer of these posts is Arthur.
For our piece of mind, could you please take a photo of yourself, holding a piece of paper with today's date written on it?

the writing on the wall, is that they're a company in Japan, and they're not even processing Japanese yen (last verified yen withdrawal was 1 month ago!)  They could hire, like, 2 or 3 people with experience in payments processing in Japan, and get it all running like clockwork.  But why not?  There are only two possibilities:
(1) They are a shitty, shitty company, and total incompetent. 
(2) They have no money 
either way,
They're fucked.

why are local withdrawals of Yen also halted?  I didn't try to double spend anything, and i took bitcoin IN from an external source to my gox account, and then tried to take it out as Yen.  
any issues they have with banks, local bank transfers in japan are extremely simple, and there are companies all over japan doing hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, probably even millions more volume than gox.  
So why do these issues coincide EXACTLY with yen withdrawals being mysteriously cut off, with no notice at all from gox. 
I have to pay my rent, and i am facing being evicted, because i have depended on gox to act as an 'exchange' and 'exchange' my BTC for Yen.
@_date: 2014-02-01 16:05:55
Cool, sent u a PM.  
I'm not sure what the law states about timing, but their website still says they'll do yen withdrawals in 24 hours, so i guess we have a strong case.  You don't have to get a lawyer or anything usually, there's a small claims section at the ward office that will look into it free of charge and call them up.  
@_date: 2014-02-19 09:52:53
they must have gotten kicked out of the other place.  Japan has very expensive bonds and deposits for renting, and moving is quite expensive. 
So, why would they move right now, when they are clearly under the spotlight for not being able to pay back their customers?  The only possible explanation is that their landlord has kicked them out.  
Or insanity.  perhaps they could plead insanity.  
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:27:14

yeah, but why will it be wrong to call that new default "1 bitcoin" ???  why does everyone have to mess round with new names?  we have 4 years of branding behind us.  
i agree that 'bits' is better than nothing, but look at how the 'millibit' thing went.  maybe 1 or 2 exchanges used it, but still if someone asks "how much is a bitcoin worth in dollars", the answer is currently about $430
@_date: 2014-02-03 04:07:03
Surprised no-one has mentioned the 'D' word yet.  Charity is their main model of community building, and so far it's working extremely well.  The bitcoin community would be well served to copy that.  
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:03:53
I also didn't take into account the fact that as 1 bitcoin approaches 1 USD, the value of the USD is going to tank.  
But the main point here, is that if people can not afford to buy more than fractions of a bitcoin, we're never going to even see that day.  It's a grassroots project.  I mean, look at who the biggest investors are - people like the winkelwhatevers, pretty much nobodies.  I dunno why everyone here thinks that wall street is gonna come in like a knight in shining armour and put the price up.  
Unless we do something as a community to make bitcoin more attractive to new investors like ourselves, we're gonna go nowhere. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 10:24:09
it's not the current community that we need to worry about.  The fact is that anyone with enough computing power can join the network.  
  What happens, for example, if the Chinese government sees enough threat from Bitcoin that it wants to quash it.  Within very little time, they could have factories pumping out ASICs and gain control of 90% or more of the network.  
@_date: 2014-11-05 05:55:20
So, basically, to believe OP's story, we need to believe that there are TWO people in San Francisco, both interested in Bitcoin, both a couple of years away from retirement, both with the exact same French name....

So you're accusing this organization of lying???  You need to have significant proof of that if you're going to make such accusations.  
I just watched the video, too.  I don't doubt that they are helping connect students and particularly female students to IT technology.  
Of course, i don't know how their donations are managed, just from this video.  But DO YOU???  If you're going to accuse them of being a scam, you really should have some evidence to back up your accusations.  
edit:  
to continue, i just looked up the IRS about their charitable status.  
"The organization must not be organized or operated for the benefit of private interests, and no part of a section 501(c)(3) organization's net earnings may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual"
So, I would at least assume that they are above board as far as the IRS goes.

ok cool. sorry, i had to look up the term 'majoritarian democracy' to see what it actually means, and yeah, i  apologize, i do see that it's not a contradiction in terms.  
not sure how much power i want to give the market, but i can see that there are certainly better options than 2 party, majority rule systems. 
"Direct democracy" is one term i have heard, and i think it will become more prominent as social media advances to be something more than posting photos of your dog and girlfriend on facebook.  But the new one i just found, after a quick google was, "consensus democracy".  Personally, i'm still trying to wrap my head around how 'democracy' and 'consensus' isn't a tautology, But then again, i am not so naive to think that modern systems are anywhere near actually fair and democratic, so i guess i can see how the need arises to further these terms.

The technology is independent of the community.   Even if you think every single individual supporting the bitcoin network is a complete twat, fact remains that the tech gets stronger all the time.  
I fucking hate Justin Bieber for example, but if all his little fans suddenly jump on the bitcoin wagon (i said FOR EXAMPLE!) , then even that would only strengthen the network.  
If you want to see a crypto reliant on community, then doge is yr thing.  Bitcoin will do its thing regardless of the community.  
@_date: 2014-01-25 12:31:32
you are both wrong.  
500 mBTC = 0.5 BTC = ~$400.00, 
10 doge = $0.02
so, 500mBTC is about 20,000 times more than 10 doge.
then. 


500 microBTC = 500 uBTC = 0.0005 BTC = 220 doge = $0.4
500 uBTC is 22 times more than 10 doge.

Ok here's the maths without definite numbers.  Dude gets paid in btc.  His savings also go into btc.  Lets say he saves 10-20% a month.  Last year he would have averaged $100-$200 per month rate for BTC.  Even with a very conservative estimate, he could have put away $10k worth of btc, so, 50 to 100 btc.  This year, those savings are now averaging well over $500 per btc, so last year's savings this year have been worth 3 to 5 times more than they are now.  
we already looked at the day-to-day case, that if he's paid monthly, then he gets the current price to use when converting to fiat.
Sounds great to me.  
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:33:12

To be honest, i have no idea if this OP is real or not.  But i am very interested, and there's a simple way to prove it.  A photo/webcam shot of OP holding a note.  If he can take a photo of his license, he can take a photo of his face.

once bitcoin is secure enough for average Joe, and there are easy ways to change fiat to BTC everywhere (ATMS, post office selling Bitcoin, etc)  Then it should quickly take most of the international transfer volume. 
Also, bitcoin has always been priced well above its actual usefulness.  So if it actual DID gain 100% of international transfers, amazon purchases and gas transactions, i would expect 1 BTC to be many times higher than that volume, because by that point people really could start seriously talking about it replacing gold, and eventually maybe even fiat itself.

this is why the 51% issue needs to be solved programatically.  It's a "bug" in bitcoin code, as far as i can see.  Bitcoin's defining point, is that it replaces "trust" with code.  But I think pooling was one thing that wasn't thought of when the code first went out.

At the heart of bitcoin is the blockchain, which is basically an ever-growing list of all the transactions that take place in the bitcoin network.  
The strength of the network comes from having multiple copies of this blockchain on computer hardware all over the world.  
Every time you make a transaction, it must be confirmed by 6 of those computers in order to be accepted.  If your transaction is not legitimate, it will be denied.  
Something like that, anyway.

bitcoin is still so experimental, and there's already a 'fix' to the entire gox problem called bitcoinbuilder
code is fucking hardcore.  it's like nature itself.

here we have the most beautiful example of how code is like genetics and quickly adapts.  
If humans can somehow throw off this awful shadow of weapon-based armageddon, we're gonna have a shatteringly amazing future, where code and intelligence pushes our entire species forward at a rate similar to what we have seen with bitcoin in the last couple of years.

before anybody asks:  
* internet giants bring out their own cryptos.  'googlecoin' or 'facecoin' or whatever.  Bitcoin would still have a place, but i can see the idiot sheep people going for more centralization and advertising scams for many years to come.
* the rest of this year fails to bring a new bubble, transactions drop off, wall street never joins the party.,.,.bitcoin loses a lot of steam without hype.
* terrorists using bitcoin (or that's the official story...)
* bitcoin finally bites the bullet and follows doge by sponsoring some kickboxer.  In the first round he kills his opponent by a vicious knee to the side of the head.  everybody sells their BTC in shame, and invests in doge, which has a campaign to replace all world leaders with shiba inu puppies by 2025.

fuck all this shit.  Gox isn't giving me Yen!  I paid Yen for my BTC at their inflated rate, and expect to get Yen back when i withdraw.  
This has nothing to do with some technical bullshit, however you want to frame it.  They are in Japan, their 'business' is run on Yen, and yet how long has it been since anyone saw a Yen withdrawal processed?  January 10th?  about then?
If they cannot even pay back simple local bank transfers, this is not an issue about 'tricky computer stuff'.  This is an issue about "we can't pay because we don't actually have your money".  
Pure and simple.  Everything else, yeah sure i can suspend my disbelief.  But they can't even pay out Yen from an exchange in Japan???  That's not due to some bottleneck in Japanese banks.  There are companies processing a thousand times more yen in local bank transfers here every day.  If gox can't do this, it only means one of two things:
they don't have our money anymore,
they do have it and they don't want to give it back.
end of story, please stop these 'technical' discussions.  They either have our money or they don't.  The only way they can prove this is to re-instate Yen withdrawals.     
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:55:35
NO.  Mt Gox clearly owes me money as it is listed in my history on their site as a 'confirmed withdrawal", yet it is not actually in my bank account yet.  
I don't know what you're doing with BTC, other than playing around, but some of us are trying to use it as an actual currency, which is, by the way, what gives it any value in the first place.    
@_date: 2014-10-21 00:28:14
Actually, i would use it MORE if i wasn't worried about the price going up again.  
I used a whole bunch of my BTC last year just before the runup to $1000.  I was planning to buy more to replace them, but then the price started spiking, and i was left waiting for a drop into the $100 range that never eventuated.  
Now i'm more wary, and have rebuilt a small stash of coins just to hold.  
But, for example, if i were certain that i could buy at $400 next year, i would use these coins too.  I just don't want to miss out if the price goes up again.  
@_date: 2014-05-04 06:09:37
not at all.  It's just that 21 million units was a really well planned amount for allowing the network to establish.  Now that the network IS quite established, we really need to look for more atomic units to establish bitcoin properly as a currency.  
In regards to dogecoin, it has been successful with a larger supply of coins, but it has also had the luxury of following a trail already established by bitcoin. 
I believe that if bitcoin had 100 billion units to begin with, it would have been too worthless to ever properly gain traction.  21 mil was a really well thought out number for the trailblazing work that bitcoin has done.

@_date: 2014-05-07 11:09:51
lots of people have been using this comparison lately. 
the HUGE difference is that there never was a unit called '1 gold'.  But we currently DO have a unit called '1 bitcoin'.  
So, changing the default mass unit for measuring gold was easy.  Bit changing the default unit for measuring bitcoin...obviously not so easy.  
Still, if 50% of us could agree to a split, i doubt it would be super hard. That's what i'm asking...what the actual difficulty of such a split would be.  Everyone just seems to go, "ahhh, the devs won't like it" or something.  
Fuck it, if we can't have democracy with a decentralized open source currency, what hope is there?

@_date: 2014-04-08 17:19:19
Well, what are the other options?
1) nothing happens - bitcoin moves sideways forever
2) price drops from here, never to recover
3) price rises, but in a steady un-bubblelike fashion.  
4) price just meanders randomly without any real direction.  
Did i miss anything?
Personally, i think that for any of those scenarios to occur, there needs to be some sort of fundamental change in the way bitcoin is traded.  Perhaps "wall street" is going to offer some fundamental change.  But i doubt it.  Not for a while, anyway.  Bitcoin is still a long way from having the sort of value it needs to become mainstream.  I can't really see the road ahead being any less rocky and steppy than it has been so far.  
@_date: 2014-02-01 16:19:18
Not really.  If they are offering a service, and people pay for it, and then they don't actually provide their service, then that's fraud, pure and simple.  
The main reason they haven't been sued yet is cos they're in japan, and until recently they only screwed over people outside of this country.  But now that they're failing to process yen as well, they WILL be seeing legal action.

The thing is, for such a general subreddit, the label has already been taken.  Sure people can make other technology based subs, but will always have a ridiculous advantage simply because of the name.  
Hence, the inertia against change is very high.  
Edit:  so i agree with you to a point, but when you say a free market allows you to offer many options, in this case it's not true.  There can only be one sub for each label.  If, for example, it would be possible to make a rival sub, with the same name, then it would be more akin to a free market.  But yeah, of course not possible. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 08:36:50
the fact is that most people are sheep and they won't do anything unless it's shouted at them from a TV screen.  so yeah, if bitcoin is gonna go mainstream, it will get largely centralized.  
the plus is that it can be decentralized too, if that's what you want to do. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 08:05:19


The problem though, is that the current definition of a single 'bitcoin' is out of line with the usefulness of 'bitcoin' to pay for things.  That's why there have been ongoing discussions about millibitcoins, and now this thing about 'bits' or whatever.  
Personally i think it's all ridiculously overcomplicated, and by far the simplest and most user-friendly option would be to redefine a single 'bitcoin' as being 100 satoshi.  But I'm met with mostly downvotes for this opinion.  Hey, it's an open source project, and whatever is most popular will end up being used..

we don't have to change at the same time. here's one idea how a rollover could occur:
step 1:  rename the current 'bitcoin' as 'old bitcoin' (or whatever), and announce that old bitcoin is going to be phased out, for the new 100 satoshi standard
step 2:  once everyone has had ample time to prepare, introduce the new 'bitcoin' which is worth 100 satoshi.

i don't think that's true at all.  The switch to millibits failed because they're still just a fraction of the 'base unit' (bitcoin).  
That's why i think the whole 'bits' thing will fail, too. As long as there is a basic unit of 'bitcoin' which is also called 'bitcoin', you'd have to be a bloody idiot to assume people will use anything else.  
The problem of course is that nobody wants to invest in 0.1 of a bitcoin, or 0.01 of a bitcoin.  So right now, everyone's just holding their hands together paying for 'wall street' to come in an buy up billions of dollars worth to push the price up and garner more exposure.  Again, I won't be holding my breath for that one either.

This has long been the most sensible option, but has gone largely ignored.  Would seem more sensible to split at 100 satoshi though, so 1 current bitcoin would split to 1 million new bitcoin.  The satoshi then would be 1/100th of a bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:08:35

but seriously, like it or not, bitcoin has so far made all its major gains in big steps rather than long climbs.

He would have learnt that the best strategy for lying is to actually believe your own lies to a certain degree, while just keeping a vague reminder in the subconscious to be alert in case the lie gets somehow exposed.

My one hope for bitcoin is that it can replace paypal.  Anything else is just a bonus.  But i seriously can't see how paypal has the RIGHT to survive when there is a much much better alternative.  
But the problem is that paypal is HUGE and has $60 billion a year revenue or whatever the actual number is.  It's because of its size and ubiquity that people trust paypal.  It's everywhere, on pretty much every website that accepts payments,  everyone knows what paypal is and what it does, and the vast majority of them can quite easily set up an account. 
If bitcoin is obviously technically a much better alternative, then why isn't it being adopted like wildfire?  The simple answer is that it's not big enough yet.  Bitcoin needs to be much more widely spread and widely held by a greater proportion of the world's people.  
And it's logical that if more and more people are holding and using bitcoin, that the price will also naturally rise due to greater demand and confidence.
The utility of bitcoin is directly proportional to its adoption.  And its price is also directly proportional to its adoption.  
I'm not sure if that means that the utility is dependent on the price, but for sure both the utility and the price are dependent on its adoption, so if increased adoption causes increased price, it will also cause increased utility.

The 'bitcoin' in individual user wallets on gox was not actual 'bitcoin'.  It was SUPPOSED to point at actual bitcoin reserves held in gox cold storage.  However what eventually happened is that the cold storage was empty, while user wallets on the site still showed positive balances.  
The storage bitcoin was real, and it was either stolen by an outside hack, a rogue insider, or seemingly by karpeles himself.  
I think what they're saying is that the stolen bitcoin 'leaked' out over a long period, which makes it harder to track amongst all the legitimate withdrawals from the exchange.

because every single withdrawal mechanism got switched off one by one over a period of about a year prior to the shutdown.  
even after japanese yen withdrawals AND bitcoin withdrawals were cancelled, the exchange still stayed open and even worse, still took deposits!  
from memory, the exchange even remained open for a while, even after the 'transaction malleability' 'hack' was officially announced.  And they continued taking deposits from speculators keen to get in on the huge arbitrage gap that had opened up.
so yeah,,,exchange was open with full knowledge of the 'hack', if you want to believe that story. 
edit:  a 'real world' analogy might be something like this:
there's an online store selling, let's say, Magic the Gathering playing cards. 
Now, that store has had a fire in their stockroom, which they announce.
We don't know if the fire has destroyed some or all of the cards, and we can only take the store's word on how much they know. 
But considering they are selling perishable items, and there has been a fire, then surely it amounts to fraud if they keep collecting money in the full knowledge that they may not be able to deliver the goods that they have been paid for!

Assuming the government is US, or a close ally:
Set up a puppet organisation to sell a small nuclear weapon via TOR to a puppet terrorist group.  Of course the transaction is done in bitcoin. 
terrorists make their 'attack', which goes wrong of course, and the nuclear device doesn't hit the city it was aimed at, but instead explodes in a rural area with fewer casualties. 
The 'investigation' into the attack shows that bitcoin was used (the terrorists laptops were found, with the tor browser still open, of course)
Massive crackdown on all cryptocurrencies, ala war on drugs, ensues.  It is illegal to run exchanges, operate bitcoin businesses, and even to run any sort of client on your own computer. 
With bitcoin illegal in every US-friendly nation, its value plummets to a few cents.  Almost all of the miners turn off their rigs. 
Anyone whose identity is linked with their bitcoin holdings is then issued a warning and told to transfer their bitcoin to a central government wallet, so they can be destroyed. 
With bitcoin now worthless, and most of the mining rigs turned off, the government can then operate their own rig and take control of 99% of the remainder of the network, and then kill it off completely by falsifying transactions.

in every single currency in every part of the world?  yeah sure, just a coincidence....


ok, so here you're admitting (and if you make me look it up for you, i'm gonna be pissed, cos you already know this is a fact) that every single currency AND bitcoin withdrawals were all closed off before the exchange shut down. 
People had literally NO way to get their money or bitcoin out, but the exchange kept open and kept taking deposits.  
at the very very least, doing that was such gross negligence that it would be classed as criminal.  And that's just if you want to believe the story that every single currency output got switched off by forces beyond the control of the exchange.

there doesn't need to be ANY renaming.  "Bitcoin" is already extremely well known, and is easy enough for anyone to use.  
All that needs to be done, is to redefine a single bitcoin as being 100 satoshi.  Bam, done, end of story.  Everyone who currently owns a single bitcoin suddenly becomes a millionaire, and it becomes much more attractive for people to buy and use BTC for many years to come.

But i was never in to bitcoin to "get a return".  I just hated paypal with their stupid conditions and high fees,  so i was happy to find something better for sending money internationally. 
Sadly, bitcoin no longer works that way, but bizarrely is now worth so much that the small funds i used to send to and fro are now valued in the tens and hundreds of thousand dollars.  
If there were any true fairness to the system, it would be people like myself who actually used bitcoin as a currency who should profit, rather than just the lucky few speculators who bought purely for profits.

Where are the numbers on the profits you make from lettuce?  You said you only sell to the employees of one hospital.  How is that gonna make you profitable if BTC drops to zero?
i just read an article that says 1 acre of vertical strawberry farming can bring in $300,000 per year.  But your photos show a much much smaller size for one of your containers, and you said you only have 7 or perhaps 9 of them.  
How is that going to be profitable if BTC goes to zero?

and also a follow up question:  You mentioned that you have contracts to sell vegetables to 30 hospitals.  For their accounting purposes, and also for your own purposes, you would need to be registered as a business in order to do this.  What is the name of your business, so we can look it up and confirm that it does indeed exist and do what you say it does.

If you're selling 4000 head of lettuce per month, you're either registered as a company or up for serious tax evasion.

This is mainly because you don't believe their story about having trouble with japanese banks manually processing withdrawls, right?  I'm sorry, but that part of the story does add up.  I've lived in japan since the 90's and have experienced first hand how antiquated and reliant on human rsources the banks are over here.  
I mean, they only really introduced the concept of the ATM here about 5 or 6 years ago.  It really is that bad.  Credit cards are not well supported either.  It's a cash society.  Salary goes in, and you take out the cash you need for the month, then just carry that round (or usually give it to your wife and she'll ration it back to you).  If you lose your wallet,mthere's a good chance someone will hand it back to you.

i did acid once(1), it was fucking awesome.   There was a biennial display at the modern art museum, and as we walked into the foyer, peaking on some purple ohms, right in front of us was a huge glass case, maybe 5 metres high and 10 metres long, filled with a **maze**.  Looked seriously impressive walking in, like some huge circuit board in a tank.  That's what we all thought it was, a circuit board.  
Got closer, and one friend starts getting kinda hysteric.  "There's ants inside it!!!"  We all get closer, and everyone sees the same thing.  The tracks of what we thought was a circuit board are all ant trails, full of living ants.  "Bloody hell!!! It's a giant ant farm!!!"  
That was pretty epic.  Like mountain hiking in China, surfing some big waves, watching my own vegetables grow in front of my eyes.   That's the sort of experience that makes life something other than a factory processed wrapped-in-plastic consumer boredom nightmare.

hey!  i have an even better idea!!!  if we're gonna live in fantasy land where real world economics and laws no longer apply, how about this:
BTC should be a currency that just increases in value against the currency you bought it, at 10% every week, regardless of what the rest of the world is doing.  
or perhaps, if i were some sort of evil overlord, how about making it a currency that DECREASES in value against the exchange currency at 10% per week?
ok...so then, back to reality...if making it a currency that increases by 10% or decreases by 10% is unlikely...then what about just 1% for those rates???  you're still going to get massive investors in to sink your ship in the first week.  The entire market would be bought on week 1 and sold on week 2.
of course, the other alternative is complete central control, ala China...which at the moment seems to be working ok... but how long that will last remains to be seen

@_date: 2013-05-01 03:12:45
Thinking outside the box (or inside the new, bigger, bitcoin box)...  
if bitcoin became common as a payment system, that would also mean that fairly instantaneous payments would be possible anywhere in the world.  SO, the possibility of cash on delivery (or coin on delivery) payments would be much greater.  
In an world where bitcoin is commonly used, here's what could happen:
buyer pays a fee to the post office for shipping. 
seller ships item.
buyer receives item and pays the cost of the item to the postie.
seller receives coin.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:54:26

One more question, (if i may?)
There seems to be a fairly significant proportion of the community that is actively cheering for Bitcoin to gain more and more recognition from the existing establishment.  
My main reason for being interested in Bitcoin, is because i got ripped off too many times by PayPal for online transactions, and i really want to support an alternative.  So, it was quite disheartening to see so many people getting excited about an announcement from PayPal that they are 'looking into Bitcoin'.  
Has this general enthusiasm for Bitcoin marrying with establishment recently flourished?  Or did i just not pay enough attention before?  
@_date: 2013-10-20 08:52:15

the bank is under intense scrutiny for alleged connections to crime.  The CEO is being asked to resign.  Like it or not, Bitcoin is often associated with 'underworld activities'.  
If the CEO is forced to resign, the new boss will almost undoubtably be issued with the task of 'cleaning up the bank's image'.  Which would mean canceling the accounts of possibly troublesome entities.
Now you know, and I know, that bitcoin is much more than just a haven for illegal activity, but unfortunately if someone does have to go through and clear out 'risky' accounts, then bitcoin is still generally viewed in that domain.

i think the silkroad/drugs connection is something bitcoin should embrace and be proud of.  If we're going to make an alternative currency and get rid of a lot of the political / economic bullshit that enslaves people, then we should also embrace the fact the people can choose how they spend their own recreation time, and what they do with their own bodies.  
so sick of hearing that SR is a 'black mark' on the bitcoin record.

It's also the best guess as to the cause of deja vu.  Your mind gets the raw info and it does its thing in your brain, and sometimes there is a confusing lag between one brain process and another.  And it is that lag which makes us think, "hey, didn't this happen before?"

there is no record of Ghandi ever actually saying that:

it finished literally 1 or 2 minutes before i made the post.  I was excited...i had to tell someone.  
@_date: 2013-05-09 11:22:55
how about Coin Investment Association ?
@_date: 2013-10-07 16:45:16
then, on the other hand, maybe he was kind of busy running the biggest illegal drugs ring the planet has ever seen, and didn't really think about every single contingency...
@_date: 2013-06-23 08:17:06
(1)might have gone a few more dips after that ;)
@_date: 2013-04-22 12:54:48
thanks,. that's a great explanation
@_date: 2013-07-14 06:28:14
But then, the bitcoin economy would never grow.  
@_date: 2013-09-15 15:39:57
i still don't even know what a kilobyte is :p
@_date: 2013-08-30 09:04:21
bitcoin is going to be bigger than amazon.  Just give it time.

..until of course, it goes truly global, and everyone can just swap it with their mates, like they currently do for pot

So, from about 9:20pm until nearly 9:30pm (Wed Dec 4th)
sorry, i probably overestimated the length of the segment...but it had a lot of content covered.

isn't that a bit like using cash that has been used for drug deals?  of which nearly all of it has...

says the guy selling paper wallets ;)
@_date: 2013-05-08 12:36:46
thanks!  see you down there ;)
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:06:05
you realize i WILL actually see this in my email next week, right?  
@_date: 2013-06-20 12:37:17
thanks for commenting on the internet about that.  Did you stop to think that just MAYBE an entirely new form of currency MIGHT have a few difficulties interfacing with the existing monetary structures that it could possibly replace in the future?
@_date: 2013-05-14 23:21:33
They don't check their grammar, either.
@_date: 2013-06-29 14:47:02
this is the correct legal advice, and i have no idea why it got downvoted. 
@_date: 2013-09-14 14:45:16
Japanese don't even trust credit cards.  It's a cash society.  Don't hold your breath for btc adoption here.
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:31:15
The system i heard was the same, but seller also puts in the $10.  That way, the seller would also lose if they do a no show.

if i was running gox, fucking over the FBI probably wouldn't be THAT high on my list of "batshit crazy things to do that would probably get me killed"
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:58:48
...and my bitcoins 
@_date: 2013-05-12 13:10:19
it's so volatile, that just when you think you can depend on its volatility, it goes all steady.  :p

who wants to hear about cyber currency while reading dick jokes?
@_date: 2013-09-21 10:40:18
there must be a better way to do it that uses less electricity.   i hope. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:56:41
the biggest risk to the price of bitcoin is ... ...that all the people involved in it are only interested in the price of bitcoin.
if we don't start USING it, there is NO point!
