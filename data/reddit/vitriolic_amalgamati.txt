there are also tumbling services that are used for this purpose... you can create an anonymous crypto wallet address that isn't tied to anything that can be used to identify you, everyone who wants their crypto that they purchased under their ID to be anonymous puts it into the tumbler, it mixes everyone's crypto together and deposits amounts of crypto to your new anonmyous wallet until it matches what you put in
So, only the tumbling service can link one address to the other... you can have anonymity based on how much you trust the company to not keep a database record full of transaction history linking the ID'd wallet to your anonymous one

It is obvious but means nothing to 99% of those of us in this market, this is a marketing game now and to a slightly lesser extent one of engineering as well (transfer fees and transaction times can still hold some bearing)
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:56:06
you can buy again to decrease your average... (16000 + 10000 + 10000) / 3 = 12000
If you think it's worth it, if you have tons more liquidity buy until your horde per unit cost you as close to 10k as possible hope that it goes over that again in the short term. When it does, sell until you're back in the black with the same treasure hoard you have now except you basically paid less than 12000 for it instead of 16
I wouldn't risk being optimistic, work your average with the market or just hold... I'm sure one day, maybe even in a few years, it will be back over 16 but probably not before it goes way lower
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:03:56

@_date: 2018-01-31 16:08:27
Well.. Hopefully you didn't dump a huge sum into it at that point, if you have investment $$ left over for market fluctuations like what we're seeing now then you can still buy the dips to keep your average on par with the market... Prices are so much lower now that you can decrease your average heavily without having to buy up so much more so that's the upside
e.g. buy 3x times the amount now you bought in at 18500 and that would be: (18500 + 9910 + 9910 + 9910) / 4 = 12057.5 your cost per coin -&gt; I'd be shitting myself a lot less if I could sell a coin for this amount at a profit vs 18,500

no.. the market is far too full of people who dumped all their money in during the crazy climb to 19,500 in december
they invested way more than they were comfortable with and the early investors who've been contributing since before 2017 are calling it quits with good reason + reaping in that sweet sweet ultra low tax capital gains $$
this is what happens when too many people who don't know what they're doing get into a good thing...
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:54:38
yeah it certainly isn't conducive to a creative environment... the debate has long since devolved into a shadow war where 1 seems to be focusing on engineering a better product \(historically they always lose out\) and the other simply launches smear campaigns \(winning almost always happens through better marketing as most people by far don't really care and will allow themselves to get brainwashed by whichever team's propaganda requires them to think the least, keeping the bitcoin name is going to be the main factor each time\). it's obvious which is which when you visit 1 sub vs the other
unfortunately, rather than invest in the better product, even people who know better will still go for the one with better marketing because of those sweet sweet gains
But karma's a bitch, the current team will probably get muscled out too and they'll be dealing with a dumb fork name while a malicious team aggressively smears them while corrupting the protocol and keeping the more valuable name

@_date: 2017-11-23 12:36:05
That's fine
If youre saying you absolutely trust all exchanges in the world that if we left millions on their floor indefinitely that they wouldn't touch it
Even the Chinese ones? Even the Russian ones? They have absolutely no regulation...
That money wasn't earned by them.. It pools up unaccounted for, In the millions, if not hundreds of millions, all year long. That is money that no one's been going back for. That's a fact
Every single dollar that's unaccounted for by any exchange will never be going into the hands of a seller during a withdraw process... That's also a fact
I don't care if coinbase is legit. IF that's the case, the rest of the world's worth of black crypto that lost their liquidity will eventually devour it's reserves like a school of piranhas on a dead cow
I don't need to prove shit... I'm here to find out if you guys were aware and why you weren't worried about it.. If you have absolute faith then keep trading and see what happens.
But if you don't trust them completely with all this money that we left there for them... that you realize they probably wouldn't just keep that money around in good faith for you, then that means crypto liquidity is a huge elaborate illusion... it also means you've been trading zero for zero this entire time
If you do have absolute faith those in charge of most of the exchanges popping up all over the world are upstanding trustworthy regardless of lack of regulation, then you have nothing to worry about and we don't have anything to discuss - and I wish you the best of luck

No... For every Sell, there's a Buy
that isn't false
but that has nothing to do with moving any money around... even if there was a trade for USD
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:21:02
His response doesn't address that it's the fiat the exchanges are holding in good faith for the sellers who want to withdraw
is that not the real problem being discussed here?
He seems overly concerned with crypto (shocking...)
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:31:00
Yes that's all completely correct
but bitcoin isn't mainstream yet, you can't buy things with it directly. You need to exchange it back into fiat for that still
When we're all bitcoin millionaires, how are we going to spend it if the Exchanges run for it with all the fiat the moment we start trying to take out too much?
We'll be left with all our bitcoin and nothing to buy with it...?
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:07:15
Lol if you prefer..
I guess you're saying you have full confidence in all the world's exchanges.. Even the Russian ones.. Even the Chinese ones
That the hundreds of millions pooling at their feet all year long hasn't been touched by them.. Because a single dollar missing is a dollar a seller is not withdrawing
No legit exchanges can fill the void of the ponzi ones will be leaving behind.. Even if you trust coinbase not to be doing this
If you have such belief and faith that none of those vaults are empty and nothing short opening them up and literally showing will shake this.. Then I guess that's your perogative?
I really can't say anything more except best of luck...
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:11:13

@_date: 2017-11-22 22:16:58
That's a very interesting argument. It's true, we've seen things like this grow to such a size that they don't collapse immediately
But a lot us aren't lifers. We're here to buy and sell and trade
At some point some of us will want to sell... not grow old and live poor while being crypto billionaires. Eventually some of us will want to cash in at least a tiny amount of crypto (maybe enough to buy a modest lambo..)
If there's no serious money that any Exchange would allow to be withdrawn from them... and there's no convenient way to turn crypto into fiat
then.. what's left? trying to sell a million worth of satoshi on localbitcoins... it would take a life time
Your argument is about gambling on people not going to other Exchanges and trying to withdraw from those as well when their primary Exchanges go mt.gox on us. Legitimate Exchanges (if they exist..) would never be able to fill such a massive void of fiat demand from crypto-millionaire traders should they decide to partake in some reward of all their hard work trading
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:25:45
Please bare with me... I'm trying to understand your counter argument. Are you saying that there isn't a lot of $ sitting in the Exchanges that they haven't earned, placed there by Buyers who Funded their accounts with fiat which was originally intended for the Seller?.. that there aren't piles of it exactly equal to the amount Funded by Buyers subtracted from the amount Withdrawn by Sellers from any given online exchange platform at any given time?
Or is it a different part that you're saying I have wrong...?
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:04:18
What would you expect to happen...? I just don't understand where you think that money is going to come from
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:30:15
People like to say for every sell there's an immediate buy and that's what keeps these books in check, that's what really worries me... because it's the 'fund' and 'withdraw' operations on USD/EUR/etc. that really matter when it comes to keeping all this crypto 100% in check as easy liquid and no one is giving a second glance towards it after the exchange gives them simulated USD to be used for crypto trading while we leave that 'fund' money on the exchange floor with only what? A hug and a promise that the simulated USD can always be withdrawn for real USD and this whole time no one is touching the real USD?
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:51:50
Oh it's definitely not going to do that any time soon.. 
But on these exchanges sell vs buy is very different from fund vs withdraw
Buy and sell operations produce a minor amount of income for an exchange
It's the fund vs withdraw ratio where the real money is. Funding happens 100 times more often at 100 times more frequently than a withdraw and that means tons of money piling in the exchange.
An exchange at any given time has in its possession an amount of money to do with as it pleases equal to the amount of USD in everyone's account and it's an absolutely massive stockpile at this point. It's only getting getting bigger
They aren't regulated. They do as they please and we expect them to cut and run
This is what ponzi is..
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:51:05
The proof of the illusion I guess would happen when too many people try to make large withdrawals? Exchanges have no obligation, we all know they can just up and run, right?
localbitcoins isn't a very good system... coins aren't worth much if that's all there is
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:16:08
isn't that my point?
it sounds like you're saying you don't think a lot of $ are being traded at any given moment on any given Exchange? I figured in a billion dollar industry it would be a lot?
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:39:53
Okay, but it sounds like you've misunderstood my point completely..
the sells don't matter, that makes no difference to my point whatsoever
It's the *withdrawals* of fiat from the exchange that I'm saying matters entirely. That ability is what makes this asset liquid. It's also the driving force behind crypto's meteoric rise in value this year. I'm also saying that liquidity is an absolute illusion. From these discussions it seems that's being completely overlooked by almost all of you...
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:51:14
Well we're pretty confident in coinbase but even if it's legit.. The Russian exchanges? The Chinese exchanges?
They all have money pooling up at their feet that they didn't earn. Millions unaccounted for, all year long.. Every dollar unaccounted for that was meant for the Seller will not be going into their hands. The withdraw process will simply start to fail
That leaves a huge void of crypto floating around all over the world that can't be turned into fiat very easily.. Would have to use a system like localbitcoins
No legit exchange can fill that void
I'm not sure what you think im getting wrong here.. Are these not facts?
Which part seems wrong to you?
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:16:34
Well.. look at tradeblock.com/markets?
every exchange is on a meteoric rise.. far more buys than sells.... unless you're saying there's a withdraw procedure immediately for every sell operation in the exact same amount then I don't what to tell you
I was under the impression it was obvious that in most cases the simulated USD usually just gets spent on other crypto... after all it's hard to get cash into an exchange and it's more "valuable" there anyway because you can use it to trade for insanely deflationary assets compared to taking it out.... people leave it there in attempts to time the market, strategic buy back etc but that doesn't move the actual money anywhere. It's just sitting with the exchange the entire time
Is it not obvious there's practically no withdrawals being made in comparison to the amount of funding operations?
isn't the whole culture here about hodling?
I'm not sure why you would even try to argue this
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:51:59
Yes precisely
And I do not believe I have discovered this.. I believe a lot of people have. I just want to hear that you all are aware of exactly what I'm worried about and what your reasons are for not being concerned because to me it looks like a cryptopocalypse laying in wait
And by completely illiquid I mean high 90%
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:29:38
What has changed since localbitcoins is when a Buyer wants to buy crypto, a Buyer pays the Exchange. Not the Seller..
The Seller usually doesn't withdraw that simulated USD they got from the sell. The actual USD all stays with the Exchange. The Seller usually buys more crypto with the simulated USD they have
There's a stockpile of fiat gathering under every single online exchange platform. It's not buying or selling that moves that in and out of the exchange/into our possession like it should. It's funding and withdrawing
Serious funding happens a lot. Serious withdrawing *barely* ever happens at all
We all know an exchange can go offline on a moment's notice. That's why we all know better than to keep our crypto on it
But when the exchange drops off the face of the Earth, you think they aren't taking all the hundreds of millions of "worthless" fiat sitting under them? Any legit exchange isn't going to be able to pick up the slack when this starts happening
You seriously don't see a problem with this? It's a theft of hundreds of millions.... you're not escaping a hit like that even if you don't sell or withdraw or keep any crypto on these exchanges
People will realize the slight of hand these exchanges are pulling. If the convenience of today's crypto liquidity is nearly a complete illusion, then chances are insanely high that all crypto will drop in value to nearly nothing
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:17:21
No I'm talking about the process of trading bitcoins on more or less any online exchange platform
Yes the seller of course will get it if/when they withdraw it. But that is scarcely happening right now... Compared to those who are making Buy orders, the Sell orders are low and the *withdraw* orders and way way lower
This means exchanges would be stockpiling piles and piles of fiat that for whatever reason we're expecting to always be available to us even as if we aren't expecting them to get cleaned out at some point - without out it our crypto is far less liquid
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:04:44
Oh it won't happen... not until some of us decide we are so filthy crypto rich from hodling that selling a small percent of our crypto would net us life changing amounts of fiat money and we start attempting to withdraw. Not because we don't believe in crypto or anything... I mean more like when we decide we want to enjoy our crypto wealth a little and the world hasn't gone mainstream btc yet... so we'd still need to hope the exchanges have fiat in them
You know?
All that fiat that the Buyers dropped off and leave on floor of the Exchange each time they fund their account?
That's when, and only when, these problems would start happening
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:58:56
I get it
I respect that tons. plus your lifestyle decisions.
If you could not sell or withdraw fiat at all from any exchange you're saying it would not impact you or bother you. Then that's fine. It's definitely not the same story for everyone
But if that's the case for you then none of my concerns could impact you and I wish you all the best bro
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:00:01
Why would they? No one is selling bitcoins, except you apparently. it's too low in value
When they're higher, maybe in a year or two at $500,000 a piece you think exchanges will stick around with people really hitting them hard for their mega yachts etc. That money won't be there... you'll have to hope nice things can be bought entirely with btc by then
I'm thinking only virtual goods will happen
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:29:54
hrm... well when trading and you pull a Buy on some Seller's crypto, that Seller doesn't get $ in their hands. Those $ are still in the Exchange from when the Buyer funded their account
Every attempt to fund for a Buy went to the Exchange. Not the Seller. A Seller has to withdraw in order for it to be in their hands. The Exchanges will never part with their hundreds of millions of fiat that Buyers have been dumping into them this past year. Those hundreds of millions was for the Seller but it never gets there
This isn't theft?
which part are we disagreeing about over here
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:32:49
Okay, yes everyone is selling and buying but very little is being withdrawn from the exchanges... is that better?
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:19:16
The exchanges are just as bad then.. Worse because they don't allow reversals or guarantee security?
I'm just kidding. I'm sure we'll one day have better exchanges. But the current system is so ponzi. Even if coinbase is legit it can never fill the void of the world's illegitimate exchanges bilking everyone
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:25:48
Perfect. Any part in particular?
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:36:17
Okay... so the exchanges have pools of money that they'll never give anyone who wants to make substantial withdrawal. when that happens too much we all know they'll run
we don't care, we're smart crypto millionaires and we want our lambo. we kept our crypto off the exchange, we'll put a bit on another Exchange and try again
It'll run too
How much will be worth if we only have localbitcoins to turn our millions of crypto into fiat? it'll take a life time to sell that value of satoshi... and it'll drop in value from $8000 to $200 pretty quick if it can't be traded easy back to fiat like Exchanges are making it look
Does this sound wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:54:42
If as of tomorrow, you will not be able to any longer turn your crypto into fiat, ever, except for maybe with localbitcoins or something...
Would you be fine with that? Then if that's the case, all the more power to you brother
There's no concern I have that could impact you
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:57:27
definitely... but the value of bitcoin has increased a lot based on confidence of liquidity due to the services these exchanges are providing.. you don't see a dependency?
by "a lot" what are you picturing globally? 10s of millions? hundreds of millions?
I wonder if this link represents part of what we're talking about... 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:45:02
the legitimacy of bitcoin relies on the illegitimacy of every other competing coin.. otherwise it won't matter that there's finite bitcoin because there's limitless other cryptos
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:22:43
There's a real difference between speculated value and actual value... actual value is what you can buy with your crypto without relying on the exchanges who are holding all the $$ that you need in order to spend the crypto
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:19:41
Well I certainly wouldn't call bitcoin a ponzi scheme
But a typical Exchange platform? (not sure how Bitstamp is regulated differently from the others. I'll have to look that up)
If the Seller can't get *all* the Buyer's money during an exchange then a theft has occurred
That means whatever Exchange you're using absolutely must be sitting on hundreds of millions (typically, if they're big) and not be touching it... because they're not just matching Buyer with Seller as a lot of us like to say (for some reason), they're also holding *all* of every Buyer's money that was funded for an exchange in confidence and trust indefinitely for all the Sellers, only having to pay out tiny withdrawals possibly for years during this extreme deflationary period
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:40:07
We all expect them to. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when and it can happen at a moment's notice
I thought this was common knowledge
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:47:19
well.. a business supplies goods/services. in order to support those they need to pay for the overhead costs. unless all of that can be paid for in crypto top to bottom then sure otherwise it's need to be exchanged at some point into fiat
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:06:59
You're right, the quality of this stuff looks *okay* not quite AmWay level, but close
I'm just kidding. It's a pretty good response... I'm concerned about these businesses when the Exchanges get torn apart though
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:52:20
It's not the crypto we're very concerned about, we all know we take our crypto off the exchange as soon as we buy it for safe keeping. 
It's the fiat the Buyer was trying to give to the Seller in exchange for the Seller's crypto, that never reaches their hands... it all stays with the exchange only
and the Seller should never ever expect to get their hands on any significant amount of fiat out of the Exchanges.. They have a long time to plan and execute a good mt.gox
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:40:33
this is a pretty cool response actually
Wait... no lambourghinis?
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:44:28
I'm saying that when delving into this world of crypto, we should be fully expecting any Exchange to cut and run if it's money pool starts a trend of getting depleted and pull a mt.gox... no?
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:56:27
amazon has no interest in supporting crypto... you have to buy gift cards
microsoft business model is less risky because it's virtual goods, that's a good one though
i'm not sure i would spend millions on microsoft games though
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:51:10
I'm thinking about what you said. You may be right about greed keeping people from selling long enough for a high tech hail mary.... possibly with bank integration with blockchain... that would solve the problem I'm talking about with fund/withdraw as there'd be no need for the 2 functions if we have a sell order work seamlessly into our bank accounts... things just may turn out fine after all (the closest to it we can hope for). Right now, I'm thinking it's either that or we're all left with who knows what. with the recent initiative and interest banks have with integrating with blockchain it likely means government is now involved. hopefully they have means of throttling any withdrawal runs, they may even have this countdown under some semblance of control but on the other hand if they fail.. it'll be bad for everyone
I suppose trying to scare anyone is the worst thing that can be done right now... but i wouldn't personally encourage purchasing large amounts of crypto either. I guess people know the risks going in that they must only invest what they're willing to possibly lose entirely... there's nothing left to do but hope for the best and see what safety net the banks can provide if/when blockchain integration occurs. For better or worse things are out of the people's hands... seems clear to me we can't be left to just do this on our own anyway without help from banks and gov, not at this point
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:18:43

@_date: 2017-11-22 21:55:58
I guess you're saying you have full confidence in the Exchanges holding all the Seller's money. Letting it pool up in the Exchange's basement
That's perfectly fine with me if that's how you feel
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:35:25
So.. you're not arguing with me about any point in particular then...
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:37:00
One legitimate exchange isn't going to be able to fill the vacuum created by all the ones in the world that are pocketing Buyer money intended for the Seller. The internet will fill with black crypto fighting for liquidity and coinbase reserves would be devoured (if they aren't ponzi too... it makes little difference in the scheme of things)
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:34:56
I think you're confused about something
When a Buyer funds their account, they drop off that money with the Exchange. The Exchange keeps it indefinitely. The Seller never actually gets it..
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:47:53
So.. how do the exchanges work? They're completely unregulated... it's up to them to decide how they work
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:16:20
Listen.. I obviously can't open the vaults and show you whether they're empty or full of hundreds of millions that was intended for Sellers sitting there unaccounted for all year.. the Russian exchanges. the Chinese exchanges (EDIT: coinbase is the sole exchange with the level of hype around confidence and reputation for being the most regulated and trusted that I've personally been exposed to but that's likely due to my own visibility.. I'm under the impression Russia and China have the next largest concentration of exchanges and I may be misinformed that there aren't as many regulated as seriously... this is a global market. their business has the same direct impact and sorry if I offended anyone.. Russian and Chinese business people can be every bit as trustworthy/untrustworthy as business people of any other background. I'm trying not to be too ignorant of my own ignorance here... of which I'm sure there's plenty)
Any amount missing is not going into the hands of a seller when enough of them eventually try to pull a withdraw process and any legit exchange will not be able to fill the void of all the hundreds of millions worth in black crypto floating around fighting for liquidity.. It'll be a liquidity war started by the exchanges who decided to just suddenly up and ponzi on us
If you really believe that's not happening at some point.. That kind of trust and faith is not something i'd sign up for. If you're still in.. Go for it
But.. When I sell I don't want to also have to worry about withdrawing. There's no way I'm in, worrying about when to sell and buy sucks when it may as well have been zero this whole time.. but I wish you all the luck in the world man
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:07:38
I guess there isn't...
I only meant there are Exchanges that are very big and less regulated than coinbase outside of America... if I talk about exchanges in general people say coinbase is regulated like a bank and they miss my point. If that looks racist, my bad.. I believe all ponzi schemes are completely equal no matter the nationality
How all this will play out is not a definite possibly... there's plenty of factors to consider
Maybe I am making too many assumptions based on possibilities. if we take those out then what facts are we left with...
There are fund and withdraw processes..
Total Funded $ - Total $ Withdrawn = money pooled into Exchange that they didn't earn, nor was intended for them
It's difficult to get a lot of money in most exchanges
It's slow to get money out in most exchanges
It's more valuable to keep $ on the Exchange, crypto value increases are insane
Mt.Gox had $23 million being traded not counting crypto value
Exchanges aren't regulated and can disappear getting away with taking all of what's in it
I suppose the rest is where ever you decide to place your faith and trust
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:09:32
Nah... you sound confident you're not being taken advantage of, nothing else should really matter

Sellers take USD/EUR/etc. out of exchanges all the time in pretty small amounts compared to buy ins
money pools in big exchanges don't dip below hundreds of millions. exchanges were only meant to match buyer with seller, not hold onto all the Seller's $$ like some kind of trust
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:26:12
Yes that's exactly my point
if you trade with online Exchange platforms, then they take a, so b = 0 as well as c but everyone thinks they're all worth a and that's how it's presented to us
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:06:25
It's the fiat the exchanges are holding in good faith for the sellers who want to withdraw thats the real problem that's being discussed here. If that's gone, you guys can just go to a different exchange to try to make a withdrawal, if it folds then rinse and repeat. Any legit ones won't be able to fill the void created by the ones who decide they just want to take the money pool and go ponzi
unless the world takes bitcoin mainstream the exchange is anyone's only means of spending crypto

we know, this PBOC stuff is likely causing the dip and isn't crazy at all. It's normal stuff that has happened before and the dip is pretty normal too... This isn't the first time during the +500% gain in 6 months that it lost 1K in value because of a PBOC scare... there needs to be a real reason for a dip to be disconcerting.
Which is why, crazy shit not withstanding, I'm pretty sure that before the end of this year it will be at least $6000
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:14:10
well... I'm less concerned about the amount of buys vs sells/exchange value of btc, and more concerned about withdrawal operations. Selling for $ on the exchange is fine but if too many people actually want to *withdraw* their $ out of the exchanges we'll start seeing problems
the majority of that money isn't there, a huge chunk of those $$ was intended for the seller should they ever choose to withdraw but the vast majority of it these past few years has been just sitting in the account of these online exchange platforms, unaccounted for untouched and essentially no one's been going back for any of it. Those millions are far more than what any online crypto exchange platform makes from transaction fees... It all really comes down to how much do you trust an internet stranger to just carry around our millions for us this whole time while we trade crypto... I'm not sure what's fair. Perhaps 50% of these exchanges are just hemmoraging millions out into the black market laundering those $$ as hard and fast as they can, leaving us with the $ attached to our account and the assumption we'll be able to withdraw it when those vaults may have been empty for a while. Those exchanges would go belly up in a similar Mt.Gox fashion..? maybe they're also buying up the honest ones so they can do this to all of them?
With enough exchanges doing this, it would create a pretty huge vacuum... any exchange that pops up will be flooded with sell and withdrawal orders, there'll be no money in it and there'll be tons of bitcoin floating around for years that no one will be able to unload, like attics full of beanie babies...
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:04:58

Ty Warner's vision was for kids to have a toy that was unique, creating a finite number of each of them. As kids wanted specific rare ones the speculative cost sky rockets as parents struggle to find them. This caused an emergence of beanie baby traders... but that wasn't what Ty Warner wanted. beanie babies lost their value when Ty Warner declared that any stores caught selling over a specific limit to anyone will be considered aiding traders and will then be blacklisted from the supplier and just like that their price hit rock bottom and now some people have an attic full of worthless beanie babies.
obviously bitcoin is different.. it was meant to be traded
but if we're comparing BTC to Beanie Babies... then stores are exchanges, the most exchanges by far are in China and China can influence these exchanges by shutting them down.... This may not be the same "centralization" that bitcoin was made to save people from, but it's definitely another form of it. It certainly is enough for China to have almost Ty Warner level powers over bitcoin value right now and will be worse if it keeps up. Nothing happened to bitcoin value when Venezuela banned it, it lost no value and was simply driven underground.. It would be completely different if China tried to ban bitcoin
This should be motivation for them to keep it safe and not ban it as it's a powerful tool to charge up their own national currency. They would likely only ban if it was annihilating the yuan. Until then, market manipulation is the best choice for wielding that kind of power. It's also a risk because over time they could lose this power of centralization of exchanges as other countries get more bitcoin exchanges up and running.
Other countries need to adopt it (EDIT: by this, I mean that competitive high volume exchanges need to pop up outside of China). Ideally it would be adopted equally across the globe to safeguard against one country having a monopoly on bitcoin exchanges and taking advantage with market manipulation... But that's definitely what China has right now
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:25:56
what... imaginary fiat currency vs something real like btc?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:22:36
I think we compare it to a lot of things because it's a bit of a mix of a lot of very different things that we couldn't really mix together before but a big part of it is definitely ponzi... which tends to fall apart when people start valuing it more than national currency

This has happened every single time an established company mistakenly invests a lot of resources into an infrastructure that creates a product or delivers a service that has just been rendered obsolete. If they can, they will try to reach a good ROI before throwing in the towel and they will do anything to delay the inevitable for as long as possible to get as much returns as possible on their investment, including sending out as much misinformation as possible because it's one of the cheapest easiest way to slow the public's ebb away from their product

this dip isn't a result of anything anyone didn't expect to happen at some point as it's happened before and will happen again, this PBOC scare is even less impacting than a major exchange getting hacked. if it keeps going down it will be a result of something unprecendented happening like some kind of an attack on bitcoin that destroys everyone's faith in it.... but that hasn't happened. It went up to 5k, it will be back up there in a few weeks. 4500 was a good deal, 3800 is an even better deal because it likely will bounce back unless something crazy happens between now and then
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:39:05
by "other countries need to adopt it" I mean, entrepreneurs need to open exchanges outside of China with high volume and fees that compete with Chinese exchanges
Right now China has a monopoly on bitcoin exchanges as they offer 0 fees on trading which is insanely competitive. They only charge a low fee for withdrawing from the exchange itself, a cost which decreases based on trade volume
I don't see any exchanges in any other countries doing this... It's a good opportunity because obviously there's a demand and decent supply especially when China fucks with the exchanges like they are doing now
If we had exchanges at the level China has everywhere, China coming down hard on exchanges won't have such an impact on BTC value
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:33:38
i do... we need more exchanges in other countries...
nothing happened when venezuella banned because there are no exchanges there... we need tons every where for China to have no impact. right now they're creating their own centralization, not of bitcoin hash power but of exchanges which can be almost as dangerous if enough people lose too much $$ because of their fuckery

No one can name a single person in all of history who wasn't an absolute cunt, and this includes your mom.. Gandhi may have only been human (obviously) but his non-violent political protests that resulted in India's independence was mind blowing... he showed the world that with a little knowledge in law and if you can quell your inner douche for a bit you really can render most wars obsolete and win without fighting, peaceful resistance can be the most effective means of resolving geo-political issues when you're dealing with an entrenched authoritarian regime which is pinnacle should you give a fuck about human lives.

Okay.. But this world runs on fiat. You can buy stuff with bitcoin but that store will have to convert it to fiat to pay for its employees and getting more products unless they also accept bitcoin as payment.. But somewhere down the line the employees and other entities being paid in bitcoin will have to turn that into fiat as there's no fully closed system in any business model where fiat isn't required.. The online exchanges don't have that much money in them  as theyre unregulated, most are even pocketing large amounts of the fiat for themselves while people trade virtual fiat on the exchange that they won't be able to withdraw when people start trying to really cash in.. Bitcoin should eventually turn into beanie babies when no exchange will be able to stay up and running as people fly their crypto in to sell hard trying to get any money back

yes it's a social attack. we're bombarded daily with ads that claim the next ponzi coin is set to overtake bitcoin as the one true crypto. it's sickening.
no one has the ability to determine that except the majority of the public, because lets face it, it's all about those gains and who can get them to you fastest. assuming indeed there can be "only one" in this vicious debate, and there should be otherwise scarcity becomes little more than an illusion. it will be the public who decides and they aren't very tech savvy... in fact, the general public so non\-tech savvy that the "better" product be it performance on the things that matter most, fastest transaction times, lower unprocessed transactions, transaction cost etc. still will not guarantee a victor. it will all come down to marketing.
But a forked crypto does not mean it's illegitimate. the existing bitcoin protocol can always be taken over and become centralized and developed in nefarious ways. if it's taken a direction that's too against what people want it will fork and the people will have to decide. Yes this is what Roger Ver is saying has already happened but who the fuck knows unless you crack open the source code and see for yourself what people have been doing to it and pick a preference... listening to anyone insist on anything isn't going to illuminate shit because you aren't going to get anything but propaganda from either side
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:10:27
yeah but who gives a fuck, that describes any alt coin except that BCH had to fork due to disagreement on how to progress.. of course BTC will "win" through consensus because it has the name and anyone newbie coming in gets in through BTC. Pretty sure only the long game will tell and how many people are trading and value low fees and quick processing times, if one keeps getting unconfirmed transaction loads it may lose regardless of marketing

@_date: 2018-04-26 20:12:10
from what I remember, it was a disagreement on blocksize increase based on demand and that resulted in the fork so now we have 2 bitcoin and both insist they're closer to what the real bitcoin was supposed to be... some would say BCH because "it's closer to satoshis vision" but to an outsider it's all convoluted technical jargon bullshit, it can only be decided by the general public and we are, by and large, really not technically savvy so what will turn out to be the "real bitcoin" doesn't come down to anything but a propaganda war.. in other words, marketing. Even if the victor only works because of piles of duct\-tape and bubblegum. It doesn't even need to have faster transaction times, cheaper fees, lower unconfirmed transaction backlogs or all of the above... as history has shown it will be pure marketing that decides, more often the better product eats dirt because the other guys put their money into marketing and shadowy propaganda games rather than invest in a better product and compete that way
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:35:38
that's really just a matter of marketing, it makes no difference which entity is currently under control over the crypto most people consider to be 'bitcoin'
