It's a private company.  They had startup capital, and I believe they charge for classes.

And since pretty much all of the mining is going to be institutionalized, how is this decentralized?  The mining cartels are just going to take power away from Wall Street banks and become the new power to exploit the masses.

It's not a commercial site, so no budget for paid developers unfortunately.

LOL they delete everything related to XT within like 3 seconds

 Do you want to help us redesign  instead?  :)  We might need some help with tweaking the color palette for the forum.

Come help us with the new censorship-free Bitcoin Forum at [bitco.in](

Might want to check again.

He's not talking about people around the world.  He's talking about people in the Bitcoin community, who are much better at seeing through the bullshit than the average joe who's never heard of Bitcoin.

Except that most of that paragraph is an outright lie.  The domain is owned and managed by a single person, with the sole purpose of making money on the domain.

Here is the official *Ledger* [discussion thread]( maintained by the journal's Co-Managing Editor, and Scaling Bitcoin's star presenter.  :)

You realize that paragraph was copied in its entirety from bitcoin.org.  I suppose the entire team of writers, editors and coders participated in the copying?

Yes, forums, like Bitcointalk that has half a million users and is censored by theymos.

They're not upvoting the poster.  They're upvoting the information revealed in the transcript.  Who cares if OP was trolling or doing somersaults?  theymos still said what he said (which coincides with what he thought).

The site looks like a slightly more expensive scam now.  The only purpose of that site is to make money on advertising wallet services and leasing subdomains.
The "about" section is especially offensive, especially considering that it was copied word for word from Bitcoin.org: *Bitcoin.com is just one domain name used to promote Bitcoin. It was registered and is still managed by various community members, with the input of many Bitcoin communities. Bitcoin.com is not an official website. Just like nobody owns the email technology, nobody owns the Bitcoin network. As such, nobody can speak with authority in the name of Bitcoin.*
The domain is *not* managed by various community members.  It's owned and managed by Roger Ver who is trying to monetize the shit out of it.

These morons are claiming vote brigading occurred because this was also posted in r/bitcoinxt, where people supposedly use bots to hurt people's feelings.  So anything that's crossposted there is vote brigading now.

These people don't know definitions of common English words and they get to write subreddit rules... fantastic.
