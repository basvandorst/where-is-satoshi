It's not good for Bitcoin for a pro-censorship woke SJW to be this involved.  Mark my words: this will be a huge negative for Bitcoin long term.

Not sure Stephenson was a thing back then.

Never understood why commies would be involved in Bitcoin.  Why?

Hotel reform?  Get the fuck outta here with that shit

Last thing we need is a powerful SJW involved with Bitcoin.

One of the biggest IYIs in the space.
He talks a big game about humility and doing the right thing, but when it's time to do the right thing, he caves, usually because he wants to kiss ass and network (like with the Coinbase BCH issue which was clearly foul play).  
But he goes off on people who have no use to him like Parabolic Trav (and yes, PT was wrong a lot, but maybe Ari should pick on someone who deserves it).  In other words, he's a bully.

I'm amazed anyone could watch him and think that.  
He also has this other concept: ideological possession.

Not sure how you can be a progressive today--they're trying to do away with free speech, judging people by their race, deplatforming people, and being violent against people they disagree with.

Hacker News is correct-thinking, so they would not be banned by Paypal.

I don't think most modern-day Bitcoiners realize how powerful a force Tim May was in the financial cryptography / cypherpunk worlds.  He inspired thousands with his vision of technology enabling freedom.  No longer would you have to convince the masses that freedom is good--rather, just build freedom with technology.

I don't think they haven't watched him.  I think they're ideologically possessed like this woman:
I think they listen to him but their brains are so fried by progressivism that they hear what they want to.

Gab is still centralized.  Someday, maybe ten, maybe twenty years from now, it will also eventually be taken over by power-hungry progressives.
