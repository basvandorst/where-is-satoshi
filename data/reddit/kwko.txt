Anyone can create a Node at reasonably low cost yes.
To connect to that node you must open a channel with it.
This requires an on chain transaction.
This is expensive.
More nodes doesn't change this problem.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:00:39
Non hub channels to whom?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:21:59
To open a channel you have to make an on chain payment. Thus you will not have a channel to every individual, you will hop through hubs to make a payment. I believe it is clear that this will cause centralised hub structures to develop over time as it will result in the cheapest fees for users.

None I require for my argument (though there are some such as free advertising via word of mouth etc)


  
Coinbase's hub will have lots of users so users can build their funds securely and deposit into coinbase at Los fees. This means I can connect to any of their customers if I have them as a hub immediately connecting me to a huge set of people,all for one tx fee.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:34:01
Ah thanks. Yeah haha I assumed they meant Europe generally (as opposed to the USA)
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:31:53
They can't change the on chain transaction fee which is the fee I'm taking about. (I'm assuming the lightning fee Is basically zero)
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:18:08
It costs one on chain tx to open a channel (and one to close which we will ignore for now). Users will want to pay for as few of these expensive on chain transactions resulting in users connecting to well connected hubs so they can hop via the hub to pay another user. These well connected hubs will connect to other well connected hubs forming a small group of well connected hubs. If new hub pop up, why would anyone join it rather than one of the popular hubs?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:59:01
Lightning will only reduce the on chain transaction fees if the takeup of lightning exceeds the adoption of bitcoin (on chain). This is almost impossible to predict. I don't think its a given. 
  


  
Except - no one would know if a node was going to do this until they did, or were forced to. 
  


  
Do you see a flaw in my reasoning regarding users wanting to connect to the most users with the least fees?  
  


  
I am asking questions because I want it to work. If I didn't want it to work I would be doing other things. I just have my doubts which is why I have been trying to understand more. 
  
  
I think my main issue is that I like on chain transactions, and I am not convinced that on chain won't work. I also am suspicious because any time this type of question is asked there is a deluge of people trying to divert conversation or saying that the person asking is FUD'ing.  
  
Thanks for taking the time to respond.

Exactly, furthermore you are still using the amazon hub, you are just one step further from it. If these hubs are an issue this isn't a solution as you as as affected as your friend of the hub is compromised.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:08:06
The difference is, in order to switch I have to pay the expensive on chain transaction to open a channel. If this is prohibitively expensive I can't afford to switch away from coinbase. If, magically, everyone had a channel established with 5 other people at no cost then I would agree, however this system needs to grow from 0 nodes upwards. Given this, and the fact that it is expensive to transact on chain, I belive people who are opening a channel so do so with a well connected individual rather than a random person as it minimises the number of channels required - reducing fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:57:13
So... Is does take two transactions to open and close a channel as I said. (opening is paid for by the person opening the channel, closing by the person closing the channel to settle). This means as few channels are desired by all parties in order to reduce their fees. 
Do you agree the user will want to open as few channels as necessary, as will the node operator. 
To connect to any one of those thousands of diverse nodes requires an on chain transaction. To switch to another node (or add a backup node) requires another on chain transaction. Is the on chain transaction is prohibitive (which increasingly looks to be the case for most of the world) connecting to one node will be costly, let alone multiple nodes.


Because to close the channel (to settle up) requires the node to make an on chain transaction. If this is costly they will want to minimise the number of on chain transactions, thus will they not rather connect to a large hub so the amount being settled is larger, this the proportion of profit spent on on chain fees is lower?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:00:18
1) you are not competing with absurdly expensive on chain transactions, you are competing against all the other payment methods in existence. Just because it's cheaper than a $10 on chain fee doesn't mean anyone will want it. 
 
2) if there are hubs through which most payments are routed these can be shut down by a government or other bad actor. Then everyone would have to move to a new hub (costing huge amounts if on chain fees continue to rise) which the bad actor can again target.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:29:31
why would anyone connect to a randomer rather than a hub. The chance that the randomer goes offline is far higher than a very profitable hub.

I've responded to the question. Please help answer if you believe I am wrong. Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:47:09
Not really what I mean. My argument is that if the incentive is to minimise the amount spent transacting with other users via the lightning network (which it is) then implicitly the incentive requires minimisation of the number of on chain transactions needed to connect to all the users you need to transact with. With lightning you can pay someone via some other address you have both got open channels with. The result is that in order to minimise the number of channels you have to open (thus, to minimise the number of on chain transactions, thus to minimise the fees you pay to open channels) you will connect to well connected addresses (addresses which have many open channels with other users) which will form these addresses into hubs.

@_date: 2017-12-21 02:38:08
You pick who you open channels with no? The addresses you open channels with are what I'm arguing will become hubs as more people open channels to the same address to allow them to connect to the others connected to the hub. As I explained, you would as its the way you can connect to the most other users for the lowest fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:52:06
It creates these points through which transactions must pass. If a malicious party controls enough of these hubs it would be difficult to combat and would require everyone to pay on chain fees to move to a new hub. This would repeat each time a hub is compromised. I think this is another attack vector.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:49:37
Please read my explanation in the discussion under my comment. Lightning eliminates those centralization concerns, that doesn't mean it can't add other centralization concerns.

I'm taking about on chain fees. Please re-read my message and let me know what's not clear.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:12:18
Thank you for your detailed response, lets continue :) 


  
Adoption can be universal and reach 100% of existing and new users if done with a hardfork, for example if BTC hardforked to have twice the Blocksize tomorrow.   
  


  


  


  My point it is that 'they' are the malicious actor who is co-opting nodes and shutting them down as they become critical to the network ('they' are not a single node operator). If nodes keep getting shut down everyone using that node will surge on the chain to move to a new hub.   




 &gt;LN fees will tend to the marginal cost of operating a Lightning node.  
  
I was talking about minimising the on chain fees required to open channels to connect to the network. No amount of node competition will help here.   
  


  
None of the core developers who control the github merge requests have said that they want to increase the blocksize. More broadly some bitcoin developers (thinking of LukeDashJr) want to reduce the blocksize. If they wanted to increase why would they not have supported Segwit2X?  
  
   


  
Why not? Why is this so obvious to you? Are you 100% (not 99.999%) sure that blocks need a size limit enforced - or would miners mine blocks that are small enough that the system remains decentralised enough to satisfy enough people that their blocks are not rejected by full nodes. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:02:15
If my employer is Google then yes, they are a centralized hub. If my employer is not... Say they are a small aerospace firm, What other nodes will they connect to? Random individuals or other centralized hubs for say aerospace manufacturing industry.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:03:11
Yes you could, but you would have to pay the on chain fee to set up a new channel (and I believe, an on chain fee to get the outstanding balance on the old channel back but I may be wrong - if anyone knows please let me know)
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:29:10
Lightning is cool, but I still haven't heard an explanation as to how to avoid centralized hubs whilst requiring few on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:03:34
Thank you for your reply, I agree, there are better ways than the way used to verify that you are in control of an address, not sure why they wanted it done this way. I will suggest your ideas. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:56:17
If the user has to open another channel that costs fees (on chain transaction fees are necessary to open a channel). People won't do this unless they have reason to, hence payment will flow through hubs not from user to user to user to user etc.
 
My point it that this will stop the network growing into the layout your expect (lots of nodes connected in a mesh) and will instead make it hub and spoke.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:39:39
The addresses you open channels with are what I'm arguing will become hubs as more people open channels to the same address to allow them to connect to the others connected to the hub. Apologies for the confusion.

If the hashing algorithm has switched from SHA256 then yes, you are correct, it is difficult to compare. I imagine you could attempt a comparison in terms of FLOPS (though that would be quite hit and miss). It does raise the question, can bitcoin ever switch to non SHA256 hashing because the 'longest' chain cannot be compared between different algo forks.

If someone found your credit card I presume they could spend a lot of money.  Similarly if someone finds your seed they could do the same.  
  You could split the seed into 2 parts and store one (labeled part 1/2) and the other (labeled part 2/2) in two separate locations. That way if they found one they wouldn't be any the wiser.   
  
Online is never going to be as secure, however I would suggest   
*  writing it in plain text while running a clean os from a live cd in private  
* encrypt the file with a memorable password  
* upload it to a new google drive account with 2F authentication enabled with Google Authenticator and tell no-one this account (just use it for this one thing).   
* Make a note of some backup/emergency codes for your 2F in case you lose your phone. 
  That said you need to keep your Google drive account information and encryption password secure and you will probably do this on paper so you have just moved the problem along a bit.  
Hope that this helps.

I understand it to be a way to avoid having to pay transaction fees every time you transfer money between 2 or more parties through off chain transactions. Only one (the most recent) transaction is signed and then treated as a normal transaction.

If a European Parliamentary Law was passed then the implications could be dramatic as many european nations would be implicated at once. Imagine 6 european countries each had 10% of the hashrate. Each are far below the 30% concern limit you set thus according to the metrics you provide there is not an issue, however a single regulation change could compromise 60% of the network.

@_date: 2018-03-28 07:57:50
Fair enough, I think there might be a small number of people willing to do this - the difficulty is how they find each other. I’m struggling to imagine a product that doesn’t take Fiat to create in some way.   
  
Consider a handmade hat is going to need wool, which has to be farmed, treated, coloured and shipped. Each part of this process is currently done for fiat so each one of the actors providing these processes would have to be willing to do it for BTC. This will be a hard sell as they in turn have suppliers who don’t accept BTC.   
  
The alternative is that someone buys wool in bulk for fiat and resells for a fixed price in BTC. This is all well and good until the price changes such that either 
- this person is not able to buy sufficient wool with the fixed amount of BTC they get from sales (because Fiat buying power of BTC has dropped)   
or   
- the hat maker struggles to sell their hat for BTC because the hat is overpriced relative to Fiat (because BTC price has gone up).   
  
Fundamentally the issue is the consumer who, while earning a wage in Fiat, will struggle to rationalise buying items at a fixed BTC price if it is poor value for money in comparison to selling their BTC for fiat.

I am still developing a rugged method of determining what my definition of Bitcoin is. I am trying to understand how others define Bitcoin so that I can collate the best answers. If you think Bitcoin is done forking then you are going to be surprised, it is clearly the easiest way to cause community infighting and will undoubtedly be used against us in the future (if it hasn't already) by malicious actors. For this reason, attempting to clarify how vocal community members define the 'true' Bitcoin after a split is crucial.

It's how you determine which of the consensus following chains to follow (the chain with the most cumulative hashpower).
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:12:17
Miners are incentivised to ‘do the right thing’ otherwise other miners will ignore their invalid blocks and they won’t get the block reward. No non mining full node is needed.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:01:32
It doesn't make me uncomfortable. You are completely missing my point. I **agree** with you, it needs to be a decision made by everyone. This is why I am surprised when you say just follow the crowd, it misses the point that consensus requires individuals to act according to their own rules, not just follow like sheep. 
 
 &gt; Follow the people. Where are the most miners, the most developers, the most stakeholders. What do they call Bitcoin?
This (your initial response) doesn't describe how consensus is formed. It just describes how to follow consensus once it is formed.

This is a proprietary system designed by apple. It is basically another way of paying with fiat. If apple wants to they can give every user some credit, but they would have to spend the same amount in $ to do this as they would be giving away in $ equivalent because they cannot just create money.   
    
It is for this reason that it is not really a major competitor for bitcoin.      
  
bitcoin does what it is meant to very very well. Things need working on (how to get store and pay with it) but it is fundamentally different to all other monetary systems. Once bitcoin is commonly accepted by major retailers, which I believe will happen, it will be inevitable that paying for things will be as easy (or easier) than it will be with the apple watch.   
  tl;dr if apple pay is the candle, bitcoin is the light bulb. They might not seem immediately different as they accomplish almost the same end result from a customer perspective, but once the other advantages of the light bulb are seen, it will vastly supersede the candle.

thanks again. The use of the word wallet finally makes sense, unbelievably it hadn't clicked that a wallet is for amounts that you would carry in your wallet. And that cold storage is the equivalent of a normal savings account.    
What is a "proper" **offline** solution?   
Do you know of a website that tracks open source bitcoin projects? Because ideally I would like to use some software that i can download and run offline, which is opensource (to ensure its legitimacy), which lets me manage my private keys as you mentioned and, critically, has been around for a while, as although there are loads of systems that meet my other requirements, there are relatively few which have been around enough for me to have faith in them. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:24:40
thanks, i guess the obvious question is, why not for cold storage? and if not mycelium for this, then what? I have read extensively about different methods although it seems there is no way to be 100% confident that your cold storage method secure unless you create everything yourself (including the hardware). There are so many different options its daunting.

For me the fact that you can buy low volume with a **credit card** is great. I think even if it is an 11% premium on, say, a £30 order it is perfectly acceptable for a lot of people who want an easy, simple, safe way to get involved with bitcoin.

How do you know which chain is bitcoin. Say you went into a coma and 30 years later you wake up - how do you determine which fork is bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-30 19:02:11
Thanks for taking the time to reply.  
 


It certainly would to me if I woke up after a 30 year coma!   
  


To you perhaps. I, and many others, care about the chain being valid. The issue is determining which chain is valid as you haven't been around to watch consensus ebb and flow. If you tried to enforce the rules as they were before you went into the coma you would likely be operating on a network which no longer had consensus and would be an alt-coin.   
 
 
 &gt;vagueness is something you have to deal with      
What happened to "The longest chain with the most work is what matters"? That was very specific! I joke but how can you have it both ways? My point is to try to explain my belief that Bitcoin has no definition you can point to after a long time away from the network. I would love to be wrong - hence why I made such statements (people are bound to reply with counter-arguments!).    
  
I agree. Sorties paradox is an interesting comparason. As is the concept of the very similar Ship of Theseus.

You have previously said:


My point is that even If we were at a point where all the transactions in new blocks are legitimate we would have a transaction price issue in that the 'legitimate fee' increases continually. Why would you not want to allow more transactions per block in this scenario?
Edit: To clarify I am aware that you do not agree with those who believe there is no spam in bitcoin (if it makes it in it block that Is) however I implore you to consider my argument which is presented in the situation where there are no spam transactions in blocks due to eventual (inevitable) transaction fee increases.
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:34:07


  
What if the majority of users and miners had wanted to change this rule? Would that not make the conclusion you draw from this point inaccurate? 
  


  
Please can you explain what you mean - interested to hear more about this because I haven't heard this view before.

Hi Luke, I have a question :
Imagine 100% of bitcoin transactions were ‘legitimate’ and were p2p payments for tangible goods/services (not ‘big business’ or ‘spam’). In this scenario there will be people paying a below market fee who cannot get their transaction included. 
If they raise their fee to a ‘sufficient’ level the average fee is increased, and someone else’s ‘legitimate’ transaction can no longer be included. 
Your proposition that they just need to pay a ‘sufficient’ fee does not hold up once everyone is performing ‘legitimate’ transactions. By your logic the fees can increase, and increase, and increase and eventually price everyone out excluding those wishing to send transactions for a $1000 fee. 
Now yes, if there is demand and limited supply those at the top of the fee ladder will be happy as they are paying the ‘sufficient fee’ however everyone else, even those wanting to send transactions with $100 fee’s are, according to you, attempting to make transactions that are not ‘legitimate’ as they wish to pay below the current market fee.
What is my flaw in logic? I'm Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:40:40
Why should nodes control the network? Then it's just a race to control nodes! Bitcoin is a hashrate race, always has been. To think you can change the metric by which consensus is reached (from hashrate to nodes) is to not understand bitcoin imho
@_date: 2015-10-24 22:08:15
Fantastic insight! Thanks for that. The first mover advantage coupled with the network effect means that M-PESA has a good foot in the door. Furthermore M-PESA can be used from basic cheap camera free phones can be used over very cheap competing mobile operators which is something which bitcoin simply cannot do. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 13:05:59
As stated in the article it is interesting to note that BitFury (the mining company)  acquired Allied Control (the immersion cooling company).  
  
 This upstream acquisition allows BitFury to cut out the profits that would otherwise be needed by Allied Control in order to continue. By doing this they reduce their fixed cost of cooling and gain a competitive advantage over other miners who may not be able to use processes that are patented by Allied control. 
  
  It will be interesting to see how other mining companies react and if they too opt for an upstream acquisition strategy.

I guess its somewhat chicken-egg. My point is that nodes alone shouldn't be used to force protocol changes in this way (UASF) because they can be spoofed whereas hashpower cannot. Nodes may enforce rules but if a majority of nodes attempt to enforce rules that a majority of people don't want, (rules which reject blocks created by a majority of the hashpower) something is clearly wrong, no?   
I was quoting the whitepaper :) 
@_date: 2015-10-26 20:47:59
This needs to be higher
@_date: 2015-10-27 13:50:21
No, when you send bitcoin to someone there is a transaction fee that goes to the miners. It is currently far lower than that charged for international money transfers by companies such as Weston union (between surviving countries) but Is not actually 0. Eventually the Bitcoin protocol will eliminate mining and the transaction fees will be the sole 'reward' for those securing the network and as such transaction fees are expected to rise.
@_date: 2015-10-28 09:20:22
Interesting point that about 1% of bitcoin volume is spent on mining
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:04:54
Miners will never intentionally mine coins that nobody wants. If miners are choosing to mine with certain network parameters it will be because they see that others see value in that network under those conditions. Am I wrong in thinking that historically all bitcoin protocol changes have been achieved by hashrate consensus?

Thanks for your reply.
    
In your original reply you said "a few of its blocks are too big to be valid (they break the blocksize limit rule)", my point was that you cannot know what the rules will be in the future, thus when waking from a coma you cannot look at the chain and say - "this isn't bitcoin, it breaks old rules". As you correctly point out without a majority you get two chains, are you therefore claiming that it is miners who determine which of these chains is valid? If miners don't have the right to decide which is the main chain, what is wrong with using a difficulty adjustment. I don't mean for the BCH case, I mean for the general future case. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 20:10:04

I guess technically if they are only receiving then they don't have to pay any fees, but if they want to use that bitcoin they will be the customer and they will have fees.

1 stock - (minimum investment) $100   
Even if they are going to do all that they say they are (which would be incredible if unlikely) how can they expect a minimum of $100 investment at this stage. 
  That said it's a very interesting idea and I wish them all the best. If I could trust them and had $100 spare I would probably invest
 However I don't, and I doubt many people do

My current opinion is that ultimately Miners dictate the network rules, and that their decisions regarding these rules reflects the will of the people using bitcoin. I agree that the will of the people is not currently being reflected in the network rules (we all want scaling of some sort) and it is tempting to think that this is because Miners don't want to allow scaling (because it might decrease short term profit) but I don't think that it is because of AsicBoost or attempts by miners to maximise fee's by having limited block space.  
 Check out these posts on why ASIC boost isn't a big enough reason to explain miner behaviour.

 I think miners are waiting for the Bitcoin ecosystem to reach some level of agreement regarding potential scaling solutions and don't want to be seen to be taking control from core. They are clearly currently at some level of consensus because our network has not forked. Some miners may not want to voice an unpopular opinion for fear of being thrown under the bus with Bitmain?  
  
edit: I should highlight that disagreement with BIP148 does not necessarily equal Disagreement with Segwit. See [Here]( for a clear explination why someone may not want BIP148 whilst simultaneously desiring Segwit

If they control a large proportion of the newly minted coins the number of coins already in existence is not important. The reduction of new coins entering the market world presumably reduce number of coins being sold and  therefore push up prices. Other people already holding coins may decide to sell as the price increases which would counter this effect.   Eventually, when no one else is left who wants to sell at that price the price would rise until someone is willing to sell... Eventually if a large proportion of miners stopped selling the price would increase. Although the ability of miners to work in this fashion would undoubtedly trigger selling of bitcoin by those who would be worried by the power that the miners would have on the price of bitcoin.

It is exciting to someone who has watched this unfold. Even when I first got involved with bitcoin in early 2013 this was unimaginable.  
  
 I have seen a steady increase in the image of bitcoin, from scam to gimmick, gimmick to niche, and now the start of niche to mainstream.    
  
I have seen the price rocket and crash, taking some people to space (virgin galactic tickets) and leaving some people broken.
  
I have watched as the big financial institutions have shifted from treating bitcoin as a ponzi scheme and a joke to accepting that blockchain technology is revolutionary and will change entire systems within society.  
  
I know bitcoin is growing,  
That is why I'm so excited for the future

If you can afford to lose it, and can afford to wait a few years before it regains its current value you should do it, put most of it in cold storage and the rest in a secure (backed up) mobile wallet like breadwallet.  
  
 If not, be wary as there is no guarantee that it will be worth anything tomorrow, however unlikely that is.

This was the miners reaching consensus. The *miners* signalled to inform each other and minimise risk of a fork (generally believed to be bad for everyone though I'm starting to wonder about that). It was the miners that reached consensus and upgraded the network, not the users.  
  


  
 
Source on that? My understanding was that it was not as significant as that.
  
  
How do you account for the remaining (non segwit signalling) miners?   
  
edit:   


  
They can do this by mining / buying mining contracts. Hashpower is the only metric that is valid for reaching consensus. What's stopping anyone from firing up 100,000 nodes signalling that they will only accept X protocol? Not much. Hashpower, on the other hand, can't be faked.

If you are serious about finding a wallet.dat file there are some things to know
 *  If anyone has that file they may be able to access your coins. DO NOT SEND THE FILES TO ANYONE 
*  Back up the whole hard drive, preferably multiple times.
* find all the wallet.dat files 
* download bitcoin core 
* import the first wallet and export your private key
* repeat for all wallets
*  keep these private keys very secure. 
* ideally you should do all of this on a computer that isn't connected to the internet. An easy way to do this is to use a live USB
