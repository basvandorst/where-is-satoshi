I admire the boldness of people who at this point make a complete switch to Bitcoin, especially as a store of value. I think it will pay off handsomely for you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:54:21
good for you. I think spending your BTC is just as important as saving it. I would suggest keeping a small portion though. We're going for a million or bust. You don't wanna be on the sidelines.

running the latest Bitcoin Core release
@_date: 2017-02-19 11:06:58
Just set up a node as well with a Raspberry 3 and an old external drive, was fun to set up and I'm doing my part in supporting SegWit.
@_date: 2017-02-20 10:47:20
We definitely need more competition when it comes to mining hardware, regardless of the scaling debate.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:21:00
my thoughts are that the Core development team has zero to do with this sub.
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:41:17
gonna need an updated version of this:

Bitcoin's market cap right now is still miniscule in the grand scheme of things (granted, it more than tripled since that info graphic was made).
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:43:39
I used a combination of these guides:   
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:54:26
Possible, though not likely in my opinion for the same reason we still use TCP/IP, SMTP, etc. At some point, it was easier to just build on top of these protocols instead of reinventing the wheel.
I think we will see the same thing with Bitcoin. Layer 1 will eventually be static and the innovation/competition between solutions will be on higher layers.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:00:30
completely agree, this sub also has a bias no doubt but the amount of upvotes this thread received alone shows that this community is still open and able to reflect.
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:37:55
same, Raspberry 3 + external hard drive: 
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:28:07
indeed, I think they bought in at under $10 and never sold (at least according to them).
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:08:56
* He's still optimistic about activation within the 1 year timeperiod after signaling reaches a tipping point. If not, the devs might have to come up with a different approach.
* No viable, well-tested alternatives to SegWit right now, pressure on network has to increase further to stop the stalemate.
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:24:07
It's a reasonable concern for miners, they need to break even on their investments in hardware but blocking L2 is shortsighted. L2 will happen, it's too useful not to and is needed for greater scaling. With that comes more adoption, more fees (miners might get a smaller piece but of a bigger pie) and more returns from block rewards via increases in price. I guess the problem here is uncertainty, the miners don't have a guarantee on this happening.
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:15:06
agreed, I would 've already started mining if it wasn't for the crazy electricy prices here ($0.3/KWh &gt; Approximate ROI = never).
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:25:20
I think most Core devs see HFs as risky but another good point that Eric Lombrozo recently made in a debate is that if you're gonna hard fork, you should get as much stuff in as possible which can only be done with a hard fork and not just make it about increasing the block size. I wouldn't mind a separate blocksize increase after SegWit but I think it should be further down the line so more changes can be included and tested.

Agreed, not many people do what they do in the Bitcoin space. I think their work is not as appreciated because the Bitcoin community generally looks down on the dinosaurs of the financial system that the twins are trying to integrate Bitcoin into.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:58:51
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:49:27


  
I switched to a Segwit UTXO but I think the big numbers in terms of early Segwit adoption have to come from exchanges, casinos, etc.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:00:12
Look at it this way: If you're in it for the long haul and think there's a decent chance Bitcoin will go mainstream, you already own enough to be set once it does (depends on what your standard of living is I guess).
I would suggest dollar-cost averaging for your future Bitcoin purchases but do a split between ETFs (MSCI world for instance) and Bitcoin to have some diversification. Just my opinion though..
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:00:03
Right, it would be too easy to just activate Segwit, focus on Lightning and have btc easily sitting at 5k by the end of the year with more stable innovations on the horizon. Let's deploy a client which no user will run and which will not be maintained by most, if not all Core developers. Let's deploy an unstable hard fork which will further confuse newcomers and scare off smart money.
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:04:40
I would like to know what reasonable NYA supporters think would happen after the 2x hard fork. Who is gonna maintain that client? Certainly not any of the Core contributors. Good luck deploying Schnorr signatures, MAST or any other major improvements.  
Bitcoin Cash is at least consistent in that they removed the Segwit code and prefer a dumb on-chain big block version of Bitcoin. But if you in any way see the benefit in Segwit and the extremely talented developers behind it, you can't think that a hard fork which is not supported by those same developers is a good idea.
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:55:17
pretty much, you can expect more nuanced discussions when the bull run is over (whenever that'll be). Personally, I get all the interesting Bitcoin news/developments from Twitter.
@_date: 2017-01-14 12:22:44
I have yet to find a fully automated solution for doing this (Purchases of XBT after SEPA transfer AND automatic transfer to an address or cold storage). I know Coinbase has recurring payments, unfortunately buying is not available yet in Germany.
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:22:18
agreed, I always tell people to do their own research and not take my word for it.
@_date: 2016-11-13 23:40:36
have to agree. I want Bitcoin to succeed as much as the next person but this guy has no credibility.
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:49:16
could be worse ... 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:51:37
I only recently noticed how much worse my Twitter addiction has become since I got into crypto. Last weekend, I decided to completely stay away from Twitter / Reddit / coinmarketcap. Best weekend I've had in months. Unless you're a trader, I can recommend to at least avoid crypto news / prices on the weekend.
@_date: 2017-04-03 08:54:43
yeah that has been bugging me too. There's this false equivalence where people make it look like it's a 50/50 split and like both sides are equally right/wrong. People wanted a blocksize increase (not unreasonable), the devs found a way to do it without hard-forking. In a perfect world this is already the optimal solution that gets everyone on one page.
@_date: 2017-04-18 09:37:19


This. Blocksize increase via Segwit + L2. If we hit a wall again, blocksize increase via HF still an option (+ other "HF-only"-changes).
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:07:01
or in video form: 
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:04:11
A path forward is not clear so I wouldn't count my blessings yet. Personally, I think the market should be punishing (the miners) some more, I don't really care if that makes my bitcoins worth $200-$300 less for a while.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:01:32
I think that is more of a counter-argument to people arguing that we need a blocksize increase right now to alleviate high fees but to be fair, the mempool could be filled up (probably with spam) again in a few weeks.  
  
My biggest concern would be that there's no Core developer who would support the client. Let's say 2x is a success and becomes the reference client. How long until an Unlimited-style network failure, who are those top developers that will implement Schnorr signatures or MAST? To paraphrase Trace Mayer, you don't want the JV benchwarmers working on Bitcoin, you want the allstar team. I'm just amazed that the businesses supporting 2x don't see the problem here.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:47:03
This is from the (sybil-resistant) Coinbase survey:  
  
Most people are fine with an eventual blocksize increase, but if we're gonna hardfork, it shouldn't be for just a blocksize increase (get more HF-only features in) and there should be plenty of testing / preparation.  
Here's the link to the survey:
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:14:51
it's a risky strategy but to be fair:  
-This has never not worked out in the history of Bitcoin, considering we very recently broke ATH again  
-If you're gonna go into debt, now is not the worst time with interest rates being so low  
-If he has a steady job and is independent, he can easily pay it all back within a few years

Was already excited about some serious competition from Japan but them making their own chips and those chips being 7 nm. This is some fucking great news.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:59:06
Crazy to think that Vinny argued against the Unlimited fork / miners at the beginning of the year.
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:39:25
I feel bad but I have to disagree. These days, it's as simple as buying a hardware wallet, writing down the seed and safely storing both. Ledger or Trezor, very userfriendly.  
Even if you go with a Linux distro on an airgapped PC, you can find dozens of tutorials walking you through every step. So you have to be willing to either invest 80-100$ for a very user friendly solution, or an old PC and some time for a less userfriendly one.
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:29:26
I can't even imagine what that must feel like coming back to your PC and looking at an empty wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:01:40
I think that is too drastic atm. The centralization problem will improve over the next years imo with GMO entering the space with 7nm ASICS. There will be more competitors catching up to Bitmain with diminishing returns in Moore's law.
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:34:23


This statement really nails it. BTC is sound money, actually worth saving unlike Fiat. Bitcoin as a savings instrument is and will remain one of its best use cases imo.
@_date: 2016-10-19 13:56:23
We must be somewhere in the middle: 
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:10:40
yeah, I only listed the ones that still have day-to-day functionality (i.e. making transactions).
@_date: 2016-10-13 10:07:57
@_date: 2016-10-07 23:14:04
some scenarios to go along with that &amp; other potential values: 
@_date: 2016-10-28 07:31:56
according to this article 
the current extension is 90 days (started on October 12th), with a 60 day one after that.
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:04:08
next deadline is January 12th, last one is March 13th.
@_date: 2016-10-12 10:17:28
SEC staff can now extend for another 90 days. If they still don't decide by then, there's another 60 day period where the SEC's commissioners can approve it themselves. That's public office for you.
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:39:29
If someone quotes Satoshi when it comes to the decentralization, permissionlessness, scarcity and privacy of Bitcoin, I can see it eventhough those are nobrainers. But when it comes to technical details, it's indeed nonsensical to refer to Satoshi. There are so many unforseen circumstances in 8 years... if Satoshi was still actively working on Bitcoin, I'm sure he would 've changed his mind on many details.

@_date: 2017-05-17 21:05:09
If the choice is between never activating Segwit or getting Segwit alongside this nonsensical hardfork, I'll take it at this point. I think eventually we would do a raw blocksize increase, though I would obviously still prefer it to be alongside other "hard fork only"-changes to make it count.
Either way, developers who can actually evaluate this solution need to see if it's realistic.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:24:35
such blatant posturing.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:08:36
Thing is though, we can't rely on people to behave and not spam the network. Fees mitigate it now, hopefully we'll have Schnorr signatures at some point to change how the type of transactions utilized by the spammers are handled and mitigate it greatly.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:33:50


Yes, I have no doubt that the Bitcoin protocol will eventually ossify and developers will work around inefficencies on higher layers like we have seen in the past with other protocols. But it's too early for that imo unless you really only see Bitcoin as digital gold.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:12:04
fixed: 
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:21:50
The other side of that bet is a nobrainer. If you lose, you can pay off the bet with your btc-fortune.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:26:37
The most interesting part about it to me is the difference between  
1. I oppose a block size increase hardfork at this time (majority agrees)  
2. I oppose ever increasing the block size limit with a hardfork (majority disagrees)
