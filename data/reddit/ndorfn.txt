DCA? Should i just put 500 In a day from now?

Haha cheers. Just because you inherited the money doesn't mean you can afford to lose it. Think about the head start you get on life if you put it towards another investment. 
If it was me if go half in now.

 Am i correct in thinking i can only put in 500 a day to coin base then bam.... put the whole lot in?

I'm a noob too. I've been researching and studying everything on the net for the last few weeks and the best advice ive learnt is..... invest what you can afford to lose. If you drop 90k 45k 20k 5k.... picture yourself without it. Then make decisions based on that mindset.

So how do I start out with DCA? Just buy a small amount each month? Or do I buy a large amount now and keep purchasing throughout the months?

Unfortunately yes. "Everyone put their hand up who didn't buy in the dip and is waiting for another dip "
Puts hand up*

If you get coins on the other chain, what will happen to them in regards to growth and value.
I'm trying to learn more but everything thing i read is confusing. FOMO is the reason everyone is investing?
