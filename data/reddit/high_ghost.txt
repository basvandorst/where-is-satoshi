You being able to divide a dollar into 100 pennys doesn't make a dollar not a dollar. The market has decided that one agreed upon unit of bitcoin is worth around $4500. Im not sure that I understand your argument

Science progresses one death at a time
The same is probably true for economics. It's younger generations over a period of years/decades that will make cryptocurrency truly mainstream money

If everyone keeps their bitcoin offline in wallets they control (own their own private keys) then fractional reserve banking is impossible, unless there is a peer to peer lending system (obv w/ no financial custodian) people could put their money into. I wouldn't even call that fractional reserve banking, I'd call it fractional reserve hodling ��
I agree there's massive opportunities with credit, and to be honest I'm surprised I haven't seen more startups in this area. Luckily with the blockchains ability to store and authenticate data, lenders will have magnitudes of greater insight into a potential borrowers relevant financial history. Distributed reputation systems also have potential to help with this issue.

Why is it that every 25 years or so everyone forgets that the world can change? I love watching people like this interviewer who sit there with their egos and skeptical expressions trying to throw darts in new ideas because it doesn't fit in to the status quo. I guess some people are just born innovators/early adopters and others born skeptics. Glad I'm not on the latter end of the spectrum. 
This is awesome though. Thanks for sharing
