I did have a MtGox account. I’ll check through my old email account and see if anything comes up. Thanks for the idea.

Thanks. It’s super frustrating cuz I have old emails asking them for my coins back or to let me log in and withdraw them but that’s from back in 2013. I don’t think a company can just shut down and take everything in it’s wallets and not give ppl their BTC back. It has to be somewhere. Keeping it is theft.

I found an email from me to tradehill asking that they return the coins I had in my account when they shut down. That’s the last I heard from them. Seems like my best lead.

I can’t find a date on that article but they do say they never lost any costumers money so maybe they still have my BTC. Seems like a long shot. 
Is that what you were trying to say with the links?

Ok I️ give up. what’s HODL...?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:22:08
That’s what I️ mean... nothing on there is still viable...

Haha thanks for the translation. 
What it’s like being the only one you know who owns BTC.
Dood - “Hey do you still have your BTC?” 
Me- no
Dood - oh that’s good man it’s at $xxxxx now, you should totally sell now! 
Me - you said that at $xxxx
Dood - yeah but now... it’s so high now.., you should sell now

But how?! I’m an old school GpU miner that wound love to get back in the game but it’s crazy now. I️ have some cash to invest but don’t want to just donate electricity usage for the cause.

I looked to see if it’s there and it was. I tried it with my wallet that only had 2.75BTC so I would mess something big up. I just tried to send it again but it said it was already sent. I emailed Bread support right after I sent it to my own bread wallet and they said it’s in my wallet but not accessible as of now. They also refunded me the transaction fee. Just curious if there were any Word of them fully supporting it soon so I can dump them.

Thanks. I’m quickly finding out how little I know about this stuff now. I’m an old school
Miner that pulled a coin every few days back in the duel GPU and megahash days. Lost some coin to MtGOX and had the rest I’m cold storage for years now. It’s changed so much.

They are 5%?!?! Yeah that’s nuts. They are loosing site of the whole point of cutting the middle man and fees. My dad is finally deciding to invest (I have been working to get him in since 48¢/btc) but he’s pausing because he keeps finding 3-8% fees if you buy then sell. He’s looking to do $50k so it’s hard to swallow. This is honestly one of the biggest holdups for companies trying to “accept” btc. 5% is way to damn high for businesses/larger investors to accept. 
TLDR - 5% sucks they are killing retail uptake with the fee creep.
