It's open-source so you can see for yourself what the devs are up to -&gt; 
Version 1.0 was tested in the past week &amp; apparently it worked but there are definitely still issues to resolve.

Trezor is good because it allows you to have multiple wallets, each with a password (in addition to the PIN number). I think it's a better choice than Nano S.

On that link you can see when things are "committed" (changed or added) to the code repository. You can also look at the 'Pulse' which is like the activity ... there are consistent commits, last one was 16 hours ago:

You can keep your Windows &amp; use it how you normally would. Dual booting is better while you're learning because you don't get completely cut off from what you already have (gaming, photoshop, browser setup etc etc)
Here's a guide, you can skip down to the "Existing Windows Installation" heading
It's best to read the guide before starting &amp; then pull it up on your phone while you go through the process. Do it methodically &amp; you'll be sweet. It's really not hard but like buying Bitcoin, the first time is a learning process.

You know about LN and make a VCR/DVD comparison while claiming ignorance as to why Bitcoin is the highest value cryptocurrency. Hmmmm........... elaborate shitpost?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:29:37
I don't agree with that. From my understanding the reason the 1mb limit remains is because increasing the block size is a short term solution and eventually would make running a full node outside of the capabilities of people with low budget.
Eventually block size will be increased but since it's only part of the long term scaling solution it's being delayed until the rest of the solution is ready.... in the form of Segwit &amp; LN apparently.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:13:22
The project is open-source so you can see for yourself. The most recent update to the code that I can see was 2 hours ago

Yeah I dunno, seems like they gave themselves a lot of wiggle room in that statement.

And confirmation times. It needs to be milliseconds like everything else on the internet. Anything more than a few seconds is unacceptable.

Bubble is a traditional term associated with price being too high whereas Bitcoin's price is still being discovered. 
There's no doubt that it's eating into gold as a store of value and gold is an 8 trillion dollar market. Bitcoin has yet to break 1 trillion so there's an argument that Bitcoin is still heavily under-priced.
The argument FOR it being a bubble is the large amount of new investors coming on board through sheer speculation, looking for quick gains without understanding the technology. That's straight bubble mentality. Doesn't necessarily make it a bubble though.

8 years is actually a long time for software to be ready for global adoption. How long do you think Spotify was under development for?
It's the difference between a corporate structure where deadlines etc makes sure stuff gets done and an open-source structure that makes sure the best stuff gets done.
I'm saying this as an advocate of open-source tech, a Linux user &amp; Bitcoin supporter but also a realist.... I hope this tech survives &amp; naturally becomes a valid currency trusted the world over but do wonder if competing with corporations &amp; governments is possible. Linux can't compete with MS/Apple, not when it comes to adoption &amp; acceptance.

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:38:58
I don't understand why Bitcoin as an investment is even relevant. It was never designed to be an investment. This is one thing I agree with the BCash people on, it's supposed to be a digital currency. The idea that anyone in the world can quickly &amp; cheaply transfer value. It's pretty close to perfect IMO but just not ready yet for global adoption... the scaling debate has been a known issue for years and yet it has not been solved. Can you imagine a Paypal-type corporation dropping the ball this severely? Dude if their developers fall a month behind a crucial deadline heads roll.
I'm not advocating for anything here, I'm just saying that the nature of open-source software is .... I guess frustrating? compared to commercial where you can just hire in the skills you need and hold people accountable for things like deadlines, communication/PR etc. It smooths things out &amp; gets results.

Buy a trezor. You'll sleep better at night once your investment is backed up in a recoverable hardware wallet.

How much time have you put into researching Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:03:23
Some perspective...
BCH launched at 0.15 BTC
BCH is currenty 0.18 BTC after a 60% gain in 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:52:58
I spent a couple of hours last night looking over the Github repos just to confirm my assumptions that there's much more activity &amp; of a higher quality on the non-bcash camp. The last activity I saw being discussed by the devs of Bcash was the logo colour. Some are 100% trying to replace Bitcoin and some are trying to establish their own brand. It's funny &amp; sad seeing developers doing marketing.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:19:46
Haha awesome man. Nice work.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:37:20
Golds value isn't from its utility it's because it's pretty and we like it and so we placed value on it thousands of years ago. It's still pretty to look at. Never oxidizing is probably it's best quality.
We put value on bitcoin for a few reasons, some are negative in that it represents removing power away from those mother fuckers in high finance and politics who collude.

Thanks a lot, I agree but could never write it so clearly. It's true for any business, being too busy to meet demand is rarely a bad thing.

No because if Bitcoin fails I think it'll spark the end of non-government-based cryptos. It'll likely be all they need to bring in the central bankers to sell it as "safe crypto" and the masses will go along with it because let's face it, most people would rather feel safe than be free.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:38:20
So they invested in LN but haven't done jack about rolling out Segwit?

No BCH has an extremely small group of developers who have made terrible decisions eg. using the same address format as BTC.

Global currency running in parallel to a mix of other currencies, both crypto/fiat hybrids &amp; pure cryptos. Whether Bitcoin will last until this happens remains to be seen.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:03:18
If Bitcoin falls then crypto as we know it is finished. We'll get FedCoin thanks to the short-sighted partisans over in Bcash land.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:10:34
I hope you're right although Segwit would help ease concerns about transaction cost &amp; speed so it's a bit of a worry they're dragging the chain. I guess they believe prices are likely to increase more without Segwit and like any corporate entity they'll look after their bottom line before anything else.

No worries. I'd say Ubuntu 16.04 is probably a good choice because it'll have updates until about 2020. There's one small trick with Linux, you have to edit a config file to get the Trezor extension to work but the instructions are on their website &amp; will popup when you need them.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:49:34
Resize your windows partition &amp; free up about 10-20Gb, install an easy Linux into that partition by way of install CD or use Rufus to create a bootable USB. Update the Linux. Buy a Trezor. Install Chromium &amp; don't login to Google. Install the Trezor extension to Chromium &amp; put your BTC in there.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:44:20
If you believe in the technology, no amount of PR spin will change a thing. Bcash's strategy is seriously flawed. People don't want to invest in counterfeit coins. They want the real thing.

I can only speak for my country, New Zealand. The government here has taken notice of the volume and is enacting laws to tax home owners more if they rent out using AirBnB. In effect, AirBnB is a tax dodge here. If thethse types of regulations happen in the major centres I don't think AirBnB's future will be as bright as some anticipate.
