Big fucking whoop, I can't believe this post has so many upvotes.

That's not entirely true, there is a project underway to make a blockchain resistant to quantum attacks and it has some really great minds behind it.

I'm sorry your brother killed himself but it wasn't because of bitcoin, it was because he got caught up with a fantasy about money which he couldn't grow past. It was greed that killed him.
If it was really about bitcoin, he'd be happy the tech is a success, not be upset because he missed out on being rich.

Something about tx capacity and POW being completely retarded stops bitcoin from being what it was supposed to be. It's all hype now because the info is doom.

Every other post? what a load of bullshit, there isn't a single post in the top 50 about this.
This is just a post convincing people to HODL so you yourself don't see a lower low.

That doesn't make sense, how can they execute trade orders before confirming they have the BCH?
Are they guaranteeing those trades regardless? What if they don't receive the BCH, what happens to the other half of the order?

He's talking USD, not BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:47:55
No, you adjust it relative to how you always determine the price, relative to every other currency.
What OP is saying is that if you took that $10 then, purchased a basket of currencies which represent the relative value of the USD in 2015, then sold those currencies back for USD today, it would only be worth $9.68

I don't think you understand bitcoin at a fundamental level.
Attacks are super easy to perform, you connect to 10 nodes, all are spoofed attack nodes, now you're part of the attack and you have no idea and no way to know what is real.
This is how an attack on a blockchain works. How else would it fail otherwise?
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:40:18
so you made your cold storage into hot storage? 
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:50:36
Your node doesn't validate all the transactions, just the transactions since the last snapshot. How can you trust that the snapshot you've received is real? Snapshot fork.

You might not be planning on or able to leave the country, so you're stuck with the BTC and can't sell it.

Yea that has nothing to do with this situation, in fact, it's the opposite. The image is much faster than loading all the resources from a webpage.
What point are you trying to make by posting that image anyway?
Edit: I think maybe you don't use RES? You know we see the image just by clicking a little plus by the post title right? RES is going to blow your mind pleb.

I'm curious that you haven't worked it that when you spend bitcoin you just buy more and you still have the same amount PLUS you've helped the utility of bitcoin which increases it's value further.
goddammit some people are stupid
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:54:08
Don't be silly, that is not a reason to avoid spending BTC. The price could just as easily have dropped and you get it at a discount.

Goddamn you mother fuckers are stupid.
Here's how it works.
1) I have 0.5BTC, it doesn't matter when I purchased it.
2) I want to buy a laptop that costs $500.
3) I buy $500 worth of btc, then I buy the laptop.
I still have my original BTC and I've contributed to BTC in two ways:
A) By purchasing more BTC  
B) By making a payment in BTC
What is so difficult to understand about that? and why do you idiots insist on believing that when you spend BTC, you can't replenish it at the same time at the current market rate?

What a horseshit post.
Bitcoin is fucking stuck dead and at this rate other crypto currencies will very soon surpass it in usability and usefulness.
All you have to do is look around us today to see what tomorrow will bring. Bitcoin should be much higher than it is but it's broken and stuck and it's shit. It will not be a good store of value once other currencies surpass it.

Please don't participate in the us vs them debate. No matter what happens nobody wins with a divided community.
@_date: 2017-05-03 01:02:23
Why say such things, there are many facets to any discussion but you've just decided that this particular aspect is the main one.
This sort of absolutist commenting is just what the community doesn't need. You don't know shit boooooy and you should keep your assumptions to yourself if they aren't balanced and don't contribute.
@_date: 2017-05-03 01:03:12
No, they just made a bold, one dimensional assumption that you happen to agree with, please stop with this nonsense, you're not contributing anything so don't say anything.

I have to say I'm disappointed that bitstamp isn't at least crediting, no matter how you want to spin the altcoin story, this is the biggest thing to happen to btc in a long time and they should allow users access to that fork. It's not insignificant.

If you truly want to support bitcoin, that's exactly what you should do. Just buy more bitcoin you idiot.
I never understood why bitcoin users act like spending bitcoin is bad, fuck, not only do you get to spend bitcoin, but you get to buy more, support usage and increase the value of bitcoin everywhere.
Morons you are I swear to god.
