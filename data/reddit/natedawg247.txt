A literal cess pool. I sold 2 days ago literally on speculating comments in this sub. People are insane, and dumb af.

Thank you, as an economist I'm glad someone here understands some basic principles.

Yeah I mean maybe holding is fine too, I personally don't see the technology being fixed for a long while to come. But definitely don't make this an argument with her.

Why couldn't it go down by $100 20x. Or get halved 20x? I don't understand your statement I see no truth in it... Sarcasm?

I'm not trying to troll or start a major argument but this is a fundamental flaw with viewing Bitcoin as a currency right now. On one hand you have huge faith in Bitcoin, evidenced by the fact that you own a btc Debit card. On the other you are actually spending those Bitcoins on things every store would accept USD for. Your actions are at odds with each other. Every time you do that you create a smaller version of the $50mn pizza, you're way over paying for no reason. If you believe price will go up, it's irrational to make purchases with it when USD is accepted just as easily, unless such a high portion of your wealth is in btc you're not stable enough for day to day purchases
When this dynamic changes, btc will truly have made it and take over as a currency.

The block chain can only handle so many transactions per second. The desire is for billions to use it. So there are super high fees and transactions take forever. Literally sending $5 to another wallet costs you $30. The technology is not there.

Which is why everyone thinks it's a bubble exactly

With the new tax bill that past you're also paying less in taxes next year depending on situation

Anyone who thinks Bill Gates doesn't know exactly what crypto is and especially the tech side of it better than 90% of this sub is delusional.

I dicked around on coinbase for two weeks (early december so i got very lucky) and realized ~$700 in gains. I was fully planning on reporting this in my taxes but finished my taxes with the intention to come back and add this, but didn't realize once submitted I had to wait for my refund and there's a complicated process to amend your taxes.  Is it worth it to go back and report this?
