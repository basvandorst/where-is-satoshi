They haven't but they don't have majority market share to lose either.

Wait, Ledger stores Dogecoin? I never knew this! 
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:00:41
Rereading this, I actually have haven't I? Sorry!

It's never been hacked like ETH has and it's trustless and decentralised unlike XRP. That's where I see the value of BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:39:24
Bitcoin has never been compromised for almost a decade. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:45:31
Two wrongs don't make a right and this sort of shit is... Shit.

Perfect aphorism. Everyone dies there's no winners in this.

It's not necessarily a negative, it's a very nice problem to have. In business you fight for market share and when you have a majority market share like Bitcoin has, you've got everything to lose.
Depending which market space you operate in 60% (arbitrary number) market share is ridiculous domination, that actor can't can't get anymore MS is can only play defense.
With a market space as competitive and fast moving as cryptocurrency right now, every % you lose it's going to be extremely difficult to get back. A few years ago this wasn't a problem there weren't many coins. Now if you lose a Bitcoin holder, it's because they've (literally) bought into the competition. 
Every coin is gunning for marketshare and top spot. Bitcoin must give a very compelling message to stay there and importantly attract new entrants to the Crypto space.

Caught my attention but I can't even get past this title...

Bittylicious is a little more expensive but their service is fantastic. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:13:50
So all you get is a bigger fire.

Are you an online store? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:25:27
Bitcoin just took some preworkout. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:18:37
What are the win conditions? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:20:13
Cool graphic what am I looking at? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:36:26
More than likely this is covered by anti money laundering regulations. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:07:43
The picture from is not a pretty one either...

Some friends of mine report that Barclaycard is declining transactions too - Coinbase and Bitstamp.

On on phone's keyboard I just press the �� button! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:00:54
Make sure you finish with ������
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:44:09
The problem though I can see is that Bitcoin isn't competing against just fiat anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:26:13
Nah man, if I'm selling in selling for Monero. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:18:01
Trezor already supports Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:43:30
Can you get burned by Binance if you don't store any coins there? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:06:24
I'm not selling! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:53:58
Bitstamp for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:29:28
I see the anonymity as a utility. I don't really see the point of Cash. Bitcoin still has plenty of opportunity and options.

And then someone handed him a crisp 100BTC note.
