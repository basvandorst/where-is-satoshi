not sure of your point. my main point is that the 'free market' didn't actually solve this by moving away from ghash as posited by andreas. my secondary point was that I have faith in people like andreas and his peers to sort this out.

I think Andreas is a great guy and he has a gift for talking about hugely technical things in an understandable way and I think what he said was right BUT that's an old video and the part where he said the market reacted and moved away from ghash proved only to be a temporary thing. 
I am confident, however, that so many bright minds are invested (not only financially but that helps) in bitcoin that we will get a solution to this issue sooner rather than later.

Well if you look at the april 13 bubble you could say we've just had another (may) when we went from 400ish to 600ish. I suppose it's your definition of bubble. I say you can only call it a bubble for sure after it bursts. We seem to be surge and correct rather than huge bubble and crash.

They ship internationally
Is it they won't ship bitcoin orders internationally? (I haven't tried as I'd be screwed with duty charges)
Edit: I see this "The Pay with Bitcoins option is only available for orders placed on our US shopping site. This payment option is not yet available on the Mobile or International website versions."

I'm a publisher. I run ads and I use abp. In fact, in the past I've troubleshot my adserver before realising I was blocking my own ads.
Publishers, you can't just expect people to automatically pay or tip you. You need to make it a call to action.

Oh aren't you great. Why should I crowd fund some guy wants to be a helicopter pilot when there are people starving to death every day?
If you want to crowd fund something you need to give something in return otherwise it's just begging.

The next robocoin (or robocoin from this point forward) will just have to be more professional. You can't sell a product and then provide it late and faulty no matter how many lawyers you hire.
I'm glad the op got restitution, hope other customers did too but mostly I hope it helps robocoin up their game to the point of being a serious, professional organization. Good luck to everyone.

I posted below but I'm a publisher who runs ads (and abp) but makes more money from paid subscriptions. You'd make more money running ads saying "Please consider donating or buying a subscription to bitcoinblog.de as without donations we will not be able to keep this site alive!"
Very few of the filters will block your inhouse site ads and you will get donations. You have to ask and ask again. There's no shame in it.
You have no right to think that people want to pay for your article no matter how good. People will invest in the future though.

I presume bitcoin has discovered the cure for cancer, ebola and aids hence the huge crash. All we need now is for the blockchain to end poverty and hunger and we'll be down to single digits.

Agreed. I'm no apple fan boy but if I had known I was able to buy apple giftcards for bitcoins 6 months ago then I'd have a mac. I run a website and I can make an android app for users but it's very difficult to make an apple app without a mac.
That said, I'm thrilled as I wasn't aware of the company as a bridge to buying stuff off amazon.co.uk

localbitcoins is by far the best way to buy/sell to people especially if it's cash.I only know from a selling pov but I went into the whole thing super paranoid and despite my worst fears everything went great.

There are far less notable people on wikipedia. They started their own pages, edited them over the years and have never come close to being nominated for deletion. Ironically it's only because Andreas is notable that they want to remove him.
Lots of other notable people have been removed too.

I wish you Ƀ people would fuck off tbh. It seems like you want to make bitcoin as obtuse, confusing and odd as possible. 
Nothing personal. It just grinds my gears.

I think we'll see some surges but overall you are right. Interesting that you are getting criticism for advocating sustainable growth rather than bubble/bust/bubble/bust characteristics.

This ^. Also just talk to them. I've had accounts temporarily frozen in the past. They are reasonable. What I imagine they will do is make you upgrade your account to business. I did the same when I first started doing volume.

I recommend localbitcoins. I've had money transferred into my bank within minutes. There's also plenty of people buying for paypal/cash etc. Just find someone who has built up plenty of trust and you'll be fine. I was super paranoid before I used it but it's been absolutely brilliant.

Short term he may lose but longterm he will gain. e.g. if he as a business has 100 bitcoin @ 650 then spending 1 to prevent a price collapse is good business.

I posted above. I'm no apple fan boy and own no apple gear but recently I had the need for an apple to compile an app and couldn't. I wasn't aware of your service at the time but had I been I would have a mac and a compiled app.
Honestly, as the small guy you can still be the bigger person by not taking these stances.

Ok maybe I should clarify that I'm not discounting the fact that bubbles occur and probably will again at some stage in the future. I just think bitcoin has become a lot less volatile.
Just on momentum, we had weeks in the 400's then rose but we didn't keep rising in the bubble-like way we've seen before. We surged then corrected and now we're seeing stability around 600. we didn't get the bubble.
It's all speculation though.

Yep. I was a customer there and initially lost bitcoins but to his credit he didn't just abscond or make excuses. He fronted up. He's a young chap but compared to some of the absolute cons by so called mature/serious players he showed a lot more integrity than most. Kudos for that imo.

There was already a widely accepted symbol.

I'd honestly prefer they charged transaction fees than this month charge. I think they are probably bringing this in because most of their clients do $0 per month.
I was going to push a client into accepting bitcoin but explaining that he has to pay even if he makes no bitcoin sales won't be a something I'll be able to sell him.
I suppose the starter 1% might be a decent option tbf. It's less than paypal or cc.
