Hey rahan12, thanks for the information as well as the questions.
Part of the reason i haven't posted an address for the wallet containing the 1.337btc is id clearly made a mistake with the separation into multiple wallets, these wallets are not cold but my main one is which has a substantial amount of coin within it and Ive been trying to sort out this issue as technically the keys dont match the cypher's anymore that's why id said before i was willing to gift the coin to anyone who can solve the allegorical story instead.
Also the rate at which btc continues to drop is forcing me to consider selling off and re investing in other Crypto Currency or at least spread the risk abit as when i bought it was pretty low, To add to this im a busy man and feel this was maybe a bad idea, i mean i wanted to re invigorate the bitcoin community as interest seems to be diminishing.
Im willing to take down the challenge till problems are corrected but which direction i take with the rest of my coin is yet to be decided...
Please let me know what you think, as i really do value the community opinion!
Thanks Mate

Thanks rahan, im going to see if i can contact a friend of mine talk the situation over with him, ive been recommended to sell off and reinvest in gold/bonds as i decided not to sell at the peak, like i stated the amount of coin is considerable and i need a holiday quite frankly! 
Thanks again ill keep the post long enough to get across the outcome and revisit this in a bit...

please read the later comments, my intention wasn't to waste time and still isn't also this was more a contemplation about a conversation i had with a friend about the rate of decline, along with taking into consideration of the bigger picture, sadly i believe in bitcoin id bought in mainly for use with silk road, the cypher's worked just fucked up a critical aspect and like i said ill most likely rework them later... somethings cant be foreseen, would i have done this again... absolutely, the advice and clarification of where i went wrong was worth understanding!
Good Luck Pete...

The coin's are kept in separate cold wallet's, Ive decided against revealing all public addresses, as id like each decrypted cypher to result in the gifting/transfer of the separate wallet &amp; seed phrase, along with a public congratulations!
Ive been concerned about hacking also which has caused me to take this route, as a precautionary measure.
Although I'm a proficient Cryptographer, I'm not a Cryptocurrency expert, this will also be a learning experience for myself.
I'm going to see if i can organize it to be simpler, but it works for the meantime.
Thanks for the question, I hope that made the situation clearer!

Hey Majestic_12inch, Ive played cryptomancers, antichamber and myst series seriously great games, dont know about the word cloud puzzle but sounds interesting.
The Cypher's aren't all that complicated, the key is to remember that there is two separate parts of the puzzle, one is the allegorical story and the second is the private key if you solve one you will be able to solve the whole cypher. Just a little hint for you, "they are linked together in a particular way";P
The use of Glyph's aren't Sumerian but somewhat inspired by hieroglyphs and euclidean/Pythagorean geometry, also a little mathematics...
Thanks for the message mate :)
Good Luck

lol close but no cigar!
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:12:02
Hey robbiethegiant, I would say first step to identify patterns, understand how the glyph's are constructed and remember that there are two  sets of riddles that make up the cypher, one the allegorical story and second the private key!
Thanks for the Question Mate :)
Good Luck

Thanks Hlost123, It took a considerable amount of time to get it working correctly, along with making it look great!
Thanks for the comment Mate :)

Hey ili-lil-ili, it probably agree with you but you never know if you dont try.
Ive considered giving away the bitcoin even for partial/allegorical decryption... 
Not sure yet will have to wait and see how people get along with the challenge!
Thanks for the comment Mate :)
Good Luck
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:52:33
No Problem, I'm super exited to see if anyone will get them cracked and how long! 
"Psst their not impossible to decipher, just an unusual encryption"...
Thanks for the comment mate :)

Please refer to the Quick update...
Thanks mate :)

Hey FizzlePopBerryTwist, Interesting experience thankfully i'm no G-Man looking to hire anyone just trying to create something rather unique and exiting along with giving people an opportunity to prosper from there efforts!
Thanks for the comment Mate :)
Good Luck

You've got the right idea just wrong image, the main blood moon image isn't a cypher...
The center symbol has an allegorical meaning though, and is present within the Q cypher...
Considering your efforts so far ill give you a useful hint, the symbol of the face with hypnotic eyes has an allegorical meaning akin to "FOCUS" meaning to focus on the big and small to derive full understanding...
I'm super exited that your getting into it, thanks for your efforts mate!
Good Luck

Hey Drinksbeerdaliy, You sure can!
Thnaks for the question mate :)

Hey skandicek, thanks for the nice comment, im really grateful to be-able to share my work with the community along with improving my skills!
Thanks again mate :)
@_date: 2018-07-29 07:34:24
Hey chimnado, We share similar interests :) In order to decrypt either of the cypher's the first step to identify patterns, understand how the glyph's are constructed and remember that there are two sets of riddles that make up the cypher, one the allegorical story and second the private key!
Little hint, the riddles are linked in a certain way!
Thanks for the comment mate :)
Good Luck

Totally Escher's fractal works along with his unique take on surrealism are some of the greatest artworks of all time!
Ive been really into Jung's works as well my favorite book is man and his symbols. also work checking out Camille Paglia's early works, they give a brilliant insight into literary history along with myth and archetypal meaning.
Ive heard of the Berlin clock as well but haven't looked into it much, its definitely a unusual piece.
Thanks for the comments!

Thanks for linking to the word cloud puzzle, ill definitely have a crack at that :)
As for your question, yes each cypher has both elements, although they are linked. 
Thus if you can decipher one you'll be able to solve the puzzle along with gaining insight into my unconscious experiences as well as a considerable amount of coin!
Yes each cypher has a separate linked cold wallet, in total there 19 cypher's in all from 2 Series Cosmic Coalescence and Electro Glyphs.
Over the next few years, ill release all the cypher's in the chance that none of the cypher's are cracked and btc is still viable ill donate the proceeds to an early education project! 
I haven't decided to give the coin away for partial/allegorical decryption!
Thanks for the Question Mate :) Hope that helps clear up things...
Good Luck

Hmmmm, Cant answer the first question without killing you ;p, as for Dr. Peterson everyone is going to have an opinion on him but i'm referring more to the Archetypal Mythos which is as old as civilization itself and was unpacked by Carl Jung long before Dr. Peterson, so i hope you can see past his politics and look to the deeper meaning...
Thanks for your message mate :) 
Good Luck

Hey Moodytomatoes, I'm very happy you like them they will be available to print in the near future as they are technically rather large and unique artworks, the encryption is solvable and not all that complicated just unusual the important part is to remember that its two separate riddles, one the allegorical story and second the private key. Solve one, means you can solve the whole cypher!
Thanks for the message mate :)
Good Luck

Thanks majestic_12inch, The Cypher's are also full size fine artworks about 36x48in in the future ill make some prints available but you can print them out for yourself if you'd like...
Dont know whether you've heard of M. C. Escher but a lot of his illusions really made its mark on my when i was growing up, for sure influenced my work!
Thanks again for the comment mate :)
