There once was a Guy who downloaded and uploaded the same image again and again. He did that so many times resulting in the image turn black.

Thanks Bud! Yes this is Vray too :)

Design and animation by me. Made with 3DsMax.

It’s from Binance

I would really enjoy making some sort of cartoon animated show, but time is the main issue for now. This week i will make a Bitcoin robot in a Artificial intelligence style. Will be a cool one too for sure.

Imagine the shipping costs ��
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:45:59
Once you know how to do it it’s not That hard.
@_date: 2019-04-24 08:06:55
This one frame took about 3 hours (suprisingly long) to render on a decent machine. I’ll might do a animation in the future though.
@_date: 2019-04-22 10:40:03
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2019-04-24 09:37:17
We can put our fiat in there.
@_date: 2019-04-27 11:00:26
That’s generous, will keep it in mind. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-04-24 09:12:49
Yes you can ��
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:38:06
Will do when they start running.
@_date: 2019-04-21 17:23:14
Yes the link for the HD phone screensaver is in the comments. I dont have a landscape version unfortunatly.
@_date: 2019-04-21 17:16:46
 here you can download the HD iPhone wallpaper
@_date: 2019-04-21 19:34:52
Yes, Absolutely ��
@_date: 2019-04-23 21:04:16
I searched for it and understand why. Thanks for sharing your POV. That makes the world wiser. :)
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:28:22
Yes that’s right! :)
@_date: 2019-04-26 13:42:14
Excellent! I’m building this digital [forest]( to do something back for the mining impact on the environment. Have donated 250 USD so far for new trees.
@_date: 2019-04-21 14:35:43
I used 3DsMax for this scene.
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:44:48
Thank you! Have been tweaking them for a while :) however these settings are more suitable for animated scenes i think.
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:44:23
I have Not tried C4d yet.
@_date: 2019-04-23 22:12:59
[WeTransfer]( Same quality but includes a HD screensaver version for you to grab.
@_date: 2019-04-21 13:51:01
Absolutely nothing! But it is art and can be used to create exposure for BTC. Its Just a marketing perspective! Thats all i_gotta_say.
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:33:44
Thanks! The rendering setup took me about one hour to get right. Vray is definatly worth it indeed.
@_date: 2019-04-24 09:39:34
Twitter.com/Tokendesigner Will do. I don’t have a website yet.

There is something coming out this egg today or tomorrow!
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:32:43
Actually, i will render a phone sized one and take out the fog, That will do the trick.
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:47:29
I’ll ask crypto bunny, i saw him placing those eggs there.
@_date: 2019-04-23 22:17:35
Yes those are the basic rules for animating too. This bull is about to perform a u-turn.
@_date: 2019-04-24 08:04:13
@_date: 2019-09-18 13:06:10
All bulls are drunk atm
