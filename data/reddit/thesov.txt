thats what i was thinking too, but how could we verify those transactions were on the up and up?

umm, its not laundering unless someone is fraudulently creating bitcoins. once they all goto 1 address any person recieving them from there will still be logged.

treat bitcoins like actual money, leave it on the same system that u use to browse the web and play games is like leaving 500,000 in your ragtop jeep. is cash not ready for the mainstream?
your bitcoin transaction machine should be as hardened as where you would keep your cash. i use a virtual machine thats on a truecrypt volume. i unlock the volume, start the vm, let bitcoin catch up to the network, do business, wait until my wallet is updated, shutdown, dismount, backup.

as cool as i think bitcoin is and encourage its use to prevent control of currency markets, fiat currency is fiat currency. if bitcoin's creator turns out to be a pedophile or something you can be assured its value would drop(at least temporarily) based simply on that.

thanks for the lesson i didn't know that. i was under the impression fiat meant based on nothing. dunno why

its not paranoid protection, its no different than making sure your wallet isnt hanging out of your pants. if there is a hole in your pants then sure you are gonna lose that money. im not saying build a safe around your bitcoin wallet, im saying check yourself for holes first, worry about the bitcoin network after that. its open source, it will be hardened over time.

but the bitcoin client shows a place for tipping transaction verification. whats that for?

That's odd I don't see what they get out of it.

Bloating? What do you mean?
@_date: 2016-07-25 19:30:33
so i have to setup a miner to do that?
is there a way to setup a miner that just does tranactions and doesnt mine normally?
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:17:26
Why on Earth would they do that?
