I get this. But "current bitcoin price" is not based on your offer. Its based on exchanges. So in the long run that bitcoin becomes the one main currency everyone uses, your example is correct. But short run, your sell bid does not dictate anything. Exchanges do. Whenever someone posts price of a bitcoin on this sub, whats it based on? An exchange. And this is all just food for thought. Im heavily invested in bitcoin. But coinbase being down or out of supply,  making the price go down got me thinking about this.

I thought the exchange holds the coin. I know thats not how stocks work and such but I thought coinbase holds them based on using them before. There is no bid order.

The implications are not hate. I see how stating implications of China having you by the balls seems like hate but its not said in ill will. Its a realization delivered as a service.

So China being 70%+ (and thats lowballing) of the mining power and 90% (another lowball) of all of bitcoins volume being facts does not compute to you, huh? Blinded by hopes of being rich.

This is a bigger picture than you are currently thinking about.

Buy brother buy. Bitcoin is our god on this sub. I dont care if you are making $2 a day in greece. Invest it in bitcoin! Bitcoin is a safe haven (that drops 30% the next day)!!!!

Right. But price is not dictated on bids. Price is dictated based on volume currently right? If you cant buy because no supply, how can it go up?

Facts are now hating? Sounds like a defense mechanism to validate your investment.
