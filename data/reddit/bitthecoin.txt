Due to variance, there wasn't a block for about an hour and twenty minutes. However, there were two in the last five minutes and your transaction should be confirmed shortly if it has a reasonable fee attached. You can see the blocks and mempool (collection of unconfirmed transactions) here: 
Hope that helps!

I personally have no problem with Bitpay. Merchant adoption may not be working out so well, but their open source contributions including Copay, Insight, and Bitcore make them one of the coolest companies in the space for sure.
Gemini is just another exchange of many that already serve the same type of customer as far as I'm concerned. It would be more interesting if the ETF were approved.

Not sure why you're being downvoted because you're right. I guess it doesn't support the "Coinbase is a big bad bank" narrative.

Darknet markets have been a large driver of the bitcoin economy since the very beginning, perhaps the largest. They are a totally new way of distributing drugs and I would argue they have actually actually helped the price, not damaged it. The media will continue to cite any "controversial" aspects of bitcoin they can, and the best thing to do is develop more interesting, legal uses to talk about.

I am currently working on an iOS app that will have this function. It will also include other small Bitcoin utilities to sweep private keys and handle BitID authentication, for example.
~~If you would rather not wait, another developer has an app called [ELECTsUM]( that is already available and seems like what you're looking for.~~
EDIT: I just tried out ELECTsUM because I never have before and wanted to confirm the information below. I deleted it before I could test it and can no longer recommend it. Besides having a very confusing UI (if it does indeed support using the MPK), it is painfully slow on my relatively new device and does not support multiple wallets. Who knows what other annoyances are lurking in the code? You can request a refund through the App Store (as I will be doing) once you receive a receipt for your purchase.

I don't think this would qualify as technical analysis, which mostly has to do with trends and patterns of historical prices represented on a chart. The idea that Bitcoin production affects price seems to fall better into the category of *fundamental analysis*, and by the law of supply and demand makes perfect sense.

Mavericks has a feature that limits system resources when an app is not visible to the user. It's supposed to save energy and dedicate more resources to the frontmost app currently being used.

I recommend you read up on the security mechanisms employed by blockchain.info before jumping to conclusions. While there are some very real security issues here that need to be addressed, **blockchain.info is not stealing private keys**. They have no way to do so because they exist in encrypted format on their servers. The keys are decrypted client-side in the user's browser and are never sent to the server. This said, I recommend more secure wallets like Electrum or Trezor (or both together), or paper wallets for larger sums of money.

I had some issues recently sending to an external address as well. It took 10 minutes to actually show up as an unconfirmed transaction. Unacceptable knowing how fast bitcoin transactions are able to propagate.
Also, one of my most recent manual purchases says "You received bitcoin from Coinbase", instead of "You purchased bitcoin" like the others. Still says "Pending" though.
Definitely some weird stuff going on. Perhaps a lot of people are moving coins or buying them and they're having to pull from cold storage?
EDIT 1: On top of this, I experienced a bug on their site yesterday. The $5 for adding account details banner came up, but it showed I had completed all steps and then disappeared when I clicked on it. This is why Coinbase is only a place to buy for me. I don't store any coin there for more than a day or two.
EDIT 2: Some coins that I purchased just became available in my account (the day they were supposed). I'm reluctant to send them out though until the external transaction issue is resolved.
**EDIT 3: I sent from my Coinbase account to an external wallet just now (16:42 UTC) and it showed up on the blockchain within a minute! Seems things may be fixed?**

For example, the final string that generates the private key could be "in2 the3 deepest7 ocean5 the3 bottom6 of2 the3 sea3" but it isn't. It still contains the original string is what I believe OP meant.
@_date: 2014-01-26 15:18:27
I agree. Perhaps op is really doing an experiment in how long he can occupy people with trying to guess it haha. Even writing a program to churn out guesses would require a better set of bounds than "you can replace, swap, delete, insert characters." I think a human guess based on KallistiTMP's observations is the most likely to crack it.
@_date: 2014-01-27 01:36:45

Well I'm working on a program, but I really am at a loss as to what rules I should use to structure my search.

Perhaps I can try patterns that have been suggested here as well, but I doubt OP has revealed their strategy or anything too close to it with the examples.

Maybe more people will realize that if they don't control their keys they don't control their coins and keep less in Coinbase. For a lot of people though, I think the convenience is worth it compared to learning secure storage (which hopefully devices like Trezor can change). I'm much more comfortable keeping coins in a wallet where I control the keys because of situations like this.
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:58:24
I think the bounds of the rule are too broad as it is for someone who doesn't know the result. Can you say whether the result contains spaces? Is each word of the passphrase preserved in the result?

@_date: 2014-11-27 21:45:42
It doesn't necessarily depend on accessing their blockchain.info wallet.


Many users buy bitcoin with Coinbase which allows message signing, and then transfer it to their blockchain.info wallets. Others have a separate wallet on their phone which has been used to move coins back and forth, or have swept funds from a paper wallet. Obviously these cases don't apply to everyone and other options would be needed.
**EDIT: I wasn't thinking about that clearly. Please disregard what I said.**
@_date: 2014-11-27 21:59:01
Brawker's new multi-sig setup is 2 of 3, with the bitcoin buyer, spender, and Brawker each holding a key. This means that both the buyer and spender have control over their funds. Brawker only uses their key in a dispute and cannot move the funds without permission from either the buyer or spender.
My experience with PurseIO is that they hold the only key and the spender's funds must be deposited first, then the spender can withdraw them upon a successful transaction.
It's great to hear that PurseIO is beefing up their security, but they should go all the way like Brawker and not require a deposit into a wallet they control.

I haven't used Armory, but it seem like a solid, feature rich solution. I personally like Electrum ( It's very lightweight in that it doesn't store the whole blockchain and that it has a pretty basic set of features while not missing anything crucial. The cold storage wallet with watching only wallet setup is very secure and not too difficult to set up. I'll probably be switching over to a Trezor though, just because it's a lot easier than using a Live CD to boot an offline system or using a dedicated offline computer.

* You can replace, swap, delete, and insert characters according to a rule.
* There has to be a pattern.
* The passphrase is most definitely part of the final string.
* A standard QWERTY layout was used.
* Most to all of the original letters are used.
* The rule can be described by an English sentence of 5-10 words or less
* Knowing the album doesn't give anything away.
* The result has anywhere from 30 to 60 characters.
* The manipulation of the passphrase is "reasonable" for the human mind.
* There is one rule. Multiple rules are not combined.
* "in The DeePesT ocEan The BotTom Of tHe sEa" - capitalize every third letter
* "in the deepest oxean the bottom of the sea" - replace each "c" with "x"
* "inthe deepest oceanthe bottom ofthe sea" - combine two words, skip one
* "ni het eepestd ceano het ottomb fo het eas" - move the first letter of each word to the end of that word
* "in the dee0pest oce0an the botto0m of the sea0" - add ((*)) after the second vowel of all words in such instances where there is a second vowel within the word
* "in t d oce t b o th se - add @ after every third letter
* "in@ the deepest ocean the bottom@ of@ the sea" - add @ to the end of all words that have an even number of letters

The Bitcoin client takes a long time to get up to date. Torrenting the block chain is a faster way to get it than downloading from other nodes. Basically, you get the majority of it through a torrent and the rest by standard syncing built into the client. In the future, this will be unnecessary because of upcoming features liken headers-first sync.

I believe if you use a passphrase with Trezor in addition to your 24 words it is treated like a 25th word. The pin code is just to protect the device itself from unauthorized access. If someone got ahold of your 24 words and a new Trezor (and your passphrase if you have one), they could recreate all of your accounts, without needing your pin.

For the most part, CoinJoin transactions have a roughly equal number of inputs and outputs, and they pay miner fees just like other transactions. What resource are you talking about and in what way is it expensive?
The ability to have financial privacy is an important part of any currency, but if you don't care about that I'm not going to try to convince you. Bitcoin is what you want it to be.

It wouldn't be a problem for those immediately taking liquidity on JoinMarket to create a CoinJoin transaction, but the market makers are just running a script that publishes an order and automatically signs transactions that fill that order. A maker using a Trezor would have to watch for new transactions 24/7 and be ready to press the confirm button.

Just wanted to say I really appreciated reading many of your thoughtful responses in this thread. Most Americans respond to terrorism in entirely the wrong way, first with fear, then by giving up their rights to privacy with no clear benefit. Very few people even talk about why terrorism happens.

I think promoting this sort of thinking is one of the main ways Donald Trump attracted voters. He gave people who don't practice complex thought (unfortunately a very large percentage of the country) what they like best, simple answers to extremely complicated issues. All economic issues are clearly China's fault, or all crime is clearly just committed by Mexicans and Muslims. Those examples clearly aren't true (to people who think critically), but that essentially was/is his message. In reality, complex problems have complex, multifaceted solutions that aren't possible to simplify into one or two words. However, people who don't understand this wanted someone to blame for why their lives aren't what they want or why they're scared and Trump gave it to them. They gave him their vote. Therefore it's not at all surprising to me to find a Trump supporter spouting such simple and inaccurate drivel.
Anyway, I'm wayyy off topic here. I just started thinking about your comment and needed to get the rest of my thoughts out. One of the best thing about bitcoin is it doesn't give a fuck about your political views. It's just there for anyone who wants to participate.

Before you all downvote me for not participating, I think Bitcoin is really impressive technology and I'm invested in it. That said, I knew r/Bitcoin could be a circlejerk but this takes the cake for sure.
A bit is a micro-bitcoin. So micro-bits would be bit-bits. Great. Let's do some math.
1 BTC = 1,000,000 bits (micro-bitcoin)
1 bit = 1,000,000 bit-bits
1 BTC = 1,000,000,000,000 (that's 1 trillion) bit-bits
Assuming 18.25 bit-bits = $18.25 (a decent wage)
1 bit-bit = $1
1 BTC = $1,000,000,000,000
21 million BTC (market cap) = $21,000,000,000,000,000,000
There's such thing as speculation, and then there's pure delusion.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:16:05
Perhaps I wasn't clear enough in my comment. I understand the legal situation. However, if a child's money isn't easily accessible to the entity seizing money, they may say, "whatever, going to court and understanding this Bitcoin stuff isn't worth the time and money for only $200 more."
I'm sure one of the next arguments is that parents could be using their children to hide money or something to that effect. The parent could also just be using Bitcoin as well. In the situation I'm familiar with, my friend and his brothers had done nothing wrong and they were blindsided when their accounts (holding money *they* worked for) were drained. That's really fucked up and makes legal ownership for minors or systems that effectively provide it despite the legality seem pretty desirable.

It sounds to me like this isn't even an Apple Pay security issue and more of a card issuer security issue, where fraudsters bypass lax bank security when verifying their identity. It would be less convenient, but the banks should be requesting the same information as is necessary to obtain the card in the first place if they don't want to be exposed to fraud.
The real problem here is that **Apple Pay is an attempt to secure an inherently insecure system.** When a bank controls access to your money, anyone who can trick the bank has access to it too, whether your payment is given a unique identifier and your data is stored in a Secure Element or not. "The weakness identified... occurs at an earlier stage." That weakness is centralized banking.
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:11:52
I agree. I think a lot of people fail to understand or refuse to acknowledge that going from $0.10 to $1,000.10 per BTC and $1,000.10 to $2,000.10 are both $1,000 increases, but the first is a 10001x return on investment while the second is only 2x. Of course I think bitcoin still has potential as an investment, but massive returns like turning $100 into $1,000,000 are unlikely.
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:48:44
What's different about Bitcoin is that anybody can hold their private keys privately. **Bitcoin doesn't care if you're a minor, a criminal, a citizen, or even software.** This inclusiveness is one aspect I find really appealing.
The entity seizing the parent's money may be forced to take the parent to court instead of just making the child's money go *poof* without warning. In my opinion, this is a really positive outcome, as the entity seizing money is forced to be more transparent and is less likely to do anything illegal.
I think it will be really interesting to watch as the laws of Bitcoin are tested against the laws of our governments in the future.

Card numbers and private keys are completely different and allow for different functionality.
Card number | Private keys
• Visible to merchant each time you pay for something | • Only visible to the owner, not revealed by use. Hardware wallets make generating and storing them securely easier.
• Once compromised, your funds are at risk | • Using technology like multisig, one or more of your private keys can be compromised without your coins being stolen
• One other party (the bank) has access to your account. Really, they're the ones that allow you access. | • Only you have access to your account. You and only you can choose to give other people access.
• One tier of security. Once it's gone, so is your money. | • Multiple tiers of security and available amounts. Store a spending key on your phone loaded with a small amount for day to day use but keep the majority of your funds in cold or near cold storage with a different key (paper wallet, Trezor, etc). [Thanks Edit: Moved last row into a new table based on comment. I got carried away and started to compare traditional banking and bitcoin instead of just card numbers and private keys.
Traditional Banking | Bitcoin
• You let someone else take responsibility for securing your money. One benefit is insurance against fraud. | • You take responsibility for securing your own money. One benefit is that as long as you do a good job, nobody can take your money without your permission.

Someone or something connected to the Bitcoin network has a lot of transactions to send and they don't care too much about how long it will take to confirm them? Your guess is as good as mine. Assuming malice with no evidence however is a bad idea. Also, miners can choose which transactions they want to process and I would expect they do so mainly by fee. Anyone including a reasonable transaction fee has no reason to be concerned about the behavior you're describing.

Approximate number of people on Earth: 7,324,814,000
Number of hours per year: 365\*24=8,760
Number of transactions per year: 7,324,814,000\*8,760=64,165,370,640,000
Number of seconds per year:
Transactions per second (tps): 64,165,370,640,000/31,536,000=2,034,671 (rounded up)
Every human on Earth *couldn't* make one (Bitcoin) blockchain transaction every waking hour every day of the year (and expect to see it confirmed)... unless the network scales by a factor of nearly a million. Just throwing some numbers up though for people to compare with current tps. If Bitcoin is wildly successful, I expect that 99.99% of transactions will (have to) occur off chain.

I'm not sure I fully understand what you're saying. The table is actually to compare credit/debit card numbers to private keys. The intent was for row 3 to address the access privileges and row 4 to concede that a credit card insures you against fraud.

Thank you. The danger of LocalBitcoins is blown completely out of proportion here. Just follow a few simple rules and it's pretty easy to stay safe.
* Meet in a well lit, public place with other people around. Coffee shops are a good option.
* If you feel like something sketchy is going on, decline to trade and get out of there.
* Don't talk about how many bitcoin you have.
* Just bring your phone, not a laptop or anything else valuable except for cash if you're buying. You can buy and sell on LocalBitcoins with any SMS capable phone linked to your account.
* If you want another level of protection, only trade with users with 100% reputation and a good number of successful trades.
I've traded with many people on LBC (plenty of first trades) and never once had a problem.

What about something like this that takes advantage of Bitcoin features?
1. Create a multisig address for which multiple members of your family hold a private key, with what you feel is an appropriate m of n threshold.
2. Every month or after moving your bitcoin, create a transaction with nLockTime one month in the future that sends all your bitcoin inputs to the multisig address.
3. Send this transaction to your family (it cannot be mined for a month).
4. Before the lock time is reached, move some of your bitcoin to a new address to invalidate the lock time transaction and go back to step 2.
If you die, you won't be able to invalidate the lock time transaction before it is mineable. Your family can submit it and claim your bitcoin. Then, m of n family members will need to agree on how to spend your bitcoin.
Obviously, this method is a bit complex due to using special transactions and multisig, but with a few scripts and instructions it seems feasible.
There are two downsides I see to this method. You must trust everyone with a multisig key to secure the key and not prevent you from invalidating the lock time transaction for their gain. Additionally, those with access to the lock time transaction will be able to see your bitcoin balance, which isn't ideal from a financial privacy standpoint. Any ideas on solving these?
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:57:16
Does it show that your coins were tranfered somewhere and you now have 0 BTC, or does it just show 0 and no transaction history or anything like that? If it's the latter than this is likely an issue with your seed or browser.

Thanks for the example, I was trying to think of one but couldn't remember exactly where I'd seen it before. Coinbase is another example. They have a [tool to recover coins from your multisig vault]( in case they're offline.

I originally posted about [a funny section on the "Protect your idea" page]( but have since noticed other small issues with the site (so have others) and thought I'd compile them all in one place in case sees this. It seems like you have a great concept that just needs a bit of refinement and some proofreading.
**Issues listed by page:**
* "Safe - Certificates are stored in the cloud" Great, how is that safe though? They could be stored in a public Dropbox folder, but aren't they really stored on the blockchain?
* "Secure - State-of-the-art encryption (256)" You may want to expand a bit on how your encryption scheme works. Just saying "256" doesn't provide much assurance. Below, you combine safety and security in the same panel. Maybe consider doing the same above.
**Protect your idea**
* Above the banner linked to above there is a header that says ~~"Who Trust Our Awesome Services"~~ "Who Trust Our Services". It does sound a bit more professional without the "Awesome", but I was actually commenting on the fact that it should be "Trusts" plural, or you could say "Companies Who Trust Our Services". Still, I think this header is a bit disingenuous because none of those companies are actually using your service, they're just accepting Bitcoin.
* "Your proof will be valid forever, even if we shutdown our service. Laws of mathematics cannot die." asked in [this comment]( for details on how proofs can be recovered if your service shuts down. Also, are uploaded files being saved on your servers? This seems like it would be a bad idea.
* "What Are You Waiting" should probably be changed to "What Are You Waiting For?"
* "we are the leading company in mathematically enforceable proof of anterioty." This should start with a capital letter since it's a sentence. There seems to be a lot of switching between capitalizing every word, completely lowercase, and first word capitalized text on the site. In my opinion it would look better to unify things somewhat.
**My certificates**
* Why does someone need to create an account to certify a file or view other files they've certified? This is brought up [here]( by I second that the FAQ should be available without creating an account too.
* "Our team" This is one instance where I think it would make sense to capitalize both words.
* "Bitcoin addict, early adopter and investor" should be in the more detailed text with "Founder &amp; CEO" from below in its place. Your role in the company should be put first.
* Aaron Swartz isn't a member of your team as the about page would lead one to believe at first glance. mentioned this [here]( and did as well. You may want to move his quote into your bio or change the styling so that it isn't styled the same as your section. Perhaps something like "Aaron Swartz said, "What is the most important thing you could be working on in the world right now? ... And if you're not working on that, why aren't you?" This principle drives me to work on projects like Bitproof that I'm passionate about."
* "Sleeping 5h a day" My confidence in your security just skyrocketed. You claim to have two offices. Who else is working in them?
* You may want to remove the silly subtitles about your locations. I can appreciate the attitude you're going for but you wouldn't want to risk offending potential users.
* "San Mateo (Silicon Valley)", "Paris (France)" One of the places in parentheses is a general area of tech entrepreneurship while the other is a country. I'd recommend "Paris, France" or something like that, not that anybody would really be confused with the picture of the Eiffel Tower to the right. Just another minor inconsistency that you may want to consider.
Ok, I'm done with my heckling. Really it seems like you're off to a great start and I definitely didn't make anything this cool when I was 17. Please don't take any of my constructive criticism the wrong way. I just think a little bit of editing and tweaking of your site design would go a long way toward displaying a professional web presence. Hopefully these comments can help in that regard.

But it is with the power of multi-sig. Coinbase actually offers the option for you to hold the majority of the keys for your vault if you wish.

It's on their ["Protect your idea" page](

Bitreserve has a 0.45% fee for each conversion. I've used it and it's super slick. They even have an API so the process could be fully automated. The question now is whether Bitreserve will allow a dispensary business to use their service.

How much do you think they would need to cash out per month for these expenses? Couldn't they sell their bitcoin for cash OTC?

Thanks for the confirmation.

I'm not sure exactly, but here's the info on it.

It's Python. It's a great language for writing quick scripts for tasks like this. There are so many great modules as well (like pycoin) that have already done most of the work for you for various tasks. You just have to call the right functions. I'd definitely recommend looking into it.

The last four bytes of the WIF private key are the checksum. This is the part missing from the image (last two characters). Knowing this, it isn't even necessary to brute force as did.
    from pycoin.encoding import a2b_base58, b2a_hashed_base58
    
    key = "5KeTfM8HyXpvgdqNXmJjfv4szvNAajSrDVZhMC8uHyGTTEn2SXX"
    
    # convert base58 encoded key to binary
    binaryKey = a2b_base58(key)
    # remove last 4 bytes (base58 "XX") because it's an invalid checksum
    binaryKey = binaryKey[:-4]
    # convert back to hashed base58 string (also called Base58Check encoding)
    result = b2a_hashed_base58(binaryKey)
    print(result)
You could even do it all in one line.
    print(b2a_hashed_base58(a2b_base58("5KeTfM8HyXpvgdqNXmJjfv4szvNAajSrDVZhMC8uHyGTTEn2SXX")[:-4]))
