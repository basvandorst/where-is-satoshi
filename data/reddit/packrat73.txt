Probably Whisky alright  - he appears not to have enough class to know good whiskey... 
Johnnie Walker...  lol.

It doesn't really unless he wants It to. 
However: I'd imagine he would want it to:
He is posting on an international forum, he appears to be trying to help people. People who try to help others at their own expense often have a fairly well developed sense of fairness; ya know - part of being a non-sociopathic human... 
I really couldn't care less, if there were two horses in a race and I backed both at 20 to 1 they'd both lose, that's my standard of luck. I'm not going to get some of his bitcoin either way.

I'm sitting here almost in tears reading this. My BTC has almost all gone on this very thing to no avail. 
In my country, there's no "free round" of IVF and we have paid out for 2 full cycles ourselves. Our health insurance doesn't cover fertility treatment. 
My wife is despondent and I can't fix it. 
The little bit of BTC left now is what i got for the BCH of August before I withdrew the last 1.5 BTC for the second cycle. 
Unfortunately it won't be enough.  
These price jumps just serve to twist the knife knowing that if we had waited we would have more chances. 
Hope it works out for you OP.

I sincerely hope you are right in your prediction but I fear that these hopes will be dashed. 
Governments without control of money will be just beggars who must hold out the bowl and ask nicely for funds for each project based on its perceived merits. 
Banks without control of money have no reason to exist. 
There are two chances that the governments and banks who own almost everyone and everything will allow their power to be usurped like this: Slim and None. 
They still control about 99% of the world's wealth and crypto will be strangled to death if it threatens this. 
Again, I sincerely hope you are right and I wish that this comes to pass, but I don't believe it will. Yet. 
Down vote all you like but it would be more constructive to show me where I'm wrong!

Yes. There are two kinds of enemies - the one whom you meet 25 years later and shake hands, and the other type.
The type who kills your child. The type who tries to destroy this beautiful thing which is Bitcoin.
This type of enemy deserves no forgiveness no rest and absolutely no mercy until they are all gone....  
This is BCH and it's type.

To solve the problem of people beinh widely dispersed:
What about doing up an online board with 500 or 5000 squares and have everyone pick one square, then it gets locked so they can't change or multi pick. 
Preload the squares with different amounts of BTC and when all squares are taken then unmask which squares have btc in them. 
I understand that this is more a lottery than a treasure hunt, but it's at least fairer... 
Maybe someone can help with the code or expand the idea..

What?  You mean your "freedom" doesent extend to selling your own property how you choose? 
What kind of banana republic is that? 
What is a "title company"?

Most important piece of advice is to disclose no keys public or private anywhere. 
Take your time to learn and understand what keys or addresses you have and what they can do for you. 
You can do this. 
It took me till a couple of days ago to figure out how to split my coins from the Aug 1st fork. 
They weren't gone anywhere even though I couldn't see them. 
(This is another upside for you, - if you own BTC then you also own it's handicapped cousin which has a value albeit lower) 
If you get it back and it's significant money, consider helping out some needy charity with a little. Not beggars here.

I've bought and sold property. Thankfully I live in an actual free country (as opposed to one who shouts to the world about how free they are) where I don't have to ask permission from any "title company" 
I can actually buy or sell my own property and then register the title deed with the land registry agency (No charge as it's a public body paid for by taxes) 
BUT "Go Murica" keep believing you're "free"

Nope,   Bcash/Btrash and those who advocate it are cancer.  
This sub doesn't like scams. 
If it bothers you, feel free to not come here.  We won't cry like Roger - I promise.

There are PLENTY of fathers who could and would say no to that.  I know - I have one and I'm definitely not 13. 
I would hope to not only be the father that listens but to be the one who actively incentivises my child to learn about money like my parents failed to teach me.

FYI.  Greece uses the Euro. It's most of the reason they are in a mess. No Hyperinflation there. They actually need inflation but can't have it because of being in a hard currency. 
Agree with your post in general.

Oh look - an angry offended politico..  who thinks that whichever particular group/individual he has a hard on for is actually going to change something  - apart from their own bank balance. 
Idiots like you are the reason these parasites thrive.
