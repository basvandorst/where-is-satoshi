People keep saying this. But why? Is it particularly good at "storing value"? It's complete bogus. I'd rather store my value in a currency that is fast and cheap to actually use.

We already passed those points and bounced back. You are absolutely talking out of your ass.

Yeah, doesn't MySpace still reign supreme?

How much whinging can you fit into a title, OP?

If those little shits are going to be whining that the gift is not big enough you should just give them TRX as a punishment.

Thanks a lot for the tip! I am looking ideally for an exchange with a wider offer of alt crypto coins though! But for Bitcoin this sounds pretty great!

Does anyone know a subreddit about crypto that isn't populated by shitty memes?
@_date: 2018-09-10 11:50:10
Retarded memes are going to destroy crypto lmao

Is this dude the dalai lama or what?

Can I also just get some added bonus money instead of the wells?

It blew my mind that in 2017 the government would dictate what porn the subjects were supposed to be watching.

I **HODL** because it is a statistical surety that as soon as I sell, the price will skyrocket.

Man being an American in crypto must suck in so many different ways. Pretty content being a UK citizen, where a senior government politician recently said: "We should welcome cryptocurrencies in a way that doesn't constrain the potential of this technology"

Man I knew it was a bad idea to get into crypto

Really? I know that she has lost a lot of her grasp over the cabinet, so it could be that this particular individual just felt this way and it wasn't government policy.
I have to say I was surprised, because the UK generally is the most eager to introduce draconian bullshit when it comes to internet stuff.

Also the Paraguayan new year is coming up, always a bad time for bitcoin.

I am a kind of semi-leftist. Leftist in some ways, more libertarian in others. I find frivolous government subsidies stupid, but I do not feel that people should be foregoing medical treatment because they cannot afford it.
For me I would like to see a largely Libertarian society, with good, government funded infrastructure, strong trade unions, and free medical care. No foreign aid, no government hand-outs for anyone but the truly sick or disabled, no culture subsidies, and no attempts at controlling public behaviour through vice taxes.

Oh yeah, "journalists" are so bad!

So, you're saying you do grocery shopping in Bitcoin? Do you ever go to restaurants? Can't really envisage how this would work.

"We don't want publicity, we keep a low profile far from media."
Why?
