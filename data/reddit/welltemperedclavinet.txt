How on earth is this news not making more waves within the BTC community? 
I understand there is some sentiment that bad news about btc hurts everybody. Call me crazy, but I for one appreciate the TRUTH

My vote goes to Xapo. For me it's all about security and their vault uses some straight up sci-fi shit to protect my coins. 
I lost coins in the Mt Gox debacle and never again will I trust anything else except the xapo vault. I have it on good authority that it is the most intense cold storage solution out there and is fully insured by some of the biggest names in insurance.

Also, Xapo came out with the Vault first and then coinbase and circle followed suit shortly thereafter. Circle and Coinbase's vault seem like a total ripoff of Xapo, even down to the way that they describe it on their websites.

a PIN is for accessing your wallet and a password is for accessing your vault. 2 separate things
