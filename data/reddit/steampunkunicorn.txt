1. It's a joke.
2. Given the [high suicide risk of trans people]( I would say that yes - in fact it does affect physical survival.

And you appear to be a troll yourself. I'm assuming you looked up my comment history, in which case you'll know exactly how pathetic I think you are.
And no, I have no interest in "proving" I'm not mentally ill, just an interest in getting the right treatment for my conditions.

In simple terms, the default sex of a foetus is female. Basically, we all start out 'female' in the womb, and then sex hormones are introduced which finalizes the growth one way or the other.
If male hormones are delayed, it is possible that the brain starts to develop as that of a female, and then the male hormones are introduced which trigger the development of male physical features and sexual organs.
I don't know of anyone who has ever asserted that race and gender are *entirely* social constructs, but it's just common sense that *most* of the non-physical characteristics we associate with one gender or the other are social. 
Now, do explain to me your hypothesis of how one could be born with the brain of a different race? I am intrigued.

Well given that gender reassignment is the medically accepted procedure for treating people with gender dysphoria, I think the word you are looking for is "treat" rather than "indulge".

Funny, most medical professionals would disagree with you on that one. I don't suppose you have any relevant medical education and experience to back up your statement?

"Transgender is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity differs from what is typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth."

Actually, there are widely accepted medical reasons for it. Just because *you* don't understand it, doesn't mean it's magic.
