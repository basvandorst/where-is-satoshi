No, that was basically all GOX imo...The insane bull market run was caused in very large part by their manipulation of price and volume on the exchange...We here no real way to tell where Bitcoin would have been, or would be now with out the positive publicity from the inflated price, market effect of the inflated price, spawn of countless altcoins at the price peak and subsequent trading, and the after effects of the hack/manipulation coming to light both in market value and public perception...

I wish they had raided YESTERDAY...Just made half of some large buys I had planned.  Thankfully I was still waiting for another deposit to buy the second half, so at least I can get SOME cheap coins to offset things.

Heh, not my first time, but I JUST bought back in over the last two days.  For 5 figures...Slightly annoyed, but this was money to invest long-term so I am not that upset.  Would have been nice to have my deposits take another day or two so I could have gotten a 10% discount.

"Satoshi's Vision" and all that...
Satoshi was brilliant, designed the basis of an amazing system, and did have clear hopes for where it would lead...However, it is ludicrous to believe that he was infallible or had any way to know how his theoretical expectations and predictions would play out in reality.

I'm fairly certain they know what is going on...The statement was published the same time the exchange went offline, and since it was a prepared statement not a reaction, they knew when the site was going down.
I think it is likely that the timeline for everything (halt of transaction, termination of the site, and release of this statement) was discussed at the same time Mark withdrew from the foundation...It seems like the joint statement was meant to be a response to a statement from Gox that was probably intended to be released around the same time, but for whatever reason was not.

Gox's death has been factored into the market for a while now, it was only a matter of time...Uncertainty drags down the market much more than bad news, and now that everyone knows the worst is true the market can recover again...
If you remove Gox from the equation, there has been nothing but very positive news for the past several weeks.

Hmm...I wonder if there is any way to make a sudoku-themed alt coin...Something where every 9 blocks have rewards that would form a random valid sudoku puzzle...

Update that claims issues are not fixed with no ETA on testing or further update...CEO leaves Bitcoin Foundation...Twitter account wiped clean...Trading halts on exchange...Exchange website goes down...CEOs of other major exchanges publish a statement that initially states Gox is insolvent (reworded in minutes)...All major bitcoin-reporting sources proclaim Gox is dead...
Hours later with no word...No statement...No attempt to reassure the world that the company even EXISTS anymore...
Who cares if the document is fake...

Ok...The heads of the other major exchanges published a statement the exact same time Gox went offline...This statement was prepared in advance and contained statements that Gox was insolvent, which were removed soon after publication...
Do you really think they 'accidentally' put out a PREPARED statement, at the precise moment mtgox.com went down which contained inaccurate information?
What most likely happened is that the timeline for all of this (halting trades, website going offline, joint statement) was discussed at the same time Mark withdrew from the foundation.  Given the content of the initial version of the joint statement, it is clear it was intended to be a response to an expected statement by Gox which apparently never came.  Since the other exchanges do not have the right to declare Gox bankrupt without them announcing it first, this wording was revised...
I'm sorry, the time for wishful thinking is over...

If I had to venture a guess on the deposits, it would be because they simply had not shut the system that accepts them down yet...
Typical Gox behavior or not, they OBVIOUSLY know what is being said about them as it is all over the internet...It has been hours now...First an update saying things are not fixed with no timeline for resolution or further statement, CEO resigns from the Foundation, Twitter wiped, trading halted, website down...ZERO communication...Even they would not be so obtuse as to not issue some kind of reassurance at this point when every news outlet on the internet that covers bitcoin has pronounced them dead...
Either way, keep your own opinion if you wish...

With any luck this will get a large percentage of the population interested in crypto in general and act like a "gateway coin" to eventually lead them to bitcoin and other more established alts.

BEST case scenario is you get cheap coins and then wait weeks to be able to withdraw them, given the mass amount of outbound transfers that I am sure are planned and the fact that they will have a daily withdrawal limit...Good luck securing your place in the queue...

@_date: 2014-02-25 04:35:07
This will lead to transparent exchanges, which are already in the works...Once one transparent exchange opens, volume will shift to them providing incentive for other exchanges to adopt the same policy...

@_date: 2014-02-24 08:01:03
They almost have to be solvent at this point...All this time with no withdrawals, obvious insider trading (major market moves well before new statements are released)...Unless they managed to have their wallets almost completely emptied before they realized it or somehow lost access to most of their cold storage, they would have to be beyond incompetent to not have covered the loss by now...
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:38:43
On the flip side, once the dust from this finally settles maybe good news will actually have an effect on the market again...With Gox gone, I see few possible sources of bad news, considering all indications are any regulatory news coming out of the US seems like it is leaning in a positive direction.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:27:44

There is also no concrete ruling as to what existing laws and regulations actually apply to bitcoin, let alone what applies to something like a bitcoin ATM...
This is them covering their ass as much as possible in case there is suddenly a crackdown involving KYC or AML laws so that they can prove they did everything in their power to comply with said laws...
It may be more ID than is necessary, and the instant they discover that is the case, it will no longer be required...Much better to be safe than sorry when you are on the leading edge of the legal grey area...Unless of course you WANT to go to prison.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:07:11
I agree completely, and all it takes is one major exchange to adopt a policy of transparency before it would quickly become necessary for the others to adopt as well or risk loosing the competitive edge.

The house's take, is the house's take...Over the long term you will always fall victim to even the smallest percentage of house advantage.  Even using the [Martingale]( you will lose in the end...Using this system, you can decrease you chance of loss to .0001% however running the algorithm in that manner requires such a large amount of funds, and proportionally small betting amounts to support it, that each 'winning roll' nets a negligible return.  In the end, the amount of rolls you need to make to end up with a substantial gain, magnifies that .0001% to basically 50% anyway.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:32:21
Not really no...With the amount of money the company was raking in, there was no excuse for not hiring competent developers.  They had the means, and more importantly the obligation, to better secure their systems and methods of operation given the amount of money that was in play.
The smart option when you have a company that size, dealing with money in amounts that large, is to employ people capable of handling things at that level.  Mark should have found an actual CEO, hired a skilled team of developers to completely revamp the site and track down security vulnerabilities, and stepped back when things passed his level of skill to maintain.
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:13:43
I have mined on much smaller pools and we have gotten 2-3 at a time like this on occasion...It happens...I think there is simply a slight advantage to whoever finds a block, in that they can immediately move on to hashing the next while the other pools waste a little extra time before realizing the current block was found...
@_date: 2014-02-23 23:03:45
At the moment, even with the high initial % of new coins coming in, DOGE is currently at a relatively stable price vs BTC, so you could make the same argument about demand meeting supply, especially considering that the supply is increasing at a much faster rate now than it will by the end of the year.  (You also can't make the argument that demand always increases faster than supply with BTC, because by definition that would mean that the value is constantly increasing, which at the moment is not the case.)
As far as BTC inflation, new coins will be generated until 2140 (So yes, you will be dead), granted the percentage becomes much smaller as time goes on.  Also, if by that time doge is still around, the annual inflation rate for it will have dropped to a negligible 0.007%.
Also, when DOGE hits it final of 5 Billion per year (at the end of this year) it will maintain a lower inflation rate than BTC until 2017, and a lower rate than LTC until 2020...5 Billion coins is only 5% of the total, and this is a fixed value, meaning the % that 5 billion equates to will also drop over time.
You can joke about DOGE if you want, it is not meant to be taken seriously, but at least get your facts straight if you are going to try to pull out technical terms.  Actually, if you listen to opinions from anyone who actually deals with economics, they tend to agree that a slow, predictable amount of inflation is VERY healthy for any currency, and may very well give DOGE an edge when compared to other cryptos...

My advice would be NOT to day trade, especially if you have no experience...Coinbase is not the place to do it though, you will have days of delay on both the buying and selling side, so day trading is not possible...

Because THAT is the kind of attention we need at a time where the US is looking into regulatory actions involving Bitcoin...
I get the whole "fuck the government" sentiment from some people here, and that is all well and good in theory...Keep in mind though that with the stroke of a pen the US government can quickly kill Bitcoin for all practical purposes...
Yes yes, the government can not stop bitcoin, blah blah blah, but you have to be extremely naive to think that government can't stop it from ever going main stream and at a time where increasing the adoption rate is so important the last thing we need is more association with illegal transactions.

There is a big difference though between SHA-256 ASICs and Scrypt ASICs...The RAM requirements for Scrpyt will be a limiting factor in terms of scaling, so while an ASIC may be able to out perform GPUs, it will be no where near on the order that it is with SHA-256 as far as hashes per dollar due to the cost of RAM.
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:51:43
Not sure if this was sarcasm because there may, in fact, not BE an announcement, but if it was not sarcasm I will answer you.
The OP's joke is because Mt. Gox said a few days ago that Monday (they are on Tokyo time, so it is already Monday evening) they would make a further announcement about the 'fix' they are implementing and hopefully some news on when they would re-open BTC withdrawals...So everyone is frantically refreshing to try to catch that announcement if/when it is posted.

@_date: 2014-06-13 13:37:53
Well, the panic selling started when people noticed the movement of the coins...It was a couple hours before the REASON for this movement was made common knowledge.  I think the fear was hackers dumping the coins onto the market, or some flaw in the protocol that allowed access to these well known high-value addresses.  Once official word of the auction was spread the price recovered quickly.

@_date: 2014-10-05 19:24:44
There is a problem with that mentality though...For 10-100 people that "have lost enough money to think of Bitcoin as an investment" there are 10-20 people who have made a killing in the market selling into those drops...The more times this imbalance happens, the easier it will be for the next round of newcomers to get fleeced...This cycle is largely responsible for the decline in value, and greatly lowers the public trust in its stability...
While I agree that people should not come in hoping to get rich over night, you should not be so apathetic, and in this case joyful, that people are losing large amounts of money.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:43:39

Not being a miner myself, I am much more concerned with the stability of the network and the integrity of the blockchain than I am with where the new coins are going...My comment was on the likelihood that they would be willing to threaten their long-term steady gains by manipulating the network, though obviously the network would be healthier with more decentralization...
Also, people like to point out the block streaks...50% hashrate theoretically translates into mining 50% of the blocks, or a 50-50 chance of each block being mined by them...The odds of them mining 12 in a row might be very slim, but given the number of block that are mined in a day, their odds by my calculation come up to about a 7% chance a day, meaning it will on average happen twice a month...Mining 11 in a row will statistically happen twice as often, and so on...

It will be interesting...There may be a very large, very quick spike in the Gox price once they enable withdrawals as everyone tries to convert to BTC and get out...At the same time, many of those people may opt to hold what they buy and sell into that spike as well...
Either way, fiat withdrawals are not likely to come back anytime soon, so anyone who wants to completely get out of there will potentially have to pay a hefty amount over market for coin to transfer...

I hate this chart...It is used as an "omen of the apocalypse" even when the overall tend-line is positive.  The bubble crash pattern only really matters in the short term.  The important stage happens after this, either slow steady growth (possibly with other bubbles) or a continuing decline into obscurity...What happens to Bitcoin in the long term is still years away from becoming clear.

At the exact same time the website went down, the heads of several major exchanges released a joint PREPARED statement.  This is an obvious sign that they knew what was about to happen, and chances are the timeline for all of this (trading halt, website going offline, joint statement) was discussed at the same time Mark withdrew from the foundation.
Given that this prepared statement contained evident knowledge of Gox's insolvency, which was quickly removed, it seems likely that this statement was supposed to be in response to a Gox announcement which for some reason was never made, hence the edit.
Couple that with reports from many places that they are filling bankruptcy, fairly reputable confirmations that they are short 3/4 of a million coins, and this supposed insolvency plan leak...
I'd say the time for wishful thinking is long past.

I think more likely the large purchases in DOGE were by people already holding BTC rather than people bringing in new money (that is where all the BTC I converted into DOGE came from).  Profit is made, which over the last week or so would have been as much as %800 or more.  Then converting back into BTC and then cashing out for fiat, which seems a likely reaction for anyone who bought BTC in the last couple months looking for a quick profit considering how horizontal the BTC charts have been...
Even if the BTC being cashed out originated from recently bought BTC, the volume would be much higher for those that caught the %800 increase, though again I think most of that BTC was already on the market.

My guess is that when Mark withdrew from the foundation, this news was made known to the other members...More than likely, the timeline for releasing this statement and shutting down trading and the website was discussed...
It is also likely that they were expecting Gox to make a public statement around the same time, which for some reason they did not do, which would have addressed the issue.
Just my guess...

a $50-100 drop on the other markets is almost a 10-20% profit if you sell at the top and buy at the bottom...Do that a few times with tens of thousands of dollars over the course of a few days and you can make a very large amount of money.

I completely agree about one thing...A crash would be preferable to the stagnation we are seeing at the moment, but the main cause right now IS the uncertainty caused by Gox.
Like it or not though, events like this (ie mistrust of one of the oldest Bitcoin institutions by members of the Bitcoin community) is fuel for the fire in terms of negative media coverage.  It may not have any effect on the people who actually know what bitcoin is all about, but at some point public perception, which is driven almost entirely by the media, will have to change if long term mass adoption is ever going to happen.

This one is just a hardware wallet.  Though I have plans for much farther down the line that involve a version of this that can be plugged into a phone/computer to transmit payments as well, similar to the Trezor.

If you are still waiting, then you probably ordered late...It was just last week that I received what I order in June, and while I am disappointed, I can not be angry with them.  It was clear as day from their website that delivery would be "3 months, maybe longer" and there was "no guarantee of a return on investment".

Yes, but after 4 months the earning power of an ASIC is only about 10% of what it started at...This is why that variance in the first time period is so important...If pool luck is low for the first month, it does not matter how high it is for the next 3, your peak earning opportunity is lost, even if the pool's success balances out...Remember your slice of the pie gets smaller and smaller if you don't keep adding hash power, thereby starting the RI chase all over again.

The most logical assumption is that Gox's situation was made known to the Foundation at the time of Mark's withdrawal.  At that point, a timeline was agreed upon for Gox to halt trading, close the website, release the joint statement, and likely a statement from Gox as well.
Given the way that the joint statement was worded, the fact that it occurred at the same time the site went down, and the quick revisions to the text which had obviously been carefully worded and agreed upon, it seems it was supposed to be a response to a Gox statement which was never published.
Given that no statement came from Gox, the other exchanges who were made aware of their situation, they were legally obligated to remove the word "insolvency" from their statement...
There is no conspiracy in the way this post implies...They were legally obliged to not publish info on another company.

Considering the initial order volume, followed by the explosive increase in demand shortly thereafter, the likely answer is that they began production at a smaller factory with cheap rates.  Once demand increases it becomes an issue of trying to get that factory to increase production (which they may have been unable or unwilling to do because of existing contracts) or spend the money moving production to another company, which would involve the cost of them refitting lines all over again prior to production...
I have followed stories like this many times in the last 10 years from people I know in the industry and investments made on Kickstarter, and things are never smooth when you are a small company dealing with chinese production/distro...
Granted, they should have been more open about the issues and delays and they would have avoided quite a bit of this negativity, but that also would have lead to many more people cancelling orders and they likely could not have afforded to provide all the refunds after the production costs were paid...
Maybe I am just too empathetic...Or maybe it is because I have thought several times about trying to have projects of mine shift to mass production so I have done my research on the "worst case scenario"...Either way, I know if I had started a company like this, with NO REALISTIC IDEA that demand would suddenly become so high, I would be in the same position...After all, bitcoin was still relatively "worthless" when this all started and I doubt that even in their wildest dreams they did not expect 1/10th the number of orders they received.

There have been massive walls in place for the last couple weeks...Just like there were for the two weeks it stayed around 800...
It does not change the fact that the other companies involved in the statement can not legally comment on another companies pending bankruptcy or insolvency unless the company in question has made it public, hence the wording of the release being changed when a statement was not published by Gox.

I guess I am leaning towards the theory posted by here in this thread that Gox is deliberately pushing the info they have been due to insolvency...
If it IS in fact true that they are lying to everyone and trying to cover up the fact that they no longer have the capital to cover user accounts, I would not put anything else past them either...This includes the possibility that they may have been working behind the scenes in someway holding funds for SR2.
It just seems to me that the sudden theft of SR2 coinage, which is not possible due only to transaction malleability as it does not allow forcing transactions, it very well timed...Part of my reasoning in making this connection, is that if the people running SR2 were going to choose a time to 'cash out' users funds, this recent low is an odd time to do so without some other factor in play, such as a 'failing' exchange...
I know if I WERE involved in a plot like this, stopping transactions and reworking my tracking systems would be a great time to hide transactions and 'lose' customer's money under the pretense of being hacked...

Of course, it is NOT because Apple wants to protect customers for the sake of protecting customers, but rather because they don't want these flaws exposed...
Bitcoin wallets would give hackers more incentive to break into iOS, showing that it is not as "hacker-proof" as all the Apple fans have allowed themselves to believe...
Second, and most importantly, theft of Bitcoin from iOS wallets related to iOS security issues would open Apple up to major lawsuits, whether legitimate or not, and they to not want to accept that liability or the PR nightmare it would lead to...

Looking at the current  snapshot which shows BTC with a volume of 16442 and DOGE with a volume of 5599 and taking your comment into account...That would mean that the volume of DOGE is even higher in relation to BTC, given that some portion of BTC's total volume was merely a conduit for the trade of DOGE into fiat...
Again, my whole question was **could this be a factor in the decline in value for BTC**.
I am not trying to draw direct correlations between numbers here, just ask others for their interpretation.

The people holding BTC on Gox will have a tough choice...Transfer out ASAP, or wait for all the people buying coin to transfer out to drive up the price and sell into the spike for fiat they may never see with the hope of buying back during the lull...
I would guess that after this the price on Gox will temporarily jump up WELL above market because many people are going to be willing to pay a hefty premium to get out in any way possible.

A prepared statement signed by multiple CEOs from other exchanges was published the exact same time mtgox.com went down.  This statement initially used the word "insolvent".
The only logical answer is that this news was made known to the Bitcoin Foundation at the same time Mark withdrew.  A timeline was then set for the announcement from the other exchanges, trading being halted, the site going down, and likely an official statement from Gox (which never came).
Obviously, all the exchanges knew the site was going down when it did or there would not have been a statement just waiting to be posted.

Basically, the number of new coins mined each day will be cut in half, 25 per block mined becomes 12.5 per block, cutting the new supply of coins.  While the value will likely not skyrocket the instant this happens, the price will likely increase greatly in the days/weeks/months right before hand to account for the deceasing supply.

We have no way to know at what point in time they actually became insolvent, nor do we have any reason to believe that anyone in this list was actually AWARE of the situation...

Do you have any idea how much investment capital is required to have custom made chips and hardware produced?  That is why they explicitly stated on the website that preorder purchases were paying for production...There is no way they could have supported that level of investment prior to taking payments, a fact which they were open and honest about...
Of course, they then did the same thing with the new product lines to invest in upgraded chips and more powerful systems...Given the profit they made from selling $100-300 devices, they still could not afford to start production of $10k machines without additional start up capital...
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:58:38
I don't think this was a matter of Gox "letting them see the books", but instead a heads up from the Bitcoin Foundation in regards to what the actual situation is.
They would not have a PREPARED statement, obviously agreed on by all involved, without specific information.  It is also unlikely they would have taken the time to prepare a statement like this, far enough in advance of publication to have all contributed and agreed to the contents and wording, if there were going to be inaccuracies.
Whether or not they knew the site was going down, they obviously expected a statement from Gox at the same time they published theirs, considering it reads like a reaction rather than something published "out of the blue".  They could be in legal trouble if they make claims about Gox's financial status if Gox has not announced it first, which they clearly seem to have expected.

Eh...He is right...Bitcoin will soon be worth zero...If we are going by cosmic timescales, in which the Dollar, the Yuan, Gold, Plutonium, etc will also all soon be worth zero...I plan to be dead long before then though.

This exactly...
They had the time, the money, and more importantly the obligation to get their shit in order and failed to do so.  With the cash flow they had they should have hired several competent developers, revamped the site, boosted security, etc long before this became an issue (not to mention hired a CEO with an actual business background).  There is no excuse for such vulnerability from a company with that level of resources.
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:32:46
My hope is that there are several big investors (individuals, EFTs, new exchange startup, etc..) that have been holding off, hoping to score cheap coins from this auction.  Once the opportunity for a large amount of off-market coins is exhausted, these players will have to resort to buying from other sources and play 'catch up'...I can dream right?

I have been saying it a lot over the last 24 hours, but for the most part Gox's death has been factored into the market for a while now...The uncertainty of their fate is the only factor that drug value down from the 800 we were sitting at when the bad news from them started...
@_date: 2014-06-13 23:06:05
Sorry, but he is right...The infinite time frame is the key factor...When you only have a month to reap 80% of your profit from expensive hardware before crippling deminishing returns kick in, you do what you can to ensure minimal variance...Sure, pool luck over the course of several months averages out, but back when I was mining weekly, and even monthly, pool luck varied by enough to potentially make a huge difference...if you have more than a few hundred dollars invested in hardware (I am guessing OP has thousands) the need for consistency becomes much more profound.
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:13:34
It does...Unfortunately, in the short term, this is the single biggest factor in the market right now...Hopefully a few months from now this will just be a small blip on the radar, but for the next few hours/days this is all that matters.
EDIT:  Thanks for giving me some more hateful threads to read in the mean time.  I actually did NOT know this existed.

I can't argue with you on the technical side, but I don't look at this at all as a typical investment.  I look at trading, accumulating, publicizing, spending, etc. as more than an investment strategy and at the same time, not an investment strategy at all.
It is more me supporting a technology I believe in which I classify more as money spent on a hobby and of course an element that makes it similar to gambling.
Either way, nothing gets put into BTC that I can not afford to lose or that would not otherwise be spent as some other aspect of my entertainment budget...Not the best way to handle things on a future-oriented perspective to be sure, but I have no illusions of becoming independently wealthy from Bitcoin.  That ship sailed many months ago. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 01:32:57
Yeah, already the number of downvotes without objective discussion makes that obvious.
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:15:10
The prevailing opinion of the community right now is that Gox, being one of the oldest and most media visible exchanges, is simply no longer capable of securing funds, managing volume, or remaining trust worthy.  Given that, in the long run it might be better to see them go under rather than be the source of periods of extreme uncertainty and negative media focus.  If any of the worries of insolvency, manipulation, or double-dealings ever turn out to be verifiably true, then it will magnify, but Gox arguably has already done massive amounts of damage in the 10 last days in terms pf public perception, let alone prices.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:46:24

@_date: 2014-02-25 05:54:52
As I have said elsewhere, I completely agree...Both with the sympathy and the response.
They had the time, money, and more importantly the obligation to get their shit in order long before this became an issue.  Given the cash flow, they should have hired several more competent developers, revamped the entire site, increased web security, increased coin storage security, and dare it say it...Hired a CEO who was actually capable of running a large company with international interests...
Failure to do so is simply not acceptable for a company with their level of resources...At some point the realization that you have built something successful enough to grow beyond your own skill to manage must be made, and appropriate, responsible actions taken...

Yeah, I sold on the news all those coins were moving a few days ago, before word of WHY they were moving came out, because I was guessing there would be a 'panic'  This hashrate scare is making that an even better decision (though harder to guess the bottom).

The silence on everything else that has happened is cause enough for concern...Update that did not give an new info or a projection for a new update...Mark's resignation from the Foundation...Twitter feed wiped...Site goes down...Joint statement from the other exchanges who likely have some inside knowledge on the situation...
And through all of it, total silence from Gox which would have to be aware of the news being spread...Even without the rumors of 700K coins missing, there should have been some kind of reassurance or official statement from them by now...
@_date: 2014-01-01 22:46:39
95% of orders have been filled, if not more...Why are people so anxious to play the victim and claim they have been scammed?

I am actually starting to get more and more convinced that they ARE solvent...Now anyway...At least if anyone working there had "at least 10% function left in their prefrontal cortex" they should have had plenty of time by now to play their internal market, ship out cheap coins bought from customers, and bring the fiat back in...

Scam is the wrong word...It implies they intended to screw people from the start...The general opinion right now is that they simply don't have the coin on hand anymore to cover all the balances their users have, due to programming shortcuts that allowed THEM to be scammed by people exploiting a loophole in the bitcoin protocol.

He most definitely has...It is so very obvious who has and has not done their homework when it comes to interviews and opinions on the matter.  There is no way you can know the true basis of the protocol and not see its potential as a steamroller of innovation.  Whether Bitcoin as a currency will have a lasting impact is open for debate and speculation, but the system itself will be implemented in ways we can not even imagine over the coming years.
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:03:38
With all 4 exchanges on bitcoinwisdom showing only a $3-4 variance for once right around 640-645, I think it is a pretty good indication of where the auction ended, given that those who placed losing bids were probably only bidding up to the values they lost as since the know the winning price was more.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:31:15
I am in this for long term value as well, and I agree that overall the news is very good so far this year...However the malleability bug really only hurt Gox as far as protocol implementation is concerned and the rest of the network due only to DDoS slowing down transactions...Personally, all my worries about malleability were swept away within hours when the news of the REAL effects of it were discussed.
The problem with uncertainty quickly became due to Gox itself, its reaction, and the statement they initially published rather than the issue of malleability...For some reason the media still looks to them as the 'center' of the Bitcoin universe, and until they are operating a full capacity again the entire system is going to be viewed as "down due to hacks" even though within a very short time all the other exchanges were back to normal.
EDIT:  Actually, this whole issue COULD have been a major boost for bitcoin, considering how quickly and effectively the other exchanges were able to adapt, it could have been a prime example of how resilient bitcoin truly is...Unfortunately, the only thing holding back our advance right now...Is Gox...

When someone has thousands of dollars invested in hardware and a short window to make profit/ROI, it is that profit/ROI that matters...What incentive is there for miners to worry about long term price when their equipment becomes obsolete so quickly?
I am not a miner myself, but I completely understand the 'greed' and can not fault them for it.  Nobody would spend the amount of cash necessary to make it worth mining without expecting to profit from it...I don't consider it greed to maximize the returns from a $10,000 investment while you can...The price could be $0 or $1000 in a 4 months, but that doesn't matter when increased difficulty means that in 4 months you don't cover your power costs even at $1000.
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:25:19
Well...They are a little out of touch if they are gearing it towards BTC mining...No wonder why they have not made any public effort towards accepting payment in BTC...

At what cost to THEM I think is the question...If they open the door to Bitcoin, they will either have to provide a valuable, seemless, and low overhead integration option or they will actually lose business from the venture.  The more people learn about the benefits, low fees, and non-existent need for 3rd parties, the more they will make themselves irrelevant.  I would think they recognize this and will see the need to be 'honest' and innovative if they are serious about incorporating Bitcoin into things.
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:19:42
There is no reason the admins would actually need to log into accounts to audit transactions...If that IS the case, Gox's system is tied in even more knots that we were all afraid of...
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:11:33
The main reason is that most of the 'news articles' are just poorly researched cut and paste jobs...It is fairly obvious from reading most of them that the authors know nothing of the currency itself.
As for Gox, Considering that for a very long time their list price has varied 10% or more from the other exchanges, whereas the other exchanges usually were within 2% of each other, using Gox as a metric to gauge "market value" is an obvious indicator of ignorance.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:20:11
Yes and no...
SR2's statement seems like BS considering they claim malleability issues allowed hackers to force actual transactions rather than trick them into resending payments themselves, which is why many people are of the opinion they are simply stealing their users funds...
Likewise, people seem to be largely of the opinion that Gox is insolvent and deliberately lying at this point to cover that up while they weigh their options...If that IS true, and they are deliberately covering up a major problem of that nature, I would not put anything past them...
Again, this is all grasping at straws rather than accusations...The stories simply don't mesh with reality.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:37:12
My point is, if they took the time to generate a statement bearing multiple CEO's signatures, you can safely assume that it was worded as they intended before release and it is odd that they would choose to reword it AFTER publication rather than before they reach a consensus on its contents.
Granted it is only my opinion, but it seems to me that the only reason they would change the wording after the fact is worries about defamation suits that could result from declaring them insolvent/bankrupt before it was officially announced...Which again, given that the language was even IN the original statement, implies that they expected an announcement from Gox at the same time the site went down.
Edit:  If they were not certain of the information, it definitely would not have been the TITLE OF THE STATEMENT...
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:35:48
If that were true...Who would really trust or do business with a company that deliberately terrorized the market in such a way without any statements of reassurance?  This has done some major damage PR wise, serious damage over the last month value wise, and potentially catastrophic damage to the lives of individuals with substantial amounts of money on the exchange...
@_date: 2014-02-03 07:21:38
Really?  I thought it sounded like a great idea!  Give everyone in the world an equal amount of money, then see how much they can earn in 6 months before it resets and everyone starts over again with an equal amount!  It is like a financial ladder ranking system, what could possibly go wrong!

Actually, the price on Doge vs BTC has been rising over the last 2 days...It is a joke as a currency on the whole, sure...But it has value at the moment as a novelty and is a low barrier to entry currency that people are happy to mine with &lt; 100KH/s for fun.  I am not trying to make a killing with it, but it is easy to get, has a much more upbeat community, and has still been making me decent amounts of BTC since I can mine it quickly.

Scam implies premeditation, as in the site was designed from the beginning to mislead you into giving them money for things they could not deliver...
They may be dishonest, shady, reacting badly to being put in a tough position, having legit problems, etc but there is a difference...

"I can't get an answer from (insert new and heavily trafficked site)'s customer support! It's been 8 hours!  NEVER USE THIS SCAM SITE!!"

A fairly small percentage of the US population has fingerprints or other biometric data on file anywhere, though I am not sure what the regulations are when it comes to passports.

Personally, all my travel has been done on a Military ID in lieu of a passport.)

Exactly...A prepared statement, signed by multiple CEOs published in multiple places at the exact same time the site went down...
Coordinating and agreeing on the wording between the parties involved probably began the same day Mark withdrew from the foundation, and was likely intended to follow a statement from Gox which was never released...
Edit, you can't even attribute this to the other exchanges blogs being hacked, considering they went back and edited the text to remove the word "insolvent" rather than the whole post...

The price dipped $100 and recovered over the last few hours when this news first broke...Let's be real though...After the slide from 800 down to 500 all based on bad news out of Gox, their seemingly inevitable demise was mostly factored into the market already...
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:37:27
Of COURSE its circular reasoning...The entire market has been running in cycles since its inception...Don't get me wrong, I completely believe in Bitcoin as a technology, see it's merits in every area of finance, and want nothing more than to see it succeed, but due to the nature of an unregulated market with such a disparity in 'wealth', I fear these cycles will simply continue...
What you are seeing with these price drops is actually exactly what you are asking for...There are fewer speculators coming in an adding new money to  the system...However, those with the huge bankrolls are still going to drive the market, and the more money they take out of it the lower the price will go, because they don't give a shit about the price either when they gobble up coin each time the value drops to prepare for the next wave...
Your average person, which are the ones we need on board for mass adoption/long term viability, are NOT going to trust their hard earned money to a system like that WITHOUT the intent to get rich quick...

This version will not, and is only designed for cold storage/secure back up...One additional thing I plan to add is the ability to generate private keys on board as well.
I have other plans for something more 'Trezor' like in the future that will allow you to authenticate transactions either over USB or WIFI, and also some ideas for cheap and quick POS devices.  First, I want to get all the code for this steamlined.  Much of the code for any future devices will be very similar so this is a natural first step before I start adding in serial/network communication.

Two things are certain:
* If they truly had been focusing their efforts on fixing the issue, it would be fixed by now...They 'supposedly' have the fix complete and it is all down to testing, they have had days...
* Solvency, technical incompetence, and whatever else aside...It is painfully obvious at this point that they do not have customer's well-being high on the list of priorities.  If they did, they would be more forthcoming with information to try to decrease the panic they are causing.
Given the rumors, damage to exchange values, negative media coverage, etc their single-minded attention should be on enabling withdrawals in some form or fashion...Hell, given that they will be limiting transactions, they could allow a small amount per day and verify the transactions manually just as a show of good faith...
The fact that they have done nothing constructive is troubling and no matter what the end result, they are never going to be trusted again...

The cap removal had little to do with it...Given the 5% inflation rate after the initial coins were mined, it still would have been less inflationary than bitcoin for several years...The hype that drove the popularity just fueled the speculators, and the vast majority of miners were in it for the fun so asic's killed them off.

You mean the fact that the BFL website contained warnings in half a dozen places that the production lead times were "months, and maybe more" and that there was "no guarantee of a return on investment" was not enough?
How about the section saying that refunds were not available because the preorder revenue was seed money to produce the units?  This information was prominently displayed on their website for everyone to see, and as a startup in need of the capital to launch mass production of a new device, these practices seem perfectly legitimate to me...
This will be appealed and I am certain the judgment will be overturned.

I am just tired of seeing that damn chart...If anything we are still in the "awareness" phase anyway, maybe just pushing into the "media coverage" area...So any minute now we should start the spike...and if the "first bull trap" was hitting $1000, hold on you your hats...

However, it is not hard to tell when things have grown beyond your ability to control, and considering they were pulling in tens of thousands of dollars a day, I CAN fault him for not investing in a larger team of more skilled developers...Not to mention the hiring of an ACTUAL CEO who was capable of handling a company with an 8-9 digit net worth....
It boggles my mind that he did not make the obvious decision to put it in the hands of more skilled people...Unless of course, he was aware very early on of leaking funds and did not want new blood coming in and scrutinizing his accounts...

Well, it IS different because it already has DOGE to USD exchanges...The community is huge (it's sub is already 2/3 the size of PR campaigns and more media coverage than any coin other than BTC...Actually has apps being developed for it including mobile light wallets...Is accepted as payment in almost as many places as LTC...
Don't get me wrong, I was only in it for the speculation, bought a shitload around 40 sat and sold out at around 290, but I think it is going to outlast all the other alts by a long shot.
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:33:46
I feel for you...I have been insanely lucky...made a few BTC back when the big DOGE pump happened...Sold/used much of that to build a fairly large GPU altcoin mining rig when the price was still 900...sold off most of the hardware when the price dropped to the low 400s (broke almost exactly even on the hardware depreciation vs mined income) rebought BTC, then liquidated at just over 600 to buy a car right before the current dip...For unplanned, impulsive, and risky choices, things could not have gone much better...Only a matter of time before that shit catches up with me.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:17:22
It's not REALLY news, I mean it is but I don't think the fallout will be that bad...After the last 8-10 hours there were very few people who did not already believe that was the case and we already saw one $100 dip and recovery...

There is ONLY short term for miners...Hardware stays profitable for only a limited time before it needs to be upgraded, and those upgrade costs come from those short term profits...A $10,000 ASIC will make 75% or more of its returns in the first month of operation, then the remaining 25% is a slow curve towards zero profitability for the next couple months...You have to ensure you get what you can while you can when you have 5 figures or more invested.

@_date: 2014-10-05 19:17:21
Depends on your perspective I guess...It is money and the same as USD, eventually EVERYONE is going to dump it...The only difference is that some people are holding long term and hoping that 'dump' will be directly for goods and services rather than simply transferring it back to USD...
Only a fool would use something as a long term store of substantial savings and NOT try to play the market a bit along the way...What sense does it make to watch your savings dramatically rise and fall in value without doing any loss-mitigation/profit taking?
Anyone with a large percentage of their net worth stored in BTC simply HAS to worry about things like this...Anyone who doesn't is either only slightly invested, has a shit-ton of capital elsewhere, or is an idiot...

Plain and simple, Gox's death has been factored into the market for a while now and it was only issues from them that pulled us down for the 800 we were at not long ago.  If you remove Gox from the equation, there has been nothing but positive news for the last several weeks, some of it extremely positive.
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:33:29
I have not been following Bitcoin news as closely as I used to, but wasn't it all but proven in the wake of the Mt. Gox collapse that internal manipulation on their end was what caused the previous run up based on a massive amount of basically 'forged' exchange activity that drove the price so high?
I am still a long term believer in Bitcoin, but it is my understanding, and opinion, that its valuation never should have peaked at the +$1000 mark to begin with and that the subsequent fall to about $4-500 was actually a return to the norm after all the falsified activity was taken out of the market...
Again, I have been out of the loop for a while so if I am wrong about the Gox-hyperinflation let me know...
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:49:12
That uncertainty definitely is taking it's toll...I think Gox's ultimate fate will be somewhat irrelevant as far as the market goes (though I too feel really sorry for those that lose out if they go under).  The market has simply been in a timid holding pattern, not so much waiting to see what the end result is, but rather the rest of the market's reaction to Gox...
No matter what kind of good news may come at this point, it will not be able to overcome that blackhole of uncertainty and actually move the market in a meaningful way.
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:42:06
Well, THAT explains a lot...
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:26:45
Don't get too used to it...I am very bullish right now, but this quick spike in price is people buying speculatively on the recent news...It will likely peak, level, then drop hard as people take a quick profit on the hype...After that the best thing we can hope for is slow, steady continued growth.

@_date: 2014-02-25 05:41:29
I agree, and it is about time the news finally broke...Hell, if it had just died quickly when they first made statements about halting withdrawals, the market would likely have recovered by now...Sucks that it had to happen, but prolonging the inevitable would have only made things worse.
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:58:50
However REQUIRING audits == regulation...Granted the free market will still decide if paying extra for exchange services with higher security/steady public audits is worth the added security.  Thing is, even If we have a market where some exchanges are cheap and less safe while some are more expensive and safer, people who use those cheap exchanges are still going to make claims about needing more security even though they know they willing accepted the risk just to save a few $$.
@_date: 2014-01-25 02:09:13
Again, NOT trying to quantify the effects using these numbers...Merely point out the huge effect DOGE has on the market right now, and given the fact that BTC is the only way to get fiat into and out of DOGE, this huge spike in volume, in my opinion, is probably having some small effect on BTC.

I was messing with a hardware wallet prototype about a year ago, and  with the much faster clock speed, 64K of RAM and 256K Flash it tore through AES and SHA256 like butter...I never finished it just because I could not wrap my head around the math for key pair generation.
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:44:31
SO glad I bought a few more back around $175...I had been out of the game for a while...Better to be lucky than good eh?
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:03:18
Just because a large amount of people are using it does not mean the market cap will ever rival that of fiat...The most likely case, at least near term, is that it will be used as a replacement for things like PayPal and Western Union, being converted to and from fiat.  There will be some people using it for wealth storage, some for daily transactions, but a majority of people will use it to augment the current system rather than replace it.
It may eventually reach 100K, but that will either be many years from now or following a collapse of the US Dollar...We may all be long dead by then though and, as I am guessing, never see it.

I know the software for the trezor was available at one point, but i am not sure about the hardware side...I can send you the very rough 'work in progress' code I started if you want, but it is pretty ugly and not well documented...I had a couple youtube videos up at one point showing the progress and explaining how it worked, but I pulled them when I stopped working on it...
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:38:49
Funny thing is that DOGE is holding up a lot better than LTC considering it was supposed to be a total joke...
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:19:16
The 'unlimited coins' thing is really not an issue though is it?  I mean considering the halving rate of both BTC and LTC, DOGE will still be less inflationary that either of them for a very long time...Now, the eternal optimism point might have some merit. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 20:01:06
Heh, just checking...I was not sure if that theory had been debunked or if people here were still living in happy denial...Honestly, after a fraudulent run up of 250%-500% (depending on when you believe Gox started manipulating things) we are lucky it survived as much as it did.
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:07:18
It has been so encouraging and entertaining to see how the public perception of Bitcoin has changed in the last several months...Despite the dramatic price drop, continued exchange worries, etc. news reports from larger media outlets have drifted towards much more favorable views based on the actual merits of the system, rather than continually sticking to silkroad, gox, and volatility.
Many of my initial worries concerning the likelihood of mainstream adoption are quickly dissolving, and it really feels like we are only a couple of innovative apps away from a popularity explosion...The price may take forever to reach new highs, and we will probably never see '$100K' coins, but it is getting easier and easier to believe that Bitcoin is here to stay.
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:10:07
The problem is, if you have an exchange that is highly secure, implements all these added features, is constantly and publicly audited by 3rd party companies, etc. they are obviously going to charge more for their services...If you haven't noticed, one constant metric by with all the exchange options existing today have been measured is the level of fees they charge...
So, even if we have this hypothetically perfect exchange, a huge number of people are still going to side with the cheapest option, accepting the risk just to save a few $$...Then, when those less secure exchanges get hacked we will be right back in this situation of people wondering how their exchange could be so 'amateurish'...
What I am curious about is just how many hundreds of attempted hacks are thwarted every day...Given the nature of Bitcoin, I would think that it is the most tempting target out there...For a relatively new technology and relatively new companies who can't always afford top notch security/programmers at the outset, this is a VERY rough environment...
@_date: 2014-01-19 13:11:06
Posted a new video showing current progress...Since last time, I have gotten the file IO for both the secure and unsecure SD card worked out and finished most of the associated code.  Currently you can view stored addresses saved on the secure side and import new addresses from the unsecure, storing them on the secure side.  The video contains a demo of how that is done.  I have also added the lock/unlock option, requiring a user defined pass-phrase to be present on the unsecure SD card to allow the device to boot past the splash screen.
The last major process that needs to be implemented is encryption.  I have several libraries to choose from that look like they will be incredibly easy to use, so I don't expect this to take too terribly long to finish.  The user entered text that acts as a lock-code is going to be stored in the devices EEPROM after a hash with SHA-256 so that even if the EEPROM is compromised it will not give up information that will bypass the lock.  As for address encryption, when an address is loaded to the secure card from the unsecure it will undergo some form of AES encryption, which mode depends on how much available RAM I have left when it get to it, but I the libraries I have found offer many options to balance security and performance.
After that, it is a matter of cleaning up...Adjusting the menu system to allow multiple "pages" of addresses if more than 10 are stored, optimizing the code, prettying up the UI, adding error correction, and any other features I decide to add.
In the mean time, if there is anyone out there with a 3D printer that is interested in helping me out with a prototype enclosure, let me know and I will give you details on dimensions and such!

@_date: 2015-01-26 01:32:43
Eh...I really don't know how much I believe that...Anyone who wanted to have a strong position to manipulate the market could have done some massive consolidation over the last few months and any 'whale' would be able to easily push the price on all the main exchanges at the same time...There are still people with tens, even hundres of thousands of coins who could easily push things if they chose to.

Plain and simple, we are NOT going to see main stream adoption in the US until all the legal implications are worked out for companies that provide exchange services, just like we will not see widespread acceptance by large businesses until there is more concrete news on regulatory expectations...
In the mean time, convenience is open to interpretation...This ATM is still easier than going to open a new bank account and waiting to receive a card and pin to use a traditional ATM...

@_date: 2017-03-03 14:23:57
You are not going to get much "rational thought" out of this sub with the price on the rise the way it is...
For what it is worth, I agree with your post.  Everyone here seems to be focused on explaining why Bitcoin is like gold and other traded commodities, but they seem to forget the fact that Bitcoin is *fundamentally* different, which is the whole point.
The SEC can not and should not try to apply the same rules to Bitcoin as it does for physical commodities, which means that in order for this to work it requires a completely new model to be created.
I would love to see this EFT go forward as well, but too many comments on this thread are trivializing the complexity and risk involved and making comparisons to existing markets and funds which have absolutely no correlation.
Bitcoin (which is seen by many as a digital revolution for the global economy) by its very nature does not fit any existing framework.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:49:04
Do they have the BTC?  Probably not, given the daily limits they mentioned...But with the high volume that will/has been bouncing back and forth, I am sure they will recoup enough in transfer fees to match whatever daily limit the impose...
Either way, they will "survive" though they are probably going to lose a large portion of their business.

I really wonder what the charts would look like now, about an hour after the announcement, if they had said, "Hey guys!  Everything is up and running for withdrawals in BTC and fiat.  It is running so smoothly, we don't even need to put a daily cap on transactions.  Sorry for the delay!"...

I specifically said that I am no better.   Back in the EARLY days of Bitcoin, it WAS all about the technology.  You know, long ago when it had no value and someone paid 10,000 BTC for some pizza?
That was the BTC community, and this sub, in it's 'infancy'.  Now, it is all 'all grown up' and all we get are memes and price speculation, which IS sad.

@_date: 2018-10-27 16:28:26
Agreed.  Despite what most people say, myself included, deep down people are just hoping to get rich.  The lofty goals of financial transformation are not REALLY their primary motivation.
Sure, of the people here on this sub, there is likely a higher percentage of people who are 'in it for the technology', but the vast majority of people who have experimented with cryptocurrency are just trying to make some quick cash.
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:59:39
Well, that is at least $153 Billion (by my count), so at a minimum we have another $33 Billion to go, given the current total crypto market cap of $120 billion...
So, that means that if BTC keeps its same market share, we are looking at about $4300 a coin...
Now, if he is ONLY talking about bitcoin...Then that $153 Billion market cap means about $9400 a coin...
BUT...If he meant billions OF billions...Whew...Then we are looking at a total value of $1 x 10^1376 for the market cap (if we assume this is Bitcoin only) and even after everything is mined, each coin will be valued at LEAST $5 x 10^1368...
SO, I'd say Trump is calling the Bitcoin price of $5000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

I vape now, smoked for years...I still enjoy the smell of one burning near me, but I very occasionally steal a single drag off a friend's because that single drag tastes absolutely horrible and removes all desire for more.
I know that after smoking a few that horrible taste goes away, but limiting myself to that single unpleasant experience now and then keeps me from having cravings.

Which dip?  Given the time of your comment, there have been a couple since...
Look, I am not trying to be a troll (I am a huge fan of bitcoin and I have nothing but hope for its future) but this 'don't worry, just BUY!!! There is nowhere to go but UP!!!' advice/propaganda is as bad as advising people to panic sell...
If you had sold at the 'dip' you just bought at, you could be buying back cheaper now and have made about 15%...Hindsight may be 20/20 but blind optimism is blind optimism...

Is there any site showing the breakdown of BCH hashpower by pool?  It seems to me that this coin is VERY vulnerable to attack/manipulation given the huge amount of hashing power out there which could be redirected at any time.
@_date: 2019-10-01 16:58:10
Nah, we are probably in for another ATH...Of course, this will just be another pump and dump orchestrated by the same state-level actors who extracted billions of dollars from the global market during the last boom-bust cycle.
I love the concept of crypto, but people who think it is suddenly going to jump 10x or more in value WITHOUT some major innovation, mass adoption, etc. are fooling themselves if they think such an increase is sustainable/organic.  The entire crypto ecosystem is so heavily manipulated at this point that any major movement should be met with a huge degree of skepticism and the understanding that participating in such a movement in price/value is a gamble on whether or not you can time your activity to coincide with the plans of the 'movers and shakers'.
@_date: 2019-02-24 19:16:33
I mean, selling at 6K and rebuying at 4K is better than holding through that drop, even if it drops lower after the rebuy.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:27:23
Nah, the last bit was not nonsense.  The idea that Bitcoin was created with the primary purpose of testing the blockchain concept.  The success or failure of Bitcoin, in terms of currency, is somewhat irrelevant because as long as other blockchain based systems exist, it's primary purpose has been fulfilled.  
@_date: 2017-04-22 04:28:51
Seriously...This is not the first time there has been controversy like this and if the value actually increases the next fight is going to be even more difficult.

Too many 'experts' claiming to know with absolute certainty the best path through uncharted waters...Too much money and too many inflated egos involved with development...
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:03:57


Sentiments like this are part of why I am losing a lot of faith in crypto to be honest...The whole 'cyberpunk financial revolution' mentality seemed fitting in the beginning, but there is too much real money involved now and too many professionals in the game...You are not really 'fighting the system' when it has become a system in itself...
Rick and Morty nailed it with the line (and I am paraphrasing):

Well shit...Sorry guys, but this one is all my fault...Decided to get back in the game and made my first large buy in a couple years yesterday, so of COURSE, something bad had to happen...

You have factions advocating one code change or another, supporting one developer or another, arguing back and forth like political parties using misrepresented information and personal attacks...Power struggles beginning between developers and the miners...Real and imbalanced power has been consolidated to a small number of individuals in terms of influence and ability to implement changes...Institutionalized money and influence is seeping into the landscape...
I am sorry to step on your unrealistic anrachistic beliefs, but as bitcoin becomes more widespread and more valuable, these influences, rifts in the community, and centralization  of authority (in terms of real power or just tacit consent from users) is going to become even more pronounced...This leads to people and groups effectively gaining guiding control (or governance) over the evolution and implementation of changes...
This IS government, in all but name.
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:00:18
Yeah...While all of the people claiming crypto is a 'Ponzi Scheme' don't know what they are talking about, this last bubble proved that the market is still very prone to manipulation.  A lot of people with money made a shit ton more of it at the expense of those with less.  
While not a 'scam', many people still got played.  Unregulated markets are a double-edged sword.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:39:45
Which is why it is ridiculous to talk about them "deliberately crashing the market".  They want the price as high as possible so they can sell fewer coins and still cover bankruptcy costs, leaving them with more BTC in the end...
Sometimes people here make absolutely no sense.
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:56:40
Eh, it might...It will be years though.  Well, at least it SHOULD be years.  After this, if the price makes another run like the last one, anyone who buys at the high deserves what they get.  
I could see the crypto market getting to that level again, but only if there is actually a reason for it instead of the ridiculous speculation that drove it up this last time.  If we get some actual adoption, daily use-cases, systems and tech relying on the blockchain, etc. then sure...
Triple-digit percentage growth over a short timespan with no real change in the ecosystem is NOT a good thing...
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:53:26


I think everyone is right now...It's the only way things don't look really bad.
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:38:45
For fuck's sake, we saw exactly this happen a couple months ago...The stock market dropped ~10% and Bitcoin went from 11000 to 6000 in a couple days...It followed the exact same pattern as the DOW, just with a larger amplitude.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:27:58
They have nothing to gain from 'crashing' the market, since they are generating fiat to cover bankruptcy debts...The higher the price, the less BTC they need to sell and the more cash/coin will be left when their debt is settled.
If anything, they may simply have had a deadline to come up with $X in fiat and had to sell off a bunch at market value to hit those numbers.  If they are still sitting on 100K+ then why the hell do people think they would deliberately lower the value?
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:31:42


Yeah, he obviously did not make his money investing.  Even if 200K is 'not that much money' for him, he went in big a few percentage points below the ATH...Pretty much the last person who I would take advice from.
I don't consider myself to be the best at reading the market either, but every time I buy, I know exactly what price I will cash out at, for profits or for losses.  I definitely overextended myself on my last position, and when it went down to my 'GTFO of the market' levels, I sold.  Took a 20% hit, which hurt, but it was a hell of a lot smarter than risking the other 30% I would have lost if I was still holding it.
If it ever recovers from this, I have PLENTY of time to get back in, considering where we are now.
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:46:43
Didn't you JUST watch a 10% dip in the DOW chop BTC from 11000 down to 6000 in a matter of days?  It was only a couple months ago...I don't know what world you are living in where money 'flows into crypto' when stocks go down.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:31:57
Exactly, and lowers the value of their remaining BTC.  When all is said and done, they want to sell off as little as possible so that they have as much BTC remaining as they can manage.  They want the price HIGHER, not lower...
If you have a deadline to generate $X, sometimes you have to take a hit on the sale...Obviously, they would have preferred the price to be (and remain) as high as possible so they have to sell fewer coins.
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:42:03
Just 2 months ago, we watched the DOW drop 10% and BTC went from 11000 down to 6000...People have very short memories.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:13:09
The exchange that is closing closes IN two weeks...If you think a 'recovery' is going to happen between then and now, I think you are mistaken and if other Chinese exchanges announce they are closing in the interim, the price goes even lower.
There is a difference between 'panic selling' and making prudent choices.  Hell, I don't even own any crypto at the moment because I am 'in and out' based on market movement.  For me at least, this is NOT the time to go back in because I am not interested in losing all the profit I took the last time I cashed out.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:05:59
Of course, anyone who was smart enough to sell near peak can rebuy now and increase their BTC holdings substantially...What you see a meme-worthy panic selling is referred to by many as prudent investing.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:24:06
Or if he needed to liquidate a large amount, he may have had no choice but to sell.  If this is part of generating fiat to cover bankruptcy proceedings for Mt. Gox, they have absolutely zero incentive to 'crash the market'.  In fact, they would want prices as high as possible so that they have to liquidate as few BTC as possible to cover their debts.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:57:07
Eh, IDGAF what you do either.  I am extremely bullish over the long term, but that does not mean I am not going to look for 'sale prices' and take profit where I can along the way and a big part of that is recognizing and reacting obvious shifts in the market rather than simply holding through them.
This may be something or it may be nothing, however, it is clear that this effect is not completely priced in yet.

We JUST watched the opposite happen less than two months ago.

@_date: 2018-03-07 20:35:08
Exactly...It is silly to think they wanted the price to drop because that just means they have to sell off more coins to cover their debts.  If they had a deadline to come up with $X, they were probably just forced to sell until they hit that mark.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:04:32
The fact that value is still dropping says otherwise...
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:45:04
They are going to have a ton of BTC left over after they cover their bankruptcy costs...They have absolutely no incentive to 'crash the market' since that only lowers the value of what they continue to hold and forces them to sell more to hit the required amount of fiat.
They were likely required (and given a deadline) to generate $X and had to sell accordingly.  It's pretty obvious that they would have preferred higher prices so they could have hit that mark selling fewer coins.
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:20:08
If we get to 50K, I don't think there is any reason to sell.  At that point, BTC will probably be mainstream enough that you can use it for any transaction you would want to make and converting to fiat would be an unnecessary hassle.

Not to be an ass or a grammar nazi, but I cringe a little everytime I see a headline worded this way...Is this some annoying new Internet trend that I am going to have to get used to, or are these just typos that I am starting to be hyper - sensitive to?
@_date: 2018-07-01 20:45:00
I think his point is that for the average user, crypto is still not that enticing.  It's still harder to use, less convenient, and for many people avoiding the fees associated with traditional banking is no worth the extra layer of complexity, risk, and need for security.
And he is right,  crypto still has a long way to go.  That's not to say the banks don't have their own issues and drawbacks, but it will still take time and development before it's ready to go mainstream.

Either of these options is correct...The way 'Like' and 'How' appear in the same sentence is redundant and grammatically incorrect...This incorrect combination has been popping up more and more on reddit and I was asking if this was deliberately written incorrectly because of recent Internet slang, or because people actually believe this is the correct way to say it.

I managed to sell the couple dozen I had at around 600 right before that drop happened...
For me, I will never forget the fact that back in 2010 when I first heard of Bitcoin I thought it was some silly 'credits' for playing online games...I had really good hardware at the time and thought about mining it just for the hell of it, but it looked like too much of a hassle to set up...
Of course, I am probably better off having never owned any at the &lt;$5 mark or I would REALLY be kicking myself because I am positive that I would have sold everything really early on...Or lost my key...

Yeah yeah...You keep holding, I'll keep trading...If/when Bitcoin replaces fiat in the way you are referring to, the careful traders will have made more of a net gain than the long term holders...
Even if you picked up a few hundred or more when they were less than $1, your profit margin (calculated in BTC or USD) would be much higher with some smart market plays...

People are DEFINITELY planning to buy it...This entire BCC split is a planned pump and dump scheme and nothing more.
The BCC price will plummet, then a few days later it will start to skyrocket as the people behind it grab up all the 'worthless BCC' for next to nothing...Then people who don't know any better will see the price rising, buy in, and get crushed when the big players dump at the higher price...
This will probably happen a few times, all because people think they are going to 'get rich' overnight...This is cryptocurrency 101.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:27:07
Funny...I remember quite a few substantial crashes since then...
Sure, it will likely recover, but there is going to have to be a major correction at some point after this crazy growth spurt...I can't claim to know how high it will get before then, or how low it will drop when it happens, but it is going to happen eventually.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:47:04
You are happy because a bunch of people who decided to take the first steps into crypto lost a bunch of money?  That is a pretty bad attitude in my opinion...People have to start somewhere and the trust of 'n00bz' who have little knowledge and experience are going to be necessary to get Bitcoin where we all want it to be.
Most of the money in the market right now is invested with the intention of making more money, not idealists, and most people don't give a shit about the underlying technology...Without the bulk of that investment for profit, we would still be looking at dirt cheap coins, less international interest, less media coverage, etc...
Don't shit on newcomers OR institutional money...Both are needed for long-term growth, adoption, and stability...Otherwise, it is all just tech-nerds trading back and forth as a novelty.
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:18:40
Maybe I am just getting old and cynical, but let's be honest here...People who have/acquire wealth will be able to use the exact same methods, or slightly adapted versions, to aquire wealth even if a full switch is made to crypto...
The reason for this is naivete on the part of some, greed on the part of some others, and the simple nature of economics...It may not be the same people, and 'old money' may temporarily have a new meaning, but there will always be people with more and people with less and those with more have superior means to continue to grow that wealth...If you are talking about freedom and anonymity, this disparity is a part of it.  The only way to avoid this happening would be laws and regulations which fly in the very face of the system you are wanting to create...Economic equality will never exist in a free market.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:41:08

Seriously?  Slaves to fiat?  Are you honestly trying to say that Bitcoin is supposed to lead to weath distribution?  I've got news for you...The people with all the money (fiat) have that money because they provide goods/services/management/etc and receive this money as compensation...Replace fiat with BTC and these same people are still going to receive more than they spend...decentralized or not, this isn't going to change...
BTC can save us from bank fees, delays, 3rd party payments, and what have you, but you are missing the point if you expect it to be some 'great equalizer'...
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:38:57
Just like a 5% drop is now considered a crash...
@_date: 2017-05-04 04:39:00
If you look at recent history, I am expecting a correction down to about 1200 before getting anywhere near 2000...Of course, it is anyone's guess...If we hit 2000 WITHOUT another large correction though, I don't think it will necessarily be a good thing.
@_date: 2017-05-04 04:36:52
Add to that the fact that you can now buy LTC on Coinbase and no longer need to buy BTC as an intermediary...I honestly expected it to take a bit of a hit from that, yet here we are up ~5% for the day.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:59:40
You can't predict what will happen in 5 years, let alone 50...It is entirely possible that some flaw will emerge in Bitcoin, some Alt will slowly drain market share by offering more utility, etc...
A sudden crash in the near future would certainly have the effect you claim, but it is hard to say what will happen given enough time and unforeseen factors...
For example, once things like Lightning are implemented and conversion between coins is 'seamless', it would actually be smart to have value split between multiple networks to prevent, say, a consortium of miners banding together and holding the 'world' hostage...
Is that likely or easy?  Currently no, but if we are suddenly looking at a TRILLION dollar market with serious global impact on day-to-day economies?  Our best chance to avoid such a threat (even if it is minimal) would be to keep the crypto world diversified and in a truly diversified landscape, Bitcoin may slowly lose it's preferred status.
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:26:11
Nope, I am here for lower fees, fast international transactions, and the 'upgrade' of paper money and coinage...There will never be economic equality in a 'free market' and there will never be true 'liberty' in a market that is not free...Those that have wealth will always have the means to increase it, be it fiat or crypto based, and any law/regulation that changes that will remove and semblance of liberty and freedom from the equation.
@_date: 2017-05-04 04:14:39
I don't know...Call me an optimist, but I don't think we HAVE seen this before...
It seems like a much more natural climb this time, with several corrections along the way.  I am sure we are due for another dip soon which might cause a few tears from people who went in heavy at 1500, but I don't see a sudden drop of 1/3 of its value happening overnight any time in the near future.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:51:23
There will be a large amount of money made early on from the dump, yes...This will also be an opportunity for exchanges, businesses, and individuals who already own a large amount of bitcoin to suck up a large percentage of the liquidity.
If you own a large enough percentage of the total market cap, especially in a 'young' currency which will be getting a lot of attention over the next few weeks/months, it becomes trivial to drastically alter the perceived value.
Properly manipulated, more money can be made over the long term than during an initial dump, provided that you have a large enough percentage to bend the market to your will.
The average holder will make more money the earlier they sell, but the major players will create price fluctuations in the remaining low-cap market which will allow them to extract a greater value over time.

I am going to do what I consider rational and not make decisions during periods of high volatility.  I have made some serious gains AND had some serious losses in the past, but am very much 'up' overall and part of the reason for that is that I sit on the sidelines until I have a clear picture of what is going on.
So, maybe?  Like I say, I have been out of the game for a while, so the RATIONAL thing to do is to get a feel for the current market before making any sizable investment, not just buying blindly because the price has plummeted.

The OP is NOT for receiving payments, just for cold storage...Naturally the QR code I have on it in the pictures is a receive address, since I did not want to post a private key and had to give me the chance to throw money at me.
The previous comment was to say that I might eventually try to make something wifi-enabled to either send or receive...The downside of sending is needing the private keys and there have been security issues with the Coinbase API lately so I would rather not enable it just to test things...

That is definitely going to be the biggest problem Bitcoin faces.  People that are careful will love the security and anonymity of it, but a majority of the public unfortunately relies on the form of security offered by banks and organizations like Paypal.

Maybe so, but I overinvested at the time.  I lost a couple hundred dollars, but if I had held I would be down several thousand.  Considering the value has dropped by about 80% since then and never returned to a point higher than where I sold, I absolutely made the right call at the time.

Nobody can answer that, because nobody knows...In 6 days, 60 days, or 60 months the price could be $0.01 or $10000...If you don't already have experience day trading, you would be much better off simply holding at this point and not trying to make quick profits buying and selling...

So...How is this any different than bruteforcing the address to begin with, considering they contain an even smaller set of ascii characters? If you have a sufficiently long key to avoid repetition which containins a broader number of possible bit combinations from special characters, you will end up with as many, or more, possible outcomes as there are private keys wouldn't you?
Edit:  And when I say sufficently long, I mean 25 character+ string...encoding, let's say a 50 character string which will have the leading 5 removed and added back after decryption...

You can...They are still a little harder to find and considerably more expensive than LCD at the moment, but given a little more time I am sure that will change.  If I remember right, they are cheaper and easier to produce than LCD, but there are already so many LCDs left over from the last few years that they have been dirt cheap...
For example, the 1.8" LCD I ordered was $20 (and if it did not have the built in microSD card reader, probably more like $12), whereas an eInk/ePaper Screen of the same size would currently be around $40.

The term "whistleblower" is grossly over used nowadays...I would agree the word would be appropriate if the information he leaked was limited to evidence of domestic spying, government against it's own citizens, but he went much much farther than that and released documents detailing intelligence gathering operations on the global scale...We don't even know the extent of the information he stole, but you can damn well bet that before Putin granted him asylum and allowed him to transmit information to the Guardian, Putin's men combed through those files and took what they wanted first.
More accurate words for this are espionage, subterfuge, and treason...If a Russian spy infiltrated MI5, stole files detailing the UK's entire intelligence operation home and abroad you would not call them a hero just because they released some information that made Britain look bad...Of course, Snowden was not a foreign operative which in many ways makes the situation worse, namely fitting the definition of treason and making him an enemy of the state.
As for you questioning my moral character and motivation, I took an oath and willingly risked my life to defend my country and it's people.  I don't care what your opinion was about Iraq or Afghanistan because the merits of those conflicts do not change the commitment I made to this country, as I could just as easily been ordered to defend US soil with my life rather than being sent to the middle east under different circumstances.
As for how this ties in with Snowden, my primary job in the military at the time was communications security, and I know all too well what the consequences can be when this security is compromised...It can be the difference between people you know and trust engaging the enemy as planned or walking into an ambush.  It is information like this that he put at risk, against similar oaths that government employees given access to classified information also take and as such betrayed trust.
This man has undeniably compromised US intelligence operations FAR beyond the domestic surveillance operations he is celebrated for exposing, which directly and indirectly endangers soldiers, agents, and citizens in the long term.  I am not a fanatic, zealot, sociopath, psychopath or maniac simply because I want justice brought to a man that wantonly endangered the lives of possibly thousands of people who work to protect this nation, and as someone who swore and oath to defend the nation from "all enemies, foreign and domestic" I would not hesitate to pull the trigger myself.
EDIT:  Of course you will probably not actually read all of this, and since your own opinion is already made it will not change anything, but I was bored during lunch and decided to type this up anyway.  Good luck to you as well, and be glad that you have a few people like me looking out for you and your nation's interests as well.  We don't give a flying fuck whether you like us or not, but we keep you safe.

Lots of work to do to it yet...Mainly modify the scripts I have found to generate QR codes (they are MUCH more complicated than you think...) and add a microSD reader.
The eventual goal is to be able to store several private keys on the SD card and seal everything in a weather resistant enclosure.  
I imagine the whole thing will cost me about $80 in total (controller, OLED, battery, SD card &amp; reader, case), probably could get it down as low as $35-40 if I was more careful about sourcing parts.  Should come out being about 2" x 3" x .5".  When I am done I will probably make some kind of DIY post somewhere about it if there is interest.
EDIT:  Also a device specific encryption algorithm on the SD card of course so nothing else can read it, toggle between QR code and plain text display, and cycle through multiple addresses saved on the card.
**EDIT 2**  Thanks for all the feedback, suggestions, and interest everyone!  A big thank you as well to the couple anonymous donations I received!  They, and any other donations, are much appreciated and will all be spent at [Adafruit]( for parts.

I made no unsupported prediction, in fact I explicitly stated that I was NOT making the prediction that Bitcoin will ever be anywhere near as prevalent as debit cards are now.  I also said that the debate on why some businesses choose to accept these fees and some don't is an entirely separate conversation.
As to my " judicious use of + and =" you have to be deliberately missing the obvious meaning, which is that debit cards are a technological improvement on paper checks, and Bitcoin is a similar technological evolution of actual cash.
Also, there are no incorrect facts in my initial statement...People who normally would not have used credit cards and would have instead paid by check, began using debit cards which are functionally the same and carry the same processing fees as credit cards.  This increase in popularity lead more businesses to accept them as a form of payment than were before.
The exact same thing can be said of the businesses choosing to accept Bitcoin now, they see that the popularity of the system out weights the effort, risk, and overhead involved in the process of doing so.  Not everyone agrees, and so not everyone is currently, nor will they ever, make the choice to accept them, despite the fact that the risk involved in volatility is completely mitigated by online services that will immediately convert these payments into fiat.  This, minus the aforementioned risk, is precisely the same view some businesses currently have about accepting credit/debit cards now.

Not sure...I could easily add a micro USB charge cell and a tiny LiPo battery, but I might just go with a couple of 25mm Coin Cells.  The final version should be pretty low on power consumption, and since it is intended for long term storage with minimal usage, recharging is not that high on my list right now.  Though if I ever plan a production run I would base that decision on popular opinion.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:31:05
No longer cost effective...My pair of $400 video cards make me about $0.25 a day mining by kicking out about 1GH/s...Back in July I ordered a 5GH/s ASIC for ~$300, which STILL won't arrive for another month or so...If I had that ASIC back in July it still would have only netted me about $10 a day and when I finally get mine in a month after waiting 6 months in the production queue, it is likely to only give me ~$1 a day even at current prices...
The increase in block difficulty, the exponential increase in the total network hash rate, and the lead time ordering hardware means that you will only break even on the cost of new hardware if the value increases another hundred fold...Which of course will prompt many more people to mine, and so on...
Factor in the cost of electricity and it becomes even harder...My GPU mining sucks up about .75KW/hour...Thankfully where I live I don't have to pay an electric bill, so I don't have to worry about it.
Side note:  If, at the time, I had spent that $300 I paid for an ASIC buying coins, that $300 would have turned into about $3500...As it is now, I still have nothing to show for it.
TL;DR:  If you can't mine already, buy BTC on an exchange with the money you would use for hardware and you will be much better off.

However, if you are holding BTC in quantities that total to millions and still see the potential for an increase in value or as a viable method for long term storage, why would you ever choose to cash out all at once?  I am not going to pretend like I have a degree in economics, but rather apply some common sense...
If bitcoin is able to reach a point of adaptability, global acceptance, and stability that allows it to reach levels of $10,000 then it has proven its ability as a strong medium for storing value...Why in that case would someone choose to transfer it back to the format it has successfully replaced?

The Chinese as a population are barely recognizable as communist anymore and are very much interested in making money...Considering where a a large portion of tech factories are located, I would have a hard time believing that they are not kicking out ASICs in large enough quantities for low enough cost that some people are making a killing.  That, plus the fact that BTC gives them an option to dodge their government and make untraceable international purchases leads me to think that it is more than speculation.  What this really means for the future is still anyone's guess of course.

I briefly worked for a credit verification company and used those multiple choice verification systems regularly...They are usually extremely accurate, as all the information used to generate the questions comes directly from your credit report and generally only creates one "trick question" with no correct answer if you don't have much credit history to work with...If you had that much trouble getting the 3/4 that is usually required for verification, I would take a VERY long look at all three of your credit reports and make sure there is nothing "unusual"...

Good chance that it has something to do with the time of day I usually check at.  I am in South Korea at the moment, so prime time for me is usually during the middle of the night for a majority of the Coinbase users in the US, so the decreased trade volume around that time probably is the main factor. That said, 972 Buy and 966 sell are the prices I am being offered as of 0800 my time, which is 1500 PST and 1700 CST, still what I consider to be normal trading time ranges...
 seems the same as 3... is the main factor in my opinion too, but I never saw a spread of more than 20 USD or about 2% even when the price was dropping 20% last night... I am pretty sure we are looking at the same thing...The sell for USD tab vs the buy BTC tabs... it is possible also...I don't want to ask or tell how much either of us have invested with them right now, so I am not sure if the value of our accounts could have and effect or not...(if you want to discuss that more in detail you can PM me).

I know we all love the idea that the government can't regulate BTC, but if legitimate merchants are prohibited from officially accepting payment, exchanges are shut down, or any number of other things you can lose everything.

My plan for encryption involves a random number hard seeded on the microcontroller itself, followed by some bit masking...On booting it will check each key to see if it has been encrypted yet and then overwrite the existing file if not...Not %100 unhackable, but no way to simply pop the SD card back into a PC.

Hmm...Not sure...It is a bit expensive/overkill in some ways, but at the same time it is really low on program memory and ram...It is possible it would work, but I don't think it can handle all the processing requirements...512 bytes is not much to work with.

Raw binary, yes.  I am going to test quite a few senarios trying to deliberately corrupt the data stored in NVRAM to make sure it is stable, but there should be no need for error checking as long as there are no errors thrown by the initial read from the SDcard.

This OLED was one of a couple that came off a kickstarter from a few months ago.  Unfortunately it was a single run, so if I ever make more of these I will need to source some new ones (probably go e-Ink) and recode things a bit.  And yes, it is going to get cleaned up soon.  Still too young to be pretty...lol

Which market are you comparing it to?  Coinbase's buy and sell prices are both considerably higher than BTC-e rates for example.  As I am writing this BTC-e shows the value at $995 while Coinbase has a buy price of $1092 and a sell price of $1085...Also, when I bought $900 worth a few days ago I only paid a $9 fee, which is only 1%...
Or are you talking transferring in and out of your coinbase wallet?

Given the application here, which is to encrypt the key into a cipher that will be stored in the NVRAM of a microcontroller split into several memory addresses rather than printed out or copied to a PC, even externally accessing the data reliably is difficult...Brute forcing the device itself would require cycling power on each attempt (3-5 seconds) and hot-wiring the IO pins of the SD Card reader to bypass the further need to change the data on the SD Card each time...
Edit:  The whole point is, that while no form of encryption is unbreakable, this method  combined with the difficulty in accessing even the encrypted data, should serve as a suitable security option for cold storage...of course, I could go even further and use a device specific random seed to mix the encrypted bytes in an array, but that seems like overkill unless someone attacks the chip with an electron microscope...

Just cheap, easy, well supported, and most importantly: available.  I have also played around with Pic, Galago, CoAction, and a couple other ARM boards, but for what I am doing this works just as well as anything else.

It will display plain text as well...QRs save you a lot of time and potential typos though if you are entering multiple addresses without the ability to copy and paste.

You could look into creating cards with custom QR codes on one side and art work on the other and either sell them separately or offer them with purchases of prints...Just like all these custom cellphone cases, if/when things go mainstream people are going to be looking for trendy and flashy ways to accessorize, be good to get in early.
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:38:56
I am not disputing that BIP38 is better, though I am not sure how well it can be ported to avr...
Theoretically though, since you are running an XOR on each bit pair, the randomness is equally effective on either side of the operation...it might as well be the address encypting the passphrase if all you see is the cipher...I can't fathom the math...but even with a single bit ciphered into 01110110 there are an insane number of ascii pairs that will generate the same result...Raise 25 to the power of whatever that last number was and you have the maximum number of possible combinations...
Now obvioulsy using somethine like "I love my mother, her name is Mary" is not nearly as secure as a random string, but since the decryption key string will be saved on a SDcard and removed, the intended use is something much more "cryptic"
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:10:01
Well essentially it will be as secure as the user wants it to be anyway given the chosen complexity of their key choice...and encyrption will be an option, not a neccessity and keys loaded in can always be in BIP32 before hand...Physical security of a cold wallet is still paramount after all.
For all practical purposes though, given the bit manipulation, I still think that the key and the data are essentially equal in importance...encrypting a random block of characters with a predictable block of key characters would be the exact same cipher if you used the random block of characters as the key to encrypt the predictable block of characters instead.
10110101 XOR 11010100 is the same result as 11010100 XOR 10110101

Good eye!  This screen came from a Kickstarter campaign from a few months ago...Unfortunately it was a single run, so I can't get more of them...Think they were 15-20 each or so.
When I Finish the code for true QR generation I will post it somewhere...The one displayed here was actually hand-jammed in as a hardcoded  bit-array...The only QR libraries that seem to exist so far are not in the right format (no lowercase letters and not enough data) and re-writing it to do what I need is going to be rough.

There are a couple different ways I might go about this and I am far from the point in the project where I am going to decide for sure, but here are a couple options I have been considering...
Some involve masking and overwriting the original file on the SD card, some involve swapping the address into device memory and replacing the file on the SD card with a unique random access key...
When the time comes, I will do more research into encryption methods and the possible ways memory may be accessed on the microcontroller I am using...
What I am leaning towards is modifying the keys, as stored on the SD card, by masking it with bits from a random long integer and overwriting...It will not be IMPOSSIBLE to crack, but it would not be as simple as reading the SD card...
Now if someone gets the device and the SD card at the same time, it would be just like them finding a paper wallet unless it was encrypted before hand...

I think it all depends on the ratio of fiat to BTC they raked in.  If I were running a small business, I would do my best to keep whatever profit I made from sales in BTC and only cash out what I needed to cover costs, if any.
It also depends on the motivation of the business owner of course and whether or not their choice to accept bitcoin on Black Friday was for marketing purposes or legitimate belief in the currency and the potential for investment.
Personally, I am inclined to hope (if not believe) that the steady increase in value the last week or two, not to mention the positive attention the currency is recieving, provides enough incentive for anyone who was already willing to take on the risk of accepting bitcoin to hold on to as much as possible for the time being.

Yes and no...I have found libraries in a couple of places but they will all involve some serious rewrites because they are either overly complex or not functional enough, not to mention the completely wrong language...I will probably use some existing code as a base, but given what I need it might actually be quicker to start from scratch.

Yeah, I will definitely only be programming version 3 in binary because I need ISO 8859-1 and the addresses are fixed length...I have not had the time yet to do anything more than browse the standards, but at first glance it was the error correction that gave me pause.  Good thing is, I don't REALLY need to understand it, just modify some existing code (I love the internet).

What I need is something that will take the string of raw text and process it into binary mode version 4 so that it will support the full ISO 8859-1 character set...The output I am looking for is an array holding the code in pixel form, most likely a two dimensional byte array, which can be read sequentially to output to the screen.  C is basically the language used by the Arduino IDE with a few tweaks specific to it.  
I have found C libraries, but it will be necessary to study them in detail and trim out everything that is not absolutely vital to operation since most of them do much much more than the single case I need to work with...The problem is, I only have 2K RAM and about 20k in program memory for work with, and a good chunk of that needs to be saved for SD card IO and the libraries for  the display.

The problem, and I hate to say it, is that some people NEED these layers of BS security.  I am hopeful that Bitcoin takes off, am using it, and am fairly well invested in it.  It is for some people a far superior system, and I can't imagine it's growth not continuing to increase exponentially...
That said...All this hassle keeps stupid people (no offense to anyone, just generalizing) safe...I think we all love the concept of digital cash, but for some people this will never be accepted.  We have anonymity, speed, and universality but with that comes a lack of oversight and accountability that too many people today rely on out of ignorance...
I have already read several stories about people getting scammed by Black Friday sites, which due to the nature of the currency will never be resolved...Your average consumer will not take the time, nor know how, to ensure a site is legit when making online purchases let alone safeguard wallets...
Part of Bitcoin's success I think it going to be heavily tied with educating people on responsible uses of technology...Otherwise, a large portion of the population will continue to accept the bullshit run-around in this post as the price we pay for security.

I am not so sure we need them all that much...They may push through walls, the the volatility they cause with market manipulation is detrimental to public perception.  For those holding it all averages out in the end, but to business owners who are thinking about accepting bitcoin as payment, the charts are terrifying and do not inspire confidence in long term stability.  It also does not bode well for the system as a whole that it is so prone to the whims of large holders.

Question to anyone who has used coinbase for a while:
Does the processing time get shorter after your first purchase, or remain about 1 week long?
I signed up, verified my ID, and purchased 1 BTC on the 26th, which will arrive on 3 Dec...I know from the verification page that you are not considered Level 2 until your first purchase is complete, but I have not found info on Level 2's effect on the transaction time.
It is obvious that the only way for instant processing is to link a credit card (being Visa only at the moment I can't do that anyway) which I am not too concerned with, but I am hoping this drops to 2-3 business days rather than a full week after verification...Though due to the nature of BTC, I would assume that bank holidays and weekends would have no effect.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:55:29

EDIT: Side note...I was thrilled a couple hours ago when the USD I had sitting on BTC-e in a buy order caught the fall to about 865, but now I really wish I had left it down around the 800 it was at for a while before that...

I briefly worked for a credit verification company and used those multiple choice verification systems regularly...They are usually extremely accurate, as all the information used to generate the questions comes directly from your credit report and generally only creates one "trick question" with no correct answer if you don't have much credit history to work with...If you had that much trouble getting the 3/4 that is usually required for verification, I would take a VERY long look at all three of your credit reports and make sure there is nothing "unusual"...
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:14:51
Yeah, that's the position I am in...Bought some mid-pay-cycle and wanted to catch some more after payday but locked because of the transaction time.  So the week-long wait persists even after your first purchase without a CC, or does it at least shorten slightly?

Yes, eInk is another thing that is on my list of future upgrades.  The main thing stopping me right now is price and availability.  In the spirit of the project, all parts that I order I want to be paid for in BTC but the only supplier I have found so far that DOES has been Adafruit.  While Adafruit has a decent selection/price for many things, when it comes to eInk they don't have anything that looks attractive.

The point is eliminating the need for cash.  If it gets to the point where it is that valuable and a retailer does a high percentage of their business in bitcoin, it stands to reason those in the supply chain would accept it as well.  You worry about places running out of cash paying people that want to convert BTC into dollars, but the whole point is that BTC will be just as easy to transfer and spend so the whole need to ever "cash out" would no longer exist.
I am not saying this is ever going to happen, but if bitcoin rises in value to the point where this could become a concern, there will no longer be a reason to be concerned.  Why would anyone want to have a briefcase full of 20 dollar bills when they can scan a QR code on their phone and transfer 3x as much?

I spend where I can and keep re-buying...The the only reason spenders are a minority is that there are still so few places it can be spent.  Sure there are people that will always hold, but the more places start accepting it, the more money will be put into the market.
I, for example, only have the option to spend BTC online at the moment, so any disposable income I have that I envision needing to spend stays in fiat.  Alternatively, if I know a certain portion of my monthly expenses can be paid for in BTC then I will be converting a larger percentage of my paycheck into coinage...If I can eventually pay for rent, food, gas, etc with BTC then I will likely convert almost everything, considering that IF we get to that level of saturation the market cap will be so high that market volatility will be minuscule.
