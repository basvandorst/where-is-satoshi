How would you classify BTC that are not "stored" on the exchange in the traditional sense, and are not "in use" by the depositer in the traditional sense, but are lent out to margin traders ala Bitfinex or Poloniex?  If the BTC are "tied up" in an open position, does that make them any less vulnerable to loss via vulnerability?

Good point.

No shit.  And with a 14 second block time for ETH, its not like you couldn't keep funds securely stored on a hardware wallet and move them in, make a trade and then move them out relatively quickly.  Although I'm playing with substantially less than 90k, that's exactly what I do, and for that reason.

Oh I don't know enough about it to know what a good adoption rate is... I was just commenting on your comparison of bitcoin(more borderless) to USD(less borderless).
@_date: 2016-04-23 11:41:53
Your logic doesn't make sense. First you increase the group you're comparing against to "internet users", but then you compare it to USD adoption, which naturally would have a much lower adoption rate outside the US. If you're gonna make a comparison like that, increasing the group to something borderless like " internet users", then I think you also need to increase what you're comparing to something that's also borderless...
For example, what's the adoption rate of fiat currency in general.  I think that's the natural analog of bitcoin in this scenario.

I was wondering this too. While Bitcoin and OpenBazaar themselves allow trade without outside interference, if you're trading in real physical goods that need to be delivered from one party to another then I think you're not immune to outside interference. If I'm wrong I'm sure someone more knowledgeable can correct me.

Of course lying in a contract is illegal but no contract was mentioned and neither does your example.
Anyone can also send an email that at first glance appears to come from "president or any other address. My question is if that action, in and of itself is inherently illegal.
@_date: 2015-06-23 16:11:38
Would both actually be criminal?  I understand that since the government controls the fiat then faking a bank statement would be criminal, but if there is no centralized entity that controls or oversees Bitcoin or the blockchain or signed messages, would it actually be criminal to do this?
 
I'm not trying to be a smartass, I'm just honestly wondering this because I don't know enough about it.

I just wanted to mention that while Bitcoin Hackathon registration is free, registration for the NABC is $150 per person which is way too high for this sort of thing if you ask me.  My company was able to send me to CES last year as an industry affiliate with free registration.  It's a shame that NABC doesn't do something similar.
Plus, they're using Ticketmaster for the tickets, so there's probably a load of surcharges as well.
@_date: 2014-12-19 12:57:04


I just checked this out.  I'd love to go, but $200 tickets are just more than I'd spend for this sort of thing.  It's a shame because I'm just up the road from Miami.  I guess I'm spoiled after my company sent me to CES last year, and the registration was free for industry people.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:39:44


  
  
And we're still gonna charge you $150 per person to participate in the Q&amp;A, plus Ticketmaster's fees.
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:06:04
I never said I expected it to be free.  I'm just pointing out that $150 is a bit exorbitant for this event considering I can get into CES as an industry affiliate for $0.
  
Maybe my post was slightly off topic, yes.  I just think it's clear that the organizers were profiteering by letting Josh Garza be a title sponsor, and trying to profiteer even more by opening up this QA session which will bring more money into their event.

Yes as I said I understand your privacy and anonymity concerns, but for whatever reason you don't want your car payment tx to be pegged to your name, now its pegged to your friends name?  You sound like a really good friend, lol.  And to take your example of "one person at a time" further, what happens when your friend who's making your car payment decides that he too wants to ditch fiat completely?  Then how is your car payment going to get paid?  Is he going to have to find a third person who's still using fiat?  See what I mean?  
  
And also, who cares who is doing the fiat to BTC conversion.  The fact is you're pretending you don't use fiat at all, when in fact you do.  Just because its not you who does the BTC to fiat conversion, doesn't mean that the person you're paying isn't getting fiat, which is what you're trying to avoid.
@_date: 2016-06-08 16:01:18
I'm totally with you on all your points.  Here's how I handle it:  
  
I get paid in USD.  I take my salary minus any large bills (rent, car payment, insurance, etc) and transfer the difference to my KeepKey as BTC for long term storage. So the only USD left in my bank account is what I need to pay my large bills.  
  
Then I have a Shift Visa card connected to my CoinBase account.  Usually a few times a week I will transfer a small amount of BTC from the KeepKey wallet into my Shift card, which I can then use anywhere I can swipe a Visa card, so that covers my daily expenses.  
  
For larger purchases I try to buy online and use BTC if it's accepted, and if not I can always transfer a little more into the Shift card.  
  
So I'm pretty much always covered.  If I need a small amount of fiat I have the card, and the rest is stored in my secure wallet that only I have the keys to.  So in the event of this civil forfeiture bullshit, that cop can swipe my Shift card and get the $50-$100 I have on there.  Pain in the ass sure but not a major problem.  
  
Edited to say that by using the Shift card yes I'm still prone to all the purchase tracking that comes with using a Visa card, and while I disagree with it, it has not personally affected me in my daily life, so I just accept it.  If in the future it becomes a problem then I suppose I will just exchange the BTC directly to fiat cash that wouldn't likely be tracked (although now that I think of it, those bills all have serial numbers on them so it may be just as bad).
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:49:11
Uhhh...  
  
In case you didn't realize it Cashila, Bitwala, Bitbill, etc are turning your BTC into fiat and sending that fiat to whoever you denote (to pay your bills, etc).  The only difference is that it's not YOU who's converting to fiat, it's the service you're using.  
  
So what's the difference if I load some BTC to my Shift card and use it to pay a bill directly, and if you pay a bill via Cashila, which turns your BTC into fiat also?  
  
And if you think the grocer and your landlord who you convinced to accept BTC as payment are not converting that BTC into fiat at some point, well then you're just blind.  
  
It's just reality that until the majority of value is stored via BTC, then fiat will be used more commonly.  Yes it's great to promote BTC for all the reasons you mentioned above including anonymity, I think it's very shortsighted to pretend that your BTC is not being exchanged to fiat at some point in the process.
@_date: 2016-06-08 16:41:11
Yeah I get that about tracking cash serial numbers.  It's just a thought that entered my mind, that's all.  And no I'm not really too worried about civil forfeiture where I live.  I also don't have a lot of "intereaction" with the police, so while it's concerning that it happens it's not a daily fear of mine.  
  
But as for keeping most of my money in BTC, that's another story.  It's not all that much hassle and for me it does have very real benefits.  There has been more than one occasion that (keeping details simple to avoid being identified) money in my bank accounts was "unavailable" (that's the nice way of saying it) for some time, and if those funds were in BTC they could have been used.  So, for me it's definitely worth it.  YMMV of course.
@_date: 2017-01-03 03:54:36
Also true.
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:35:06
Agreed.  I didn't see the "never sold" part when I first read it.
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:20:55


  
Based on what?  Daily closing prices?  You're aware that there are shorter trading periods than one day right?  There were plenty of opportunities to lose money and lots of people have.  
  
I think it's pretty disingenuous to say that there's only been 9 days in Bitcoin history when people have lost money and any informed trader would see right through that statement.
@_date: 2016-11-12 13:43:27
I love these stories...  
  
**SWIFT wasn't hacked.**  A terminal in a bank was compromised.  The bank was using $10 secondhand network switches with no firewall enabled.  This is like saying "Bank of America got hacked" because you left your laptop unlocked and someone compromised it and used it to steal your money from the bank.

This article doesn't go into any detail about the grocery store location.  Does this guy own the location? Judging by what little information is in the article and pictures, it sounds like he's just some dude renting a rack at a colo facility and he put 12 AntMiner S3/S5 in there, only 7 of which are running right now.
 
IDK, this just hardly looks newsworthy to me.  I mean 8 months ago I had 4x AntMiner S4 running in my living room generating more hashrate than this guy and nobody wrote an article about me.

I'm guessing that a state sponsored party with access to spend 450M isn't gonna just ring up Bitmain and ask how many miners they have in stock.  With that much capital and access to technology they can just build their own miners.

@_date: 2015-10-27 20:21:38
OK so I might have used the wrong words in my post, so let me reword it:  
So, the current network hashrate is about 466 PH/s at the moment.  Obviously this is what's required with the current usage of Bitcoin.  I thought that was a given in this context. Sorry if "exorbitant" was the wrong word.  
Anyway, let's pretend that the last Bitcoin was mined today, and beyond that, miners will only be validating transactions.  Will that 466 PH/s be required in order to validate transactions or will it suddenly become overkill?
    
Also, once the last Bitcoin is mined, does the difficulty drop to zero?  What effect would this have?  Sorry, this question is asked out of ignorance.  I just don't understand completely.
  
EDIT: On another note, your timeframe for when the last Bitcoin will be mined ("same as between the invention of the airplane and now") is off by about 13 years.  Everything I have read says the last one will be mined in 2140 at the current halving rate.

And further, since you seem to be responding to the fact that OP lost his money and relating that to federal protections, let's not forget that in the fiat equivalent of OP's situation (losing one's wallet), the federal protections in place would have done absolutely nothing to help OP.  If his money was in a bank, yes the FDIC insurance would have covered it if it was a bank error.  Likewise if OP's BTC was stored in an insured wallet like a Coinbase or similar account he would have had at least some protection.  Not that I'm arguing for keeping one's BTC in an online exchange rather than your own paper wallet with appropriate protections.  I'm just comparing apples to apples here.
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:17:57


  
Really? A $400 miner that's not going to earn anything tangible is a great way to get into mining?  You could spend about a third of that and get a ton more horsepower.
@_date: 2016-05-15 05:59:02
OK I suppose I should thank you for clarifying Alabama's context in this as it isn't clear from your previous comment or OP's post...
But aside from that I really don't care about your good luck with the BBB.  The fact stands that they are absolutely NOT a regulatory agency and have no jurisdiction or ability to enforce anything whatsoever beyond the threat of a complaint in their own database.  They are the brick &amp; mortar version of today's Yelp, and nothing more.  If your stance is that some bad press would get them to cave and give OP's funds back, he would probably have better luck with a good smear campaign on the usual social media outlets.  
  
I'm glad you've had good luck lodging complaints with them, but if you're giving out advise to people you should start by advising OP to consult a governing body with the ability to actually enforce anything.  
  
IANAL but I would suggest that OP consult either the US Treasury Dept. and / or an attorney, but a quick glance at Coinbase's user agreement section 6.3 shows that they prohibit use in Iran or by Iranians, so that's probably why OP's account got killed.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:45:15
Holy shit what a load of crap.  
I am thoroughly stumped by the math concepts he talks about in his "Sartre" blogpost so I don't know much about the inner workings of Bitcoin, but I can see thru this bullshit in an instant.  It amazes me that some real insiders even appear to lend this guy any credibility.  
  
Several times he alludes to doing things involving "early" blocks, but never a mention of the genesis block.  Then the part about "Simply signing messages or moving bitcoin would never be enough for Gavin."  Why wouldn't signing a message be enough?  Isn't that kinda the only thing that would be "enough"?  If he was Satoshi wouldn't he know that?  And furthermore wouldn't he know that Gavin would know that? Isn't that the whole point of the ability to sign something?  
  
Then he goes on to talk about what he's going to do in the coming days involving posting documents and evidence, and more about moving coin from an early block (again not the genesis block).  
  
He sums it up by saying "For some there is no burden of proof high enough..." but pretty much everyone who's doubting him has said **exactly** what acceptable "proof" would be, and if he was indeed Satoshi it shouldn't be too difficult or risky for him to provide that in order to end all the questions.  
  
I dunno man... I mean the guy is widely accepted to have been involved in the very early times of Bitcoin.  He is a PhD (although in theology).  He does seem to hold several CS related certifications and qualifications.  What I'm getting at is that the guy obviously knows a thing or two about CS, cryptography, and Bitcoin.  He certainly doesn't seem like a dumb guy.  But he appears to be doing **dumb** things and it just doesn't make much sense to me.  
  
I guess we will find out soon enough what his real endgame is. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:04:00
Ummm, no that's NOT the point.  The comment I replied to is making the statement that 12 BTC is not a lot.  I argue that many people would consider 12 BTC or $3000 a lot of money.  Whether or not that money is federally insured or not is not relevant to the claim that the original comment that I replied to makes.
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:56:25
Yeah I've seen others allude to this as well, and it does seem to make sense.
@_date: 2015-10-16 14:31:44
And when they turn on their stockpiled miners again, the difficulty shoots back up.
@_date: 2015-10-12 03:21:12
That's not the point. The point is, you say that 12 bitcoin is not a lot of bitcoin, but its worth nearly $3000 today and I'm willing to bet most people would consider that a lot of money regardless of how much of a percentage it is of the total number of bitcoin.
Again, if $3000 was gone from your bank account and unrecoverable, I'm very sure you'd think it's a big deal, even though that $3000 is a ridiculously small percentage of the $1.39 trillion in circulation.

This question may be better suited for but do you know how important hashrate will be once all the bitcoins are mined and miners are only validating transactions?  Will the exorbitant network hashrate suddenly  be way overkill for the task of validating transactions or is it just as computationally intensive as finding blocks?
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:28:05

@_date: 2016-05-03 19:07:27
No I get what you're saying.  
  
What I'm saying is that he's not dumb.  It remains to be seen if he's a scammer or up to something shady but I think we can all agree that he is an intelligent man.  And so I think we can assume he knows that Gavin is also an intelligent man, and by the nature of Bitcoin itself, most people who would know enough to question his motives would be reasonably intelligent as well.  
  
So he's smart, and he *should* know that we're all pretty smart too.  So then why waste time trying all these seemingly dumb things that will be instantly shot down?  Still makes no sense to me.  Unless he's just going to take the community's incoming shitstorm and try to capitalize off of the people who don't know better than to question him.
