One day Hollywood will bring us a comedy/biopic movie about the rise of bitcoin and the wacky characters involved (along the lines of The Big Short), and they will DEFINITELY draw quotes directly from this thread.

I think of Montana as one of those places that attracts off the grid living libertarian rugged individualists, like Alaska lite. Pockets of bitcoin adoption there would make sense to me . . . like Ron Swanson and his gold bullion.

The difference between a rumor and a good quality leak is pretty huge for people. You can't convince anyone to fix what you can't even confirm exists.

You can't trust someone to give it to you physically and just "forget" the private key. The transfer isn't done until it's claimed

You should read some of the press from the time of the Snowden leaks. It's a combination of legal, unique hardware, and brute force tools that complement typical cryptographic tech, which gives the NSA its edge. While they don't resort to the wrench as far as anyone knows, it's more like the old XKCD comic than not.  It's not "crack this key, computer", it's "sign this other key, sir". Gag orders and leverage from existing monetary entanglements are the big trump card. Corporations have too much money at stake to risk any of their revenue stream or missing quarterly goals on some legal fight that could existentially threaten those revenue streams. Joe Nacchio of Qwest exemplifies that (he was a criminal, and tried to exploit the secret information to do insider trading; they just pulled the secret rug out from under him and showed enough to the SEC to send him to jail; at that point, he was no longer interested in cooperating, so it's slightly out of order but goes to show how easy it is to lose in that confrontation). There was a large number of very straightforward hardware tools for spying; They sounds unrealistic for any normal person, but using gag orders, shipments would be intercepted and tampered with.
There is very rarely any opportunity to use a brute force directly against cryptography, but it's just not for lack of trying. Every time we read about some bug that needs to be patched, or some configuration peccadillo (key size, etc.) creating a cryptographic weakness, there's also probably some target that's unpatched, making another opportunity they can look at exploiting. There is massive storage dedicated to pitting last year's crypto vs. next year's hardware, too, so supposedly, they will be exploring old troves of encrypted information in the event that they are eventually able to.  That may or may not work but it doubles as a scare tactic to keep people from encrypting data.

It's an interesting point . . . There are slightly different ways of getting leverage on a company outside the United States than in. In some ways, they are limited in the US, in other ways, outside the US. There are precedents to look back on, though. If I recall correctly (I hope I do) . . .when all the company names were leaked by Snowden, T-Mobile was not among them, because the particular type of leverage that they'd used didn't work against their parent company, Deutsche Telecom.

He's obviously wrong in that Bitcoin is working, but there is so much further to go . . . The comparison is noteworthy. Buying a soda at a gas station with a visa is pretty trivial, and many have no minimum transaction size.
We are sitting here celebrating $15 billion market cap, much of which is just being held, and our block size thing is still lingering...

When it's verified, that doesn't make it stop being conspiracy. That means it's not just a theory, though. Well if it was just one person then it's not a conspiracy, though (conspiracy requires multiple co-conspirators)

The biggest danger to bch is what will happen when core devs realize that they were wrong, that bch does have technical relevance, and implement the same change to steal that relevance. What bch has is time (starting back in August) that btc can never get back, having squandered it.

Yes, As opposed to things that aren't complicated, which people just sort of pick up as they go, with little trouble (like taxes, hacks, two years of fighting over the block size) along the way. I ignored most of your points because they were  fantasy arguments with things that no one ever said. I don't disrespect you or think that you're stupid. I just think it's funny that you refuse to acknowledge that it's complicated, and that this rat's nest of words is how you try to argue that it's not complicated. I believe that one day you'll look back and laugh at the fury you seem to be experiencing over this inconsequential tangent to a more interesting discussion. I never even said that being complicated was a bad thing.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:36:16
So how would that work? Are you proposing something like an escrow (neither party can spend it yet, but at least we know where it is . . . Unlike an escrow, there's probably no option to reverse it, other than a second voluntary opposite payment) or an IOU (I.e. the btc might already be gone when the date arrives)? I'm not sure how either one fits into the bitcoin paradigm.
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:11:49
You're too funny. The overwhelming majority of people (basically all the people in the world who aren't subscribed here) have no idea how to get Bitcoin or keep it secure from hackers. Because it's not complicated. Nevermind that all crypto has always been complicated, which is why it works.
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:26:23
So you're saying . . . It's complicated?

Well, it's not that general, but Blackberry is exceptional because they had a truly secure system, i.e. they were incapable of reading their users' emails. The remarkable thing you're overlooking here is that you did not *already have* way more access than a password grants. They could change their password or set a temporary one, and you'd be locked out again when you're done. Other services don't have that feature. I really regret that they haven't really stayed at the vanguard of the smartphone market, because google &amp; iphone surely don't do that.
I hope I'm not getting the details wrong - I am just thinking back to when Saudi Arabia asked for access to blackberry user's private data, and the answer was not "we won't" (much less "yes" like everyone else would answer) but "we can't".

"if the addresses are generated randomly"
This "failure to be random", and subsequent collision seems most likely to be caused by a faulty or badly seeded (pseudo-)random number generator. It's happened before. A while back, there was a linux bug in the news, where the possible # of keys generated for SSL certificates turned out to be way less than the correctly executed cryptographic process would have yielded:
To put it in perspective, a PRNG is a component of cryptography libraries that are used by more than just bitcoin users. This kind of failure is a big deal and has not happened many times, to my knowledge.
So from a pure math standpoint, the risk is negligible. But all it really takes is a bug, which is still pretty unlikely, but we don't have to describe that in astronomical terms. I am unaware of this ever having been a problem during bitcoin's history.
