A lot of people think hodling means not doing anything with your coins, when it really just means not exchanging them back into fiat.

We have to be careful with the terminology here. A coin is *always* stored in a wallet. 
The important difference is who holds the keys that provide access to the funds associated with that wallet. 
See, when you store your coins on what is called a 'hot wallet' (that's a wallet on an exchange for example) you are not actually in power over who gets to access these funds. Let's say the exchange gets hacked and the hacker gets access to the keys of "your" wallet (as has happened in the past), there is little you can do about it. 
When you set up your own wallet, on the other hand, you are responsible for the safety of your keys. Some people write their key phrases down on a piece of paper and put them in bank vaults, some keep them in their head, and others put them in a file on their computer. You're a smart cookie, so you probably realised that keeping them on your computer might not be the best idea. 
But trying to keep them in your head might also not be the best strategy. Here's the thing with this key phrase: once it's gone, it's **gone**. There is no "forgot password?" for your key phrase. 
Vice versa, anyone in possession of your key phrase is in possession of your coins. 
But why trust me, a stranger on the internet? I spend a few weeks doing my research on how to best keep my coins safe and secret from various people and institutions. It probably won't hurt if you take half an hour to do the same. 
Here are some topics that should make you more confident about your decisions:
• Hot wallet vs. cold wallet
• what's a paper wallet?
• what's the Ledger Nano S?
• bitcoin address and private key
• how does a seed phrase work?

Yes, given that the computer at home isn't infected. Ideally, you would use a device that  isn't (or has never been) connect to the internet to create your seed phrase. 
Alternatively you could use a device like the Ledger hardware wallets to create a seed. They have a small display on them where they display your seed. So it's less of a threat than having it displayed on your computer screen.

I myself am using the Electrum wallet to store Bitcoins since forever. It really depends on your needs tho. If you plan to hold multiple coins, you might want to look into something like the Jaxx wallet, which allows you to store various different coins in the same interface.

Yes. It's an extremely foolish act. The first thing you do before you invest is saying goodbye to your money. If you're not comfortable with doing that, don't invest. If you still do it, you have a gambling problem. If you have a gambling problem, i advice you to get some help before you end up like OP and potentially lose your life savings.
If you invest hoping that the value doubles tomorrow, but ignoring the fact that it could easily go the other way, you are delusional.

I don't think you can be too paranoid when it comes to this and I think it's irresponsible for anyone in these threads to tell someone else that their options are "safe enough". Please don't forget that you're talking to a bunch of strangers on the internet.
I hold coins. Coins that are potentially going to be worth millions one day. Why would I want to take any risks? 
If you plan on buying coins and not doing anything with them anytime soon, there are a whole bunch of crazy things you can do to keep them safe. 
Like creating a paper wallet and splitting the seed between two or more pieces of paper. Store these pieces in different locations. As you can see, we are entering aluminum-foil-helmet-levels of paranoia here.
You don't have to go all the way, but think about this: How easy is it for someone with malicious intent to spread spyware on a bunch of smartphones, hoping that one of them has a wallet installed. And how easy do you think it is for someone to break into their homes and look under their mattresses, hoping that one of them hides a paper wallet. 
Remember that paper burns, and so does a house sometimes. Create backups.

It gets bad when Coinbase starts freezing accounts for whatever reason and you can't access your coins anymore. It gets even worse when Coinbase gets hacked and you lose your coins because you are not in charge of the keys. 
I highly recommend doing at least the minimum amount of research before you start investing into anything. You can never go wrong with knowing what you're doing.

I feel like investing 2 more minutes in going the extra mile is most definitely worth it in this case – even if nothing is going to happen.
As for the second part of your comment: Do you understand what a seed phrase is and what it is used for? 
One of the main benefits of creating your seed on a device like the Ledger or any other device that may not have been directly compromised is that there is little chance anyone besides you will know about it. You'd obviously have to have some common sense and make sure you store your sensitive information in a safe place, but I'd argue that this method is so much more safer than creating your seed AND storing your coins on a device that can be so 'easily' compromised.

The problem, such as it has been discussed in the video, is that the seed phrase loses its value when it can be sniffed from your device using a key tracker or by taking a remote screenshot.
I really don't think that these kind of things are too far fetched actually.
It's similar to how you should be using a separate device to access your TANs for your online banking account.
But, as it is with most tech related things, you are free to chose the right balance of ease-of-use and security for you.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:04:23
Because you might as well just leave them on the exchange. I've added an interesting video to my original comment. It's a talk given by John McAfee about the security issues of modern smartphones that make them an unsafe place for your bitcoin wallet. 
I don't think people have fully realised yet what it means to be in full control of your assets. You can't compare a coin wallet to a bank account. The bank is trying its hardest to keep your assets safe. With a wallet it's up to YOU to make sure you keep it safe. And you need to keep it safe from the same people that the bank is trying to keep your assets safe. Do you see where I'm going with this?
When you've put a certain amount of money into coins, it might be a good idea to invest some more into a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S. 
If you think this investment isn't yet worth it for you, you should at least use a paper wallet with a seed phrase that has been generated on a device that isn't (or even better: has never been) connected to the internet. 
Now, if some of these terms are new to you, I highly recommend doing at least some research before you invest more money.

I don't even think it's about the way your keys are stored. It's about the way you enter your other credentials – or the way these credentials are displayed on your phone.
From what I've read, Android systems can be more easily infiltrated than an iOS system in this regard.
But there are other ways to get into your wallet. 
Here's an interesting story of a guy losing his coins after his Verizon 2FA got breached. 
I don't think I ever said you should use an average PC. If I did, I appologize. That would have been irresponsible.
In some of my other comments in this thread, I said to create your wallet and your seed phrase on a device that is not currently – or even better: has never been – connected to the internet. I also recommended looking into creating what is called a paper wallet or investing some money into a hardware wallet like the Ledger devices. 
I'm very concerned about this trend of people starting to invest in something they have no knowledge of. The same goes for the attitudes some other users in these threads have. No bank would ever think "I'm sure hackers are going to target some other low hanging fruit before they get to my assets". That's just irresponsible.
