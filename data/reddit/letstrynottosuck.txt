I'm really not sure, ethereum has had massive undeniable gains, but I don't really know why? It feels like a lot of it is floating on massive hype, but hype about what? Smart contracts are interesting, but ether just doesn't seem to have what bitcoin has (widespread mass appeal and adoption). I get that a lot of developers and coders are into ethereum, but I still don't understand why the average joe should care or ever use it?

What was satoshi's original vision for bitcoin when it reached this point? What was his idea to "fix" this issue?
@_date: 2017-05-31 03:11:43
eh, bitcoins relatively easy to explain, I just want the same for ethereum. I'm happy to get it, I just want to 'get it'
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:49:40
Okay, but TCP/IP protocols are relatively easy to explain and understand their use, I still don't really "get" ethereum?

If you've ever been to japan it isn't terribly surprising. They are very behind in terms of electronic banking, even worse than the USA, and they have a heavy reliance on cash and very old machines. Bitcoin could do really well there.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:44:13
Hmmm, then I'm back to where I was originally. Not understanding the disagreement.
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:31:58
By that logic no company anywhere should ever accept bitcoin, and yet plenty of them do.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:27:17
what's the reason core is against the compromise?
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:23:27


You're missing a critical point.
When we talk about regulation of things like environment, health care, etc. we're talking about society wide measures that can affect the public.
When we talk about things like drug taking, it's an individual choice in the end, and that's where people like to draw the line. When I make a choice for myself, I want ultimate power and responsibility.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:41:34
Hah, yeah I know I've been out of the game for a while. I just don't really get it.
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:33:19
That wouldn't be possible at this point. You couldn't roll back the tech to such an archaic and simplistic system. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:46:20
I don't understand being against big blocks. I've heard that "old pcs won't be able to run a node", but that's not really true at all. Any old pc can run a node, a 2TB HDD costs like $90.
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:26:54
You're talking about money laundering, but as we see today, it's pretty widespread and not really much of an issue to accomplish. It would happen, the black market would still exist.
This is all kind of moot though, to enact such an idea you'd need a time machine or a worldwide totalitarian regime.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:25:27
From what I've read the biggest issue is the problem of orphan blocks when the blocksize increases. But I don't fully understand why orphan blocks would increase if the blocksize increases. Would the miner simply need to distribute to enough nodes for the blocks to not be orphaned?
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:33:54
Has it ever been brought up to change the algorithm? To an ASIC resistant one?
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:57:22


Does increasing the blocksize really matter that much? I mean, I get that it's a bit annoying to dedicate space for the blockchain, but it's not terribly massive. Let's say it increases in the future, storage space costs also decrease in the future too.
Also, didn't satoshi acknowledge that the block size was limited artificially to stop DOS attacks?
(disclaimer:  I have no horse in this race, I don't care, I just want the system to work).
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:38:43
At what point is the blockchain size considered an issue?
We're already at 120GB. I wouldn't have an issue running a 1TB node, and storage is cheap. I just don't fully understand why that's such a sticking point?
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:52:09


"hey can I look through your phone?"
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:15:13
Huh? I do run a node. I recently re-downloaded the lot. It took about 36 hours. That was annoying but not a big deal.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:10:06
Hmmm, but this is what I don't understand. Running a node doesn't actually take that much HDD space. Increasing the block size wouldn't really have that much of an impact, surely? Especially as storage costs are constantly dropping? I just don't understand the logic. Let's say we double the blocksize and double the HDD space requirement for nodes. That's still only about 250GB.
I mean, okay, that's annoying. But it's not that massive, and it's not like it's going to get any smaller.
So, I guess I'm saying, if it got to 1TB next year, again, so what? 1TB HDD is like $50. Is that really a big worry for centralisation?
I want to understand, I just don't get it?
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:57:44
Wouldn't it make sense to try and get away from mining entirely. It'd be great if there was some kind of system that wasn't power intensive but that could be distributed so that everyone could participate. I know a algo change will never occur, but I feel like it would be the ideal solution.
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:19:41
These sound like good things, but I also would think that a hardfork is inevitable and necessary. I can see some justification in delaying a blocksize increase hardfork until the DDOS issue is dealt with, but then it seems like it should go ahead unobstructed?
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:29:51
I don't understand, are you saying segwit is effectively a zip file version of the same information? Or something else? How can it reduce block footprint while keeping the same information? (not moving that information somewhere else)?
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:59:15
Ah I see. I don't really see a downside to segwit then. Other than it's only a short term solution. Is that the general consensus? Segwit is acceptable but only short term?
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:42:37


The only thing that bugs me about that sentiment is that "the miners" went from you and me, to a few concentrated conglomerates.
I miss the days when the individual could participate.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:26:37
What are the fundamentals?
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:46:34
You don't understand his complaint.
The immoral part is the idea that the state co-erces you into a plea bargain. Take an example as illustration.
There's an innocent guy, but he's in a situation where he has no alibi and there's circumstantial evidence against him.
The state says, "take this plea, you'll get less, if you don't take it, we'll hold it against you and come down as hard as the law allows"
Guy says "but I'm actually innocent!"
State: "doesn't matter, take the plea and you'll only get 3 years, otherwise you're looking at 10"
That's the fucked and immoral part.
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:42:12
So if blocks are bigger, isn't that pretty much the same as increasing block size? 
I think I understand the difference to be that Segwit is pretty much the same as a 3MB block, but with segwit, you can run an old node and still have 1MB blocks (with the segwit data stripped). So you end up with an ecosystem of lightweight old PC nodes, and full segwit nodes.
Is that correct?
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:57:20
Really? Wow.
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:03:13
That's the difference between selectively applying the rules consistent with the spirit of the rules original intent, rather than blanket application ala "zero tolerance"
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:31:07
So I guess the road ahead should be segwit now, test hardfork, roll out hardfork if all works fine?
@_date: 2017-06-04 23:21:40


If you're concerned about the blockchain download through TOR, you're already too late. That's already not possible. The blockchain is cucrently 120GB. So it's not going to be downloaded by anyone on TOR.
Now, that said, if you're simply saying you want a bitcoin node to be able to be run on tails and through TOR, why wouldn't it be able to be run with a 1TB blockchain (assuming it's predownloaded)? From the point of view of TOR and TAILS there's no fundamental difference between a 120GB blockchain or a 1TB+ blockchain. There's no difference running 1MB blocks through TOR vs running 4MB blocks through TOR.
I'm still not understanding your objection, it doesn't seem to stand up to technical scrutiny.
Perhaps if you could answer this question:
* How would increasing the block size prevent old computers from running a node?
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:07:26










The market is irrational though. That's the biggest problem and one of my biggest annoyances. You can never predict it.
Right now, the market should be dropping, not rising, due to the dispute between miners and devs, but it's just totally ignored. The fee fiasco is ignored. The market is behaving irrationally.
This happens in all markets, and it's a PITA. You can have the best arguments in the world, but if the market behaves insane, you lose.
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:28:38
So isn't your problem essentially you're worried about the slippery slope of block size increases being perpetual, and forcing out the small players?
But to that I'd say - aren't you expecting storage to become cheaper and cheaper and internet speeds to increase further and further.
If you're worried about one cascade effect, why not consider the coinciding event of storage density increase?

Significant value is already in the crypto space. Even if the gov mandated that their own crypto be used. It wouldn't matter at this point. It wouldn't be worldwide, and transactions between nations would still need to be possible. Transactions between individuals would also be possible which would mean that people could transact gov coins for hidden unauthorised crypto coins.
So, let's just imagine a world where bitcoin was first invented by government and controlled as you say. Even in such a world, someone would create a hidden unauthorised crypto, and it would be transactable (even if it was on the black market).  It would be impossible to stop.

I still don't understand the hatred. I tried to research and understand both sides. I understand both points of view, and honestly I think both sides have good ideas. I don't really see much of a flaw in either. I still don't get the massive hatred and debate.
I lean slightly against the miners because I don't trust them, but that's just based on instinct. Technically I don't really get the complaint against their POV.
