Thank you for the clarification. I've been making sheeple jokes all day because I assumed the title was accurate and I can't be bothered to read statist propaganda. You hold true to your username

And your alternative is what? Lay down and accept slavery?
Statist arguments are just getting lazier.

This is an incredibly basic piece of typical statist bull, full of bold statist claims, with the typical statist lack of any kind of evidence. The dead horse they're trying to beat has been beaten down to the molecular level already. This is not worthy of discussion, and would be a tragic waste of an argument.
EDIT: After actually reading the thread itself, I can see that OP is an effortless troll who's managed to get himself a little attention, so we can all go home now.

This seems to sum up the attitudes toward government on You guys say things like this all the time, but if I were to say the Idea That Must Not Be Named, I would ride a waterfall of downvotes into the middle of the ocean.

But why stop and take a million when you can take ten million, or a billion?
There's no incentive for the leader of this ponzi scheme to ever pull the plug. I honestly see this as the core function of a ponzi scheme, without the corruption that tends to come with it.

Slap the word "genuine" on anything and it somehow deserves to make the front page! Yay reddit! Now for a reasonable counter to this insane post.


I use Bitcoin for retail every time I buy gas and it is instantaneous every single time. It takes about a tenth of the time that cash counting or the debit card dance would take. So this point is bullshit.


You're right, digital currency is way behind digital currency. But cash is way behind cash too! And credit cards have always been way behind credit cards.


I suppose you also don't believe in Darwin because natural selection is just so mean and *disgusting*. Look, the fact that tons of people decided to store their coins on some sketchy website in Japan only means there was a valuable lesson for the people who have clearly never thought through the dangers of centralization. History was made with MtGox, but Bitcoin survived, regardless of the stumbling that had to happen for it to truly be tested.


Not getting ripped off is as simple as **only spending money online where there is a good reputation** and **spending the rest of the money in person!** Look, if these basic rules of financial responsibility are too much for you, I'm sorry, because the rest of the adult population can use money well enough to adapt to this infinitely superior technology that will leave those siding with the banks, and you're gonna hate how *disgusting* this is, but fucked. You will be absolutely fucked one day when they pull the plug on their fake, ponzi economy.

Today I learned that everything is illegal as soon as it comes into existence, and things only become legal by the mercy of our glorious overlord, the state. I wish they would hurry up and legalize coffee. I just bought some at a store but I can't drink it until they give me permission.

The reason its in the sidebar is because bitcoin is inherently anti bank and anti government.
But this board is swarmed with statists who worship the IRS and other thugs.

What a great thread this could have been. But unfortunately, a large number of redditors agree that it is *unacceptable* to gather together and excitedly discuss something worthy of excited discussion.
Jaded people like that exist in all walks of life and generally receive the due cold shoulder, but only here on Reddit do those people **actually agree** with the people they rally their cynical peers to ridicule.
OP's post wasn't a God-tier post, but it was true and self-evident, without a shred of controversy or provocativeness. Yet Redditors chose to create controversy in OP's fairly innocent thread. **For posting something they agree with**.

Yes. They are the exact same thing. Anybody who makes money with Bitcoin and doesn't evade taxation is a coward, an idiot, evil, or any combination of the three.
It's as stupid as paying for files you could pirate, except instead of supporting artists, you're funding mass murder and the expansion of slavery, which could only be done by a chicken shit coward or an evil sadistic statist piece of shit.
So yes, Bitcoin and tax evasion are the same thing. If Bitcoin was meant to be taxed, it would come with a built-in automatic tax-deduction function.

Any currency that is not Bitcoin is slavery. Also, I had a good laugh about Russia "shutting down the internet".
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:20:20
It's because of bitcoin's inequality!

The Blockchain is a chain of blocks.    
A chain is a series of at least 3 things linked together at the ends.    
It can't be a chain without at least 3....

The Circlejerk Circlejerk logic is as follows:
1. Some phenomenon becomes immensely popular and well-discussed.    
2. Shockingly enough, people bring that behavior to reddit.    
3. Someone calls it a circlejerk.    
4. Remains blissfully unaware that he was the only one circlejerking.
