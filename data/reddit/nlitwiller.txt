Does running a full node have anything to do with confirmation times? Could I send a tx to the network with low fees and, since I'm running my own node, have it confirmed right away?
I like to think I know a lot about Bitcoin but I still haven't been able to wrap my head around the benefits of running my own node. People say that if you're not running your own node you aren't really using Bitcoin. I'm not sure I follow.

If you're only storing them off of an exchange temporarily until your Ledger comes in I'd just use a wallet on your phone. Paper wallets are nice and all, kind of fun to play around with but I'd go with a trusted hot wallet on your phone over a handwritten paper wallet. 1 typo and your money is gone.

Verified not ��
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:42:02
Thank you for your helpful response. That clears a lot up for me. I make it a habit to enter my destination address into blockchain.com every time I'm involved in a transaction and then watch the confirmations come in. Is there anything wrong with depending on blockchain.com to see when a transaction has been confirmed?
The other thing I don't get about a node is, in order to make sure my node verifies my transaction do I have to initiate the transaction from the node wallet? If I'm doing a transaction from my phone out in the wild, will having my own node make the verification any different than if I did it normally and relied on other random nodes?
I'm interested in setting up a node bc I like to tinker but I'm too dumb to actually set one up and I don't want to shell out $300 to get a Kasa Node.

When the lightning torch was going around didn't they send it to the ISS?

I asked my wife what she thought about it bc I was genuinely curious to hear her opinion. She was just like, "It's your thing, and your money. I hope it turns out like you think it will but I honestly don't care about it." She's happy for me when the price goes up and I think she has a basic understanding of the subject, I'm just glad she doesn't hate it and hate me for it. She still leaves the room when I'm watching The Modern Investor's videos on YouTube.

Sort of. I have multiple bitcoin wallets but only 1 cell phone. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:22:01
So what do I do if I've already put a bunch of coins on there? Just forget about this post and hope for the best? I only have ETH, XRP and LTC on there now but I don't really want to eat more fees taking all the coins off and putting them back on again. Then again those fees are a pittance compared to being confident they're all on there only to find there's nothing left when I go to cash out. Any other ideas?

Because it could be on its way down from the highest it'll ever be ever for the rest of the time that bitcoin is a thing.

You're right, originally that symbol had a wonderful meaning, and it still does for some people but you'd have to be out of your God damned mind to suggest that we adopt a symbol that nearly everyone associates with Nazis to denote bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 17:35:45
Yes but we're working with a blank slate here, we can make the symbol anything we want. Why start off with something with such a sketchy history? I bet you wouldn't say the same thing if someone suggested we use a swastika as the bitcoin symbol.

They're paying too much in CC processing fees. Lightning fees are way lower. If they can get people to start using the lightning network to pay for groceries then that's more money in their pockets.

Locked my hardware wallet's passphrase away onto some steel plates behind an old fashioned multi-sig barrier this weekend. Having that extra layer of security there that will guard against fire, flood, EMPs etc gives me a lot of peace of mind that my funds are safu.  
Edit: misspellt peace.
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:22:48
Passphrase is the set of words that your hardware wallet automatically generates for backup. Most are 12-24 words.

walletgenerator.net claims their code is 99% the same as bitaddress.org. The reason I chose walletgenerator.net is purely for aesthetic reasons, their paper wallets just look nicer.

From a historical perspective Bitcoin Billionaires is a pretty great story that follows the Winklevoss twins.

I think you're right. The "client" she's in contact with isn't a super rich individual, they're an agent of a government. I don't think they'll ever be able to purchase such a stack but if they could that seems like a sure way to kill bitcoin. This story has been getting a lot of press in the past week, most people seem to think it'll have a positive impact on the space. I find it more troubling than anything.

I've been saving all of my change for like 10 years and I just cashed it in. Over $500. I sent it to Coinbase on Tuesday but thankfully it hasn't shown up yet. I would have missed out on this dip.

I put my buy order in on gdax for $6725. I feel like I'm yelling at my cats when they jump up on the counter as it's hovering around $6738. BITCOIN GET DOWN!!
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:30:20
It'll go back up. I have no plans on selling for several years (at least until 2024). By that point I expect the price will be higher than what I bought in for. I don't really watch the price unless I'm buying and then I want the price to be low so I can add more coins to my bags.

I wonder if he saw that we were nearing the top of a bubble and threw $100 in so he could watch it go down in value and prove himself right that crypto is crap.
