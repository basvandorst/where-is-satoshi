I get that this sounds counter-intuitive. Let's play this out over the past two years with real data.
Jan 1,2017: 1 BTC = 960USD
Today June 22, 2019: 1 BTC = 10800USD
If your life savings is 100k, the maximum return you can get is 1025% if you invest 100%. If you're actually suggesting that someone in this situation should put 100% of their life savings in bitcoin, I imagine you are either young and have never had 100k or you've lost a lot of money as investor and haven't learned anything. However, for 99.99% of people can't afford the risk of putting all they have in bitcoin, let's say you decide to set aside 15k for emergencies, every cash flow, and more stable investments. This is a fairly aggressive investment mix towards BTC.
**Without Rebalancing**
*A buy and HODL strategy says you invest the remaining 85K and don't touch it.* You buy 88.54 BTC for 85k on Jan 1,2017. Today this is worth $956,250 for a **total return of 856.25% on your 100k of investable assets.**
**Now with Rebalancing**
To simplify this to the simplest form of rebalancing let's say you rebalance every six months (rather than using a threshold rebalance).
*Your rebalancing dates are:*
* June 30, 2017: 1 BTC = 2500 
* Dec 31, 2017: 1 BTC = 14500
* Jun 30, 2018: 1 BTC = 5900
* Dec 31, 2018: 1 BTC = 3800
Investing 100k at a 85/15 BTC/cash rebalancing allocation, you also buy 88.54 BTC for 85k on Jan 1,2017.
On **June 30, 2017 your portfolio is $236,354** ($221,354 BTC + $15,000 cash). You sell 8.18 BTC to bring your portfolio back to 85% BTC. You now have 80.36 BTC = $200,901 and you have $35,453 cash
On **December 31, 2017 your portfolio is $1,200,679** ($1,165,226 BTC + $35,453 cash). You sell 9.98 BTC to bring your portfolio back to 85% BTC. You now have 70.38 BTC = $1,020,577 and you have $180,102 cash
On **June 30, 2018 your portfolio is $595,371** ($415,269 BTC + $180,102 cash). You buy 15.39 BTC to bring your portfolio back to 85% BTC. You now have 85.77 BTC = $506,066 and you have $89,306 cash
On **December 30, 2017 your portfolio is $415,246** ($325,941 BTC + $89,306 cash). You buy 7.11 BTC to bring your portfolio back to 85% BTC. You now have 92.88 BTC = $352,959 and you have $62,287 cash
**Today your portfolio is $1,065,434** ($1,003,147 BTC + $62,287 cash).
Your total return on 100k with rebalancing is 965.43% as opposed 856.25% without, netting you $109,184 more than a no rebalancing strategy over the past two years. This difference is even greater more when you rebalance using the threshold system described in the original post as opposed to only twice per year.
Again, you have to be conscious of transactions fees you pay to trade. 
Happy to send you the google sheet I whipped up to model this.

I disagree. Downvote says that the value of the post is low. I disagree with the post but think this is a quality conversion to have. Hence my up vote.

Comparing bitcoin to stocks isn’t an apples to apples comparison. Stocks represent ownership in a company that is purpose to create new value. Bitcoin should be compared to gold as simply a store of value. 
Your argument has merit, but the problem is not that
Bitcoin’s price is driven by supply and demand. All prices are driven by supply and demand. 
Your right that BTC price can be manipulated. The reason is because the market cap is small enough (in comparison to things like gold) that a billionaire or even millionaire could effect the prices in the short term. The key word here is in the short term. 
I don’t agree that the price movement we’re seeing is purely being driven by manipulation. There a a number of political and economical events that are happening right now that are pushing governments, institutions, and the public to divest from fiat currencies. Governments are devaluing their currencies, global trade is reducing, more and more governments and institutions are investing in blockchain technologies, bitcoin infrastructure is increasing and adoption is growing, and more people have access to the BTC market. 
So in short I think the intrinsic value Bitcoin is in deed growing against fiat for the reasons above, but the price over any given short term stretch will be volatile as the market tries to put a dollar value to BTC, whales try to manipulate, and investors experience FOMO and FUD. Volatility will reduce as the market cap increases from billions to trillions.

I don’t disagree with you. But the reason investors (new and old) don’t outperform the market is because of poor behaviour. Given that this post is advice on controlling behaviour, taking this approach is one of the only ways I see any new investor doing better than market. 
If you don’t trust yourself the next best thing you can do is HODL. Buy in and then forget your password, delete the app, and set a reminder with instructions to cash in 5-10 years later. Good luck

It depends on your risk appetite and current circumstances. You pay 6% interest but bitcoin has had an annualized return of something like 138% per year so far. In the long term its not a bad plan to hold onto to debt while you invest in bitcoin. 
The risk comes through bitcoin’s volatility. While you may realize a huge return in the long run, we know bitcoin could lose all of its value at once and not recover for periods of months or years. 
Think of risk as the chance of permanent loss of capital. You only lose if you sell when you are down. So some key questions are:
Do you have enough income to service your debt payments comfortably without touching your investment? 
Do you you work a stable job?
Do you see yourself needing capital for another expense in the short to mid term?
Do you have any other sources of capital to use in case of an emergency?
Do you trust yourself to hold on if things get rough?
The visionary in me says you should HODL everything you have. However, a smart passive investment strategy says you should determine a risk level and stick to. 
Passive Strategy + Rebalancing 
Pick a percentage of your investable assets that you will always aim to have in bitcoin. 
If you say 70/30. You should sell until 30% of what you have to invest is out of the market and then rebalance you portfolio over time. Rebalancing means as bitcoin goes up, the percentage of your portfolio in bitcoin will rise and then you rebalance to capitalize by selling a portion at the higher price, bringing your allocation back to 70/30. If bitcoin goes down, you buy to bring you back to 70/30 (Buying in at a lower price). This strategy takes the emotions out of your trading, will pay your debt down naturally over time, while making sure you're always invested. The key is you need to make sure you have money to cover your living expenses and debt payments. If you don’t you should sell now to de-risk yourself.

I thought [this](  was a pretty good guide for beginners. Check out the bit on researching different exchanges.

Everything you said is true, transactions fees and tax can easily  eat away at the befits of rebalancing depending on your situation. Rebalancing only at larger thresholds or on a bi-annual basis reduces the impact of transaction fees (especially is your investing larger amounts). 
You’re right that if BTC is worth more in the future. 100% BTC will maximize your return. When I say outperform BTC, this is in reference to your return on invested capital. In other words, investing 70% and rebalancing will beat investing 70% and HODLing. 
Besides the higher return, rebalancing is worth considering for the reduction in volatility it brings to your portfolio. I don’t think anyone should have 100% of their money in BTC. If you do I’d strongly urge that the risk you’re taking is not worth the differential return by keeping a small percentage in more stable assets.  If you’re part of the 99.99% of people that don’t put every cent they have in BTC, you will now be faced with the choice of redirecting more of your reserve (or other investments) to BTC based on what you see in the markets. For these people who want to capitalize on fluctuations, rebalancing is a tried a true way to do this without emotion to make a higher return.

I’m doing this manually for now. All I do is calculate threshold prices. I know my portfolio needs to rebalance when bitcoin drops to X price or increases to X price. When it hits the threshold I rebalance and calculate the new threshold price. Setting a large enough threshold means I only rebalance a few times per year. I don’t recommended setting a threshold differential that calls for rebalancing too often or you’ll suffer from transaction fees. 
You could also just rebalance ever 6 months instead of using thresholds, but this won’t get you as high of a return.

Perhaps the wording of my post was a bit misleading. When I say out perform BTC, I mean your invested capital (70%) will return higher if you rebalance rather than invest 70% of what you have and HODL without rebalancing.
In reality, very few people put 100% of what they have in Bitcoin. So for most people if you in invest 100k which happens to 70% of what you have you’re better off to rebalance than to leave what you have without rebalancing. 
I’ve included a simulated model of how this works [here](
