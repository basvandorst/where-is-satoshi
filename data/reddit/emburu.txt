Thank you. Anyone denying it is either stupid or delusional ;)
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:14:51
People keep donating to his alleged address. If you google you can find it. Worth $billions. Never moved any of it. He's bound to be the world first trillionaire.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:34:05
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:01:17
Nope. Bitcoin isn't recommended for small transactions (less then $300) right now. Wait for fees to go down or use Litecoin.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:42:56
All hail Andreas!
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:57:14
Hodl on tight. This is a rollercoaster!
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:41:26
Heheh ok 
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:54:20
Still at  though :(
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:18:15
I fixed it. I'm using Litecoin for transacting for now. 1 penny/ ttansaction fee. One fucking penny. Top that Bitshit! 
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:00:23
Is the audio sped up? So dman fast. Can't understand shit. Fuck this.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:06:18
I stand corrected. Good to know.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:14:59
Use Gdax. Its free. Transfer from coinbase to gdax is also free.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:49:55
Stay away from btc transactions for now. Unless it's a big amount ( +$500 )
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:34:56
You bet your butt I do 
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:01:37
Don't worry. The transaction will either eventually go through or the network will forget about it and drops it, in that case you get the coin back. Cancel in Mycelium is pointless. Once the network knows about the transaction, you can't cancel it. Just wait. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:42:06
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:28:47
A currency you can't transact with at the moment BTW. BECAUSE THE FEES ARE SO DAMN HIGH. FIX THE SHIT ALREADY!
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:43:25
We're in the same boat, my friend. There's nothing you could do. Just wait for it to go through or for the network to forget about it and drops it. There are currently about ~200000 unconfirmed transactions. So, good luck! 
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:28:26
Fuck Ver and his trash coin!
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:02:31
This isn't the first time Electrum has had security issues. They need to get their shit together or abandon the project. A strong case for hardware or paper wallets.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:51:45
I don't know. I've been avoiding bitcoin transactiona until this issue is fixed. There are ~200000 unconfirmed transactions right now on the network. If you want to play around with crypto. I suggest Litecoin. Fast and transaction fees are very low. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:01:40
Nope. Only USD. I'm 100% sure FDIC doesn't insure your crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:45:19
Andreas is a millionaire now. He doesn't need my $1 dollar :) . I'd rather give it to someone new to the currency.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:31:40
Yw 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:04:32
Thanks. Didn't know that. Ima try it now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:53:19
Hankock really? The guy who wrote "the Mars mystery" ? An advanced civilization living on Mars. Really? This is your guy? He's a fraud. Writing for money. No scientific background at all. But he's your guy?  
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:40:40
How about the bitcoin cash wallet? what should I do with it?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:25:53
Exactly. Remember btc back in 2012, 2013..etc? Fees almost nonexistent
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:09:05
How to send all btc including fee so the balance of the wallet is 0?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:39:59
Yes. Today.  He was talking about bitcoin for a bit. And said Andreas is coming back. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:50
The jump from 100th of a penny to $13000 is bigger than $13k to 1mill. It's possible.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:28:48
I did it. You're a life saver! Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:47:29
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:15:37
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:24:39
Google for bitcoin Atm near you and just buy with cash 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:49:41
Congrats. Get that thing off Windows though. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:31:47
He spent all money on cock and hookers. Thanks a lot bitcoin community. �� jk
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:13
Our community is awesome! And Andreas totally deserves all the love. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:22:11
Easiest way is to check if there's an bitcoin ATM near you. If not, just use one of the online exchanges 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:06:26
I know. I was watching :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:48:55
I've done it before. It takes hours of course.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:26
One million US dollars... Will wait!
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:57:39
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:44:21
Yes. But bitcoin cash is diferent than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:37:17
He is 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:29:18
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:49:28
Gamble away! ;)
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:23:07
Volatility, my friend. Volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:05:42
Ran into similar problem too.  Open an account with simple.com . transfer money from your credit union to Simple. Use Simple account to buy on Gdax. Simple does not charge any fees of any kind. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:07:20
Biggest fuck you ever given!  
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:32:37
Post your public address. And I will donate $1 to you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:37:36
In Mycelium, you can adjust the feezs. Transaction will take longer to confirm though
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:37:35
please considering donating to [Fight for the forgotten]( . This dude builds water wells in remote Congo villages in Africa. Legit. Please read his story. He's been on [Joe Rogan](  podcast many times  
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:28:52
Anything for Andreas. I got into bitcoin after hearing him the first time on Joe Rogan podcast. Never knew anything about it prior to that. Thank you, Andreas! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:13:23
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:54:45
Me too
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:28:37
Well, must be a bug then. Congrats on the extra money. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:16:16
Still impressive though. All donations. Rogan is donating all the money to charity. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:26:57
Do not keep your coins on coinbase or any other exchange for that matter. Always transfer to a wallet to which you control the keys. I suggest Mycelium. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:50:46
Yes he still does. Still on his phone. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:36:28
It will cost me 7cents 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:50:11
Too late now :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:55:19
Awesome! Thank you so much! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:21:08
I'm having trouble signing up to Patreon. Did you guys crash the site?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:19:05
yw 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:25:11
Of course they r ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:52:22
Remember when  Andreas set up a bitcoin wallet for Rogan the first time he was on? Check the balance on it now: 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:26:27
No. Not safe. [Antonopolous](     
What if the gov shuts down coinbase tomorrow? Good bye btc. Only use exchanges to buy/ sell and immediately transfer balance to a wallet you CONTROL. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:48:30
Most likely it was an online wallet. blockchain.info was the wallet and Andreas was working for them at the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:02:01
Most likely an exchange address 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:57:51
lol ok 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:20:48
I believe so. All 5.2 btc of them. All donations btw from btc community.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:43:01
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:53:49
what a fucking narcissist! Go fuck yourself, Roger!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:04:58
On blockchain.info wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:32:59
Praise Odin!
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:59:52
I doubt it. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:16:33
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:03:30
More like 10cents/ hour. Forget it man,  not worth your  time
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:00:23
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:48:58
Hodl then and stop beating the dead horse. We know there is a problem. Yesterday ~300k unconfirmed transactions. Today ~190k . Fees are coming down and transactions r being conformed faster. Hodl!
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:04:34
Yes you can
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:47:39
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:02:03

@_date: 2017-12-11 19:03:50
Yup :)

@_date: 2017-12-23 00:34:43
Bitcoin cash. Coinbase just started bcash trading. If you held bitcoin prior to the fork in August you automatically get the same ammount in bitcoin cash. It's just another coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:31:51
We all in the same boat hehehe . $300 investment in 2013 = $1000000+ right now. Oh well... Live and learn 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:54:12
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:05:35


sent .. it'll take a while though. low fee ;)
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:57:51
When a white cat meows at dawn, price goes up. And when a black cats meows at dawn, price goes down. Magic!
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:33:10
I also got my first introduction to bitcoin on Joe Rogan podcast 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:33:34
Go away bitchCash cuck troll
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:32:46
~5.3 bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:22:19
Still taking longer than I expected. 0 confirmations so far :( 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:53:59
He did. Remember the whole Dorian Nakamoto fiasco? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:10:33

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:13:31
What are you talking about? Only 5 bitcoin on that address ~ $65k 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:26:12
Everyone just fucking hodl. Lightning network is coming. Also fees are starting to go down. Patience!
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:57:02
Hmm... Are you Sure you didnt buy $100 worth of each? Cause they're totally different coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:11:20
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:06:38
Google if there is a bitcoin ATM near you. Easiest way to buy BTC imo. Scan your wallet,  insert cash, press 'done'. Boom!
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:04:43
Faucets are a waste of time and energy. Work, invest. There are no shortcuts, my friend. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:09:29
$700 in January to $10,000 in November.. I can't do the math, but that's a lot in less than a year.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:14:03
Find Bitcoin ATM 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:28:07
Hi, dog
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:10:35
Thanks. Still waiting ..
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:06:20
Watch 10 ads to earn 1 penny? Is your time worth that much? I don't think so. Forget about faucets!
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:26:18
I paid 7 cents fee on a transaction once and it took ~20 hours to confirm.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:21:28
Just wait. It takes time when the fee is low. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:19:21
The question is who isn't?
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:08:05
I hope you're wrong
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:41:50
I'm all in. Either become a millionaire off of this or have a good ass story of why I'm broke. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:36:14
James is ballin' outta control right now ��
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:24:28
Not shit posting at all. I am just genuinely concerned 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:20:29
GDAX or Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:20:41
No. Confirmed. Refresh and wait. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:35:14
Having the same problem. It's been over 12 hours. Solution?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:23:15
If the fee is too low, it will take a long time to confirm. In my case I paid 7cents for $30 transaction. Ended up taking about 15 hours to confirm. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:36:13
You don't own the keys, you dont own the bitcoin. Exchanges should only be used for buying\selling not storing.
