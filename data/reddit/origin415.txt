You don't see anyone talking about that.

No, because this guy was specifically doing it for buyers of drugs and advertised it on silk road. The article doesn't really discuss the history of the case.

It is, the early bettors get more of the losers bet than the later bettors. The house gets 1% of all bets always, all the rest is distributed to some bettor.

Here is the first episode of the modern version: 
Seems not much different.
I couldn't find any gameplay from the very first episode, but here is audio from 1968: 
Seems not much different than the modern format either.

Taxed like foreign currency, read about that here: 
Anytime you make money, it's income tax unless specifically exempted or reclassified. I have no idea where this sub got the idea that they'd be able to make money from bitcoin and not pay taxes.

You only pay taxes when you sell.

I signed up for a local credit union completely online in 2012ish. Still never been to a branch.

It's not necessarily about counting leading zeroes. A hash is just a number, it can be written as a series of letters but in can be interpreted as just a number. Then the difficulty is set by asking that number to be less than some fixed difficulty number.
As a simple example, say the hashes are all less than 1000, then we can ask for the hash to be less than say 90. When you mine you keep trying to hash different things, which might be like 0172, 0834, 0092, and then finally you hit 0074 and you get your block. So the leading zeroes matter, but they aren't actually what you are using to determine difficulty. This gives complete control over the

That does not have the "mandatory" column filled in, which is bigger than the discretionary and includes social security, medicare, and medicaid. Go to the 2013 version and it has a complete table.

That's only true if you assume there is enough money to actually buy all the coins. If everyone agrees a coin is worth $1 billion, then it is worth that, it doesn't matter how much USD there is.

You still have to pay taxes on any BTC you spend, it is the same thing as if you had sold it at an exchange yourself.

Mining pools remove the need to have a full node. So no.

There are two parts to a bank's business: deposits and loans. Neither are fully replaced by bitcoin.
For deposits, a stable bitcoin may replicate a checking account, but bitcoin does not offer any interest on savings, or CDs or other investment products. It also has added safety: if my house burns down and I lose all my possessions, I might lose access to the wallet I kept on my computer but I could get new ids and get access to my bank account again, nothing lost.
For loans, the decentralized, pseudonymous nature makes bitcoin a bad way to hold people accountable for debt.
Either of these voids could be filled by a bitcoin business offering those services, but then you'd just have banks again.

Cash is already far more anonymous.

Blocks will keep being generated, just no rewards. The difficulty will drop automatically if the hashrate drops, so confirmation times will be similar.

Bank tellers are already a little antiquated. One of the local credit unions around here has no tellers, branches just consist of ATMs and a couple of folks to help you sign up (but not to withdraw anything).
Accountants don't typically deal with physical cash anyway, their job is just as important.

At this point the only way to make money is dedicated hardware and low cost energy. Your graphics card is pretty good at hashing things, but it isn't made for that. Mining farms have specialized chips called ASICs which were built from the ground up to hash things as quickly and efficiently as possible, and because there are so many of these, your graphics card is useless in comparison. Don't feel too bad, because these ASICs are borderline useless too, they have to be used in areas with cheap power or else they'll cost more to run than they produce.

Having bitcoin subject to capital gains tax is the best case scenario from a taxpayer prospective. Taxing it like money would benefit the government much more.

Transactions are passed around the network so that miners can find them and include them in their blocks.
A miner will see one of your transactions, include it, then when the other comes by it'll ignore it. Different miners may see different transactions first, and thus try to make a block with a different one first, so it'll be impossible to predict which one is actually chosen for the next block. Once one is included the miners which had the other will discard it, and the transaction will disappear.
Blockchain.info monitors the transactions floating around the network and looks for two conflicting transactions like this. Instead of discarding one of them like a miner, they post them on that page. The transactions are not in any block while they are conflicting.

Yep, that's it.

It doesn't matter if you spend them or sell them, you still pay gains when you do. It is taxed as a commodity just like stocks are. If you don't use them, you don't pay taxes, it is just unrealized capital gains.

The hash is just a number: hex is short for hexadecimal, it's just an alternative way to write numbers more compactly by having more options for each digit, 16 instead of 10. Then the criteria for the new block is that this number is less than a certain number given by the difficulty.
