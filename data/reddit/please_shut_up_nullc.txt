And the fact that your comment karma is [exactly 666]( speaks volumes about you, oh right no it doesn't this is just a fucking website.

Please don't use CoinBase. They close people's accounts all the time and allegedly "can't" say anything about it or return the funds. SRSLY, don't buy on Coinbase.

Dude, if TXs don't scale and people stop using bitcoin in 1 year your node will be totally worthless. I hope you are being snarky but if not, god help us all in Bitcoin land.

Coinbase sucks, figure out how not to use them ASAP.

u/Shaaler, I am a hobby mineer and can answer a few of your questions.
1. No, there is no "Maximum Difficulty", that would not make any sense. 
2. Yes, it is easy to Google that exact phrase you typed into the Reddit commit box, "list of bitcoin pools with all fees". (Next time try the Google option first maybe?)
3. No. No no no. Just no. 
4. Ok, maybe. If you have free electricity and are assembling your 400 - 1400 Antminers your self, then yes, maybe you could make money in 3 years. Otherwise, pretty much any cost about $0 per KW you will end up spending more than you make. This dose not account for equipment cost, maintenance, skill development. 
If I seem snarky its because I assume you are just trolling with your questions, anyone with $1 million could not be so dumb. 
Good luck!

Nullc, I hope one day we find out what your true motives have been throughout this whole ordeal. What really was behind your insistence for so long that Bitcoin should not grow. Why and how can you seem to not see what is going on right now, that Bitcoin is trying to expand but can't. You have a massive influence in this area and could easily officially switch BS to running Unlimited. I am amazed in the face of so much pressure you continue to not budge to even entertain the fact there may be a resonable way to scale on chain.
