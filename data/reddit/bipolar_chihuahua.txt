I said people *treat* bitcoin as an investment although it is supposed to be a currency. I view bitcoin as the same kind of investment as beanie babies. A stuffed animal won't pay you dividends or generate revenue either. It has about the same value as bitcoin since no business will accept either as currency.

Bitcoin has been around for what 9 years or so? You got 1 business to use it? Whooptie fuckin do.

What's the % of businesses that accept it? It has to be less than 1%. It's probably less than .1%. Thats virtually none. I didn't lie.

Gold and Oil are raw materials used to make end products. I don't think it's possible to use bitcoins to make something.

Except virtually no businesses accept it as currency and no employers pay in bitcoin so calling it money is a stretch. Almost everyone treats it as an investment that pays no dividends or generates any revenue. They just hope some schmuck will pay more than they did for it.    
Edit: Thank you for my first gold kind sir/miss!

I make an investment in the stock of a business. The business generates revenue and pays me a dividend.  
  
None of the above applies to Bitcoin. Please continue fooling yourself.

You are correct people trade in currencies but the main function of a currency is not as an investment. The main function of bitcoin seems to be as an investment.
