I’d just like to express that I’ve never been a moody person but this last month has challenged that.

I was literally just thinking this 20 minutes ago.

This is what Coinbase suggested. I think my Chrome time zone is wrong so I’m switching browsers since I can’t figure out the correct time zone based on Chrome’s time zone options. Ik my time zone but Chrome has gone off the deep end with time zone inclusiveness. I don’t see why they can’t just auto select my time zone based on my location which they have pinged anyways, Shit, Any suggestions for a better browser? All I use now is Chrome and Safari.

I wonder if they’re trying to stabilize Bitcoin’s value at $10k to align it with the US dollar. Doesn’t make since I know but I can see it happening. The old generation just needs to fuck off and pass the baton. The old way wasn’t working so it’s on us to do what we gotta do to survive.

I added Authenticator as a 2-step verification for Coinbase but the codes the send never work... so I can’t sign in until I’m able to enter a correct code.

Now I understand how my ex’s felt.
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:30:02
Right. Well my iPhone Coinbase app has kept me signed in luckily for now. The problem is my MacBook won’t accept the code generated to my iPhone’s Authenticator app.
Maybe that’ll offer some insight.

I just had a vision that one morning I’ll wake up, check the chart, and Bitcoin will be 56m and counting, 10’s of millions by the day.

The cashier or sales rep has no say in whether or not that company adopts $B payments. They’re also not an avenue for potential adoption, The decision makers know about $B and have thought about it. Their mind will more likely be changed by seeing other companies accept $B than some “lazy entitled millennial” mentioning it. It’s actually counter productive. $B is no secret and it’s only a matter of time before all successful corporations accept it. We are
very early though, which is incredibly opportunistic for early adopters like you and me. 
That said you’re not annoying. You’re cute and sweet and tall.

Bitcoin is below 10k for the last time.
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:06:38
The day before last
Someone said bitcoin is its own entity.
There’s no predicting it.

Why fees are when they are fucked? Buy 1 BTC. Price goes sky $1,000. This luck is having one, right? So, I to sell but now... problem. Profit total: $180. Not right bc of the fuck. What is it? Tell me.
How do I making profit and no fee? Who made this? Give me 3 name.

This isn’t going to happen. If the world adopts bitcoin as its currency, sure, but that hasn’t happened and these last two massive pumps have been whales pumping and dumping. Best to get out before the big next big dump. It would be different if the price actually went up, but the green candles turn into red candles the same day and I won’t let you tell me that’s anything other than market manipulation. 
The whales aren’t trying to adopt bitcoin. They don’t want to use bitcoin as currency. They want to trade it. They want you to buy it high so they can rip you off. They saw an opportunity and they took it. If you buy for Bitcoin, hold it and use it. If you want to trade, wait for the next crash bc this phase is over. I could be wrong but what I do know is that there won’t be some huge breakout. This is a psychological game and the 2 big pumps have just been whales trying to make a buck. If it weren’t, it wouldn’t pump and dump. It would just pump, without any dump, That whole $100m or better yet, $100t bullshit is unfortunate standard Ponzi hopium no better than a pyramid scheme and most of us learn the hard way otherwise they wouldn’t be doing it, 
Don’t be a fool! Long term bullish maybe, but these rallies have been artificial. Don’t believe me though, just thought I’d warn ya.

Same. Put in 4K. Feels bad, man. All those “$20k here we come!” posts gave me FOMO. I sold 500 at 12.5 just to save my ass if it kept dropping. It did.

Bitcoin is so unpredictable, there’s no way of knowing but because it is so unpredictable, there’s an immense probability that it will spike like crazy at least once more and you’ll be wise to invest now if you can be patient. It has a way of spiking when it seems least likely.

Litecoin Cash goes from $.01 to over $.02 many times a week. Does this mean I could double my investment each time it does this? 
I wouldn’t even be asking if I could find a legit way to buy the shit.
