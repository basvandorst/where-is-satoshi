wow thanks so much! Fun and crazy was my goal, I wanted to completely avoid painting cryptocurrencies in an ominous and serious light.

When I read gapmunky's entry post I first understood it as claiming to be an original piece. It's why_bitcoin_is_cool's contest and rules, so a Photoshop edit could be fair game, but it was disappointing that the fact it was an edit wasn't made clear in the entry and the original art wasn't referenced/credited.

Thanks so much! Been wanting to get my first bitcoin and this contest has been an awesome way to do so!

I'm going to edit together a time-lapse video of the drawing sometime in the next week or so. Also, I plan on making this image available soon under a creative commons license. It will be part of a bigger collection of free art when I launch BackgroundArt.net early this year.
