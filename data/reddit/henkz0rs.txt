Like [E-stonia]( is doing, pretty neat solution:
e-Residents receive a smart ID card which provides:
-digital identification and authentication to secure services
-digital signing of documents
-digital verification of document authenticity
-document encryption
Digital signatures and authentication are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures and face-to-face identification in Estonia and between partners upon agreement anywhere around the world. The e-Resident ID card and services are built on state-of-the-art technological solutions, including 2048-bit public key encryption. The smart ID card contains a microchip with two security certificates: one for authentication, called PIN1, and another for digital signing, called PIN2. PIN1 is a minimum 4-digit number for authorization, PIN2 is a minimum 5-digit number for digital signature.

"BackToConstitution 8 months ago
 Update: On Wednesday, May 6, 2015 at about 10:17 pm, I finally got over the trauma and opened the bitcoin wallet.  In about an hour, I checked and the bitcoins that were lost were recovered.  There was no theft!  The bitcoin wallet will sometimes tell you that you have no coins, when actually, you do and that's what happened to me and perhaps many others.  I changed the settings on Microsoft Security Essentials to 'Run as Administrator' and it blocked the bitcoin wallet from confirming the bitcoins.  This caused the readout to say, '0000 bitcoins' and also '131 bitcoins unconfirmed'.  I feel a duty to announce it here in the comments section as well as in the video description, because it is a lesson for all who want to know how bitcoin and the wallets work.  I can't speak about all wallets, because I have tried only one and it's the bitcoin client wallet.  Few have experience with it and also with the MSE firewall and so I'm publishing my experience for all to learn"

You can calculate the market cap by yourself pretty easy. You only need to know the current price and the amount of bitcoin currently mined.
What is "Market Capitalization" and how is it calculated? 
Market Capitalization is one way to rank the relative size of a cryptocurrency. It's calculated by multiplying the Price by the Circulating Supply. 
Market Cap = Price X Circulating Supply.
Best page to check the price is  search for btcusd, btceur btc*yourcurrency*

On the main page there is a tool to check your node:
"JOIN THE NETWORK
Be part of the Bitcoin network by running a Bitcoin full node, e.g. Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin Core.
 CHECK NODE
Use this tool to check if your Bitcoin client is currently accepting incoming connections from other nodes."
It happend to me that my node wasnt listed, but after a few node checks the site added my node to the list.

./configure - PARAMETERS
Make -j2
Sudo make install
Bitcoind &amp; = start the client
Bitcoin-cli getinfo = test if node is running.

Did he even care to google "WS.Reputation.1"?
WS.Reputation.1 is a detection for files that have a low reputation score based on analyzing data from Symantec’s community of users and therefore are likely to be security risks. Detections of this type are based on Symantec’s reputation-based security technology. Because this detection is based on a reputation score, it does not represent a specific class of threat like adware or spyware, but instead applies to all threat categories. 
The reputation-based system uses "the wisdom of crowds" (Symantec’s tens of millions of end users) connected to cloud-based intelligence to compute a reputation score for an application, and in the process identify malicious software in an entirely new way beyond traditional signatures and behavior-based detection techniques.

"Any computer that connects to the Bitcoin network is called a node. Nodes that fully enforce all of the rules of Bitcoin are called full nodes." 
Tho the node only saves the last part of the blockchain, it IS fully enforcing all the rules of the bitcoin protocol.  You might want to look into "pruning" a node, or check out this manual:
