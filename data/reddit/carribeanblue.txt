Aaaand now you have to pay for bullets against you, cryptocurrencies and all the libertarian citizens with your gains from cryptocurrencies! How cruel is that.

Good governments do not exist, they will be replaced with the maintenance organizations, servicing your home, your street, city, police etc. We will see a tremendous change in the world in next decade.

If we are based on the reality of the banking system, where for any violation the banking license can be easily withdrawn, then it's practically impossible. An alternative to central bank currencies won't be provided in the banks, because it violates strict and restrictive capital and money laundering regulations (Basel 1-3, FATF).
Theoretically, yes, bitcoins in the banks would bring a lot of benefits for the consumers. Government decentralisation and deregulation would likewise bring tremendous benefits for people, but practically it's - just like crypto in the bank - impossible (yet).

The good thing, their opinion is not relevant, they will just disappear like everything economically unsustainable. It will be a revolution without a single bullet fired. Without money monopoly, today's government and banking systems are impossible.
The collapse will happen, when the cost to maintain gov forces, wars on citizen's freedoms will be higher, than all the tax incomes in the next decades combined (historically, it is the fifth stage of every empire).
