I seem the remember the opposite sentiment in here, elation, when the market was at it's peak only to then come crashing down.  Perhaps the opposite is true now or in the near future.  May be a while longer but just save up some cash and enjoy the low prices.  You wanna accumulate as much as you can before the price goes back up.  Low prices are a chance to build up your stash of the future if you believe  Just buy a little at a time.
