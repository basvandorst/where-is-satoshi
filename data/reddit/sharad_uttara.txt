Still taxable for any size profit? Seems crazy that they expect people to self-report their crypto trading.

OP is trolling trying to authenticate a bitcoin without assuming risk, like trying to date your boss without assuming any risk

It’s so obviously fear &amp; jealously when banks use virtues like the environment in arguments. When’s the last time a bank truly care about something like the environment?

I also work retail and love this post. I get so annoyed that I verbally walk every person that looks like they might struggle step by step through paying with a credit card and still have 10-20% do it wrong on the first try.

Any way to know how much the price is being increased due to the short squeeze? Also where can you see the number of btc currently being shorted?
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:01:34
28 btc! Wow I can’t believe how lucky some people get, I’ve been DCA for years and will never get to 28... I guess the old adage holds true, it’s better to be lucky than good

It’s possible that it is being priced in already but it hasn’t happened that way in any of the previous halvenings.

Came here to say this, happy to find that somebody else already did

I think he might be onto something with all this late-term abortion baby harvesting talk. Can’t wait to hear what he has to say about Soros and bitcoin.

Is the general consensus that robinhood is solvent in regards to btc?

People will follow closer once they are invested and learn as they go only making them more confident
@_date: 2019-06-10 03:08:38
Or look at it as pursing your interests and learning along the way. Might only break even financially but the lessons will have value too.

197,000,000 square miles/21,000,000 btc=9.4 square miles/btc

Would still be 64k!
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:43:29
Any other strategy is just guessing, don’t know if the run tops out at 16, 40, or 120k, but will look fairly obvious in hindsight.

I agree with you, there’s never been a better time to go all-in on bitcoin... and if you’re off by a few years, at least you tried.
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:23:00
This is the most appropriate place I can think of to argue about where the price of bitcoin will be in 10 years. tbh

A wash sale is a transaction in which an investor sells a losing security to claim a capital loss, only to repurchase it again (or purchase an identical security) within 30 days of the sale. Wash sales are a method investors employ to try and recognize a tax loss without limiting their exposure to the security.

I wish I bought 2017 ATH 
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:18:15
It could be seen as a way of increasing the supply without decreasing the value.

Great interview! Imagine if every local news station would show something this accurate and coherent. Best of luck to you and your company.
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:53:24
Do all the same rules apply to crypto in terms of short and long term capital gains/losses?
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:30:48
Almost always the case when btc is majorly on sale it’s actually bch :p

Labeling all thinking outside the official narrative as conspiratorial is lazy and only benefits those powerful enough to create the stories themselves.

Really enjoyed that, I encourage more of this type of sharing. I wouldn’t have found this video on my own even though I’m often looking for blockchain videos.

A month ago I had a much larger percent of my worth in btc, but even as I add the percentage keeps falling with the price.
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:12:48
Ignore the other comments, they are all clearly trolls. The nice thing about bitcoin is that it follows predictable cycles that are easy to spot. Wait to buy until the price is clearly in an uptrend and making new ath. Then hodl or sell as soon as the price has corrected and the bear market is clearly established. Rinse and repeat.

Interested in the portfolio help. Do you have an email or should I just DM you?

Whenever I’ve traded an equity after hours because I was in a hurry, it’s almost always turned out to be a poor trade that could have been done the next day or week at a better price.
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:04:29
Looks like the pattern this is based on is each cycle taking 600 days longer than the previous one.
