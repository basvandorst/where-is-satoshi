I'd argue it's worse to codify and legitimize corruption than remaining confined to hidden back-channels.

The problem with this statement is that capitalism is about monopolizing capital, and it is primarily about control. Making this entire post highly incoherent and nonsensical.

I don't think that's true. We have what, 90% congressional disapproval rating as well as maybe 10% electoral participation in most elections? It really doesn't matter because the options of what is possible are limited. Our political system only maintains an illusion of free will and choice, but it's between coke or pepsi, essentially.

That is correct. Tomorrow the fed could simply move a few decimal places on a computer screen and "print" the trillions needed to repay the debt, if it really wanted to.

Math is easy, but it is boring. Few people have the desire or inclination to learn it and the many formulas required.

You can't blame "voters" for the results of an inherently undemocratic system.
You can blame the population for allowing such a political system to exist, but that is a different argument.

You can keep repeating that but it doesn't make it true.

Well, that's quite an ideological statement that requires ignoring many parts of reality.

Well, it's a good thing we have supremely intelligent gentlemen like yourself to tell the dumb people what they should think or do.
But, regardless, if we accept this premise as true, then there is still the fundamental issue that an intelligent person, like yourself, who is misinformed and/or operating solely in their own personal interest, is still no better for society. In fact, that has been the general idea behind the gradual push for democracy to replace aristocracy over the centuries.
