That's because you shouldn't sell them, you should just HODL!
(using to buy things is not applicable)

This are the milestones for the 0.16, which "will most likely be the release of segwit wallet"
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:22:26
Ok, so tell me. In your opinion, who will use bitcoin and how many users using it daily the network should comport?
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:58:53
The *solution* does not solut the problem, since my analysis show the same problem appearing even if the solution works (and the number of users keep growing)
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:14:54
I can't deny that, but you can't assume either that moore's law will continue indefinitely. Also: Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:32:36
It's crazy to imagine a currency used by all of the people in the world?
So why are we talking about scalability in the first place?
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:33:55
Not, it's not fully implemented yet, as i said, you have to manually generate segwit address and manually configure a segwit address for the change
We can say that is half implemented
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:34:09
No, they don't (I tested it myself)
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:20:25
My extrapolation use conservative assumptions
If I have to consider everything, I will also have to consider than some transactions will not use LN to be made and guess how long does a node keeps their channels open, cause we don't have this numbers yet but I doubt it will be for a year
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:40:53
oh... yeah, you're right :/
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:48:01
You really never heard about him? Just search [peter schiff was right]( on Google, that's him
Apart from that well... He is a gold fan and thinks that bitcoin will drop to zero
That's all that I know about him, actually :v
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:10:40
More transactions being created every 10 minutes than a block can support is not a problem we're facing right now?
I mean, **literally** right now?
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:11:43
You mean, bisq?
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:10:24
That does not answer neither of my questions
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:45:57
I think than when Bitcoin Core fully implement SegWit we will see major exchanges and users doing the same. But if even the main bitcoin client haven't done it yet, makes things difficult, right?
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:09:42
Of course than the problem exist, that 100 MB mempool is there cause of what?
My post just show that it will only get worse
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:10:51
I know, that's why "Core" is inside a parentheses, since it was written this way just to differentiate the two more clearly
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:52:24
Pff, gold?!?
Pure Bitcoin, much better :v
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:09:37
The fact is that a lot of people say that LN is scalable to infinity and that's it's the solution for bitcoin scalability problems
But they seems to ignore the fact that even with the LN we will still need the blockchain, which will still be the scalability bottleneck, as we can see on the post
That can be solved is the future? Of course it can, but that doesn't mean it will, nor that we should ignore it
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:23:59
Yep. Since before the correction, actually
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:12:19
I have just used the paid service on a transactions stuck for 8 days, let's see if works
UPDATE: After 2 days Tx still not confirmed :/
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:19:18
Not exactly
The use of segWit in core is SUPPORTED, but yet completly manual, so, the implementation is "on going" and the automatic use SegWit address will likely be done in the next major core upgrade
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:11:00
0.16 is not released yet, and not recommended for use at all, but you can always download and compile the current github branch yourself
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:59:02


you can create a segwit wallet using electrum
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:55:46
It is a blocksize increase without a hardfork, done in a very intelligent way, btw
But, segwit was created so solve the malleability issue, everything else is profit
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:19:35
If A opens a channel with B, A can pay B
B can receive a LN payment thought the channel A opened and B didn't needed to open a channel for that
So, the answer for


Is: Someone needs to open a channel with that person
Not only that, but, let's suppose A opens a channel with B, A can **NOT** receive a payment through that channel (yet) cause the channel is "full" (I don't know if that's the right word for this situation)
A has to pay someone with that channel, so then it's not 'fully loaded' anymore and then A can receive funds through it
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:30:03
Yes, you can, but it is a manually process and the address of change has to be manually setted to the SegWit address too
SegWit in Core is not finished yet, when i does, exchanges and pretty much everyone will use it
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:47:10
Where did I contradict myself?
Core supports the SwgWit address and i think that sending fully segwit transactions too
But the proccess is not automatic, you have to create the address manually and manually set the change address if i remember correctly
As I said, it is not done yet, AND one of the things that is not done yet is the GUI
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:15:25
Exchanges to convert BTC to other cryptos?
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:10:08
The work is being done, but the Core GUI does not support SegWit yet, probably on the next major update
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:05:42


I would say that both things are connected


In this case, bitcoin will have to comport 63 tps and an average block size of 21,6 MB
Its still a pretty huge block
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:28:14
Ok, so the network should scale to comport how many users?
And why the number you choose and not a bigger one?
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:28:59
Do you have and source for that?
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:28:17
A troll? Seriously?
I made a post that **literaly** said


and your calling me a troll just because I wanted to make things clear putting "Core" inside parentheses? What the hell?
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:22:34
Peter Schiff, he got famous (at least for me xD) cause he was (one of the) the guy(s) who predicted the 2008 crisis (since at least 2005)
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:44:39
@_date: 2018-01-30 06:01:35
Cause we are masochists
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:56:13
If I trusted u I would say your right, but I don't, so I wouldn't 
@_date: 2018-05-14 03:06:13
What exactly do you mean with that?
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:06:38
I believe in gold only if it is my own hands
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:15:50


Agree. Thanks for the reply
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:24:10
I mean that: In the moment I've posted I was completely blind on this question. Didn't know anything
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:10:51


He bring up arguments, I don't know the veracity of them, that's why I asked
You can't consider every criticism on Bitcoin as conspiracy, that's how you set up a buble
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:01:39


That makes quite sense, actually. But the best thing to do isn't ignore them, but explain why those critics are wrong
Something that was (actually) pretty well done on this post
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:07:56
It was a sincere question, it wasn't a misleading conspiracy bs, **it was a doubt**
Thks for the link anyway
@_date: 2019-02-02 16:24:10
I would say 105.23% is more accurate
@_date: 2018-03-10 04:18:53
Welcoming supportive? Nope, none of the bitcoin fits this
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:46:36
Well, it seems the BCH community cried a lot to coinbase and they decided to change the original text
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:25:14
Stocks are going up cause FED is printing money like a crazy dumbass, of course we hate it :)
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:13:20
It's too soon to say that
Btw, anyone knows why today's pump?
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:42:32
Pretty much everything
