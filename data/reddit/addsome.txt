Yes it would give more profit that time. But over time you maybe be able to gain more by just hodling unless you learn the ins and outs of day trading. For the 3rd one you'd lose money because bitcoin would increase in value and you'd buy back less than what you sold for the same money.

That's exactly it. It could:
1. Dip and you buy bottom, profit.
2. Dip and you miss bottom, less profit.
3. Not dip and you lose money
No one knows exactly what will happen. Look at some analysis and see what you think.

What's a good SimpleDNScrypt alternative for Linux and Android?

But no one knows what exactly the top of the next ATH is and what the bottom of the next dip is. That's when you look at TA and make an educated guess.

My ether wallet works via ledger and android?

That sucks, I'm surprised there's no way to reset even if he has email access
