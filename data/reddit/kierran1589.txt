I'm not forcing anyone to do anything. I'm merely offering my opinion, which is to chill out a bit and believe in BTC longterm. People can take the advice or leave it.
I would disagree with your commodity remark. I take no political sides in the BTC vs BCH/BCC drama but there is an issue with BTC scalability and transaction fees. If this isn't sorted out inline with mainstream adoption I believe it will be BTC's undoing. I really hope this isn't the case.

Haha yes! But do you think the masses understand this? "limited supply of 21 million" is a great selling point and creates extra urgency to buy. You are of course right though :)

Again, I disagree.
I believe BTC will be worth hundreds of thousands in the future. If anything, advising people to cash out now is bad advice. (Hypothetically) buy in at £10,000 and cash out out £12,000 because you fear a dip.. or HODL for a year or 2 and cash out at £50k+. Of course, there are no guarantees and there are risks involved, so I could be wrong.
I'd be more interested in your arguments as to why BTC won't be worth $100k+ in the long term future though, as opposed to petty arguments about giving "bad advice" to people even though I put a disclosure on my post saying "but hey...what do I know?". It was my opinion, that is all.
I'm also part of this group. I've invested around £1,500 and so far hold around £7,500. Not much in the big scheme of things. Point being, I could have cashed out at BTC value £3,000, £4,000, £5,000, £6,000... and the list goes on. During each milestone there has usually being a significant dip. I've HODL'd though and i'm very glad that I did each time! I think I'm in a decent position to offer my anecdotal opinion to people in similar positions to me, thank you very much. By all means though, explain to me why less well off people to cash out now rather than HODL long-term for significantly bigger returns?
Yes you're correct, apologies. I misread commodity for currency.

Agreed! I'm also weary of this. But at the same time, isn't this the whole point of bitcoin? Can the government stop something that's inherently decentralised?
Haha! I think we're both on the same page after all! I hold XRP and NEO as well. Certainly not banking it all on BTC!!

You are probably correct. For BTC to reach it's full potential though we are going to need the masses to see it as a genuine commodity. I'm not naive enough to expect that to happen soon though.

I'm no expert but just my 2-cents in response to students/less rich people worried about cashing out now before a potential dip.
There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in circulation. I haven't checked right now but I believe around 16,500,000 have been mined. If BTC will ever fall to pieces it will be after all 21 million has been mined and the big players all cash out (personally I hope scalability is sorted out by this point so BTC can shit all over FIAT and the price will skyrocket to crazy crazy levels). 
I'm a relatively poor guy from the UK and I'm taking a risk putting in 70% of my earnings into BTC and other cryptos but I'm not overly concerned TBH. Whether BTC is a commodity or not at this stage, there's too much vested interest from big players for the prices to cease rising, especially with bitcoin futures and hedge funds now getting involved. I mean hell! BTC is still in early adoption and is only now starting to make mainstream news on a consistent basis. I got in at £2200 and I've been anxious at every rise and fall, but not so much anymore. The one thing I do know about BTC is... HODL!
But hey.. what do I know?
