Yeah, the average from the previous crashes is -86% from ath after a 5-9k% rally. If ath is ~20k that would put target at 2,8k so your right on the dot there.

Buy it and transfer it. The transfer fees are from the miners not coinbase, not a lot you can do about the fees. Generally, you can choose your fee, a lower fee will mean longer transfer time, but i'm not sure if coinbase has that option.

You're laptop most likely doesn't have the computational power to mine Bitcoin. Even if it did, if you live in a western country, the mere cost of electricity would be bigger than your profit of Bitcoin.

I was speaking between wallets, I guess you would want to give away a wallet containing btc. 
But yeah there is a fee for buying the bitcoin as well.

So this is a good gift in thought but not in practice. First off, the mere storage of Bitcoin is hard. Hardware wallet? Well, just that is $80+ w/o the Bitcoin. Paper wallet? Easy to lose and hard to use for a newcomer.
Now the biggest problem is not the wallet per say, it's the transfer fee which is extraordinary high right now. Transfer can easily cost you $15-20 if you're unlucky, which means you have to buy a lot for it to even be worth it. What's the point of giving away $20 in btc if it will be eaten up by transfer fees?

Bitcoin is totally up 1160% from hype and branding. 
This does not mean that it doesn't have utility and is very useful. It worked wonders during the cyprus banking crisis, during the greek crisis, for venezuela, for everybody not able to invest or transfer wealth any other way.
Look, I'm a Bitcoin fanatic, I've been interested since I first read about it 2011 and I even make yt about it. It has enormous potentials, but we have to be real and realize that it also has serious flaws.
One problem is that the fees will just keep going up along with the appreciation in value, but people will still be investing the same amount of money each month (in the case of dca). So those 100 bucks people are saving each month won't be worth anything when fees right now are eating 25% of that and it's increasing.
Bitcoin, historically, has had a real problem with getting changes through mainly because a lot of users have a hard time being level headed about decisions. It's never wise to act like a cult around something, It makes you go blind to what can be improved.
Another problem is this rapid growth in power usage and we're just going to hear more about it. This will no doubt lead to regulation in one way or another.

We're planning on it! There are tons of interesting subjects. One I'm particularly interested in is how Bitcoin will react in a stock market crash since Bitcoin is uncorrelated to the stock market. 
We'll be releasing 1-2 videos/week, hope you'll tune in!

Hey guys, Niklas and I have been interested in Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain for a few years and decided to start a youtube channel as a side project. 
We want to fill it with our thoughts and (later on) analysis on the cryptomarket covering both the technicals and economics. 
We kept this first video short and pretty basic to test the waters, and it’s a bit rough around the edges (big mistake keeping notes on computers in front of us).
 
Since we visit daily we’d love to hear some feedback on our material as we want to make great content that is interesting to watch.
