It's a strange behavior of tutanota.de website. It is applying some client-side code after content is loaded ... we are collecting websites that use some nonstandard way of providing login dialogues and trying to fix it for future releases
Please, do not hesitate and report it to our support. I will take a look at it as soon as possible!

to edit venue informations, you have to be logged in &amp; open popup -&gt; actions -&gt; report and now you can choose to report wrong informations or claim venue if it is yours ...

it make crypto out of the computer and you have to make an action shown on the trezor display - so nobody can just steal your password and decipher them on their own

PRO TIP for USERS:
when you login to Password Manager you can see yellowish badge in the corner of extension icon
- when you save the entry for example facebook and later on visit facebook website, you can see badge change the color to blue .... then if you press SHIFT + ALT + F on the facebook website, trezor ask you for permission and extension try to find and fill login form for you.
Also you can try SHIFT + ALT + T for quick opening of extension.
These shortcuts should work - only sometimes they are screwed up due to reserved strokes by other application ...
