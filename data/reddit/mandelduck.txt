tokens do not need to move, the cards in the game are not spent when used. All the game needs to do is verify that the user has the cards. This can/is been done via message signing and a block explorer

Yes we are thinking about similar incentive systems, however we just wanted to soft launch with some trusted token droppers before we open it up, work out the bugs etc
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:12:42
Hopefully early October 
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:49:06
Yes as XCP is stored on the bitcoin blockchain, I guess you can think of it like another ledger on the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2016-08-20 09:10:24
It doesnt cost XCP to send counterparty tokens, it only costs btc
@_date: 2016-08-26 06:55:47
This is completely on the mark,
We can hope to see many other games allowing use of Spell of Genesis cards in order to attract the SoG user base
@_date: 2016-08-12 11:51:49
So far as I understand btc will not be directly used as a currency but the game items will be tokens on the bitcoin blockchain, I think they will also have their own game currency token on the bitcoin blockchain
When BTC is enabled on the counterparty decentralized exchange these tokens will all be exchangeable for btc.
@_date: 2016-08-13 07:23:13
I meant for game play but for trading yes it will be on chain
@_date: 2016-08-01 15:30:42
you dont have to, you can add any wallet address
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:56:57
I guess the fee will determine that, if people are willing to pay the fee to put something on the blockchain it should go on the blockchain
But the game/s itself does not need to use transactions in order to use the blockchain game items
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:29:05
thanks :-)
@_date: 2016-08-01 19:01:49
There is no api, the iOS breadwallet supports x-call-back
so you can call a uri scheme to open breadwallet app from your app and it will return the users address
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:07:59
So this is a misconception, tokens or items do no have to be moved in order to use them in many games.
All the games can/will link with the users wallet that holds the tokens and via message signing verification the game can verify that the user has the cards/item/token
@_date: 2016-08-01 15:15:38
Users who drop bitcoin always keep a record of that bitcoins private key in the "History" tab
so they can recover, or restore when ever they like
@_date: 2016-04-02 09:34:30
I recommend CoinJar, never had a problem with them

the article wasn't meant to be about which tech is best for gaming, it was how gaming could specifically help the lightning network, but that network doesnt have to be bitcoin specific, it could also be on other blockchain as well

SaruTobi is not open source,
It doesn't have to be either as it doesnt hold users bitcoin ;-)
@_date: 2015-12-20 11:09:02
look forward to it ;-)
@_date: 2015-12-19 21:30:20
the SaruTobi game is only on iOS, 
however indieWallet is for Android and iOS
There are plenty of Android bitcoin games available though ;-)
@_date: 2015-06-08 02:19:14
Hi, please make your own game I hoped that by making SaruTobi it would inspire other developers.
I can't speak for Android but I can give you advice on Apple.
We had to change the coins because Apple said it was against their policy for a game to represent a virtual currency incorrectly, i.e. they said as the Bitcoins in the game were not Bitcoins we should change them.  However in my other game,  Game of Birds im still using the Bitcoin image and they didn't say anything.
 Apple don't allow you to purchase in app items using anything other than apples "in-app purchase" system this is why I chose to do Bitcoin tipping rather then Bitcoin spending.
However they class the game under their "Gambling rules"
Which means I had to
1. set the rating to 17+
2. not allow the game to be sold in China
3. Include a disclaimer saying "apple does not sponsor the game"
Also they said that getting the coins had to be based on skill and luck and that buying the in-app purchase for bananas would not let you get more Bitcoin.
i.e. you cant let the user buy bitcoin via an in-app purchase it has to be a reward/tip that is not guaranteed.
But it's really up to Apple and which reviewer you get so its best to contact them directly
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:34:03
Hi, I am the dev, I would love to bring it to Android in the future ;-) but in the mean time I recommend Bitcoin Flapper on the play store
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:18:42
as mentioned above if you optionally donate bitcoin we will send you sarutobi coin back ;-)
@_date: 2015-06-08 02:59:56
Thats what I said, many games use the "dollar" as an in game coin.
I think at the end of the day they are just concerned about their users, Bitcoin is quite confusing to most people and there are a lot of scams taking advantage of that, (hence they were unhappy with the use of Bitcoin as an ingame coin).
Ss long as you keep the users in mind and make it clear what your doing you should be ok.
So your a team of 3 developers in Tokyo? do you go to the Bitcoin meet up there?
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:34:22

Yep, they added this functionality in to developers integrate

Apple says the game contains gambling and therefor is automatically banned from certain countries
@_date: 2015-06-07 09:02:04
out of interest what is it that you dont like about Xapo? coinbase gets a lot of hate on Reddit as well
@_date: 2015-06-08 05:06:33
Sounds good ;-)
@_date: 2015-12-20 11:13:22
I think as long as your iPhone is not jailbroken it is safe, if a malicious app were to make it on the app store I highly doubt it would be able to access another app's keychain data, not even Apple can do that!
@_date: 2015-06-01 02:33:21
Good for Bitcoin Billionarie! I hope it can find it's way onto new and noteworthy, having a Bitcoin app go viral would do a lot for Bitcoin! Thats what I hope to do with SaruTobi
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:12:31
fixed to 21 million
@_date: 2015-06-08 04:01:20
thats a good idea and I think you'll be fine, Apple are becoming less strict about Bitcoin.
If your ever in Tokyo let me know
@_date: 2015-06-08 02:05:38
Yes I have, but I am an iOS developer by trade however I would love to look at it in the future
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:46:10
Apple changed the search function so even if you search with the exact name it may not show up, as the tittle is Game of birds you get a lot of flappy birds clone appearing in the result

An update is with Apple to change that but thanks for changing it over

Also blockcypher sounds interesting I will take a look
@_date: 2015-06-08 02:25:59
If the user enters an email it is done off blockchain through Xapo, however if the user enters a wallet address it is done on the blockchain, I am looking at was to change this however its difficult as players want the ability to use their wallet address and no have to go through a 3rd party such as coinbase of xapo
Im open to any ideas

It is on going, basically the game has a tip Pot, bitcoin is added to this pot. if the pot has Bitcoin in it then players will receive tips after playing for x Amount of time.
If this pot is empty then players wont receive tips.
This pot relies on donations from patreons, players and my self
You can donate here

The reason we are asking for donations is we are largely non profit as the app earnings currently go back to the players as bitcoin. We are also not funded so any donations just allow me (the dev) a bit more free time from my day job to work on the Android build. Plus it gives a chance for users to get our SaurTobi counterparty token.
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:58:54
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:44:45
I dont want to give too many details about the solution, but the fact it is on ios helps alot, but basic speed checking was added etc,
also the user is encouraged to add a question to the takara, one that only somebody who is there would answer.
Also wouldn't people be able to fake their location to collect all the coins?
having said that we are not arrogant enough to be 100% sure hence we have disabled dropping for a few days.
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:59:54
sorry I am an iOS dev, so I can't create Android apps, I am looking for funding though, and If I get it I can work on versions for other platforms

If you want to use a btc address please try SaruTobi as it now does pay out to your btc address instead of just a Xapo account
GoB is a collaboration with Coinbase and initialy it will requrie a coinbase account
@_date: 2016-03-19 05:59:41
It would be up to the individual stores to accept bitcoin payments so Japan legally making Bitcoin a currency wouldn't mean you could instantly use it in every store. However there is a place for Digital currencies in Japan as most japanese don't use/trust/like credit cards meaning everything is cash based, even when buying online people pay with cash on delivery, so maybe this means theres a market for bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:09:32
No it should be stuck forever,
May I ask are you using a location spoofing app on a jailbroken phone? or do you have other methods?
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:46:08
I don`t think you need to actually send the cards on chain if you want to use them. There is one transaction needed to get a card but after then it just sits in your wallet and can be used.

actually though a similar thing, but with AR, you scan a qrcode and the balance pops out
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:44:19

famously DMM.com one of the largest online retail sites introduced bitcoin payments. This week a company called GMO enabled bitcoin payments, I actually spoke with one of the GMO representatives the other day and he confirmed that they want to attract foreign customers.

Somebody has just informed me about another bitcoin geocaching app on android called coinplanter 
Seems they have similar algorithms to prevent against spoofing
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:43:46
Breadwallet will generate new addresses each time, this is to protect privacy 
But don't worry all the address are actually children of a master address inside the app.
So no matter which address you send bitcoin too the app will sum all the balances together.
To go into more detail you can kinda think of your recovery phrase as your master root address and all your new bitcoin address are children of it, but all related to each other.
@_date: 2017-02-03 23:45:02

That actually does sound like a good idea, and bitcoin sounds perfect for it, unfortunately my plate is full with takara and my other apps so I don't have the time to spare, but maybe it's something you could get funding for.
@_date: 2016-01-27 12:03:56
no worries don't hesitate to ask any questions or give feedback
And yes the app will send you a push notification when somebody picks up your takara, (but if you have the app open you wont see it, will fix that in an update)
@_date: 2016-01-28 00:27:26

I agree and respect your view on open source to answer your questions data is stored encrypted, I have no monetary incentives at the moment, yes I have access to the database. 
I am not saying my app is a super secure exchange, it is possible for me to take dropped takara, the wallet on the app is secure and I do not have access to the bitcoin stored on it as the users private key never leaves the app.
You mean users would need to physically leave a private key at a location?
@_date: 2016-03-26 05:18:25

@_date: 2016-01-23 13:45:42
**A lot of people have been asking about the security of the app, do I store private keys? what about location spoofing? etc. Here are my answers**
I have special algorithms to detect location spoofing however I admit this is not 100% spoof proof. The app warns the user of this when they drop bitcoin and tells them to add a question and answer that only somebody at the location would know.
The private key of the bitcoin is then stored on our server, the private key is encrypted with the answer to the question. We do not store the answer, meaning that even we can't decrypt the private key without getting the answer right. This also means if the server is compromised the private keys are encrypted.
The app has a secure wallet built in and signs all it's transaction on the app meaning the private key of the users wallet never leaves.
The private key of the users wallet is stored in the iOS keychain.
Having said this I will be honest and I don't promise 100% security, the app is a game not a secure exchange.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:21:11
the user pays the transaction fees, so if they drop $3, they have to spend $3.50
@_date: 2016-01-16 01:18:59
Haha yes I agree, I plan to post more formally later, I just think its important to help clear out the noise with other stories
@_date: 2016-03-07 04:21:42
It is possible to upgrade the hashing algorithm bitcoin uses to something stronger in the future, my understanding is seg wit will make it even easier to do so.
@_date: 2016-03-04 11:25:32
I bought a beer the other day and noticed the store used coincheck, I wondered if I set zero fee and paid and the transaction is stuck in the mempool, or I double spend, who loses out, coincheck or the merchant? 
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:48:52
Yes, just need to test the security on iOS, if that is ok we will look at Android. Android is less secure than ios and easier to hack hence the delay.
@_date: 2016-01-23 21:35:17
I made my own coin "sarutobi" for my game, using the indiesquare wallet app. it uses counterparty and lets you set the coin icon, name, amount etc
@_date: 2016-01-23 08:12:41
I think that's a better way and defiantly more difficult to spoof, yet still possible.
@_date: 2016-01-23 14:10:11
The bitcoin is encrypted with the users answer to their question so we can't take it.
As for the bar/restaurant who dropped it they will see who collected it as when bitcoin is claimed the user who dropped is notified.

@_date: 2016-01-22 15:25:20
Thanks, the idea has been around for a while but it is a difficult game to develop with bitcoin due to location spoofing, anyway we believe we found an solution.
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:34:42
I contacted steam to see if this is the case
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:25:19
Somebody did spoof their location but the app detected it was spoofed and didnt let them pick up the takara,
however I have taken the extra precaution of forcing users to add a question that only somebody at the location would know. If a user gets the answer wrong too many times the app puts a time limit until they can answer again (this stop possible brute force attempts)
The answer to this question also encrypts the bitcoins private key (even I can't decrypt it)
There are some takara that I dropped with no question in Antartica, if these are picked up then I know at least somebody managed to trick the gps
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:45:51
various technical aspects, and jailbreaking detection, I realize that all ios version will eventually be broken so we may support older iOS version later.
@_date: 2016-01-27 01:24:41
I would probably announce that questions will always be compulsory due to a successful spoof.
@_date: 2016-03-19 05:04:37
I am currently living in Japan and I feel that many online sites see Bitcoin as a way to open up their sales to international customers.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:12:33


actually the app does check for jailbroken devices and politely tells the user 
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:48:58
Yes as Nicolas said you can use nbitcoin in unity, but you may not need to add anything to unity, what you want to do can and probably should be done on your server

@_date: 2016-01-23 00:57:37
thanks, the crashing may be intentional depending on what you're doing the app will shutdown
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:50:00


Thanks for trying out! I see you spoofed your location, thats fine the app should detect this and not let you collect takara. There is takara dropped in Antartica, can you collect it?
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:55:24
I mean you can store them on your trezor, just you wont be able to get them off your trezor at the moment
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:47:46
Your correct I could collect these bounties for my self, but users take a risk with a game, they shouldn't trust any wallet by the same logic, even open source wallets may differ from the actual app store binary.
The app doesn't rely on security via obscurity but all else considered publicly releasing source code and methods will only help people spoof. 
Even if the location is spoofed the question and answer protects the bitcoin, however it limits where bitcoin can be dropped, thats the only problem.
what do you mean by?  
"I would prefer people posted public keys and GPS locations to find a private key and password to unlock the prize."
I'm always interested into others insights?

correct! it is NOT case sensitive, but good idea to tell the user that in the app, will add it in an update
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:15:07
hmm your iphone must have some jailbroken related files left over, I suppose a factory restore may work
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:33:56
yes the private key of the takara is stored encrypted on the server, 
However if the users adds a question, the private key is further encrypted with their answer which I don't store.
Meaning that even I can't decrypt the private key with out asking the user what their answer is!
@_date: 2016-01-23 02:16:48
Yeah I agree with you, but you can say that about any service such as coinbase etc
If users really don't trust me they don't have to use the app and users who don't but are willing to risk small amounts can do so. I do warn the users in the app to not store Bitcoin with the app and recommend breadwallet as a safer solution.
I think this a broader issue with software, software and software developers aren't not audited by an official standards body, any company could be stealing your private info.
As for the app I kind think having the user dropping physical keys would not really take off, on the other hand another Reddit user mentioned having users encrypt the private key I store with text found at the location as the password would work.
I couldn't steal the Bitcoin, and even if the user spoofed they wouldn't be able to know the password. Currently the user is told to add a question in case the location is spoofed.
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:21:53
Your not wrong, keep in mind the time between questions can increase exponentially, also it is no easy to create multiple accounts as accounts are tied to the device it's self.
I am fairly confident that the algorithms combined with the questions will be enough to address the problem, having said that when the app is first released we will supply the Bitcoin that is dropped so if any exploits are found users won't be affected.
@_date: 2017-02-04 02:45:38
it links to a mempool via websocket so when a new transaction is added to the pool the app gets notified and spawns a gem
@_date: 2016-01-23 02:17:33
That sound interesting will take a look
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:41:02
These guys saw what I saw when I first heard about Bitcoin, limited supply but unlimited use
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:57:27
I agree with your comments, the only way to ensure a user is actually there is as you said have a physical object at the location.
However I was unable to trick the app with a fake location, having said that I am not arrogant enough to assume it can't be done.
Hoping that the majority of dropped bitcoin will be business who add a password to the takara, a password that is written in side the store, like a wifi password on the board.
Anyway based on initial feedback the app may change models to something a bit stricter on this
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:48:10
lol it would be safer in a paper wallet!

@_date: 2016-01-23 00:13:59
it could give clues to a people on how to trick the location spoofing checks
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:50:46
We may do that, the idea is bars/restaurants can add a question like 
"whats the password?"
then users must go inside and ask the staff for the password
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:58:44
Hi, no worries, I get that, we will be adding support for regular Bitcoin addresses soon! 
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:16:39
sure would work, but just having a password to stop access is enough
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:55:01
nope but actually you will be able to on ledger soon
@_date: 2015-05-03 08:19:14
I just signed up, I think they just need users
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:46:45
Well the app isn't a business, I don't currently make a profit, I am just interested in promoting bitcoin and making it easier for people to get some.
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:33:55
yes the private key of the takara is stored encrypted on the server, 
However if the users adds a question, the private key is further encrypted with their answer which I don't store.
Meaning that even I can't decrypt the private key with out asking the user what their answer is!
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:18:52
yes, I will let users know when dropping is available
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:12:45
sure I guess so!
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:24:02
I agree with you, this is the major problem, but a problem that is solvable, Google have done this with ingress.
But to answer you concerns this is why takara is only on iOS as it is much easier to stop spoofing
We have a few algorithms to detect spoofing and the amount of time you have to wait before re-answering questions increases each time you get the answer wrong, (so brute force would be ineffective)
We hope that these factors mitigate the spoofing problem
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:15:59
Apologies, we tried an unsuccessful crowdfunding campaign to build an android version, but there are plenty of bitcoin games on android ;-)

Minimum is 10% max is 100%, of course you don't have to donate it is an optional feature.
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:40:04
Yeah SaruTobi is a stupid pointless game, time playing it could be spent on more useful things. But The point is with tools such as counterparty tokens can be used permissionless in any games, terrible ones and great ones. The same tokens in one game such as Spells of Genesis could be used as game items in another game.
@_date: 2016-03-18 15:08:17
We developed a game called SaruTobi and created a counterparty token SARUTOBI token for the game, players can purchases the token using bitcoin and use the token to unlock power ups etc. So we find counterparty useful in gaming. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 18:19:33
Now everybody knows where they stand
@_date: 2016-06-08 16:34:46
I think in the Counterparty team are working on an update to use BTC instead/aswell as XCP
@_date: 2016-06-18 13:36:12
SoG hasn't launched yet, so it is difficult to know what user base it will have. As for the other projects we will see towards the end of the year, all i've heard are proposals so nothing concrete and I don't want to mislead or cause any hype
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:37:54
I would add that generally I think Japanese people know a lot more then they say, it's a cultural thing, humility not showing off etc

@_date: 2016-06-18 02:41:33
Counterparty tokens usage is gaining momentum in Japan, towards the end of this year there are some big projects run on counterparty planned such as Apps, games and even TV personality usage 
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:38:21
I guess the emphasis is on fun game, I'm not going to lie and say i'm as secure as a bank and takara is not a place to store bitcoin. 
Users who drop drop at their risk, and I assume they will drop bitcoin they are happy to give to somebody else, of course I appreciate they want it to be picked up legitimately.
This is why I advise them to add a question/answer in the app.
The private key of the dropped bitcoin is then encrypted with their answer, 
I do not store the answer so even if wanted to steal the bitcoin I couldn't.
But of course you've only got my word for believe this.
I could make it open source but then how can you be sure the app and server code is the same as the open source code?
@_date: 2016-01-23 08:13:45
Thanks will take a look!
@_date: 2016-06-18 08:24:33

Spells of Genesis is one to look out for
but the others are really only familiar to Japanese audiences. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:35:06
its to prove you own an address, for example I can say I own an addres that has 100btc on it, but how do I prove that with out moving the coins?
sign message lets you sign a message which produces a signature that can be used with the address you claim to own to prove ownership
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:43:39
not really as having the public key doesnt mean you can spend the coins
also wallet address is technically the public key in a different format.
In order to spend coins you need the private key, and signing a message is done with the private key
the signature is a kind of finger print of the private key I guess
@_date: 2016-11-16 15:00:24

I would say it could work on the precious settlement layer for some assets, i.e. if the assets them selves are high value then people wouldnt mind paying a high fee to send them.
And yes counterparty does have a pull request for a payment channel  that is in development
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:27:34
is it because you only broadcast your tx rather than others hence anything your broadcast is known to probably be yours?
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:13:38
its strange you created the post as today I was devloping my own wallet and looking into passphrase, I too wondered if the passphrase I used could be imported into breadwallet, you could always email breadwallet and ask them
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:49:52
I second that, I think you can also set blocks only mode to reduce bandwidth
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:31:08
type "wipe" (letters only) into the recover passphrase field
@_date: 2015-08-30 15:14:05
it is possible at least with a standard private key import.
With a passphrase im not 100% sure, I assume if both apps conform to the BIP-0039 protocol for their passphrase then it should, but they may implement it differently, maybe somebody else can shed more light on it
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:02:36
Yes SaruTobi switched over to Coinbase, nothing wrong with Xapo their services were great however each time a new user signs up due to the app Coinbase add Bitcoin to the game, so it helps keep the pot full
And you can link breadwallet or use a regular Bitcoin address as well
@_date: 2019-06-30 09:16:00
so it maybe makes sense to use Orbot with ABCore in blocks only mode?
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:05:04
Yes they are releasing a debit card, I received a pre release Xapo card and it works great.

One takara could also be a clue to other takaras answers
@_date: 2019-04-16 10:45:59
nice! I dont think its about seeing it on the big screen its more about being able to download a full node app and run on whatever device you may have
@_date: 2016-02-10 11:40:38
currently yes only on iOS
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:25:18
no, the idea is at first most cards are normal database game items like a regular game, but when you level them up to their max level you will have the chance to tokenize them to a blockchain token giving you ownership of the item and hence the ability to trade, use in other applications etc.
You can also currently purchase token/blockchain versions of the card to use in game, collect, trade
@_date: 2017-04-28 03:07:34
for iOS, Android and possibly pc
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:18:45

That's a shame, may I ask what the question was? And where was it dropped?
@_date: 2017-04-22 05:32:59
issue is resolved now
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:46:16
ah I misread your question, yes to purchase a card it takes an on chain transaction, but to use a card is off chain, you just link a wallet and the game reads it balance to determine if you have that card
@_date: 2016-02-06 00:46:09
I think in know the guy who dropped in the bank of Japan, will let him know.
As for the coolest man did you try satoshi nakamoto? It could be roger ver also, I know the dropper is a fan of him.

It's not but the question doesn't have to be relevant its just a precaution, but if the user is willing to take the risk they can.
Also people can drop takara any where in the world by tapping on the map, but obviously they can't go everywhere in the world

not sure, I used this framework for a very small function, I do loop through the inputs, so maybe you can also loop through the outputs
$transaction = TransactionFactory::fromHex($unsignedHex);
$builder = new TransactionBuilder(Bitcoin::getEcAdapter(), $transaction);
foreach ($transaction-&gt;getInputs()-&gt;getInputs() as $idx =&gt; $input) {
	
   			 $outputScript = $input-&gt;getScript();
    
    		
@_date: 2016-09-24 03:00:08
Well you don't have to make all you game assets blockchain, SoG does not do that. You can can develop a great game with normal items, and enrich it with some blockchain game items.
having blockchain game items, particularly on counterparty lets players trade your items on the counterparty Decentralized exchange, so you do not have to worry about running a trading platform or security.
Plus the rarity of the game items can be locked and verified if needed
I am a big fan of other games and platforms been able to utilise the game items, as they are on the blockchain it offers permisonless innovation 
For example SoG cards can be geocached and collected in the counterparty token geocaching app takara and other games can offer them as ingame items aswell, I does this with Sarutobi, you can use SoG cards as powerups

@_date: 2015-11-06 04:55:22
There have been quite a few apps on the app store that send the user bitcoin, Apple don't really mind that, the big challenge is to get apps that allow you to buy in game items with bitcoin! Game of Birds kind of lets you do that, you can get more bombs and optional pay in bitcoin as a thank you donation.
@_date: 2015-03-19 03:22:52
Haha yes, they said that was a requirement,
I think you just need to include that the tip is not guaranteed
How are you funding the pot by the way? that was the most difficult thing I found
@_date: 2016-05-20 07:15:39
there should be an update with a let go button
you just need to press "use buttons" when starting the game, its hiding in the bottom right corner ;-)
@_date: 2015-11-06 04:54:05
Generally Apple are ok as long as the user is not buying ingame items with Bitcoin, giving the user bitcoin was never a problem after they allowed wallets back in the app store
@_date: 2016-05-21 03:40:59
I think you are correct there will be a lot of non value tokens, but there is a chance that games will tend to share some tokens in order to attract players, and those are the ones that could be worth something. This is really just a thought experiment so I am not saying it will happen 100%
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:37:39
Yes the main reason for adding Bitcoin to the game was to see if Apple would allow it.
They did, and I hope that this will spur on other developers to start integrating Bitcoin into their applications, 
I just had thought if a game as viral as flappy bird sent the user Bitcoins, how many more people it would introduce to the Cryptocurrency!
@_date: 2016-05-12 01:25:56
yes, but as the cards are assets on the blockchain anybody can re-sell them for whatever they want, so it is possible to buy cards for XCP, or for Bitcoin, dollars etc
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:33:45
The "Sold out" issue can be caused if your system clock on the device is not set to automatic time and date,
as for the "please connect to the internet..."  is that appearing in all scenarios and on the ipad aswell?
@_date: 2015-10-21 04:10:30
what device are you using?
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:26:45


I will check it out, actually I can imagine a potential issue with swipe on large screen I may have overlooked.
Thanks for your feedback
@_date: 2016-05-07 08:03:16
haha it was the font that did it, maybe the tulip trust is true and they noticed the similarity themselves, or MGS inspired their scam.
@_date: 2016-05-12 03:26:08
that can happen, game 1 devs can create the assets and give them to players at a high cost, and then the devs of game 2 can somehow acquire these assets at a cheap rate and give them to their players at  a low cost
but theres not much incentive to do so 
@_date: 2016-05-17 00:04:00
I know that counterparty will soon integrate smart contracts, and counterparty runs on top of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-23 06:21:10
agree! it is also so nice to use bitcoin in a way you dont have to worry about the price 
@_date: 2016-05-22 07:44:22
The free BTC is generally the ad revenue converted into bitcoin
@_date: 2016-05-12 03:27:14
yes on the site you need bitcrystals, but there are swapbots that can let you purchase using other tokens,
for example the Sarutobicard can be bought cheaper using sarutobitokens then it can be with bitcrystals
@_date: 2016-05-07 16:25:03
I guess the point of the article is that it is exploding in a different way, not the typical bitcoin as a currency but bitcoin as a customizable asset
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:11:39


Glad to see other developers are integrating Bitcoin as well! The game looks cool, but I don't have an android device, so Ill check it out on iOS
Its frustrating submitting to Apple, SaruTobi came under their "Sweepstakes" policy as the Bitcoin is not guaranteed and is a tip.
 
@_date: 2016-05-12 01:23:26
Gamers who spend hours of their time earning rare game items will no longer lose that value when they finish the game
@_date: 2015-10-22 04:02:49
no problem
@_date: 2016-05-22 23:49:01
great idea ;-)
you can use a ninja suit in swing thing
@_date: 2016-05-20 11:47:27
the multiplier issue has been fixed, it is meant to be a plus so now that is shown.
Also you can now use buttons in flyby mode for easier swing and swipe
@_date: 2016-05-19 04:29:23
I agree, if more games incorporate blockchain items then it could defiantly be a killer app, excited for Spells of Genesis
@_date: 2016-05-20 13:57:30
thanks, may I ask what android device you are using? it is possible that the swipe is detect different on different screens
@_date: 2016-05-07 16:25:36
You can think of a token as a white label alt coin on the bitcoin blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:54:58
yep working with the team, mainly as a UI designer but with some coding.
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:05:20
no this sounds like a different reason, what device are you using and how are you connecting to the internet? 3g? wifi?
@_date: 2016-05-23 06:21:35
I believe they do plan to make some physical version at some point
@_date: 2015-11-06 04:53:14


I understand your concern but most of these games (as with sarutobi) use off chain transactions, they team up with coinbase of xapo etc in return for users they supply the bitcoin for the game
@_date: 2016-05-11 14:56:09
no it will be available for older versions of android as well
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:51:49
yes thats correct, one address for all your tokens.
@_date: 2016-05-20 08:42:24
I'm not sure that Bitcoin its self will be used in gaming, it may, but imagine some sort of protocol built on top of bitcoin or another cryptonetwork may be used.
Having said that if more and more ecommerce moves to the gaming world bitcoin may be the currency of choice.
@_date: 2015-02-09 10:14:30
No worries, I am sending the update to apple now, could take a few days for it to go through
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:39:36
true the first app was developed in native iOS so it took time to learn the skills for Android
@_date: 2016-05-07 17:10:36
Tokens can also be use in games as transferable game items
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:31:34
Hey, I'm one of the devs, and yes that will be more intuitive in the next version coming soon
@_date: 2015-10-21 16:13:28


seems like the button is off the screen
 I will contact the other devs and get a fix into the next build
@_date: 2016-05-17 06:33:41
I think Symbiont is the company name and counterparty is the name of the technology they developed
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:54:02
We have actually already integrated shapeshift in the app, it is coming in the next update ;-) it works very well, and offers a seamless experience as the app can deposit tokens directly, great job at shapeshift!
@_date: 2015-10-05 00:34:58
I dont think you always can, it depends on how the mnemonic was implemented.
I have had a few apps which generated a phrase that could not be used to restore a wallet on other apps, 
this doesnt mean that the keys were stored on their server it just means the seedphrase recovery option was implemented slightly differently.  
i.e. different word lists, entropy levels etc
@_date: 2016-05-20 11:45:59
feedback? can you elaborate more?
@_date: 2015-02-09 08:58:29
yeah your probably right, it's just that the last version got abused by people with jailbroken phones, but I agree I hate to penalise legit players
@_date: 2016-05-09 01:25:37
Maybe the government can try giving everybody a rebate in bitcoin lol
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:06:02
Yeah, I was luck enough to be approached by Xapo and Genesis Mining,
I would try and reach out to some Bitcoin startups/companies and ask if they would help fund the pot for ad space in return etc
Or if you have the funds you could buy your own cloud miner to point to the app
anyway best of luck!
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:25:33
That would be this gentleman  its a Creative Commons song so is probably in a few other games
As for SaruTobi coin, try not to think of it as a secure investment, true if SaruTobi doesnt become a mainstream hit I imagine that SaruTobi coin will have more value.
So the price in IndieSquare is based on the counterparty exchange, if somebody buys 1 Sarutobi coin for $5, it displays the market price as $5.
The idea behind SaruTobi coin is
1. A reward point, holders of sarutobi coins will get extras in game and also in the future as new features are added
2. As I mentioned before if SaruTobi goes mainstream then early adopters will be rewarded by the increase in value.
@_date: 2016-05-20 10:16:16
currently in development, I can't give an ETA but hoping for the summer
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:34:24
I'm looking forward to using counterparty to "gamify" bitcoin more
@_date: 2015-02-09 09:42:05
I hear ya, but I just want more tips for players, hopefully soon a player will be able to earn dollars not just cents
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:14:43
To be fair with Apple this time, they were quite understanding I was afraid they would remove the app completely but that doesn't seem to be the case
@_date: 2015-03-20 13:19:24
Thanks I think I have found the issue,
The in app purchase may not work because the app has been removed from the app store,
as for the sold out, take a look now, seems the api Ive been using had changed  ;-)
@_date: 2015-03-19 03:08:46
Yes I had to remove it from China, and rate it 17+
I was confused as I thought I would have to remove it from Russia rather than China
Interesting, SaruTobi isn't gambling as the app is free and the user doesn't have to pay money to get Bitcoin, it is purely a tip.
Im not sure how your game functions but if the Bitcoin is guaranteed to the user, or they can purchase it maybe thats why they are more strict.
@_date: 2015-02-18 07:48:47
It is defiantly planned, however Im just a single dev at the moment so maintaining it for iOS is work enough
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:55:33
you cant at the moment but HD wallets are coming in a future update
@_date: 2015-02-19 03:40:47
Your welcome, my aim is to just help the Bitcoin community grow in whatever small way I can
@_date: 2015-02-23 01:00:10
Yes I agree, randomness is akin to skinner box technique,
I'll see how it goes, I can make it between 100 - 200 bits but i'm concerned the pot may be drained too quickly.
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:34:47
awesome, yeah im not sure why but I reckon the last three were below 100 bits?, there may be an issue sending too small an amount to a non xapo account.
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:52:44
Tried that but they had scripts to randomly generate different ip addresses 
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:54:37
Thank you for your feedback
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:56:34
The transactions are pending for some reason, sometimes they go through instantly some times they dont, I need to check with Xapo
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2016-05-20 04:37:30
yes there was bug but an update has been submitted and should be live soon
@_date: 2016-05-20 09:42:11
assuming the increase in scarcity reduce demand than I guess it's good for people who hold bitcoin
@_date: 2015-02-09 08:25:59
$1.50 for the pot which goes to players in tips ;-)
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:09:39
Thanks for the tip, hoping to get it out in the next couple of weeks. Users who choose to sign up for Xapo will get slightly more in tips though as Xapo are helping to fund the pot.
@_date: 2016-05-11 14:56:52
Yes you will be able to earn monthly bitcoin payouts and also sometimes be able to get instant bitcoin tips
@_date: 2016-05-11 08:11:55
Android ver will be slightly different so even people who have played the iOS ver can enjoy the android version ;-)
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:14:12
Hi, should be instantly,
just want to confirm, buy sending tips you mean you collected the black coins and bought a tip in the store?
@_date: 2015-02-09 09:42:49
Part of the reason we are teaming up with Xapo, if the app is popular due to their promotion I can get enough funds to build for other devices
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:24:01
So it reached your address ok?
@_date: 2016-05-07 16:29:57
one thing with bitcoin is that its hard to get adoption in countries such as Japan as a currency, its not that attractive.
But tokens allow a sense of expression and customibility.
Theres talk of famous Japanese idols creating their own tokens on the bitcoin blockchain to distribute among fans etc 
 
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:54:20
Thank you for your feedback
@_date: 2016-05-20 04:37:50
 there was bug with the banana counting, but an update has been submitted and should be live soon
@_date: 2015-02-10 03:36:11
A stupid one wont be able to get past the other security traps, but I guess we will find out.
@_date: 2015-10-21 17:15:39
if your eager to make your own token check out counterparty.io, you can make it there as well ;-)
@_date: 2016-05-12 01:22:31
Yes I have big hopes for tokenized game assets, imagine if a popular game such as SoG has tokenized game objects, then other games who want to attract SoG players can just (without permission) user the SoG items in their game. So now instead of copy cat games springing up you will get games that use the same items.
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:55:46
Im not sure, but I always saw the playstore as less strict than the app store so good luck
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:31:07
I can't apologise enough
All I can say is that all the address included in the newsletter were added by legitimate players who downloaded the app entered their email and played the game enough to collect 12 black coins to get a tip.
All address have been removed from the mailing list now
The app is non profit so all money made goes back into tip donations.
@_date: 2015-02-26 03:39:46
Indeed it does ;-)
@_date: 2016-05-19 04:29:50
sorry for the delay!
@_date: 2015-10-21 04:11:17
We are based in Tokyo, and yes members of the team do participate in events
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:57:06
Hi Sorry for the late response i'm not really a reddit user.
Thanks peilthetraveler as kinoshitajona for your support.
Yes I was well aware that hackers would try and abuse the pot, the first version was really just a test to see if Apple would approve such an app and also what vulnerabilities iOS apps can have security wise.
2.0 is now out and has added security. Im not saying it is perfect but we are constantly working on improving it and have been in contact with security experts.
You may have noticed the latest version uses Xapo, and the user has to verify an email address and cell phone to collect their tips. I think this alone goes a long way to stop bots and also makes it more usable for newcomers to Bitcoin (as they would be confused by the wallet address system).
I feel bad for users who donated and may have had some bitcoin compromised but for the small amount of bitcoin that was stolen I put it back in from my pocket.
It is important to say that due to various time restrictions a hacker can't really steal that much that fast and to be honest it's not a profitable hack.
Regardless we have a few partnerships with Bitcoin companies in the future in return for pot donations so individual users will not need to donate.
Also a lot of users have requested I make the app open source, well I did a lot of work to try and make the app very very difficult to decompile to deter hackers, so making it open source would make that pointless.
I am just an indie dev and SaruTobi was my small part to try and introduce Bitcoin to more people. I hope you enjoy the app and the future apps I have planned
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:52:25
Yeah I hear you, im sure all companies have their issues, but to be fair to Xapo they were cool about me letting users use wallet address, even though it wasnt part of the original partnership
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:08:59
We are are looking to create and android version in the future, please support us on [patreon]( to help speed the process up!
@_date: 2015-02-23 12:51:18
Good to hear ;-)
@_date: 2015-02-13 13:09:29
Good news, We are working on a version that will allow you to use your bitcoin address as well as your xapo account. 
However you will need to enter a captcha each time you get your tip
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:53:46
I believe it is in the early access program so some people will have the card before the public release
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:44:26
Thank you for understanding, there was no pressure from genesis mining it was a complete blunder on my part.
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:30:41
there is a dust 100 bits payout, but there is also a monthly payout
so the ad revenue at the end of the month is paid back to the players, so people may get a usable $10
@_date: 2016-07-31 09:01:42
If you are interested please contact contact
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:51:58
Thanks, but I think they are correct jail brake detection is not going to deter a good hacker, plus there are other security features in place
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:46:35
Thank you for understanding, there was no pressure from genesis mining or Xapo it was a complete blunder on my part.
I shall be remembursing those effected with larger tips
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:10:03
Can you try again and let me know if it comes through this time
@_date: 2015-02-09 11:58:35


Thanks, thats very generous of you.
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:09:58
Can you try again and let me know if it comes through this time
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:21:29
agreed, but potential marketers may want to drop bitcoin to do treasure hunts, or advertising
@_date: 2016-05-19 04:22:29
it is not a multiplier it just means extra so plus 44, your right it is a bit confusing
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:22:36
oh yeah, my macbook pro died so had to install on my alienware via hackintosh
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:15:16
thanks, but I can say i've had no issues with Xapo and am grateful they are helping donate to the app
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:28:32
The pot is full again, and we have a cloud miner hooked up that will donate daily. Thank you genesis-mining.com
At the moment you need to enter and email in the app and sign up for Xapo to get tips, but in the next update the use of wallet addresses will be reintegrated
@_date: 2018-12-22 18:36:12
cool, you can tweet to  what was the error?
@_date: 2016-07-07 07:10:15
After the HODOR door episode of game of thrones, somebody meant to write "I'm Holding bitcoin" but they accidentally wrote "I'm Hodling bitcoin"
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:20:55
yes, it only grabs the wallet address from breadwallet, but you can enter any other address for payouts
@_date: 2016-07-31 09:26:00
The app should remove coins if they are claimed, and users should need to go to the location to collect the coins, have you seen other such behaviour?
@_date: 2016-07-31 02:45:00
hoping september
@_date: 2015-10-20 16:01:44
it would say its on our roadmap but no immediate plans just yet, we are interested in refining the app from community feedback first
@_date: 2015-02-13 13:09:22
Good news, We are working on a version that will allow you to use your bitcoin address as well as your xapo account. 
However you will need to enter a captcha each time you get your tip
@_date: 2015-02-18 07:55:00
That has already happened thanks to genesis-mining.com!, about 0.09 btc is added daily
@_date: 2015-02-18 07:48:00
Yes thats correct, hoping it wont stop too many humans though
@_date: 2016-07-31 11:08:30
How'd did you try and pick them If they are all over? All over the city? Or world? Did you spoof your location?
@_date: 2018-12-23 04:57:22










I let the guys know about your issue anyway thanks
@_date: 2015-02-09 08:30:58
Hi all
I understand some of you are annoyed with the Xapo integration but this was done for the following reasons
1. Xapo donate to the pot, The app doesnt really make a profit, I think apple paid me $5 in ad revenue since the app was launched Xapo were offering to help keep the pot full, as it ran out and people werent donating and whats the point in having an app that tips you in Bitcoin if theres not Bitcoin to tip?
2. Xapo lets you just enter an email, for new users entering a Bitcoin wallet address was too confusing and I think in the future wallet address wont be used.
3. Security, having to verify your email address stops bots from abusing the pot
If it wasnt Xapo it would have been another wallet provider.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:42:17
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:22:15
GSP spoofing is a serious problem, which is why we now enforce users adding question to bitcoin they drop
@_date: 2018-12-23 05:22:25
So the wallet doesnt support recovery lol, its seems to try and be insanely simple, so just make a new wallet and get another channel in the game for now I think, you can unlink/reset the channel in the game
@_date: 2016-07-31 09:03:29
Hi, I never received an email from you, but please contact contact
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:55:47
I heard about privacy concerns with Peach or is that FUD?
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:43:58
all the tips will be 100 bits now, so don't worry about it, I have to hear from Xapo to confirm if thats the case.
Thanks again for your help
@_date: 2016-07-31 02:03:42
android is in development 
@_date: 2016-07-07 23:12:18
ah I see, the HODOR episode must have revitalized the term 
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:07:35
Thats not entirely true, you can get up to 8000 satoshi with a wallet, the amounts are random, but Xapo account will give you up to 10000 though
@_date: 2016-07-31 09:44:57
Thanks, when you refreshed did they not disappear?
Where were these takara?
@_date: 2016-07-31 11:30:24
Interesting, yes the app tells user to add a question
I am the dev, may I ask how what you used to spoof? So all takara  you tried to pick up by spoofing said they had already been picked up?
Can you please send me an email to contact I'd love to find out more
@_date: 2016-07-20 11:25:13
one way to mitigate this is to drop bitcoin in places and secure the bitcoin with a question/answer, 
for example you drop in a cafe and the question is "what is the wifi password?"
but this does limit the places you could drop
end there is the chance that somebody could find out the answer via other means
@_date: 2016-07-12 03:22:20
These games are coming, Spells of Genesis for example
There are also companies building bitcoin/blockchain gaming SDKs for developers to make it that much easier to create bitcoin games.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:41:36
I promise? but yeah if you dont trust me dont donate too much but thanks, fyi check out my twitter  to see my history, hopefully makes me more trustworthy
@_date: 2018-12-23 04:52:47
Thanks, im not the dev on the wallet the guys at hashhub are so best contact them :-)
@_date: 2016-07-31 11:43:03
Thank you :-)
@_date: 2016-07-31 09:24:26
So you tried to collect a takara and it reported it was already claimed? Where was this takara if it was claimed it should not appear on the map
@_date: 2019-05-02 06:47:24
I think this is just strange english by Japanese, I think they want to say that it uses mainnet not just testnet not that mainnet is their specific feature lol
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:42:29
Why would you want to do this?
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:42:10
yeah maybe afterwards, something I want to look into! but apple are restrictive
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:55:48
The transactions are pending for some reason, sometimes they go through instantly some times they dont, I need to check with Xapo
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2019-05-01 11:33:56
oh yeah but is Bitfurys peach live though? its open source guess it can be havent heard of anyone using it though
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:22:25
Android is in development 
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:52:14
what do you mean by platform?
