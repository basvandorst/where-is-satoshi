Denmark has no plans to abolish cash. Where do you have that source from? Denmark has decided to stop printing its own bills in the country and will instead have it made cheaper somewhere else. But there are no plans to stop having cash.

That artcile is not saying we are planning to abolish cash. The article mention that retailers required to take cash. That is true. Many gas stationers and 7-11 stores and its like. Are being allowed to not take cash currency in the late hours of the day as in bills and coins due to robbery. However they will be required to take visa, dankort (danish visa-like card) in our own currency. There are no plans to go away from the danish currency.

That receipt.. Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh, my God. It even has a bitcoin discount line.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:12:08
The seller can give any kind of discount they want on their price. Its not related to the payment fee. Here they just decided to take 10% off if you pay with bitcoin
