For everyone in the thread who has had someone to say about the murder for hire aspect.
I think you should do a google search of him. There is a reason why the murder charges against him have been dropped. He never attempted to kill someone in the first place. Its an FBI tactic to slander someone in the media to persuade public opinion in certain directions. Seriously google.
    The allegations against Ulbricht include a variety of conspiracies including narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering, as well as planned acts of violence. However, the murder-for-hire charges were dropped as part of the formal charges.
    According to a family member who attended the arraignment: "Murder-for-Hire, the most sensationalist and damning allegation of the government, was NOT a formal charge in the arraignment.

I have no investment in bitcoin despite what my name suggests. I bought 1 bitcoin at $600 and sold it at $1100 several months ago. Thats the extent of my knowledge. I dont know if you're right or wrong, just noticed that you come off as a dick with the way you seem to belittle others.
Get off your horse man.

You people are parasites. Not a single one of you is going to "share the wealth", just add to your hoarded bitcoin collection. Plebs.
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:19:20
This isnt true. Stop spreading misinformation.

Impossible for a bitcoin to ever have that much value. If that was the case, bitcoin would be one of the strongest currencies on earth, and be worth more than most countries GPD.
Somewhere in the 5-10k range, is not outrageous by any means though.

I wouldnt doubt it had something to do with the bank I use, as it has a less than poor reputation. How could I remedy this? Are you suggesting, they are just not letting the deposits show on my statement because of its connection to bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:15:02
Damn, every single comment is sarcastic and negative as fuck. Im so proud of you magnificent bastards.
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:22:00
watch out guys, we gots us a badass over here.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:44:35
I dabble in r/trees responsibly good sir, and I researched bitcoins all by myself. 
Dont make me tip you for that sarcastic comment.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:17:49
Don't be a passive aggressive nanny, just message her directly the price of bitcoins with the message big mistake.

Honestly, this just made me burst out laughing in class.
I hate those idiots on BTC-E.
BTC taking off to the moon!!! buy now!!
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:06:24
As someone who missed his chance to buy at 800 a piece i am loving this. I will buy all day at that price. I expect bitcoins to be worth 2,000 a piece by the end of January.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:17:04
I dont think there is any "pop" coming anytime soon. In the future I can see bitcoin being a service used by ebay, amazon and other huge online marketplaces. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:57:07
We need another gif when each bitcoin is worth 100k.

From countless hours, spent researching over at r/silkroad and on the silkroad 2's actual forums on TOR. Its being speculated by a lot of people on silkroad that ross spilled his guts.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:14:55
Thank you man. I appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:02:55
Someones mad they didnt invest when they were $100 a piece.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:19:00
This is actually a good idea. I might have to do that on some seperate flyers. Maybe create like 15-20 wallets with $1-5 worth of bitcoins. Thanks for the idea.
And Im not honestly looking for anyone to even use the QR code. Just using it as a way to showcase how easy it is to send money through bitcoin.

money spam is the best kind of spam

Since I have 60% of my capital invested in Bitcoins, I care a whole lot that it succeeds. No need for unkind words friend, if you dont like my thread, click the downvote button.
Have a nice day.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:07:38
I made these flyers last night. Only was able to put up 5 in my community before it got dark. Tomorrow I plan on hitting up some local walking trails, and businesses and asking if I could hang my flyer outside their store. This is an exciting time for us.
We must band together to make bitcoin more visable! For this to really succeed, people need to learn about Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:05:32
You cant mine anymore. The algorithm is now so intense, that people have created million dollar super labs to mine coins.
Your computer cant mine nothing but dust man.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:27:33
I agree, it makes sense to have a small dip after black friday. 
The price is going to start picking up again come Monday.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:18:45
Im pretty sure legally those bitcoins no longer belong to you.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:48:02
Now I just need to figure out how to give someone a bitcoin tip and Im ready to spread the word of bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:08:55
Your best interest to sell will be December 23, 2016. That day bitcoin will be worth 1million a piece, and you will finally be able to afford that hooker to take your virginity OP!
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:25:20
I have a set strategy. It was only 600 bucks. I wont panic sell no matter what. If bitcoin crashes I lose 600, but if it becomes integrated into society, I stand to gain so much.
Never panic sell!
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:28:00
What you basically just asked us is, "hey, does anyone know anyone on here that is giving away free money?"
Really, what do you think the answer to your question is?
Think real hard.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:54:00
Can someone explain everything to me so I dont have to do any work!
Thats pretty much all I took out of your post.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:48:39
No one is going to give you free money here.
Bitcointips are earned around here the hard way.
By being a sarcastic asshat to someone else.
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:41:41
He is not trying to deny anything anymore. He made a plea deal with the FBI, and gave out major players in the moderation of silk road 2.0. 
If he is trying to get his bitcoins back, that means to me at least, that he wont be looking at life in prison because of the plea deal.
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:59:37
$1700 by christmas
$1450 on New Years
$1500 the very next day
If these numbers are accurate, I want a damn bitcoin tip.
Im saving this thread.

What alt coins are you into?
From what Ive seen, there is some merit to peercoin, litecoin, and namecoin.
