Money and banks don't build houses. Labour and resources build houses. Money is a vehicle of value used to reward people for their labour. Money can still exist without banks. 
For the most part, a lot of what bankers do can be replaced by code and government policy. Combine that with the possible transparency and immutability of a public ledger and you'll get a system that's really, really fucking hard to cheat and corrupt. Now everyone that works in a bank can get a job that creates tangible value. The society that would breed form that would have a more level playing ground for achieving equality of potential
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:06:25
But that doesn't change the fact that banks are parasitic institutions. What argument are you trying to make? If I was on the fence before reading your comments, I'd now be well on the side of crypto just so I didn't have to associate with your opinions.
Also, fiat and deflation aren't two ends of the same stick, so I don't know why you're comparing them either. You can have an inflationary currency that's not fiat and that is a decentralized crypto. Did you know that?

Mother of Christ. Where do I start?
So I don't know what the name of the fallacy is that you're applying, but it's there. But let's start elsewhere. 
North Korea isn't going through he issues it's going through because of poor financial institutions. Of you don't remember, or if you don't know, North Korea has been an explicit dictatorship for a while now. During that time they've had tighter sanctions placed on them by leading Western countries. This has made it incredibly difficult for North Korea to be economically progressive. Not because they don't have a core banking institution. 
Comparing North Korea and Africa makes no sense either. One's a country run by a dictator, the other a continent with many, many core banking institutions throughout. 
A lot of the problems on Africa hail from powerful parties trying to acquire resources throughout the area. There are many mineral and metal in areas throughout the continent. A by-product of this in a continent where Law&amp;Order has trouble establishing itself is the forming or rebel insurgents in many different countries, groups that try to control access to and from mineral and metal rich areas. This makes it very, very fucking difficult for Africa to get itself off the ground.

Mate, banks don't create technology. Labour and resources create technology. Through labour and resources we got to crypto. So crypto absolutely could have existed without banks.
Every Son should better their Father. So let crypto through without repression. It'll grow all the better for it.
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:36:07
Nah mate, banks and corporations influence governments. Governments then enact their will. Removing the institutions that decide their policy implementation will lead to better governments. 
A government \(ran well\) is like an extended family. Everyone pulls their weight and is duly rewarded for it by the value they create within their home nation\-state.
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:17:01
I take it you're a neoliberal?
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:26:04
Yes it is. Decentralized tokens of value that aren't issued or controlled from a central authority is clearly better. It takes away a lot of the labour from financial institutions and the labour that's left over has less, if any, of an effect on the flow and control of that token of value. The labour that's removed from financial institutions could be placed in positions of medical or scientific research, essential public services etc.
But your retort misses the point completely. We're a slave to the fiat system because their is no alternative. If you create value you are legally obliged to participate in the fiat system. Removing this barrier means people will be able to more freely create value and, therefore, more valuable things can be created.
What is the "crypto system" by the way? I'm sure you know seeing as you referenced it, but I'd like for you to elaborate. Maybe you'll convince me yet.
Also, your response assumes that assuming is bad. You literally null\-and\-voided your own argument with that statement. Maybe not being able to master your language isn't a big deal to you, but the limits of your language are the limits of your mind, and clearly you are quite limited. \(Are they paying well per chance?\)
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:11:13
You're probably right. But why are you supporting banks if that's the case? Why do you work so hard to defend them if you know that they are going to leverage any innovation to steal value?
Anyway, who knows what the future holds. I seriously doubt that banks in their current form will remain forever. Only change remains
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:09:32
No, the government is not the problem. Like banking, governance is a great idea implemented properly. Neoliberal policies are damaging, not only to the citizens of the country it espouses from, but globally. The fact that banks and corporations can effect the policies of a government is an issue. Governments should instead work to protect the citizens from nefarious corporations and institutions.

Just as a son replaces his Father and betters him, cryptocurrencies will replace fiat (electronic or otherwise). 
No child should have to admire the sins of his Father.
Also, assuming banks and businesses create technology is incredibly short sighted. Labour and resources create technology. If people can harness resources and create technology through their labour without banks, then it's entirely possible we would have devised an electronic vehicle of value and medium of exchange without banks. You could absolutely have one without the other. Your claim otherwise is baseless.

@_date: 2018-05-14 04:24:59
The concept of banking should empower people financially across the globe, but it's not enacted with compassion or equality, so the practical situation is one where BILLIONS of people are unbanked or underbanked. 
In fact, taken a step further, the reality is that those who work is powerful positions in banks are self-interested. Having self-interested individuals run powerful institutions that pull the geopolitical strings of our age is dangerous.
I'm interested on what your metric is for defining the best or worst countries. 
Countries with a high quality of life have such because of economic freedom, not banking. Equating the two is a flaw. 
Now don't get me wrong, I think banks can be wonderful institutions. They're important. But I'd be a proponent of public banking. I don't think banks should make a profit for managing the currency flow or holding the funds of individuals. Such services are so integral to economic freedom, and therefore to the overall quality of life, in a given nation state that I think it's in the interest of the state to provide those services through taxes that are paid. Loans should still incur interest, the total of which could be put back in to state spending. 
But I think you're missing the bigger point. The advent of cryptocurrencies has opened up a dialogue that many people would have never even considered. Can we separate tokens of value from the state in which they're exchanged? Can we force oligarchial financial institutions to provide a fairer and more transparent service by scaring them into action? Can we create a system whereby people can create value without being charged for it? Yes we can. We can with decentralized tokens of value that rely on a transparent, secure and immutable ledger to broadcast activity.

If banking and Bitcoin aren't the same thing then why do you keep comparing them?
Check out the rate of stores accepting Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. It's exponential
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:53:44
No, Bitcoin doesn't allow you to be your own bank. When people say that, what they mean is that when you have Bitcoins in your wallet \(a wallet you have access to the private keys of\) that you are in full control of what's in that wallet. Whereas when you have money in a bank, it's entirely feasible that the bank will put a limit on what you can withdraw.

@_date: 2018-05-14 15:49:30
That's true. Most credit is created within banking institutions when they lend. Which is the problem.
We're forced to participate in the fiat system. Banks, private banks, get to create money and soak up the interest. I think that would be a job best left to the state through a cryptocurrency with a public ledger. Now interest from loans can be directly invested into the state \(roads, hospitals, schools, services etc\). So the more people that take out loans and spend it within a given economy, the more people from that economy will benefit from from that spending, more so than they/we do today. 
Although, approaching what was said by GeorgePantsMcG, do you think a lot of services that we rely on can be provided by smart contracts?
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:00:32
It's not a fact. A fact can be backed up unequivocally. Having to say "it's just a fact" over and over is an unfortunate intellectual shortcoming on your part. 
Perhaps you can provide unbiased studies into the the effects of a bank at a micro and macro level? Can you provide any evidence that banks moving into new territory is the biggest driver of prosperity? (You definitely can't without a strong metric anyways, which doesn't exist) Do you maybe want to address other areas of my last comment to you aswel?
A bank called Anglo-Irish was, by far, undoubtedly, the biggest factor of the recession that was faced by the Irish people in 2008. It's been documented better than any other financial happening in the country. More accurately, it was the (self-interested) individuals who run the banks that fucked shit up. 
Sooooooo, you're wrong.

At least your pride is okay, even if the community gets weaker, right?Maybe bear the responsibility properly. That's sure to work better than what you've done so far.

I know from working with many businesses that they don't like do harm profits in one area by having another area eat them up. So I wouldn't even call it a conspiracy if it was true. I'd just call it diligent business. 
Imagine setting up a business and not seeking to maximise your profits? At the end of the day, if I was to speak my mind, I'd say any company controlling the progress of Bitcoin is very nefarious. It was, by nature, supposed to be for the people, by the people. That it's tied in to a large company does *implicitly* remove that decentralized aspect.
Let me say, I'm not a fan of Bitcoin Cash. I've never owned any. I shorted it once, then got scared, so closed it at market real quick. 
Do you think in the future there'll be other methods of speeding up blockchain transactions in the future that'll far outweigh the benefits of sidechains? When I say future I mean in the next ten years.
Also, is it feasible for Bitcoin to adopt different methods for processing transactions that are cheaper and faster than legacy, BCH and the planned sidechains?

Hello! Thank you for not being a knob. That's always nice.
Okay, I won't pretend that I know the technical aspects that well. That's probably the biggest reason why I had to ask. That said, you're only going to get it to me if you can explain it well.
Anyway, what's the story with the fees on the sidechains? Are they given to the miners on the main Bitcoin network, or are they harvested by Blockstream?
Ehm... saying that Bitcoin cannot be threatened by governments or companies is kinda naive. I understand from what angle you're taking this, but it's not where I'm coming from. The decentralized aspect of Bitcoin can be threatened in many ways, from someone/group having too much hashing power, holding a disproportionately large amount of tokens or selling a disproportionately large amount of tokens at market. While Blockstream are obviously unable to do this, do you think them hiring/providing many of the developers for the Bitcoin Core team introduces a conflict of interest when they're creating sidechains? That they can almost regulate the progress of legacy Bitcoin. It's kinda like having the Governor of a huge bank sitting as president of the FSB.... the success of one could detriment the success of another, no?
As for the last question, let me get back to you.

I'll definitely give it a read. That was just a cheeky fish for a TL;DR. 
Okay, no sidechains. So there's been no discussion as to how expensive it would be to transact on the sidechains that aren't yet in production.
Okay, so 1/1000th a satoshi goes to the people running nodes. (Can I run a node per chance?) But no fees in the LN are shared with any users of legacy Bitcoin network?
The most unfeasible require cooperation of what you feel are mortal enemies, but the reality is different. One group of resource-rich friends could absolutely own enough Bitcoin to essentially centralize Bitcoin. I don't think that's debatable. More to the point, that's not the discussion I came for. 
Yes, I am (like a lot in the crypto community) absolutely under the impression that developers can direct and redirect the direction of the project, especially it's development, especially developers hired/provided by Blockstream. There would only need to be some light collusion between those two parties for an agenda to be executed. With that, I certainly can't think they're too few in ideas. 
The conflict of interest I see is in order for Blockstream to make profit, Bitcoin cannot function that well. Said another way, if legacy Bitcoin functions too well, there'll be no need for the sidechains that Blockstream want to introduce and, therefore, no profits for Blockstream. There's no way a business wants to run and not make profits. They solidified that by deciding to rush ahead with sidechains and not even playing with the ideal increasing block size for the short term.
Can you explain economically how the success of one guarantees the success of another without one being a parasite unto the other? How would LN make money without Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-14 08:12:11
That's not a good answer. Is it definitely untrue that Blockstream have not bought the r/Bitcoin thread?

As an example, in Birmingham in 1974 a bomb went off at a local pub killing 21 people and injuring 182 others. Six lads from Ireland were arrested and accused of being in the provisional IRA. They were sentenced to life in prison. 16 years later their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal. At that stage one of the men had died in prison and everyone else was mentally fucked from the psychological trauma of how they came to be arrested and how they were treated in prison. It was, and still is, a fucking disgrace. 
By your logic: there were only six people caught, six who got arrested and six who were tried. Are you genuinely retarded? You fuckboi.
Oh my God I only read the second and third paragraphs of your reply now. Jesus wept. It's too late for you. I can't make sense of the word salad you tossed up in the second paragraph, but I'll try tackle the third one. 
I know you don't care. I can tell by your amateur, spoon-fed opinions. You like the intellegence agencies in your country? Do you know them intimately? Are you not an active caring citizen who challenges breaches of privacy and justice? Do you care if your children are brought up in a world where your intellegence agencies can freely exact their wrath on its citizens? 
"None of those people would be my friends". Ba-hahahahahahahahaha!! You are priceless! I'm screenshotting that!
Look at this big thinker: "it was called silk road something something". It actually gets better though...
"... FBI agent basically narrates the whole story... ". Doubt there s any bias there mate. 
And you see, stupid boi, I'm not asking you to trust me. I'm asling you to trust yourself. DYOR or refrain from uneducated opinions perhaps? Instead of perpetuating tripe that most media outlets feed you, maybe try find something out for yourself by checking as many sources as possible and folding it into a coherent story? Then you'll be a good boi.
Who's a good boi? Ah-ah! No! Bold! I said you have to think for yourself! Bold boi!

No, DPR tried to have someone killed. That administrators account was most likely manned by multiple people. 
So saying Ross tried to have someone killed is a bit of a stretch. 
Can the FBI produce evidence?

Also, are you sure it was his defence that said that?
"Department of Homeland Security agent Jared Deryeghiayan revealed that he had at one point suspected Mark Karpeles, the CEO of Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, of being behind the online drugs marketplace..."

I mean, I don't conduct covert operations to snag a guy who's part of running an online drug bazaar, so I don't know what their other options are. But I suppose we should jist take their word for it, no? (The FBI that is)
   
They're, like, so trustworthy. 
They haven't even provided the 'how' of how did they find out. 
Let's be honest, many countries have many times pinned shit on people just so they can say they closed the case. But that's not justice. So maybe we should open our dialogue to more than just, "Derp (sic), taking his word for it". Unless you don't really give a shit about concepts like justice, privacy and freedom of course. Then you may aswel allow yourself to be cuckolded by your nations intelligence agency. They'd probably use their freedom better than you'd use yours.

I mean, did you read the sources I provided? That's why you should think someone else was involved. 
And it's actually the intelligence agency that brought the case forward and presented it as it was. It's a moot point to say that the judicial system convicted him. Obviously they did. That's how it works. But they didn't create and present the case as it was. That was the FBI.
Saying "I watched a documentary" is like saying "I was too high to read anything". Nah, that's a lol. But really though, you're never going to learn much by watching a documentary. They're made for confirmation biases. Incredibly difficult to get an objective idea about something through a documentary. Could you link me this documentary too so that I can slate it in detail? 
And yes, if you were a jury member, based on the case the FBI presented against him, you wouldn't have much reasonable doubt that he was involved. But you would definitely have reasonable doubt to assume that he done EVERYTHING that DPR done. (Unless the facts of the case were manipulated to pin everything on him of course, but that's none of my business...) (Hey Kermit, pour me a tea)
Yiure basically saying, "the FBI said it so it is". You've done nothing to check the plethora of facts that exists around the case. You've just listened to your intellegence agency. Which is corrupt. Your intelligence agency that is.

There was something else I was reading about a 'signature' that's present in the way people write, and I think there are three distinct signatures within the multiple posts made by DPR. 
Some Irish guy also got arrested there last year for being an administrator of Silk Road I think? Could be completely wrong about that though amigo. 
I'm not saying he didn't make the call to have a few people killed. I'm saying that the FBI pinned everything that DPR done on to him.

Is this not a good argument for why Bitcoin will succeed? Those who are involved with and champion Bitcoin are in a global minority compared to those who actively disbelieve that it will ever amount to anything worthwhile. 
A lot of "experts" and high-profile characters have said that 1) Bitcoin won't last, 2) it's not really money, 3) it has no intrinsic value, 4) it's too slow and 5) it uses too much electricity.
1) A vapid statement when presented on it's own, but usually given in conjunction with many or all of the others listed...
2) I love this one because it opens dialogue for what money is and what purpose it's meant to serve and that's the most dangerous thing that can happen to the established financial elite
3) After understanding the meaninglessness of the second point, this point becomes as frustrating as it is funny
4) This will change
5) And so will this
Perhaps in fifty years BTC will be added to this infographic
