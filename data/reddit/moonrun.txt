Optimistic expectations are priced in. This is why bad rumors (the latest china rumor) can have a negative effect on the price, while good news, no matter how big they are (like Microsoft news) have almost no effect on the price.
The reason is simple, those who believe in crypto already own it.
Most people have no incentive to use crypto (they need to convert money to use it). Also many people who hear about crypto think that it is essentially a pyramid scheme.
What about the underbanked or the unbanked, are they going to use bitcoin? 
If the coin won't become mainstream in developed countries, then it will remain volatile (adoption reduces volatility). The unbanked and underbanked won't have an incentive to use a volatile currency that is not trusted by people in developed countries.
Bitcoin also has stigma attached to it that might soon create a domino effect where merchants and charities will not want to associate their brand name with bitcoin.
"Seven cents doesn’t sound like much. However, at scale, it adds up. Our donation form will get roughly two million more visitors before the campaign concludes on December 31st — which means adding “Donate with Bitcoin” would reduce income by about $140,000 – a significant amount."
The price of bitcoin might continue to decline because of high inflation rate in the next two years. To counter inflation many new users have to enter the space, but as concluded before, people don't have any incentive to do so.
Bitcoin exists for 6 years, in 6 years facebook already had hundred of millions of users (torrents also have millions of users), unlike pre internet days, people are tech savvy today, so the comparison to the internet (that is used to explain slow adoption rate) is misleading.

Bitcoin supposed to be a currency. If it is, as you say, a lottery ticket, where is the incentive to spend it? It's irrational to spend something you think has the potential to make you rich.

There is a threshold of stability that particular cryptocurrency must past in order to be considered as a valuable currency, this threshold creates the scarcity needed for currencies to function properly. The monopoly of one blockchain creates scarcity but it is also unsustainable for the reasons I've mentioned before.

Will you pay for coffee with this lottery ticket? 
The question is, if bitcoin is treated like a lottery ticket and there is no incentive to spend it, to use it as a currency, then it means that bitcoin is not a “functional currency”.
Here you can say, but bitcoin is also a "digital commodity" it is digital gold. Well, this “digital commodity” has to derive value from somewhere, right?
Supposedly it derives its value from being a currency, but as concluded before - bitcoin is not a “functional currency” and that means it has no value as a "digital commodity".
Now ask yourself, in what you're actually investing? If bitcoin is not a “functional currency” nor is it a “digital commodity”, what is it exactly?

It is strange. Even the expectation of financial institutions investing in the bitcoin ecosystem was priced in (like with Microsoft news).

What are your thoughts on promoting multiple blockchain solution in order to create a true decentralized ecosystem. 
Today you trust mining pools and ASIC manufactures not to attack the system. You also trust the early adopters not to dump their coins and destroy the bitcoin economy. This is not a true decentralized trustless reliable system.
Bitcoin is a monopoly and if it fails then for obvious reasons the cryptocurrency movement will suffer as a whole. We need multiple blockchains to be in balance with each other (in terms of market cap, network effect, security, merchants…).
 This is the only way we’ll have a strong and healthy crypto ecosystem that can scale.
This is a simple model how it should work: each individual currency (bitcoin, dogecoin, peercoin…) functions as a “node” in the crypto ecosystem, this way the crypto ecosystem becomes practically indestructible and a system that people can truly rely on.
The multiple blockchains system is the true decentralized trustless system. People who only invest in bitcoin and companies that only support bitcoin hurt cryptocurrency movement by creating a monopoly.
Cryptocurrency movement will have higher chances of survival if the majority of people involved in crypto today will realize that they should support multiple blockchains rather than just one.
It’s irrational to support only one because not only it reduces the chances of growth of your individual investment (putting all eggs in one basket) but also promotes the monopoly of one blockchain, which makes cryptocurrency movement weaker as a whole.
The "one blockchain/bitcoin is like the internet" analogy should be replaced with "multiple blockchains are like the internet” analogy.
There is a threshold of stability that particular cryptocurrency must past in order to be considered as a valuable currency, this threshold creates the scarcity needed for currencies to function properly. 
Thank you.

Bitcoin is centralized. So there is nothing that bitcoin can offer that can't be replicated by a different centralized system. All the computing power is wasted on "securing" a centralized system. You don't need bitcoin tokens to have a secure blockchain - don't believe the hype.

**Are you seriously comparing a system the enables early adopters to anonymously crush the economy completely from a laptop at anytime at a push of a button, to the system we have today?**
You must recognize the absurdity of promoting bitcoin as a valid alternative.
**Some anonymous early adopters can crush the bitcoin economy at the push of a button, this is a fact. Why should anyone promote bitcoin knowing that fact?**
 A lot of people here promote it as the the future of money, promote it as a foundation for the future global economy.
**It is irresponsible to promote this system, while knowing that some anonymous early adopters can crush it at the push of a button at any time.**
It is absolutely immoral to promote bitcoin, and you know it.
But hey, let's ignore reality.
@_date: 2015-03-08 03:23:06
Just because some people think that the current system is flawed doesn't mean that the alternative they promote is any better. In the case of bitcoin it is much much worse, as concluded earlier.  
By the way, most of those who promote bitcoin, don't do so out of the kindness of their hearts, but because they have all the incentives to ignore facts and manipulate information. Bitcoin is a get-rich-quick scheme for most of these "investors".

Bitcoin does not have strong network effect. Look at the numbers. There are very few active users, people who buy bitcoin mostly don't spend it. Bitcoin exists for 6 years, in internet time, bitcoin is a dinosaur. 
People should stop misleading others by comparing it to the internet adoption rate, people are more or less tech-savvy today,  hundreds of millions of people use torrents. There is no barrier to entry. People just don't see any reason to use bitcoin.
You don't need trillion dollars to compete with bitcoin, there is nothing to compete against. Bitcoin doesn't even offer decentralization, the mining is pretty much centralized.
**Money is already digital.** Bitcoin doesn't offer anything of value that other services, that use trusted currencies, with actual network effect, can't achieve. 
Digital currencies work, can they be better, probably, but the same thing can be said about comparing bitcoin to altcoins. 
When someone mentions that an altcoin with better tech might take over bitcoin, some people here are claiming that the first mover advantage and network effect will win, they compare it to the internet, that the internet could have been better. The protocol we use today won because it was **good enough**. 
Well digital currencies, with actual network effect, by the same logic, are good enough, they already won. 
The unbanked don't need bitcoin if it is too volatile. Volatility might be reduced if there will be more users from developed countries. But most people in those countries, as concluded before, have no reason what so ever to use bitcoin. 
This is why the unbanked would not adopt a volatile currency that is not trusted by the majority of people from developed countries. 
Well what about remittances? There are millions invested in services that will compete on the global remittances market using traditional currencies.
For example:
Anyway, forget about remittances, the unbanked and the first mover advantage. There is not much value bitcoin can offer to the world. It just wastes energy and pollutes the environment.

The reality is, that those few early adopters that accumulated an enormous amount of bitcoin can anonymously and at push of button crush the market.
This fact is verifiable by the endless pump and dumps that the crypto scene has gone through. To deny this is to deny reality.

No it's not. Surviving doesn't mean that the network is thriving. It is not about the survival of the bitcoin network. It is about economic stability.


I'm all for looking for different alternatives.

I don't really think most people wish to own a bank. The unbanked will use something centralized like m-pesa, as a mobile solution. Even then they don't need bitcoin. They need something stable and trusted.


This is mostly an untested idea. We don't actually know how (and if) people will use smart contracts. 
Bitcoin network is mostly centralized, so I don't see any advantage that bitcoin has over any other centralized solution, bitcoin is actually in disadvantage because today popular centralized systems are trusted and have all the network effect.
Why bother compete against systems that have all the network effect, isn't it a waste of everyone's time? Especially when the alternative doesn't even deliver what it supposed to (decentralization).

I can only warn, as I did many times before. It is absolutely immoral to promote bitcoin to the general public for the reasons I've provided. 
Most of those who promote bitcoin, don't do so out of the kindness of their hearts. They have all the incentives to ignore facts and manipulate information. Bitcoin is a get-rich-quick scheme for most of these "investors".

Just look at the history of pump and dumps in crypto and you will conclude the same thing. The fact is, when very few people control an enormous share of the market, they can manipulate it, and they can crush the market if they wish to. This is undeniable and that was done many times before. This is a fact.
To warn people about the fact that some anonymous early adopters can crush the bitcoin economy at the push of a button is the least I can do.

My point is that traditional currencies don't need to compete with bitcoin, because what we have today is good enough. It works. Bitcoin was compared to Esperanto, and I think that this is a good comparison. 
If there will be a need to upgrade traditional trusted currencies, with actual network effect, then they will be upgraded. Nothing to do with competing with bitcoin. The tech can't disrupt an industry by itself. You need to give a reason for people to actually use bitcoin. 
Most people who are "invested" in bitcoin, treat bitcoin as if it is a lottery ticket. They don't view it as a currency. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 04:13:31


The damage they can do is irreversible. Just image what would it do the confidence of the coin when the early adopters will start to cash out. 
Those big hodlers, only by moving the coins, showing that they have access to the private keys will crush the market, without them even selling at all.
And we are talking about the so called true believers, but they are people too, and there is not such thing as perfect security. They might not sell just yet, but someone might get access to their private keys.
Bitcoin users wish for this absurd system to become the backbone of the future global economy. Let's pretend that this insane scenario actually happens. Can you imagine what it will do to the world economy when the real dumping will start? We re not talking about some company going bankrupt. The Great depression will be nothing in comparison. 
And all of this can be done anonymously from a laptop at a push of a button. This is the nightmare that the get-rich-quick schemers are promoting.
Immoral is an understatement.

"**What do you see happening with bitcoin in 2015, or even beyond?**
Tyler: *So my prediction is that this is the year of infrastructure for bitcoin, I think 2015 is the year where we're going to see real, US-regulated exchanges. We're going to see other infrastructure type financial products that really lay down the foundation for all these great innovation and possibilities.*
*Our two efforts on that path are of course Gemini and COIN. I think you're going to see more merchants adopting bitcoin. I think there's a really good chance that someone like Amazon builds their own infrastructure to accept bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.*"
