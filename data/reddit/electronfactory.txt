I had mined about 25 bitcoin myself but it was only worth about $0.25 a bitcoin. It was left on the pool since I didn't have enough to withdrawl at the time. It's definitely gone. Sorry.

He is recycling the heat in a Stirling Engine, so power is not so much a factor as he is able to reduce his line load. I'd be interested in seeing what his efficiency is.

The order book is a great way to get a feel for what the general demand rests for price. It's a tool that you need to use and understand. There are fake bids placed, but many of exchanges are starting to crack down on this activity.

You need to stop defending this guy. I'm shocked anyone is defending his actions. You are better than that, he could have been  better than that. He chose to screw a *lot* of people for his own monetary greed. The world is full of crooks looking to get rich, and I don't know why. Maybe they are angry, maybe someone screwed them. Maybe the *system* screwed them. All that matters is he did something wrong and he doesn't deserve pity. He tricked people into believing it was a safe investment. He lied, plain and simple.

It's sad to see you so apprehensive. I use a bot myself and it isn't just randomly hitting the buy button. It looks at indicators and studies historical data (like a meteorologist studies weather patterns). Does it work? Absolutely, but I don't expect you to believe it considering your closed minded approach on price action prediction. I can generate a 2-3% profit when  the whole market is down 5-10% just because the bot has been programmed to understand these indicators. There's also the genetic algorithm plug-in in for the gekko bot. This plug-in uses historical data as a reference and it modifies its own buy/sell strategy to match price movement as it appears similar to older data. This is called backtesting and it is a normal function that traders use. Take some time learn about these things instead of dismissing them with distaste. Also, bots don't affect the market. A market with just bots still would act like a normal market. Bot strategies are all slightly different and each bot retrieves prices at varying times. This means there is *always* enough variety to disrupt any synchronization of bot buy and sell events. These bots are programmed by human beings, so they are buying  and selling like a human being. They are just quicker and do so with less emotion. I might make a bad call because I'm scared of a loss where the bot simply does as it's told. The outcome of what I would do versus the bot is still random, but many times emotion has lead to a bad trade.

I'm afraid you don't see the irony in your own statement. This guy knows the space alright, he knows how to con people. He knew bitconnect was a scam, he knew he could get his followers to make him money. He is a criminal, and that's not honorable in any way. The man has no redeeming qualities. Any human being on this planet can lead his sheep to the slaughter. That doesn't take *game.* Had this man found a way to help people, and limit his own greed, he might have gotten out of this with some shred of dignity. Now, his face will forever be shamed with infamy. He is a street level rock slinger of the crypto world. That's his *game.* Anyone calling him an idiot is justified.

The average Joe doesn't understand the complex network of the electrical grid and the over simplification of using said light bulb. Bitcoin is currently developing its own network and eventually it will be easy for less technical people to utilize.

You maybe missed the point of what bitcoin is. Its a currency platform. It was never intended to be an investment, but it was clear there was a possibility. The miners and early adopters who speculated its success are the ones who stood to make a lot of money because they stood up the currency. That isn't a Ponzi scheme, at least not intentionally. Let's all understand, there are people who use bitcoin and other crypto to pay for things and people who use crypto as an investment. It doesn't matter what happens to it because it's being transformed into whatever the general public wants.

I hope you are only referring to the 90% of TV users who make 1st grader TA's that don't account for all the data, they only build them based on how the hills and valleys look. There are a small amount of TV users who actually make some very good calls.

Bots are not 99% of the trading volume, unless you care to give me credible source on this.
Your pedantic nature of describing the way human beings trade is enlightening. When I said they behave *humans*, you ran with it. I commend this.
Yes, I am *consistently* making 2-3% a day. If you really need me to bring your a spread sheet then we can handle that another time. I was a day trader that just watched candles all day, order books all day, going stare crazy and wearing out the paint on my mouse buttons. The bot has given me back my personal life and I trust it do its job. If it wasn't successful, there wouldn't be such a massive following. The very instant any reports come out that bots don't work, do you think anyone would trust thousands of dollars to a random dart throwing machine? Hell, the stock market is run mostly by trading bots.
Human traders do affect the market, after all we control it. The tools we use to control it are a side effect of it's existence.
TA, indicators, etc. I really won't argue with you on that. It isn't worth the time. You use solely math, remember? Why would you have any reason to believe in human psychology.

That logic doesn't work in crypto, where value fluctuates like a woman's emotions during pregnancy. The problem is people who are selling their bitcoins are moving their money out of crypto, and that's dragging down the asking price. Money is simply leaving the market. Why, is a loaded question. All any of us who haven't sold can do is wait for the money to start pouring back in, because right now the only way anyone is making money in crypto is by shorting fellow traders. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:33:54
Don't you dare sell. That would be a *massive* mistake if you can't control your emotions. You are already too far from your bought price to short. If you sold out now, you will have given up $20 *thousand*, and bitcoin will swing back up. You will be devastated. I know this because it happens way more than it should. Hell it happened to me.

It's because just about every trend analysis is bullish. People only care to listen to fantasy because its fun to imagine things getting better.

I'm just curious myself as to what's causing this massive sell off. Is this a historical event of repetious nature or is this something possibly uniquely new? I haven't seen the streets flooded with exotic automobiles...so where is all the money going?

This isn't a traditional loan. The *bank* is giving you a way to access funds you normally wouldn't have. You will pay them back one way or another. The way it benefits you as the trader is if the price dips. They loan you a certain amount of bitcoin and you sell it, with you hoping that you will be able to buy it back cheaper when the price falls. You get to keep the difference in profit and then you return the loaned bitcoin to the bank. If you succeed, the bank loses because the bitcoin is now worth less than when they gave it to you. On the other hand, if you fudge the change in price and it goes up instead of down, you *STILL* have to buy the bitcoin so you can return it to the bank. The difference is that you have to use all of the money you made from selling the bitcoin, plus you have to fork over your own money to buy back all the bitcoin you were loaned to return it to the bank. In this scenario the bank wins and you lose, because they get the bitcoin back and it's now worth more than when they gave it to you.
Interest isn't involved because this is a gamble the bank is willing to take that you will lose. They don't have to give these loans out, but they do this because they typically end up winning no matter what. Even if you successfully short, the bitcoin goes back to the bank, and they turn around and just loan it out again. The bank isn't taking the biggest risk here, because they automatically close your trade if the price goes up too much (this is based on how much capitol you can wager with. The more, the higher it can slip). It can mean you totally lose all of your own money and the bank has nothing to worry about because they aren't loaning anything out without collateral and hoping you can afford to give it back.
