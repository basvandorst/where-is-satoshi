The core of my original question was, if it’s a poor currency (which you acknowledge), why should anyone invest?
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:07:26
I agree with you, but most other investments would have some indicators of when to get out. What are those for bitcoin, other than a crash?
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:47:25
Yes. But does that fact that bitcoin is currently the “winner” mean you should invest in it?
I guess my question is: if you’re not betting on bitcoin in the long term (and it doesn’t seem like many folks are), wouldn’t you be jumping ship soon?
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:05:39
I wasn’t talking about crypto currency in general. Pretty likely that’ll catch on. But Bitcoin, AFAIK, is a pretty shit one, so again, what’s the point?

Seriously. These are the folks that stealth followed 6 guys named “Herb” and all 5 Spice Girls, for god knows how long before anyone noticed.

I don’t think so, but I enjoy it.

How can you say “every imaginable challenge” when it hasn’t even gone through a US bear market? 9 years is a very short economic timescale.

Are you saying no one knew Bernie was fraudulent? Some guy went to the FEC like 3 times trying to warn them.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:42:22
Ok. Why won’t it go to zero then?

You just lovingly crafted like 3 different straw men while addressing no part of my comment.

I’m not backing an alt because I would have no idea when to buy or sell, and I have these same qualms about all cryptos. It’s just that bitcoin seems to already be out of date. I’m sure many more will follow. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:25:43
No, it’s not. Stocks, bonds, real estate, other currencies all have something tangible behind them. Bitcoin has nothing. There’s no management, no products, no real use except as a “currency” that is pretty awful at currency things. 
And if it can’t be a currency then what the hell is it good for? Crypto isn’t exclusive to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:32:49
What are the fundamentals then?
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:20:49
I’m not saying other investments don’t have downsides, just that they have some sort of tangible value behind them. If the USD plummets, there is still the US economy, resources, and government behind it. If gold plummets, there’s still the actual metal with its variety of uses. If Apple’s share price plummets, the company still has its staff and technology.
If bitcoin plummets, what is there to fall back on? The block chain isn’t bitcoin exclusive.

So... you don’t know them?
We don’t ask atheists to prove that there isn’t a god.
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:04:28
If you’re just refusing to post any idea of what the fundamentals are, why should I bother with this discussion? We could all save time if you just posted some.
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:44:47
That’s not my argument though.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:24:40
I’m not saying crypto currencies and the block chain are useless. I’m saying, if bitcoin is outdated implementation of both, why should anyone buy?
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:24:14
Never invest in anything because of FoMO.

This is how I feel like every week.
