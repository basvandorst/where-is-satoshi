You shouldn't be too worried about when people accept BTC as payment. That's already happening. However the more likely scenario is that people will stop accepting USD as payment.

Contemptible behavior. Coinbase is barnone the easiest way for any member of the general public to enter into their first bitcoin transaction. It's the hybrid model that gets the public in the door into being able to put hard earned cash into something they might not even believe in yet. This will do real damage to the public's already fragile trust in bitcoin as a viable currency, and even technology for that matter. I am ashamed. --

I have a decade's experience with C++ and Java, however more of my work these days is in Javascript using the AngularJS framework and Node. I wouldn't be opposed to Ruby, as I have some experience in that language as well.  Preferably, AngularJS front end, Java/Node back end.

Hah, nope, I've coded _professionally for 15 years. I'm 33 now, started at age 18. Graduated Summa Cum Laude while working full time at a hedge fund called Stark Investments in Milwaukee, WI. I've built portfolio management, risk management and scenario based software for traders and analysts. Lots of the software is still in use today, but it is highly complex and proprietary. What I do, I do well -- but only a handful of people get to see my work due to financial disclosure / NDAs.  As far as actual time coding, I started coding on paper when I was 12, and didn't have a computer. Then I read magazines to get up to speed, and "imagined" what I would code when I would finally get a chance to work on a PC. Eventually I started _actual_coding in high school and got a jump start on my education -- very self-taught, and learned the business by working under local leaders in my industry.

Why are people upset about the business cycle working?  New opportunities create the chase for capital, and some of those ventures will fail, while others succeed. We should not be discouraged by failure, but instead be happy that bitcoin creates decentralized businesses that will never be too big to fail.

Warren Buffett will be dead in 20 years. Quite frankly, I don't think his opinion has much weight in deciding whether or not a technology will exist at any point in the future. He has admitted himself that he does not understand technology, and chooses to avoid investing in technology based companies.

I appreciate your perspective, but you may have left out the possibility that someone may be interested in spending that amount of BTC because they could have been an early investor, and effectively have the ability to purchase a home with an actual initial dollar cost to them of $2500. It's a stretch, but possible. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:30:43
The point is to show that a transaction of this size can be done with bitcoin. Even if it had to be done via bitpay, this can be done. It would make for a good news story, and also instill confidence into the system after the FUD and negative news hitting the mainstream media.

I read the  book - while it does go into the depths of the theories used at the very low level, it is not a very good programming resource to be honest. Developer books need code examples that go beyond a page of code. The ratio of talking to code is way too high for developers to use.

In technical analysis, we refer to this as the "retest" of the breakdown. This is very much like a retest of a breakout, but in reverse. The market is testing to see if the prior support that failed, is indeed resistance. The future is never certain, but we can apply probabilities to it based on patterns. Break over 426, resistance is broken. Fall back, it's going to take bulls a lot more work.

As both a developer in the  space and a personal trader of options, futures and other derivatives, I whole-heartedly agree. There are rare opportunities like these that only a percentage of the global population even can come close to understanding. I built software around the modeling of CDS/MBS, CDO, CDO^2 during the 2007-2010 time period -- those who understood them made lots of money. Those who took the opportunity for granted lost out. it's interesting to see what the public will look like in 5-10 years for laughing at us bitcoin freaks. Even if you're not a technologist, the first time you transfer money from the US to China instantaneously, you get that magic look of wonder in your eye. There is real value there. --
