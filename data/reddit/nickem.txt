Bitshares is is an industrial-grade financial smart contract platform. 
Parcoins is a alt coin
@_date: 2015-08-02 21:08:13
It's similar to nubits only that "somebody" guarantees the value. 
Parcoins code guarantees the value. Parcoins has a program just like bitcoins. Bitcoins are mined. Parcoins are purchased. Bitcoin does not have a value except what some people will trade them for. Parcoins are the same except the trade value is ALWAYS some amount say $500USD. If someone wants to buy a Bitcoin thinking that the value will change then go ahead and pay market value for it. If someone wants to buy Parcoins knowing that the value will never change then go ahead and buy it at the market value of $500USD. The code for parcoins keeps a secure ledger. It buys Bitcoins and Sells Bitcoins. It also buys Parcoins and sells Parcoins. A parcoin can not be instantiated unless a Bitcoin worth $500USD has been used to purchase it. It has value because it will never go away unless someone sells it for a Bitcoin worth $500USD. At which case, I suppose that that Parcoin will have a value of exactly zero until someone buys it for $500USD. Of course, it may be used to purchase a partial Parcoin.

NO It's not holding cash. It's not using the banking system. It's a coin. Just like BTC-e exchanges BTC for LTC, They could also accept USD Parcoin. If someone wants to know the cost of a Parcoin it's $500. If BTC is $250 it will buy 0.50 Parcoins and vise verse. It's as secure as the blockchain because it has been given it's value when it was traded for Altcoins.

You don't understand.The code has a ledger. Parcoin receives 2 bitcoins each valued at $250. The one Parcoin is produced with a value of$500. The ledger shows income $500, outgoing $500. = Zero balance. Now someone wants to sell their bitcoin for Parcoin. Regardless of the price of bitcoins at the time of the transaction, the order always cancels out to ZERO anything. They are actually purchasing their bitcoins back and paying for them with Parcoins which are worth $500. If the value of BTC is less, they need to include more bitcoins to assure the balance of $500. If the BTC is worth more then they need fewer BTC to reduce the balance to zero. The Ledger will always be ZERO, practical accounting.

Here's a scenario:
2 bitcoins ($250USD ea) are used to purchase 1 Parcoin. A new Parcoin is instantiated with the value of $500 (the price paid)
Scenario 1. Bitcoins increases to $500USD. Someone wants to buy a 2 Parcoin. It costs 2 Bitcoins and a new Parcoin is instantiated. 
Scenario 2. Bitcoins decreases to $125USD. Someone wants to buy 2 Parcoin it costs 8 Bitcoins. That new Parcoin is instantiated.
Scenario 3. Bitcoins increases to $500USD. Someone wants to sell their 2 Parcoin. They will receive 2 Bitcoin. Their Parcoin now has a value of 0 zero!
Scenario 4. Bitcoins decreases to $125USD. Someone wants to sell their 2 Parcoin. They will receive .125 Bitcoin Their Parcoin now has a value of zero. 
It's a Zero sum game for the Parcoin. (except if a fee is established for support, etc. IDK. I don't give a *** about who loses or makes money with this scheme. 
I'm not saying it's possible, I think it's doable in the sense that what little I understand about the structure of coins it's maybe plausible. Just looking for knowledgeable discussion. i think it has a market for many various uses (personal reasons).

There's also the problem of trustworthiness. Although traditional or fiat currencies may not be based on an underlying asset like gold, they have an implied value due to their universal adoption. Bitcoins aren't backed by a hard asset or a large government, so there is no guarantee that bitcoins will hold any value in the future.

TA only indicates where you were. Patterns speak of tendencies. Indicators compare 2 or more patterns. 
The Stochastic crossover is a popular indicator for many reasons, buy/sell signals more than anything else. The CCI breakout is also a strong one (similar to RSI). MACD confirms trend direction.
My favorite for long term is buy/sell on the 12/20 DMA crossover. use shorter time frames for a hair trigger short term call.   Look at the BTC chart and you can see there is a 12/20 at this moment. 
Look at thousands of charts and try to compare the action to the indicators.
EDIT: Crossovers are a predetermined buy/sell (long/short) signal that makes my decisions for me. If a buy signal turns out to be wrong then the sell signal will occur shortly. Piece of cake, except in a flat trend, in which case flip a coin.

My argument is based on my premise that it could be just as profitable for a establishment to sell bot's to clients who want to partake in the mining of Bits. (this is apart from your example of "legitimate miners" as they cooperate in the purchase of machinery). A mining based on shared profits while utilizing the same bot methods (except for the illegal part) would establish a level of competition which would (could) eliminate illegal bots from becoming relevant in regards to the 51% situation. A purchase of a legal bot would be a scheme for exceeding the investment cost over the long run.

I use candlestick and daily charts. 6 hr. charts are as tight as I will go but only when I think a trend change is beginning. I don't want to try to catch tops and bottoms. I've been active with BTC for a few months but made paper trades since the top. The trend can be found by noticing the position of the present daily candle in reference to the daily moving averages. once the trend is determined, it can be traded, as long as it isn't flat. I buy when the candle stays above the moving averages and conversely, sell the downtrend. All trades MUST have a mental stop loss. Sell into a down trend. Buy into an up trend. The big trends continue over weeks and months. In my opinion, there has only been 8 or 10 big moves so far. Take your time getting into and out of a trend once you identify one.  Look at the 3 mo daily chart and notice a trend change to sell around mid Jan. An astute trader from that point would likely still be waiting for a buy signal. Hint - watch the volume. 
Any trades within a tighter time frame that I discussed and you are on your own.

When, for example, a 50DMA (longer) trends up from below the 20DMA (shorter) and "crosses", it is seen as a signal that the trend has gone from downward to upward (Buy). Different averages can be used for different stocks depending on it's volatility. 
Set up a chart with say a 6 and a 20 Day Moving Average (DMA). When shorter DMA crosses below the longer DMA it signals that the trend is trending down (Sell). Conversely, is an upward trend (Buy). Observe some charts and inspect the past results and future outcomes. Experiment to decide which DMA lines will suit your method of trading.

@_date: 2011-11-16 01:53:54


Can the Government own an exchange in a private manner?
I think that something is being overlooked; the reason Bitcoins were developed in the first place. The value is going to also  depend somewhat on velocity (the rate at which coins are exchanged and utilized in commerce). BC are somewhat inflationary because the money supply is increasing. It would be deflationary (value would increase over time) if the money supply (money being exchanged) decreased.

At present a $7.00 BitCoin is worth about 1.75 grains of $1900.00 Gold. I will be looking forward to seeing how that relationship develops and whether it remains stable. It seems a waste of effort to try to relate it to an method of exchange which is loosing value without a fundamental means of measurement. Therefore it makes more sense to measure the value directly whereby a grain of Gold has (for example, using the above numbers) a 0.5714 exchange rate with the BC.

OK - here's the thing. The price difference between the close and the 25 day moving average is around 50%. That's a huge differential which should normally be in the 10 to 25% range. (speaking as a technical analyst here) It needs to either consolidate for a while or drop a little to reduce the ratio.

Bitcoin (BTC) is directly convertible into domestic cash (fiat, legal tender, etc.). The buyer can use local cash to purchase BTC to make a purchase. The seller can convert his new BTC into local cash. Using this point of view, it's more like a credit card transaction where the local cash is converted by the vendor into their preferred monetary value.
You really should be promoting the benefits of BTC rather than trying to explain the currency itself. Develop some "Sales Skills".  Use the standard for selling anything. **Features and Benefits.**
What is the feature? low exchange rate. What's the Benefit? Higher profits. Get the point? Salesmanship requires Sales skills.  [As an example](  You can find better sources with your own research. Become a salesman. Forget BTC, find out from the client what his concerns are regarding CC  services (for example) and explain how a Benefit will solve his problem. Then get "the order".
good luck.

Once people are using less than 0.01 btc, the unit will become satoshis.
When it was 100$, a btc was worth 100,000satoshi. A suffix like "ts" would represent thousandth satoshi. ie 100ts. Add zero's as appropriate just like when using btc.
At 1000$/btc, 1$ is worth 1/1000btc or 10,000satoshi. It's a simple and logical conclusion.
Edit - The satoshi will be acceptable the same as lite coins and other digital currencies even though it is a subset of bitcoin.

Personally I wouldn't trust that scheme.
[Wikipedia]( if creditors (note holders of gold originally deposited) lost faith in the ability of a bank to pay their notes, many would try to redeem their notes at the same time. If in response a bank could not raise enough funds by calling in loans or selling bills, it either went into insolvency or defaulted on its notes. Such a situation is called a bank run and caused the demise of many early banks.
Starting in the late 1600s nations began to establish central banks which were given the legal power to set reserve requirements and to issue the reserve assets, or monetary base, in which form such reserves are required to be held.

Cash just happened to be the most acceptable method of value transfer at the time. The cash was used as a transfer, not a payment for goods produced. I could have sold my BTC for labor, produce, personal note, commodity or any other acceptable contractual agreement. Without cash there MUST be a method of value transfer. The market will provide.

For accounting purposes, Digital currency is treated as Foreign Currency. There is an exchange rate between different DC's. Amazon, for example may accept dozens of different DC's then quickly convert to something more stable or Business Finances friendly. 
The exchange rate in one country may be quite different in a different country or location.
When a DC becomes too volatile, it may not serve the markets interests as a stable store of value and therefore become worthless as a clam shell.
