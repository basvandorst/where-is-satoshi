This: "America is a scam. It's a monopoly by a few industries who buy off your politicians. Health care costs are not really that high, it's just this monopoly that keeps your citizens paying top dollar for mediocre care,"

it is a metaphor to illustrate the finite characteristic of Bitcoin but then you knew that. you're clearly just trying to be difficult.
all metaphors break down at some point.
As a recovering pot stirrer, it takes one to know one;)

paper money or fiat currency is not backed by nothing, it is backed by Debt. this is worse than nothing.
Bitcoin is a very different animal underestimated by many because they try to compare it to regular money. apples and oranges.

Bitcoin is mined like Gold; but instead of pickaxe or sifter, an ASIC rig (computer) is used.
Fiat currency is debt because it is created from loans.

banks lend the money other people deposit? Not exactly.

banks will wake up and then care when demand for their fiat currency, which is created through their loans (read debt), disappears... but then will it be too late for them?
this is a different time &amp; your grand daddy's bank ain't in kansas no mo.
understand the fractional reserve system, then look at current unfiltered monetary trends &amp; you will see the writing on the wall.
