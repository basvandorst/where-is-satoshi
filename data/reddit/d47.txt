This is the dodgiest looking scam I've ever seen.
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:12:06
Does it only accept 4 digit pins?
Seems that way from the photos.
@_date: 2016-08-22 13:30:53
Why can't they see the order of words?
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:01:57
The language is entirely irrelevant, you can write exploitable code in anything you want.

All ATM's I've seen have totally unfair exchange rate, skimming off up to $20.
I use coinbase to buy and just transfer straight to my hw wallet.
I used to use bitfinex but.. yeah.
@_date: 2016-08-20 07:16:06
You know you don't *have* to use blockchain.info. You're welcome to use a wallet you actually like.
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:21:38
Wow I hadn't heard [this story]( before.
Probably not such a ridiculous amount at the time but considering the price hit the $1000 mark not long after that, they probably lost quite a lot of potential money :(
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:22:23
No, the chance of a collision like you describe is astronomically low.

I remember playing runescape I had a pin to access the in game bank.
Each time you pressed a button the numbers would randomise again.
With trezor the numbers stay in the same spot for the duration of the pin input. If someone was watching your screen and saw the buttons you pressed they would get quite a lot of information about your pin number.
Imagine you pressed the same button twice,  so your pin is, say: XYYZ or XYXZ.
Someone who saw that now knows that there are actually only 3 numbers involved and your pin is effectively only a 3 digit pin.
If the numbers randomised each time that'd improve security (even if only a little). I wonder if there'd be extra risks doing that because of the constant communication with the device? Perhaps an advantage for having the keypad on the device itself.

My verification charges never showed for my card two weeks in a row. So meh, I guess my bank just doesn't show them.

Very scalable.

Twitch doesn't process donations, only subscriptions. But generally a subscription will appear on the stream. It'd be up to the individual streamer though. Highly unlikely that it'll mention the payment method also.
@_date: 2016-08-27 08:33:44
Coinbase most definitely services US customers.
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:23:37
lol, I'm not criticizing, I use bitsquare all the time. Obviously they have an interest in growing their own platform???
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:10:54
Thanks to informative reply (as opposed to your presumptive and hostile one), I'm now aware that the fee goes to the arbiters, not to bitsquare. I didn't know that.

Before someone sends this guy $5 please take a moment to see the obvious bait.
I can't find a lot of links, but this happens all the time and people keep falling for it.
@_date: 2016-08-01 01:24:00
What on earth do they teach in their 'certificates'?
@_date: 2016-08-11 06:20:08
they take a fee.
@_date: 2016-08-26 09:54:37
It's the most obvious answer, I would bet that this is what's happened.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:14:55
Yeah that's the idea, that's what people are intending with their funds. That's why they keep a large sum on there. Read about margin funding.
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:30:21
I wonder what happened to those 10,000btc.
Did the pizza guy hodl or what?
@_date: 2016-08-20 08:05:05
The guy who used to manage the server of the silkroad thing even mentioned being hacked, losing bitcoin and transitioning to a system with hot and cold wallets. This right before bitfinex likely had the same conversation.
@_date: 2016-08-21 22:28:16
Oh yeah you're right. I forgot about the cheering since it's so new
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:09:27
Bitfinex stored all or at least a large portion of its btc in bitgo guarded hot wallets.
I believe Poloniex only stores a small fraction in such a wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:19:14
Yeah similar story in Australia :(
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:13:54
Here come the shill accusations.
@_date: 2016-04-25 02:02:05
presumably without bitcoins.
And what makes you think it would start again anyway?
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:48:31
Yeah I totally lost 1000btc
Feels bad man
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:13:49
Yeah, I lost nothing. There were periods where I had up to 1btc on bitfinex for at most an hour at a time.
Not that I was expecting the exchange to crash or be hacked or anything. Just seemed safer.
@_date: 2016-04-24 14:23:37
Then the universe will end.
@_date: 2016-08-26 12:09:31
Think of e-coin as BFX tokens.
@_date: 2016-08-28 13:15:54
you mean the hoodrlolic press channel.
@_date: 2016-08-27 06:24:48
yes, very slim indeed, that's the idea.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:36:51
The value of a bitcoin is determined by the buy and sell orders on each exchange.
So if on bitfinex, someone buys a bitcoin for $700, then the bitfinex bitcoin price becomes $700. Then if on coinbase someone buys for $650, the price on coinbase is $650.
The exchanges don't set the price, the buyers and sellers do.
Your ticker is just getting it's price from a different exchange.

I would upvote, but eh... too much effort.

Literally anything
@_date: 2016-11-17 22:32:14
You're digging yourself into a hole here.
Bitcoin asics are not programmable, the definition of a cpu is that it runs the instructions of an arbitrary program, not that it simply "does math on input".


@_date: 2016-11-06 03:52:12
I never realised how prevelant baseless numerology voodo was in finance util I started taking an interest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-01 03:21:52
It's confirmed now! :D
@_date: 2016-09-07 08:28:29
It's a common occurrence on this sub, usually it's people asking for $5.
Obviously you have some reason to want $2 in btc, so why not for free?
Here are a couple of threads asking for small amounts:
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:44:11
Do they support odd euro currency?
Or do I need to bundle two transactions?
@_date: 2016-09-07 07:36:34
The onus of proof is on the OP for his outlandish claim.
@_date: 2016-09-06 01:09:57
yes I know, thanks.
@_date: 2016-09-07 07:48:27
This guy is fishing for a changetip donation.
@_date: 2016-09-18 01:26:52
Hahaha no
@_date: 2016-09-15 07:49:00
You can buy them on Amazon with almost any currency.
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:39:44
Maybe they should've called it OpenUsefulShop instead.

I bet they found a use for those bitcoins sometime late 2013.
@_date: 2016-09-09 07:00:04
Damn, good question.
That would be interesting.
@_date: 2016-09-14 01:33:39
You are quite clearly delusional.
@_date: 2016-09-12 07:23:18
Why would you just link it like that? It's not that rare anymore.
I drew a Pepe with my eyes closed and folded it into a safe. It's so rare not even I've seen it.

Not sure I would pass on BITCOIN for RBITCON.
Perhaps "bitcoin" was taken though.

If you want to buy some bitcoin then yeah coinbase is a decent place to get some.
@_date: 2016-07-26 03:57:05
Wow, it must be nice to be able to do that in America.
Where I live there are maybe a few hipster coffee shops that would accept bitcoin.
And even then they probably never do, so when I go to pay I'd expect them to wonder what I'm talking about. I imagine them rummaging for a bitcoin address or fiddling with their POS system to try and accommodate me.
