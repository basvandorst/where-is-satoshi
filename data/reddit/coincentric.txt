Because new software exploits are discovered all the time. This applies to stable libraries like openssl as well as to bitcoin core itself which, I'd like to remind you, is still classified as beta software. 
Then there are changes to the protocol like adding support for OP_HODL and changes to [how transactions are prioritized]( If the blocksize limit is to be increased that will require an update. Bitcoin is still very much a work in progress.
Also just adding a new node is not enough. You have to be using it to verify your own transactions. A node that no one is using does nothing for the security of the network.

The blockchain has no enforcement powers so it is dependent on governments for that. Just because it says in the blockchain that such and such a loan was taken in exchange for such and such an amount in collateral doesn't mean that the collateral in question has actually been surrendered to the bank or if it has it is actually worth enough to secure the loan. The blockchain can't ensure any of that.
Now if the collateral is in bitcoin or some other crypto currency then it is a different matter. But for tangible assets the data in the blockchain could well be different from ground realities.

A private keys is a 256 bit random number. Because the possibilities for such numbers is truly astronomical it is impossible for anyone to guess or compute your private keys. The relationship between private keys, public keys and bitcoin addresses is explained below:
The trezor stores your private keys and does transaction signing for you. Since it is a device that is dedicated to doing just this job it is much less likely to be infected with malware than a general purpose computing device like a PC or mobile phone. This is why it is considered more secure.

Store a copy of the software as well with the backup. Also note that both multibit and electrum are open source projects. They are not going to just disappear.
If you insist on a paper backup only then you are going to have to print out the private keys and that will mean your backup will get stale very quickly as you use new addresses. Wallets are not designed to encourage address reuse. New ones are generated for change all the time. So don't mess with individual private keys.

As for buying either go with an exchange and be ready to submit personal docs or buy from local bitcoins traders and be ready to pay a premium. And don't think you can buy from anywhere using a reversible payment method like paypal or CC. Bank transfers are the most widely supported method.

But you will still have to rely on the government to ensure that the contract is enforced. You still have to rely on the nation's justice system to punish any party that reneges on their contractual obligations. This might not seem like a big deal in the west where contracts are taken seriously but in most developing countries contract enforcement is still not there.
Also lets consider for a moment what will actually be stored in the blockchain. Certainly not the entire text of the contract because blockchains are very inefficient what with all the duplication of data on thousands of nodes. Only a hash of the document will be stored so that it cannot be modified. Transparency will not be improved because the actual contract can be kept secret until and unless there is a dispute. This is good for privacy but bad from a transparency PoV.

Edit: In the normal course of operation that is. The private keys are never sent to the PC/mobile when you are signing transaction or using it in on a day to day basis.
However, when you first create a trezor wallet it will display your seed mnemonic so you can make a backup of it. All the private keys are derived from that so you can restore your wallet in future if you have to.

The [server]( keeps a copy of your extended pub keys so they know all your addresses and hence all your transactions. It's even worse than electrum because with electrum only the addresses that you have used + future addresses up to the gap limit are revealed to the server. The xpub is never sent to the server. There are also multiple public electrum servers that you can use. AFAIK there is only one publicly accessible BWS server - the one run by bitpay.
I think revealing the extended pub key is a security risk too. As you know xpub + private key of any one address is enough to get at the xpriv of the entire branch.

In that scenario you could dump your private keys and import them into a newer wallet. You don't have to connect to the network to dump priv keys.

Deriving the seed is not as simple as you think. An 80 bit seed that generates 19bit ephemeral codes means lots and lots of collisions. You'll need lots of ephemeral codes to compare and narrow down the list of possible seeds.
Honestly if you can MITM the user it would be easier to simply change the content on the web page and trick the user to withdrawing to your address.
Edit: You know what I'm missing the obvious. If you can MITM the user in real time then can't you simply reuse their OTP code for a withdrawal? OTP codes are valid for 30 seconds or so and that's plenty of time to automate a withdrawal request to the server using the user's hijacked session.

Post dated cheques are widely used in South Asia too (Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka etc.). In fact the main reason businessmen use cheques is because of the post-dating ability. You can pay your suppliers on credit by handing them a post-dated cheque. Similarly you will get post-dated cheques from your regular customers and often you endorse those over to your suppliers.
When individuals purchase something on credit for their own use they are sometimes asked for post-dated cheques.
All of this is for convenience and documentation rather than any sort of guarantee of payment. Cheques frequently bounce and you usually work it out with your customer rather than escalating it to the authorities.

No. The vice versa is also true - not all addresses that begin with 3 are multisig. They could just be pay 2 script hash with a single private key unlocking them. Maybe the funds there are locked until a certain block height is reached (CLTV) or some other custom script is at work.

It is affected. Chinese speculators will now pull out money from their stock exchange and put it into things like bitcoin. Back when their stock market was booming they did the opposite and it affected the price of bitcoin. Also bitcoin is affected by changes in the value of the renminbi.

Donations are negligible. Various attempts have been made to monetize the software:
- Multibit takes a tiny extra fee for every spend transaction. 
- Electrum tries to make money from its partnership with trustedcoin 2fa. 
- Copay is pushing a canadian exchange presumably for the affiliate revenue. 
- Blockchain.info makes money from advertising on its site. 
Apart from bc.i I don't think any of the others are making decent coin.

Ok hold on a minute. You are definitely not a 3 with questions like those. Those are deep questions for a newbie.


I believe this is true. 
Fees will rise over time to compensate miners for a falling subsidy. Right now they are rising because space on the chain is scarce. It's demand and supply basically. Still quite cheap to send coins so I don't see what the problem is.
To answer your other questions fees do prevent blockchain spam which causes bloat. Remember the chain is replicated on thousands of computers worldwide and spam transactions waste space on all those nodes.


Seems to be the idea. They do intend to raise the blocksize in the near future. They just haven't decided on it yet.

It is common but you should be worried too.
The thing is bitcoin companies fall into a legal grey area. Banks don't like them so they can't get accounts at reputable institutions. And there is no regulation of these companies so your private docs could wind up anywhere. But this is how it is with them all. They all demand your ID and shit if you want to use them. It's up to you whether you want to take the risk or not. 
I can tell you that two companies circle.com and coinbase are considered more reputable that most. But they are US only. There's also gemini which is supposed to be a regulated exchange. It's run by the winklevii.

An unspendable transaction output aka coin burn. This will have to be carried by all the full nodes out there for as long as the blockchain exists. This is not good.

TLDR; It's not safety that will be your primary concern. It is compatibility with the bitcoin network going forward.
Longer version: It's not safety that will be your primary concern. It is compatibility with the bitcoin network going forward. For example there was a recent change in how transaction signatures are generated which made older versions of electrum incompatible. So you couldn't spend the coins in your electrum wallet until you updated it to a newer version. If something like that happens again and armory is no longer maintained you will have to migrate away from armory. You can always do that with a private key export and then sweep those into an electrum wallet.

First thing is you misunderstand what private keys, public keys and addresses are. So let's clear that up first. 
Private keys are 256bit random numbers. Private keys are never made public. They remain secret.
Public keys are derived from private keys and are mathematically related to them. You can't derive a private key from a public key. Each private key has just one public key. They are called a key pair. The public key is revealed to the world and the world uses it to verify transaction signatures generated by your secret private key without you having to expose said private key to the world. Bitcoin public keys are also 256bits.
Hash functions - Hash functions take arbitrary sized data and output numbers of a fixed size. They are one way functions. You can't take the output of a hash function and determine the input. Hash functions are used to create "fingerprints" of data. If even a single bit in the data changes the output of the hash function will change.
Bitcoin addresses are public keys run through hash functions. The hash functions used result in 160bit addresses.
Because 256bits is greater than 160bits all addresses can be unlocked by more than one public/private key pair. That's where the 2^96 comes from. But this refers to key pairs behind bitcoin addresses not private keys behind public keys. An address is not the same as a public key. It is the public key run through hash functions.
There is such a thing as a deterministic wallet and that uses a single random number to generate a whole tree of addresses. We don't call that random number a private key though. We call it a seed. Each address there has its own private key and they are indistinguishable from randomly generated keys to anyone who doesn't have the seed.

All bitcoin transactions are public so it is NOT a private payment method. It is in fact the opposite of a private payment method. You should assume the bastards are data mining the chain.

hashing the wrong way can actually make it worse. here's an example of how to do it properly:
You have to append the password to the hash from the last iteration during each iteration.
Frankly I think it would be better if you just created an electrum wallet and wrote down the seed mnemonic. Why invent your own scheme when there is a perfectly good one out there already?

Look at all the activity in the country thread on the forum:
I'll summarize the Pakistani economic situation to you guys. It's a very poor country with nukes and terrorists and none of the great powers of this world are going to allow its economy to fail because that is a deadly combination. So it will always get the bailouts it needs and there is nothing to worry about.

It's not a [security safe]( that's for sure. It's a bitcoin full node.
Jokes aside running any sort of server means opening yourself up to an attack vector that didn't exist previously. So there is some risk. There always is.


Yes this is true. Your IP is never secret anyway regardless of whether you run a server or not. IP addresses are not secret! And bots do use bitcoin so they will ping your full node. That's actually [one of the use cases]( of this programmable currency. Do you have an irrational fear of computer programs?

The blockchain cannot scale without additional layers like lightning. The blockchain is the settlement layer and we use it directly today for our little transactions. In future ordinary people will never use the settlement layer directly and they will find it amusing that we actually did. 
Fees are increasing because space on the blockchain is scarce and demand is increasing. To reduce fees you can build that second layer that I talked about or you can increase the max blocksize. The latter will increase the size of the chain and the larger the chain the fewer the number of full nodes and the less secure bitcoin becomes.

That's some legal system you have where a company is breaking the law paying for expenses from its own money. The money is owed to employees at the end of the month and not before. It can do what it likes with that money until then. I can't believe you expect businesses to create a separate pot for wages.

You should update your wallet because there have been changes to what types of bitcoin transaction sigs are acceptable. Older wallets generate unacceptable signatures.

There is no such thing as a public address, private address or super secret uber duber address. There are only addresses, public keys and private keys. Please don't mess up the terms.
Bitcoin nodes are the ones that verify transactions and they won't know the difference. All they care about is whether the public key hashes to the same address as recorded in the blockchain and whether the signature is valid. 
The numbers involved are astronomical so its impossible to find a private key whose public key hashes to a given address. Here's an awe inspiring image about it:

- Fees will increase if too much spam is posted to the chain
- In the medium term the full node count will go down because of blockchain bloat.
- Bitcoin will become less secure and fewer people will use it. That includes both legitimate users and abusers
- Lower blockchain spam relative to increasing computing power will make full nodes cheaper and the full node count will increase
- Bitcoin will be more secure and users will be attracted to it again.
- The whole cycle may repeat
Bottom line is an equilibrium can be reached in this manner between legitimate users and abusers. All without the need for a central controlling authority.

I doubt the devs and full node operators will appreciate the spam but that's what they are planning to do. Hopefully they'll use op_return so that the transactions can be pruned in future.

According to a presentation by Jeff Garzik centralization risks are there if the max blocksize is too small *or* too large. If it's too small transaction fees rise and people shift to centralized wallets with only settlement done on-chain. If it's too large running a full node becomes expensive so the number of full nodes goes down and you have centralization that way. So somehow the developers have to create a balance here. 
A second layer consisting of sidechains is the only option long term. Bitcoin cannot scale without them.

There is no way the Indian government can afford to subsidize smart phones. They are considered a luxury item in South Asia and it would be a huge extravagance for the government to spend on them.

They have to wait for advances in semi conductor fabrication technology. Then they have to design ASICs to use that new tech and that takes time. 
Advances in semiconductor tech are an industry wide push and it is not possible for tiny bitcoin mining companies to do that by themselves. It takes the financial muscle of behemoths like Intel, TSMC, Global Foundries and Samsung to do it.
