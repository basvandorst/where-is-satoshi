Go into QT console and type


(obviously change the bitcoin address to the one that originally held the coins before you tried to send them)
Then copy your private key into electrum.

The 12nY address has no funds on it so they got moved somewhere. The first address I came accros that had any funds on it at all was the above address (1F2bMfwF3X3dRT1qtKswGiWbKf2peRu1a4), and there is about 18btc on there. Is that a wallet that you have control over? If so it seems like your coins got sent there.
Also the only transaction leaving the 12nY address happened on November 5th, are you sure that is the right address? The total bitcoin transacted is 4.1btc and you said you are only missing 1.9btc so I think that might not be the right address.

Not sure what you are talking about.
It sounds like you tried to send coins and they did not propagate the blockchain (they do not show up on blockr.io correct?)
If that is the case then your coins are still on the original address that you tried to send them *from*. Since you stated that you sent it from Bitcoin QT, i believe (if memory serves me right) that you can simply import your wallet.dat file into electrum and that will import the private keys from QT into electrum. When I had a similar problem this fixed it and it showed my coins on the original address in electrum, and I was able to resend them.
If this doesn't fix it then there is probably something else at play here and I can't really help you. All I know is I had a *very* similar issue and doing exactly this fixed it.

This is the only transaction coming from the 12nY address
Which says it was performed on 2015-11-05 05:10:29, which is before the date you just said. So that leads me to believe its not the correct address, also because there are no transactions that add up to 1.9 or 1.8 from this address.

If importing all the private keys didn't work, then I am kind of at a loss here. Either you missed one or you are checking the wrong keys. You need to find the key that *originally* held the bitcoin. Trace it back from the source if you have too. If it didn't propagate through the network there is virtually no place those coins could be except on the original address. You could try checking through every key that you have ever used on the blockchain to see if any of them have any coins at all.
If none of them do then I am at a loss because they have to be *somewhere* they can't just disappear or get sent to a rogue address.
@_date: 2015-12-18 12:12:59
I have a feeling that the 12nY address is not the original address because the only transactions occured a month *prior* to when you said you made the transactions. I would look through other address that you have.
It seems like if the coins were sent to your Bitcoin QT you should *definitely* have the private key somewhere on your computer, meaning that you should just be able to find it on a list in Bitcoin QT or dump all your wallet.dat keys and it should be one of those but it seems like you already did that and didn't find anything which doesn't really make sense to me...?
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:07:12
Try importing the private keys with the coins on them into electrum wallet.

It's Scumbag Steve of course!
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:15:29
If you don't know then I'd recommend going through *all* of your public keys and importing every single private key into electrum until you find the missing coins.
Alternatively, If you have a transaction ID (txid) you should be able to see where the coins were sent from if you search for it on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:00:31
Good luck! hopefully that works for you too. It sounds like the same problem I had (QT didn't send the transaction and it got stuck forever, didn't show up on the blockchain, etc.) which means that your coins are definitely still there on your private key they just didn't get sent, I think because your transaction got included in an orphaned block.

Yeah in 4 years after you graduate. They're usually not due the same year you take them out.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:03:50
Depends when in 2014 you bought, but you'd also have money from the loans so not like you'd be penniless.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:39:17
Only if they sold their bitcoin. If you bought at literally any time in 2014 you'd be in a huge profit right now.
@_date: 2012-10-29 23:54:51
I hope this is true.

Sorry I probably wasn't clear enough. As you can see from that confirmation email the address is exactly the same as the addresses on the block chain and on coinbase, capitalization and all.
@_date: 2013-09-01 02:51:44
This was also the first time I've used my account in almost a month so there shouldn't have been any confusing the only thing on my recent history is an inbound transfer. 
Thank you, hopefully this works itself out I don't want to have to find a new exchange.
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:14:06
I'm gonna use your exchange because i love GOLD :)

Thanks :) I sent you a PM, if you have any questions for me don't hesitate to ask!
@_date: 2013-09-01 02:49:30
I replied via email and opened another support ticket to make sure they understood I included the same picture as above minus some editing and was pretty clear both times that it was inbound.

Do they have a phone number? I emailed them but haven't received any response yet.
@_date: 2013-09-01 04:01:25
I have little doubt that I'll get my money back the real problem is that it is *eventually.* I understand that nothing is perfect, however they should have some sort of warning that states: 


I felt quite blindsided by the fact that I am *still* unable to access bitcoins that I transferred over two days ago, especially considering that I need that money now and I really don't have time to be waiting an unknown amount of days to get it. If I had known that there was the possibility of my money being held up for this long I would have chosen a different exchange that is more reliable.
@_date: 2013-09-01 05:05:09
Would you mind explaining how exactly I access those coins then?
I went under account settings &gt; Bitcoin Address, then I generated a new address and sent the coins there, they showed up at that address, and under my coinbase transaction history, yet not in my wallet. So how do I transfer my coins from that address to my wallet? or can I?
@_date: 2013-08-30 21:37:30
Definitely the right address, I mean it shows up in coinbase as received by that address. [There's also this.](
I've already contacted coinbase but i'm still waiting for a reply. I was just wondering if this happens to anyone else or if this is a unique case?
@_date: 2013-09-01 04:48:52
I feel the need to comment and say that the reason I said that they "stole" the coins from me is because I was deprived of wealth and services, I am still being deprived, and I have seen zero effort on their part to fix this. The message the rep responded to was pretty clear in stating that the bitcoins were not in my wallet, yet he blatantly disregarded that statement and the multiple pictures I sent to him detailing this fact. Instead responding with a cheerful statement stating that "the coins are there" when, in fact, they are not accessible to me in anyway. They have also, as of now, ignored all of my subsequent emails and support tickets.
I don't think coinbase is acting maliciously, but it affects me all the same, I am being deprived of money that I am in urgent need of, without warning and without a guarantee that I will receive those bitcoins. The reason for the sensationalized headline is because a company that deals in money such as coinbase should either have a functioning system, have representatives staffed that are capable of dealing with their malfunctioning system, or at the very least, they should have a warning *clearly* stating:


These in my view are extremely poor business practices, the only real reason why i'd even consider sticking with coinbase is because of a lack of serious competition. However after this fiasco i'll definitely reconsider using them as my go-to.

Thank you. What was the issue you had trouble with?
