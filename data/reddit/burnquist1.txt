Same. I've never thought texting through Facebook as being easier than a phone number.

What's this new FBK coin that popped up on the upcoming ICO calendar? Proof of like algorithm.

So tether isn't safe or is it just being looked into?

I can track people and I just sent 100 people to your location to take the last makeup in the world from you in exchange for bread. Have fun stocking up on stuff we'll take from you when needed. The end of days people are so funny.

Yes they can. In the same exact way they did it with gold. In 1933 they forced everyone to turn in their gold in exchange for dollars, making private holdings illegal. Turn in your Bitcoin for this paper equivalent, (which years later we will decide to no longer honor redemptions in Bitcoin) or go to jail.
This playbook has already been written. You buy BTC with USD. Who has the most USD? US citizens ARE the hoarding tool. They're just waiting for the right moment. My guess is they created it and are simply using an old tactic digitally for precaution.

Yup, cause that's how averaging works.

Man, you are sooo bad at math. Where do I even start? This is historic average, not current average. So in your example, you are counting everyone that has died in their 90's, 80's, through teens, infancy etc. and those people will not age at all, even in your additional 30 years. Because they don't exist anymore and the data is locked in. Does that make sense to you now? That is why in 10 years the average did not go to "37". 
I hope that helped.

You need to look into Bitcoin shorting. People are making money selling and at the same time, making money off the price crashing.

How many coins does this trustee have left? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:18:27
If there are so many "criminals" in crypto, then how is this guy that has such control over shorting the market to zero still alive?

lol at all this so called analysis. They throw out 10 different predictions just so one guy can say I told ya so.
