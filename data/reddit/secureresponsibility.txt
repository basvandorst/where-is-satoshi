We need to force them to pay for the privilege of buying our Bitcoin. $250K a Coin would make me happy for now

Money in the Bank is useless. Bitcoin has done more for me than any dollar amount in a Bank. Debt Free and living life on my own terms from zero to freedom in 3 years flat

the bankers are going to be working to make sure this does not happen,its up to us to make sure it does. Who has more ammunition?

First they come for the Bitcoin sellers..
Stopping the sellers...stops the buyers..limits the growth of the little guys getting rich..
NEXT they will be stopping the buyers..UNBANKING people who buy Bitcoin using their Bank accounts. (they are doing this now already)
So whats next? Regulation and outright Banning or do we start transacting peer to peer without involving the banks at all in our personal finances. When the Govt starts accepting Bitcoin for TAX PAYMENTS its over  We have won
