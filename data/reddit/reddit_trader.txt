Very US-centric and incorrect view actually. Credit card fraud is only a problem in the US, where chip-and-pin is not prevalent. Also mostly applies to online shopping. I've never heard of a restaurant ever getting a charge back outside of the US.

The "developing countries" ship has sailed. The direction that Core has chosen is one where it costs 5cents+ to write to the Bitcoin block chain. Unless a competing implementation becomes dominant, this is the new normal.
Note that LN will not solve the problem as transaction costs are lower but funds need to be locked up to guarantee them. Clearly locking up funds is a no-no in poorer countries.

No, it's not true. Some settlements are really fast. There's a huge same-day market for government bonds, even (in particular?) in the US where the payments system is the shittiest otherwise. I remember times when my middle office guys needed to get securities from clients half an hour before the day's cutoff and they did! Why is Blythe Masters looking at the syndicated loan market, a niche? Because other markets are much more efficient! Even in FX where people are looking to improve upon CLS, everything is same day already, so you need to get better than same day, meaning you need to be real-time. If transactions take 10 hours to confirm, Bitcoin's not gonna cut it.

@_date: 2016-02-05 14:40:06
My actual transaction was less than 500 bytes. It still took over an hour to be included.
Now, I am indeed bitching. In comparison, SEPA transfers don't cost me more than $0.50 and they are almost instantaneous. If I - despite the high fees I pay - find Bitcoin shitty in its current state, how dire must the situation be for everyone else? Your argument is also disingenuous because fees (in absolute terms) are not dependent on the transaction value. Had I wanted to transfer $50 (what most people want to do), would you have told me to pay $0.50 in fees?
$0.50 for $50,000 is 0.1bps, that's high. A lot of the financial world operates on margins of the same order of magnitude. Wasn't Bitcoin supposed to improve things?
@_date: 2016-02-05 13:57:46

What I suspect Barclays is doing here, is using Safello to convert bitcoin payments. Safello will receive bitcoin donations on behalf of charities and will auto-sell them on Kraken. Said EUR (could be GBP too, but I suspect EUR) will then make their way into the charities' accounts at Barclays. Charities will probably lose 5% in various fees.

Fed Funds is just the average rate at which banks trade Fed balances with each other within the Fed.
For every bank that borrows, there's one that lends. So banks are lending at c. 0%
As for the Federal Reserve banks (i.e. the NY Fed, the Dallas Fed, etc.), they don't lend or borrow at Fed Funds. They don't benefit from low interest rates. They're not actual banks.

Personally I think it's bad. Here's my take on this new regulatory wave: the bitcoin ecosystem does not generate enough value to pay for the cost of compliance at the moment. Sure, Coinbase etc. *have* enough money to pay for those but they don't *make* enough money. Look at BitPay, they misplaced a million dollars and everyone's losing their mind.
The bitcoin ecosystem is not ready. You need big dumb money that pays fees and bid-ask to afford all those legal bills. Big dumb money is either institutional (Fidelity and the like) or retail (mom-and-pop). Currently, institutional interest is nil (banks have blockchain interest but banks don't pay fees - they charge fees). There is no mainstream adoption despite high hopes. An ecosystem of hackers and geeks can flourish (it has!) but they can't pay lawyers... Bitcoin might never take off and remain the method of payment of the darknet. I hope I'm wrong.

This is not correct. The open market operations consist of repos and reverse repos. Those operations have no impact on the Fed Funds *Target* Rate (that rate is not a market rate - it's an objective set by the Fed). Neither do those operations have a direct impact on the Fed Funds *Effective* Rate, as that one is set (as I said earlier) by actual transactions between the likes of Citi and JPM. It does, however, have an impact on that market, since they are substitutes to each other to a certain degree.

1) You're mixing up losses due to uncollateralized exposures and losses (or lack thereof) due to collateralized exposures. Funnily enough, Lehman went bankrupt because non-mark-to-market assets (subprime ABS) were matched on the liability side with short-term collateralized borrowings. Had Lehman's liabilities been unsecured/uncollateralized in nature (and long enough in their maturity), it might not have gone under.
2) BNYM is a tri-party repo agent. Their whitepaper is just an ad for their tri-party services. Even if it were not, collateral management is not credit risk management. Your solution seems to focus on credit risk mitigation. It doesn't help with collateral management. If anything, if used widely, it would exacerbate the current collateral shortage since the only eligible collateral for your solution (as far as I know) is bitcoin.
I'm not here to shoot down your idea. I understand that you need to sell your product. It's like when you see something incorrect about your specific field written by journalists: gotta chime in.

Nnot really. The derivatives counterparties that want to collateralize don't have any problems doing so (therefore your service doesn't help them) and the ones that don't want to, well, they don't want to (so your service is irrelevant to them).
Actually the collateralization of derivatives between banks works so well that the Lehman bankruptcy was pretty much a non-event in that space. So, no, the 2008 crisis was not caused by a bunch of derivatives counterparties that wanted to collateralize but didn't for technological reasons.

At 9 million euros, your valuation is a bit rich.
Edit: and you're not an exchange. What are you, a broker? Where is the description of your business? The word "exchange" doesn't appear in your FundedByMe description at all.
Also, what about those financials? You provide no financial information. Your projected cash position is a joke - you project to grow revenue ten-fold  but hope to maintain your expenses under 1 million (EUR? USD?). How many employees do you have to pay?
I feel sorry for anyone who would invest on that basis.

You are indeed referring to a meaningless technicality. As a matter of fact there are inexpensive real time gross settlement systems such as TARGET2. 
CHAPS is a RTGS in the UK but it is a bit more expensive.

Pretty sure he meant Brussels as the seat of the EU's legislative body, dude.

This was part of my job until recently, I'm afraid you're not going to teach me about TARGET2.
From the ECB: 


With regard to whether TARGET2 is an actual cheap real time gross settlement system that can be accessed easily (the issue at hand), *it does not matter* how the Eurosystem has designed cross-border flows among *itself*. It's like wondering if a dollar at the Chicago Fed is the same as a dollar at the St Louis Fed. 
It doesn't matter who or how the payment goes through. The entity you're paying is not the central bank. All that matters is that if you pay a liability via TARGET2, the liability is extinguished. And the payment is very fast.

TARGET2 money *is* central bank money.
From the ECB website:


Edit: I think you're referring to TARGET2 imbalances which have to do with the way the national central banks of the eurozone are federated under the ECB; those imbalances are not related to the issue at hand

This is very old news. People have been talking about that problem for a few years now (basically ever since rates went negative in Switzerland).
Corporate deposit rates are often negative.
The problem is compounded by stupid regulation regarding the stickiness of deposits.

No specific expert on Lehman but within the financial system (i.e. all their deals with JPM, MS, etc.), OTC derivatives were collateralized in 2008. I do agree that replacing the **risk** of those positions that were closed out (the collateralized ones) was perhaps no easy task, but it was not a financial stress.
A much bigger source of stress was the increase in haircuts and non-renewal of ABS repo which led to fire sales (interestingly illustrated in the movie Margin Call!)

Market makers don't need an edge over other customers. Their edge is that they're smart.

Cool story bro. Last year I bought a Spotify subscription from my sister. In Germany. From London. With a credit card.

Your arguments are well written but that doesn't make them strong.
Your views on inflation are typical of some libertarians'. That doesn't make them true.
In many European countries, wages are indexed on inflation. There goes half of your argument. Secondly, inflation is good for debtors with fixed interest rates (read: poor people) as it reduces their debt burden over time.

If the hard fork is "successful", does that mean that you will have been wrong on your estimation that &lt;5% of the Ethereum community had supported it? What are the goal posts in your view?
Let's agree on terms: by successful, I mean that the market value of ETH does not drop to an arbitrarily low number, say $5, in the day or so after block 1920000

This subreddit is such a circlejerk. Say what you want about Brian Armstrong, he's right here. If Ethereum survives the hard fork, it will emerge stronger. I make few predictions but here's one: the reduction in uncertainty likely lead to a sudden increase in price.
