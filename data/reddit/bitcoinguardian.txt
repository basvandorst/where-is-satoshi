They have different sites now. With similar tactics.

@_date: 2017-07-14 06:28:43

@_date: 2017-07-02 08:46:07
Yep, they have stopped paying off. We're done. Forget about it.
@_date: 2017-07-14 06:30:30

Check their facebook pages but do not post. There are a lot of people who are asking for emails with similar modus. I'm afraid we're not gonna be able to recover our money. Same with the WannaCry and other ransomware shit.

Well, they're down. Less info now available. Any luck?

Legally, depends on jurisdiction. 
Technically. I don't know how to. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:51:39
Ah, it's alright. Sorry too.
@_date: 2017-06-26 08:20:46
If you know how too... but that would be illegal..

Because "common sense" is not "common" in the cryptocurrency world. Everybody sees this as the "Wild Wild West" and the new digital gold rush. So, you have a point, but people who are aren't smart enough, aren't knowledgeable enough who may be greedy (but who the fuck isn't huh?) - **deserve** to be **pro-actively** warned.
I understand you don't want to deter newcomers about the many goods that bitcoin offers - and there are many opportunities out there. But distinguishing the line, especially now that when bitcoin is priced at $2,600? or is it $2,700 now - is not more apparent - the rules are different yet the same here - the question is: how different? How similar? 
I'm a long time lurker here and I can only wish that I have been warned. Yes, I was greedy, but going into bitcoin - like I said, who the fuck isn't?

**Who in fucking bitcoin isn't greedy?**
Bitcoin's primary lure to investors is plain and simple greed. Speculation. 
Don't come at me with your self righteous pretentious prick attitude. You're just as fucking greedy as I am - you probably got into Mt. Gox yourself. 


How the fuck can we know that the normal rules apply when bitcoin's valuation is at $2800 now? Justify that. To us newcomers, it's like, wow, everything is magical. We try to educate ourselves, but there's too much material out there - there's too much hype, how in the nine hells can we distinguish which from which? Who to believe when there is no regulatory structure and when there is anonymity involved. 
All I'm saying is, **people deserve to be warned** I think we can all agree with that. 
And no, the rules in cryptocurrency are similar yet are different. To us newcomers are only starting to feel the ropes so to speak. Right now, we're like, **Wow, bitcoin is now at $2800**? 
Your line of reasoning will come at your face, IF and WHEN this valuation pops. 
The thing is, if we have been educated, if we have been warned, we would have thought otherwise. 
So for you to fucking judge me and for you to **condemn all the people who are not as smart as you** by not offering the **pro-active warning**. 
Fuck you.
Your self righteousness will get back at you soon and you're just as bad as the motherfuckers who started this.

To convince suckers like you and me to invest more. It's still running as you can see.
