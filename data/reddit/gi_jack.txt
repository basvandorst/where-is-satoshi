forks are terrible, because they break if everyone is not using it.
I'd be great if he tested it on testnet or made another coin to test it.

we already have dogecoin, what else do we need.
there are already too many cryptocurrencies.

again, people assume that everyone is essentially the same, and people don't approach things with diffrent motives.
some people like to quietly profit
some people like to build things
others just like to watch the world burn.(and sometimes there is motive).
Bitcoin introduces some great concepts, but it still has ways to go.

what I am trying to say, is that for sites like ghash, they have an intrest in the continuation of bitcoin, and the legitimacy of cryptocurrency.
Whatever money they could make in the short run by ripping off the system, and destroying it, is nothing compared to steady income over a large peroid of time, which is more consistant with their business model. Something about killing the goose that laid the golden egg.
Bitcoin companies only profit if the long term price of bitcoin is high.

I hate to break it to you, but if electricity completely vanishes, most of the worlds fiat currency is also going to be completely worthless as well, due to secondary effects of such.

it can be tracked, but not easily.

I'd be warry of cryptocurrencies as well too. BTC is great, but it also has its flaws.
Eventually the block chain is going to get large enough that its unwieldly to download, and eventually needs more space than the average person has room, and eventually it will not fit on all but the largest of hard drives.
Eventually diminishing returns on mining is going to make mining unprofitable, and a decrease in hash rate, and cheapness of second hand miners will make 51% attacks feasible.(there will be a threshold where there is more incentive for attackers then miners).
BTC is also based on a single hash protocol SHA256, while this is not neccarily bad, if SHA2 ever gets broken mathematicly, they are all worthless, while all other SHA2 implementations will simply migrate to something else, bitcoin can simply change hash protocols.
I am confident in time we will find answers to solve these problems, and bitcoin did a marvelous job paving the way for future cryptocurrencies. For the last issue, I believe X11 solves this problem by using 11 hashes in sequence in case one or two of the ciphers get broken, the coin still lives.

Bitcoin has a "because its new and wierd" problem, and the unforunacy that many of its pioneers in day to day usage where criminals.
That said, I pay for all kinds of goods in BTC, and I preffer it to paypal, bank transfers, credit cards, for purchasing goods online. It is far far far more secure for the customer than more established e-payment means. Reason: there is no information that can be stolen that can be used to empty my bank account or make unauthorized purchases.
 There is also no middlemen who get to decide who can and cannot send to recieve funds.(paypal,visa, and of course your bank have stated they get to decide who you get to send money to online).
But before the criminal argument gets into play, bitcoin is far more transparant than paypal, visa, and your bank, because all transactions are on public ledger. Instead of the above three getting to disclose at will who they want to share your personal information from, and whos they want to hide it from.

It is wrecking havock on the price of BTC though. Drugs and guns be damned.
