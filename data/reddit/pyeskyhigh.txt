Does anyone know when the bitcoin software was initially posted on SourceForge?

Okk sweet I was just wondering if the launch was the same day of the release of the code, or if the code was released on the day?

Does anyone know when the software was available as open source? and do you know of a source to find that info?
On Github it says August 30th 2009, but isn't that later than the release of BTC?

Complete negative correlation. The impact bitcoin can have on our health is amazing, let alone our entire lives! How can people be against this???

This man has no control. I saw this video right after and he needs to learn how to hold his public view (already too late for that).

It's like the team that is dedicated to working on the protocol. They are the ones dedicated to developing the updates.

Yeah, anyone have a link where Charlie Lee says that he would upgrade to a larger block size if his blocks were full? Because to me that sounded like absolute complete bullshit.

Watching the charts is much more interesting than listening to my teacher right now.
