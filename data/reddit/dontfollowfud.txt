It's good to know this kind of exposure brings baby boomer money into the crypto space, but this bit is just cancerous.

I didn't claim/mention crypto on my taxes at the start of 2018. I invested in early 2017, but have never converted any crypto back to fiat.  Do I need to report this at some point on taxes in case I ever decide to take some fiat out so that I qualify for long term gains? My trading has been minimal. I guess I'm wondering what paper trail you need to have to prove the length of time has been over a year. Technically I haven't taken a "loss" as I still have the coins, but the value has gone down. Should I be stating that every year on taxes? Thanks for the help.

that's fair... but I like my friends of reddit and some direction is better than none. seemed like a pretty basic question that some may have pondered or looked into. have a blessed day blue.

I like your optimism. I share similar views from my experience. Hindsight is 20/20. I do hate my brain at times for having thoughts of "think about where your portfolio standing would be now if you had been patient enough to exit December and enter now". I had so much denial at that point though. My emotions were spot on to a market cycle, even though I had lived it before. I didn't assume it would correct this heavily and worried about paying capital gain taxes for pulling out too early. Even with paying 40% taxes, I would still have more holdings now...   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  oh well, I have plenty of time to earn back any losses over the course of my career, but doubt how many opportunities will come along like this in my lifetime. There is value in the lessons I've learned.

I understand the concern of those worrying about an account being held hostage, but this would not have happened if he wasn't flooding millions of dollars through the exchange daily by abusing arbitration. I doubt those expressing sympathy are exhibiting this kind of behavior in the frequency and volume of their trades. Of course this kind of behavior looks fishy from the perspective of the exchange. That money isn't coming out of thin air, he is making gains on other investors in the community across a plethora of exchanges via a bot. This guy isn't some financial genius, he is running a script to abuse the system. I understand arbitration has been common in history in various markets, but the invention of bots to do this kind of behavior takes the creativity out of the process. There is a level of "work" needed to arbitrage in other markets (precious metals, sought after goods/services, etc) where time is invested to make those gains. This just feels like cheating in a digital market.

He is making his money by abusing arbitration bots to accrue this amount of BTC. Seems like an inherit risk of this level of greed.  I'm not sure why OP is surprised that his account would be flagged consistently moving this type of volume daily between a plethora of exchanges.
