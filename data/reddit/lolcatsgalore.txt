OK, you win, cant prove it, Satoshi merely suggested a way to increase block size limit, which means bitcoin can do at most 3 tx/s and tx fees will increase and confirmation times will be several days or weeks. Decreasing bitcoins usefulness as an electronic peer to peer cash system as was the title of Satoshis whitepaper.
As we have already seen tx fees go high, confirmation times long. Great. 
If you want to buy and hold such a currency, great for you, in fact I am selling you some right now on exchanges.

Fuck all of you, you are not in position to "compromise" on anything, only hashrate matters. Show the hashes or get the fuck out.
BU for life.

You dont understand differences between numbers like 1 and 4 and 9. 
Cant help you with that.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:08:59
Well, as you see here in the source of bitcoin core software, 
This, line 
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 1000000;
is the block size of bitcoin people are talking about. You see that number, 1000000? That is what the block size is about. You see, in bitcoin core version, the block size is still only 1mb. This is the year in 2017. The issue was first discussed, even Satoshi mentioned it, in 2010.
I am afraid it is your brain which has gone soft and is led to believe that somehow the above number and line doesnt exist or actually says 4000000?

That is where you are wrong kiddo.
Bitcoin is the same technology in 2011 as it is in 2014 and 2017, dont you agree? But the price is very different.
Just because people fail to understand and perform a correct valuation, of many things, and instead rely on mumbo jumbo hokus pokus abrakadabraka price is, kind of valuation, then even when many agree on that kind of valuation, does not make it correct.
The price does not dictate everything, a perfect free-market does not exist anyway, all "market-prices" are fail, when you realize this you realize Bitcoin is unstoppable, and is the hashrate.

Development decentralization for the people!
Not one single software. Not one core. To each their own!
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:03:29
Core doesnt even have a block-size increase software, and this is 2017, what are you talking about? SegWit?
WTF man, block-size is the issue since 2013, not magical unicorns. There is only so much you can fit into 1mb no matter how hard you try, it is a limit. We need to remove the limit. Increase the block-size, dynamically like other coins have done, or by emergent consensus, doesnt matter, just remove the damn artificial limit. The real urgent issue, then you can have cred to begin talking about SegWit. Until then, Core is blocking bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:53:47
Its not. its sold as it but it is not even close.
you too can check the code. block size is still 1mb in core version of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:19:53
You believe in magic, so that '1' is actually '4'? or 5? Seriously, consult a doctor if you truly believe that. But maybe not a doctor, Ive seen people believe they are Jesus.
Drugs are a helluva thing, stay of them for a while.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:22:44
Satoshi was against 1MB block size limit forever.
Satoshi said "if blockheight X then blocksize_limit = 32MB".
If Core is so open for anyone to participate and review the code and make improvements. That is what BU is, its a modification of Core software.
 
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:38:26
Im not sure the current bitcoin core developers and supporters understand the support for something like 
It looks like some people think that bitcoin core commands the price, when its the other way around.
The only mistake is we are in 2017 and still without a decentralized trustless peer-to-peer transactions because of bitcoin core supports and their poison.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:28:14
It is just you.
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:14:33
Just use banks if you dont trust the miners
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:17:41
Maybe, we can ask Core to have miners sign a letter to deliver proof of electricity consumed as measured by the wall, and ask electric companies all over the world to sign a letter, to verify their delivery of electricity to a miner.
That way, bitcoin would know who used how much electricity, and it doesnt matter which version or kind of computing device was used to mine. Bitcoin Core can then invoice the miners, or set the price or block size depending on this electricity usage data.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:38:58
Im amazed how you can actually think 1000000 can be changed to mean it is more than that. And further, if that actually for you means the limit is forever removed?
The only cesspool of shit and delusions, magical technology and unicorn land, seem to be r/Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:18:37
Exactly, and no cryptography would be even faster.
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:15:15
You cant compromise on sha256(sha256()). What is there to compromise over? That core are retards and will stop being retards, how exactly?

It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade."

No, do not occupy more space . Yes, they do fit more segwit-transcations, not normal transactions in the same blocksize.
Let me ask you now one question. Does SegWit allow basically infinite scaling of amount of transactions that can be done? In other words, what is the limit with segwit. 1.4MB or was it 2MB effective with segwit?
Do you see how ridiculous it is to solve the blocksize drama by moving it away for a while instead of actually making the whole drama issue go away for ever?
 
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:55:29
Ive seen that but its just marketing pictures. 
Doesnt explain anything at all. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 12:05:41
Full nodes can can be operated with compressed blockchain, solving your whining.
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:37:55
Who is blockstream?
And what is segwit?

People in here seem to have their heads up their asses, this byteball is to bitcoin what bitcoin was to hashcash.
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:40:02
Enlighten us what those concerns are, using bitcoin over ISDN and on AMD Duron CPUs with 10MB hard-drives?
@_date: 2016-12-14 09:58:45
Thats a video.

SegWit is 1.7MB compressed in 1MB block-size, while using 4MB actual data outside the block.
Or you know, increase block-size to 4mb and be done with it. But, oh well.
