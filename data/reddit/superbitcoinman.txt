Part 2: Satoshi for President
Blockchain voting becomes the defacto standard for elections.  Satoshi's coins haven't moved for decades.  Bitcoin wealth has become a measure of how useful each person or business is, as the dishonest have long sold their coins for material possessions.  The first blockchain-based elections take place and for the first time in history Satoshi moves his coins to throw his support for an altruistic candidate to run the free world.

This project has become to0 big. 
A team with revokable cryptographic trust is needed.  Decentralization is the lesson we have learned.
Cmon guys, we can do this.

They are a B+ company that has done a lot of good that we all forgot whenever the fuck something up for a short period of time.  Isn't Andreas still with them?  I doubt he allows this for too long.  
IMO Blockchain is a good actor, they do seem to lag behind the best of the best when it comes to things like blockchain spam/faking vectors. 
Please fix it Blockchain, but IMO we must remember how many 100's of 1000's of humans must have been turned onto Bitcoin because of the easy get-from-app-store --&gt; scan-address-on-phone --&gt; whoa it's on my computer too! type of functionality that Blockchain.info has provided for years.  
Yes, we need to hold them accountable and demand a quick fix, but also we need to remember they are not a "Joke" - they are $30M fiat-infused player who has tried to be good actor but slipped up in some overall minor ways but very important to fix the minor ways.
