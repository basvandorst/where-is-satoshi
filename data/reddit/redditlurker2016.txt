I don't know why you are confusing events... You cannot be serious with the corrupt cop tho? I am talking about admins of exchanges. They never get sued or get some jailtime. They blame it on the robbery? Basics in law..... How can I get jailtime if I am the one who got robbed?

Please update us. Solved? What happened?

Oh okey. That's weird. Mind telling me what type of document? Passport scan or something else? If you are verified already I think this is bizarre.

Haha it gotta be one of the hackers...........

No... Why would you even lie about such thing? When the hacker got your private key to some of your addresses, all you said was "Well if you sent bitcoins to your address AFTER we sent out a warning email. We won't refund you." Excuse me? Hahaha. You really think everyone check their email inbox every minute? Tons of people who never got a dime because of this bs. You really think this is OK? It's all caused by your system? Fucking refund people who gives your salary... Show some respect. Greedy.

Most likely, yes. I mean. What can the feds do if it's all done anonymously? "Oh we got hacked. We haven't done anything wrong". They should be sued and thrown in jail.

As long as they fucking repay EVERYONE. Every single CENT I am "happy"

Of course this was an inside job. Impossible you guys have such bad security. I bet you won't pay out a dime. Like last time you got hacked. You really think we all believe you guys, and will forget about how you scammed us all? Lol. No.

Never EVER touch XAPO. They gave me a real headache with a shitty customer service. They will only cause you problems. Read BitcoinTalkForum aswell for all kinds of bad experiences..
