I GOT A JAR OF DIRRRRRT.

Thanks, eh.

I mean like the actual value of BTC right now. As converted by google.

Thanks for this!

I tried to set a limit order to a little under the actual value of BTC and left it for two days but nobody touched it. Do you know how to set a limit order that will actually sell without setting it so low that you would lose a lot of money? 
I don't know how to check the order book, etc. So I will look into that for the next trade.

I just tried Quadriga and got full price for my BTC.

The problem I got was I had a set amount of BTC, went on Kraken, sold for market value and their market value was about $150 less than what BTC is actually worth.

And CAD and USD.
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:29:04
But I was talking about the market price. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:17:29
I'm Canadian, forgot to mention that. I'm looking at alternative right now though.

What are you talking about, lol? I know how to differentiate between the different currencies, buddy. 
And no, rates are different everywhere apparently. Kraken's support admitted to being thin CAD wise, so it's no surprise at this point that their rate for XBT-&gt;CAD is garbage.

Well, I meant that on the exchange, when you go to sell your BTC and select 'Market', instead of limiting it manually, I got a terrible rate. That's what I was talking about.
I understand everyone is saying there is no fixed price for Bitcoin, but I mean, isn't there at least a standard to which people can measure Bitcoins?
Also, when I used google convert to estimate the price of 1 BTC, that's the rate I got on the second exchange I tried..

Been waiting 11 hours-ish here. I hate this crap.
