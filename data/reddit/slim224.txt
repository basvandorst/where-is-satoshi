In EU, Xapo card was cancelled in January, along with Bitwala, Cryptopay, Tenx and Bitpay.

Another relevant stat is that crypto assets are less than 1% of world GDP, according to the G20's FSB. That leaves a massive possibility of upside.

That I know of, but there's probably more. One coming onto the market will be Amon, which will allow multiple currencies with real-time conversion and have AI built-in (if the product is executed):

Yes, two that I know off the top of my head for the U.S. Bitpay is prepaid, so you convert your crypto over to fiat, then spend it. Also, there is the Shift card, which does real-time conversion of crypto from your Coinbase account. Would be difficult to actually use the Shift card because of U.S. tax law, but there it is.
In Europe, Wave Crest cancelled many of the cards in January, so reduced options. Companies in the EU are working on getting new agreements, but it hasn't happened yet for most of them.

This is cool. But users will need a node and Lightning Charge server to run the Lapp. Will there be node/server providers for those not inclined to build them?

Binance seems to have competent leadership, and will probably strike a deal with Japanese regulators. Though they are new and have already been hacked, the fact they grew so fast says something about management.

Granted, the fault appears to lie with the Binance users themselves who were caught in a phishing scam. And Binance seem to have handled the situation well. Still, the affected users were on Binance's exchange and their accounts were used to pump Viacoin. But you're right to say that Binance wasn't hacked in the way Coincheck was hacked.
