Hi Pieter


I've been thinking that this is indeed clearly a trade-off of public sidechains like drivechains compared to a theoretical, more secure implementation. However it may be wrong to think that it is a trade-off compared to *today's* situation.
The possibility of stealing funds from an alternative block chain does exist today, given all the funds that are stored in insecure altcoins. The funds that could be stolen by attacking sidechain miners, today are not at all stored in bitcoin.
Taking this into consideration, it seems to me that there is no trade-off associated with the introduction of sidechains. The value that would be taken away from bitcoin in a potential sidechain theft is the new value that sidechains would introduce. I.e. assuming that all funds from all sidechains would be stolen, this is net neutral for Bitcoin.
In addition, in fact a Bitcoin+sidechains seems to even be slightly better than today's situation in this respect: There is a valid concern that funds stolen from an alternative block chain could be used to attack Bitcoin. There is no defense against altcoin theft in the Bitcoin network. In sidechains on the other hand, *there are* defense mechanisms that Bitcoin nodes could employ against the theft (soft fork).
When I think of it this way, it seems that the net effect of enabling public sidechains would be very positive, since the drawbacks are not introduced by them but already exist, and in addition there are many, very important benefits introduced to Bitcoin, and, by extension, to the world.
What do you think?
