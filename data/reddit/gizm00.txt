the fact that you have to get them to do anything that benefits everyone should be a telling sign.

Can I just say - whilst you are right, that also defeats the original purpose of BTC - being a currency, its not much of a currency if people just hodl it. If thats the path that BTC will go, thats fine, but stop trying to claim that is is a currency or that it will be.

Can we have same for all memes whilst we're at it and try to get the sub back to some normal discussion rather than bashing/cheering

Shit son, I am saving this for future just so I can use it to similar effect.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:15:04
It became what it hated the most, it's no longer a currency and as things are going it won't get there at all.

@_date: 2017-11-23 14:05:32
This shouldn't/wouldn't be an issue if Bitcoin would be a real currency or working to become a real currency rather than hodlers paradise.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:21:30
When will bitcoin move back from store of value to being a currency? How and when can this be expected
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:57:17
What do we say when things sound too good to be true...
Anyway, good if it happens, but it will be yet another step away from currency and closer to being just store of value.

You'll get some of the most moronic excuses, weapons, things they can't afford etc.
But its very simple - taxes.

"using" is an interesting word that you're using when everyone here chants "hodl hodl"
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:42:54
hmm fiat is guaranteed by the government, where as with btc everyone just hope more people buy it to increase the price even more... 
Definition of a bubble:

@_date: 2017-11-23 14:11:51
yes of course, and the problem is its becoming less and less of a currency and more and more of a store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:42:03
Sigh, we get it, you got BTC...
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:22:40
Trying to raise legitimate concerns or have a discussion about it in this sub seems to be like pissing against wind, no matter what you do you'll get wet.
Also it seems its been massively innundated with memes and "hue hue hue bitcoin stronk" stuff.
I am very much bitcoin believer but I would love to have in depth discussions on how to tackle few things and not have folks have a hissy fit if I try to raise a concern.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:04:31
If thats the case then its not much of a currency then is it?
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:47:21
Yes but whats the point of it if noone is actually using it as a currency and everyone just hodls. Of course you can buy some stuff, but literally first advise everyone gives, buy bitcoin and hold it....
It really sounds like a ponzy scheme of sorts, everyone buys, and people buying it are not buying it to use as a currency but hoping more people buy it to drive up the price. So its just being built on nothing imho. The currency is not actually actively used.
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:16:00
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:50:18
that is literally the most strawman argument you could come up with.
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:33:37
As much as I agree with his points, he is ever so naive when it came to government crushing Bitcoin. If government feels that its welfare system is in danger and it can't collect or monitor taxes it will shut down any crypto that endangers it. What I'm trying to say is that bitcoin is good and it's going the right way, but any future added user anonymity will be it's Achilles heel. So hopefully it will just continue as is.
edit: by shut down I mean - make it illegal, thus shutting it down in that particular country. Obviously you can't shut down = eliminate a decentralized system.

lets hope for that.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:18:33
So tax crypto itself?
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:02:06
Read my edit, hence why I said 'currency' and not bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:34:21
right, government hasn't done anything before against will of the people. You do realise I am not against crypto right? I am just saying if government wanted it, they could shut it down, regardless what popular opinion would be or not.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:19:59
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:28:17
yeah most probably
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:20:01
Can I ask a (noobish?) question. Now, I don't care how bitcoin/crypto will affect banks etc, more power to it for what its doing and banks had it coming and I love bitcoin/crypto.
If it ever becomes main stream and I mean, not people just buying and hodl'ing it, but actually use it for every day use - day to day(yes I know you can do it already now, but you know what I mean, when it becomes a norm as such). Basically, it becoming a replacement for current physical currencies.
So at one point in future it is expected to have a transformation from physical to fully digital - My concern is – if a currency cannot be traced and people will stop/avoid paying taxes – the economical impact to the state welfare systems (I’m not talking about politicians and their salaries etc) like hospitals, schools, benefits etc will be jeopardised. And if that is the case, what is there to stop the government banning it entirely or introducing its own currency. I’m looking for serious answers not “it will never happen, they had it coming, who cares… etc” . 
I am talking about if there is a serious concern to the nations welfare capabilities then what stops them to react to it. I don’t care about fees, banks etc, but looking into future – say in 10 years, if not done properly it could have devastating affects on any nation. So why wouldn’t they band together and ban it? What is the solution?
Edit: I'm aware bitcoin as such is fairly traceable atm, what if at one point it won't be or another crypto that is untraceable causes the issue.
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:04:02
Whilst yes info is freely available, it is certainly not low barrier to entry. And its not even about grasping the concept, but how un userfriendly whole thing is. Each currency requires their own wallets, own secret phrases, back up codes, verification of account on exchanges can take anywhere from 2-3 days to a week and so on.
So yeah, all readily available online, but so is everything else...
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:51:51
when I say shut down - I mean make it illegal
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:33:31
So what am I to do with that?
Americans can't even agree on simple things like increase tax to pay for universal health care and your linking me the history of taxation?
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:08:33
Exactly this
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:02:29
Look thats semantics, not all schools are free, but all students (at least in theory) can receive free education, but I am not American, so i could be very wrong.. Either way you get the idea what I am saying.
As you said, its not about what is taxed and how much. 
I am more than happy to learn if you could share with me how it won't have an impact if more anonymity is added - this is genuine interest, not being sarcastic or anything - I want to learn.
As I said I don't really care as long some form of tax is extracted for the government,  as long as it is - crypto is safe, but thats just my humble opinion.
P.S. for all we know we might come up with some very novel way of getting that tax - I mean blockchain is/was revolutionary, so why can't we have revolutionary tax system.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:18:40
Ok so we agree on that welfare needs taxation to be available. 
As I keep saying and everyone just keep ignoring is that as long as its traceable and trackable - it is fine, any further anonymity that reduces that ability - it will not be fine and government can and will most likely take steps to avoid that.
You are very naive in thinking that a every common man will pay tax if they know they can get away with it. Majority of world welfare systems are under strain as they are and this is with mandatory taxation. Imagine that if it becomes "voluntary" cause it can't be traced or taxed.
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:12:13
I mean government, regardless of an origin. Get off your high horse for a moment and just use your brain a little, if a welfare system, that endangers the viability of hospitals, schools, benefits etc, is jeopardized - government will either shut it down or introduce its own currency. And yes on the fringes it might be used even when its illegal and some countries might allow it, but in that particular country where it is not allowed, it would be shut down - if it ever would come to that, which I hope it won't. Hence why I say introducing further methods for users to keep anonymity is not the right path. 
Think of the bigger picture not your tit for tat banks are bad etc crap.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:19:27
I asked the very same question that your 1st point states basically, I have yet to receive a solid answer anywhere, with majority just ignoring this issue. 
Edit: noone seems to believe you can ban it or make it illegal. Where they could easily impose a ban and no legal retailer/service will accept it thereafter, thus killing it basically in main stream
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:53:03
do tell me how will the current welform system survive without tax?
and by shut down I mean making it illegal, not eliminate it - cause as u said it its decentralised - so can't be eliminated.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:07:13
Welfare mostly, cause its the only argument that I can see they can use against crypto, cause as you said it requires some form of taxation. You eliminate or endanger that and government will come down on it like ton of bricks.
Any other argument is really superficial and has no strength, when banks go oh crypto is used for crime or fraud etc to try to smear it, it has no bearing or relevance.
You endanger peoples welfare - it will be completely different story.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:54:11
you see this is where you're missing the point I am trying to make, I don't particularly care what type of taxation system is in place, as long as there is one. Government needs it to sustain its welfare systems. If crypto endangers it - it will take steps to change it or make it illegal.
You cannot simply compare the needs that were 200 years ago and what are the needs now, the population wise, the technology wise, the demand wise. 
I mean lets take as an example New York City - has around [1.1 million students with budget of 25 billion](
Was there any where near that many students back in the day? was it free to every single person? And this is not to even mention other benefits, like health care, retirement etc... that didn't even exist and whatever did - it was due to taxes.
all the benefits that you see now are due to efficiency of collecting more tax, than before.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:48:23
whether they are good or bad is besides the point.

:) well hope its all good folks
