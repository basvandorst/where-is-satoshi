It's definitely not true for currencies.
You can compare the price of baskets of goods in different countries and figure out whether exchange rates are under or overvalued (see  )
You can't do that with Bitcoin.
Regarding your second point, I really don't understand the big deal. Inflation is bad when it's high and volatile, like in some developing or emerging countries. Once it's stable it's not a problem any more. Who cares, really? It's nominal inflation. In real terms, the purchasing power stays the same since my wage and savings grow at the same rate as inflation. So in real terms (which is what economists care about, and most people should care about) it doesn't lose any value.

Oh, and dear please reconcile this view: every report published by investment banks has been dismissed as bullshit by this very subreddit, apparently because bankers are shills of Bernanke or something like that.

That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about the understanding of macroeconomics of the average poster. It's basically "us enlightened euphoric Austrians" vs. "stupid Keynesians", which a very crude understanding of what both groups represent anyway. Interestingly, in academia or international economic organizations (central banks, IMF, etc.) both groups are considered fringe, heterodox groups. No serious economist subscribes to either view (although many economists would be considered neo-Keynesian/post-Keynesian).
But that's fine. No one is an expert in economics. The thing is people here have the hubris to think they know better than experts, than private banks, than central banks, etc.
I'm pretty sure most are teenagers, or STEM graduates working in IT. Every time you get the opinion of an actual economist of Bitcoin, it is immediately discarded...

Why would the price of Bitcoin be affected by this war?
When there's a war between two countries, the price of the commodities they export or import might be affected. Or the stocks in those countries. Or the exchange rates, interest rates, etc.

Generally, the nicest place to live are also the freest one (pick world rankings of freedom, including economic freedom, and indicators of quality of life).
The free market lets good institutions and regulations emerge better than through governmental institutions.
In the case of Bitcoin, the problem is that bitcoiners want to start from scratch, so they ignore centuries of evolution of banking and trust Mt. Gox (not *all* of them, though).
Regarding the financial crisis, it's more complex than that. It's not so much due to a lack of regulation; finance is actually quite regulated. It's pretty much due to the fact that innovation initially blows up (it's true for planes, trains, etc.) Complex financial engineering is useful but we're making mistakes, initially.
@_date: 2014-03-30 08:32:59
It's not automatically suspicious.
Once you know your customer, you can set a baseline about what their transactions should look like.
If it's a small business (say, a garage), it's fine if they regularly bring USD. But if one day they start bringing in huge amounts of Mexican pesos, yet the business is based in Seattle, maybe you flag the transaction as suspicious.

They're investment analysts. It's their job, for their customers, to carefully weigh the pros and cons of any possible investment. They have to be skeptical about Bitcoin.
Bitcoin isn't a threat to anything by the way... Maybe Paypal, but I wouldn't even bet on that. Paypal could release Paycoin and instantly acquire millions of users, rendering Bitcoin useless.
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:11:33
I'm not sure you understand what a stable price is.
If you have consistent 2% inflation, then prices are very stable. In fact, most large currencies are very stable.
Bitcoin is crazily unstable, it can swing double digits in mere days, back and forth. Which is the reason why no one actually prices anything in Bitcoin; they price in USD, and convert to BTC on the fly. The price will change between when you put the item in your cart and when you pay.
@_date: 2014-03-30 08:20:10
There's a downward trend because the price movements of Bitcoin are 100% speculative since there is absolutely no fundamental you can use to compute the fair value of a bitcoin.
It might as well go up, then down again, then up again and so on. Which, incidentally, is precisely what it's doing.

How, exactly?
If you have fixed supply you will have crazy swings depending on money demand. Especially since there's no fair value whatsoever.
@_date: 2014-03-30 08:37:22
No, it's not (in any case your 357% figure is wrong).
The bank processed $680 billion. That's neither revenue nor profit. The revenue is based on fees (a fraction of that). Now, all of that wasn't laundering. But, because they didn't monitor, a fraction of that amount was used for laundering.
So the fine is actually fairly large (which is the goal, to dissuade other banks from failing their AML requirements).
@_date: 2014-03-29 05:54:55
You're an astute observer.
Does that invalidate what I'm saying?
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:27:04
1) Bitcoin was not designed to get anyone out from under the government. Neither Satoshi nor the core developers of Bitcoin said anything about that.

Please give evidence (such as statistics, figures) explaining how it is ineffective.
Just because some people still manage to do money laundering doesn't mean it's ineffective.
There are still robberies, so are you saying the current legislation doesn't work to prevent robberies?

That's why Bitcoin is so great. Paypal has high costs of operation: they need to pay for reliable hardware, redundancy, backup systems, security, and more importantly qualified personnel, with expertise in software development, security and network operations.
With Bitcoin you don't need any of that, which is why Mt. Gox was able to have much lower fees.
@_date: 2014-03-29 07:12:48
So euphoric.
Listen, I'm a libertarian myself. Why do we libertarians promote free markets? The moral argument is that individual freedom is good, and free markets tend to make people freer. The utilitarian argument is that, in the long run, the free market let the best solutions emerge.
This doesn't mean that what the government does is necessarily bad or stupid. Central banking is also the result of an evolutionary process. It's entirely possible that it took the government longer to figure out that solution, due to inefficiency. But it doesn't mean it's a bad outcome per se, just because it emerged from government institutions.
The problem with Bitcoin is that many proponents want to repeat the mistakes of the past. That's exactly what we're seeing with the unregulated exchanges blowing up. Regulation isn't bad. There are good regulations emerging from the free market, and good ones emerging from governments. And bad ones emerging from the market, and bad ones emerging from the government. Again, the argument is that free market is a better environment to evolve institutions, not that every outcome is good, or that every government outcome is bad.
@_date: 2014-03-29 04:23:34
By that definition then Bitcoin is one of the most unstable currency there is (short of hyper-inflating ones).
Regarding the first point, in an inflation-targeting monetary policy, long-run inflation is stable. It's growing but, again, the long-run growth rate is stable.
Bitcoin will never, ever be as stable as fiat currency for that very reason. This is a very basic result of control theory.

You can value yuan using PPP/UIP. To some extent Bitcoin is like gold, yes, considering that gold is very speculative as an investment, and has no real fair value (there's a low fundamental component of the price based on the price of its substitutes, for industrial use, and a large speculative part of the price).

The fair value of a stock is the net present value of its future dividends (even though you can't actually know, you can certainly estimate it).

Generally, there is definitely less regulation if you don't hold real money.
However, you're still potentially holding people's property. Obviously this depends from the jurisdiction, but generally the normal laws applying to any business apply. Mainly, that the property in question (bitcoins or dogecoins or whatever) doesn't belong to you, and you can't borrow it or use it in any way.
So if, say, you start a bitcoin to dogecoin exchange and you use the bitcoins deposited for your own benefit, that would be illegal in most jurisdictions.
I think you might be sued in a civil court if you fail to take sensible precautions (in terms of security, etc.)
In any case, I'm not a lawyer.

They give stuff value based on how they perceive the value of goods and services in relation to each other (indifference curves, that's economics 101). They know their wage, and how much effort goes into buying stuff: one loaf of bread, carrots, a car, etc.
That's not what happens in Bitcoin, though. People value Bitcoin based on what people value Bitcoin, based on what people value Bitcoin. It's fully circular, entirely speculative.
No one has given me what their own valuation of a Bitcoin is. They all say the following:
Oh, the price is what people set. It's just the result of individual actors deciding what the price should be!
Then, as an individual actor in Bitcoin, please give me what *your* valuation of Bitcoin is. Since the current valuation is nothing but the sum of your individual valuations.

I'm not a republican, nor a conservative (I'm not American, if that matters).

But this idea that libertarianism = being against the state is not constructive. Being libertarian is about finding the institutions maximizing individual freedom. Sometimes the government can help. Sometimes it goes against it. It depends on how it's organized.
The von Mises Institute claims intellectual heritage from Hayek or Bastiat. They were not against government. Are they sell-outs too, who grant legitimacy to the institution of statism?

You don't seem to understand how markets work. Yes, value is subjective and defined by what people think it's worth. But usually they have some sort of valuation model. They compare it to a similar asset, etc.

It's driven by absolutely nothing.
Unlike proper investments that you can value using a dividend discount model (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) or commodities.
It's driven by what the marginal propensity to invest of the average Bitcoin user. So they end up with one Bitcoin = $500. There's absolutely no reason for that, though. One Bitcoin could be worth $5000000 or $0.00000001.
In the long run, the value of 1 BTC is zero.

The conclusion is that all talk based on Bitcoin going up, or down, or to $300 or back to $1200 is based on absolutely nothing. Peanuts. Nada.
Interestingly, the current price is a very 'psychological' one. It's a nice number (whether $30 or $1200).
But why isn't a Satoshi worth $50? Bitcoin would work the same way. It would be as useful as a system.
So, in the long run, the current valuation is supported by absolutely nothing. The Bitcon technology might be great, but that doesn't justify in any way the fact that a single Bitcoin is worth $30 or $700.
Ultimately, it will crash to zero.

This doesn't mean they won't invest in *companies* selling crypto-currency technology and services. But that's an entirely different thing.

This doesn't apply to Bitcoin since nothing is actually priced in Bitcoins. Everything is priced in USD and converted on the fly. I.e. Bitcoin is not an actual currency.

This makes a lot of sense, and would make the exchange rate fixed. The bank just sets one Bankcoin to be 1USD, and they have to provide change in both directions at any time (not unlike a currency board works).

I understand that.
So I guess a Zetacoin should be worth $1,000,000 according to your argument.

I wasn't aware of that research.
One of the co-authors is called Mr. Fiat :)
I like their system better than Bitcoin, I'll have to read that paper.

Those bits, among others, I found pretty euphoric:








So people who disagree with you are 'brainwashed shills" who do "statist pseudo-science", they "worship government institutions", they "lack empathy and intellect", they are "deluded".
I find it interesting because a common tenet of libertarianism is modesty; the idea that we don't know for sure what the best institutions are, what the best way to do something is (which is why we believe in the market as a tool to let the best solutions appear). But you definitely seem to know better than anyone else. So maybe we don't need libertarianism, after all. Sheeple should just be ruled by a know-it-all like you.

So basically, Bitcoins have value because people hoard them. Not because you can burn Bitcoins for energy, not because you can eat them, or look at them. No, just because people hoard them.
Seems like a great 'investment' you have here, totally not a speculative bubble with no fundamental value whatsoever...

1) You don't know anything about my beliefs (I'm a libertarian, if that matters)
2) It's not about the money being 'dirty'. It's about catching criminals. I get my money from ATMs, and from transfers from my bank account. Clearly, it's clean money as far as I'm concerned. However, it's my bank's job to ensure they follow AML regulations.

As anyone seen an scrypt ASIC yet?
The whole point of scrypt is to be useless on an ASIC.
If you want an ASIC-proof POW, you basically need something that requires many branches and requires addressing a lot of memory.

They're not trying to earn bitcoins, they're trying to earn USD.
They'll have a pretty fixed position in bitcoins.

If the entire world used bitcoin as a store of value and currency, then you'd have something that looks like the gold standard (probably stronger than the gold standard, actually).
The problem is that:
1) You can't reach that point in the first place
2) Bitcoin wouldn't scale to that point anyway
Now you can argue that next generations of crypto-currency will solve the scalability problem (perhaps by removing the centralized ledger). But you still face the problem of adoption.

I've never seen a hardware manufacturer say something different. "Yes, absolutely, it's definitely available and shipping right now. We do express shipping under 12 months, that's correct."

This gives you the most economically free countries: 
It's not that they don't have governments. They just have less intervention of government in economic matters.
It's hard to argue that the top countries are bad countries to live in. Take Switzerland, New Zealand, Canada and Australia. Those countries are at the top of most rankings of quality of life.
Singapore and Hong Kong are less balanced. They're more economically free, but less free in other aspects (e.g. there is very little press freedom in Singapore). They're still good places to live, I think.
Now, regarding the crisis, it's a combination of many issues. There was clearly bad behavior in banks, but also bad incentives created by government.
I agree that things would be very bad in a world with no regulation. That's not the issue. The question is: how do we find the good regulations? It might well be that the market is a better way. This doesn't mean we don't need governments. But perhaps a good way is to have government set fundamental principles and enforce the law (i.e. enforce contracts and property rights), and let institutions emerging from the market defining the details. Which is, to some extent, the way it works at the moment.

The article was not written by filthy rich bankers, but by financial analysts/economic researchers.
2. Bitcoin is volatile because there is literally nothing anchoring its value anywhere. Its $500 but it might well be $3,000 or $2.3. Please, tell me what's the fair value of 1 Bitcoin?
3. A central bank has never increased the value for the holders of a currency. Inflation is *designed* in the system (at least for central bank having an inflation targeting policy, which is most of them). Currency isn't an investment asset. When has a bicycle ever been able to go underwater? Well, my submarine can!!

I think a mistake people make is that they assume government is progressively good (or bad). As a linear thing. It's more like something with a dose effect (perhaps like a vaccine).
Having no government at all is bad (case in point: Somalia). Having a limited but strong government is good (case in point: Switzerland). Having big government that controls everything is also bad (case in point: Venezuela or Cuba).

It's. Not. A. STOCK!!!
If that's what you think, invest in Bitcoin companies. The price of a coin is irrelevant to the success of Bitcoin.

I think the fact Bitcoin's designer never intended it as a store of value in the first place might be relevant to the parent poster's predicament.

That's not quite how valuation works...
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:49:10
That fundamental equation you're looking for is the one of the dividend discount model. You then need to build a valuation model on top of it. That's what financial analysts do.

You're completely fucking delusional if you think Wall Street is interested in buying bitcoins from a bunch of kids. If they can't value it, it has no value.
A few nobodies are starting investment funds and the like, precisely to capitalize on the gullible ("when there's a gold rush, start selling shovels"). You're getting fleeced by smart money (and, no, you're not smart money).
All your estimates about $100, $200, whatever are based on absolutely nothing. Do you think that's how it works on the Street? No, people look at fundamentals to try to get to a fair value. Then they buy or sell depending on that value.
Here I only see people saying "It's going to be worth X because {china, IRS, whatever}". Where does that X comes from? Why would it be worth $1000 and not $30? Why not 679855$? You have absolutely no idea what the price of a coin should be.

How is SEK3 more relevant than Bastiat? Who gets to decide who is a 'real' libertarian, anyway?
Maybe I sold out, but I find it more interesting to try to reform existing governments to be more libertarian rather than arguing about hypothetical agorist utopias on the Internet...

Isn't the whole point of scrypt to be memory intensive in order not to make it possible to profitably implement on an FPGA, ASIC or GPU?
edit: ah, indeed that's literally the first sentence in the scrypt paper: "We introduce the concepts of memory-hard algorithms and sequential memory-hard functions, and argue that in order for key derivation functions to be maximally secure against attacks using custom hardware, they should be constructed from sequential memory-hard functions."
Now, the use case is slightly different here, because supposedly you're just looking for an edge. But still.

They don't know. They don't even know if laundering actually happened (although it's quite likely).
The fine is for not following the AML legislation.

No, you're dead wrong.
To start with, a fair exchange rate for the Argentine peso can be defined based on money supply, interest rates and purchasing power parity with other currencies. This is precisely why there's a black market rate and an official one. People didn't decide to set a different rate just for fun. It's because there is a fundamental rate.
This still doesn't answer my question re. Bitcoin. What's *your* fair value for a Bitcoin. You're saying it's set by individual actors in the free market. Fine, please tell me what's your valuation of a single Bitcoin. Why do you think it's X? And why not Y? Why do you think it's $700?
