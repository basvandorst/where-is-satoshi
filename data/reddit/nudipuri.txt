For the last few years there has been a lot of debate about how bitcoin should scale to accommodate the large increase in the number of transactions per day it could process, as at times it was hitting this limit. There were essentially two different camps on how this should be done: the "segwit" camp, and the "increase blocksize to 2mb" camp. Segwit2x was a combination of these with both an implementation of segwit and a corresponding increase to 2mb block size (the 2x stands for 2mb block size, as this was a doubling of blocksize (i.e. 2x)). So the debate isn't really about segwit at all, it is just about whether now that we have segwit, do we also need the 2x (increase in block size). In principal many people supported the concept of segwit and a blocksize increase, but thought the blocksize increase shouldn't be rushed and rather should go through the rigorous testing and debate before implemented. Also, the community of developers that has so far been responsible for developing bitcoin, had technical concerns regarding an increase in blocksize. The segwit2x crowd believe this to be unnecessary, and so have developed seperate software that implements this feature. But the way that this has been done, alone with the way this has been debated has caused quite a large divide in the community (users, developers, businesses and miners combined). This has caused alot of misinformation to be spread about the pros and cons of each.
Personally, I'm on the side of the fence that thinks any increase in block size shouldn't be rushed, but rather designed, developed and tested in a slow rigorous manner. So any further information I could provide would really be just arguing for this case
