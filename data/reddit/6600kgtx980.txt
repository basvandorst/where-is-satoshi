If he accepted Bitcoin for his Album using Bitpay how does he claim to have bitcoin. 
does this mean louis ck also has millions he doesn't know about from 2014/2015 when he was accepting bitcoin?
P.S Your Welcome.

whenever I go into that Culver City Mall i'm sure to park near that entrance I put on my hoodie , I go up to the machine , scan the phone insert the $100's  and I get out as quick as possible , it adds to the mystique if anyone happens to be standing around they will wonder wtf that guy is doing.. and what is a 'hero coin'
The Purchase fee is not so bad. the Selling fee is a lot more. maybe even double
Silver Trash Can , Kids play area , Black hanger , dirty floors , Yellow Wells Fargo ATM.
It's gotta be Culver City.

it's just a refresh issue , a few mins later that 4,006 price did update and the sell price was indeed 4,006 , 
imo its still an issue if someone didnt notice the 'btc price' and the 'btc price' from one screen to the next is different .
fuck it 3 upvotes / and getting down voted. its fine. i guess its not an issue till its a scam

i did post on r/gemini but 22 people active in the place it will never be seen 
open app Btc price $4,006
click Btc - price is $3800
Sell max btc @ $3800 value? wtf
Btc price shows 4,006 on Blockfolio
Gemini skimming $200 for the lols?
i'm NOT selling btw.. this just seems like it needs attention from Gemini.. and it's users

it was Andreas Antonopoulos that set it up for him ,  before Y.J was the on scene producer , it was Redban , on that episode they made the wallet , and redban did as well (he has $440 in his wallet still)
what Joe did was / or at least says he did was accept donations to that address , and then he would match it and donate to fight for the forgotten , but in the end he just kept the bitcoin in the wallet and donated out of pocket.. or did he? lets just assume he did.. 
which makes me think he has no idea he still holds 5+ bitcoins.  and he simply forgot.
joe probably set that wallet address up on his galaxy s6, or some 'old' phone that he no longer has , who knows  really

Bots.. hmm alright , probably the correct answer , thanks.
I watched it hit $2950.47 on Gemini , then get pounded by 2 separate 45 btc orders then 5-6 more 7.5 orders and it dropped pretty good instantly from $2950 - $2880 
it's hypnotic watching the numbers
