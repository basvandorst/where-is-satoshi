You guys got way off topic. Voorhees in this [video]( answers the question on how bitcoin will change the world in a mainstream way. "Currency is a monopoly. People don't like monopolies. Bitcoin breaks that monopoly." Everyone can get behind this idea. Not many people want to change their minds. They'd much rather be entertained by CNN and John Oliver than read an economics book. FIND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN AGREE UPON

Dude, his project that he is promoting is shape shift which is coin agnostic. Bitcoin was used as the example

Exactly, people may turn to cleaning out the fed or more regulation.

The natural formation that 80% of the wealth is owned by 20% of the people? If you try to control it, doesn't this statistic worsen?

Why not have Monero as the base layer since it is private
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:18:20
Its not an attack. Monero is fundamentally better

Not really, electric cars is a substitute good. Your analogy would work if they wished asic mining became the de facto standard. Cars dying decreases the demand for the good and thus price.

If you don't have much savings why is it in bitcoin?

If it was all on the bitcoin blockchain I could

Please don't have xmr and shitcoin in the same sentence

fluffy pony is a troll, its actually pretty obvious. Just because of this doesn't mean he doesn't care about privacy and keeping peoples money safe. And btw, he advocates decentralization of developers. So that if he becomes a target one day someone else can step-up.

Monero %90, bitcoin %10. Bitcoin you're buying a brand. Monero you're buying utility and freedom

Bitcoin may not even be around in 20 years. Could be a different cryptocurrency. It is our choice of which crypto survives. Compare your options and make sure you support the one with the highest universal utility.

Spoken like a true american, ++1 for regulation and regulatory capture. Great things happen such as the dismantling of net neutrality.

My dorm freshman year of college had electricity built into the rent.. Non-variable. Never mined though.

Wouldn't any cryptocurrency allow for the modification of the block size? The hashes that are used to verify block integrity work with any block size, so that's not the barrier.

But with increases of demand, new competitors will enter the market. All the competitors do their best to decrease their marginal cost(efficiency of production). Thus supply will increase in the long run which will negate the original increase in demand. And efficiency and technology advances will be the by product.

In the long run everyone is better off. The long run is what is important
