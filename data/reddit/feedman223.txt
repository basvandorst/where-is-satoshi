So if you want to buy Bitcoin right after it crashes, and you use a bank account, you have to wait 5 days ish for it to process? You could lose so much money.

Ohhh I see. Can you buy from gdax by bank account and get whatever price it was at the time (since you will be saving money from the lower taxes on gdax compared to coinbase)?

What is a hardware wallet? Also, why transfer Bitcoin? It seems easier to keep it in an account where I can sell it whenever I want to. 
P.S. When I sell Bitcoin, where does the money go? PayPal? Bank account?

Ahh I see. I watched a video on the fees (1.5% for Coinbase, .3% or 0% depending for gdax) and I realize the usefulness of it. Should I then buy Bitcoin on Gdax and not use Coinbase at all?
Also, a semi related question, how does the time that you need to wait for money to be deposited onto your account or to sell Bitcoin from your account differ for the websites?

I looked into gdax, and I understand it is good for trading, but how does that differ from buying and selling? Why move Bitcoin over there, when I can do the same thing in Coinbase?

Yeah that makes sense! Thanks for all the help with questions lol.

You said that if you buy bitcoin on coin base, with a bank account, it will buy how ever much bitcoin you want at that price, regardless of how long the funds take to get to your account. Meaning that even if bitcoin falls or rises you will receive the amount you paid for. Is it the same way for gdax? Can you purchase a certain amount and get it regardless of waiting for funds to transfer from the bank to gdax?
