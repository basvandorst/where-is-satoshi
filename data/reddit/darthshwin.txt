Looking at this graph makes me curious: what’s to stop someone from opening an crypto exchange where you can short fiat currencies but not withdraw them. Instead of buying BTC-USD, you could short USD-BTC. Seems like you’d be able to avoid regulatory issues since deposits/withdrawals would be in crypto.

starting from your coinbase dashbaord, go to Tools&gt;Addresses. Select "BTC Wallet" from the drop down menu, and it will show you all your bitcoin addresses. These are like your bank account numbers. They are safe to give out to others, but you still shouldn't be giving them out to someone unless you need them to send you bitcoins. Once someone has one of those addresses, they can send you bitcoins; note that they only need one of the addresses to pay you.

True, increasing divisibility is the choice with fewer repercussions. But increasing divisibility means increasing the size of the 64-bit Satoshis-to-send field in the transaction output. Where does that end? That makes transactions bigger which means miners will resist, and while miners don’t control bitcoin, it means increasing divisibility is not going to be without its battles.

If you really need it to go through, then I think there’s replace-by-fee (admittedly, I don’t know very much about this). If it’s a transfer to another wallet you own, or there’s no rush for some other reason, then you can rest assured that after 2 weeks the coins go back to the sending address.

SegWit is a soft-fork; that means it "plays nice" with non-SegWit bitcoin wallets. SegWit also mainly focuses on cutting down the size of a transaction input, which means that it makes a bigger difference where you send FROM, not where you send TO. Sending FROM a SegWit wallet requires less data on the blockchain than sending FROM a legacy wallet. But in either of those cases, it won't make much of a difference (in terms of fees) what type of wallet you're sending TO.
Since GDAX covers your withdrawal fee, you don't really notice any difference for this particular transaction.

one of the biggest things is that Tether is a cryptocurrency in the eyes of the IRS. AFAIK, you don't pay taxes if you sell you cryptos for Tether. You'd only pay taxes if you converted the Tethers to USD or spent them directly.

Between GDAX &amp; Coinbase, GDAX is better.
Of all possible options, leaving coins on GDAX is on the "bad" end of the spectrum namely because you don't control the keys to your bitcoin; what you have is an IOU from the company for however many bitcoins. If the company goes bankrupt (however unlikely that may be) your IOU will be worth nothing. (USD wallet balances are FDIC insured so you're safe for up to $250K, but bitcoins enjoy no such protection).
If it's a small enough amount that if you lost it you wouldn't be sad for more than a day, then GDAX is probably safe enough. If it's enough money that you'd lose sleep over it, invest in a hardware wallet when you can. Some options are listed on bitcoin.org
You can deposit/withdraw fiat &amp; crypto directly to GDAX, so once you have your GDAX account up and running, there's rarely ever a need to use Coinbase again.

If you leave your coins with an exchange, then it's up to them to give you your forked coins. They may give it to you (more or less) instantly, like HitBTC did on the BTG fork, or they may take their sweet ass time, like Coinbase is with BCH. If you have the private keys to your coins, then you have to send the forked coins to an exchange (which requires replay protection to avoid losing your BTC) and sell them for whatever you like. Replay protection is not required if you keep your coins on the exchange though, since the exchange will typically split them for you. There are pros and cons either way; if you're not super savvy with the technicals of bitcoin, you should put your coins on an exchange a day or 2 before the fork.

I get that this is a fine line, but if 21M goes, then it’d be safe to call the bitcoin experiment failed.
And the whole point of having a lifetime longer than a person is that you’re not stealing.

I personally did not get a HW wallet until my crypto was dozens of times more valuable than the wallet itself.
I'd say anything below $500 is safe enough on an exchange, and anything below $1k is safe on a mobile wallet. I've used Breadwallet &amp; Jaxx, and I've heard good things about GreenAddress on this sub. 
Mobile phones are a lot less virus prone than desktops/laptops, especially Windows machines. But they're not fool proof so don't be putting millions of dollars on your mobile wallet.

Yes. Shorting futures when you own the underlying assets is a way to protect against price drops. However, the exact amount you short will depend on your risk tolerance and the amount of BTC you have.

Best way to go IMO is to create an account in his name that you have the password to. You can manage everything, but there will be a clear separation of what’s yours and what’s his. You can hold coins on your HW wallet with no worries as long as you keep track of how much is his.

Those pros that you hear are regarding transactions within the bitcoin protocol (ie only bitcoin involved). When you are dealing with fiat, the issuing government of the fiat makes you jump through hoops for KYC/AML.
Bitcoin is (almost) anonymous, and a cheap* way to transact money. Caveat with cheap: yes fees are high right now due to an influx of users, but devs are addressing this issue via SegWit (already available) &amp; Lightning Network (upcoming).

People doing this, arbitrage, are the “spill over” of supply from kraken. But if there’s not enough people doing it, the price difference can persist. Over time this will disappear as more people do arbitrage; the larger the price difference, the more profitable (and less risky) arbitrage is.

I think a good compromise between not confusing newbies &amp; seeing more manageable numbers is for price trackers to give to options of pricing for BTC, mBTC, μBTC &amp; Satoshi, with the default being BTC.

Online wallets are not ideal in terms of security. If you can, use an offline wallet.
That being said, transferring your coins to an online wallet is a transaction like any other. If you know the private keys to your coins, you can import them to wallet software to send a transaction.

AKAIK, the answers are:
1) no tax on withdrawals/deposits if the addresses you're transferring from &amp; to are both yours.
2) each trade, and the gains are calculated in FIFO order only.
3) when you pay someone in crypto, the IRS treats it like selling at market price and then paying with the cash proceeds. 
4) see  because you're paying someone with bitcoin.
5) as of their 2014-21 notice, the IRS treats crypto as commodities (like precious metals).

The way fees work in the raw bitcoin protocol is that the inputs have a total value of X satoshis &amp; the outputs have a total value of Y satoshis. The amount the recipient gets is Y satoshis &amp; the fee paid is X-Y satoshis. So the tl;dr is that the amount you specify to send is the amount the recipient gets; fees you pay are on top of that amount, not deducted from it. Keep in mind that this is the bitcoin protocol; your wallet software may vary (but they’ll typically do the same as the core protocol)
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:09:10
Both. In the particular case of GDAX, they don't charge for withdrawals (fiat or crypto) either, but that's not common across exchanges. In general, deposits are free no matter what you're depositing.

if you're talking about the 12-24 word recovery phrase, its not stored anywhere.
Computers are deterministic systems, so they suck at generating truly random numbers (like private keys). They need a seed to generate random numbers. If you use those words as a seed for the private key generator, you'll get the same "random" private keys every time. Which is why you should never share your recovery phrase with anyone.

If you had bitcoin with Coinbase on Aug 1, 2017, then that bcash is your forked coin. You can keep it or sell it, but it is very much yours and not a coding error.
If you didn’t have any bitcoin with Coinbase on that date, then it could be a glitch, or someone may have accidentally sent you bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:40:31
You could. It is called arbitrage &amp; it’s completely legal. The only catch is that you have to hope that the Coinbase price doesn’t drop before your transfer completes. With large price differences, this risk is not very big.

I get the slippery slope, but each change to the “lifetime” of a UTXO would require new consensus.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:32:25
As Andreas Antonopoulos said (in some video or another): soft-forks can only make consensus rules stricter, hard-forks are required to make consensus rules more relaxed.
The way that LN works is by using special scripts in transactions; theses scripts are already supported by full nodes, so you don't have to add any new functionality, you just use what's already there in a specific way. Nodes running older software will see that the new transactions' signatures check out, and will mark them as valid.
Block size increases require a hard-fork because the bigger blocks would get rejected by nodes running old software. Decreasing block size can be done by soft-fork because there is currently no minimum block size, so nodes running old software won't reject smaller blocks.

There isn't much of a correlation between how much bitcoin you have and how many keys you have. Imagine a room with 2^80 safe deposit boxes each with a transparent door. You can see what's in any box, but you can't take it out without the key for that box.
 You create a key at random, and find the box that it fits (the encryption behind bitcoin makes finding a lock easy if you have a key, and makes finding the key very hard if you only have the lock). Now if you have 1 key, all you coins are the box that key is for, but if you have 2 keys, then your coins can be in some ratio between the 2 boxes. Every time you get coins, you create a new key because whoever is sending you coins knows which box they're sending to, and that it belongs to you.
You could have 1 box with 10BTC while another may only have 10Sat. "Your" bitcoin is the total coins in all the boxes that you have the keys for.

“Infinitely divisible” is not exactly the case though. UTXOs contain the number of Satoshis to send as a 64-bit integer. To add more digits you’d have to multiply the values of older transactions by some power of 10. This would end up as a hard fork between the nodes with more decimal digits and the nodes with 8.

Who would oppose it? I don’t think miners would as they’d stand to profit the most. And while users benefit from a decreasing supply, eventually lost bitcoins will cause insufficient divisibility.

Removing middlemen gives you more freedom, but that comes with more responsibility. In your scenario, it would be your responsibility to double check the amount before confirming payment. In the future there may be some bitcoin "banks" that serve the same role they do today for bitcoin transactions (for people that don't want the extra responsibility), but in that scenario, all middlemen will be optional; you'll be still able to to interact with the world economy without them if you're willing to take the extra responsibility.

I tried changing a single character in my BTC address and looking it up on a block explorer; I got an “invalid” address error.

Why are USD valuable? Because everyone has faith that you can trade them for the things you need to stay alive &amp; live comfortably.

Bitcoin is highly divisible, but not infinitely so, as the Satoshis-to-send field needs to be able to store the total number or Satoshis there will ever be. Right now that number is 2.1 quadrillion and fits in 64bits (which maxes out at 18.4 quintillion).  As long as 21M BTC is the total supply, then you can increase the number of “V2 Satoshis” in the system to whatever number you want without inflation. But doing so increases the data needed in the transaction outputs, so you can’t do it infinitely.

Anyone that says “blockchain but not bitcoin” doesn’t understand either.
Let’s start with how it would work for the banksters’ wet dream, a private blockchain. Well it’d have to be distributed to a few firewalled servers because that’s how blockchains work; if all the data is in one server then you’re back to using databases. But oh wait, now each server has a copy of the private data so all it takes is for one server to get hacked and all this private data is now out in the open. 
Ok fine let’s make it a public blockchain that anyone can see, but only the bank’s private servers can mine (ie add data). Well that’s great, but how do they make sure no one else can add blocks? Whether it’s a password or some other form of shared secret, it’s still a central point of failure which we’ve seen to be insecure time and time again.
Ok so let’s make it public &amp; open. What’s the incentive for anyone to mine? There has to be some form of positive/negative reinforcements for following the rules otherwise everyone would write incorrect data for their own benefit. 
So now you have a public, open, decentralized blockchain with a reward system for the miners who follow the rules..... this is starting to sound like bitcoin.
Now the question is: if you have a public &amp; open system, how can you control it? You can’t control read access, because we showed above that that won’t work. You can’t control write access, because we also showed above that that won’t work. So you have a database that that you can’t control read or write access? Sounds like you can’t control it.
TL;DR: see first sentence.

The people that say to keep all your coins in offline storage are typically only going one way, i.e. they buy, and transfer coins to their offline storage. If you're going to be trading more frequently once a week, I'd keep some coins on the exchange wallet.  Yes there is some risk of the exchange going under and you losing your coins, but unless you're an **experienced** day-trader, you should be fully prepared to lose the coins you trade with. Until decentralized exchanges become more common this is just one of the risks you'll have to live with.

The eli5 answer is this: just like a car varies in price from dealer to dealer. 
$1000 is about 6% which is actually not an abnormal difference to see.
Arbitrage is one way that different markets get their prices equalize; if there’s more supply on kraken, some of that supply can “spill over” into gdax to meet the extra demand on gdax. The only thing stopping this is that while waiting for a transfer from kraken to gdax so you can sell higher in gdax than you bought in kraken, the price on gdax may drop below what you paid on kraken. Volatility is what makes arbitrage risky. That and transfer fees.

Hash rate is a measure of the computing power involved in mining. More hash power = higher mining difficulty = more security for the blockchain.

Imagine a fantasy world where you could open a bank account just with a chosen username &amp; password. No email, no ID, no phone  etc. Now I’m this fantasy world, the bank posts all transactions online for all to see, but of course they only know which username sent how much money to which other username; they don’t know who the people are associated with those usernames. That’s why Bitcoin is pseudonymous: you are not directly tied to your payments. 
Let’s look at another example in this fantasy world: you pay rent to your landlord every month. Your landlord will know your username because it’s the one paying him every month. And since all transactions are posted by username, now he knows all the transactions you’ve ever made. There are mechanisms to get around this in Bitcoin, but if you’re careless like in the example, then your landlord (or others) can trace transactions to you.
Bitcoin is like this fantasy world, except instead of a bank, everyone’s transaction history is the blockchain, managed by the network of all the users’ computers.

Why is it that full nodes don’t reject empty blocks as invalid? Yes, the empty blocks may follow consensus rules, but they are not providing any security or function for Bitcoin (as a currency, since they do not add new transactions to the blockchain) so why do they deserve the block reward?
EDIT1 : only reject blocks when there is a “significant” number of unconfirmed transactions. “
What “significant” means must be uniform across the the network but is open to interpretation 
EDIT2: I guess my proposal requires a minimum hold time for the mempool; if the are a “significant” number of transactions younger than this minimum hold time, reject empty blocks. The minimum hold time and the definition of “significant” would need to be (more or less) uniform across all nodes for this to work, but they are still yet to be defined in concrete numbers

With &gt;50% of the hash power, any entity/organization can control what transactions get added to the blockchain. If they can maintain that level of hash power for an extended period of time, they can undo transactions and effectively steal money from you (if it’s money you received recently).
In general, no one can take your bitcoin without your consent unless they know your private key, or they break ECDSA public/private key security (The latter is much less likely to occur, at least in the near future).
The big thing about a 51% attack (or any of the most catastrophic attacks) is that it’d be quickly detected, and 1 of 2 things would happen.
- PoW change, which would render all current mining equipment more or less useless (this requires consensus, but nothing unites a divided house better than an outside attack)
- Everyone would ditch bitcoin in favor of a more secure crypto (this would be more likely if it’s a completely lost cause to keep using bitcoin, which is fairly unlikely, at least in the near future)

While bitcoin does make money more democratic, it does nothing in the short term about wealth inequality. I’m fairly sure this is by design, as the wealthy would never get on board otherwise. In the long term, consensus rules may be able to pull the other way, but I’m not sure how much of an effect it will have.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:15:58
To be clear, my definition of censorship resistance is resistance to disapproval by anyone; government is the obvious one, but in your example, the developer could ban transactions from/to a certain person, the score on your scale would still be 0. 
In the particular case of Bitcoin, the censorship resistance score is a measure of how centralized mining is; the more centralized, the closer to 0 the score is.
If independent miners represent more than k% of the hash power, then there is almost always at least a k% chance of your transaction getting confirmed. That is your safety net if mining pools start ignoring your transactions.

The fear here stems from the fact that (iirc) you can get 40% more BTC by buying directly from an exchange. That’s not to say that GBTC is useless; you can buy it with retirement money and you don’t have to worry about security for your coins. But that ends up being a custodial account, which is exactly what BTC was designed to avoid.

They can reverse transactions (that’s how double spending would be done) it’s just that the longer ago a transaction happened, the harder it is to reverse.

Censorship resistance (as I define it) is the ability for someone to make/receive payments regardless of whether or not governments approve of said transactions. In the ideal case of bitcoin (or any mineable cryptocurrency) all that is needed for you to be able to send/receive payment is the willingness of at least 1 miner to include the aforementioned transaction.  Realistically you’d need more (to confirm you transaction within a reasonable amount of time) but as long as there is a non-negligible percentage of miners willing to add your transactions to their blocks, your transactions are censorship-resistant.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:20:28
Since right now a vast majority of people in any given country have fiat &amp; earn fiat, the simplest way for governments to slow down bitcoin is to over-regulate  the exchanges to the point that they are no longer able to function well.
For banks, it’s a bit trickier because they don’t have de jure authority. But with the de facto power they wield, they can mark all ACH transactions &amp; wires involving known exchanges as “suspicious” and make them take a lot longer. This will definitely slow adoption in such a volatile market where timing is everything.
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:13:23
Yea, if I’m not mistaken (feel free to correct me) it’s just as hard to mine an empty block as a “full” block. This means that anyone who mines a “less-than-full” block is trying to keep low-fee transactions off the chain. Forcing blocks that are at least 75% capacity (or some other percentage) would allow low-
fee transactions to get confirmed faster
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:52:13
Probably wire transfer if you’re willing to eat those fees

The mechanism I mentioned in my previous comment is that you create a new public key for every transaction. This way the pk is tied to you, but it’s not tied to anything else. So nothing but the “buy something online” transaction is tied to your physical address. Now if that “something” is illegal in and of itself, then you’re in a bit of a pickle. But if you’re a law abiding citizen (or if you don’t tie transactions involving illegal things directly to you) then you’ll have a fair degree of anonymity 
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:47:14
People always spew the garbage about bitcoin having centralized development, but because the protocol is open source, literally anyone with decent programming ability can write their own implementation to compete with bitcoin core. Nobody has afaik because there’s no need to fix something that isn’t broken. If bitcoin core gets an upgrade or protocol change you don’t like, you can write your own and publish it.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:41:49
When you create a transaction, you pay to the HASH of a public key (nowadays; in the early days of bitcoin you paid to the public key directly). This is abbreviated P2PKH (vs the original P2PK) and what it means is that the transaction output only contains the hash of your public key; if you pay to a fresh public key with P2PKH, then the actual public key is NOT on the blockchain yet. When that P2PKH output is spent, the public key and signature are put on the blockchain in the script signature of the spending transaction.
What this means for you is that when you reuse a public key, that your public key is already on the blockchain (in its raw form and not as a hash), so to steal your funds, someone only needs to break the ECDSA signature algorithm. When you use a fresh public key, stealing your funds requires someone to break ECDSA, SHA256 &amp; RIPEMD160. Breaking all 3 is harder then just the one. 
Despite the low probability of someone breaking ECDSA, we still protect against it because the cost of protection is basically zero, i.e. using a new public key for every transaction.

Nothing, but because winning the mining “lottery” is pretty random, you’d have to control almost all the hashpower to do so.  The only realistic way to hog the block reward is to restrict the supply of mining equipment so that no one else can get into mining, which is outside the scope of the bitcoin protocol.

They don’t tax you when you spend with USD because that’s the base unit of measure in the US. Other currencies are taxed as capital gains when used as a speculative asset. They only have the spending exception because there’s a sovereign nation pushing them to do so. Since there’s no sovereign in charge of cryptos they don’t get the same courtesy.
As for the state of the tax code, it’d be relatively easy to evade taxes (not that you should) because they want to tax events that generally don’t have much of a paper trail.
Claiming that you lost you keys is a pretty easy way to fake capital losses and it almost impossible to disprove.
I think the IRS is definitely overreaching with the current tax law, but until the representatives in gov get an accurate understanding of the space, they’re not gonna change policy. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:20:37
The situation I described with creating a new implementation of the bitcoin protocol, it’s by no means a pretty picture. Targeting or co-opting developers is a valid concern, but the long-term damage that any single developer can do is limited unless they have the political influence within the crypto community to enforce a malicious protocol change. 
BCH is an example of this where some developers didn’t like the way the BTC was going so they wrote their own implementation. This would have died off like the earlier forks of BTC if not for the fact that they managed to fool a sizable chunk of the crypto community. The ability to convince people that their way is the best way is what is keeping BCH alive.

Yes with a small correction: your bitcoin address is the hash of your public key; they’re not the same thing. Both are relatively safe to expose, but it’s safer to expose the hash/address than the raw public key.

Inflation is when the value of currency decreases relative to the value of the typical things you'd want to buy (e.g. food, shelter, clothes etc.) Deflation is just the opposite; currency increases in value relative to other things.
The value of an item depends on its intrinsic value, and supply &amp; demand. My way of defining intrinsic value (yours may vary) is how much something can make your life longer or more enjoyable. By that definition Bitcoin has no intrinsic value (but neither does any fiat currency or gold or diamonds etc.). Bitcoin has a floating price based on how many people want to buy and how many people want to sell (supply &amp; demand) and that price depends on the current faith that Bitcoin will be able to buy things that make your life longer or more enjoyable in the future; the same applies to fiat currency and precious metals.
The reason that Bitcoin is resistant to inflation is that the total amount of bitcoins in circulation is a function of the blockchain only; no entity can mint new Bitcoins for their own purposes. This makes it similar to gold in that there is a fixed supply at any given time. The algorithm governing Bitcoin creation sets an upper limit of 21M Bitcoins, and releases new Bitcoins into circulation with every new block added to the chain. As long as we the users continue to accept that policy, the price of Bitcoin will be resistant to inflation.
TL;DR: Bitcoin is resistant to inflation because the supply is controlled by an algorithm that has no vested interest in making itself richer.

I you want to BE the escrow service for 2 other parties you’d set up a 2-of-3 multisig in which you have 1 of the 3 private keys. Example below.
Alice wants to sell a house to Bob. Bob would pay the cost of the house to the above 2-of-3 multisig. Alice &amp; Bob each have 1 of the private keys as well. Possible dispute scenarios where Bob doesn’t want to pay for some reason:
- If you agree with Bob, you and Bob sign to refund Bob
- If you agree with Alice, you and Alice sign to pay Alice
If they come to agreement on their own, they have the 2 signatures needed to authorize payment without you

As this video explains, Alice sends you a transaction you can't claim until you pay Bob. So closing the channel at this point without paying Bob would result in Alice getting a refund after the timelock expires (because you'll be unable to spend that TXO)

True, so the hash power may return eventually, but people mining themselves will result in a rather slow climb toward current hash power levels.
However, I don’t imagine people would want to invest in mining hardware either if it can quickly become obsolete. That fear would be around for a while unless we truly achieve decentralized mining, which may not happen as quickly as one would hope.

That’s kinda the “nuclear option” as it damages the bitcoin ecosystem pretty badly too. No company will want to invest in mining hardware if it can be made completely useless with a software upgrade.
Going that route would kill the hash power behind bitcoin (at least temporarily, likely long term too), which means bitcoin loses security for the duration that the hash power is gone.

Yes you can. It’s called “buying on margin”. Typically you can keep the borrowed money as long as you pay interest or some kind of fee.
This definitely is available with stock brokers, but not many crypto exchanges offer it because of the risk involved. You have very few options for buying on margin as an individual. If you got a corporate account with a crypto exchange, you might get different treatment.

When you short bitcoin (or any asset for that matter) you borrow bitcoin from the exchange and sell it. You have to repay that borrowed bitcoin eventually, but you hope that you can buy it at a cheaper rate to repay the loan. In a nutshell, you profit based on the amount of the price drop.
If the price rises, it costs more to repay the loan than you borrowed. Example:
- you short 1 BTC @ $7k
- price rises to $7.5k
Now, to repay the loan of 1 BTC, you have to spend $7.5k, but you only got $7k from the short sell. So you take a loss of $500.
If the price keeps rising, you lose even more money. This is what they mean when they say that your losses with shorting can be unlimited. If you short 1 BTC @ $10k &amp; the price jumps to $100k tomorrow, you need to come up with another $90k  to repay the 1 BTC you borrowed.
In contrast, when you buy 1 BTC at, say $7k, the worst case scenario is that you lose that $7k. You can never lose more than your initial investment.
So basically person A saw a price jump, and decided to cut their losses. They placed a market buy to recover the bitcoin they owe. This caused the price to increase a bit, and person B ended up in this same scenario due to the price jump caused by person A. Rinse &amp; repeat until there’s no one left with a short position who’s scared of the price jump.

In order for the EQUALVERIFY to pass you’d need another public key that hashes to the same address. So basically you’re asking if the are clashes in the HASH160 algorithm. The odds of this happening are 1 in 2^160. This probability is so ridiculously low that it’s 0 for all security purposes.
An analogy: if you could summon a meteor strike with surgical precision you could break into a bank, but the bank doesn’t bother protecting against this type of attack because there’s 0 chance of it happening.

Get some kind of wallet. There are many options, like a dedicated hardware device (hardware wallet) or a mobile application. What is best for you depends on your needs and you can probably get most of the info you need at:
Generate an address you want to use to receive payments, and print its QR code &amp; the address itself. Post this somewhere by the cash register. 
When someone wants to pay with bitcoin, have them send the appropriate amount to that address.
If you want to keep the BTC:
Every so often (e.g. weekly) transfer all payments made to that address you posted to a NEW bitcoin address. This means a new address every however often (every week in my example). Spend from these new addresses as needed.
If you want to get your local currency:
Every so often (e.g. weekly) send all the bitcoin to an exchange &amp; sell the BTC for your local fiat currency, then transfer those proceeds back to your bank. KEEP CAREFUL RECORDS OF ALL YOUR CONVERSIONS TO YOU LOCAL CURRENCY. Not all exchanges provide the necessary tax documents.
If you want an added layer of security/privacy, you should change the BTC address you post by the cash register every time someone uses it. If you do this you don’t need to transfer to new addresses every so often like I mentioned above.
If you use a posted address to receive more than 1 payment, it’s best to transfer those funds into another new BTC address.

When you spend bitcoin you broadcast to the world that you are spending those bitcoins. That broadcast requires data on the blockchain. Space on the blockchain is what your fee pays for.
SegWit is basically data compression (that’s not how it works, but that’s what its effect is). So you need less space on the blockchain, which translates to less fees. You’re still paying the same fee RATE, but you’re buying less space per transaction.

Keep in mind that bitcoin is opt-in unlike fiat currencies. So if the conditions of bitcoin become untenable as in your example, people are free to leave for other crypto, or to go back to fiat, or to create/fork their own crypto. This would eventually result in the devaluation of bitcoin, which decreases the mining cartel’s income.
