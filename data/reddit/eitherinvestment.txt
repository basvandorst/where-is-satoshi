Shit did they? Time to clean my wallet out
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:55:15
DM me. I will teach you in a few minutes and give you some. It’s very easy. The first btc you receive in your first wallet is a very exciting experience! And then off you go. Welcome to the modern financial era.
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:35:05
The first step is always the hardest (or irrationally seems so). Then when you see how easy it is...
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:25:51
What you describe is way more burdensome than the equivalent with Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:26:52
They don’t even have to go this far to easily accept BTC. But great if they do
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:34:55
It was too expensive for atm withdrawals but yeah great to use as visa. We need some better cards. What’s status of revolut, monaco and other alternatives?
@_date: 2019-07-30 13:13:39
Do not sorry.
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:48:37
Your comment was a response to a comparison with Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:27:54
Yes. A lot. And there will soon be more and they will all keep getting better. For ios and android Bluewallet is great for Lightning Network. Instant and free tx (once wallets are loaded anyway)
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:23:57
Not doomed, but it will just change the economics of it. It’ll be as if we found large reserves of gold somewhere in the earth that were simply very difficult and expensive to mine. People will go for it and if it’s profitable, pump a lot more gold into the system. Economics takes care of the rest. Bitcoin is designed to avoid such a scenario though and you’re right it will keep improving and your implicit point that it is superior to gold I agree with
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:30:42
The point is that Bitcoin is often not considered a currency either or an easily usable form of payment. But it takes two minutes to cross that bridge for anyone who’s never used it before (admittedly a bit more time to ensure they know how to use it safely and securely)
@_date: 2019-07-30 13:14:47
For sure.
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:04:29
Will this work for me? I am not a EU nor USA resident.
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:41:31
just seems extra hassle and I worry about receiving the money to a bank account \(and then what about taxes?\). 
If a BTC ATM card is 2&amp; fees for say 1,500 bucks to live on for a month, that's about 30 dollars payment to avoid hassle and time of finding someone on LBC, worries about scams, creating paper trail with my bank, etc.
I have never used either though so maybe I'm misunderstanding some aspect of it \(please do correct me if I'm wrong about something here!\). 
Thanks for you response!
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:32:22
Thanks! I hadn't seen this one so will look into it. I don't really care what fiat it's in as I will be withdrawing into many fiats, usually not USD/GBP/EUR as I am all over the world... So the important thing is just whatever has lowest fees. For this reason I figured a card that withdraws direct from BTC into whatever the ATM currency is would be best \(one change rather than two?\) but maybe this isn't possible... 
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:06:19
I do not have anything in my home country
@_date: 2018-05-17 09:54:45
Yeah it took me too long until I realized Monaco isn't even issuing cards yet! The ones that are already out are excessively expensive as you say... This is proving to be a lot more difficult than I expected.
@_date: 2018-05-16 19:02:33
Understood, thank you so much for clarifying! Can I ask. Do you use it? How has it been? If issues with customer service, how have they been?
@_date: 2018-05-15 10:32:24
Thanks. This is one of the main ones I was looking at. As I understand it though they charge a 2&amp; fee after the first 200 USD \(equivalent\) withdrawal. This sounds like a lot, but is perhaps less than others \(do they not charge the 3&amp; foreign exchange fee that many of the others seem to charge?\). Thanks
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:33:54
That's fine. I'd dump in as much USD as I need to live on for a week or two, then just top it up as I go. I'd never withdraw back into BTC. It just depends on what fees are... From what I saw bitpay seems to be higher than others.
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:03:28
When you say "will be" you mean "presently is, unless something better comes along"?
Those higher tiered cards are bloody expensive... Seems for my purposes the introductory card should be good enough for moment \(I'll need like 1,000\-1,500 usd worth of withdrawals per month for living expenses\). Not sure there's value added in going higher tiered
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:42:32
Thanks, but yeah this isn't what I'm looking for. Shouldn't it help to get going on revolut?
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:59:50
Ah so "interbank exchange rate limit" is like if I do POS, as in pay with it as if it's a credit card like in a restaurant or wherever accepts card as form of payment. Is this correct? 
Interesting point re the 50 MCOs... If it isn't a total scam \(and it seems not to be\) then perhaps yeah you can sell that off so it perhaps should be viewed more as a deposit than anything else? I guess this is the way you are thinking about it?
I still wonder about taxes...
Thanks for your responses man. This card seems to be the winner \(even if I go for the cheapest version\)
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:18:17
If I am understanding correctly, Monaco's free card seems to have the cheapest fees, as follows:
0\-200 USD: Free withdrawals
200\-2,000 USD: 2&amp; fee
2,000\+: 2.5&amp; fee
This is all lower than the standard fees of other cards, which is 3&amp; foreign exchange rate fee, this in addition to some which also have a flat fee \(e.g. 2\-3 USD or so\).
Anyone know if I am understanding this correctly?
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:09:16
Any non\-EU citizens used e\-residency in Estonia to set up a revolut account and use that for crypto? Could this work?
@_date: 2018-05-17 09:53:52
Thanks I had a look. 2.5&amp; transaction fee plus 1.5&amp; international exchange fee, so 4&amp; total fees. Excessive... Also costs quite a lot to purchase in the first place.
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:01:30
Thanks, but at 10 USD per MCO token, those are VERY expensive cards to get... 
Even the introductory \(midnight blue\) card seems to be better than others. 2&amp; is expensive, but cheaper than your average visa card for international withdrawals, and it seems cheaper than any other card I have found \(if I am understanding things right, I presume this 2&amp; fee after the first 200 bucks corresponds with others who say there is a 3&amp; tx fee for international withdrawals, is this right?\). 
What is difference between "interbank exchange rate limit" and "atm withdrawal limit"? 
Thanks for info! It's hard understanding what all this stuff means...
@_date: 2018-05-17 09:27:45
Thanks. Sounds fantastic. Up until you said "before the cards roll out". So you cannot yet get the actual cards?
@_date: 2018-05-16 19:01:17
How do you mean it's not already "out"? People already have it and are using it? Am I missing something...?
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:05:48
Thanks a lot... That's 500 USD to buy this card though... Seems excessive. Also 400 USD free atm withdrawal already seems kinda low but I guess nothing else can compete. and I'm a bit confused as to the difference between this and interbank exchange rates limit as per my other questions above. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 10:17:01
Thanks :\-\)
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:12:55
Cheers! Will have a look tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-03-23 17:35:59
It was 50k. And he said it was based on nothing but his liking round numbers
@_date: 2018-06-06 00:11:33
Thanks! Seems Bitpay may be best for time being... or possibly coinbase card. Hope Monaco comes out soon! Their customer service told me they can’t even provide a vague idea of when it might happen though ��
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:13:15
Thanks for all this. A lot of those options I looked into but unfortunately don't work for me...


Cash app looks like the winner potentially. Do you have to wait to get physical card to use it? Or can you use it as a virtual card? Seems you can also send from cash app instantly to a fiat bank account by paying 1.5% of total transaction value, and load with Bitcoin first to do this. This has worked well for you?
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:40:15
Got it. So it is exactly like the analogy of tracking the price of USD vs Bolivars every time one receives and spends USD and reporting every transaction in a year noting these price differences. This is nuts. Thanks for all the responses did not know all this. Am completely dumbfounded by it.
@_date: 2019-08-25 22:02:26
Egifter worked. Expensive but great to see there is an option. Will keep looking for others that are more competitive. Monaco is finally out in the US? Not yet Europe?
@_date: 2019-08-26 19:55:29
I managed to get some usd on and withdraw to my bank account quickly/easily. Honestly I’m shocked at how easy it was... thanks! Will look into btc use next.
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:09:29
I kind of follow but what is the definition of “gain” exactly? I have money that I am spending. I don’t see how governments could view it in such a complicated way (when I know what gain means maybe I’ll start to grasp it)
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:21:55
Oh I see thanks, but not everyone thinks of/uses Bitcoin as if it’s an investment (which is sort of the thinking behind what you describe). Bitcoin is a currency, and some people are paid in and live almost entirely off of it. What you describe is just not feasible for such people.
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:36:14
Still trying to wrap my head around it. The example I gave is someone receiving and spending one currency (USD), not a currency trader. What about people who solely receive and spend BTC? They are not trading currencies.
@_date: 2019-08-25 22:03:42
surely if you make a small purchase here and there it's not going to massively affect taxes? admittedly I don't know exactly how crypto works with taxes, just that it is a massive headache depending on the country
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:28:24
Thanks. I see. I just find this really shocking. Would be interesting to see a comparison between what the US and other governments are requiring in this regard. I mean it’s just impossible for some people to stay compliant if that’s what the US expects them to demonstrate. It would be like having to demonstrate price difference between USD and Bolivars for every time someone ever receives or spends USD over the course of the year.
