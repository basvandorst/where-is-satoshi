Happy Cake Day PotatoBadger! The Eurex Potato (GOJ15) trading went from $13 to $3.20 in one year, while BTC went from $680 to $250. Which do you think will have a higher chance of return for 2016?

But still 'playing safe'. The relevant part:
4. Bitcoin will continue to gain ground (but not as a currency)
Bitcoin will continue to attract more people as a store of value and a speculative investment asset. I predict that the value of Bitcoin still has the potential to double by the same time next year. But I believe it will have a hard time becoming mainstream as a currency, due to its expected continued volatility amidst regulation authorities and governments figuring out what to make of the cryptocurrency.

I'm also concerned. Now there is either a big support wall at $600 to protect their investment (if they have another $20MM ready) or a huge free fall if gets below it and they decide to dump it to cut losses.

Great initiative - always good to see new authentication approach!
Now, having a "portable identity" and given the high probability of successful client attacks (higher than server), phishing attacks that try to get your private keys when you are about to use them would become even harder to identify.
Quick glance through but besides perhaps usability, what's the key difference of using BitAuth .vs. signing a message with a bitcoin key?

and with the same dollar market value as the Trust Max amount: $20MM...

Besides "where" to go, to start, set some short term goals first, to build for example:
- a simple webpage that uses any (1) bitcoin API
- a script/webpage to validate/check if a bitcoin address is correct/valid
- an address watcher
These are just some examples to help drive your learning process and are note as far ahead as "contribute to cryptocurrency projects".
It's a long journey but also an exciting road ahead!

The calculations Bitcoin miners work on ARE useful work. They are designed in a way to make it possible to have a secure distributed network. That's not pointless. :)
On the other hand, most of mining today is made using ASICs = special purpose hardware that only do one type of calculation.
So you have many PetaHashes (or some try to equate to PetaFlops even) that cannot do anything else other than Bitcoin (or double-SHA-256) calculations. So all that "processing power" in Bitcoin would equate to ZERO processing power for protein folding for example.

thought exactly the same! in this 3 of 4 model, where you control 2 keys, you can even store one safely away/part of a will - and use only in case of major dispute or when one of those keys are lost.
of course, they could still 'collude' to throw away their keys in an everybody-loses scenario.
if you already have a party of 4, then I guess you need a 4 of 5 set of keys where you hold 2 of them and need to use 1(everybody signs) or 2(only 2 other sign) to sign the transaction.

true - The good news is that there is still quite a lot of space for innovation in this area.
@_date: 2015-05-01 21:02:25
Perhaps better than trying to define if "regulation is necessary" would be for regulators to provide guidance of cryptocurrencies within the current regulation framework.
A clear guideline on the current status will boost even more innovation and adoption than trying to come up with new rules (and not releasing them) placing most initiatives in paralysis mode until there is a better understanding of which direction things will go.

This is interesting - yet I couldn't figure out the details:
a S5 will produce in average 0.35BTC/month. If electricity is truly what wikipedia says $0.04/kwh, you have $73.47 left every month.
If we consider the black market exchange rate, this would be 33k VEF/month.
Average engineer wage in Venezuela (according to glassdoor) goes from 10k to 20k VEF.
If you both are on the lower end, this means (10+10k)*2 = $40k (10k short of the twice a month figure).
If you are not on the lower end, or if you use official VEF/USD the same way electricity price is tied to official VEF/USD rates, then this number gets even worse.
And that without even factoring in the S5 costs (or how did you import one?)
again - great message, just trying to figure out the math...

Thanks - I know about the definition of Random Seed. I'm trying to find at what point in the transaction creation/signing process that "random seed" is used. Couldn't find it on the bitcoin.it wiki - guess will have to look the code :-/
@_date: 2013-05-08 02:23:36
agree - protocol not affected. But any code that creates a Transaction record can be a weak point depending on how that random number is used/created.

Here:  
This report says being able to identify over 100 addresses where you can find the private key because of the way the transaction was signed.

@_date: 2013-05-08 01:38:23
I'm trying to identify what is this "random seed" in the transaction creation process then.
I understand this seed is different from the ECDSA/private key for the address. Is this seed the 4-byte hash added to the Transaction data before the double-SHA?
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:04:16

He is right on with his comments about the public ledger aspect of Bitcoin and good to see the conversation turning towards the protocol and what it enables, and not the usual 'get rich quick' or 'it's a trap!' articles....
One strong case also for what the Bitcoin 'protocol' enables is the ability to transfer property/value between untrusted parties. There is a good number of entities and organizations that their entire existence is based on being a trusted party. From escrow services to ACH-like needs, public notaries and record-keeping institutions.
But the real outcome of a public and 'perpetual' ledger is completely unknown. Soon there will be blockchain archaeologists uncovering all sorts of stories...
