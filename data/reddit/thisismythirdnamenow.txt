I'm not sure that this is good.

RIP in peace

Thanks alot.
You have been the most helpful person in my journey so far, and I really appreciate it.

I'm trying not to link my bank account to an exchange. Do you know any that accept Paypal without trouble or making you link a bank account?
Also, I only have debit cards, not credit cards, if that affects anything.

I'm not really sure what I want to do with it.

This game is slightly profitable, since the bitcoin price is dropping.
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:49:14
That's interesting.
I spent some time looking around there, they still ask for your information though.

I like this idea.
Easy to get into, and not too scary.
Especially if you're trading, you don't have to directly fund an account or wallet.
I like this.

I don't currently have a credit card. I have debit cards, and can possibly buy a prepaid to use to buy Bitcoin or Litecoin.

I think that there is a proliferation of payment-positive options, but we'll see.

OKcoin sounds like an acceptable marketplace. I can't really justify paying fees for my level of involvement if I can get around it.
So I would have to fund the account in dollars and then buy/sell for BTC or LTC when I thought that the price was good there?
And I guess that I have to do some research and take a bigger sample of all the different marketplaces, not just Circle and Coinbase.

Are you giving them your bank account information?
If so, they've got a lot more than your selfie and a license pic.
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:14:14
So should I be buying them in order to trade markets, accepting them for goods and services, or what?
I'm not really sure how to try and fit any kind of crypto into my life.
It's good advice, especially if you take the view that LTC is going to appreciate and the minimal fanfare means that there is going to be a lower fluctuation in value on the short term.

I don't want to connect my bank account directly to an exchange.

By my calculations (guess) you would make about 8 cents by the time three confirmations had processed.

Lets pretend that if you stacked up all my cash holdings, there would be less than $500.
Would you recommend I invest in cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2015-03-09 06:18:01
It's difficult for me though.
I feel like if I can only afford to put 5 dollars into a cryptocurrency, I'm likely to just spend it and be done with it.
Putting a sizeable amount of money into cryptocurrency, to where a 50% drop or gain would actually mean something substantial to me, seems like an insurmountable challenge, sometimes.
I feel like I don't have enough to be able to risk a significant quantity comfortably.
Then again, I could probably drop $20 into it and leave it at that, cross my fingers and hope for the best?
The risk is that I lose the whole $20, the potential benefit is growth over time.
