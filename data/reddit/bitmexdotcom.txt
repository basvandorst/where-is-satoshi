Just to be clear, we socialise losses to cover traders who have been liquidated, and the trading engine cannot close their position in the open market. We have never lost customer deposits.

Yes we are aware of some wash trading going on, the rules of the game will be changing this weekend, and fines will be doled out. Don't despair there is still ample opportunity for someone to win the game who is not in first place.

Thanks for the report; a few bugs cropped up after we removed jQuery from the site and that was one of them. The fix has been rolled into the latest release and is now live.

Hi - thanks for reporting this, we've found the problem and deployed a fix. Sorry for giving you a bad first experience; we hope you come back and give the game a try.

Hi BitcoinBravo, we are actually live and have been for nearly a month. We have seen what we believe is very encouraging volume during that time. We are already offering quanto and inverse futures (no other exchange offers both) as well as calendar spreads. We also have the only no-clawback settlement policy in the industry. We will be announcing new products and enhancements in the near future as we improve the exchange.

To trade BTC/CNY in China you need to have onshore CNY to deposit on the exchange. Onshore CNY is a restricted currency so for the vast majority of people the Chinese market is off limits.

We are interested in giving it a shot. We currently have a hardware approach to our hot storage but we are always interested in evaluating new options. We generally prefer programmable options, so this would only be useful to us if accompanied with SDKs for signing arbitrary p2sh transactions.

If China wanted to ban bitcoin they would have done it already. Calm down To Da Moon!!

XBT follows the ISO 4217 currency code standard while BTC does not - it is likely that as Bitcoin grows it will be necessary to use this symbol. It is similar to how Ripple uses "XRP".

Next stop are all these "vouchers" see how long it takes the major exchanges to pull that funding option as well.

We are still debating internally how we would handle that. There are two roads:
1. Any hack constitutes a full payout
2. The % payout depends on the severity of loss
We would like to know the community's preference. We want to make the product as tradable as possible so we are very receptive to the opinions of traders.

The great thing about Bitcoin is that you can use it as margin to open positions that profit either from the price rising (going long), or the price falling (going short). Even if you bet on the Bitcoin / USD price, you never need to touch any USD.

Lets say you are trading futures contracts. When things were going crazy in November of 2013 there were March 2014 futures contracts trading at $2,000 while spot was at $1,000. The market had to double in four months for the buyers to just break even. Meanwhile if you sold the contract and bought spot you made a 100% profit guaranteed (unless the exchange goes under) for effectively lending the longs USD to buy Bitcoin. That is how the market corrects, the person willing to take the other side (selling Bitcoin buying USD) will demand a higher and higher locked in return (in USD) to lend you money with which to speculate.

BVOLJ15 hasn't taken off in the way we would have hoped. It was our first iteration on a Bitcoin volatility futures contract. Using feedback from users, we have redesigned the product into something we believe will be more popular with traders. Instead of being a monthly contract, it will shift to a daily expiring contract (BVOL24H). If you think that there will be a spike of volatility intra-day, you can buy this contract and profit on that prediction rather quickly. If you think the market will calm down significantly intra-day, you can sell the contract and profit. Given the current stop and start trading pattern currently in the market, we believe this contract will add another way for traders to profit without having to guess the direction of the move correctly. This should allow a more trader friendly contract. If you have any feedback we welcome it.

If speculators expect the future price of Bitcoin to be higher they will borrow money for the leverage. The sellers will demand a high interest rate to lend the buyers capital with which to speculate. Sellers will receive a guaranteed return by either lending USD on a margin trading platform at a high rate (in 2013 rates were as high as 1% per day), or sell futures contracts at a massive premium to spot (in 2013 you could double your money in 3 months by selling futures and buying spot Bitcoin). As rates go higher and higher, it takes a greater and greater move upwards for buyers to make a profit after financing charges. This is how the market functions if there is intense buying pressure from speculators trading on margin or with leverage through futures products.

There are still not enough traders playing the future vs. spot arbitrage. Once that becomes more pronounced, then the linkage between the two markets will be more relevant. Right now they related but still separate spheres. If you want to move the price, you trade spot.

We offer a historical volatility futures contract called BVOL that lets you bet on the level of 30 day historical volatility using Bitfinex spot prices. We will be rolling out a daily version of this contract as well. You can find it on [BitMEX](

This is Arthur the CEO of [BitMEX]( here. We have a futures contract that expires every 24 hours at 12:00 GMT, with a ticker symbol of XBU24H. Each contract is worth 1 USD of Bitcoin, and expires on the Bitfinex Bitcoin/USD exchange rate. It is perfect for hedging short term price movements. Because of the short duration, the futures price tracks spot very closely. The contract also has ultra low fees so that it is useful for payment processors and businesses that accept Bitcoin. To add liquidity to the market is free, and to take liquidity costs 0.03%. There are no socialised losses either; BitMEX guarantees settlement. If you want to find out more, here is a link to the [contract specifications](

We are the only centrally cleared Bitcoin derivatives exchange, which in a nutshell means we stand behind our contracts. As a result, we offer lower leverage and have a greater focus on risk management and margin policy. Our margin policy is fully transparent, and during a margin call our goal is to liquidate as little as possible so that traders retain some equity and can continue trading. There are no socialised losses; therefore you can use BitMEX contracts to execute hedges and arbitrage strategies. Visit [BitMEX]( to set up an account and learn more about our platform.
