Regardless of what Kim has done in his past, the US government's sins are orders of magnitude greater and more heinous. You may not like the guy, but what the US and MPAA have done is out of control.

Just use a multi-sig wallet.

Micon just set the example for everyone else in the Online Poker industry.

The more people understand it, the better, no?

Bitcoin is perfect for gambling. Vegas better start accepting it, before they get beaten by offshore casinos.
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:32:59
Yes they are. They allude multiple times to themselves as a governing body over cryptocurrencies. LOL 
I wouldn't be surprised if sometime in the future we find out those hacks on exchanges were not the work of some government agency.

I suppose it might be to early in the USA. But I think people are so tired of the war on drugs and the banksters it might actually happen. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:03:31
You are speculating that all the other members had equally high losses. Unless they come forward to declare how much they lost, 8 million is the current official figure and that is a fact for now. If more people come forward later the figures will change.

Yep, crazy stuff. Paypal, visa and mastercard blocked Julian Assange from getting donations for wikileaks too.
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:38:19
I wonder how much the movie rights are?
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:29:33
I would really like to see that happen, but I doubt it. Business is war.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:08:19
That is actually a pretty good idea. Crowdfunding for education.
@_date: 2015-02-18 23:34:05
ohh don't you worry, they will find something.
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:59:50
Misunderstanding? How so? You have a group of people who have appointed themselves "keepers" of Bitcoin. That goes against everything Bitcoin is supposed to represent. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 03:59:24
Gridcoin is one of those undiscovered jewels of the cryptocurrency scene. Gridcoin would benefit a lot with the help of Koinify.
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:52:20
And futures are leveraged. What's your point?
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:17:57
Ye, and if you start winning too much they will throw you out. That is the "house" edge.
@_date: 2015-02-14 01:27:32
Finally, someone with some sense. That is what I was trying to get at, these guys @ the foundation may have good intentions for Bitcoin, but their good intentions can do a lot of damage. If the integrity of Bitcoin is tied to any one individual or a group, guess what, it is not decentralized anymore.

I only visited Las Vegas once, and I am never going back again. F U Las Vegas crooks!

Brave new world I tell ya.

@_date: 2015-02-13 20:23:59
Would you be kind enough to point something out specifically?
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:59:32
A centrally managed block-chain based crypto might be a still be a big improvement over going back to some shitty fiat drachma. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:58:07
Except cash and lighters don't take 15-20 minutes to be anonymously transferred half-way around the world.
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:23:16
Cash and Bitcoin are different, let's face it. Of course the US dollar is the favorite currency of just about any bad guy, but the US dollar is under government control, bitcoin is not. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:34:36
As long as the hedge is on, the bitcoin is in their possession.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:10:38
They also want to be exempt. LOL
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:00:17
lol, read the article, it is just a proposal for potential use.
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:02:57
Another pump-and-dump and bitcoin will never have a future as an actual currency. Tech bubble, housing bubble, soon to be Bitcoin bubble, courtesy of the boys on wall street. Anyone why doesn't see it coming is blind.
@_date: 2015-02-14 00:42:13
And what happens when the developers come under attack or are threatened by any state authority or anyone else for that matter?? Do you understand that by having a central entity you are opening yourself to all kinds of attack methods? 
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:46:17
I agree. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 00:06:53
I wonder what the exchange rate will be once it get's on Poloniex and Cryptsy?
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:03:54
Don't you get it? The pump-n-dump will kill bitcoin as an actual medium of exchange. It will become like gold, something the bankers can toy with.
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:37:19
lol, can you imagine that? With all the shit that has happened to bitcoin exchanges, I would not be surprised at all.
@_date: 2015-02-14 21:41:01
Haha Yep!
@_date: 2015-02-16 15:37:59
I agree on this fact, some of the biometric requirements on these ATMs are very Orwellian.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:58:57
Unless someone hacks Apple Pay.
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:11:55
It will be a tough sell, people are too used to free email.
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:28:39
Even if these guys don't finish I am sure someone else will pick up where they left off.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:59:25
Ohh don't worry about that, it's only a matter of time before the ATM operator regulations come to town. I give it a few more months.
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:50:02
Bitcoin was hoovering around the 200-230 mark and only after the Coinbase announcement all the speculators ran the price to $300 in about a day.
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:05:53
The higher the leverage the higher the volatility. Not to mention the "blowup" risk the exchange is taking on. Just look how many Forex brokers went bankrupt over the CHF fiasco.
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:57:40
That is definitely a good first step.
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:29:13
why would it disappear? it is already 1 year old and still has kept it's value pretty stable while Litecoin and Bitcoin have dropped like rocks.
@_date: 2015-02-18 23:35:34
the keyword being "theoretically", Apple doesn't like to incorporate things they don't control.
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:09:53
I think I phrased the title really badly. A more appropriate one would be "Will Bitcoin tumbling be outlawed?" As the article focuses more on that and how effective current tumbling really is.
