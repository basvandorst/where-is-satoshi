So, do you think that tariffs on trade are only meant for profiteering by governments? You know that they serve other purposes, right? That doesn't mean that all trade should be taxed by any means, but tariffs do serve purposes other than filling a governments coffers.

Running your own country, wouldn't you want to know what was happening with billions of dollars of wealth? Sure it's a drop in the bucket right now... but I think the potential is there for it to really rock the financial world in more ways than we have seen up to this point.
My point is... if governments are starting to get involved, you know this shit is going to be valuable. Of course they want to know what's going on and how to keep it's potential consequences to a minimum. It only makes sense.

Lots of sells because of the lunar year (apparently happens every year), news out of China, HODL cult recruitment at an all-time low... Take your pick.

Yeah, because it's never dipped this hard before. Idiot.
