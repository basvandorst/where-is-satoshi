I still keep most of my coins on coinbase because I haven't been able to figure out how to store them 100% securely on my computer.  I also kind of worry about loosing the keys or something and not being able to get them later.  I'm really just waiting for an easy-to-use *secure* wallet I can keep on my computer and back up on a hard-drive or something.

Ya, I understand those issues.  I've thought of how a bitcoin credit union could work and the issues you brought up seem insurmountable.  But if the goal is to avoid centralized fiat institutions, then there needs to be available credit to expand services on scale.  Perhaps BTC could be more of a backing used by credit unions?  I think that's kind of what ripple does.

Doesn't this have to happen?  How can the BTC economy grow without credit?

If you haven't yet, you should read his book *The Ascent of Money*  I read it a while back and learned a lot.  I should probably give that one a reread because of how concisely he describes the history and evolution of monetary systems.

I mean, I disagree with some of his opinions but I think that book had a lot of important insights, though I haven't read it since 2008.  I liked your essays btw.

It's a massive difference.  $1 Million is enough to live off if you live very modestly ($50,000 per year). $10 million is enough to live off extremely comfortably ($500,000 per year)

Why?  Ltc has a hard limit of 84m.  Shouldnt it be better for holding or buying/replenishing?  Ive been buying both but I think ltc has more growth potential.  Etherum will certainly be better for use though and may have more stable prices.

I don't, you're making a straw-man argument.  Rapists and child pornographers make up a very small portion of those persecuted by the criminal justice system.  Most people caught up in the system have no reason being there, other than being poor.

This seems rather ignorant.  I suppose it's somewhat true for dopamagenic drugs but not for empathogens (serotogenic ones).  It seems somewhat odd that as a brain scientist, you've never had the curiosity to experiment with your own.  The fact is, there is a lot of subjectivity with regards to consciousness and closed mindedness will make a whole range of experiences inaccessible.  
No you don't need drugs, but judging others from a stance of ignorance is a sign of weakness.  I think people who have never tried drugs are weak because they do not have the courage to explore the boundaries of their own self.

No, the criminal (in)justice system is terrible in general
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:28:13
Partially, but mostly because it unfairly targets the poor and minorities for "crimes" that don't harm anyone else while white middle/upper class people are left alone.  Not to mention its shear waste and inefficiencies.  
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:06:18
I said partially, if reference to the fact that drugs are illegal and there should be avenues of trade for drugs.  I never once condoned child pornography.  I also said partially in reference to the unjust manner in which laws are enforced.

What's wrong with money laundering? You're onthe government could charge you with money laundering if they wanted to.

I  would typically by back a little more as products are often cheaper with BTC than their value in $ amounts.  It's not much but I definitely added at least 0.5 BTC to my stash doing this (since 2013).  I don't spend them as much as I used to though.
@_date: 2013-10-03 15:00:29
So they only seized the coins stored on SR and don't have access to DPRs personal Bitcoin stash?  I'm sure they could subpoena him for them, but if he did use a dead-man's switch, it would make it more difficult.  Would demanding the private keys be an infringement on his 5th amendment rights? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:20:21
right?  [Original post](  is a really good discussion.  This is a possibility I had not considered before.

- Is this wrong?  I'm unsure.

thanks, you saved me having to try to find a good one on google.  part of what I love about reddit
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:57:05
ok, that makes sense then.  What do you think they will do with the bitcoins they seized from silk road?
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:31:54
If they did that all at once, it would drive down prices initially.  When's the government bitcoin sale haha?
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:23:47
I don't really know though, some of the stuff in the post seems stretched, especially towards the end.  Also, the top level comment offers some good critiques.  But the scenario is certainly possible, though unlikely IMO, and something I had not previously considered.  Also, I checked out some of his sources that he linked and they don't really do much to support his argument
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:51:45
Man, everything I said except the first comment was a joke. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:42:11
hahaha.  Email?  Is that like gmail?
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:41:25
I'd imagine they hold onto them for future investigations on the numerous new platforms that will come out to replace SR.  
But 600K is 5% of the total in circulation so that is not insignificant.  
There are two huge unknowns though.  One is whether or not the FBI actually possesses DPR's bitcoin stash.  The other is, how many bitcoins did they seize from silk road accounts.  I haven't seen answers to either of these in any reports
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:01:48
What is this the 90's?
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:18:23
Serious question:
How can the FBI seize bitcoins?  Isn't it inherently impossible within the bitcoin framework to seize them without the consent of the owner of the wallet?
Furthermore, what happens to all of the bitcoins that people had on their SR accounts?  Can those technically be "seized"?
If they can be seized like that, what are the implications?  How will federal possession of those coins affect the market?
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:55:11
The only drug that would possibly be legalized anytime soon is marijuana and I don't think that was a large part of SR anyway because its cheap, plentiful, easy to get, big, and smelly.  
They will NEVER legalize other drugs for as long as they are able to.  There is too much money in it and there is a war on your mind.
I don't see bit coins going anywhere but the price will go down in the immediate wake.  
How much do you think the price will go down though?  whats a good buy point?  If it goes to $50 im gonna buy a bunch

Cause It's Fun!  How else would you send dick-pics to all your friends at once?
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:47:40
This is my feeling too.  I don't see what they'd gain by selling them, but they'd certainly be useful in future investigations.

Are the security risks really big in coinbase?  What's the best way to secure my wallet?  I worry about the security of my PC and trust coinbase more than I trust myself to handle security.  Is this unwise?
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:37:40
Yes.  If you or someone you know has snapchat, then the software will go through all of your internet connected devices and deletes pictures and videos it determined to have originated in the snapchat network.  
Why else did you think it is worth $3 billion?
