While I'm no fan of the banks, this has more to do with government and the cost of compliance from all of the regulations.  If government wasn't back-stopping the banks you'd see a completely different banking system.

That's the spirit only for those that are losing their ass.  I'm sure there are loads of people that bought in at $18-19k and are going to hold on in hopes of recoup, but I doubt very many are doubling down and adding to their position.
How many people that bought in at $5-10k or $1-5k are going to continue to hold if the price drops further?  I foresee a lot of profit taking as Bitcoin has no other value than a speculative one.

The amount of early adopters that continue to hold will be the real test.
If those that bought in from the beginning feel it's time to take the gains you could see the bottom fall out.  There is no other driver to this market than people willing to speculate on bitcoin's value.

@_date: 2017-11-13 13:43:37
One could argue that this entire sub is mainly concerned with the exchange rate of BTC to the USD.  
I would argue that futures indeed will not affect blockchain technology as a whole, but it will absolutely affect BTC as it will be subject to the possibility of manipulation and thus obfuscate its true value.  One of the key tenets of BTC is its steady mining rate - with futures that goes right out the window.
EDIT:  Further, what value does BTC actually have if you're buying and selling BTC that don't exist?  Where's the utility in that?  Where's the intrinsic value in that?  We're talking speculation in its truest form now.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:23:50
I'm talking about earning the $1M spent on establishing the ATM.  It doesn't matter where the initial $1M came from or how it was earned, it's gotta be recouped as it's now sunk in that machine.
If averaging a 5% premium on transactions you'd need $20M to run through that sucker just to break even.  I'd be surprised if that machine is used 5x a month.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:18:45
And therein lies the rub.  Once BTC is on the CME the floodgates will open and BTC will be subjected to regulation after regulation.  Who knows, it may become cost prohibitive for exchanges of BTC as well once they comply with proper regulation.
Why do you think foreign banks want nothing to do with US customers?  They can't afford to comply with the regulations.
Though we're starting to stray a bit off topic. :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:10:38
I don't disagree with you, my stance is that gold exists in physical reality whereas BTC is solely digital - but that's a different rabbit hole altogether.  The blockchain as a incorruptible ledger is invaluable.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:30:46
We shall see.  I hope you're right though I fear you're not.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:12:10
Sure, but each unit will have its associated operating costs (maintenance, rental space, customer service, etc), of which, I doubt each machine would even earn its keep.
I mean, you can just use your phone to sell your BTC if you need to liquidate in order to make a purchase in USD.  I don't understand what need these ATMs fill other than novelty, but best of luck to them.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:20:10
Agreed, which is why they complement each other so well.  Gold satisfies the real-world aspect and the blockchain brings it into the 21st century in the form of a ledger that cannot be manipulated.
Without trying to start the same old flame war, I am still of the camp that BTC has no intrinsic value.  A man cannot create gold; a man can, and will, create the successor to BTC.  When BTC is backed by the existence of gold its value is undeniable.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:38:01
Are you only okay with that because your portfolio looks good in USD terms?  Hell, some time ago people were arguing that it wasn't speculation at all that was driving the price increase, now it's good speculation because you're the very speculators?
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:45:45
It depends on the contracts/market, but yes, people can sell contracts without owning the actual commodity.  Google "naked shorting" for some head-scratching if you feel so inclined.  All of these constructs are tools for speculators to get their hands in (and in some cases manipulate) markets that they wouldn't be in otherwise and screws up the efficiency of said markets.
The government gets involved by enacting regulations, which one would assume are a good thing, but these regulations are (mostly) in place to prop up constructs that wouldn't exist in a free market, in its truest form.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:58:06
The opaqueness exists because far more trading is done in paper than it is in reality when it comes to precious metals.  It is general knowledge that there is vastly more paper gold than real gold and the only glue keeping that mess together is that no one is asking for physical delivery.  Should a nation decide to back their fiat in even the slightest percentage of PMs you'll have an absolute disaster on your hands.
With BTC in its current state, yes, it's all generally transparent.  Once these futures hit people are essentially betting on the price action with leverage, not actual BTC.  Enormous banks will move the markets and they'll make money on both sides.
The banks aren't going to kill BTC, they're just going to co-opt with their algos.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:42:51
Right, but that would really only make sense if you were a BTC miner, as anyone else isn't actually producing anything.  You're basically promising to acquire and produce rather than say, grow a field of corn.  BTC already has a set rate of production and is not subject to the same worries as other commodities (weather, labor, supply/demand) so to me, futures makes no sense.
And agreed, people will always bet, but once it's done in a centralized market controlled by the banks...does that really give you the warm and fuzzies?
EDIT: Clarification.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:06:12
Right, the kind of people that would never use a BTC ATM.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:48:10
Agreed, but it all depends on the entities creating the futures contract.  If you actually wanted the cotton you wouldn't be entering a futures contract with an entity that owns no cotton.
The fact that people can enter into contracts that have no cotton AND desire no cotton at maturity yet operate around the same price basis is troublesome.  Again, look no further than the PM markets to see what happens.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:52:05
But at least right now it's still peer-to-peer speculative investment in that the people buying in are actually holding the BTC.  There's no need to be part of a BTC ETF like there is with precious metals as BTC is incredibly easy to store and use without needing banks - that's the whole goddamn point.
A BTC ETF will completely neuter BTC as anyone that invests is just looking for exposure, not involvement.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:40:03
If the business model is meant to get people who know nothing about BTC to put their money in there, good luck.  If it's too expensive to use for those that know what they're doing, what's the point?
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:53:54
Yep - not sure why more people don't realize this.  Once you can trade futures you can short BTC without actually owning BTC - like what happens in the precious metals markets.  It's only expanding BTC into more speculative markets, not widespread adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:53:10
I understand the sentiment, but the whole point I'm making is that futures trading is contradictory to what BTC stands for.  People will be trading BTC that don't yet exist on the blockchain...
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:04:19
What's your timescale for earning that $1M back?  That's ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:43:46
It doesn't matter if they switch or not, the CME price will be the official spot price as far as the markets are concerned.  Once the CME is enacted Wall Street now has access to BTC trades and they can run their usual manipulation schemes.  The current BTC exchanges are hardly regulated and will be ripe for manipulation.  Wall Street will run the price up and down playing both sides of the trades until something breaks because they're greedy.
How the government comes down on BTC as a result? We'll just have to wait and see.  They could clamp down on the exchanges or BTC as a whole if it's big enough of a crisis.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:25:08
Not really.  The "physical" market of BTC will be dwarfed by the paper contracts - the banks aren't going to want to take delivery.  They're just going to trade the price action and make their USD, they couldn't give two shits about BTC.
Their speculation on BTC is what's going to drive the price because there's no real-world application for BTC to counteract it.  No factory needs BTC in order to produce X.  No country uses BTC as its currency.  There's literally no other industry that would be affected if BTC were to suddenly disappear, other than the BTC industry itself.  There will be supply on the exchanges but its price will be determined by the speculation, including futures, and nothing else.
I'm not saying that the BTC technology isn't valuable, just that its utility hasn't been realized and it may never be.  What's happening now is rampant speculation and it's only going to get worse.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:39:04
Alcohol has a use.  If bitcoin gets banned are people going to hangout in a speakeasy and hand coins back and forth?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:01:57
The primary concern is that the CME itself is going to be the arbiter of the USD price of BTC, the regulations will come later in response to whatever real or manufactured crises occur and whatever Wall Street wants so that their lives are easier.
The peer-to-peer exchange volume is about to be dwarfed by the CME and Wall Street institutions so the price will go whichever way they want it.  You can hodl all you want, but those paper contracts are coming.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:28:49
No, you're not wrong to be concerned.
Once Bitcoin is on the CME the CME itself will determine the daily spot price of Bitcoin by compiling prices from a handful of exchanges.  The problem is that these exchanges are hardly regulated and are therefore susceptible to shenanigans (spoofing, bots, etc) and Wall Street obviously has experience.
Once some craziness happens Wall Street will scream for more regulations on the Bitcoin exchanges and will essentially take them over via said regulation.
Why anyone on this sub thinks that Bitcoin should be handed over to Wall Street is beyond me.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:33:29
I don't really want to go down this rabbit hole, but your comparison isn't really fair.  That disappearing and reappearing act can't be considered intrinsic of BTC as it requires the existence of an electricity grid and an internet, along with a user base to keep the blockchain going.
Gold always was gold and always will be.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:32:51
A futures market is traditionally used by producers who need commodities but don't necessarily want to hold the commodity at a particular time.  For instance, if you produce clothing and know you'll need x-amount of cotton you can buy it from a producer now who will produce it for you in the future at an agreed upon price.  This obviously has impacts on both producers and consumers but it opens up another avenue of buying and selling that wouldn't exist otherwise.
The issue, however, is with the speculators.  You have people buying futures contracts that have no need for a particular commodity, they just think the price will go up or down and they'll profit on it at the other end.  These speculators never have to take possession of the commodity, or even own it to sell it, they're just selling the contracts.  There can be more contracts out on a commodity than it exists in reality because these contracts are settled in cash, not the commodity itself.
The indoctrination of BTC into the traditional financial world is not a good thing.  And dare I say it, the complete opposite of what BTC was created for...
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:08:28
I have no idea what will happen and everything I've written is a VERY basic explanation of futures contracts.  There's a very real chance that BTC will shoot up in price once futures contracts are enacted, but do you think that's because the general public love and use BTC or because the bankers have gotten their hands on it?
As I wrote in a previous comment, do you really want BTC being bought and sold before they even exist on the blockchain?  I very much love the blockchain technology and believe it's here to say, but I have no idea what's going to happen to BTC itself.  People seemingly forget that these are two separate things entirely.
EDIT: DO NOT make any of your financial decisions based on anything I've written.  If you're questioning your positions it's likely indicative that you shouldn't be speculating, at least not with money you can't afford to lose.

No one is hedging anything in BTC, why would you?  BTC exists solely in its own echo chamber - no industry requires/utilizes it, it's not any country's currency, and any retailer that accepts it immediately converts it to USD.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:13:10
It's not a currency.  It's currently a digital asset with a platform that allows a retailer to immediately convert it into an actual currency upon purchase.  The volatility is far too great for it to function as a legitimate currency.

Don't take my word for it:
Current BTC exchanges are hardly regulated so you're looking at insane opportunity for Wall Street manipulation.  What they do best. :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:11:02
It would depend on the contract, but these days they're normally settled in cash as a traditional investor has no use for bushels of corn or barrels of oil.  The way it's supposed to work was like my example above; let's say the cotton market is down and you know you're going to need cotton in the future.  You can buy it now at the depressed price and take delivery in the future when you'll need it, giving you a cheaper price without having to store it and giving money to the producer before they've even produced it.
As for your example, it's not that simple.  You have no idea what the future price of BTC (nor does anyone for any commodity, for that matter).  These future contracts are promises to produce, so we would have a contract where you give me $4000 now for a BTC I promise to produce in the future at an agreed upon date.  With current futures trading rules, if I'm unable to fulfill that obligation in the future (produce the BTC), I can just settle the contract with you in the dollar amount of the contract rather than give you a BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:23:36
I'd have to disagree about BTC having a superior price discovery to PMs as PMs have an actual real-world use (jewelry, electronics, medicine, aerospace, etc) which has a direct impact on supply/demand.  As far as I can tell, BTC is largely speculative at this point, hence the insane volatility, and thus inferior price discovery.
You are right about inflating the market with artificial supply from paper contracts and it's the same thing that happens in the PM markets.  Gold trades at something like 100-to-1 in paper contracts versus what actually exists in the real world - this can only be done because these contracts can be settled in cash and physical gold isn't wanted.
Ideally, BTC and PMs would join forces instead of arguing about which is better.  You can't beat the uncounterfeitable (not a word?) properties of both and they complement each other beautifully.  A physical, undeniable representation of value and a distributed digital ledger to verify it.  What's not to love?
EDIT: Furthered my points.

@_date: 2017-11-15 00:46:54
Yup.  Just wait and see what happens to the unregulated exchanges of BTC once Wall Street has a trading vehicle like ETFs and futures to play with.  The people that they get to invest won't own any BTC at all, only derivatives of BTC that Wall Street controls.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:18:19
Because once futures are in play the CME is going to determine the daily spot price of BTC like the COMEX does for PMs.  The spot price will be determined by sampling a number of exchanges, all of which are hardly regulated and will be subject to massive manipulation once Wall Street has a paper vehicle to trade BTC (futures).  They'll manipulate the exchanges to benefit their trades and all ordinary BTC holders will be caught in the middle.
This is no different than what Wall Street currently does to the PM markets except that the BTC community seems to be welcoming Wall Street in with open arms.  My assumption is because the majority of the current BTC community are speculators that are loving the USD price of BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:28:27
Right, but there are a multitude of drivers in the metals markets.  Where does futures trading fit in to the BTC market when the only driver right now is pure speculation?
