this is so true, that is why i never helped any of my frens or families whenever they ask me for help on how to purchase bitcoins or what coins to buy even if they ask me. i can explain to then what is bitcoin etc but never help them or give them any advice, if they really want to invest, do it themselves and they bear the full risk on what happens. Many of them might say they wont mind if you make them lose money or gave wrong advice, but seriously, if u make someone lose lets say $50k, that close fren or family member will treat it as if nothing had happened? no way man, they are gonna remember it for life and whenever they see you they are going to blame you for it

it wont happen, he didnt realize that there are like hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of bitcoin miners around, are they just gonna disappear like this? it might be overvalued now but there must still be a value in bitcoin. its a fully functional blockchain currency with millions of miners across the world. its not some idea without execution or implementation like other alts, if he is saying crypto like xvg or iota can be worth 0 then yes it can happen but not bitcoin.

yeah, bcos they are afraid that ppl will withdraw money from the banks to buy bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:24:55
yup, and in the end those miners are the one losing, a lower market cap means lower price for the coins, and miners spent a fortune to purchase and run their miners, they will take more time to recoup their investments if the price of the coin is low and market cap is low
so i dont really understand why would they spam the transactions to attack btc, they will be the ultimate losers in the end, bitcoin is already worth almost $20k before the attack and they want to attack btc n make everyone move to btrash n start all over again from scratch? when btc is really worth $0 i would want them to cry with all the btcs they earned from mining, a bunch of idiots that doesnt know how to look far

its because they realised even if the transaction fees are high, people will lose trust in btc and will not hold or invest in them anymore, and when the demand is low, btc price will drop and in the end they lose more money because of the lower price of btc, today the 100$ in btc fees they earn from 1 transaction will be worth 1$ or less tomorrow if ppl keep dumping btcs and drive down the lrice of btc

agreed, if the price of bitcoin stays at lets say 15k for months, people will lose interest and think that bitcoin will not increase in value anymore and there is no point invest more money into it. the reason why so many ppl suddenly join in is because the value of Bitcoin went from 4k to more than 10k in weeks, now the momentum stopped, it will be hard to convince ppl to buy at 15k. 
few weeks back if u tell ppl the value of bitcoin will reach 100k soon and ppl will still agree and believe, but now ppl will disagree and say even 20k seems impossible

i just dont understand what that bastard roger wants,he already hold so many bitcoins and earned alot of money, and that is still not enough??
look at what he had done now, bitcoin crashed, investors losing confidence, and his shitcoin is going down too
