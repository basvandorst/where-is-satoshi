So that means when I spend the output of a transaction in those 5 addresses, those are 'deleted' and new ones are generated?
If I recovery my wallet from a seed, how would it know what those addresses are? Aren't those random?
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:41:23
This ATM isn't actually open for public! Its only for members apparently. Be warned.

@_date: 2014-04-03 23:25:19
How can one verify transactions that are offchain?
For example, if I send 0.1 BTC offchain, and the recipient takes the input and sends it using the chain instead, wouldn 't the network reject the tx?
@_date: 2014-11-06 12:01:02
No problem! I'll pass this on.
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:23:22
Oh, thats really cool. But at the same time really insecure, no? A hacker only needs to find my seed, not some impossible-to-crack private key.

Sign up, they give you a bookmarklet. You go to a website they support, use the bookmarklet. They will send you an invoice to pay BTC in, and then they pay it for you in USD, and ship it to your location. If the website somehow screws up a human is here to help you also.
**tl;dr bitpay for usd**
Edit: here's an experience I've had for buying on snapCard. I tried to buy something on deviantArt (points), but the system couldn't figure out how to buy the points and give them to me, so I chatted with the support guys and they opened a new DA account and sent the points to me. Pretty neat I have to say. And only 2% fee.

If the wallet was encrypted with a strong password, then it would be difficult to crack the password and therefore acquire the keys, unless the wallet was open at that time, which shouldn't happen unless you are sending money. 
Good security would mean not to have any confidential information open while opening attachments, no matter suspicious or not.
