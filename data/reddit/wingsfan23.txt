Don't be mad at coinbase, be mad at the government's regulations it is forced to follow.
@_date: 2015-12-02 20:12:41
Andddd the total number of bitcoins in circulation decreases... Time to buy.
@_date: 2016-03-30 17:57:54
Make the program. 3600'ish key-gens shouldn't take very long.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:30:12
It was 25K BTC :) ... roughly $500,000 then, or $100 million today... damn
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:41:59
... Back in 2017 they used to trade millions of their bits for worthless pieces of paper they called "dollars"

Are you actually expecting a quality answer here? Nobody knows what's going to happen bud. Sorry.

Try logging into the common sites with your username+pw is your best shot.
Coinbase, Blockchain.info webwallet, Circle.com
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:43:05
Do you have pending deposits or unexecuted orders?

Ya, it could be useful as long as there is a fee market on the blockchain, which will likely be forever.
If you clear the transactions that are sending less than a few satoshis, it shouldn't take up much space at all on a hard drive for years to come.
You would end up with a potentially interesting collection of signed transactions that could be re-propogated by anyone if the input coins are still unspent...

Its tough... People are working long hours for months/years to make a useful tool for the community, and every little fault is met with harsh criticism and attacks. 
People in this community just feel entitled to receiving flawless, 100% privacy, open-sourced, free software as soon as it is alpha released. &lt;/petty rant&gt;
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:27:33
Quit making 1000 posts talking about them just because someone puts out a couple tweets and some bullshit commits on a git.
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:58:25
Yes, if basically all of the miners (95%) stopped mining, Bitcoin wouldn't work well for a while... but that won't happen.
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:31:17
Mining is now a hundred million dollar industry. Its past the point of throwing together some components, it is at the $30mil clean room fab with teams of dedicated engineers level lol.
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:56:33
Able to swing the price of bitcoin a few hundred dollars by just updating a faq section lol... I love this market.
@_date: 2017-10-06 09:56:01
The current process is to click "fork" on the Bitcoin Core github, and then make a few tweets so that r/bitcoin gives you free publicity by making 1000 posts about destroying your fork to save bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:43:43
Well that's why the HDD is at 100%, because you are currently writing 160GB of data to it... It will slow down after initial sync.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:58:59
Dude... I respect you and believe your mining farm is making money, but you are overly paranoid about some down-voting conspiracy. The reason you are down-voted is because you're constantly being overly suspicious, without just ever talking like a normal person about your mine. It gets annoying to constantly read posts about you being an imaginary victim.
Just share pics, talk about it, help some people out, and lets move on.
@_date: 2017-07-04 03:59:25
You must be a troll. Nobody can be this delusional. A simple solar panel hooked to a bitcoin miner does not warrant the 17 teaser threads you've started this year. We simply don't care anymore, but you continue to think there is a conspiracy against you...
@_date: 2017-07-01 00:38:07
You've posted like 12 posts about him in the last 20 minutes... why...
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:53:35
He's bitcoinsignguy, not me.
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:11:39
We've already seen a 25-33% drop from when the possibility of a fork surfaced... This event is not a surprise to the market. 
If everyone and their grandma knows "its gonna drop!", they probably already sold off weeks ago. IDK, we'll see what happens.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:22:08
Don't let the drama get to you bud. There are a million regular level-headed people in Bitcoin, with ~20-50 drama queens with loud speakers on social media. And luckily, these people don't have any real power other than blasting off angry posts on the internet. Bitcoin will be just fine.
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:01:51
I agree, Bitcoin desperately needs a standard format for transaction history. There are many great services in the crypto space, but it is difficult to move transaction history between them to make full use of a public ledger system.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:57:00
IDK while y'all care so much about this fork coin everyday. Just let them fork away and let's finally move on with our lives eh?
@_date: 2017-07-03 00:19:17
lol @ the downvotes from people who sold off and are hoping for a drop.
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:57:34
Good call, I didn't believe it would happen so soon
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:32:37
Instead of giving him clicks, you advertised his name twice in the title of a post that is completely unrelated to him... 
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:36:53
Enough with the FUD, one small exchange in switzerland doesn't mean all exchanges are closing the doors. There probably wont even be a fork
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:54:46
Uh, I hope you aren't really waiting for a price drop. Activating the greatest technological advancements to money the world has ever seen (Lightning, Mimblewimble, Rootstock...) is going to be a substantial price increase. The scary fork will probably not even happen.
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:37:02
A dev who hasn't committed to core in 2 years was on an extremely tight time schedule to code the biggest change to bitcoin while the entire world watches him makes an error *before* the first alpha (not even beta) code release... Big deal.
Sure, he should know better, the timing should be relaxed, this and that... But don't call him out as an idiot so quickly.
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:20:56
1. Good job editing HTML
2. If you are holding that much on a blockchain.info wallet you are doing it wrong.
