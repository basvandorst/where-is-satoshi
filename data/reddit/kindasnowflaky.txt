That's funny

Do you honestly think we're going to feel the effects of this debt in our lifetime? I'm a millennial and just don't see it happening. Just like I don't see us feeling the true effects of global warming.
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:56:42
It's not happening any time soon. We are AMERICA!  in the WORLD!!!
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:04:59
Okay, but it won't be felt.
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:37:14
They pul it from thin air like everybody else.
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:06:16
I'm dead ass!
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:43:56
Buy. Hold. Lambo.

Wow. Coinbase doesn't work in New Zealand?
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:31:36
Got it!
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:48:04
I'm not arguing. Have a wonderful day.

Thanks! I'm just new ish to everything and I've been reading up on a lot of discussion boards and the behaviour is very toxic and counterproductive. I haven't quite lost yet; however, I did stupidly buy BTC at $6598 last week.
But the culture, imo, is comparable to the gaming world, which is very, very toxic at sometimes. People need to get outside and exercise more. The crypto world can be time consuming and exhilarating.

You're very right, monopoly is never good and it does indeed stunt innovation. I forgot to consider that. I'm curious as to what value you think coins like Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. offer?
@_date: 2018-08-18 18:54:05
Wise words.
@_date: 2018-08-18 18:10:12
LEARNED THE HARD WAY!!!! ����������
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:54:33
Lol. You're really right. Guess I need to open my eyes.
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:14:42
In my humble and honest opinion, I just feel like all the alt coins are a huge distraction to a more widespread adoption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general as an idea. It's like introducing Venezuelan money into a perfect economy of USD  and GBP. Not necessary.

Oh c'mon bro. Financial math is intuitive to me. When my energy is off I experience a sort of lapse of memory...
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:42:57
Lol. I totally get it. These formulas are usually intuitive for me, but for whatever reason they sometimes escape me.
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:13:09
Gawd. Thank you.

I need Silk Road! ��
@_date: 2018-08-16 05:16:52
Hmm. Are smart contracts exclusive to Ethereum or can anybody develop something similar?
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:06:56
Your willful ignorance is exhausting. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:57:07
I don't get what you're saying?
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:15:17
I'm very sorry for you. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 06:27:45
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:58:07
I'm starting to, the more I.learn.
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:16:19
I think you mean blockchain.
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:28:50
Y'all are just trolling at this point lol.
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:30:07
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:02:52
Wow. That's not good.
@_date: 2018-08-18 18:53:24
Update: I was able to find a cool ATM at in Nashville, but I tried sending the funds via Coinbase and it was a crypto nightmare! 
Thankfully the gentleman at Bayside Corp was very patient and has promised a refund.
@_date: 2018-08-15 04:58:08
So they just mad, huh?
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:18:12
Very cool!!! ������
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:13:24
Okay. You made your point, but there has to be some time spent to onboard more folk. But again, I wasn't even arguing, just making a statement during this bear market. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:08:51
The guy didn't sell though. You always have to sell profits.
@_date: 2018-08-29 10:07:27
Big coin energy
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:59:48
Wow! That sounds nice. Are they comfy?
