Yes, I am aware that fees are currently only contributing 1 to 2 percent of the total block reward. My point is that the bitcoin ecosystem is contributing another 12.5 bitcoin on top of fees for each block.

Not the manufacturing cost (which is lower) but the price for which a block is "sold for". I don't see much difference between a factory that consumes energy and produces aluminum vs a factory that consumes energy and produces blocks. The bitcoin factory (mine) is payed 12.5 bitcoin (plus fees) per block.

Where do you think the roughly 20 million USD paid to miners each day is coming from? 98 percent of this is the block reward, not individual transaction fees.

Can you explain why this is nonsense? A miner receives 12.5 bitcoin (125000 USD) in exchange for putting a block in the chain. This is what the entire bitcoin ecosystem is currently willing to pay for 1 MB of new data kept forever in the blockchain.

I am arguing that one year ago we were paying miners 2 million USD per day for keeping the network safe and putting 1 MB blocks in the chain. Now we are paying miners 20 million USD for the same service. If bitcoin goes to 100K, we would be paying miners 200 million USD per day for still creating 1 MB blocks.
That's perfectly fine when using bitcoin as a store of value. But it seems transacting with it also becomes 10x more expensive when the price goes up 10x.
