No, I was pricing BTC in terms of GBTC which is 1000x the price of BTC... so $1 GBTC = $1,000 BTC.

So what is your selling price? 4k, 3k, 2k, 1k, or 'hold to the grave'?

Love the analogy PPD. Gold Bugs for decades have said the intrinsic value of gold is the cost to mine the yellow metal forgetting the reason they mine the stuff is because the supply/demand price makes it profitable. Same is true for BTC.
Gold does have intrinsic value (however, forget trying to put a price tag on it) for jewelry, dental, and as a historic hedge against inflation. BTC on the other hand is just a set of numbers with zero intrinsic value.
Interesting how gold is the physical equal to digital BTC but 1/3 the price and with history and intrinsic value on its side. Give you pause as to how far BTC can fall.

BTC'ers are making the same arguments as 'Gold Bugs'. The simple fact is (relative to a few years ago) fiat...especially the USD is becoming more valuable since the Fed has moved to quantitative restriction lowering it's balance sheet and increased short-term interest rates.
The KEY advantage (from an investment point of view) for fiat is that the government issuing the fiat can pay interest whereas coins (like gold) don't. Paying an interest rate equal or above the rate of inflation makes fiat the place to be, which is the case today...but wasn't a couple of years ago when coins exploded.
Times change and when they do so best your investments.

Assume you're a rational young married individual with a couple of kids and a mortgage. If a relative dies and leaves you 10 BTC what would you do 'if you knew nothing about BTC'...except the price history. HOLD or SELL?
To mine mind the rational move would be to HOLD, if the price was going up (with a stop at the gift value), and SELL if going down. Likewise the irrational move would be to SELL if the price was going up, and HOLD if the price was falling. Step aside from what you know (or think you know) and look at the price history objectively.

Nope, meant what I said. If the USD is moving up I'm long the dollar in UUP, if down, short the dollar in UDN. How can I have emotions following what the market tells me to do. All I do is put in buy/sell orders like an idiot savant.
That said at the close today I can proudly announce I'm a bitcoin owner...sort of. Rather than waste time moving from my main investment screen I bought one share GBTC for $4.09 (1 GBTC = 1/1000 BTC + premium). As an earlier post of mine mentioned I'll be waiting for it to hit $11 over the next six month, and then add some serious money.
The $11 is a moving target and if GBTC falls further the buy price will as well.

HOW TO PSYCHOLOGICALLY SELL BTC, AND BE MENTALLY RIGHT WITH YOURSELF...
\ Bitcoin, among all the coins, is the only one patterned after gold.
\ Libertarians love bitcoin, and also gold.
\ Consider bitcoin to be a smart phone, and gold to be a landline rotary (like your gramps...me, use to use).
\ Under certain conditions the smart phone will give you better 'reception', the same is true for the landline.
\ Trade back and forth between GLD and GBTC (proxy for BTC) going to [stockcharts.com]( and entering GLD:GBTC. What you will see is the price of gold stated in terms of the price of BTC...which has been soaring as BTC has crashed. This means you currently want your money in gold.
\ When the blue and red moving averages cross, it's know as a 'death cross' for gold, meaning it's time to switch investments back to BTC.
\ This strategy lets you stay true to your Libertarian roots, and also provides a future entry price for BTC !!!
I most sincerely hope this helps.

Noticed my account custodian, Fidelity, is planning on offering coin investing opportunities in the near future so I need to set up a strategy for buying BTC/Alts (I currently trade equities, bonds, currency, commodities, and gold). Looking at the price history of GBTC and setting it to my proprietary MACD metric these are my findings:
From 5/2017 to 2/2018 GBTC was in a buy/accumulate stage which meant buying the dips made sense.
From 2/2018 to 8/2018 GBTC was in a hold/liquidate stage which meant selling the rallies made sense.
From 8/2018 to today. Sell and HODL cash, waiting for the price to recover. 
To show you how bad the technical price action for GBTC is, to entice me to buy it would need to break $11 ($11,000 BTC) over the next six months. A hell of a hurdle. Until it reaches $11 I won't touch it with a ten-foot-pole!
My worst case outcome is that in a couple of years with GBTC at $1 it might become a profitable trade for a month or two before rolling toward oblivion.
Remember it never to late to buy when something is going up, and never to late to sell when going down. W. Buffett has two rules:  Don't lose money, rule  (see rule

Catching a falling knife is not a good risk/reward decision. However it sounds like your decision wasn't rational but emotional. Money can be spent for all sorts of good emotional reasons: flowers and gifts for example which cost money you now don't have. In investing there is no, i repeat no, place for emotions. Look. You shouldn't love BTC, because BTC doesn't love you.

Sound like what a Dutch tulip bulb 'investor' would have said in May of 1637, but then the BTC bubble was way bigger than that so the numbers are comically ridiculous.
