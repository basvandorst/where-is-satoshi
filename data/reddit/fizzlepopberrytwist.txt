I convinced someone to buy in at $10k so he's caring a LOT right now.  I told him, "You will only wish you had bought more..."  Now it sounds like he's going to put some serious Benjamins in to this.  I'm talking a couple Sammy Chasers.

Yup.  That's very similar to the math I was doing and a very similar conclusion.  I have exactly 2 BTC and .7 BTC in alts and came up with $202.85 a day with a range of 0.6% to 0.85% increase daily.  Good to see some confirmation on this kind of formula.  I wasn't sure if I was high or low but I guess I'm a bit high.

I run 3 crypto subs and the FUD this past month has been brutal.  There's so much good news on the horizon so the only explanation is people holding a lot of crypto are artificially lowering the price so they can buy more right before the next big wave.  1 year ago the price of BTC was around $3000.  November 11th it was where it is now.  So how much farther ahead will it be this coming November?

Nope.  But I would sell back what I invested when it was high and keep the rest.  I remember back in 2015 or so, I spent or sold all but $15 in Dogecoin.  Now that's almost $300.  Even if only a few of these ICO's evolve in to companies that learn how to properly offer incentives to use their tokens on blockchain platforms, that's going to be huge.  Plus there's a new trend of groups that are buying out old shitcoins and rewarding bottomed out bagholders by putting more development in to them and breathing new life in to dead coins.  It happened with Unity recently and now that its DIG those coins do much better.  Long live King Bitcoin, but may the fuedal kingdoms fued well!

Last time I did something like this the company putting out a cipher test said it took an FBI agent 10 hours to solve and I did it in 4 (something like that).  Then it turned out they didn't want to hire me afterall because they were actually trying to be an all female crew and they didn't specify that before I solved their publically posted contest.  So at least there is (supposedly) a built in prize for this no matter what happens.
@_date: 2018-07-23 01:34:50
That's just it.  There is no website...
@_date: 2018-07-26 04:03:51
I guess alt-coins might not be dead as doornails afterall.

We've never met.  I just send him the code.  He doesn't know who I am or where I live.

[I posted this article over at to try and get a better handle on what systems are actually in place]( and a lot of police officers over there had some good insight on why some of it remains the way it is and misconceptions Mr. Lopp may have had about how these things are handled.

Someone tried to convince me Maserati was better.  But can it drive under a semi?  I don't think so.

Fun fact, if you bought a 2013 Ford Escape with EVERY feature, your aux port exists but is inaccessible because it is behind the computer screen, but the touch screen still says you have an aux port.

I found an issue of 2600 and used that, figured it was close enough.  Now he's trying to backtrack and say he meant versus if you owned Apple up to now which makes no sense.

I bought in to crypto starting at $2000.  I have double what I put in so far.  It's a lot.  More than my car is worth...

Okay, this is going to sound strange but... move your head to the side and then keep going until you can't see Reddit anymore.
@_date: 2018-07-26 04:25:58
No, just the first 8 years of Apple.  His argument is he's making better money on dividends and reinvestment in stock than he would bitcoin.

I usually buy it from a dude who is selling his in exchange for Amazon gift cards.

Depending on how long you've been in that coma, we have good or bad news for ya

Do you only exist online or something?  You know there's a world outside of Reddit, right?
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:19:05
I'll buy some from you.

Story time!  So I started listing my airbnb properties on cryptocribs and cross-posted to my airbnb description that I can take crypto payments through the site as long as you ask me if the dates are available on the airbnb side first.  
Time passes, zero crypto cribbers.  Then one day some couch surfing old school hacker shows up.  He mentions he would like to actually rent the couch using bitcoin next time, but his only account he has is like a "pizza fund" account.  He says he's got another one that he lost access to when his email account was frozen.  
I ask him how much was in there.  We do the math and it comes out to $175,000.  So I'm like, "Dude, you know all you have to do is fill out a recovery form for that stuff right?"  So after some trial and error, we find the right form.  Then, by sheer luck, we piece together what his old login to his Twitter account's email would be by starting the recovery process and just guessing what the blank parts were.  Boom.  Now he's got all his accounts back, massive amounts of BTC, just the Twitter linked email account wallet had like $7k alone.  All together, he's got enough to buy a house or at least start renting.
So this guy who was homeless and was about to rent from me on a daily basis until he could figure something out just up and leaves.  I never hear from him again.  Left a good review though.  
And that's how I lost a potential long-term renter.  So in my case, my sales have absolutely gone DOWN since accepting Bitcoin.  Just sayin...

[Ah of course!  The answer is so simple!](

If you were, I'd be okay with that.  The FBI owes me money for unpaid consulting fees.

There will always be motivation to develop if you plan on the world adopting crypto so you can spend it in more ways in more places :)

Well McSqueakers, since Uncle Sam is on my side I guess that's all I really need to worry about ;-)

You see the similarity though, right?  Do you see?  Do you see!?
Sorry if this was too meta.

Thanks.  I think I've thoroughly broken his soul now.  He already sold his bitcoin yesterday.

What I do is cycle my funds around in smaller percentages.  Like if it is high that day, I divide my profit by how many days its been since I first invested and just take out half of that times the amount of times I bought in.  On a down day, I buy in again for about $100.  Somehow doing this the past month I've generated .07 BTC profit.  Now that I know it works on this small scale, I might start  doubling the amount this month to see where that gets me.
