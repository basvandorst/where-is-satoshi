You are technically correct, but risk pulling too far in the other direction of the article. Just because mining operations can be located near accessible green energy sources doesn't mean that they all or even a majority are, and that in the real world a lot of carbon isn't being pumped out to run them.
The article goes a bit far in mapping out a hypothetical worst case scenario in trying to make its point, but you're going a bit far in promoting an equally unreal best case hypothetical in trying to make your counterpoint.

The idea is that, if your money is worth slightly less today than it will be tomorrow, that encourages you to spend it today, or invest it in the economy. That keeps money flowing through the system so that economy can function.
If your money is going to be worth more tomorrow than it is today, it's better to hold onto it rather than putting it to use in the economy.

Having a go at day trading when you are young is an expensive but valuable lesson for most people.

No, I'm saying that what you said is either inaccurate or irrelevant to the concern being raised. Yes, all bitcoin mining could be relocated to places where cheap, green energy is more plentiful. But that isn't where most bitcoin mining is being done and there isn't any indication that it is actually moving in the direction you propose that it could.
There is a difference between the technical capability to solve a problem existing and there not being a problem. You are conflating those things, which is intellectually dishonest. 
If bitcoin mining is actually using a significant amount of fossil-fuel generated electricity, then being concerned about the effects of that is legitimate. There are potential counter-arguments and questions that could be raised, for instance in terms of how much electricity is being used by online banking services for comparison. Maybe bitcoin is a lot more wasteful than that, maybe it isn't. I don't know. That would be an interesting place to start when discussing this issue.
What is not a valid place to start is "But bitcoin could use non-fossil-fuel energy if people wanted to, so anyone who is concerned about the burning of fossil fuels to power bitcoin mining is stupid and ignorant" because that doesn't address reality.

I... don't really care if you do or not? I save a lot and am pretty conservative with most of what I save. I allot myself a couple of thousand for "dicking around" investments. If bitcoin gets low enough, I'll throw that money at it. If it doesn't, I'll put it somewhere else.

The Taxi Driver indicator is the  reason I didn't buy into crypto back when Bitcoin was peaking in the $15k-$19k range. I'd been coming back to Bitcoin and waving off for years, saw the massive gains this year, figured "Well, I've probably missed the boat on BTC, but maybe I'll do some research on other coins and see if there is anything that looks promising." Then I went to a Christmas party where literally every other person was hawking a different coin that they were invested in so I noped right the hell out of the whole market.

Bitcoin is defending the $11k price point. It's just facing the wrong way.

I was. I'm not fully convinced of it, obviously, but after spending some time looking at the price history, I decided on $3k as my buy-in price. 
If it hits that, I'll throw a couple thousand at it. If it doesn't, I was off the mark and will content myself with nothing ventured, nothing lost and not concern myself too much with missing out on the returns.

The Wii sold more consoles than either the 360 or the PS3 by a *significant* amount. It was Nintendo's comeback after Sony took away Nintendo's dominance in previous console generations.
Nintendo failed to fully take advantage of their success with the Wii and seriously shot themselves in the foot with the WiiU, but in no universe was the Wii responsible for Nintendo being taken down as the big name in game consoles. That had already happened much earlier and the Wii had the opposite effect of temporarily helping to reverse a falling trend.

People shouldn't get screened for cancer in case it gives them a false sense of security that they are well since they could still develop cancer after the screening.

You invested more than you can afford to lose, and BTC is still above where you invested.
Why aren't you pulling out money until you only have money left in that you can afford to lose? Your returns won't be as large if the price spikes again, but you won't be getting yourself into financial trouble if it flattens, either.

In what world was Nintendo's slide from dominance the result of putting out the Wii?

Yes, but if I wanted people to believe it, I’d find some other source to quote.
