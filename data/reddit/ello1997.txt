That's funny maybe try to eat your feedback as a way to further your station in life. I wouldn't call telling some goon on reddit to get thicker skin an argument, simply an expression of opinion. You're feelings get hurt very easily I'm sorry you're having such a rough evening.

You're favorite line. Why not unintelligent? What about mentally inferior, or selectively stupid etc etc. you call everyone a child, I'm guessing, because you do not have the intellectual prowess to come up with something better. Yeah I'm 38, yes I still act childish at times--good call that's what keeps me young

You're a minor annoyance. I let you irritate me for about a minute yesterday until I realize you are mentally defective. I'm Good to go over here. Please seek some professional help before you hit or hurt someone severely.

Some fella on this thread calls everyone he disagrees with "a child!" I was simply giving him a few more options if trolling is going to be his hobby might as well go all in. Good post have a great day!
I suck at reddit the few times I do comment or post, it's usually in the wrong place or something. Nothing to see here carry on!

Just trying to keep u flapping your gums at this point. At least 80 percent of what you say to others on here could and should be applied to your own situation. This is truly comical with a side of depressing. How much longer can he go?

You could literally justify your hypocrisy and bullshit fifteen different ways. It is unfortunate you don't use your intelligence for positive means: a moment to self reflect, possibly re-read some of your reddit ramblings for introspection, review accusations you've thrown around on here, simply to make sure You aren't doing the very same thing--aka avoiding hypocrisy. I doubt you are capable of said self-help and therefore I take pity on your soul. Please do leave me alone you are highly annoying. You will never hear from me again after I post your hypocrisy on r/quityourbullshit after I eat.

"i'm not a grown adult starting arguments with people on Reddit because I can't control my feelings about politically charged comments."---are you for real? This is YOU that you just described. Lol. I've asked you to quit pestering me. You are unable to leave me alone. It is very obvious your feelings about politics are uncontrollable, you can't help it I understand. I feel sorry for you but I understand nonetheless. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:02:55
Aka butthurt
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:27:22
Says the misinformed dipstick who thinks I was talking politics, when really I was just looking to see if the guy was going to eat his testicle. You are an unfortunate soul. You've talked so much about politics I'm bout ready to go ahead and join in you are so obviously enthusiastic about talking politics when I said nothing in regard to such endeavors.  I'm certain you have water on the brain. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:35:31
Childish would be better unless you really are simply a moron. is calling a 38 year old a child supposed to hurry my feelers? That's like telling someone "you are a horse!" and expecting this to upset them lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:47:54
Its not funny at all someone with your level of insecurity and anger issues is like a kettle bomb waiting to explode. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:12:05
No worries. I have to constantly remind myself that for every troll on here, there are a dozen decent, kind, altruistic human beings. Hope you have a great weekend. 
I also have to pose the question to myself from time to time: what does it say about me when I let a stranger on the internet upset me? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:15:17
You're a riot- but I wish you weren't having such a tough time. You've clearly gone astray at some point today, letting yourself get carried away, endlessly ranting and raving over a posting about a guy eating his testicle if bitcoin reaches a certain level.  I don't revel in the misery or hypocrisy of others-but in your case I'll make an exception. This is too funny ��

All because I said you are easily butthurt lol. Have you ever been able to receive criticism without flying off the handle? I've never seen someone online with such thin skin who is as willing as you are to be hypocritical. You've said every hateful thing in the book to me, I honestly feel like you need to seek help buddy please don't injure or hurt anyone between now and when you get some professional help-as we have all seen how easily you are angered. That's not healthy please seek help immediately don't hurt anyone please
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:31:24
Maybe re-read the thread, you will find that you are mistaken.  There is nothing political, not one single word. You're delusional my friend. Please quit pestering me
