Not sure you know how statistics work. Exact same thing happened in Thailand recently, and it's fine to own guns here.
You are not going to be a hero, you are going to get yourself or a family member hurt.
Can you get to your gun quick enough? Do you sleep in the same room as the rest of your family? 
Will you recognise the correct target before it comes around the door and gets a shot off, or was is that your teenage son stumbling around drunk.

He was ridiculed as an egotistical rich kid living off daddies money long before his most recent election run.
The bloke has been a joke for decades, he just wasn't president so didn't need so much screen time.
I suppose back when he was supporting Hilary for president he could still string a sentence together in an interview

Why are you so obsessed with black men fucking wife's? Sounds very insecure to me.
See I trust my gf, and happy with the size of my cock.
Perhaps you have issues with those things and so worry about a fictional black man fucking your wife better that you ever could, im not.
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:56:44
Just no
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:33:45
Ah yes the good old if you remove the crime there is no crime. Its laughable
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:31:11
Next generation lol, you're the last cry of a dieing breed.
Also the idea you said nothing inflammatory is as hilarious as the idea of you being a decent human being.

Oh look a collection of anecdotal evidence to re-enforce personal bias and no actual answer to my questions, next you will be telling me that the USA is safer than any other developed country (as long as you remove all the major population centers)

Urg almost makes me want to sell, but im a pro globalist democratic socialist liberial, so obviously crypto currencies go hand in hand with my politics.
Not sure how these Donald clowns fit it in to their ideals but I guess that cultism is one hell of a drug

Well I'm wrong but There needs to be a term for the middle because that a huge gap in wealth
@_date: 2018-09-01 14:55:20
Well in London s place like that your looking probably in the 10s of millions, assuming this is central.
Generally a millionaire would move further out to have something about the same only not central.
It's also likely that it at there is a modern underground extension that all the mega rich are doing now due to the listings on the buildings
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:27:13
Sorry for the downvote it's not me.
But I will say it again, millionaires don't buy houses worth 10s of millions.
It's too much a % of their assets. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 02:44:46
Think this was already established and got to sleep it's 3.45am
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:48:28
Yes but millionaires don't buy houses worth 10s of millions. At least not ones that wish to stay millions.
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:34:44
That's an old school English billion even in England we refer to a BN and 100 million now.

"COIN WARS" i think can only be a good thing, a bit of friendly competition, bitching and one-upmanship can only lead to the promotion and greater usage of all alt coins involved. it should be encouraged as look as people are level headed about it.
congratulate them and then throw out a jokey insult followed by trying to do something even greater.

Popularist politics can't be extreme. Lol.
You're having a fucking laugh m8, most fascist dictatorships start as popularist movements.
That is litterially the lesson we are supposed to have learnt from the world war when people say 'remember'.
