Bitcoin is becoming centralized by the miners. Eventually some corrupt ass on wall street in going to own most of the bitcoins. Monero will take longer to become centralized because you won’t have most coins being owned by the largest mining operations.
This is just my rationalization, if I’m wrong please correct me.

Bitcoin is a store of value, not a medium of exchange. This is what everyone gets wrong about bitcoin. This was the way it was meant to be. Gold is heavy and difficult to transport as is bitcoin. Large transactions is he way it was meant to be. Look to alt-coins as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2018-08-06 07:51:13
Mine monero! Absolutely ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) resistant so you should always be able to mine it with a normal computer! 
ASICs makes mining incredibly expensive in terms of hardware and electrical costs. 
Whenever they finally produce a cryptonite V7 (hashing algorithm for monero) ASIC, the developers will change the hashing algorithm, rendering all that expensive effort worthless for bitmain. 
Bitmain has a monopoly on ASIC miners.

Ben Shapiro doesn’t like Bitcoin because he’s likely part of the elite who drills into the pipeline of the economy and sucks out as much as he can get away with.
Bitcoin will ensures you can get away with far less when you try creating some crappy derivative, fraction reserve banking, quantitative easing, or anything else that creates value by devaluing everyone’s real money.

Bitcoin needs no regulators or third party therefore it cannot be frozen, seized, or embezzled if you are the only person who knows the private key. 
If governments or banks creates create a currency they would want control over the funds through inflation and regulation. They would design it so that it could be seized or frozen.

@_date: 2018-10-29 06:01:09
Do you really not understand. Do some research. In less than 2 years it will be 6.25 per block. It will keep splitting causing the price of mining to go up. The creation of blocks are incredibly expensive so it's not like printing fiat money, where you can mass produce fancy paper or create new debt. There is also a maximum supply. Eventually there will be no new bitcoin's to be created.

He means bitcoin's utility can be created and inflated with altcoins. 
I love Bitcoin but I haven't heard a good argument about it's utility being abundant in altcoins.
Bitcoin is valuable because of it's history and being the first of it's kind. It has a decade head start in use. It's utility is however not scarce.

Bitcoin is NOT private, its a public tool. There are no restrictions to accessing Bitcoin. The network is completely and mathematically impartial, anything that knows how to use the internet can access Bitcoin.
Governments cannot shut it down otherwise it already would have been. You clearly still don’t understand Bitcoin do some due diligence.

A store of value needs to be difficult to change. If updates come and go willy nilly like for an iPhone app it would be subject to terrible bugs and malicious designs, making it worthless. 
Hardness is important for a store of value. Every update must be as secure as possible and extremely precise. 
Implementing new features and capabilities on Bitcoin is more delicate than heart surgery, one wrong move the entire network could be done for. 
This is why open source is the best governance structure for Bitcoin development. Anyone can introduce an update to Bitcoin core but nobody has to upgrade. Every aspect of Bitcoin is voluntary and transparent making it truly a free market phenomenon.
This market is not a 100 meter dash. Its a multi decade marathon. Patience has always been greatly rewarded in Bitcoin.

If they commandeer all Chinese mining pools with force they will have well over 80% of all hashing power. Low cost way to preform 51% attack. They could double spend transactions before anyone notices and changes pools.

I am less concerned with the environmental impact of Bitcoin. The world banking system uses far more electricity than Bitcoin. When Bitcoin replaces the financial system Bitcoin energy consumption will be offset. PoW is a crucial ingredient in Bitcoin. Power consumption is a tangible part of Bitcoin that has immense psychological pressure on Bitcoin’s value. All forms of money and financial assets require psychological pressure in order to be perceived as valuable.

That is wrong. Market adoption means its beneficial for the buyers. This could be really disastrous for people who don’t get in (most people). All their savings would be wiped out and Bitcoin could be a scapegoat for the ignorant masses.

If Bitcoin replaces banks how will we lend money to people? Borrowers must pay back everything they owe. If one person defaults everyone is fucked.
Money will become stagnant and venture capital would be impossible.
A lot of good things come from cheap money. The  current banking system protects people from bankruptcy of others. I am aware of the abuses in the system.
The economy will become Stagnant, aquiring funds to start a business would become impossible unless you have Bitcoin. Buisnesses with temperary economic issues would not be able to stay afloat in economic recessions. Why would you risk your money on a business when your money is always increasing in value.

You need to understand human psychology. The scarcity and the hashing power make Bitcoin difficult and inefficient to use but this makes Bitcoin seem more valuable due to the cost of production. Taxes, expensive tx fees, and being expensive to run makes it seem more valuable. Bitcoin also discourages use and encourages HODLing. Things that are scarce and expensive to produce are perceived as more valuable. Bitcoin is also the hardest crypto. It’s the most difficult to upgrade which is good and bad. Bitcoin will eventually adopt everything useful in other cryptos but very slowly and deliberately. Bitcoin is not for testing new features and capabilities. It’s hard to improve but being hard to change does make it more reliable as a store of value. Bitcoin is volatile because its only ten years and a brand new asset class.

Saying Bitcoin is not tangible is like saying the internet is not tangible. I’ve used Bitcoin, I know how to use it, and I know how it works. There are millions of computers running a copy of the Bitcoin ledger. There’s electricity being consumed by the network. There’s hashing power defending Bitcoin and hashing power is being rewarded handsomely. There’s a community of developers and a cult following on the internet. The community creates a global culture that ties us all together. We can fight off malicious forks and negative press coverage. Bitcoin is more tangible than gold because Bitcoin is the people surrounding it not just the software. TCP/IP is nothing with out the people using it and developing it. Gold is rock money. Fiat is institutional money. Bitcoin is peer to peer network money. If fiat can surpass gold market cap then so can Bitcoin!

Bitcoin cash suggests larger block sizes for scaling which wont wont work.

How could you possibly have switched away from banks at this point? You have never even parted with the banks. If you want fast payments, use a credit card. Credit cards are great for customers and terrible for merchants. Credit cards forces all merchants to raise prices to cover for charge backs and fees. Also the merchants do not get debited for a month after the transaction.
Decentralization and security are more important than scaling. Speed is not the point of Bitcoin.

I like your commitment but sometimes you’ll need a large sum of fiat on demand and if the price is down you’ll need to sell at a loss. You need to finance this properly.

Gold is not the most useful metal but it’s the most valuable. This is still true after thousands of years.
Bitcoin is not the most useful Crypto but it is the most valuable. This will still be true after our sun dies.

Yes but those metals are not desired by most people throughout history. Those metals have special technical applications and are too scarce. Those metals are not expensive because of demand is what I’m trying to say.

Blockchain are much slower than central servers. The true innovation of Bitcoin is cutting out financial intermediaries.

Facebook stocks is a share in a company that nothing new. 
Bitcoin is something completely new like when the first equity contract was written, the first insurance contract, the first gold bullion minted, or the first note backed by gold issued by a King or emperor.

People still don’t understand the point of Bitcoin. The main purpose of Bitcoin is cutting out all financial intermediaries including central banks that issue government fiat. They can buy Bitcoin but they will no longer be able to print new money at the expense of everyone else. They will not be able to create derivative contracts and sell them anymore. They can create derivatives backed by Bitcoin but why would you buy a contract saying you own it when they can just send it to you directly at very little cost. The market cap of Bitcoin currently is not a threat but it could become one very quickly, when Bitcoin’s market cap surpasses Gold it becomes an immediate threat on their door step.

Don’t use Coinbase. Everyone who leaves their keys with a third party will eventually get slaughtered. Use a hardware wallet ideally otherwise you can leave it on your computer but that’s also really risky since it can get hacked.

That was not my intention sometimes my post doesn’t get as much replies as I would like.

What else could people flock too? Gold? How are people going to do international trade with gold? Its slow, Expensive to transport, expensive to verify at enormous qualities and at micro quantities, and kind dangerous. You need to trust third parties which caused the crisis in the first place. Alts? Lets not kid ourselves, Alts kinda suck. There are no other options really.
