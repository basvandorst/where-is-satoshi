You just made that up didn’t you?

Can’t think of a time these idiots have been right 
Think it’s going the opposite way when I read this 
They are just looking for sheep to dump on most likely, don’t know why anybody listens to them
The DCB from 3k is over lol

Those Winkeltards tried to get through an ETF repeatedly using their own exchange as the price feed - how shallow is your analysis that you think these fucking idiots are any better than the morons that run the legacy economy?

Because they can’t ��

JPM Coin - no more of those pesky fines and regulator oversight, with shielded transactions you can now launder your drug child prostitute money quickly and easily. Coming soon JPM card, simply send your maid, butler or other captive down to the ATM machine and withdraw up to 3million per day anonymously

No - just because you are too dumb to realise the reasons for him being an idiot and those reasons being too obvious to elucidate on..

Could not find any trace of theirs ‘Correct the Net’ company

KYC  works on plebs i.e. retail investors as another layer to surveillance capitalism - if you have enough reason to be avoiding detection you simply get a proxy to do it for you like NK does with SG

Guy is a fucking idiot and should be an embarrassment to the whole space

Buy and forget - the most successful investors are dead people 
Get on with your life
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:17:44
Probably not 
It’s good that you are seeking out this advice though
Maybe read Eugénie Grandet by Honoré Balzac and learn what opportunity cost is in a philosophical context

It’s worth a shot - lol

It’s enthralling but really you are better off not getting too autistic about it. There are peaks and troughs that you can make an Absolute killing on but at the end of the day the most important investment you can make is in your own personal development, not charts
JIC you thought I was kidding 
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:32:07
Now thats a store of value

 What do you think? 
Its a good question although you could be more specific

Fucking depressing

A few years before you
Arthur has all the BTC now
It literally seems to be a minimal amount of retail investors and a whole load of bots / exchanges trying to liquidate customers

I like BCH btw _ not so much

.. and got trapped. Daily close was meh failed to make a bullish engulfing - look forward to seeing the reasons why they reject the ETF this time. Do you really think that they will approve anything while USDT and BFX are under investigation .. seems unlikely
