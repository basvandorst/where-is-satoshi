Tip: Don’t do it
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:49:37
Other than the "don't date" part, the changes your friend has undergone do seem positive!

Both have good reputation and wide selection of coins.  Binance is more aggressive at listing new coins and their fees are lower.  Bittrex has higher trading volume an is organized in the USA so risk profile is arguably lower.

Transfer your money to GDAX.  It is controlled by Coinbase so you use the same login credentials.  Limit orders have zero commission and transfers are mostly free.

If you think what has happened so far is a failure by the BCH pumpers you are mistaken.  The pumpers already made so much money from this pump.  They are counting their profits now and will come back soon with an even more painful attack on BTC.

If BTC dies, something stronger and more resilient will certainly rise from the ashes . . .

Really wish the two sides had reached some sort of compromise that could have avoided this knife fight.  I don’t believe this fork FUD is good for the Crypto space. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:53:03
That’s odd.  GDAX is owned by Coinbase which means most people are able to log into GDAX.com with their Coinbase credentials.  If that doesn’t work then the other  popular exchanges with fiat depositing capabilities in the USA are Gemini and Kraken.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:40:19
More fees solves the issue ASAP.  Sending with small fee while BCH is rising will ensure your funds will float in limbo

Oh man, we are dead.  Our beautiful BTC!

You must not know much about the crypto miners in China.  The most profitable plants are currently using hydro power.  The reason why is because China over built dams and many were not operating at full capacity since there was not enough local demand for electricity.  Miners show up, the hydro generators start running longer.

Yes. It is no different to renting a space, buying alcohol from a wholesaler, then selling individual bottles of liquor to the public.  Even if you pay taxes on the profit, you would risk getting shutdown for operating without a liquor license.

No way in hell is the attack on BTC over.  Think about how much the BCH backers made from the pump of dump.  That money will be deployed again to rob the market

If BTC dies or is permanently handicapped, an alt must rise.

This may be the only thing that can save BTC!

Coinbase is a reputable firm.  One of the best options there is for US-based investors specifically.

BTC back up above $3400 on GDAX.  Buy and hold is likely the best long term strategy unless you want to play the dangerous trading game.  
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:56:57
It's apparently also difficult for crypto exchanges to operate in WA (they have to maintain a license which involves fees).  Seems like the state is backwards about online activities.  Doesn't make sense given that WA is the home of MSFT and AMZN.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:36:52
To clarify: you want to consider investing in a crypto hardware wallet.  Software wallets are not nearly as safe.

You can log  onto GDAX with your Coinbase credentials.  On GDAX you can trade with zero fees if you use limit orders.

Not sure if true but an interesting read.  Decent fan fiction at worst haha

GDAX is the simplest answer if you already have a Coinbase account

Wall Street coming essentially means more bot trading and price manipulation.  I am not looking forward to that day since the exchanges are largely unregulated.  Will have to be pure buy and hodl when the robots invade!

This is the third blockchain.info user who has lost their BTC in the last two weeks.  I would stay away.
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:53:55
Coinbase / GDAX is one of the most reputable exchanges there is.  I am having money depositing money with them right now but am confident it'll get worked out since Coinbase seems to be professionally run.  Who knows though. Maybe I will be singing a different tune if my money is in limbo one week later . . .

GDAX is great. I had one issuing with depositing money but it was resolved within 3 days.  Now things working great again.

It is unlikely China will close the two largest exchanges.  The back-and-forth news is just providing air cover for the Chinese whales to sell ahead of news and buy from those too weak to hold onto their crypto as prices dip.

If something looks too good to be true it is likely an illusion.  You money is almost certainly gone.

Coinbase/GDAX and Bittrex works fine.  Use GDAX for deposits and use Bittrex to trade the smaller coins not listed on GDAX.

Fees not attractive at all.

It is probably safe but why risk your crypto stack just to save a few bucks?

Question:  You find it worthwhile to buy on LBC?  I have checked the prices there a few times and it didn't look much better than the exchanges if you buy/sell with cash.

There is no known instance of Trezor or Nano S being hacked.  The only way people have lost money with those devices is user error (e.g., losing their seed or having it stolen).
That said, I also recommend Ledger Blue.

You severely underestimate the Chinese Communist Party.   All they have to do is pull one or two of the big mining owners aside and tell them the government will make them the richest men in crypto but they have to work for the Party and to further the national interest.

For that small amount I would just leave it on Coinbase/GDAX.  For larger amounts invest in a hardware wallet.  I would not recommend storing on any of the online wallets generally.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:19:57
This is why it was recommended to move BTC off exchanges prior to the fork.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:58:42

@_date: 2017-10-06 04:23:16
Second this

That is indeed what he is saying.  I do not recommend paper unless you are very tech savvy.  Lots can go wrong.  The hardware wallets are more idiot proof.

Yes, if it gets a decent size market and is proven to be legit I don't see why people wouldn't use it over LBC.  The big issue is whether new entrants can effectively deal with disputed trades.  LBC okay on that front.
The problem is the prices on LBC have gotten so competitive that it is much harder to make money now and therefor the fees are getting painful do to the tighter margins.  
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:12:55
Momentum moving in the right direction boys!

The miners in China are apparently paying as low as $0.03 per kWH or less so their electricity costs are not that high.  Given how the price of crypto has appreciated this year I doubt any of the miners are desperate for money.
