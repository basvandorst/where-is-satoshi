Exactly. I like how people assume we haven't looked into "it"

I just engaged in BitCommerce by purchasing a pizza, stuffed jalapeños, and a coke from a place in Hayward, CA using Foodler.com. I feel like I am contributing to a financial market system that does not support wars of aggression or financial consolidation. This is good IMO.

I gave my roommate .000341 BTC because "I wanted to see it work". We both just bought our first coins after hearing about it on and off for a while.

Does seem to be becoming a trend? Is there an explanation? Seems like really bad code or shenanigans. I'm no expert.

It worked for me all day. Probably being overrun by users in Asia. Figur$$$. Wait, it's 6:30 am in Europe. Lots of people waking up and checking numbers?

I was able to log in after deleting cookies. Thanks So, now I am having difficulties transferring funds to my other wallet. It leaves coinbase but it doesn't arrive or even indicate an open order.

I signed up for a BitcoinTip address but it says my balance is $0. Did something go wrong?

Now it is getting shorter. Earlier it went from 50 minutes to 2 hours to 12 hours to 17 hours and now it's back to 46 minutes. Is coinbase getting hit hard today by withdrawals? I'm just messing around with dogecoins.

In my coinedup wallet it shows the transaction with "no" under confirmed. Each time I go to blockchain.info 'The Estimated Confirmation Time' keeps getting longer. It is also showing a portion as spent. Thanks for any learnings you can provide ;-)

You made an invalid statement immediately. OWS was NOT for the FED.

Thank you for that songkran. It's just so much to relate and I'm usually too wordy anyway. I'll probably do as you suggested and start sharing videos. To tell you the truth, the Satoshi White Paper really made it all make sense to me. That was why I suggested it. Thanks again.

Very interesting. So much learning! How wonderful it is to feel like you are beginning to grasp an economic system.

For me BTC is an alternative that lets me spend the money my time has been spent earning more ethically than Fiat Currency. I am extremely grateful for BTC giving me the ability to not support Wars of Aggression or Colonialism or Imminent Domain or Too Big To Fails. Thank you BTC.

Wow! I've never received a BTC Tip before! Thank you man and thank you for your artwork and BTC activism.

Hey at least you're omniscient. That's cool. Maybe he/she didn't know to look for integration.

If this writer is going to talk about concentrated wealth be should at least compare BTC to USD. Because the USD has a little problem with concentrated wealth.

Can someone address the idea that it is a good plan to invest in something China heavily covets? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:12:52
People wanna spend their mBTCs! Yay!
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:34:18
Isn't the "Undeniable Proof of Payment" as brought up in a recent post reason enough? Believe it or not, there is more to base BTC on than the US$. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:32:26
Thank you for your comment. This was all just a little off the top. I am also a beginner having researched BTC on and off for a year and only been actively involved for a few weeks. My family is actually focused on ethical concerns over money so the focus of the message does strike the right strings with the targeted audience. Real people, with normal jobs, DO care about all of those things you poo-poo'd at the end there. It is ALL that matters. Creating a currency separated from the Military Industrial Complex and trade agreements like NAFTA and the TPP is ALL that matters.
