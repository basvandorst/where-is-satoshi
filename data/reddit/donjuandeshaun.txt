You can't have it both ways.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:40:42
We'll see.

Someone is selling huge amounts of bitcoin on Sundays during quiet trading periods.  It's freaking the market out and it doesn't recover during the following week.  It's happened 2 weeks in a row now.
I believe it will continue to happen until addressed.  Either he is dropping the price to buy low and sell high during the week or taking a loss just to destroy the confidence in bitcoin.
Either way, confidence in bitcoin will deteriorate rapidly because of it.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:45:15
They already rate limit.  They did it for a valid reason.
Well why have bitcoin at all if there's nothing wrong with our current free system.  You know money is created by the free market right?  You didn't think the Federal Reserve was part of the government did you?  Clearly they are free market according to your logic and the dollar is perfectly fine.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:15:26
I trust the protocol more than anything else.  
@_date: 2013-06-06 10:54:21
No need to buy bitcoin until this is fixed.  They will just take your money.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:14:17
No they were still in diapers.  You ok man?
@_date: 2013-06-06 12:58:37
Hurray for the so-called free market--the death of bitcoin.
See you boys at zero.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:20:50
That makes NO sense.  I'm here to raise an alarm.  We need to watch this pattern.
It's not a "free market" if everyone can't game the system.  Think about that for a bit.
I like bitcoin because it's open source money that no one will ultimately control through "unfair" means.
I am concerned with adoption.  Eroding confidence slows adoption.  That's the game that's being played now.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:36:43
I'm sure they'll hold but they won't tell their family about their bad investment.  We'll see if this problem goes away or if bitcoin does.
@_date: 2013-06-06 04:58:33
I hope you're right.  If they keep doing this though, bitcoin will be driven down to zero and no one will be interested.
Theoretically, the advantage is that it retains value and possibly increases. 
It's not working that way right now.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:38:50
I know there's only 11+ million.  It doesn't matter if bitcoin is gamed so heavily by very rich people.  It'll still go to zero.
@_date: 2013-06-06 14:48:04
Yeah..the idiot mods keep deleting it.  It's the truth and the community needs to consider it.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:12:34
That statement is groundless based on pure logic.  If nobody sells then the price will stay exactly where it is.  Think about that for a sec.
Now, if fewer people sell, the price would go up if folks kept buying at a rapid pace.
Don't believe everything some guy says with confidence.
Strong but wrong.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:16:53
That's what a 1 percenter would say.  You assume confidence will drop simply because an exchange is rate limited.
Rate limiting does not limit overall sells unless very unusual events occur with some 1 percenter gaming the overall system.
It's not a free market when only the 1 percenters can play those games.
@_date: 2013-06-06 10:40:14
Whale Drop Sunday is the biggest.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:39:56
Keep watching.  If the problem isn't fixed you may pay to give it away.
@_date: 2013-06-06 12:57:37
Stay tuned every Sunday and Monday.  Going down to zero boys until it's fixed.
Say what you like.

I mine litecoins and sell them for bitcoins.  I also bought bitcoins and am holding.
I'm a true believer--or bag holder depending on your viewpoint.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:42:36
I thought that at first too.  I also am a bit of a conspiracy theorist too.  It's been two weeks in a row now though.
I think uvwvj was right with his first post.
Maybe if MORE 1 percenters get in, it'll be harder to do?
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:42:41
Its just a pattern to watch.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:01:11
I think Gox should limit large sells.  And rate limit hourly sells if this pattern continues to drain confidence.
Else, they may not have a business in a few months.
@_date: 2013-06-06 13:00:44
No need for it then.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:33:24
Hive mind doesn't make it right.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:09:52
Rich people didn't run it up.  Don't assume you know everything.  You were only POSSIBLY right about the 1 percenter dropping the huge btc sell to induce panic and buy lower.
Your cockiness isn't deserved based on your posts.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:16:59
Hmm...so Gox is already rate limiting.  Looks like it might be useful after all.
Time to review that policy.
@_date: 2013-06-06 12:38:07
Make sure you mention Whale Drop Sunday.  The Chinese shouldn't buy until this problem is fixed.  People are just losing money.  Every Monday the price will be down 10 bucks and will not recover the following week.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:28:55
Lol.  Ok.  Derp.  I have friends that bought at 134.  They did not make money.  Do you think they are going to tell their friends?  Hell no. 
Drops like that scare people and it's too easy for these asses to do it.
No one's getting into bitcoin when it's so easy to drop down and so predictable.  Therefore...it's heading down, down, down til it's fixed.
@_date: 2013-06-06 13:03:05
Just making folks aware.  If this doesn't get deleted--again.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:20:52
You'll be able to get all you like at 0 and hold them forever.
