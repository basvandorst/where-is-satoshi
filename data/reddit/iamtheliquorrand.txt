I like the second to last sentence. Like most things, demand dictates price, and bitcoin is worth what people will pay for it. I don't like the argument that Bitcoin isn't backed by anything. I would counter that stance by asking what the intrinsic value of gold really is? I believe in Bitcoin and what it stands for, and I most certainly am in it for the long haul. Been accumulating and HODLing for nearly 2 years now and in that time I have learned a lot about the market and most importantly, leave emotion at the door.

Nope. I've given up on trading all together, but my only successes in the past were following the 50 day moving average and buying/selling near the perceived support/resistance levels. Final straw for me was selling at what I thought was the new resistance level LITERALLY MINUTES before a $1,700 24 hr bull run commenced. That was very painful to watch but I couldn't look away.

Thank you for the reply. This is very insightful and far more articulate than anything else I've read TBH.

I agree that this is likely the reality of "whales", however, I have a bit of a conspiratorial theory that several of the largest whales have all found each other over the internet. It seems feasible to me that in such a scenario, these whales could coordinate mass sell offs to drive the price down artificially. They then wait for the price to drop to a predetermined level, and buy the same amount of bitcoin, driving the price back up and pocketing the difference...I think this probably does happen, but not at the scale some articles I've read claim.

Bitcoin has only been around for 11 years. Not talking about TA for the stock market. That said, with so many unknowns, potential for manipulation, and the psychology of the masses (i.e. FOMO and then panic), the Bitcoin market is it's own beast and there's not much in the way of data that can predict any sort of trends accurately

This is my favorite response so far. When I first started buying in and doing research, I tried and miserably failed to follow short term trends. In the relatively short term, now I feel like the only real indicator of when to buy or sell is based on response to an externality. Negative press about bitcoin, buy the dip. positive press (president of china), sell and rebuy when the market corrects. Personally, I've given up on this and like I said, just buy the dip.
