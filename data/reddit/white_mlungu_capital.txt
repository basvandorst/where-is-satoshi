The problem with bitcoin is shady exchange operators who steal

The main problem with crypto is not actually crypto, it is people.  Specifically, people running the exchanges who are either getting hacked, stealing from customers or just plain out unreliable.  So many servers have gotten hacked or turned out to be frauds and walked off with millions, and even a hard wallet doesn't make you immune to this as people are getting their crypto stolen on exchanges by the operators like we saw in Canada with Gary.  You eventually have to sell your crypto or buy it, and that is where the risk is once it goes to the exchange and the processing time, is when you get your money stolen.  It happened to literally 10k+ people just on one exchange.  Not to mention mt.gox.

Oil is far less volatile than Bitcoin or most other currencies.  It is a non-renewable resource, more of it is not being made in sufficiently cheap volumes to compete.  Even if America could get electric cars right, the rest of the world is not rich to that extent.  Further oil is used far beyond just gasoline.
It is to help him circumvent sanctions, that is the whole point of crypto, to be beyond the reach of government, to be a currency where Uncle Sam doesn't get to dictate the terms to the world of how others spend their money.

It was not a bad idea, a currency backed by a resource is logical.

It takes time to withdraw, sometimes people even lost money before they could withdraw or when they were trying to buy or sell.  or after they sold and faced delays from the exchange.  $30 million stuck in processing on a Canadian exchange, even if they all had wallets, people still lost their crypto.
