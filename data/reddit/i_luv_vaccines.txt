I'm just curious about **if** forks will even exist if Satoshi came public, not that I am in any way supporting forks of Bitcoin.

Ouchhhh your moon money is below $5500. How do you like me now bro?
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:22:18
Okay moonboy. Keep being delusional.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:57:49
Wait, you mean that we're -71% since 2017? 
Fuck outta here moonboy.
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:43:04
Yeah sorry you lost 71% of your money.
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:21:59
So you're just parroting what everyone said in 2017?
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:50:03
Wait, but why is your glorious moon money worth 71% less?
How do you like me now *broooooooo*?
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:18:27
Yeah id rather have the gold.
@_date: 2019-04-24 13:24:37
Yeah you buying at $20k sucks.
Please talk to someone
@_date: 2019-04-20 21:22:37
Well, price action is nice, but I want to have some insight on what the network as a whole will happen, not necessarily what the price will be.
* i.e. will Bitcoin Cash exist? (Probably not)
* i.e. will Craig Wright still be an asshole? (Probably)
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:27:50
Only -71%
@_date: 2019-04-24 12:50:56
Ohhhh so you only brag when the market is down 71%, not when its down 75%...
Got it. Amazing logic moonboy
@_date: 2019-04-24 13:03:25
Why arent you bragging about the price of bitcoin anymore?
You okay?
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:24:58
I guess you were asleep for the past year then

I love how this is a real problem, yet you are getting downvoted for it.
If we want to see mass adoption, imagine the huge amounts of transaction fees that will rack up.

tO bE fAiR!!!!
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:48:12
No we're not moonboy.
@_date: 2019-05-02 09:47:45
People say that Bitcoin is going to go to $1MM, yet we had to pay $20+ in transaction fees when Bitcoin was just $20k. It amazes me that people don't think of this as an issue.
