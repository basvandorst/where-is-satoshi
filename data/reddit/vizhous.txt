Look, nothing against bitcoin, it should definitely be part of a crypto portfolio, but I hope you don't put it all in btc. It has its negatives and positives. Diversifying in multiple cryptos would be safer and it's not really like other cryptos didn't have as much growth as btc. A lot can happen in 10/15 years.

This isn't even about btc vs bcash... It's about someone going allin on something. 100% in btc is exactly as stupid as 100% bcash was in this case. Just because we now know how it played out doesn't make it any better to be 100% btc. Just do research and diversify.

Hey, sorry but I don't think I'm the best one to give you advice for that. I would just say in general you shouldn't go all in in bitcoin and atleast have an even part in eth. You'll definitely need a lot of time to research all the other promising coins besides the 2 big ones. Good luck with that!

Yea definitely. I guess you'll find a lot of different opinions which are often 100% btc/eth/whatever, depending on the subreddit and you'll need to form your own opinion. I just looked around a bit since I got interested in what kind of other opinions are out there and I agree a lot with this article  As long as you can block their annoying register popup haha.

Yea, I got rid of it by blocking javascript with uBlock but then the next page button disappears too and i have to manually type the next number in the url... haha
No problem!
