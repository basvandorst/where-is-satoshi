Just brilliant.

I see an analogy between printing press and the internet. But between Bitcoin and printing press, I don’t. That Bitcoin may bring some societal change, definitely, like all successful technologies. But that it works similarly to printing press and the internet. I don’t see it. But I’m open to see it.
Edit; Antonopoulos’s Internet of money is something that hasn’t materialized in relation to bitcoin. Which in a way supports my argument Bitcoin != printing press/internet. However, I see the internet of value in relation to blockchain, far beyond BTC.

This still doesn’t help the people inside.

How is Bitcoin working similarly to a VPN?

Guns don’t protect you from military control by government. Government will always have more power than you. Ask the Wacos.

It’s a rather weak analogy. There has to be some similarity between one and the other. And I don’t see it, except that both are on the Internet.

That’s probably the suit of the Apollo 13.

Probably this will be trolled and downvoted. Ethereum developers are finalising a project for assigning domains to addresses. It's called ENS (Ethereum Name System), and it will work as you described. It should be put to work end of May or early July. The whole system (name registration and assignment) works with smart contracts, so it is decentralised. So far it can't be connected to the main ICANN domain system, until a first level domain is not approved (i.e. .eth), but it's on road map. Until then it will fully work within the Ethereum ecosystem (Virtual Machine, Swarm, Whisper and DApps).

Blockchain is here to stay. Bitcoin is Compuserve.
