I don’t think I said anything about forked coins, I didn’t buy bitcoin before the fork and have no interest in bitcoin cash after it either. My questions is about how they store your coins
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:50
Ya that’s definitely the plan, but the ledger nano is backordered. It’s looking like my best option is gonna be to transfer funds from coinbase to a paper wallet and just track the keys myself until I can pick one up.

This is not an appeal to tradition, there is no established “this is how it’s always been done so we can’t change now”. I knew when that damn fallacy chart was reposted again we’d see a bunch of people falsely writing off arguments as fallacies. The OP is extrapolating data based on historical trends to make a prediction on future events. It’s exactly what people who trade stocks have done for years (there’s your appeal to tradition fallacy if you want to make that argument, still doesn’t invalidate the claim I.e. is potentially a fallacy fallacy). There are multiple times throughout bitcoins history that it has taken massive dips only to recover and continue to expand. It’s price is based entirely on people’s faith in it, which can waver when shit happens like all this bitcoin cash nonsense. But the core users remain strong in their investment, the panic passes, more people adopt, and the price goes back up as the faith is restored because the network survived yet another round of “oh shit this is it, it’s the end, better sell”.

Thanks, was hoping at least one out there wouldn’t be like that. Looks like I’m setting up a desktop or paper wallet tonight then.

Exchanges don’t give you access to the keys, when you make a purchase on an exchange they’re just logging that they owe you x amount. No bitcoin actually changes wallets. I would be surprised if exchanges actually buy more bitcoin with each transaction, they probably just have a pool and offer you a Guarantee that if you request it they’ll get together enough bitcoin to send you. Same way a bank would track that they owe you 10 million but wouldn’t actually have 10 million in cash available to give you, just a process to get it to you if requested. Once the supply starts running low I can see this being a significant issue for exchanges. ALWAYS move your money to a private wallet after a purchase. If you don’t control the keys it’s not actually your bitcoin and you’re trusting a corporation not to fuck you which is the opposite of what bitcoin was supposed to accomplish.

I realize that, my questions was do any exchanges actually place your coins in individual addresses that you can view and verify, or do they all keep the coins in there own wallet and track them for you. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:28:03
The trade is confirmed instantly though, even on the best day you can’t get a block confirmation as fast as coinbase confirms your purchase. So while they may eventually buy an equivalent amount from someone else to cover the amount you purchased, they float you the bitcoin in the mean time. Otherwise the transaction wouldn’t instantly be available to move to another wallet like it is. And they never actually tell you who it was purchased from, it just comes from them.

This is what I suspected. Where can I set up a wallet independent of coinbase? Is there anyway to purchase BTC without going through coinbase at all? I’d prefer to avoid as many fees as possible. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:34:12
Well ya, but that’s significantly harder than just telling an exchange I want x amount and buying it. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 20:02:28
I mean I’ve met and work with plenty of people who hold and use bitcoin, I just don’t have any interest in buying it from them when it’s easier and safer to use an exchange as a buffer. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:18:51
Have fun with that when shit goes down and your account gets locked for no good reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:26:47
Really? Would you screenshot the section that explains that? Because I’m not seeing anything on gemini.com about how they use addresses. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 19:55:57
Like paid someone cash in person to send me bitcoin? Not really, confirmation times are too long at the moment and I don’t offer any goods or services I could provide in exchange for bitcoin. That seems way sketchier than using an exchange that at least offers some purchase protection and is plenty safe as long as I immediately transfer it to my ledger. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:00:44
I think that was his implication, it’s pretty hard to acquire bitcoin without using an exchange anymore. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:12:21
Which was the first comments point, use exchanges like PayPal, no one is storing hundreds of thousands in there PayPal account but it’s pretty useful to safely move money from one place to another (I.e. between the sellers wallet and yours).

And I think we saw how well that worked out for them when the January crash came and uninformed new users panicked and sold and lost tons of money. The get rich quick part of bitcoin is done. Unless by quick you mean buying now and holding for 5-10 years.

I’d like to respond to this but honestly I can’t figure out wtf you’re trying to say. That was a hell of a run on sentence. In your very last statement you say liberty is freedom of choice. That’s exactly what bitcoin is. People have another option, many options in fact given all the different coins that have popped up, to store and spend their money. One that they have 100% complete control over, and that can be moved around without needing to go through a bank. You say that things you do will be there forever, but there’s nothing aside from other people’s analysis to tie you to a wallet. The only thing permanently tracked is how much money exists and where it’s being moved to and from. If privacy is concerning you there are plenty of crypto coins, like monero for example, that are based around protecting the users identity. More options, and more control. That’s the liberty crypto offers.

That’s my problem, I just graduated and moved states and have had literally no money left over after paying bills/credit card debt. Wanted to buy in at 2k and couldn’t, I’ve had to keep watching it go up and up all year :( maybe for Christmas I’ll finally buy in, in the mean time im mining ethereum. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 03:20:59
Wonder if they finally found the cold storage address, that would certainly throw a lot of the analysis off.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:28:32
That’s the trade off, let a centralized authority handle it and accept liability, or self regulate and deal with the consequences when you make bad choices.
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:13:20
Frankly I don't feel bad for people when this happens anymore. I've been using bitcoin for like 2 years and this was the very first thing people told me when I started, don't keep your money on an exchange, if you don't control the keys, it's not really your money. At least one post like this pops up a month and the top advice is always the same, don't leave money on an exchange. They're poorly regulated and have a history of fucking people over like this. At this point it's your own damn fault if this happens. Not defending coin bases actions, but this is the inevitable result of leaving money with them. It happens all the time.
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:05:55
Thats not what he's saying, he means when you trade coins that are stored on an exchange they aren't actually moving them between wallets, they're just moving things around in their database to track how much they owe to who. Until you actually request the coins be sent to a wallet you control nothing happens on chain.
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:09:20
Seriously, this has been the rule from day one idk how people are still leaving money on an exchange when hacks are so common. If you don't control the private keys you don't actually control the coins and you're putting your faith in a 3rd party to handle your money for you, in which case you should just use fiat and a classic bank because that defeats the whole purpose of crypto.
