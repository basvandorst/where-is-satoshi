Why do you find the GUI unusable?
If by "masses" you mean anyone who can't wait 3 hours to synchronize the blockchain or understand why synchronizing is necessary, you are probably right. I would argue that the same kind of people would also never run a full Bitcoin (or any coin) node let alone properly securing their private keys and participate in the network. For the masses there are ios, android or webwallets.

Why not go further and just sell the whole division to buy bitcoin from it? That would bring the best return in the long-term, shareholders would love it, probably much better choice than gbtc.

Yes I use it regularly, that is why I asked what exactly makes it unusable in your opinion for the average person. You don't like the UX? Or the ~3 hours waiting for the sync? + my sentence "For the masses there are ios, android or webwallets." was also related to Monero.

speaking of economics, have you ever heard any economists analyzing currencies in that way? Why did not you bring up USD in your example, comparing Paypal shares to USD shares?
Yes you can quantify 'market caps' and even measure how these numbers relate to each other. But when you want to analyze them and draw meaningful conclusions, comparisons like these do not make sense. Good example for a person who fails to understand this is Mark Howards.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:47:41
can we stop comparing valuations of companies with valuations of currencies? I have never seen any post about how paypal relates to the money supply of USD. Because it is not meaningful.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:27:45
This is the Mark Howards way of thinking about it. He asks this question, whether you would like to own all Paypal shares or all Bitcoin... - [source](
This is why people who think similarly fail to understand that they should look at more meaningful things like aggregate transaction value, velocity of money or other currency specific numbers when they try to somehow justify certain price levels. 
There are these maps when you have some very poor countries colored and the sum of all these countries' money supply is smaller than the total bitcoin valuation. I think those comparisons make more sense. That being said, I understand your point, all I am saying is that if we want people to understand the economics behind bitcoin (so they will stop saying 'OMG bitcoin 4k!! so expensive !!!'), these comparisons are not necessarily the best way.
edit: I think I can get sentimental about these things because this is exactly why I avoided btc for a long time and missed out on it. I compared it to companies. Even if it is not entirely meaningless to do so, it can lead to fallacies.

Completely agree. If I blew up 4 months of salary because of a security mistake / panic price drop, what would happen? Nothing. Life goes on, because I have the luxury of not worrying about the money I store in bitcoin. But if I was someone with a crappy job living from month to month, not being able to save a penny, struggling to pay living expenses.. how would bitcoin save my life?

What do you think about second layer solutions like MimbleWimble on top of Monero:
[  
[Tari Labs]( also seems to join the research on this issue.
  
Fungibility is not cheap, especially if it is fungible on the protocol layer. I have never seen a Monero contributor deny this.  


I don't think this is fair to say about the community. In fact I see more off\-chain scaling supporters than big blockers. Even in the core team you can see devs from **both** camps, and guess what, there is no tribalism. Yes, the challenges are definitely bigger, but does that mean "broken scalability"?
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:06:50


slide around 4 mins: It can be a sidechain too. (the tweet I linked says "layer 2 / sidechain")
Please note that I am not denying the asymptotic scaling (I understand why you emphasize it), I am just curious about your personal opinion about sidechains and second layer solutions on Monero. Just like in Bitcoin, those would allow for relatively smaller blocksizes, right? Still, there is a big difference (due to fungibility), but it seems like there are solutions to make it less dramatic in the long term.

EDIT: Pruning just got [merged]( Monero will definitely have it  
Pruning is not technically impossible for cryptonote coins. One of the Monero core devs is experimenting with it on an xmr fork (Aeon), it works quite well, I will just copy one paragraph [from Monero StackExchange](






I don't know when/if the Monero community plans to implement that too, but it is certainly an option.

based on the Caixin report, OTC trading and peer to peer crypto-crypto trading will remain untouched by the government. Regulators will control only the crypto&lt;-&gt;fiat trading activities. So even after shutting down these three money laundering giants, those who will want to trade bitcoin will be able to do so in China. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:08:21
okay but when does the ico start?

@_date: 2017-09-12 22:17:28
Exactly. China starts to shape the regulatory environment in which Bitcoin trading activities can take place. Their problem is not bitcoin trading, but the shady operation of these three giant exchanges. OTC and peer to peer exchanges are untouched (Caixin report). Bitcoin trading will become as usual as stock market speculation, thus similarly regulated there.

ETF is a centralized thing, I can understand the contempt. But, the irony of this is that they will provide liquidity thus make crypto stronger and more resilient. Big players out there badly need an etf as they have no clue how to store billions securely in crypto. Once they have the ability in this centralized etf way, they will ensure the further decentralization of crypto. (Price increase -&gt; more miners -&gt; hash power, stability, more users, etc)

Bitcoin's P/B Price to Book ratio is 175x.
Data sourced from Google (btc price=$5600; an average book costs $32)

They could totally legally continue trading it (fiat to crypto) on over-the-counter markets.
this info is based on the Caixin report, of which we are all freaked out. Bloomberg translated it well too: 
But my opinion is that once this regulatory framework is devised, there will be non-shady exchanges without money laundering purposes, and those will process insane amount of fiat-btc volume. China has no problem with btc trading, this is obvious at this point. They have a big issue only with HOW these trades are currently conducted.

oh shit, I thought I was brilliant, but you are right
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:46:49
I think I misunderstood your point. I was very well aware that these are not new inventions and I agree with that the monero team brought together many existing ideas. But there are sooo many people who still question the validity/added value of these features. You seemed to be one of them. But now I see your point and of course I don't have anything to argue against, sorry for my aggressive tone.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:47:20
Reality = Facts. It is a fact that there are way too many distinct monero specific functionalities to call it "marginal view improvement on a pre existing tech". Have you for example heard of Kovri? Or dynamic blocksize adjustment? Or stealth addresses / ring CT / ring signatures?
It is definitely not "groundbreaking shit" for someone who does not care about fungibility. But for people who need a decentralized anonym payment system to move millions, the details and the facts matter. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:09:02
because you might end up with bitcoins that were previously used for financing terrorism and this might be visible for others, linkable with those previous shady transactions thus no one will accept your coin. With a fungible currency this never happens.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:28:47
Even a small portion of those shorts being liquidated can drive the price up to insane levels. Shorters are losing ~~4%~~ 0.7%  on a daily basis until they close their positions. 
I am looking at the order book  it is just so thin compared to the amount of open shorts (edit: 43k+ currently)

I think he meant market cap, but still easy, you just print 10000 trillion coins and then sell one of them for one satoshi.
