TBH, I don't think Crypto is putting pressure on banks at all.

On to the denial stage of grief are we?
Made some extra prudent investments I take it?
Look, you're totally out to lunch, and what's more, you're a prick about it. That's no sweat off my back though, and you should do you if it makes you happy. Just accept this dumb noise will also make you broke and unpopular at dinner parties hosted by your more successful friends. Ta ta.

Haha what a sad person you are.

The US wouldn't send an FBI agent. Too expensive; too friendly. The Thai police would get you.

Its is among my many good qualities. Alongside being realistic.

Common wisdom is that it is unwise to try to time the market.
But with BTC, that may not hold.

Can you pay more than the IRS?

Fuck, even in the last five things have been nanners.
The author of this article is purely out to lunch.

Lol give me a break. Paying your taxes is not shilling.

BTC is a tiny iota of the total amount of innovation in fintech over the last 25 years. It is very possibly the most disrupted industry going atm.

Banks are nefarious operators whose subtle and ingenious machinations prevent Bitcoin from rightfully taking its place as the cornerstone of the new financial situation. Their infinite resources have allowed them to manipulate markets and spread FUD.
They are also simultaneously incompetent buffoons who employ only fifty year old and over men and women who are mathematically illiterate, financially illiterate, and think code is a fancy word for pig Latin.
Nothing about this is incongruous.

I've also heard that alien abductions are higher in the countryside though. I dunno, seems like a push.

On the contrary, OP, it is tremendous advocacy for mental health. 
The number of people who are heavily invested who also believe we need Bitcoin before the bombs fall, or that the IRS are secretly Lizard People here to harvest organs via the tax system is remarkable.

Right, but then you mention complaining about $0.0004 fees, like a debit or credit card chargers you at POS, and unequivocally not like BTC fees, which are about five orders of magnitude higher.
I was just curious if you were making some point, or whether your idea of what transaction fees are like for BTC was completely disconnected from reality.

They're not opposing it. Nor are they failing to take advantage of it. They're ignoring it because there is no killer use case.
Blockchain is promising, but no one has done anything with it yet except BTC, a few other legitimate cryptos, and rampant fraudulent forks and ICOs.

Is the asterisk "*just pointing this out even though it has nothing to do with the topic".

Given what an obvious lie it is...
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:37:31
I have. I had my documentation in order, they were satisfied, and that was that.

The mild suggestion that you follow the law - the law you knew about when you started speculating, even - is propaganda for this delusional lunatic.
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:00:35
Jesus that was fast. Apparently all you've got to offer is personal attacks and a Reddit addiction.
Been real bruh. Gonna go swim in my money pool while you and the rest of the elite Bitcoin engineers continue to disrupt the world from your startup couch.

Banks employ armies of data scientists and devs you knob.
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:03:16
Anyone who would ask for their salary in BTC is not a smart man.
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:47:30
Done anything useful*.
