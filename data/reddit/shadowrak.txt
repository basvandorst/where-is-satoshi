As long as people pay their capital gains, they really have nothing to worry about.

IMO this is one of the biggest advantages of BTC. ETF denial was because it couldn't be determined who was buying or selling BTC. Here we see that someone is buying in bulk.

This is what my opinion was when I bought at 5k.
I also upped the price on a limit order to the "crash" price 30 seconds before the "crash".

The secret to the wrench attack is not actually knowing your 2FA passwords and only being able to type them properly when you are sober.

Lol you still owe capital gains tax on crypto in the UK even if you aren't paying it. Hope you don't get audited.

Dimon is not so much afraid of bitcoin as he is trying to manipulate the price so he can buy more.
