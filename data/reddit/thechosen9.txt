Near impossible. If it was possible then there wouldn't be such a big price difference in the first place.

Cointelegraph is a sensationalist clickbait site that tries to create hype so they can get traffic from this and other places. 
As long as people blindly keep upvoting them because all their news "is good for Bitcoin" they will keep creating these ridiculous articles. 
Imo they should be blocked from this sub. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 15:48:35
I wonder if you think natural selection means everybody should become as batshit crazy as you. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:37:27
That doesn't work because if they all paid the "right fee" it wouldn't be the right fee anymore. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:57:47
Hmm, is this good for Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-11-30 20:30:52
It can but you'll spend more on electricity. PC mining has been pointless for years already. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 15:38:09
Apart from the fact that their volume is so ridiculously low that it doesn't do anything to the price whatsoever?
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:59:18
You will call anything "tampering with the evidence" when you don't like the outcome of it. Things don't work that way. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:58:11
But these people didn't use Bitcoin so nobody here really cares. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:54:15
Yes, that's correct. The judge used it in her sentence. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:50:18
I hope so. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 22:52:24
Just like the 100 times before where an event was gonna make the price explode this one won't make that happen either. India is not gonna move to Bitcoin. I repeat: India is not gonna move to Bitcoin. 
99.99999% of the people there don't know Bitcoin exists and even if they did they won't suddenly start buying it because gold gets taxed. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 01:50:13
Am i right for thinking every time the mempool is backed up the price goes up and when it's cleared the price goes down again?
I believe i've seen this several times before?
@_date: 2016-12-03 12:41:39
Can you point me out a place in France where one can get 3.7 million dollars for physical gold?
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:57:00
As a defense of the murder for hire shit he called it role playing. The chats, the money sent for the murders was role playing. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 22:27:26
Shall we calculate what got stolen and hacked % wise?
I'm pretty sure things are way worse with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 12:04:53
Yeah, like that will do anything. But i'd love to see them try it. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 15:44:13
I prefer to have the insurance my credit card company gives me and the option to charge back. 
If you get scammed with Bitcoin your money is gone. With a credit card there are several options to get it back. But i'm sure you are aware of that already.

That doesn't answer my question. 
And lets say he eventually ends up with millions in Bitcoin then what? What is this guy gonna do with it?
@_date: 2016-12-05 15:03:20
Crashing up!
@_date: 2016-12-03 23:38:22
If bitcoin goes down 200 dollars tonight because an exchange gets hacked how does that store their wealth exactly?
Bitcoin is extremely unstable and shouldn't be used to store wealth by people who already have massive financial issues. Way too dangerous. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 22:38:14
The bottom of what?
@_date: 2016-12-04 13:28:18
Why do you care so much?
@_date: 2016-12-03 08:47:39
No. Dollars are usable there. 
Again: how would Bitcoin help them? Why don't you answer me instead of calling me names. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 02:19:52
My aunt will never have balls. Bitcoin experiencing another big drop in the future is highly likely. 
But fuck facts and reality, right? Keep on downvoting.

Even more!!! Oh no!


What the fuck are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-11-28 12:01:57
That's about 70 coins a day. I believe India has more than 1 billion citizens?
I'd say this is a dozen or 2 speculators or techies rather than people "fleeing to Bitcoin because of capital controls". 
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:08:22
What did i just tell you?
You fucking did it again. Go read my first post you fucking tool! You're making me cringe so hard!
Fuck me. This is getting totally ridiculous. I'm putting you on ignore.

1: i never ever publish my transaction connected to a forum name. 
2: why the hell would i lie about it? I'm 35 years old. Grow the fuck up. 
3: i don't give a shit if some teenager on some forum doesn't believe me. 
4: you're completely delusional if you think transactions aren't getting stuck.

Yes, get your info somewhere else than a Bitcoin sub where everyone is invested in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:39:37
You're hilarious. 
What makes you think 50 dollars in Bitcoin is better to them than 50 dollars in Paypal?
Stop making a clown of yourself. 
What the fuck are they supposed to do with those bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-12-04 23:13:29
I can't even tell if you're serious anymore.

Every week someone posts this and every week we're somewhere else.

Usually with these kinds of posts, yes. As anybody who's been here longer than a day knows.

Ridiculous argument. Cash is way more usuable than Bitcoin. Even in those countries. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:44:20
I just calculated the volume. 14 coins a day get sold through Localbitcoins. 
200 million people live in Pakistan. 
You call that "very real demand" i call that 0 demand.

Yeah, it's completely ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 15:23:09
So yesterday you're rubbing one out to the fact that the Euro is "crashing" and today you act like it's totally expected that the Euro will become worth more. 
Any idea how desperate you sound right now?
@_date: 2016-12-02 01:51:44
Haha wtf?
@_date: 2016-12-02 01:10:34


No, no and no. Each and every one of those examples wouldn't even cause a tiny bump. It's completely delusional to think this is anything else than a spam attack. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:02:17
Wait, hold on, i got accused of trolling. Can you show me a few troll posts maybe?
Or is that a difficult question to answer?
Because it really seems like i'm not trolling at all and you are simply extremely butthurt that i'm not fully joining the circle jerk. 
And yes, that was my previous nick which i had to leave because a few Bitcoin cultists got really scary and personal. Because i broke a circle jerk or 2. But i'm sure you are disgusted by that kind of behavior. Right?
@_date: 2016-12-03 13:11:19
I'd say you're far from fine as you are batshit crazy. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 14:24:12


Which is such an insignificant amount in a country of 200 million people that it's not even worth posting about. Pretending it's anything else is sticking your head in the sand. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 14:01:30
Apart from the fact of course that it isn't actually happening.

Thank god there are no scammers in Bitcoin land.

People in this sub think complete countries should move to Bitcoin by tomorrow, completely ignoring that 1 big supermarket exclusively using Bitcoin would be enough to cripple the blockchain. 
This and 100 other reasons why it's ridiculous to think Venezuela or any other country can be "saved" by moving to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 01:47:10
Sure: 
Or wait, that's India suddenly moving to Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:45:29
Great advice. So everyone should spend a few more cents and then we have the same problem. Just a more expensive problem. 
What will your suggestion then be? Spend a few more cents?
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:31:09
Because 6 temporary bumps of "mass adoption" is more logical to you?
@_date: 2016-12-05 15:36:53
So we're circle jerking about the fact that "buy Bitcoin" searches are 50% less than they were 4 years ago??
Uhm wow. Just wow.

I love how you pretend as if everyone can just exchange bitcoins for money. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:36:40
Stop acting like investing in Bitcoin can't go wrong. 
Many people invested during the 2013 bubble and lost shitloads of money. Bitcoin is an extremely risky investment. It's more of a gamle than an investment. Stop pretending it's anything else. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 22:12:52
Ah right. I forgot how the Paypal money gets stopped at the border. Silly me. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 02:28:13
Traders trading. 
It's ridiculous these "why is the price dropping" posts every time. Like some people here are truly surprised the price actually can go down. 
No questions asked when it goes up but when it goes down they go "how is this pooossibleee!!!??"

Yup. You live in fantasy land. Poor guy.

@_date: 2016-12-05 14:40:54
You're insane if you think there won't be a better system than Bitcoin in 20 years from now.

Paypal is instant.

Trading = manipulation. People are trying to make money by pumping and dumping. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:40:59
So what you are saying is there will always be people with transactions stuck as it's impossible that everyone pays the correct fee because if they did it wouldn't be the correct fee anymore?
@_date: 2016-12-03 18:28:19
How old are you? Do you have any real world experience at all?
Also why the hell would you move it to Bitcoin first only to be forced to exchange it to cash later?

Occam's razor: Did India mass adopt for a day, just one day or is someone/something spamming the network for one day?
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:34:36
Me too. Been hours now. And that apparently that makes me a sock puppet to some people here. Crazy. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 08:43:59
Here is my strategy: if this place is euphoric (which it is right now) i sell. If this place is desperate (which it will be during the next bear market) i buy. 
I don't consider now a good time to buy. But the thing is nobody on this planet knows what will happen to the price in the next hour or day or week or year. We might go to 1000 tomorrow or to 100. It's a gamble. So first you have to figure out how much money you want to use to gamble. 
Why i am downvoted?
@_date: 2016-12-03 08:38:58
Stop giving new people this kind of advice. You have no idea whatsoever if it's a good time to buy.
Fact is if you were so sure you wouldn't be posting here right not but would be at your bank taking out a 100k loan to buy coins. But you aren't. You simply want this new guy to buy so your coins become worth more and don't give a crap if he loses money on his investment. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 12:11:05
Ok. The OP seems awefully happy about that though. I personally don't like to see others suffer. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 22:54:44
Let me guess. The Euro going down 1 cent is amaaaaaaazing news for Bitcoin as everyone will sell their Euros for the extremely stable currency Bitcoin which never flash crashes insane amounts or goes down at all?
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:16:40
You really have to ask? You really think mass adoption suddenly happened a few hours ago?
What's even more weird is that some people here think this is normal. Eventhough it will drop again in the next 24 hours or so. They will claim India or Venezuela suddenly started using Bitcoin...for a day. Yet those who call it a spam attack are supposed to be the trolls. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 15:49:17
Don't bother. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:47:10
No thanks. I prefer not to throw away my money. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:46:53
I usually don't. There was a specific reason i had to use it now. Bad timing. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 16:38:39
Because a childish sensationalist article tells us so through a clickbait title? 
@_date: 2016-12-02 13:25:42
You're so gonna get scammed. 
Please don't come here crying. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 15:31:15
They're all ponzi schemes. They pay you with someone elses payment. And as with all ponzi schemes some people profit and in the end it implodes. You might get lucky and make a few dollars profit but most likely you simply will lose your money.

How the hell is Bitcoin going to help them?
@_date: 2016-12-02 01:45:49
Nice! I hope we finally can stay above 750. 
But i'm sure some government will ban Bitcoin or a whale is gonna dump 3k coins. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 14:34:28
Well, i certainly hope so. The more the better. I just think it's too soon to make claims like India moving to Bitcoin because of capital controls or whatever. If they were the price would skyrocket. 
The amount of people buying Bitcoin there is just ridiculously small. But if have to believe all these news items here it is exploding. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:43:12
Yet when the Euro goes down half a cent this sub acts as if the world is burning and all the banks are gonna collapse. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 23:02:42
You lost your money but at least you avoided dealing with evil banks!
@_date: 2016-12-02 14:04:40
Well, there might be slight differences depending on where you buy your coins but i'd say the average of Bitstamp and Bitfinex is a good indication. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 21:33:42
50 dollars Paypal is 50 dollars Paypal. It doesn't just magically dissapear when you transfer it. And i'm pretty confident Paypal money is more useful to them than Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:34:32
Can you show me a few posts which you consider trolling?
@_date: 2016-11-30 06:49:59
The Chinese exchanges display fake and inflated numbers. They go up and down by ridiculous amounts all the time. 
Next week or next month they'll suddenly triple overnight again for a new pump. This has been going on for a long time now.

Scam most likely. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 02:33:01
Pretty much at 0. 
I live in a big first world city. I know tons of people. Young and old. I have never met one person who owns or uses Bitcoin. And while most know the term or word Bitcoin, 99% has no clue what it is, where to get it and what to use it for. They just don't care. 
And after 7 years this tells me mainstream adoption is very unlikely to happen. People simply don't care about it. They don't want it. They don't need it. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 08:29:20
Indeed. You have no idea what the fuck you are talking about. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 08:31:40
And what exactly do these bots do according to you?
@_date: 2016-12-03 08:39:34
What facts??
@_date: 2016-12-04 11:33:31
What clearly false assumptions??
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:47:53
3k on a western exchange is enough to cause panic selling and the dump that follows.

If you are going to send them digital money why not simply Paypal dollars for example?
