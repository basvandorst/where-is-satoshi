How should they monetize a fb coin?

Look into Bitcoin Green. It’s not released yet and still in development but it’s selling point is as an environmentally sustainable version of BTC. It won’t be free tho lol

If a miner already has has 100k worth of BTC why would he want to switch coins? often mining rig hardware is coin specific or can only mine a handful of specific coins. BTC mining rigs are not comparable with ETH unless modifications are made to the mining rigs. They would have to buy all new material. They have no reason to switch. Just because an alt coin becomes larger (which one never will in my opinion) does not make the new alt coin more secure.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:40:36
No one is going to switch all coins from the big boy bitcoin. Sure they may spread out their crypto wealth among many shitcoins but after some gains are had profits will be rolled back into BTC not the other way around. Constant pump and dumps over and over again with all the value eventually being converted into BTC/ETH after every dump. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:04:57
lol fuck off with your bitcoin cash nonsense. A bigger block size is a short term solution to a larger problem. Bitcoin cash is fucking trash. I sold mine as soon as I could when it showed up in my coinbase. Every fork people like me will do the same thing... "Hey look, free money! Im going to convert this to BTC!" 
No way people get that sweet free money and just hold it as some shitty alt coin. If you do hold it for any length of time you will find yourself holding the bag. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:06:58
Who will move all their BTC to some shitcoin en masse? No one is dumb enough to cash out all of their BTC for something valued tremendously less

It has been confirmed, the Rothschild Fam is onboard the BTC train. Cho cho mother fucker 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:13:56
Rothschild fam will buy BTC too if they are smart. At some point they will buy the coin as insurance against their vast fortune
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:57:41
buy and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:39:50
As the price continues to go up everyone in the world is trying to buy themselves a lottery ticket in case BTC really does continue to increase in value

Censorship is about silencing specific opinions over others. It doesn’t matter if it is the government or a privet company that does the censoring, it is still censorship.

It’s not about the right to do or say something, it’s the definition of censorship regardless of right or wrong

I would think of it as a temporary solution that ensures security. As bitcoin evolves so will the methods of storing it. Right now it is the wild west so people need to take precautions. By the time BTC is used for everyday transaction someone will have invented a more effective method of portable storage out of necessity.

45 years since it was taken off of the gold standard. That was when it became fiat 
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:56:43
Fiat currencies last 30-40 years. The USD is going on 45 years now 
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:12:51
A very impressive feat for the pound to last so long. I believe it is the longest lasting fiat currency in history.  It also has been in decline since it became fiat. I would look to sterling’s decline to forecast the eventual decline of the USD. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:38:00
I filled it out for you 
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:57:09
Could be both 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:15:20
The entire process was from 1971-1973, it was called the Nixon Shock. 
I am simply measuring from the final year of the transition. The amount of time we have been on fiat is nothing to argue over when both calculations are so similar, 45 years or 47 years doesn’t matter both are many years past the average lifespan of fiat currency. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 03:57:11
No one knows why Satoshi Nakamoto chose 21 million 
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:00:00
End state is deflationary. Once all coins are mined coins can only be lost. 
If inflation is predetermined by mathematics does that mean that inflation is already baked into the value? Fiat currency inflation is determined by a central authority and is subject to change. Bitcoins is determined by the math behind the protocol, and end state of bitcoin is deflationary. 
So it’s both, depending on your perspective.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:53:18
BTC will reach 100k in 2019. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:02:18
and after that dollars will begin to become irreverent. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:43:50
If 21 million bitcoin are divided up by 7.5 billion people, that’s about .003 BTC per person. 
That’s my perspective on his comment

it is definitely *probable*

HODL is about not panic selling. It has nothing to do with buying. Though you are right, people should be buying up these cheap coins. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:54:35
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:18:38
When the market reacts irrationally and has massive swings people naturally freak out. The meme was born during a time like now when the market was crashing. The idea is if the core group of bitcoiners do not panic sell then 
A. They won’t lose money by being a bad trader 
B. The market will eventually go back up 
Of course most people who are HODLing will also begin buying coins for cheap to stop the slide and buy the bottom of the market.

But if bitcoin is the single world currency than there is no reason to sell and simply having it gold style would make us kings in the same way ancient kings were wealthy because they had had gold in their vaults 
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:43:15
how much BTC must we amass to become kings in this future of your’s? I would also like power over the sheeple of the world 
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:53:11
If we buy bitcoin now for cheap than we get the gold without needing the power or production. Once we have the gold we can build our kingdoms however we want. Who ever had the gold has the power, not the other way around. Sure if you have existing power you can use that power to get more gold but if you already have power than I’m betting you already have wealth as well. 
Kings often didn’t have any type of production other than owning the land that was farmed by their peasants. Although I see what you are saying I don’t think we can apply the modern take on production economies to dark age kingdoms that had very little production at all besides food. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:56:06
you are thinking of mercantilism not capitalism. Mercantilism was the leading economic philosophy before capitalism.

Edit: time for us all to sell 
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:59:24
The problem is no one will want to trade their bitcoin for this inflationary currency. Why would someone trade their BTC for something that constantly loses value? sure a few people may switch, but the majority of people will think it is a ploy for others to steal THEIR precious bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:21:12
I think it is better to do a few at a time. It will be much easier to fix bugs in their systems with only a few states having access instead of all 50 yelling at once that it is broken. 
We don’t want it to end up like coinbase where they lock peoples accounts and the whole app ends up getting fucked like when they added Bitcoin Cash out of no where.

Satoshi has 1 million bitcoins in his account. That’s 8.33% of all bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:01:23
Satoshi wanted his vision for bitcoin to succeed. I theorize that he left those million bitcoin in his wallet to prove they could not be hacked. People don't need to worry about the security of their bitcoins until satoshi's million coin stash is stolen. 
What kind of hacker is going to go after someone with 10 BTC when they know there is a wallet out there with 1,000,000 BTC in it ? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:42:31
Even if the market tanked don’t you think 1 million bitcoin would still be worth a fortune?

Doesn’t matter how much it is worth now if your mortgage is fixed at a specific rate. The mortgage payments do not increase as the currency inflates. 
Real estate is considered to be a hedge against inflation for this reason.

In countries with unstable currencies mortgage rates are not fixed. Mortgages in Venezuela have different rules so that banks can protect themselves from financial catastrophes like we are witnessing.

@_date: 2019-05-01 20:46:47
If your mortgage is fixed at pre inflationary value, yes. 
Example: House purchased for 300k. Hyper inflation takes things out of control and now there are million dollar notes in circulation. Pick one up off the street and walk to the bank and you could pay down the whole mortgage in full.
