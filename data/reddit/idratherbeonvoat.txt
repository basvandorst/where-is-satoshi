Clearly the highly technical solution is working great, only 227,000 unconfirmed transactions and ridiculous transaction fees. Seems like the simpler solution would have been better here.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:44:36
If only there was some kind of simple technical solution to this whole scaling issue. 
Oh yeah, there is, and CORE/Blockstream refused to implement it in favor of a completely untested solution, which is why all of you are paying $15-30 transaction fees.

Why don't we just show votes and let the community decide? This has worked well so far, unless your goal is to suppress a particular narrative, in that case carry on. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:31:27
If you have to fudge the order that posts appear in, make it so comments aren't automatically hidden, even going so far as to alter the CSS - you're probably on the wrong side of history.

It's good to see the mods are working overtime this holiday season. This wasn't even up an hour! 
Go take a break, you've earned it!

Obviously, but this company is stupidly risking their reputation. I definitely will not be using their services after reading this.

Bitcoin is a platform, just about anything can be built on top of it. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 20:01:58
Apologies, I misread the original question. I thought you were just being an ass and saying a hard fork had never been done successfully. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 03:35:38
How productive. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:10:53
He is in a position of power within the bitcoin community, considering recent events it's not much to ask if there is some kind of conflict of interest here. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 23:06:11
It depends on the thread, this is set to best right now, but at any time the default can be switched to controversial. There is only one reason to do this - to manipulate. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:27:32
Haha, by the looks of things you hit the nail on the head. I think he ran away. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:22:13
If I want to sort controversial, I will and would suggest everyone do the same if that's what they would like to do as well. 
Steering the conversation by choosing the sort? That's getting pretty close to censorship. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 21:41:59
You say brigade, I say community opinion. 
If you're so sure you're being brigaded - why don't you bring it to the attention of the reddit admins? I assume if you feel this way you have some kind of proof, just send it on over to them and I'm sure they'll listen. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:09:06
Considering his position of power it's not unethical in the slightest. 
Also - what makes you think everyone here values anonymity? Just curious. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:25:23
I guess nobody should pay any attention to you then. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:20:08
The only thing you can do is vote with your wallet.

The Blockchain is a platform. 
Is that better?
@_date: 2015-12-09 23:15:30
Interesting, sounds like a decent way to spread your coins around physically without compromising security. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:26:38
No reputation =/= clean reputation. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 23:42:55
I don't think people can actually see everyone's opinion. This thread is a great example - it automatically sorts by Controversial, now why is that? This is the only post currently on the front page that automatically sorts this way. To verify, I checked on another computer using IE (which never gets used), again this is the only post that sorts this way. 
So, what purpose would this serve to combat spamming and brigading? Obviously someone has to manually set this, if you're around to do that, couldn't you just moderate as normal?
What purpose could this actually serve other than to control what appears at the top? Everybody assumes they're sorted by best - so effectively you've taken control of the narrative by tricking people. Regardless of impropriety, the appearance of impropriety is just as bad, and this place stinks real bad. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:28:17
Why does wanting privacy automatically equal dishonesty?
@_date: 2015-12-09 22:41:25
So someone else has possession of your coins? Sounds even less secure.

What happens when you don't have the required bandwidth to transmit ~8MB in 30 seconds?
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:43:42
Haha, at least you're honest. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 04:29:01
I think that's the point. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:41:24
Sounds like someone didn't actually read the article.. then again based on your post history you're likely just a troll anyway. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 14:57:23
Enlighten us, then. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 15:30:47
At the end of the day they're the ones making the investment in the network, changes to the network will have an outsize effect on them and their business compared to average users. That's not to say we should take what they say as gospel, however something as simple as a block size increase shouldn't be getting this much push back from core, unless their goal is to move Bitcoin into a settlement system. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 04:47:55
I was hoping you knew something I didn't. Apparently I was wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:32:01
They're just using blockchain tech, just like every other altcoin out there. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:26:53
Sounds like I'm never using LBC. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:29:07
I'd say if you're an expert in encryption you don't have much to worry about, unfortunately for the rest of us that's not the case. You can only control a mechanism you properly understand. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:04:56
I'm pretty sure that's exactly what the NSA is doing. 
Look at the payment they made to RSA.. just have to weaken the right RNG. 
However, I think they've got endpoints on lock down so it probably doesn't matter anyway.

Paypal goes down for two hours and there is a shitstorm, it's pretty obvious the same could be said of Bitcoin. Though I would agree, it would definitely be driven by special interests. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:17:48
Care to elaborate? As I recall the primary concern was related to storage and bandwidth, which are both becoming exponentially cheaper. Why wouldn't increasing the block-size facilitate an increase in maximum transactions per second?
@_date: 2015-11-04 00:50:19
What other bottlenecks are slowing TPS if not the hard limit of block sizes?
