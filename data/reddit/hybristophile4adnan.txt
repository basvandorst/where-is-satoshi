He uses the word 'expert' 8 times. I am in two minds. I think why would the real SN be out there selling himself on something as degrading as Linkedin? This guy is clearly a self promoter - the opposite of SN. BUT on the other hand I think - hold your horses. Everyone wants SN to be some pure being. Maybe everyone has just built up a mythical ideal of what SN should be like. Maybe that is Craig's whole point. He needs someone 'better than him' to sell the product. Maybe people need to stop idealising SN like some mythical god.
What strikes me about his Linked in profile is this


It is just plonked there without explanation. I mean he talks about cyber security. WTF is a computer geek doing managing a $5b trust? This doesnt add up. 
Also if he did do that online casino job - then that was in 1999 - so this guy has been in the game a long time.
I think people are being too quick to call this a hoax.

Sounds like this 'personality' issue is your main concern. What makes sense is he was hiding his identity because creditors and the tax office were on his tail. Now that he has left Australia is he cares less about secrecy.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:30:32
His linked in is completely ridiculous. He just says:


Err what?  the he says 'Associate of Science'. WTF are these things? they are just words. They are not qualifications or course of any kind.
And the tuxedo is weird. He is from Queensland - which is notorious for con men.
But heck - maybe he really is just a weird dude. Just because he isnt what people 'expect' doesnt mean he didnt do it. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:32:18
But Craig White isnt trying to out himself. So why would he do something to out himself?

It it is hilarious how people expect Satoshi to be some wise guru idealistic genius saint that they can look up to.
Most likely Wright knew he couldnt sell Bitcoin so created a personality that could. Satoshi was most likely Kleiman's work. Satoshi is a PR stunt - not a real person.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:27:45
One letter different hardly adds up to 'complete horseshit' does it now. You are in denial and exaggerating your claims.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:56:43
Why? Because he is American and you think Umericans own the internet.
Thats the main reason reddit is imploding over this folks. American arrogance. They simply cannot handle the fact the dude who invented Bitcoin isnt American. And now they are clutching st straws and drowning in a sea of denial.
@_date: 2015-12-10 19:07:47
He did leave. He shifted to the UK and Iceland. He claims he went to Iceland for the 'cheap power' but I suspect it is also because they have a low corporate tax rate (20%) and low capital gains tax (20%). This means that capital gains he makes on his bitcoin will be taxed at a much lower rate than in Australia. Iceland do have very cheap electricity though. So this is true.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:16:10
Because he turned mined bitcoin into cold harsh fiat cash all tax free.
Until someone figured out the scam.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:09:19
It isn't top shelf but it definitely isnt bought either. I'd say it was inconclusive.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:59:34
He hasnt tried to out himself.  Others are outing him. So your whole premise is flawed.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:52:49
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:03:59
Snake oil + bitcoin = a match
And it is don 'quixotic'.
But hey you are the guy on reddit telling everyone how smart you are and judging everyone's qualifications.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:09:13
How is it a lie when he isnt outing himself?
Others have outed him. Why would he use the key when he isnt admitting it? Hes not to trying to prove shit.
So the cryto nerds must be fucking retarded if that is their logic.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:40:47
I think you are close to the mark. His main reason for secrecy was probably because he owed creditors from previously failed businesses and the ATO money. If these people find out he has a stash of bitcoin - they go after his money. This is why he was using highly paid lawyers from Clayton Utz. It seems like he was hiding behind lawyers and was able to pay for expensive ones. Wright also knows if people know he is behind Bitcoin - then it will take the shine off the product, the allure and mystique. He knows he will hurt the brand.
I think many on here are desperately wanting this to be a hoax for two big reasons:
 1) He isnt American and the reddit community cannot handle that because they like to think Umerica owns the internet. Brains explode.
 2) He isnt the idealised puritan genius everyone expected. People were hoping for some kind of ascetic/libertarian philosopher king they could put on a pedestal like an anti-establishment cypher guru or something. This had turned into a quasi religious experience for some.

The increase in value from 2009 to now - which is a shitload.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:07:43
You are projecting dude. You want Satoshi to be you.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:25:43


But he hasnt tried to claim he is Satoshi so your entire premise is false. He has been outed by third parties and has attempted to deny it and cover up. He has avoided calls and not responded to emails.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:06:54
Nick Szabo seems like an asshole who would have loved to have invented Bitcoin and be famous.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:32:26
No the reddit readers expect him to be a completely orthodox conventional thinker who copies what they think. Yet still somehow invent Bitcoin and also be be morally perfect. An anti-establishment guru.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:50:17
Boom. There you go. It is him. You can bet on it.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:32:42
@_date: 2015-12-10 19:37:11
That's true.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:48:08
Which makes him fit right into Bitcoin. What are you expecting? Some perfectly moral puritan? I think people have fantasised what SN is.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:00:52
Crap. He is exactly the type who would want to hide. A libertarian who doesnt like paying his taxes and hates the government. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 19:25:59
Yes and Wright was threatening to leave Australia and go to Singapore.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:58:02
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:58:04
Racist crap. You cant handle that the guy who invented Bitcoin isnt American so now you are trying to make out like an American did it and he was some great guy as well. What a crock of shit.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:35:02
We know for a fact Wright was mining Bitcoin as early as 2009.
We also know he was paying for very expensive lawyers.
We also know he had set up elaborate dealings with multiple companies in multiple countries very early in the life of Bitcoin.
Obsession with avoiding the tax authorities is an extremely good motivator to want to stay anonymous.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:04:52
Exactly. People are projecting their own ideology (I dont like banks. I am anti-establishment) and claiming they 'know' the true nature or intentions of Satoshi. It is ridiculous. It is simply idealism. They have an 'ideal' of what Satoshi should be. When he turns out to be just a regular slightly shady dude - their heads explode. It ruins the dream of the revolution where the bitcoin community takes over the world and creates some cyber-utopia where they all get laid twice a week.
@_date: 2015-12-10 19:08:12
@_date: 2015-12-10 19:00:39
The way I read it is Kleiman died in 2013 and 15 months after that - the Trust with all the bitcoin was to be transferred back to Dr Wright - hence the stoush with the tax office.
And there is an Auditor who works at the ATO called Adam Westwood.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:21:02
Why? He isnt claiming to be SN. He isnt outing himself.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:31:34
So the inventor of Bitcoin doesnt just follow convention? Wow there is a surprise. No shit.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:44:51
Maybe Greg Maxwell has his head shoved too far up his own ass?
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:53:17
He also says this


A clear error. Whereas lots of redditors have been claiming SN has a perfect control of English blah blah blah. What a load of crap. People have simply fantasised about what they want Satoshi to be.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:46:03
The Aussie govt are in his house but has already re-located to UK/Iceland.
Ill bet that house isnt even in his name.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:54:21
Satoshi says this for example


@_date: 2015-12-10 19:16:57
Wright is more than an 'early miner.'
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:42:54
Iceland has cheap power and low taxes.
