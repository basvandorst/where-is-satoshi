I was thinking about this too, I guess merchants will have to wait for more than zero confirmations on big purchases then, I honestly don't see any one using this to undo a coffee purchase

Come on now, lets say he indeed wrote the paper, that doesn't mean he is Satoshi Nakamoto..  He probably assisted on or whatever and thats only if this research is true and I highly doubt it

Still waiting for my invite too and not just me but lots of family members I got into "the easy way to buy and sell bitcoins" slogan..  I'm very disappointed

Same mistake I did, I was really aware of bitcoin since pretty much two or three months after it went public then I spent years thinking about buying or mining worse yet when the price was at 10 dollars I didn't buy in, worse mistake ever, I entered bitcoin at 144...then sold and re-entered at 300+ fml

What if you trade Bitcoins for mazacoins, do you still have to pay taxes? Are mazacoins include in "virtual currency" by the government of US.. Hmm

You guys seem to be taking this too serious Its dogecoin we talking about here, 1 doge = 1 doge is part of the joke, its a way to just forget about the price in dollars and use the coin as a currency, its like a slogan too of course they want in the future to pay with only doges so its a goal, like "to the moon"..

I know, its very confusing but here it is
hopefully they can improve the UI too

There is 2fa support but you have to enable it in their main site

perhaps a sidechain is the answer to this? one that can confirm the transaction faster than bitcoin does

Lol the titles are always awesome despite being butt-hurt

I like uBits, mBits etc, its kinda the best from both, that way you have SI prefixes and bitcoin slang "bits" together

TouchID was done in the Atrix, by that same company Apple bought before they "innovated"

Definitely hand them some bitcoin and if you can you should demostrate how a transaction works
And if you need another example of how beneficial bitcoins are talk about people sending money back home from all over the world, in US the cost to send money to México is about $10-$20 or BTC 0.02-0.04 versus the BTC 0.0001
