This is what I got from the Korean translations from the video.
Q: What impact will the hard fork in November have on the Bitcoin industry?
A: The hard fork will take place in November, and if there is disagreement, then there will be two coins, just like ETH and ETHC. However, but logically speaking, if we look at those who support segwit2x, first are those who mine. 90% of them approve of segwit2x, and over 70% of users of bitcoin approve of segwit2x. With this in mind, even if the hard fork activates in November, then it seems as though they will follow this chain and create a blockchain, it seems like most people would agree with that chain.
Q: What is Bitmain and Antpool doing to prepare for the hard fork?
A: In preparation for the hard fork, Bitmain and Antpool are supporting the points of the New York Agreement and are supporting the use of BTC1 (btc1 = supporters of segwit2x)
Q: What are the pros and cons of hard fork and why are people against the hard fork? What problems are there with the hard fork?
A: What are the postives of the hard fork? The block size increases from 1mb to 2mb. When transactions occur, the transaction fees become lower. Also, many more users can be exposed to bitcoin and possess bitcoin. The flaws are businesses must conduct hardware and software updates because of the hard fork. All businesses must come to an agreement in order for the hard fork to take place successfully. Currently, some companies support hard fork while some don’t. Those who support the hard fork are the real supporters of bitcoin, those who love bitcoin and want bitcoin’s greater success. Even in China, there are many altcoin companies, and they are against the hard fork. Finally, those who have an idealistic view of bitcoin oppose the hard fork.
Q: As we just heard, those who make altcoins are against the hard fork. If you study this more carefully, you will see how altcoins will survive and compete against bitcoin. Next question: Segwit was mentioned at around January, and I will ask why we didn’t accept Segwit but activated Segwit2x.
A: he talked about the difference between Segwit and Segwit2x. If we did Segwit and not Segwit2x, then all transactions would shift to the sidechain, and this goes against bitcoin’s purpose of decentralization. 
Q: We talked about Segwit and Segwit2x. Another important point is BCC. As we just heard, the difference between Segwit and Segwit2x is are we going to expand the blockchain. That is the core issue, and Segwit2x resolves this issue. Now we will ask him about BCC.
A: Originally, UAHF is a measure to prepare for UASF. This measure was released in April by Bitmain, and it headed in the direction of Segwit2x, the soft fork. However, some people proceeded with the hard fork, which Bitmain had carried out. Therefore, although Bitmain had suggested the hard fork, it wasn’t Bitmain that carried it out. Thus the biggest issue is did Jihan Wu control BCC, but the truth is someone else is doing that, not Mr. Wu. ViaBTC is now in charge of it. Currently, ViaBTC and Bitmain share an investor/investee relationship. Bitmain does not take part in operations.
