Not always, i am currently on hashflare which is a domain of hashcoins enterprise that works with blockchain technologies and mining hardware since 2013.
"Don't do it, is risky" said the one who trusted once and never researched about how cloud mining works.
I am not saying you are going to become rich AF, but with the money you have, the possible income is huge, because in BTC mining, the one with the biggest machine takes the biggest part.

You can start with $1.2, i invested $12 to make sure it works and you can withdraw or reinvest depending on what you want.
It is not a miracle, you need patience, to look at how it grows.
P.D: research, take your time.

Yes, research.
 
If you pay your hashrate for example with BTC, you can withdraw your funds each 24hr if you want it or you can reinvest it.
If you pay with Credit Card, (which is the only method that retains funds for 2 weeks for security) you can start withdrawing after those weeks.
There are other methods to pay such as:
EMC (no idea what is this)
Wire transfer
Credit card
Also you can mine Dash, ETH, and other one, prices and terms of the contract may vary depending on the coin you are going to operate with.
For example:
BTC: the contract is unlimited but a fee is discounted for usage and electricity.
ETH: the contracts goes for a year (365 days) but no fees are taken from you.

I am all about BTC &amp; ETH.
But that goes on you.

What if you invest a little fraction on cloud Mining?

Said the who didn't researched before.
