It's an inherent problem with password based logins though, you can always end up submitting your password to a fake site or a breached site, which, if you use the same passwords everywhere, becomes even worse. 
2FA helps in securing your account, but it does not help in discerning whether the web is fake or real. Wondering if there is a solution to this..

careful about the fake software wallets that have been popping up on the App Store though...

I'd recommend Trezor, since it's the first hardware wallet and has a longstanding reputation regarding its security. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:29:30
Trolling much?
@_date: 2017-01-09 10:42:01
Dude, that's quite irrelevant at this point. Packages can be broken into.
What's more relevant is if you complained to the postman when he gave the package to you. Why would you accept an empty package anyway?

There was a tweet about your sales numbers, was this also the attacker? If so, did he get access to confidential data, such as shipping addresses of customers?
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:00:59
This is confusing. you mean the trezor was stolen from the package?
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:39:36
I see what you did there....
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:23:45
If it has been stolen during shipping, shouldn't you complain to your post instead of them?
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:15:13
r\btc is not very happy about the poll
@_date: 2016-11-25 11:04:30
Right, but new cellphones sport batteries with 6 times the capacity of Blue, so I'd think this was a legitimate question.
@_date: 2016-12-06 08:12:50
No one knows where bitcoin is going, one can only hope. But definitely, get a hardware wallet to protect your money. Trezor is still a very good choice, even if there are other alternatives. They've been on the market for very long, earning the trust of the community.

There should be a way to turn off SMS as channel of delivery. Then it would make more sense
@_date: 2016-12-13 13:45:12
Good. At least that will somewhat decrease the threat of BadUSB.
Yes, but an actively traded USB device has a much larger attack vector. If you buy an USB device for yourself, someone needs to carefully replace that exact one. If you specifically trade USB devices, the possibility of an attack is widened.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:45:01
Well, but then, shouldn't you complain to the post service? Like, when they delivered it to you...
It is them, after all, who do the shipping.

Thieves will more likely go for this because it looks like a phone/mini-tablet
(Proving your point)
EDIT: removed question 
@_date: 2016-11-25 10:47:34
How much does it weigh? What's the battery screen-on time?
Wouldn't the requirement to keep the battery charged actually impede on usability? I know I hate my phone's battery life and I can't see how 500mAh would be enough to keep Blue alive for the whole day.

I think both the TREZOR and Ledgers have measures against changed fw. Trezor displays a warning if the fw isn't signed with correct keys
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:30:36
I hope you know whom are you calling a moron...
@_date: 2017-04-30 13:34:37
KeepKey has arguably the slowest development, as they take their FW code from TREZOR and focus primarily on marketing. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:59:03
Wow. Cocky.
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:51:35
This kinda applies to all security devices.. as we have seen from KRACK or Infineon RSA libraries lately.

Just because a terrorist attack did not happen in Prague yet does not mean that Prague is actively doing something to prevent terrorism. There is no causal link between these two things.
In fact, Prague does not have good protection against attacks like those in Paris, Barcelona, London, etc. Our streets are open, there are no physical barriers between a pedestrian zone and the main roads. Tourists at the Castle stand in long lines next to the main street, making them a perfect target.
And claiming that closed borders prevent terrorism is laughable. Nothing can prevent terrorism, that's why it's "terror".
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:01:35
Thank you for being so transparent about this. 
Could this be considered as a quite serious breach, for some? 
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:45:53
Cuz, ya know, high fees and long confirmation times totally help bitcoin wallets, eh... /s
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:16:17
This affects Ledger too. Try harder.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:14:13
Keepkey = trazor code doe.
@_date: 2017-05-09 10:55:07
Buy both and spread out your portfolio. Don't keep all the eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2017-05-02 09:13:17
You mean the "Dublin Agreement" and not Schengen.
But this is all very OT

What's the point of trusting a reseller, instead of the manufacturer? I'm curious. Just because it's sold on Amazon, it does not mean that the reseller is using NSA-grade protection.
Moreover, if you think that these companies cannot protect their customer data, why would you trust the devices in the first place (irrespective of who sells them)?
Maybe do your research about the hardware wallets before you call the companies "garage companies"?
Euro is a world currency, both companies are based in Europe, which probably means they do their accounting in EUR. Why would they need to create another accounting overhead by listing prices in USD?
Both Ledger and TREZOR are reputable companies in the Bitcoin community. Google them and you will get a their entire track record. TREZOR came first and offers a completely open source device, ledger uses secure element. The developers are active members of the community and have created several standards for Bitcoin.

My Trezor works fine on Mint (should be good for Ubuntu too)
@_date: 2016-07-26 09:03:14
Instead of complaining online, you know you can petition the European Parliament, which has to eventually vote on this right?

Hw wallets are way safer than paper wallets
