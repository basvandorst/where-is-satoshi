What's stopping Facebook from using their 'Global Coin' in the same way that Binance is using BNB? Global Coin could be the stable coin that powers the 'Facebook CryptoExchange'. Global Coin might also be used to get in on security offerings via the 'Facebook Launchpad'. Given the sheer numbers of users, Global Coin could become the most well-used stable coin on the world's largest crypto-exchange and on the richest 'Launchpad'. And, in those ways, couldn't it then appreciate in value and become a hot new speculative coin?
