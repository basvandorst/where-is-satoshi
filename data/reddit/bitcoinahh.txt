What's the problem? I've had a trezor for a while. When I bought it, it came with a short USB cable and a long USB cable. For the longest time I used the short USB cable but then after some time it stopped working and I thought my trezor was broken as it would not connect/turn on. Turns out it was the cord. Switched to the longer USB cord and now it works just fine again. Hope this helps.

If you have a smart phone, download the "airbitz" app and use their directory to find locations near you that accept BTC

It's not a pyramid scheme lmfao.
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:22:13
Not having to deal with third parties when transacting with one another, being your own bank, and quick and cheap transactions. (I use bitcoin for business purposes on a daily basis sending $1000+ per transaction across the world so it works perfectly for me)
@_date: 2017-01-12 12:56:08
They sell high in large quantities, cause panic, and start buying back at a lower price when capitulation hits. The end result: they end up with more bitcoins than they had before. Happens every time. Name of the game is to increase your bitcoin holdings. The sooner you realize that the better off
You will be :)
Also there are many buyers, the problem is everyone is scared to buy at this moment in time. A lot of them are waiting on the sidelines. Give it time
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:24:33

Do not chase other coins because you think you missed the bitcoin boat. This is the worst thing you can do imo. Many people have gotten burned "hoping for the next bitcoin" over the years.

I see where you are coming from but at the same time you are being quite hostile in my opinion. Just because bitcoiners consider this "good news" doesn't mean they are slaves to greed like you say. 
It's more of a "I saw this coming ages ago, and since it's going to happen and there's nothing any of us can really do about it, we may as well benefit by our bitcoins going up in value." 
I really don't see anything wrong with that. Chill out lol
@_date: 2017-04-19 16:15:37
Because it works just fine and there's nothing better. It has proven itself for 8 years and is the more secure blockchain by far.

Umm try the exact opposite? Maybe you thought you were posting in "that other sub" where segwit is being boycotted? Bitcoiners should want to SUPPORT seg wit. Litecoin is a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:13:27
He did say "diversify to ltc rather than to any other alt " I assume specifically for seg wit 
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:16:38
I agree. I think it's really cool that ltc has decided to embrace seg wit. No doubt the price will rise significantly if it goes through. My hopes are that the bitcoin community will see this and it will help everyone (or whoever is still unsure)realize that seg wit is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-05 10:42:13
Great question! I noticed that people in the crypto space tend to use these two terms interchangibly when in reality they have two very different meanings. 
An example of digital currency/crypto currency is bitcoin... If you hold your private keys, you are the owner of said bitcoins. 
Virtual currencies consist of coins/currencies within a virtual world or virtual game such as World of Warcraft, Maplestory, Runescape, and many other online games. These virtual currencies all have fluctuating value just like any market, as there are always buyers and sellers (supply and demand).
Although these virtual coins/currencies are sold and bought on a regular basis, the difference is that you never actually own any of these currencies. It is stated in the Terms of Service of these games that anything within the game is the property of the game creator and does not belong to you in any way, shape, or form. So although you are able to sell and buy the virtual currencies which many people tend to do, most game creators don't approve of this and if they catch you doing so they have every right to confiscate the virtual currency. 
Hope this provided a clear explanation!
@_date: 2017-04-23 18:05:53
Haha nope it's cool I'm sure I'll run into him eventually 
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:00:56
I would rather it be litecoin than eth. Eths purpose is to be gas for smart contracts. Ltc would be much better coffee currency.
And then ofc btc would still be for larger transactions since it's the most secure.
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:37:05
There is a way you can lock funds until a specific date, I'm not exactly sure how to do it though. Someone on here will know

Where is this guy? I haven't seen him yet and I'm pretty far into the game. I guess I need to explore some more ��
@_date: 2017-04-14 17:09:01
Jesus... those interest rates are such scams. Just hearing about them reminds me how much I despise banks/credit card companies and why I bought bitcoin in the first place. 
Good luck. Idk if using a loan to buy btc is smart, but I definitely recommend that you hold some btc over the next few years.

Considering the Chinese exchanges have now caught up to western exchanges, probably not at all. Originally I thought price would drop because the Chinese would be taking advantage of the arbitrage opportunity due to the -$200-400 premium in china, but that's no longer the case

90% btc 10% eth which I plan to convert back for more btc soon. Eth is way riskier.. I'm not going to hold the majority of my crypto wealth in a coin less than 2 years old. Maybe in 5 years if it's still in second place and running smoothly.

Run a node supporting SW/uasf
Contact the miners and exchanges via twitter to support segwit and uasf.
Buy a little bit of litecoin ? To support segwit (through price incentive)
These are what I have done to help at least.
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:45:21
After eth has had like 1000% increase in 2 months? How can you suggest that to someone lol. 
Buy btc, wait on eth.
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:48:02
Yes. Your buy price is locked in as soon as you submit your buy order

Considering btc is the more secure of the two, you should have majority in btc. When eth price was low I had 75% btc 25% eth. Now that the eth price is ridiculously overpriced I have switched back to 90% btc 10% eth.
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:07:11
Apart from being a store of value (like gold) that you can actually transact with, another important aspect is that you are in control of your own money. When your money is in a bank it can be taken from you/frozen at any time. Anything can happen and one day in just the blink of an eye, you could be like one of those people in Greece only able to withdraw 50 euros a day from the bank.

@_date: 2017-07-18 08:47:47
"Has tons of projects going" been hearing that for a year now. Still waiting...
Also the advertising is wrong because ethereum is not meant to compete with bitcoin. Ethereum is like digital oil and bitcoin is like transferable digital gold. A direct competitor to bitcoin would be litecoin or dash, and a competitor to ethereum would be tezos. Please get your facts straight.

You don't know what you're talking about. Eth has an unlimited amount of tokens. Btc ha a 21m cap so naturally they will be worth more. They are also meant to do different things. It sounds like you're one of those guys that Thinks he's smart and is buying "the next bitcoin"

Most coins are guilty until proven innocent. Bitcoin has proven itself for 8 years. Nobody is going to risk parking millions of dollars in a new coin that's been around For a short period of time that could easily have a bug and crash hundreds of percent overnight 
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:06:26
This was most likely because your balance was in alt coins which were also dropping simultaneously. This means your liquidation price is actually a lot closer than it appears to be. Bad luck. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:28:30
I don't understand why people compare now to 2013... in 2013 bitcoin went up 1000% in 1 month. In 2017 bitcoin has gone up 200% in 2 months. 
Very different situations 
@_date: 2017-07-10 10:52:42
It's a good thing (for bitcoin users) because the way the federal reserve currently operates (inflation/printing unlimited money) is a flat out scam. Bitcoin is a way out and it's why btc will continue to appreciate in value for years to come. It's simple really. And it's not just a joke.. have you ever compared the color of the 1s, 5s, 10s, 20s, 50s and 100s in Monopoly money to the current colors of the USD bills? They are the exact same colors. The jokes on you buddy! And the majority of the US population that doesn't know any better unfortunately..and it has been for many, many years.
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:14:35

The reason many of us choose to stick with bitcoin (other than its security) is because its immutable and has a cap of 21m coins. The same cannot be said for ethereum..
That's not going to change unless bitcoin has some groundbreaking flaw
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:28:08
This has been a good method the past 2 months. However the alt coin bubble will not continue forever so I will say this is horrible advice. Stick with bitcoin OP

@_date: 2017-06-08 11:26:14
If you have your coins stored in an offline wallet, then just hold them and wait until the dust settles. This way you have nothing to worry about as you will have coins on both chains. Hopefully UASF is successful and we can finally have segwit + lightning network !

This is amazing. 
 
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:18:07
first of all you make it very clear you have a negative bias towards bitcoin at the moment. I assume that's it comes from a lack of understanding.
It's not anonymous but it's pseudonymous which is good enough for most people. 
The transactions are extremely fast and cheap in comparison to the traditional banking system or any traditional money transmitting services. What else allows you to send $10k-$1m+ across the globe in 20 minutes for 5 dollars?
Security  of your bitcoins is your own responsibility. You are your own bank. If you don't care to take the time to learn how to secure your money and instead are looking for insurance and to be babied by the federal government then bitcoin is not for you right now. 
On the protocol level, bitcoin is anti fragile, robust, and has run nonstop 24/7 for the past 7 years with no downtime whatsoever. I suggest you keep an open mind and do some in depth research before making posts like this. Try watching Andreas Antonopoulos videos on YouTube. He will help you to learn a thing or two.
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:26:21
Yes I agree. I think there's a small chance of that happening due to the fact that bitcoin still has the most secure and robust blockchain by far. Another thing to consider is the fact that apart from from the eth/usd trading pair, all other alt trading pairs are denominated in btc. Such as ltc/btc and xmr/btc. There are ltc/eth and xmr/eth trading pairs for example but those get little to no volume in comparison. 
I don't see this changing any time soon. Maybe in a couple of years time things will be different.

Well actions speak louder than words..i doubt Japan would add eth so soon anyways. It's less then 2 years old and still risky to make something like that legal tender.

@_date: 2017-06-08 11:22:22
You don't HAVE to pay a $2~ fee, this is just what's recommended to give you top priority to get your transaction confirmed in the next block (15-20 minutes). Then again I haven't used coinbase in a long time, so maybe they don't give you the option to choose your own fee. If you don't mind waiting an hour or couple of hours, you can pay $1 etc. As the bitcoin price in dollar amounts continue to rise, so will the transaction fee in dollar amounts. 
Sucks for smaller transactions but it is what it is. It will be this way until segwit + lightning network are activated on bitcoin (protocol upgrades in the works)

I'm sorry but just because you don't see bitcoin being used for transactions first hand certainly does not mean the vast majority don't use it. I personally know loads of people that use it on a daily basis for global e commerce/business purposes

Haha ice Poseidon is invested in bitcoin. Cool. I'm not surprised either. I've learned that bitcoin and gamers go hand in hand

I sold a small portion at 2.5k, will sell a small portion at 3k, 5k, 10k etc and will be happy to buy it all back + more on a dip below my sell price. I will always hodl the majority though!

The blood bath may not be over first of all. Bitcoin will most likely suffer the least out of everything so you should obviously be in Bitcoin.
Also the purpose of this subreddit is to discuss all things bitcoin. Not to discuss which altcoins we think are best. It's fine to do so but it's not the purpose as you stated.
Anyways the best alts imo are xmr and ltc. Eth is good too but i really just don't like the idea of the unlimited token cap/inflation eth has going on. I prefer ETC but eth will most likely remain the most  valuable of the two unfortunately lol.

Keep in mind all cryptos are finite like bitcoin. (21m cap)
Ethereum for example has inflation and an unlimited number of tokens. But it was never meant to be a store of value like bitcoin anyways
