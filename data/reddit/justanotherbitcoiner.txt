I was just about to go to sleep. Now I need to stay up and figure out if this is just a temporary drop or the start of a new down trend. Hopefully just a drop.

Depends on how you use it. I see it as a gateway to the fiat system. We need to start somewhere and this is a very good direction. Now I can store my money in a secure offline wallet and don't worry about the bank. But I can still use my bitcoin card to pay in stores.

I wish I was old enough to have control over my bank account back in 2011 when I read about Bitcoin. I basically told my parents about Bitcoin but no one listened to me. In December 2012 I was very luck to find someone in my area that sold bitcoins for paper fiat via LocalBitcoins. Today I am 18 and I have manage to hold on to my bitcoins for 3 years now. Maturity and Bitcoins has nothing to do with each other I am a very immature person and still a early adopter. What matters is your technical knowledge and understanding of computers and most important common sense which has NOTHING with your age to do.

You could use an altcoin like NuBits that is changing the supply after supply and demand to stay within the price of a us dollar. Since a NuBits is always is worth 1$ this would function like a token or store of value when prices are going down. Whenever you want to cash out to you bank account you could use a gateway service and pay a small fee and have your money in a bank account. This is better than having fiat involved directly with the exchange. Since a centralized bank would not make a decentralized exchange decentralized. Plus I want my bank to have as little to do with my bitcoins as possible.

This guy is too old to wrap his head around modern technology. He probably knows very little about technology and computers and their for see it all from another perspective. He doesn't understand the difference between a virtual currency backed by a bank and bitcoin. Cause he doesn't know shit about computer science. But just let him believe and trust his peace of shit virtual banking system I don't care it is his problem. Decentralization is the future and we all know it except this guy.

Nothing is truly anonymous. The anonymity you get depends on how you use it.

Problem is it is extremely complicated compared to other centralized exchanges and how do they deal with charge backs. It is also very slow because you need to wait for the bank which is centralized. I think it would be more efficient if someone could come up with a decentralized way to exchange bitcoins with other altcoins. Then we could just ignore the banks and their reversable transactions. Now people have come up with stable altcoins that track the price of the us dollar like nubits. You could then exchange your bitcoins to an altcoin that tracks the price of the dollar whenever the price of bitcoin is going down. And if you ever want to cash out to your bank account you could use a centralized gateway that take a small fee.

No publicity is bad publicity. I think what happened was overall good for bitcoin.

The problem with shapeshift is their deposit limit. It works great for small traders. And if they increased their limit I would still not feel very comfortable using their service. I know I could just sign up to coinbase but then I would have to verify my identity to bypass their 3000 eur limit. Plus they take 1% fee which is crazy.

2016 will be a crazy year for bitcoin. Block reward halving will happen to. Hopefully we all have learned something for previous bubbles. Better sell off early instead of being greedy.

This is why we need an efficient decentralized crypto exchange. Will this ever happen?
