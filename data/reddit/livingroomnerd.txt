Of course, that would make sense. When you create Bitcoin it would be dumb to ruin your own work. It's understandable from altcoin perspective that they just copy bitcoin so they have no attachement to the principle only the money value.

@_date: 2018-10-04 16:29:51
I don't understand how some are down more than 60% unless they only bought at the top and never at the (current) bottom. If you're down more than 25% you need to review your investing strategy.
The bottom is my break even thanks to DCA.

@_date: 2018-10-05 21:32:18
for this we would need to use the satoshi value, then people would be like i own 500satoshi. just like someone cannot hold 1 gold. I think bitcoin will be more in a store of value than full currency. But still able to be used as such.
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:24:16

From what I understand, bitcoin adjusts difficulty every 2 weeks, a massive drop in hashrate would slow down the networks as it is harder to find blocks. Not sure what it means for transaction fees(up or down).Until thr next difficulty adjustment.

Am i correct? In jan 2014 there was an ATH at 1K then it took 3 years before we reached that ATH again in jan 2017, the price had dropped to 200$ in that time frame. If we see the same thing right now (in a case where history repeats itself) we won't see  the ATH before a few years and we could go as low as 4k.

Here's the thing, I could see happening, not sure if they're safer. But trusting is a big part of current bank system.
1) Bank has full control over your coins 
2) Bank stores your cold wallet
3) Bank multisig wallet
I can't think of anything that sounds safe.
@_date: 2019-02-01 15:58:02
it wouldn't change anything about bitcoin itself. Some people will want a more secure way to save their hard earned money than keeping it themselves.

whatever address you sent your coins to, it is there. 100%. the other party either gave you a wrong address, an address belonging to their second wallet so they could show that it's not there still. Compare the address provided with the one you sent to. and keep note of it, im sure you'll see the funds move eventually.

There's always a risk. The car dealer knows how much you're paying for the car. In both case you're refering to being assaulted for your money. That can happen in any system. You should have secondary wallet for spending in which you feed to new addresses and possibly also bundle your bigstash in multiple addresses. It doesn't make it invisible, just a bit harder to track down. Don't reuse the same addresses.

It depends what you want to put in your blockchain, what information do you need to be validated? And if you need change you could always have timestamp modification and use the blockchain only for audit. You put data in your blockchain that won't change. Auditing companies will need to give certifications, for exemple, you need to be running this many nodes, and they'd have tools to analyze transactions and stuff. It will have nothing to do with the way we're using it with Bitcoin.

Blockchain is awesome. Obviously once big software business start implementing it they won't use miners to keep it true, instead they would use PoS on their users periphirals(this way it makes it decentralized by having lots of nodes). Since it is used mostly internally, it wouldnt be too expensive to maintain.
@_date: 2019-09-11 11:17:16

|  The transfer of the BTC did not show any negative or positive impact on the market. This indicates that it would either be an individual who has transferred the Bitcoin from one account to another or the BTCs were purchased from an exchange platform which was recently created but the volume was not enough to show a significant change in the market. | 
I mean, could be an internal wallet of that exchange just changing their address. Couldn't that individual be an exchange?

Having realtime difficulty adjustment sounds like a better idea. I believe that if at the moment if the current big mining operation all shutdown or there was a catastrophe in China hitting miners, it would take 2 weeks for the difficulty to drop low enough to keep block time 10mins. Meaning during that time, the difficulty would stay hard with much lower hashrate. Slowing down bitcoin. (Thats what i understand from current state of things)
