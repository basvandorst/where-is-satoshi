I have a question I hope someone can help with.
So, I'm getting back into mining and was looking at pools to help with mining and I saw a familiar website.  I set this up like sooo many years back and actually mined for a few hours before deciding "This is stupid and silly" and stopped.
So i noticed the familiar site and attempted to log in with a username I've used a lot and, lo and behold, i have BTC.  Nothing that will make me be able to retire but enough that, after a minor rebound will certainly help me with rent.
I'm jsut not sure how to get it out of slushpool.com into my wallet.  There is no wallet on file that I see but i click on the "Payouts" part for Bitcoin and "your address for receiving rewards" but when I click that, nothing happens.  Nothing happens to most of what I click.  I'd like to be able to get this where I can sell it when it rebounds.
Can you help?

Isnt'... that a pyramid scheme?

I think that this is still a ground floor type thing.  It's popular and demand is far higher than the supply but I think it'll reach a natural saturation point and become more stable but I think you're right.  It could be 3-4 more years before dips stop being 20% or more and it'll just even out.
It's very much bust or buy and people buy up, when it gets high, they cash out and then more people see it falling and it just causes a panic.  It's why the stock markets have things in place to stop it.  Very volatile but I think they'll even out.

Yeah, I am new but not stupid. Trust but verify. I am just not sure how to get bat files to work with the miner. I am looking to mine, not buy. I'll ask that sub though. I know that it's not a way to get rich but it's a big thing and I am just interested in learning only really.

I figured it out.  I didn't have a wallet attached to the account but added one just now and initiated the transfer to it.  How long does that generally take?

I'm actually looking at litecoin.  Do you know much about it?  Think you maybe can help me in PM's with it?  Struggling to get it setup.

Thank you. I am very happy as I wasn't going to be able to make rent this month. Now I can. I'm trying to get back in this but it's difficult to understand some of it. Thanks for the help.

It finally kicked in.  i just had to wait.  It said now it could be 30 minutes to 30 hours but like previously posted, with the volume going it could probably take a while.  I'm just pretty psyched as I mined this like 6 years ago and so it's pretty cool to find it.  I wish I could find the ones I mined further back.  I had a couple dozen bitcoins when they were pretty much worthless.

Hmm, it's supposed to auto payout when it hits the threshold that is set lower than what my current balance is.  It's not made the transaction so there is no Transaction ID as of yet.  I'm still trying to figure it out.  I did all of this when BTC was like, pennies so it's been a long time.

Not faith, they're just stupid.  You'd be happy with a mediocre life never having to work and be financially stable just not loaded.  They want the rich life and are gambling against huge odds to get it.  You're smart.  I'd take it in a heartbeat.  I'm sure if xbtdev was actually facing the 5 million, they would too.
