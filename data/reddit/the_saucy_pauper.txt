Clearly you've never studied alchemy

Yikes. All the more reason to close their accounts I suppose! They're not special, especially on the internet.

Twitter doesn't have to uphold "free speech" or 1st amendment rights. I mean it seems like that's their policy, which is stupid in some cases, but they're not legally obligated to do it.

No, I'm just saying they can censor if they want to.
edit: Also, why do people insist on quoting full comments? It's so unnecessary and douchey.

Definitely true, but that's irrelevant as well. Things like protected speech and illegal censorship only apply to the government. Speaking about the US, of course. I mean, reddit has banned all sorts of content which most people agree upon. They aren't obligated to allow anything and everything to be hosted on their site. Same case for twitter, which is the whole reason why it's amusing that they keep ISIS accounts up.

You know honestly I haven't heard something as insightful as this before. I myself have been struggling to fully understand transgender people, and now that you've said it, it seems so ridiculous to define someone by their chromosomal makeup since we don't specifically do that for anything else. I hadn't really thought about it before. Thank you.

You can't just generalize by saying "everyone agrees x is a sport" because I guarantee you'll find dissenters for a lot of sports that I can think of, namely golf or more dexterous things like car racing. And defining the Olympic committee as just one of them doesn't really portray the weight it actually has compared to other multi-sport organizations like the Boys and Girls Club of America, YMCA, and various other "community" organizations. Most "sport organizations" focus on one sport.
What I suppose I should really be saying is that, honestly, it's not really up to an organization to define what a sport is. Many people consider chess to be a sport, and many people consider competitive gaming a sport. So, yeah, you could consider Jenga or Yahtzee a sport, I guess. I just don't think many people would extrapolate the logic that far.

The point is it's the fucking OLYMPIC COMMITTEE. Saying "only" sounds silly, as if to say it's grounds enough to dismiss chess as a sport because the only organization (besides the World Chess Federation) that officially recognizes it as a sport is the group behind the Olympics...

I mean judging by how not-funny that was, I guess you don't either. I mean it's not offensive. I don't really give a shit. Just nobody's laughing at your shitty joke. I'm pretty sure it's not specific to this subreddit.

The funny part is you're blaming the "butthurt" for what appears to be your lack of humor.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:16:39
Haha. I don't even want to fight anymore. I think I love you now. [Here's my peace offering :D](

I don't think "balance" is necessary. Fairness, of course, is mandatory, and being one-sided is usually wrong unless facing opposition which is complete nonsense, but it is not often that both sides have equal weight behind an argument and they must be treated accordingly, not equally.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:09:34
"only" officially recognized through the *Olympic Committee*.
lol
