What's wrong? It's a Bitcoin Lightning Network or hub, operated by PayPal.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:21:34
What if they offered guarantees etc. I'd imagine they would stick to something similar to what they offer now.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:54:42
Why would they buy Bitcoin just to use the PayPal LN Hub? For the slightly lower fee?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:36:48
Yup, as trustless as a LN can be and within the regulations PayPal adheres to.

OR he lost his private key to the coins and therefore had to go into hiding to sulk and because he knew that it would not take off if others knew that even the creator could not secure his key...
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:48:51
Maybe try localbitcoin.com?
As with anything, do your research before buying. Don't let people on here tell you what to do.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:18:32
It's not one specific scenario at all. There are a ton of them, all of which arise from high fees. A store of value is fine, but it still has to be usable. Otherwise I might as well just be storing gold and sending that with next day delivery to somebody when I need to make a payment.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:50:35
Yeh I watched the video. It doesn't explain how a $5-10 transaction can help someone living on $2 a day. Even if they have to open a single channel a month that's a lot of money. And opening a single channel a month and making all of your transaction through that seems to be the centralisation he is worried about.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:59:39
This doesn't work at PayPal is reversible for up to 6 months... Nobody would take that risk.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:38:44
Relax. A 448mb backlog is nothing. With 15min blocks that will clear in just 112 hours ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:03:13
Nearly 0 is ok, but who would bother if the initial channel setup cost is $5, $10 or $50?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:02:44
And it still didn't confirm I guess? You can get it accelerated for another £10 if you need!
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:03:47
Aaaand who will confirm the transactions for you on whatever you've decided to be Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:58:15
You can generate new receiving address for every transaction and you should. Nobody will know that they belong to the same wallet. However, when it comes to sending the coins back out, you'll probably put a number of those transactions together to make a single transaction and at that stage it becomes clear that they did belong to the same wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:17:50
OK... Proof of this? And if they are just exchanging their BTC to BCH is that market manipulation or just normal market transactions? Or what are you suggesting?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:04:57
You missed an option. It's a POSSIBILITY and as with most financial decisions, you should hedge your bets.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:24:17
Just a difference of opinion. And what makes it "his" exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:28:14
 is one where you deposit BTC to trade with. They also used to offer the BTC/USD pair but are now working on putting that into a separate service, called 1fox I believe. I'm sure there are plenty of others.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:53:29
"The number of mobile phone users in the world is expected to pass the five billion mark by 2019." So yes a lot of them have a smartphone with an internet connection. Other than that, there are ways to make transactions via SMS or something similar. I don't believe you need a smartphone to use M-Pesa for example.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:16:04
That would offer you 0 security. It would take a single person to come in with an old S7 miner and mine a longer chain and re-write your transaction.
The Bitcoin network has value because it is the largest and most secure network.

Everything is possible. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:53:15
Wallet is no issue at all. You don't have to show any ID, you can set it up on any computer or phone... Download the btc.com or Bread wallet for example and that'll be that.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:56:23
Bitfinex and Tether? Or what are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:53:59
A pyramid scheme is a scam and someone will always lose. Bitcoin is more like mining gold.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:02:00
Yeh I saw a post about that today... Sort of goes against the original ethos ofBitcoin though right? And closer to something like a Parity wallet or a bank...
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:13:42
It's all decentralised. It is difficult to control it. Plenty of good developers/researchers would have told you if there is some sort of flaw or scam but there just haven't been any reasonable arguments. The people that call it a pyramid scheme just see the price going up exponentially and assume it's a pyramid scheme without knowing what they're talking about.
Just think about it. It has utility. I can send you $100 from across the world without going through any bank or company. I can store $1000 in a wallet and keep it out of reach of any government. I can store a 24 word mnemonic in my head that is worth $100k, cross any border completely naked and then simply recover that $100k on any computer or smartphone. Bitcoin is amazing, a pyramid scheme will just sell you an overpriced anti-aging cream.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:58:29
Any proof that it's spam?

If we're talking about the same video, Andreas says he wants to help the unbanked, living on less than $2 a day. Not sure how $4 transaction fees help with that...

@_date: 2017-11-11 14:48:30
BCH is getting its EDA updated on the 13th though, so depending on the BTC:BCH ratio at that time the miners might not switch.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:11:08
Not all altcoins are equal though and the markets are highly irrational so be careful, do your research.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:55:58
If you don't understand that you don't need to be 18 to setup your wallet I think you need to do more research. That's the whole point of Bitcoin - it is permissionless and nobody is in charge. A wallet is essentially a string of numbers and that's it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:09:54
Hedge your bets you mean? Holding a portion of your portfolio in fiat, in altcoins or an "altcoin".

A difference of an opinion is not a scam.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:34:20
What does that prove exactly sorry? That someone is spamming the network by giving away $600 fees to miners?
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:32:54
Yes of course USD is the safe asset for most of the world. In countries like that the inflation you get from money printing is not as much of an issue as most in the Bitcoin community will have you believe. Lets just hope they are willing to take that extra step and use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:02:30
Has anyone written this up?
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:27:18
Ok then. Show me proof that it has been used. How it is damaging the network. And explain exactly how it is unfair.
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:38:40
HMRC for tax related stuff, treated like any other asset if you're selling it, but no VAT charged on it. 
FCA if you are looking to conduct any Bitcoin related business. They're quite open, get in touch with them and you can setup a meeting quite easily. Not sure if the UKDCA (UK Digital Currency Association) is still active but they were a few years ago if you need any further help. UKDCA is just a private association.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:20:00
I'm neither a shill or naive, I just have a different opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:31:18
Some people just aren't big enough to be invited, that does not make them non supporters...
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:52:12
Yup, Segwit2x and Bitcoin Cash seem to be the other clients you are talking about, and people want to run them, but then Bitcoin Core shouts things like "attack" and "corporate takeover". People are making the choice to move away from the Blockstream run client. Simple.
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:42:06
I never said that they do all agree, just seemed to imply that everybody who didn't sign the agreement is automatically a non-supporter.
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:01:06
Just posted this a minute ago somewhere else, the livelihood of the developers depend on having Blockstream survive, not Bitcoin. So if they can implement/resist changes which would hurt or benefit either of those, which one do you think they would choose first? It's a massive conflict of interest.
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:58:27
But YOU are the person you are talking about. You are the CEO of a startup with "some" VC funding. But here you are arguing against the vast majority of miners, mostly not funded by VC but by crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:38:42
Lets not argue about that one. I think 80% of miners and that many businesses indicates consensus, you obviously don't.
Why would you need replay protection if you're just upgrading Bitcoin?
This point I don't know about. ~3 months is exactly what people are getting since the NYA was signed isn't it? A few months seems sufficient to upgrade all the nodes but if it is an issue, I believe it should be resolved with the Bitcoin client sending out a notification or something like that...
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:27:53
So you're assuming that just because those people didn't sign the agreement they do no support Segwit2x? It's only practical to get so many people together and the biggest ones signed it, the rest aren't needed but that doesn't mean they don't agree.
UASF did not scare the miners at all, it was a pathetic social media attack to which a UAHF was a perfectly reasonable contingency plan.
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:51:41
We're just going round in circles here. I say it doesn't mean that and you say it does... For example, I didn't vote for Obama (because I live in the UK) but I did support him.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:19:12
Some businesses did stop accepting it due to the fees (amongst other things like price volatility I'm sure). Segwit scaling means slowing all other transactions? I'm not even talking about the last month where Segwit has been active, I'm talking about the 2 years prior.
Yes that's my point - its dominance is decreasing relative to alt coins. Of course it's still growing, but not as well as it would have otherwise.
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:48:51
I didn't say that they all agree, you just implied that everyone who didn't sign the agreement does not support it. I'm just saying that I'm sure that some who didn't sign do/will support it. 
Kraken is a perfectly reasonable exchange for example. They did not sign the NYA so they are on your list. But come November and 2x is activated with 80%+ of mining power, Bitpay, Coinbase, Blockchain, Circle, Korbit, Xapo, all fully support Segwit2x and you think Kraken will just sit on the sidelines hoping miners/users come back to the Segwit1x chain?
"Show me any devs or users supporting it" ? - Don't be ridiculous, I won't even bother answering that.
UAHF didn't happen as far as I'm aware so not sure what you're talking about.  - buzz word with no meaning
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:54:13
Yup BCH was indeed a chain split, most would argue it isn't an altcoin because it is more true to the original Bitcoin vision but at the moment it isn't 100% Bitcoin either. Segwit2x however will take the majority of miners with it so it will remain BTC for now... What dictates Segwit1x being "the real Bitcoin"? Nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:26:35
But you can judge the situation correctly? I agree that it's a power struggle, and a very dirty one. I know which side I want to win but I cannot be certain of anything, and neither can anyone else. Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:19:08
0 interest in what the ouija board is telling us, thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:49:38
1. Block height 494784, so roughly mid November I believe
2. Yes it was locked in at the same time as Segwit was, the New York agreement was the reason both got activated.
3. Yup - a simple way to scale Bitcoin
4. Bitcoin Cash split with replay protection, making it easier to spend on the 2 chains that were created,  because they knew they were going with minority mining power. Segwit2x does not need replay protection because most miners and many exchanges support the agreement. Bitcoin Core is making it messy by saying their wallet will reject the Segwit2x chain.
5. Can't tell right now but no replay protection makes it difficult for both to survive. But I'm not sure what the Segwit1x has going for it compared to Segwit2x or Bitcoin Cash.
6. Bitcoin Core has no value. Bitcoin is independent of Bitcoin Core. Any good developers it has can migrate to other projects, the rest can retire. Confusion is only created by the stubbornness of not willing to scale Bitcoin.
7. Again, difficult to say, same answer as for 5.
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:43:16
Yup I guess it is and you're making my point - you call it "ownership of the code" which doesn't sound very decentralised. If Bitcoin Core owns the code, and they are heavily influenced by Blockstream, then a single Fiat backed company owns the Bitcoin code? Doesn't sound good...
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:17:45
Nice. Will look into it. Must be decent investments.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:34:35
And I think that's exactly what is happening. Of course I'd like to go back to 2010-2014 when everyone was happy and developing everything together but when things get back, sometimes a limb has to be amputated.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:08:27
Not a very good list as it just shows any Bitcoin related business that did not sign the agreement? I mentioned this point before, does not mean their support or not support the agreement...
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:25:26
You did not provide any proof.
I just don't see a problem with it. If it's something that makes mining more efficient then fine, that's exactly what ASICs did, and other companies will continue to innovate.
The only thing I oppose is empty blocks which is of course not great for the network. But if I remember correctly there is another reason for this (waiting for a block to propagate).
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:55:03
Not impressed by that list at all. And I have 0 interest in the Luke Jr. poll which could be gamed very easily.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:20:17
No problem!
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:03:11
If you look at it as a chain split and you want 2 coins, then maybe not. If you look at it as an upgrade to Bitcoin, then it's perfectly fine.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:59:54
Yup like you say the power struggle is what keeps it honest and that is exactly what's happening here...
True mempool is smaller than it has been over the last year or two but sadly that's because people are not using it because of the fees and also switching to other cryptocurrencies and that makes me VERY sad. Remember when Bitcoins dominance was above 90%?
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:13:39
Bitcoin Cash was a response to the proposed UASF and not wanting Segwit added to the protocol.
2x is part of an agreement that was signed by 80%+ of the miners and many [exchanges and bitcoin companies]( - the agreement still stands and is separate to Bitcoin Cash. 
Segwit2x was a compromise, Segwit was only activated thanks to the agreement and the 2x part is also locked in.
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:24:40
Ok good luck.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:24:10
Oh no, my response isn't for you either, I want people to go out there and verify this for themselves - go ahead people, compare the lists of companies [here]( and [here]( and make up your own mind.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:30:20
That's a terrible source. 20% dropout rate? Those signatories haven't "moved on to Bitcoin Cash" - they are still part of the agreement.
And the "cartel" of one (Blockstream) is the best path?
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:01:44
Man there's just no logic with you.
You provide the source, I tell you it's crap, you tell me to contact them to fix it?
And yes Segwit2x is just as open source so there's no issue, and there is no conspiracy theory from my end. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:37:28
Those 2 years ago everybody was saying that the Chinese miners were the ones that didn't want any blocksize increase because their internet couldn't handle it... What happened to that?
I also remember Segwit blocking BU just this year...
I don't see how S2x is not an improvement so I don't see how calling it off would solve anything...
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:49:30
I'm also glad that we agree about Bitcoin having been taken over by Blockstream and a few other bad actors many years ago, and the current takeover is finally correcting that mistake.
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:10:07
Not me, I'm not involved here. I know my place. All I can do is vote with my money.
Yes I know that you and I can contribute, but we can't make the final decision to implement now can we? So it's the Core of Core who decide, and that's where the centralisation lies. I'm sure most Core developers are great, and they'll continue to be able to contribute to any other software implementations.
It seems to me that most of the work was done prior to the current team taking control so don't present it as though it would not have been a multi-Billion dollar product without them. And one of the main reasons that it is a multi-Billion dollar project is due to decentralisation - Bitcoin Core is the opposite of that.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:01:48
EXACTLY - and I explained to you WHY they are being ousted - because Blockstream is in charge over there, one single company... No thanks.
Sorry genuine question, where has the 4x come from? I think before Segwit activated it was supposed to allow for a 70% "blocksize increase"?
Bitcoin Cash is and will be perfectly fine.
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:34:14
No problem. The whole UASF and Bitcoin Cash thing was quite interesting, you should look into it. Painful to watch at times with the amount of stupidity going around though... Some things don't change...
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:45:27
The core of the Core devs working for and being paid by Blockstream seems to prove otherwise... Not that I am agreeing with you on with regards to Segwit2x being "business controlled".
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:16:04
No legal basis is required. It is a decentralised currency.
If you didn't agree to anything then you have no power. If you had a Bitcoin company or some miners then you could make yourself heard. You're just a user, and Bitcoin was setup in a way to incentivise miners to make Bitcoin work for the user - that is what they are doing.
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:31:10
Yup nothing wrong with that. Unless you are working inside Bitcoin Core and there is a MASSIVE conflict of interest.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:30:44
1. There is absolutely nothing about Segwit1x that would make it "the real Bitcoin".
2. Corporate attack happened years ago when Blockstream took over Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:29:34
You're right - the NYA agreement is a corporate takeover. [58 Bitcoin companies]( got together to to takeover Blockstream - the one company controlling Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:22:16
Same applies to you though - you're assuming no support - what indications do you have? I just see a few vocal users, quite a few paid for Twitter accounts, and those on the payroll of Blockstream...
Indeed they MIGHT but my argument is that they would not do that as it would hurt the price of Bitcoin and they would lose out. They only do what is best for the price of Bitcoin.
Ok fine they don't choose for you, but they can define utility. Feel free to stay on the Segwit1.0 chain and try to trade amongst your friends, but without miners to verify your transactions what's the point?
OK so if you think the 2x part of the change is not simple, what could your opinion possibly be on Segwit?
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:15:15
Slippery slope argument eh? Today we let them 2x (for the sake of the users, to allow the network to scale) and 10 minutes later they're printing themselves $1Bs? That's not how it works... They do not have the power to do everything as they would lose support of the users and businesses, price would go down and they would lose all their money. They need to act to benefit the network and that is the beauty.
Unfortunately, they do choose for you. If you want to be the one with the choice go setup a Bitcoin business or buy/make some miners. That's what the system was designed for.
It's for the good of the network. A split does not have to happen, it's just a simple upgrade. Confusion arrises from this whole "no2x" thing. People just need to embrace it, prepare for it, and educate the "confused" - that's how you make it a seamless upgrade. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:26:36
It's not an attack - it's an upgrade with no need for the old chain, so why would you bother with replay protection?
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:01:31
58 is quite a lot of people to get into a hotel room... I see that very phrase used quite a lot here. 
What is your opinion on Blockstream employing so many Bitcoin Core developers? Does that not seem more centralised and more of an attack on Bitcoin to you?
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:55:08
2mb will make it SO much more centralised that it is worth keeping a single FIAT funded company in charge? Nobody knows how much centralisation will be created from either bigger blocks or the Lightning Network.
Segwit2x is not trying to fool anybody, and if everyone follows the recommendations at the time of the split nobody is going to lose any money and nobody is going to benefit from anybody losing money.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:06:49
Yup I guess you stopped hearing it because people just moved on to other fallacious arguments once that was disproved.
Segwit2x is also just software, so is Bitcoin Cash...
Contention arising predominantly from Bitcoin Core and Blockstream. Otherwise it's all good. 
Corporate takeover is hilarious. Yes you could see it as a corporate takeover, 58+ corporations taking over 1 - Blockstream - which was the true corporate takeover of Bitcoin about 2 years ago.
All morning the core of my argument has been that that Bitcoin Core is HEAVILY influenced by a single, fiat funded corporation - Blockstream - and I haven't received a SINGLE response or rebuttal to that argument.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:21:22
Core was not invited because they are heavily influenced by a single company - Blockstream - THAT is a small group. Their incentives simply don't align with what the Bitcoin network needs to scale and do what it was designed for.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:17:18
1. You and a few of your friends aren't a big sample. And anyway I am talking about technologically non-contentious, i.e. 75% of the miners which is a significant majority.
2. There were also a lot of people mining with their CPUs and GPUs who have dropped off the network but as a whole the network has grown stronger. Technological improvements also work to reduce the costs again over time.
3. OK but if they are on chain then security must be weaker? Somethings got to give right?
4. OK I see, and Bob explained this too. I guess I just put more value on the miners than you do.
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:16:02
Thanks Bob.
1. Can you explain why a non-contentious HF is dangerous? It's planned at 75/80% of hashing power isn't it? So if that much hashing power is behind and people have a few weeks to adjust what is the issue? I'm guessing there have been a number of HFs with Bitcoin in the past as well as other cryptocurrencies.... Have there been any major failures?
2. PARTLY agree with this as I currently run a node and after I come back from holiday it takes it quite a while to sync with the network, BUT it still works and it's simply technological progress. "The current 1mb limit is almost a whole floppy disk! How can you send that across every 10min!". My 5K iMac has 7 times the number of pixels compared to my previous HD iMac so it is a bit slower but somebody had to take the plunge and I wouldn't go backwards...
3. I accept that SegWit might clear the backlog but what makes me uncomfortable is that transactions are being handled off chain by a third party which seems to increase centralisation and some fees are also going to them I assume? 
4. coin.dance shows ~30% support for SegWit and ~40% support for emergent consensus so what makes you say most of the ecosystem is ready for SegWit?
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:07:47
1. It's consensus amongst the miners rather than your friends, I didn't call the miners a sample. They are (critical) stakeholders.
2. Why not now? Can our internet not handle 2 or 8 or even 20mb? There's a massive transaction backlog and I don't see why we should be waiting to clear it?
3. I don't understand this point. Why does a blocksize increase with segwit weaken security?
4. I would personally say that you need to rethink your assessment. I know that the miners don't care about anything other than money but fortunately for us, the system has been designed in such away that that aligns perfectly with the needs of the users. Miners have collectively spent millions if not billions on mining equipment and electricity to secure the network. Like you say, they're only there to make money, their equipment is best used to mine Bitcoin and not so useful without Bitcoin, if the price of Bitcoin was to collapse or the users were to start using a different currency they would lose most of their investment - so they really HAVE to care about what the community wants as otherwise it will just collapse. They have a MASSIVE stake in the game, and it is very clear what their incentives are and that is to make sure that Bitcoin survives as long as possible. How can you prove what exactly you contribute to make your opinion worth any more than 0?
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:57:28
OK I feel like were going round in circles with most arguments here.
On you last point though. As I explained in my previous answer, Trump would approach them and whether they accepted the deal or not they would know that the users would revolt, tanking the price and making Bitcoin useless, I would therefore say that they would TRY TO RESIST making the deal. In any case, 100+ other countries would remain from which you mine.
And funny you mention core principles, as surely having a third party handle your transactions for you was not in the whitepaper?
