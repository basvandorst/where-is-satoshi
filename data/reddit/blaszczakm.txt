hey it's serious business. As [REMOTEADMIN.store]( we've already sold hundreds of VPS for FIAT. Now we are starting to accept payments via LN :)   
We have  secure data center - PCI DSS ,ISO 9001,ISO 27001,  GDPR, Thier 3    
For many years we have been providing server administration service and performing penetration tests. We take this seriously.

Hi :) 
If you want, you can buy VPS from us using LN -  [  We have recently launched this service to see the actual adoption of LN.

We have just recorded the first purchase via LN :)

If anyone of you would like to run a full node, I prepared a VPS offer with 300GB and 500GB SSDs with the possibility of payment via Lightning Network - [

I also have a similar problem. I deal with security and administration. But there is nothing to create here. Over the past 2 years, I have helped stock exchanges and bitcoin-related products improve security. I have reported many bugs.
But next, there is nothing to create here :( From my work nothing was created, I only improved the products and only in terms of security.
Recently, in a few days, I learned the basics of NodeJS and created my own website with payment service in the Lightning Network [ in this way I want to see how many people use LN.
Maybe you can also create something of your own or let's do something together? :)
