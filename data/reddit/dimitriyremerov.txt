Well, I'm not suggesting to consider cover losses of them trading (which is closer to gambling), but rather losses for the theft (which is closer to a disaster like an earthquake, rather than gambling).

23 BTC lost on Mt.Gox account. Feeling OK, as I still have 11 BTC in cold storage and some fiat savings. So I didn't lose everything, only half of everything.

I would certainly do it as long as I'm not doing it alone, but as a group of people who decide to do this for the best of the whole community.

No, it's not going to stop it. Bitcoin would be fine without them. But it will happen later than if the Mt.Gox disaster wouldn't happen. It will definitely be a step back.

Does not require. Bitcoin will be stable itself without this step.
This is just an opportunity to boost it.

High risk trading is different than risk of losing a deposit. You can be really safe on high risk trading by operating only with 10% of your deposit, knowing the other 90% is safe.

Well, some were careless and risked. But some perhaps didn't follow the news and were just trading. They weren't really expecting this.

That's a valid point, but it could be done with a proper supervision board from Bitcoin foundation.

That's different. If I donate money to help those who need (which I do, by the way, but 10% of my income instead of 100% suggested by you), I lose value. What I suggested is an investment, because it would probably increase value of the bitcoin and they can be better off in the end.

It's not about ruining someone. Maybe they lost their $100 worth in BTC and it's wasn't a big deal for them. But they are not going back to BTC community because of that. Less people in the community means less transactions means less adoption means less value.

So there is a mechanism in place which decreases difficulty every time there's less than 6 blocks mined within 12 hours. Looking at this:  I see the possible explanation. Because a certain hashpower whale does not want BCC to succeed it arrives randomly, mines 4 blocks in a row then leaves. I believe this is done to prevent lowering the difficulty. This way, if BCC gets one block per 2 hours, its next normal difficulty readjustment will happen in 20-22 weeks. Any thoughts?

Just one comment: I can gererate billions of Bitcoin addresses per second, not just one. I'm simply a person on a 7bln people planet. There are people who can generate trillions. Does that mean that if we all (7 billions) start pressing button to generate a billion new bitcoin addresses per seconds instead of one, we'll hit a collision within a few years?
