Does anybody know if purse.io works for Australia?

Love Living Room of Satoshi! I've paid a lot of bills with these guys. have you any plans to add POSTpay or whatever the Australia Post version of BPAY is called?

I understand that. I feel like I know what the password is but there are so many variations of the potential password it would be easier for me to use software to go through a list of all the combinations. 
Because the amount could possibly only be 0.02btc I don't want to pay a service to do it for me, but it is also possible I put a larger amount in there. Really just want to find this hidden wallet so I know how much it is.

Thanks your tool looks interesting, however it probably won't help me as I don't know the address of the wallet. Unless I'm reading the code wrong?

I can't think off the top of my head which bills I've seen it or used it on, but I'm pretty certain it is instant where BPAY takes a day or so to register a payment. At least that is my understanding.

Thanks for that link. From reading that is sounds like the pass phrase is the 25th word of the seed, so in theory I could use my 24 word seed and run a wordlist of known passwords as the 25th seed word?
I don't suppose you could point me in the direction of software that would do this? Wouldn't feel comfortable entering my seed on any website but if there was some open source solution that would be great.
