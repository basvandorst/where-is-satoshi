The population has been brainwashed to think anything Russian is bad, so it's pretty dangerous to link the good Bitcoin name with something we're being programmed to hate.

If you've been reading between the lines, the US hegemony has been going after nation states that operate outside the globalists banking cabal. There's a reason our current enemies are Russia, China, Iran and it's because they're looking for alternative currencies to conduct trade.
It's no coincidence that in the name of trumpted up claims of  "humanitarian violations" led to toppling governments of Iraq, Libya and a failed take over of Syria. 
Associations of Bitcoin with Russia right now is a very dangerous to the future of the exchanges in the USA.

Seeing all these downvotes and being a huge fan of Alex as he breaks stories into the clinton crimes makes me questiin.

You're just reading the SJW smear review if you say lobster guy and that's all you get out if it.  First they called him a white supremicst but that didn't stick so they say lobster guy.   I encourage you to actaully view 30 mins or 2 of his lectures to form your own opinion.   The SJW bullying tactics don't fly with me and a lot of others that educate themselves on these topics.

Tired of hearing this women supremecy stuff. 1 in 4 articles on linkedin is women in tech nonsense. Women don't choose to study stem fields yet they are getting more opportunities in the work force displacing someone that studied. 
The women I see in yech actaully coding always pair with men and the men actaully do the work and the women it claim it as their own.
In short, I'm all about eqaulity of opportunity and against eqaulity of outcome.

Seems like there is a smeer campaign against him at this point. Just way too much vitriol for this guy.   I know he met with mark karples from mt gox and assured everything ok, but maybe he didn't know.  The selling explosives was just firecrackers and he wasnt the only one doing it back then.   What else?

Your arguments have been debunked ad nauseum. Watch Jordon Peterson.

I'm willing to research it. The example you gave regarding family court tho.. Have you watched documentary on family courts?  They are extrememly biased against the males so no credance in that claim.  I was hoping you had more. It sounds like the left calling donald trump a racist without any evidence. I dont follow herd mentaility group think and thats what got me into btc in the first place.   There is some truth to what roger ver said and it really does appear bitcoin core has been fractured politically and they are dragging their heals on purpose.  In my eyes its broken in its current state and it appears to be a sabatoge as soon as they refused to resize blocks or make them dynamic sized.  There also is documented censoring in this subbreddit.   Theres a flight from btc due to this, into alt coins.  They dont seem to want to fix the higg fees that is killing adoption. Its almost as if they like the high fees and dont want to realize Satoshis whiye paper thst says CASH in the title.  Human element was always the weakest component of digital currency and I am sad to proclaim that Btc has been sabotaged from the inside.  .
