The Profit from is from trading. 
The 2 1080s are currently only getting around $3 USD per day before subtracting electricity costs. They mine 24/7.

Binance is easy enough. I have been into cryto 24/7 since November 2017. There is so much to learn. I am constantly evolving my thought process when it comes to coins. I mine with 2 1080s. I started out with the mindset of hodl. But now I day trade the ups and downs of various coins. I am only beginning my journey. I have turned $1000 into $2700 since November 2017. 
I have put a lot of effort into learning technical analysis. I thoroughly enjoy this aspect of trading. I see it as a hobby. I only play with money that I can afford to lose.

My 2 GTX 1080 only give me about $2 USD in coins per day. Back in December/January I was getting $10. Not including electrity costs.

In my opinion, not currently worth it. I mine with two 1080 cards 24/7 and net about $1 a day per card (not including electrity costs)
If market rebounds it will become more profitable. 3 months ago I was getting $6 a day per 1080

Why would one need complete privacy in regards to a LEGAL transaction?
I'm trying to understand the need of privacy coins.
