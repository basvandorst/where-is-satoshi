Normally you would give the cash first, as once the coin is sent it's pretty much irreversible and you could just run.

If you build a mining rig with gpus you won't be mining bitcoins, rather altcoins, as bitcoin gpu mining is not profitable anymore.
If you want to mine bitcoins, you need an antminer s9.
Investing is a different story, if the price of bitcoin crashes, you lose your investment. But if the price crashes when mining, you only lose a % of the current money made, and continue to earn the same amount at reduced prices.

Minergate is a POS.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:06:41
The way it's been done is they submit a bunch of transaction with high fees. Miners will prefer these transactions and complete them first. Scale this largely, and the entire network is congested, and the only way for a normal person to get through would be to pay $20+ in fees, possibly more if they scale it.
The reason it costs so much is that when they're paying $20+ in fees per 1 transaction a second or so and run the attack for a few hours, maybe longer... That amount adds insanely fast.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:18:51

Bitcoin mining is done on asics, which you don't have here.
You can mine altcoins on GPUs, and keep them in those alts, but you don't have access to GPUs.

@_date: 2017-12-24 16:06:28
Yes, it has payed off for me, and still is. I started mining just over a year ago and have been ramping it up and expanding recently. One piece of advice I can give is not to spend more than you're willing to lose. While everyone thinks that it's a get rich quick and easy, it's possible for you to lose money. The price of the coin could crash, you could wake up one day and your machines are no longer profitable, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:22:52

Otherwise, GPU mining.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:14:13
You could buy it through bitmain.com, the manufacturer, but they only accept BCash and run out quickly. The prices used to be cheaper ($1500 ish) but they raised their prices due to profitability and demand going up.
Other than that, there are many shady sites that will try and scam you. Asicminermarket.com is legit, but always out of stock. You could buy it on eBay/Amazon, but you will pay significantly more, sometimes double or triple.
Also, you need to buy the power supply as well because it's not included. Use the APW3++, it's the official and reccomended one.
Make sure you don't have a contract clause somewhere that could get you in trouble for power usage, as one unit uses a lot of power. At .1kw/h power costs, this unit uses around $3-4 in power/day.

Bittrex technically could do something about it, since they have the private keys they could create a bitcoin wallet with the same public key derived from the private key of the bcash address, and then send you back the funds.

They both do the same thing, in holding your private keys. The problem with online ones are in most cases you lose access to your private keys, meaning you technically don't own your bitcoin anymore. On top of that, online wallets leave room for attack. Offline wallets are way more secure but less convenient. That's why hardware wallets are so popular, they combine the security of an offline wallet but make it way more convenient.

The problem with holding your money on exchange is that you don't hold your private keys- so you don't technically hold the money.
On offline wallets, you control your keys- your money is 100% yours.
Hardware wallets are just a safer way and convenient way to do it. They hold your keys for you in a physically secure device.

I would highly recommend slushs pool. They're one of the original and always have been very important in the expansion of the Bitcoin network.
You could solo mine, but it's not worth it. Solo mining is more of a lottery, per-say. You're competing against all the other pools, but if you do get a block you get the current block reward of ~12.5 btc. The odds of this, though, even with many Asics is extremely small and not worth the effort.

You could do that if you store the wallet file/private key, but it's easier/safer to just spend the ~$100 on a hardware wallet.

Willing to bet one of your balls on that?

If you're holding large amounts, get a hardware wallet. 
Otherwise, take a look at one of the recommended IOS wallets [here]( Pretty much you just want to be able to control your own private keys.

Here's a very simple way to think about it. This also applies to general encryption.
Let's pick two numbers. Say 1230 and 4239. This will be our private key. Now multiply them together. 5213970. This will be our public key.
See, it's easy to verify that they match when you have both numbers, just multiply them and see that they match. But if you just have the public key, how are you going to figure out the two numbers that where multiplied?
Now, in real use case situations, these numbers are significantly larger, and do a lot more than just multiplication.

3. It's up to you. Nothing can be predicted.

A hardware wallet is actually recommended over a paper wallet. It offers the same amount of security with a lot more convenience. (See: Ledger Nano S, Trezor, Keepkey)

If they are double spent to the same address, one tx will drop off the network and the other will transfer the coins as normal, so no worries.

Coinbase is just bad to hold your coins. Buying on them is fine most of the time. Use GDAX (Owned by coinbase, more advanced) for smaller fees.

Bonus- not on bitcoin, other coins, yes.
