If you can’t afford a hardware wallet, you shouldn’t be investing in speculative assets

I am experiencing the same issue, guess I should have checked this subreddit first. For reference it was GDAX to breadwallet in my case. Also has been about 15 mins for me and so far no coins in my wallet
UPDATE: mine also just came through, about half an hour of waiting total. Maybe they do batch withdrawals, or perhaps the network is just busy. Oh well, got my coin so I can't complain any more

Unless that is the only bitcoin you’ve ever owned, they are probably calculating your cost basis using a different method to reduce your tax liability. For example, they way you described  it in your original post it seems you are assuming First-in First-out (aka FIFO)
However, consider this scenario (numbers rounded for simplicity):
March 2017 purchase: 1 BTC for $500
September 2017 purchase: 1 BTC for $5000
December 2017 sale: 1 BTC for $15,000.00
Under FIFO, you’d be paying short term capital gains (which is just added to ordinary income) on a net profit of $14,500. However, if you use LIFO (last in first out), your tax liability is based on only $10,000 instead. Both are short term gains so you would add the profits to your ordinary income
If you had long term capital gains (holding period &gt; 1 year), your the calculations would be different because long term cap gains are capped at 20%. Obviously this will depend greatly on your cost basis and tax bracket. 
Disclaimer: I am NOT a tax professional! This is for informational purposes only, not advice 
EDIT: misread the date in your original email, I thought it was 2017 for some reason. In that case, using your March 2014 cost basis makes it a LONG term capital gain as opposed to short which adds another wrinkle to the equation. Does bitcoin.tax let you manually choose your cost basis method (sometimes referred to as “tax lots”)?  You should be able to mix and match until you find an outcome with the lowest possible tax liability
