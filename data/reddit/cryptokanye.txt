Yeah, I feel that. It's something about how in this whole article you see people who've completely forgotten why we were excited about crypto in the first place. Who talk about it "decentralizing the world" but are so caught up in the wealth and the joy of an ostentatious display, that they don't even notice this woman. The woman who we all believe should gain the most from crypto through decentralized systems and a redistribution of power is the woman who leaves the party alone. Because parking downtown is expensive. No one in that room seemed to realize she was there, yet she trusts us to make sure this all works out for people like her.

The most interesting part of the article, imo, is the end:
As the holiday party filled up, a cryptocurrency rapper called CoinDaddy — Arya Bahmanyar, 28 — was getting ready to perform.
Formerly a commercial real estate agent, Mr. Bahmanyar works full time at CoinDaddy after becoming a self-described crypto-millionaire (“you think I would dress up like this if I wasn’t?”). “Right now all our entertainers come from outside crypto culture — not inside crypto, and we’ve got to change that,” he said.
He pointed to his outfit — a long white fake mink coat, gold-heeled shoes — and said, “It’s gold, right? It’s gold. It’s a niche, and I’m going to fill it.”
He says he is going to shoot a music video soon for a song called “Lambo Party” and another called “Cryptomom,” about “all these moms are pumping in their children’s savings accounts.”
Maria Lomeli, 56, came to the party to find the people she had put a lot of trust in. A housekeeper from Pacifica, Calif., she said she had invested $12,000 in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks after reading about it in the news.
She wore running shoes and a zip-up jacket that said, “Cinemark, the best seats in town.” She worked there cleaning out theaters. Now she cleans houses. Banks, she said, were designed to steal. Taxes left her supporting a government that she felt didn’t support her.
“Charges for sending money to my daughter, interest on our loans,” she said. "And then the money we pay in taxes goes to wars and whatever else they want.”
She found a Bitcoin event in the city and asked people there how to buy Bitcoin on her phone. She invested $1,000. It went up. So she put in $10,000 more, she said, along with $1,000 in a currency called Litecoin. Both her children have discouraged this.
“And maybe I’m going to lose it,” she said. “Maybe I’m going to keep cleaning houses. But something is telling me I can trust this generation. My instinct is telling me this is the future.”
She had to leave the party early because parking downtown is expensive, she said. She zipped up her jacket and left on her own.

I don't think that's true. There are investors who own 20000000 times the amount of stock I own. That doesn't mean I'm going to stop investing in the stock market. There's someone out their who owns a nicer car than I could ever have in my life. That doesn't mean I've decided nice cars are not for me.

I think it's possible to ban crypto to the extent China had banned Google. They don't need to ban it from absolutely everyone. But if they make it super inconvenient and useless to the masses, then it's as good as banned. And if Google is any indicator, that doesn't mean crypto will die. What I'd expect is for China to make it illegal for businesses in China to accept crypto. They may not care about Ripple or bank usages of crypto for transfer purposes? But they might have some more complicated laws around banking. They could block exchanges via their firewall. They can't enforce it being illegal to hold crypto, but if they make it super hard to convert renminbi to crypto and make it impossible to spend said crypto in China (or if you're a Chinese citizen), they'll have stripped the fundamental value of crypto for the masses.
That said, I don't think that'll tank crypto long term. It's not like Google is suffering from not being in China. I don't fully understand how Russia influencing protocols would work. 
I do think Bitcoin can be overtaken in the future by other crypto. The transaction times are slow, the energy used per transaction is irresponsible if not ludicrous, and fees are too high for an everyday currency. I understand people say bitcoin could be a store of value and other crypto will be used for day to day transactions. But I don't know that other cryptos have been tested at the transaction volume bitcoin's at. How many cryptos will get clogged the same way? Plus, companies are starting to accept btc as a payment. So at some point merchants are going to recognize the problems and it's going to be swapped for something else. Unless, of course, all these problems are solved before the shoe drops.

Realistically, I think the fastest way to get out would be alt -&gt; LTC/ETH -&gt; transfer to cash out exchange -&gt; cash out. And that's not all that fast. Especially if everyone is doing it. (Think how frequently Coinbase and gemini go down). I suspect that you either should be ready to ride the bubble out or have some stop limits set and hope they trigger right even if the site is down. Because you're right, I don't think there's a safe and quick exit strategy. Unless you trust...tether. Which I don't know if anyone does...

Oh yeah, I totally didn't get to the btc theory yet. I definitely think we'll see government pushback. And given the success China has had blocking international innovation and just making a homebrewed version...it would be weird if they _didn't_ block crypto and come out with something state sanctioned. Do you think they'll be as successful as this author thinks they will?

Yeah. This is an unpopular opinion, but I do think BTC is overvalued right now. I don't think we're getting as much value out of it as the cost would suggest. I think if it solves its technical problems (which it likely will) it will eventually be worth much more than it is now. But I don't think it's worth $15k right now. That said, I'm definitely hodling.

Idk. I feel like crypto might be due for a correction. Imagine paying for electricity in your home before the light bulb had been invented. Btc feels a little similar. I don't think you can exchange btc for goods and services to the degree one might expect at these prices. I feel bullish on crypto long term, for sure. But I don't think people are buying the electricity because they own light bulbs. They're buying it because they are pretty sure light bulbs are being built. Or worse, some are buying it because other people are buying it. That doesn't feel healthy to me short to mid term. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:20:21
I don't think that's true. It won't be accepted as a currency until people believe they can own enough to buy a car or put a down payment on a house with it. And that is possible. In fiat that's only achievable buy owning hundreds if not thousands. In btc that's achievable by holding a few (and in the future presumably a fraction of one).

No, just a brain fart. So the first theory makes some sense. I'm definitely not an expert in macro economics. It sounds like it depends on the US falling into a recession in 2018.

Yup! It's too late. Bitcoin has reached this price purely based on its current technological capabilities. No one expects more than these ~750,000 addresses to be used. The main goal was to be able to buy things on Overstock.com. Now that we've reached that, what more could we ask for? It's peaked: like Amazon back in 2011 when it caused Borders to go bankrupt. No one who bought Amazon after that made any money. After all, Amazon is just an online bookstore. And bitcoin is just a decentralized global currency meant to be used only by a million people on a handful of websites. Adoption has reached full saturation.
(Not trying to be mean, just funny. I apologize if that was too sarcastic. I do understand where you're coming from. If you're asking if it's too late to get in before the next big scandal causes a huge dip in price: no one has a clue. But if you think this bus is going to the moon-- does it matter which bus stop you get on at?)

I think we should be aiming for i18n money transfers and not coffee purchases. I don't see the technology doing anything to decrease the transaction cost and confirmation wait time as drastically as its needed for someone to want to buy a coffee with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:54:11
It's not that people feel secure decentralized currency is a "waste of energy". It's the amount of energy needed for a transaction and how that increases as difficulty increases. And how the energy usage of the entire system increases as bitcoin gets more popular. People feel that we can be doing better. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:08:20
I think about what I can afford to lose. And whether or not I think real world adoption rate of bitcoin has matched the exponential price rise. Then I end up in the opposite problem of thinking there's a bear around the corner when historically, that's not a good bet to make

^ That. I feel like that's the pattern with all recessions. Something happens. Everyone needs money. Everyone sells investments so they can use the money. Investments fall in value. As people have money, they see how cheap investments are, they buy them again.

I mean, it's possible that crypto pushes CC companies to up their game and the end result is that in the US neither is better. However, in a country like Zimbabwe, whose currency is not as stable and global as the dollar, crypto might be hugely beneficial.
That said, the possibility of payment systems changing so drastically as to be almost unrecognizable (e.g. Not even needing to go to a cashier, taxes automatically being deducted because everything is on the blockchain, etc etc) is non-zero.

I don't know where here is, but in my experience ATMs are free if they're owned by the bank you use. (Or if your bank has deals or promises you rebates etc). But otherwise they can cost 3% or a flat $2 charge or something. Which still speaks to your point of it being significantly less than even a _discounted_ 7% fee.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:27:41
I think the dot com bubble example is relevant for exactly the reasons you described! (2 and 3, at least). Yes, there's not a lot of money in the space right now. And honestly that's a good thing because any bubble pop will be self-contained and hopefully not affect the broader market. But reasons 2 and 3 describe both the dot com bubble and what's happening now: 
2) Just like in the dot com bubble, _if_ we're in a crypto bubble today, than people invested in real tech with a good team behind it won't suffer long-term. But people _are_ investing in the crypto version of pets.com! Just like in the 00s, investors understanding that this tech is here to stay but not knowing which projects are going to thrive means that the prices for everything from crypto!Yahoo to crypto!Amazon to crypto!Pets.com are rising rapidly: particularly with the help of whales playing numbers games. It's not an absurd comparison.
3) Just like during the dot com bubble, I think all of us on any of these crypto subs believe that the technology is here to stay. Just like during the dot com bubble, it all comes down to doing due diligence to make sure you don't get swept away by empty promises just because others around you are.
Furthermore, I think the reason we're all reminding each other to do due diligence is _because_ of the dot com bubble. If tech didn't bust the way it did back then, we'd probably not care at all about where our money was going. Million dollar ICOs for projects that haven't been built yet proposed by a team none's seen the work of wouldn't concern us at all.
Basically, I think comparing the dot com bubble to this current trend is a great way to remind ourselves to be careful of what we invest in. And not get swayed in the long term by whales making prices skyrocket for a cryptocurrency we think is useless. I think people say "It's not the same!" because we aren't at the popping stage of the bubble yet. And maybe we never will be! Maybe the tech will prove itself very obviously but over a long enough period of time that people will move their money without being caught unawares and losing everything. Maybe people were smart enough not to invest in "pets.io"! Who knows. But I don't think it's absurd to compare this potential tech bubble to the last confirmed tech bubble in order to inform our investment decisions. After all, history rhymes.

@_date: 2017-06-23 04:04:36
You'd think that, but that's untrue: 
Notice that a majority of these charge less than 7%. The highest is 8%. (I'm assuming you're smart and wealthy enough to take out as much money as possible at a time to decrease what percentage of your transaction $5 is. I don't know for sure, but in the past I've been unable to take more than $100 out at a foreign ATM). And notice that 8% is still lower than their non-discount rate of 9%.
Unless you're saying the exchange rate is different from the ATM fee.

Well, 7% is actually pretty good for the shit show that is Bitcoin ATMs. Amusingly (given all the harping we do around crypto being cheaper), fiat ATMs have significantly less fees.
@_date: 2017-06-22 06:47:30
Right. Like sure, banks charge money for exchanges. But even that wasn't 7%, iirc. Its usually a $2-$5 flat fee. But the larger point, as you said, is that we tout crypto as a solution to obnoxious fees set by 3rd party middle men. Hopefully things change soon, but in the meantime I do find it amusing (and also important to be aware of) how far away we are from what can be achieved.
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:38:30
Yeah, I feel that. That's really interesting. I didn't think about diversification. I've mainly been focused on "does this technology have the basis and community to be worth investing in?". It sounds like litecoin does, even if it's only starting to be recognized and noticed.
If litecoin were to fail, why do you think that would be?
