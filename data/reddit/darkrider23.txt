I feel for the guy, but what? Him losing the money was negligence pure and simple. He shouldn't have invested everything he owned into bitcoin. Sorry, but that's the truth. Don't put all your eggs in one basket and expect to make a ton of money without any risk.

Malleability issues were known about since 2011 if I'm not mistaken. It's something exchanges knew about, including Mt. Gox and Mt. Gox did nothing about. There was no secret really. Just gross incompetence.

If it's legal and reported, then just deposit it. I think there is more to OP's video than what the person lets on. I deal with a lot of people that deposit thousands into their accounts monthly and the worst thing that happens is we ask them where they get the money, a report is filled out with that info and sent to whatever Government agency. I'm pretty sure if something like this is reported, the IRS compares your tax return and the money being deposited to see if they can find any big discrepancies. If they can't (since it's reported, right?), then they drop it.

No idea, but good luck. I personally choose the route that doesn't leech off society by paying my taxes.

You would be surprised. Banks can be pretty picky with choosing their employees. There are droves of people constantly lining up for even part-time teller positions. The shitty ones that do the bare minimum and don't put any effort into the job don't last long.
Even so, you would still have to get by their managers and all of the AML and BSA analysts that banks employ to check on these things. Not to mention all the fancy software that actually does the majority of the work by flagging suspicious transactions.

The reporting requirement for a CTR is any cash over $10k. If you are consistently depositing amounts like $8k every month or $2k every week or whatever amounts on a scheduled basis, you will get a SAR filled out on you eventually. It's just a matter of the teller caring.

You really think the average corporation is going to like a currency with as little regulation as BitCoin has? Unless the money is being  converted into USD and deposited into a bank account instantly, no corporation is going to want to use a digital currency that has little regulation. It's just too much risk.

Where are you paying 5% for a foreign wire transfer? That's just ridiculous. Shop around. I work at a bank and the fee is a flat amount per transfer.

The idea isn't to predict an increase or decrease in a short time. It's to invest in companies after you've reviewed their financials and their short and long term prospects. If you can't do that on your own, then you are gambling.

This dude's basically making himself a huge target. Who the fuck advertises to the general public that they're buying bitcoins or litecoins? It's just asking to get stolen.

That's the first sign that you shouldn't be an investor (Just buy index funds instead). You're getting emotionally attached to your purchase. You can't do that or you will just bankrupt yourself. I doubt you'll take the advice, but you should really just sell everything and stop buying.

The top 25% pay 87% of the Federal Income Taxes. It's a simple Google search to find that out. Please don't be that ignorant.

Meant to say -60%... Anyway. It doesn't matter how much BTC has gone up this year. It matters when you bought in. If you bought in at $1,200, you're down more than 60% right now. There's the problem when you're trying to use BTC as a currency.

Bitcoin hasn't been around anywhere near long enough to actually prove this to be true.

Everyone said the same thing with Apple heading to $1,000. Look at it now. It will be fun to watch though.

The other times where the value of your currency is -60%.

It is if they want them purely for the investment and they think it'll only go up.
