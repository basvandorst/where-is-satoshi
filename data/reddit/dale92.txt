Or a right side up boom for those that shorted. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:04:43
Why didn't you buy a few months ago when it was below 5k??
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:35:23
I cashed about a month ago. Feels good. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:34:52
Nah mate, still going to crash another 8-9k. Bubble is bursting!
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:09:06
Damn, sorry to hear you're still holding bitcoin. Hope you can get rid of them before they're completely worthless. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:24:25
I mean it's still got 8-9k to lose from the price. Everyone is jumping ship. The bubble has burst. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:37:44
Ah, you've gone from denial to anger. Hold on buddy, it's only gonna get worse. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:18:04
Throwing away your money for a one-in-fourteen million chance of winning? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:58
I bought in at 800 and sold at 19,500. Treat my bitcoins nicely. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:06:01
Okay, if it's horrible as a currency, what is it good for?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:58:55
Why does more people investing mean it won't collapse? Surely that's more people that will panic sell, especially since they aren't experienced investors. 
And yeah I was the same, chucked in $200 AUD a few years ago, sold when it reached 20k US and took my 8 grand! Thought it was a neat idea back then but transaction times and fees are ridiculous now. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:05:55
Did the rest of my message send? I listed reasons why I thought it could be overpriced right now. Let me know if I need to resend. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:57:34
I bought in in 2013 or 2014 whenever the big spike was and it crashed hard. Figured it was the end of it but only this year my coins became worth more than what I paid for them. Obviously now it's significantly higher but people were saying the same thing as you are back then. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:52:28
I'm just wondering, haven't really paid any attention to bitcoin in years (other than how much mine are now worth!)
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:02:38
You asked when it crashed and stayed crashed for long. 3 years is a long time IMO. Especially with the attention span of the average bitcoin "investor". 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:15:54
Hahaha will do
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:10:31
500 - 300 isn't a crash!?! What is then!!
Also it was about 1100 to 200 if I remember right. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:45:31
Or keep falling. 
Or stay the same. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:49:50
Maybe it's overvalued right now though? Could definitely be (and very much looks like) a bubble. I mean, I definitely thought it was exciting when I first was buying them obviously years ago but now I see how slow the transactions are and the high fees, there's no chance of me buying more to use. There's so many other options out there, while none of them are perfect, I've never once felt the need to spend the bitcoins I've had in my wallet over the past few years. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:14:13
Nope, takes days and costs a fortune to send/ receive bitcoin. Hence why everyone is jumping ship.
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:00:21
Yeah but if he wasn't so hungry he could've ordered just one  pizza and he'd still have 5000 BTC...
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:19:07


Oh that solves it then. Apple is doomed, as you and your friends didn't buy the latest model. The fact that its the highest selling model of all time doesn't matter at all. Just the fact that you and your friends didn't buy it.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:19:54
Upward trend on sales.
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:07:59
I am mistaken then. Which model was the highest selling?
@_date: 2014-02-08 06:07:45
Tu quoque.
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:14:18
It really got people talking because of it, too. Perhaps it would still only be worth $40 today if he hadn't done what he did.
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:15:01
Just pointing out that you didn't respond to what I said, just attacked my argument.
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:42:02
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:15:04
Not if they mined them then and sold them at the peak last year...
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:14:04
I'm sure there's a lot of people on here that wish bitcoin markets closed when it dropped only 10% in one day!! 
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:48:02
Eh, I bought in 2013 off some guy on this sub. Sold it all in December last year. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:48:40
Markets shut down if there's a 7% drop so that can't happen. Regulated markets are very different to the unregulated wild west of bitcoin.

He was riding a motorbike in Thailand while not wearing a helmet.
@_date: 2015-02-28 11:20:23
Doubt anyone would kill themselves in that way. Seems more likely to be an accident but one that could have been avoided or at least made non-lethal through protective equipment.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:30:55
Wait, are you serious or is this a troll?
You have 480k worth of BTC?...
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:45:32
But better than all the Kanye rest?
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:25:52
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:08:04


I didn't attribute anything to him, merely replied to the things you had.
I don't doubt that he does get shit done, but person of the year? You truly consider Musk to have had the biggest impact in the whole world in 2013?
I think the two biggest things Musk has done is be the first private company to send a space craft to the ISS, which was first done in 2012.
And obviously produce the Tesla Model S, again released in 2012. 
What has he done in 2013 to make him the person of the year for 2013?
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:38:26
And if bitcoin goes down by then you'll be more than happy to reimburse him I'm sure?
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:26:57
And why is that a reason to not include it in a picture that shows the "bubble popping"?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:57:49
I can sell you all mine @ $900.
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:18:06


Not quite ;)
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:50:16


They do and they are. That's what causes the price to go up/ down.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:45:45
And save backups to USB/ CD. Store in different places, including off-site.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:09:12
But if you had've entered the wrong address with BTC, you'd have just lost your money completely. This way you get to keep the money. I don't understand.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:14:19
Maybe he only hat 507.39?
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:44:17


Cali is just one state in one country. This is the Person of the Year from the whole world. Selling a lot of products in one place shouldn't qualify you as person of the year, as plenty of companies obviously do it. Someone's gotta be number 1.


I don't know if "remaining" the only private entity in the space game makes him qualify to be person of the year. Wouldn't that make him probably person of the year next year too, as he'll most likely still be the only private entity doing anything real in space?


Paying off a loan makes you person of the year now? Shit, where's my award? Oh wait, everyone pays off loans, its what you're supposed to do. Paying of his comparatively much, much smaller loan does not make him the best person of 2013...
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:37:16
Okay, I just searched the whole picture. Where does it say that?
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:22:34
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:15:40
That's usually why you read the comment you're replying to...
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:19:16
You do realise this is right?
Why don't you go to and advertise that your store now accepts CAD or GBP? Cause that doesn't make any sense, that's why.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:35:44
You realise you've got like, $300 max, right?
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:45:38
What do you do when you get your local currency? Buy stuff! Plenty of websites where you can buy things from. Check out: 
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:09:01
Where did you get the 2 year figure from if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:20:20


That wasn't me...


That's not what the OP was saying though. They weren't saying that Musk had done nothing, but, if you'd scroll up to read:


@_date: 2013-12-04 00:21:30
Do a search for bitcoin or anything related in your emails.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:54:45
If you were looking a couple of hours ago it reached 900...
Do whatever you like. Its your money.
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:30:12
I'm from Australia so don't have Amazon.
Does Amazon take other currencies other than USD?
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:20:47


As opposed to bitcoin which is a bunch of numbers sitting in computers burning hydrocarbons and helping no one?
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:26:32
Glad we agree that just buying into bitcoin and litecoin is not diversifying.
I do have a problem with you saying, "If the bitcoin network is attacked by someone, litecoin network will be humming along." I really don't believe that. If bitcoin fails for whatever reason, why would people move to litecoin? I believe something completely different would take over, rather than changing to a very similar crypto-currency.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:47:02
No joke. We don't even know is Satoshi is a real person, and Musk is just a business man doing business stuff. Hasn't really done anything in 2013 to make him the best person of the year. Shit, I love what he's doing, but person of the year?
Snowden has made the biggest impact this year, for better or worse.
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:32:06
Disable your email account, turn off your phone then re-enter your email account. Bam, all the unread emails are gone.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:21:57
So why is that a reason to not include it in an example showing the "bubble popping"?
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:27:41
Scroll up, I think you'll find you weren't replying to me...
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:10:59
Least scientific poll ever?
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:00:17
Yeah. I remember when I first tried it it ended up costing me about $370 pet BTC. Was so annoyed at myself for paying so much!
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:35:37
"You always have the option to pay in your local currency or US Dollars." What if my local currency is BTC!?!
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:49:09
Since no one's answered your question, I believe the answer to your question is due to several factors:
1) There is no central authority that makes and distributes bitcoins, as there is with centralised currencies.
2) Bitcoin is still well and truly in its infancy. The exchanges are all also still in their infancies. Everything still hasn't been made idiot-proof, as current buyers are still early-adopters. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:47:45
Buy as much as you possibly can, take out loans, get money from friends, family etc.
Just buy, buy buy. NOW!
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:16:26
Add it to your computer's dictionary. No more red squiggle. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:16:03
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:31:45
Shit, buying at 15 cents and selling at $15 is a bloody good investment, though!
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:15:51
Far out, how many of these questions are on here.
Nobody knows. It is impossible to know. Buy at your own risk.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:08:07
And you're basing that on?...
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:45:46
I guess we'll have to put that to the Kanye test.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:35:11
Couldn't you just not send the money if it goes up? Or am I missing something.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:04:18
I just don't see how investing in two typed of cryptocurrencies is diversifying.
That's like investing in two types of retail companies to diversify. What if something happens to the retail industry? That's why you diversify, invest in retail, property, construction etc.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:36:41
If bitcoin network is attacked, surely you would realise the litecoin network is also vulnerable? Causing the price of both to plummet.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:09:49
Fortunately the Guardian Person of the Year isn't decided by an argument in the comments of @_date: 2013-12-03 04:14:44
Yeah, those are some pretty strong claims considering he begins his post by showing he has absolutely no idea how BTC works.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:01:13
And this is the worst.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:54:34
Sure. And I was just countering your points as I don't believe that Musk is the person of the year this year.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:25:27
Why did you not include the April drop? That was quite large IIRC.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:46:03
Paypal can't be "intercepted by wifi" either...
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:18:44
Yeah, just like MySpace will always be the number 1 social network and Nokia will never be overtaken as the number 1 phone company. They just have huge headstarts.
Shit happens fast, yo.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:18:18
Where'd you get that from?
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:18:40
How the hell would you sell $100m worth of BTC on craigslist?!?
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:15:42
Good thinking. Why don't you walk up to the bank and ask for a loan too? Heck, why not go to a loan shark? You're sure to be able to pay them back with the crazy earnings you're going to make on this guaranteed investment!
Jesus Christ...
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:09:20
There's the answer I was looking for ;)
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:53:04
How is buying litecoin diversifying?
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:44:40
And save backups to USB/ CD. Store in different places, including off-site.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:27:03
Warning: You will be paying A LOT more this way.
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:28:43
I think its just the way he writes. Sounds like a bit of a douche, tbh.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:44:49
1) Growth at that rate is not sustainable. People would have started selling when it hit such high values.
2) When people start to sell, the price goes down. People panic and start selling their own, further driving down the price. Circle repeats.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:45:17
I dunno, this year he has been doing his Kanye best.
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:38:56
Yeah of course. Its still in its infancy.
