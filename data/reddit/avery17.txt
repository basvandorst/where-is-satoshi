I selected that option, thanks to slow ass bank transactions, nothing processing on weekends, holds on my account for gas etc. I can easily overdraft my account.

I'll be sure to purchase when it comes out! Keep up the awesome work.

This app is gorgeous. I love it! Anyway I can donate to you?

You do realize that something like 60% of the world doesn't even have access to the internet right?
@_date: 2014-09-14 23:51:32
I love these kind of challenges. I may make one myself...

Dude... empty your recycle bin.

You know what we need? A QR Reader app that scans Bitcoin QR codes and tells you information about the address such as transactions and balance similar to blockchain.info. Right now all I can do is scan it to send Bitcoins, what if I just want to see what their balance is real quick? Right now I have to hobble onto my computer and figure out how to turn a QR code from a picture into a web address.
@_date: 2019-11-09 05:22:36
And so are pants.
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:09:41
So I should move all of my BTC coins into new addresses before attempting to gain access to any BCC coins associated with those private keys since the keys are exactly the same for both currencies. Am I getting this right?
@_date: 2016-12-03 00:05:09
Yeah how dumb is that? Everyone should just be able to print their own money! /s

Yeah so 90%.... Not 900%

Just because a second bank loans it out again doesn't mean the first bank loaned out more than it had to begin with. You're not listening to what I'm saying. This is just the mathematical nature of fractional reserve banking. That doesn't mean it isn't sustainable, in fact it's extremely sustainable. Banks have been doing it forever, and it works. They make a good profit on it. It can even be done with bitcoin, a deflationary currency, as long as you're smart about it. The problem begins when you make a lot of risky loans like what happened in the 2008 housing crash. If you make safe, smart loans and keep a good reserve then I don't see how it's a bad idea. Personally I think everyone I'd making a bigger deal out of this the. Is necessary. Obviously we need to put a shit ton more regulations on Banks to reel them in but the real issue isn't fractional reserve banking, it's money manipulation through artifical inflation by printing money to settle debts. Not to mention attaching interest to freshly printed money... Currency should be created for the people without interest.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:21:37
I don't think you understand how fractional reserve banking works. They don't loan out 900% of what they take in, they loan out 90%. So in your example it would be 9 dollars. The 1 dollar extra is kept in reserve.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:45:38
If the reserve ratio was 0 I wouldn't be able to withdraw money from my checking account. Not to mention that 90% of 90% I just 99%. It never goes over 100%....
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:55:09
I got money that says the program just pulls currency icons out of the current Unicode standard and uses them automatically and this wasn't a decision by microsoft.

It would show up in the block chain, so yes. It hasn't.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:28:58
I saw it just hit $150. It dropped pretty hard.

Its only the last 4 digits of your SSN, is it really that horrible? Quit being so entitled.

Am I too late for the free gold?

This sounds highly improbable. I would Have to be keylogged by the site or a virus for them to break the encrypted wallet.

Your post was deleted.
@_date: 2013-10-12 09:06:28
I don't get it... can you explain it to me?
@_date: 2013-10-12 20:08:49
Oh please. I don't care about the coins you won, it really wasn't that much anyways. I'm pissed off because this is rigged for a stupid amazon referral page. This isn't the first time you've posted an amazon referral link, and that's all this is really about, isn't it? All anyone has to do is look through your post history to see your plethora of referral links. This isn't about Sweet Baby Ray's company making money, it's about you making money. So what if it costs you a transaction fee, right? 
Even now you are still trying to sell it to me. Good commitment but I'm not buying your bullshit.
@_date: 2013-10-12 09:00:26
Damn you... What was it?
@_date: 2013-10-12 09:13:40
So the coordinates meant nothing? Is this just some weird ad campaign?
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:04:16
@_date: 2013-10-12 08:48:29
Well I don't know about everyone else but I'm gonna keep working at it until the bitcoins aren't in that wallet anymore.
This guys a phony.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:42:49
What's so wrong with blockchain? Am I still at risk if I have dual passwords and two factor authentication? I don't see how it's any more dangerous than having a wallet stored on my PC.
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:01:14
This captcha is especially weak.
Using only numerical digits makes image recognition that much easier as one would only have to worry about recognizing 10 different characters.
Monospaced font, now we can know the exact X, Y, width and height placement of each character every single time the page is reloaded.
No interference whatsoever.
This is childs play. I actually tempted to take this up as a small challenge right now even though I've never touched captcha or image recognition before.
@_date: 2013-10-12 08:37:35
That's what I'm going with, but I don't think he's answering any questions...
@_date: 2013-10-12 19:21:11
It probably has something to do with your shitty ad campaign.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:25:32
That's debatable, I always check both sites and it can go either way on the pricing.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:30:11
You got downvoted because of your terrible attitude. Bitcoin wasn't made for you to accept, maybe your audience just doesn't know about it yet. Tigerdirect is much more likely to have a tech savvy audience that knows about Bitcoin. There are plenty of merchants that make regular sales in Bitcoin.
But so what if people aren't buying with Bitcoins? Is it really that big of a deal that every single person in the world hasn't fully adopted Bitcoins yet? They are continuing to garner support quite rapidly and show no signs of slowing down. It's only a matter of time before you make your first Bitcoin sale.
You can always drop out if you don't like it. Quit complaining about something that costs you nothing to accept.
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:35:33
Give out large amounts randomly to people you don't know.
@_date: 2013-10-12 10:11:36
That's what I was thinking. He ignored me when I asked if it was an ad campaign as well.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:55:36
Which is, again, highly improbable. This is a seriously idiotic reason to not use blockchain. If/When a blockchain employee steals someones bitcoins, it's not going to be the dude with 2 bitcoins in his wallet. More likely its going to be the guy with 1k+.
@_date: 2013-10-12 09:18:24
OP, please explain the logic of this thread because I am completely lost.
What does BBQ Sauce have to do with coordinates, or were they just unfortunate randomly generated characters? Why such a specific brand of BBQ Sauce, I've personally never heard of it.
Okay now I'm kind of pissed. This all seems like a really weird ad campaign right now. Amazon referral link multiple times, hyping the extremely specific brand product and using the full name of the product every time you mention it. I don't think OP and are the same person, but they are definitely working together to do something.
Obligatory reference.
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:18:16
Yeah except it was a small group of people who tanked Enron. if Bitcoin is going to do what Enron did then pretty much everyone has to agree that it's worthless. Bitcoin is not the same as Enron, Enron was a company and Bitcoin is a currency.
Am I wrong thinking this? What scam are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-09-15 22:46:22
I'm willing to bet would have some answers.
@_date: 2013-05-23 04:10:56
The fact that he may or may not be racist, homophobic, or have some other extreme/different beliefs or views does not and should not undermine the fact that he is correct in this matter.
@_date: 2013-10-12 08:51:53
These are the correct coordinates.
