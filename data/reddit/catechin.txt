You didn't even look at what I linked.  You realize you can use external HDDs with a Pi, right?
BTC's at 148GB, so I'm not sure what your point is either.

HODL is nothing more than a misspelling of hold.

What?  No, the point is you were full of yourself with false superiority over the coin you've decided to go full tribal mode on and were simply stating lies.
Crypto isn't inherently a competition, it's not necessary to "beat" the other coin.  That said, it's a plain fact right now that eth is pushing far more transactions per day than bitcoin.  That's not arguable.

Exchanges facilitate trades between two people.

Those are still transactions on the ethereum blockchain, though.  They still use eth and participate in the blockchain.
Instead of actually admitting you were wrong about something you just redirect the conversation.  I never said any particular coin was superior nor did I mention anything about scaling.

That's... not how that works.

I'll take the 300 million if you don't want it.

Ah, my bad, thank you for correcting me.

Last I heard, no one.  I don't think there's been any real development for doge in years.

Exactly, hence why I was asking.  I've seen plenty of places and people think they're running backups when it's actually replication.  See: people who use Dropbox or Google Drive or something similar as their "backup" but have it set to automatically sync.  If they get hit with a cryptolocker they lose their backup, too.
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:18:55
A replication is a dynamic copy.  When a change is made to the original the replication is updated, either in near real-time or within a few minutes.
A backup is a cold copy.  It isn't affected by anything that happens to the original.
Thank you for answering, by the way.

Are they replications or true backups?  Just want to clarify.
