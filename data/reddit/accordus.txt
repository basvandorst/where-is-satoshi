Nice. 
Now where to store it? I'm a bit worried about house fires for reasons. What you think is the best way to make sure you can get to your hardware wallet, but it'd be safe for long time. I just don't want to keep in a house. It can also be stolen too.

OK, but if demand continues to go down (as we can see it does) there must be a point where miners simply can not afford to pay the electricity.

My fear is not technical. I think the problem will be that big miners (the ones who has to pay for electricity) will leave the ship sooner or later given the price continues to drop as we have seen for the last few months. 
And then only experimental people will remain with very strong belief in BTC but that will be INSUFFICIENT to make BTC what we think it should be.

Because in reality the actual price of 1 complete bitcoin does not matter at all. I know it is radical thought and cries for hundreds of downvotes, but it is still true. You can use fractions of bitcoins just as good as complete ones. It does not matter how many zeros you put ahead or behind the the number. 
Now the market is coming off of the top of the bubble slowly and more and more real people and companies start dealing with bitcoin, and that is good. 
There is only the average electricity and mining rig investment cost setting the price for bitcoin. The protocol can work fine at very low or very high nominal value of one complete unit just as fine. This is actually one beautiful thing about bitcoin.

OK, I am ready to take it.
Can you research some betting site? I am kind of busy now for the research part. And let's make the numbers clear then.
Anyway as we will be putting the BTC into escrow, we should consider it *spent as of today*. (With a value of $52) So theoretically it is biased against me, but I will consider it to be $52 lost against my today electricity costs (4 days), and $whatever when I win in one year.
And also, I sold off all my BTC earnings recently (doing scrypt mining) and have to wait few days to come to 0.1 BTC again.

Turns out that that Karpeles face was actually a very tired face of searching for the key. Remember, he said two things&gt; "Technically not lost, but not acsessible for the time being" and that "giving up is not the way they are doing".
For me it makes perfect sense, and I feel that I interpreted the things correctly by then.
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:50:14
I think he keeps trying to solve his shit. And he is already really tired now. This is the reason of his behavior.

"For months now, Bitcoin ~~soothsayers~~ deniers have proclaimed that the virtual currency is going to End any day now." "Of course, none of that has happened. And it's exceedingly likely that none of it will."
"When they realized the ~~flying saucer~~ ultimate Bitcoin crash of MtGox wasn't going to come, and that ~~Martin's~~ deniers' prophecy had been wrong, something odd happened: Rather than giving up, the ~~Seekers~~ deniers' began furiously calling up newspapers and trying to spread their message as widely as possible."

You are f wrong.
Less supply =/= higher price. High demand  = higher price. This is economincs 101. There is a very low supply of stainless steel toothpicker (however it is very easy and cheap to make) but its price is NOT high. There is no demand for it.
And high demand only comes from people who tend to **use** bitcoin. It would be very hard to make high demand from hoarders.
And even if "Less supply = higher price" would be true, can you please prepare a 3 pages mathematical document how many users you have to kill in a minute to be able to *decrease supply* as 3600 bitcoins are poured to the world each day.
And how many business owners you have to ask to drop bitcoin as a payment option? And how do you plan to tell Overstock to stop their acceptance of BTC? 
Basically are you trying to tell people to stop using bitcoin and only hoard?
Or are you planning to create some quotas for every wallet that it will not be able to *spend* the coins for some time? How do you plan to push these reforms through the foundation?

I wouldn't necessarily call it a lie.
First, it was a Mandalah document stating the coins to be lost. In their view they are lost, maybe they do know the things behind and for the time being they reference to it as *lost*.
Second, the IRC interview with Mark seems to me as the most telling thing, Mark himself considers the coins to be "temporary unavailable" and that he is not giving up. So he himself is not saying the coins are lost.

Sort of like: "A small thing only we need you as your *last* job here in MtGox."
@_date: 2014-04-12 09:34:32


Yeah, qouted search is horrible yes.
But a more common text block gives other results then Storj: "is being developed as we speak" And strangely only some of them actually contains "is being developed as we speak" in whole despite being in "" when searched.
So I guess they do have some "indexing and searching" but that is really bad. 


Actually not. I was about to link this very same link, but dropped because my explanation would have been long and somewhat vague. But here we go: 
"...crawling. That means we follow links from page to page. " This must be true, yes. I am only saying that this link-following stuff is a minor job and gives a low quality part of their result generation. 
"We sort the pages by their content and other factors.". Keep in mind Other factors. If there would only be honest indexing and link-counting, then there would be no Other factors. 
"And we keep track of it all in the index." It does not specifically say they are building and index from it (the link contents)! They keep their data in *an index*. Big difference I would say. Kind of regular marketing speech. Actually they are telling the truth. There is an index (which is not discussed) and there are data traced (referenced) in the Index. As a marketing and graphic professional this part of this site is simply beautiful to me I can tell that. Big word: INDEX. Not Indexing. Amazing. 
" We write programs  &amp; formulas to deliver the best results possible. " No contradiction to what I am saying. 
" algorithms get to work looking for clues to better understand what you mean. " No contradiction to what I am saying.  "Spelling" and "Synonyms" = "Did earlier users wrote this word differently?", "autocomplete" = "Did earlier users chosen the Autocomplete result instead of typing all the way through?", "Search methods" = Probably one of the most important. Just look at the drawing here. Is it voice search (maybe from a smartphone) or is it a typed search? Both will give you VERY different results, "Query understanding" = Marketing speech or whatever.
"Based on these clues, we pull relevant documents from the index" Does it say ANYTHING is being done to the link contents? No. It specifically does not say anything. 
Due to stupid (purposeful?) webdesign here comes a tricky part: You have to refresh the page several times to actually be able to read the texts in the circles of the "Rank the results for 200 factors" part. "Site &amp; Page quality", "Freshness", "User context" "Safe search". Again, nothing about **content**. Pure social related stuff here. I would say "user context" is the most important thing here. And I can imagine things here being applied like location, screen size, age guessing (possible through available databases), previous searches and so on. This is the weird part.
And then come the 400,000 direct evaluator part: 


"variety of rating tasks"
Uhh, this was fun to go through.
I like Google, so no offense here. I came to this understanding while setting up some AdWords campaign earlier. They simply obfuscate their true working, but this is normal business life. 
Did you ever think about why "Google is your friend" came into our everyday speech? Because your *friends* and your would-be-friends (*socially matching society members*) were searching the exact same searches what you did. And Google kept remembering and showing results of **their work**.
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:00:54


Well, I am more familiar with Google searches and stretched a bit to Youtube. I do not actually know about Youtube. But Google works by guessing your behaviour (wished results) on previous results (clicktroughs) of previous users's searches for the same (or similar) query. (And all these are referenced through your location and social data.) 
You can find out about this method very quickly if you want to buy search advertisements from Google. This fact is somewhat obfuscated, but can be seen clearly. If you ask the Adwords page about your rates and possible CTR results for a given word combo, you will be listed with all the similar word combos which your Adwords campaign will be utilised against. And if you execute those searches they will give exactly the same results. So no matter which actual words you use from the given pool within the certain topic the result page is the same (and somewhat precalculated) And actually it is sorted by relevancy of how soon previous users NOT come back to do a new search with similar word combos. 
This is the reason why you are prompted with the finishing possibilities while typing. (And also Google result page appears even before you finish typing.)
And in Youtube I just tried this (type by characters and wait some seconds between each...)
By this you should be prompted with "wood snake cube puzzle". (Depends on your previous searches too...)
So there must be very limited actual *searching* behind. At least not what we tend to think.

I guess most people do not check anything. They check the actual moment of purchase (donation) circumstantially. I did not listen to the numbers you were saying in the video, but remembered the receding hairline joke quite well. That is a far bigger proof that the guy in the video are you yourself. Then went to do the donation through the links without further lamenting on whatever. 
(I realised the "Dorian4" while copying donation address but I also did realise that it was only one character longer then the one I made myself in 20 minutes, so I guessed you had some little more time/better computer to run vanitygen. Also I thought the "4" is there by luck only.)
Also, I think we are mistaken that people would crosscheck addresses *internet-wide* and hence "Doria" and "Dorian" should have popped out. Both addresses would be fine in the eyes of a newbie. ... Hehe, but only if most other circumstantial evidences are fine and registered nicks on Tumbler would be given by the government and Reddit wasn't this very fast finding errors in live social engineering experiments.

I've first noticed Bitcoin when it was around $7. wanted to buy, but (un)fortunately I was super busy in my job, and did not have the way to purchase any from a little Eastern European country back then.

@_date: 2014-03-16 09:03:58
Hmm. You said a lot. But this is Sunday, I'm in the mood too. :)
My life is easy with Bitcoin, because:
1. Marketing is power, yes. I live off marketing as a pro. I tried doing something for an altcoin, but it IS struggling *to actually start* a new community.
2. If you let yourself grasp the idea of Shrem being an *agent* (from whichever agency wanting to bring Bitcoin down) you may understand his intentions/actions better. Same goes for TwoBitIdiot. Karpeles maybe just a simple idiot on his own. Do not rain me with downvotes, I am an independent thinker considering *any* possibility.
3. People keeping their money on Gox. Bad, true. But I sometimes think those are the people that made LOT of *wealth* by buying in early ($0-$15) and stating to be rich when it was $1241. Not saying everybody was like this, but I want to hear from them the true story.
4. Hacker has Gox coins? I do not believe. TM could not be the issue behind. Maybe an agency (see above) took hold of the coins.
5. "... it deserves to be dethroned due to so many bad actors and BS" Yeah, this is why I think agencies may be involved.
All in all: do not be depressed about Bitcoin, think about Andreas and some other people, they should cheer up your day. The mentality of the community is going to go down as the commnutity widens into new segments of the population. Occasionally the *community* will be gone and there will be everybody just using Bitcoin. (I know it is impossible).
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:07:53

Uhh, I just searched for all these three, my results are very very poor. As poor as the query itself actually. They most probably have their "raw search" method saved for these cases. I usually run into queries where results are just really unrelated while query is meaningful.
I guess the "new site" issue is solved by the users who tend to spend lot of efforts to do searches after searches for a particular topic and once they abandon re-searching Google remembers their click choices and learns. Hell, probably there is no difference between "new" sites and "old" sites only how many times a given result was clicked by users not returning to refined searches. And "stupid" searches have bad results as there was no time to build user behavior patterns. So (somewhat bad) guessing is left added with some word matching feature. 
Yes, making a search engine for the Storj Youtube is not an easy task that is clear. Regardless how it works. And I was daydreaming.

The author can send $1,000 WORTH of VALUE to "dozens of countries" for $8 with WU. But the receiver has to do fiat-fiat conversion. Factoid: **Most of the countries** DO NOT USE USD
Bitcoin will still send $1,000 to EVERY place on Earth (with internet -see remarks below...) for a max of $0.05 TX fee. And locally the receiver will have to do BTC-fiat conversion yes. Need to check, but I am not really sure which scenario wins.

@_date: 2014-03-27 15:14:22
We are in a very different situation already now. Very MUCH different. 
Then it was all about many people wanted to "touch" bitcoin hence driving up the price. (And I am not even using the word bubble for the case.)
Now it is more an *established* thing, those people came and gone. Many good news out there, but bad ones also. Bitcoin is now gaining traction, but it does not necessarily imply that the unit price has to go up. Sort of like Facebook share price if you remember. It needed some longer time to go back to the IPO rate.
Bitcoin is now a *business* you know. And it has to prove itself valuable. And that is not an easy task.
So yes, there were time btc went upward, but that has ended. We are playing a completely different game now.
That everybody must realistically see.
And I do believe in Bitcoin. Let me have my own opinion about it.

Interesting. Somewhat similar understanding at the start. But then it turns to be very different


My service could do this (using above text replaced with new elements):
*XYZ* aims to ~~do all that research and just~~ tell you which one or two items are the "best" for the ~~majority of the people~~ *for you*, ~~the majority of the time~~ *for the given situation you are having*, for any particular category.
These guys are doing the kind of simple thing that magazines have been doing for long time when printed media was profitable.
I am from sales and marketing and do know that every product that gets purchased has a potential to make the user happy with the product. Regardless of the product itself. If you happen to be able to spend time researching and you are good at it, you might end up being a happy customer. If you are unable to search for any reason you will be more likely to be an unhappy customer. 
So helping customers to choose products they would be happy with could be a big thing potentially.

Now only (s)he had some great tits and nice hair too! MSM would die to put him/her on screen. ...  :)

Inherent with the lifespan of man. Actually I do not believe in life extension. I mean I don't think people will want it. Or can afford it.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:13:03


Thanks, I really wanted to hear at least one number from one miner! $103 is a little bit further away.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:04:33
So he believes "status quo will remain", but at the same time "If Kevin Roose believed that bitcoin was dying".... oooo. is it going to be status quo then (bitcoin not disturbing it hence dying) or he does not believe in a dying bitcoin?
Or are you accusing this little baby bitcoin not taking Visa's position *as of this weekend*?
Or am I confused in my confusion?
(I understand both of your words, just trying to make a point here.)
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:57:25
Guys, he is not asking for "you should/shouldn't have done" help I guess.
Be serious on this, like being face to face with him.
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:11:34
...and honestly asking this in r/bitcoin... :)

You can do Chinese subtitle.

@_date: 2014-03-09 20:49:22
OMG. No.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:54:16
I for one actually can imagine this to be true. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 12:10:07
I have to do this, sorry:
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:42:43
I love the ones with the circuit theme.
Favorite is the circuit key.

He said coins are stolen, but many Blockchain Forensics Agents working hard on the issue saying they are not.

Heated discussion this thread: 
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:49:59
"When the facts change, I change my mind" He tweeted. So, not only bashing happened.
@_date: 2014-05-23 08:40:14
Wise and wise of pwice.
@_date: 2014-03-05 07:12:50
We all need to do this. Always... Every. Single. Time. This. Happens.
I am actually thinking to put up a bounty (very small, but people may join) for journalist correction submissions. Or "synagogue president" correction submissions.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:24:22
I am concerned as switching off miners will lead to a compromised network pretty easy.
And even the fear of that would just mean the **END** very quickly.
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:07:46
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:31:30
Truly from my heart man! Every single word of it. Thanks for sharing the docu. That thing is the thing I claimed must have been existed although with no proof.
You will be the first who I actually memorize your nick on this sub.
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:54:27
It's actually a trendline over 5 months of trading.
The only relevant trendline I can think of basically.
@_date: 2014-03-28 09:34:07


Source? If I might ask.
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:45:05


Hmmm, do you maybe have a link? Or some depicting (unique) word from the article that I can use for search for it?
Anyway, I do think I can solve the issue of keeping it unbiased. It is not an easy issue, but once you set some rules like **not** to accept associate links or any money from companies, then you are on track basically. Think of reddit, wikipedia and so on. 
Not surprisingly in its latest iteration it also uses BTC through some sort of changetip solution built into it.
@_date: 2014-03-28 09:36:30


Love this.

I know it's German. I do not know German.

This is great news... :)
But put ELDERLY into your text and even more people will click to see this post.

We are all fucked that is clear I guess.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:01:01
Yeah, no exceptions, it's clear as the sun. 
Fuck Karpeles, put him in jail or grave, sorry to the one who lost money, and long live Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-03-15 08:53:15
1 bitcoin is valued at ~~$632,77~~ **EXACTLY** at this moment. It is the consensus of those hundreds of thousand of people do understand how to value.
Edit: it's now $630.86. (Those bloody people are still discussing, or what the hell?)
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:50:23
Bias should not be normal.
@_date: 2014-04-23 12:13:33
This is Bitcoin-land. Go check yourself.
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:46:17
I can make 1 BTC out of $300 through scrypt mining. So I am good for maybe the next two more weeks. Then I sell my ordinary PC equipment (although at discounted price).

Seems like he was kicked in the ass to act like a grown-up. At least he said meaningful words again and did not miss his name being put there.
Probably from his lawyer this morning.
Of course still bullshitting around. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 06:37:48
Yeah, and actually no offense intended to GT as it does a certain job well, and if you understand its way of working you can actually use it to improve your language skills.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:30:24


Yes, I am thinking that mining will be seriously centralised very very soon if price continues to fall.
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:59:47
"and they probably help reduce volatility in the long run" might not be true. Traders need volatility. You just said that. If they eventually smooth out volatility they will be gone. So their intent is to ride (and keep) volatility.
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:56:56
Yeah, but I am pretty sure the guy with the "largest miner farm in North America" can not afford to hold and pay the utility company (even for warehouse renting...) after a certain price level is reached down the road and some time is spent *holding*.
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:12:52
And what happens if you pay for server time or even your employee in Bitcoin? How do you manage THAT when declaration comes? Essentially you used a Non-EUR currency to complete some business. How do you translate THAT into EUR results?
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:14:02
But in the other dimension it takes much longer (let say elevators are not to be used!)
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:48:11
I feel kind of *busy* down here already.
What happens if we will be 20 billions together? Will be hell of a party!
@_date: 2014-04-20 07:12:29
I am almost getting excited with the recent prices. Now we need only two more weeks.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:58:11
Oh my God, they actually didn't use the template they were given themselves! 
There must be some serious work going on there!
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:06:26
I object this.
We are here, yes.
