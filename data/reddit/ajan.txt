Used Jaxx for ethereum. Saved the private key it gave me. Windows corrupted, reset windows. Lost all my ethereum, when trying to recover my ether wallet. I guess pretty safe.

That's why its best to have a cold wallet, by which you dump about 90% of your btc amount in. And leave the remaining 10% as spending cash. Well this works for me atm as I only spend a few bucks a month on online shops. Only problem currently, is that shops aren't willing to take bitcoins in my part of the world yet, even though our currency is on the verge of junk status.

What exactly does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-03-06 20:51:17
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:34:40
Coinbase is just an exchange, it is directly affected by how well bitcoin is doing.
Just for interest sake, do you support blockstream?
@_date: 2016-01-08 23:31:44
Pretty sure Xapo was before this. So first should be removed.

I'm confused, aren't these liberals crying that Trump are taking away their free speech and their rights? Yet they are doing exactly what Trump is doing.

This might be off topic. Is 21.co a social experiment of some sort? I got that feeling when first trying it out. Am I not seeing the full picture?
@_date: 2017-01-23 09:54:20
Nigeria and SA have a choice between luno and localbitcoins. I think most other countries have a good localbitcoins exchange. Exchange rates are really shit. Getting an hardware wallet is somewhat expensive as well.

how so? Too many risks for a few benefits. Do you even know what they are?

What innovations have they made over the past year?

Custom coded by the university. Unless they leak it, we should be fine for now. Considering that the idea is out now, people will be making their own
@_date: 2016-12-09 08:11:55
Those 2 things will make bitcoin even more immature. Those aren't the solutions needed and neither is a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-12-05 11:27:08
Yea but then the issue would be, why must you waste your time on something that shouldn't have occurred in the first place.

Some merchants aren't up to date with visa's software. This program uses the outdated merchants where the system doesn't ask for OTP as it's checks. Really stupid of visa to not force merchants to be up to date in terms of software.

So until that point, its just wasted code needed to make steam even more bloated?
@_date: 2016-02-25 12:10:36
Yip, but most people would come to this subreddit to advertise. It's one of the many the reason why this subreddit has degraded so much.

One of the main benefits of bitcoin is it's lower fees. Core/lightning supporters will never agree with this.
@_date: 2016-02-09 17:22:04
Yes, it just some more code to bloat the steam app up a bit.
@_date: 2016-02-28 10:46:40
I sort of did it this way last night, on three different flash drives. None of the keys/passwords are online for me, and all three are stored in three different fireproof safes.
I also added another AES-512 encrypt on the data file with a 30 char password, as well as encrypting the text with another AES-512 with a 15 char password. I used Veracrypt's hidden partition to store the files on the drives, which to normal people will make it look like the flash's storage is corrupt. All in all, that's 4 layers of AES-512 encryptions plus a safe you have to break into.
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:28:03
Higher fees will destroy bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:05:27
Nice scam attempt.

Why are you on asking that question? Implying steam actually cares if you lose your virtual pixel skins/accessories. 
They know their users are idiots - currently they aren't willing to refund or negate any loss that you have been caused with a centralized payment system, nothing will change with bitcoin.

Some countries have it bad

I found this strange, satoshi's paper stated bitcoin is to remain decentralised. And now this satoshi wants to centralise it.
Oh wait, he isn't the creator.

You've lost the way brother. Need not to worry, it's not to late to get the correct information.

You realise PoW change, temporally cripples ASICs. GPU miners will take over for about a month or two. The objective of the change is to make sure a new hash can make ASICs easy to produce and manufacture whilst competing among'st other competitor brands. That not only bitmain can produce the most efficient. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:20:22
lol? Have you seen EC side? Without bitmain ABC chain split will be dead in the water. There's tons of pools that will support the UASF chain. Where as only 3 pools will support ABC, thats what you get for supporting centralised mining.
@_date: 2017-07-01 12:17:43
He isn't wrong. Bitcoin.com is the buzzfeed of crypto. Pushing alternative agendas.

I fucking love that argument: If internet falls then bitcoin is screwed.
The same exact thing can be said about fiat/banking. Almost everyone transacts online now a days. It's in everyone's best interest to keep the internet going.

Check in your boot management settings on Android. All the Android 6 phones have it on by default I think, some phones might not.

Business people aren't even in bitcoin yet. What you think are business people are merely just small time capital investors, they can be easily replaced by the next lot of get richer schemers. Now piss off to @_date: 2017-06-24 14:31:03
WTF how? I am satoshi
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:26:20
Not really, the code is just code. It isn't deployed. None of the bug reports will affect the price until 21st.
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:06:01
Not when competing builds release closed-source patches. That is something that will kill bitcoin.

Good write up, but needed to add the spice of ASIC boost. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:19:34
As a side note. What do you think about the price before and after the 1st? Will it cause a panic sell which will crash the market?
