That's exactly what it is, And the ones at the top of the pyramid (early adopters and business startups) will be the only ones to benefit from it.
After they have decided to cash in the bitcoins for USD the pyramid collapses and everyone else is stuck holding worthless bitcoins that can't even be redeemed for monkey shit.

We will be free of it when resources are the common heritage of mankind and not "Goods".

I think it would be easier to just pay people in butts.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:06:17
Some of it is, But some of it is also the original miners and business startups, The key thing to look at though is the balance of those addresses, You can see where all the BTC is concentrated.

They are still hoarding, They might spend a little here and there but they are sitting on most of it.

But bitcoin is directly tied to fiat, Bitcoin by itself has no value, It's value is in exchange for fiat, Most people that accept bitcoin list their goods or services priced in USD and simply offer to accept the equivilent in bitcoin.
Not that i'm praising an obviously flawed system like fiat money but just pointing out the obvious here.
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:10:02
It would be much easier to accept butts as payment for goods and services.

Because of laws that are put in place to ensure he can no longer make his own swords or perhaps market monopolization from monolithic corporations similar to what happened to millions of small businesses when walmart came along.


Some argue the system we are currently under is not pure free market capitalism as was originally intended, I would say our system is a hybrid socialist/capitalist system, I don't think capitalism could survive on it's own without socialist programs such as welfare, It actually collapsed back in 1929.
I don't advocate socialism or capitalism or communism, I think monetary based systems are primitive and are holding us back as a species, They benefitted us for a while but now that we have the technology to fully automate all manual labor there really is no need for jobs or money anymore, We need intelligent management and distribution of resources so we don't all starve to death, When production costs are $0 there will be no need to buy or sell anything.

Yes it is slavery, The fruits of your labor is worth more than a wage, A wage is something you are forced to accept when you cannot own the fruits of your labor.

"Ok sir, That will be 1.22btc ... no 0.95btc ....no 2.34btc ... damn it the price keeps changing, Fuck it just pay me in dollars."
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:18:31
Without dollars you wouldn't have any idea what gold and silver would be worth, Let's face it if something big happens like an economic collapse that sends us back to trading metals and bartering then we are straight fucked, Most people don't have any metals anyway so right off the bat everyone would be poor.

You lost money. $135 is a good time to dump.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:54:39
There is intrinsic value of the FRUITS of ones labor, When you work at a job for a wage you do not own the fruits of your labor, The fruits of your labor belong to your employer.
You are forced to accept wage labor because you cannot produce the goods yourself.

1% of the Bitcoin community do, The original miners already have most of it, The common man can't buy much bitcoin now too expensive.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:55:30
If you go by the weighted average you could lose money on a sale or overcharge for a sale, Just a few hours ago the weighted average was like $150 but bitcoin was trading at 120, If you charged your customer at that rate you would have ripped him off.
The difference between btc and USD is that USD isin't fucking jumping and falling in value every 5 seconds so its stable enough to use as a means of exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:16:15
The startups and the original miners will be the only ones profiting off bitcoin, Unless of course you are already rich and have a ton of cash to throw into bitcoin.
For the average person Bitcoin is already becoming unprofitable, When the ASIC hardware miners finally get to work mining will become impossible for anyone that isin't rich.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:29:19
Sounds like a good deal, Now you can pay more money to mine those buttcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-07 00:24:58
Bitcoin is not the savior you think it is, It's plagued with wealth hoarding early adopters and startups that are just sitting on their coins waiting to cash out and when they do it's gonna be pop goes the weasel.
Almost no one is using it as a means of exchange as it was intended, Instead people are using it as a speculative security investment.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:41:15
What i meant was the big players are not spending their Bitcoins, And the Bitcoins that are being spent at bitspend.net will be hoarded by those companies until they decided to cash them out.
The little fish are spending their bitcoins because they don't have many anyway.

It's called a "Dialect" The spanish and the Mexicans both speak the same language too but the Mexicans speak a different dialect of spanish, Just like jamaicans speak english too but just not the same way the Brits and the Americans speak it.

Ok let's say you are a blacksmith and you make swords and battle axes and you sell them for a living, Say i start a business and hire you to come work for me, I pay you a wage for your labor and your swords are now mine to sell in my storefront at a markup retail price, Now you work twice as hard and twice as long and make half as much while i (The capitalist) work maybe 2 hours make twice as much and do half the work.
If you had continued selling the swords yourself you wouldn't have to meet my production quota rules and work my absurd hours.
BYOB is freedom, Employment is subjugation.


Flase, did you know in most places it is illegal to sell vegitables you grew, The revenue enforcers shutdown lemonade stands now.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:42:42
$0 all signs are pointing to a massive bubble, People are mostly hoarding bitcoin and not spending any of it witch will inevitably render bitcoin useless as a means of exchange, Once the early miners and business ventures decide to cash out you better hope you packed a life preserver or you will be going down with the ship.
This Bitcoin is no "cyber christ" it' has all the same problems of every major currency system, Maybe there is no inflation but the wealth hoarding is certainly there, 1% of the population already own most of the bitcoin in circulation.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:41:46
lol, No it's not gold, Gold has uses other than being a form of money, Gold can be melted down and used in jewlery and other things, Bitcoin has no other use than being a medium of exchange and it's not even unique anymore with other crypto currencies based on it popping it.
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:58:01
If fiat currency where to collapse tomorrow what would bitcoin be worth? NOTHING, Why? Because they are not tangible! Bitcoin is only worth what they are redeemable for in fiat currency and nothing more.
The collapse of fiat currency would also be the collapse of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:25:02
It seems to me that the Bitcoin economy will suffer from the same problems the fiat economy suffers from, Eventually most of the wealth will end up concentrated in the hands of a few, In Bitcoin land the early adopters will end up on top while everyone else scrambles to invest what little they have, And while they might profit a little bit for a while eventually the price will level off and they will be just as poor in the Bitcoin system as they are in the fiat system.
Most of the Bitcoins will end up in the hands of early adopters and business ventures witch will only hoard them much the same way the 1% do with their money today, Most of the money stops circulating and ends up being stored in bank accounts or corporate investments that only benefit the 1% and the corporations no one else.

Buttcoin is a joke.
@_date: 2013-04-07 01:02:46
Some of those address might be exchanges but not all 410 of them, Maybe 10 or 20 at the most, The rest are the addresses of early adopters.
As dumps happen people will lose faith in Bitcoin, It's not money it's just some numbers in a piece of software that people are using fiat cash to gamble on.
Bitcoin is anything but stable.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:36:30
Yea, About the same time hell freezes over.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:56:30
It also allows extreme monopolization and subjugation and legalized slavery via wage labor.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:27:40
If i was an early adopter i would be ready to cash out here pretty soon, Wait for the price to stay level at 130 -140ish then start unloading.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:32:40
Bitcoin is being hoarded and not spent, Early adopters and business startups first to the table will be the only ones to profit from bitcoin, There is no circulation of the money anymore now that it's so valuable it will only continue to be hoarded more and more until it ceases to function as a viable means of exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:11:29
Actually the numbers speak for themselves.
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:23:47
It's hard to tell what the average weight of a butt is.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:28:05
I see Bitcoin turning out the same as fiat in the end, Eventually all of the Bitcoin wealth will end up in the hands of a few early adopters and corporations and everyone else will end up poor again, This is the nature of monetary based systems and why they must all be abolished if we are to ever be free.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:53:23
No i mean if fiat where to completely vanish tomorrow, Meaning no longer holding any value and no longer accepted anywhere as a means of exchange, With USD at a value of dog poop you could no longer determine the value of gold as a means of exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:17:29
Buttcoin. It's like gold but without the intrinsic value.
