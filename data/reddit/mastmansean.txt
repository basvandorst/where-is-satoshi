Integrity of the Bitcoin, 21 Million Cap, and wether or not the Fed can scare the holders out of their coin, are the top factors in Bitcoins Valuation.  Not to mention the concept of lost coins because of account passwords lost, or death of owners of wallets.  Also, the Satoshi Factor, known to be more than One Million Coins locked up some where in some wallet, sitting and waiting for that Most Desired Point, Dream, of, World Wide Acceptance, and Resilience against any government Authority Using coercive force to Scare People from adopting Bit Coin as the World Currency of choice, as far as Integrity, speed of transactions, and a few other accolades that bring Value to it by the People.
In this Light...News Releases of Stolen Coins Should have been expected....It is the obvious devaluing method anticipated.  There are others also, but this News is in line with what was expected.  If the premise of bitcoin is True, which in part found its beginnings from a paper on "b Money" then in theory it should be impossible to steal Bit Coin because the records should be self correcting and any stolen money will to resolve correctly with other records and thus be self identifying as to have been stolen in the first place.  This stolen Bitcoins will fall out of sync with The Current Records and thus not be recognized as true or real but coins, and be "Rejected" as such, and thus render to the Internet Wasteland, somewhere, and Unaccepted by the current blockchain Record.  All that will happen to anyone who wants to steal coin, if they can in the first place, is a guaranteed conviction of theft and punishment there of.  Thus integrity of Bitcoin is Strong and in Place, all dependendent on the validity of the model.
