Do paper wallets work for a wishing well?

Thats what I do, too. But since i'm quite unknown as a hobby beat maker, not a single mBTC was transferred yet. Too many limiting factors: People have to surf soundcloud, stumble upon my beats, like them and use bitcoins. That results in like 2 possible people worldwide ;)

With merchant adoption rising way faster than consumer adoption it will be a long road to rising bitcoin prices. Since I am a long term holder, I have to get used to the thought that maybe I am a -very- long term holder.

A paper wallet basically is a printed piece of paper with your public key and your private key on it. You can create a paper wallet on  and print it. Then you transfer your coins to it's public address.
If you don't like the design, you can also use custom designs like the one I posted over here

Bitcoin is quite a huge ecosystem (hate that word) with many companies, news portals, websites, subreddits, investors, traders and even artists and much more. Very much information to find out about.
I don't know why I should google 'Apple Pay' at all, and that's not because its easy (I have no clue about it), but because there isn't happening much around it.

You can develop things on a $40 Raspberry Pi loaded with $360 of Bitcoin, sure.

Bad advertising.
Its like saying "start listening music instantly with this new car". Totally misses the point.

It is. But it's not that simple. Simplicity wins, look at all the lazy people ditching an app because another app does the same with one click less.
Mining with this device isn't meant to be profitable, it just gives you some satoshis to play around with, without effort. Thats all you need to start.

@_date: 2015-09-22 09:14:12
I think you don't pay for the miner, but for the API. Mining is not the important part of that dev kit, it's just a very easy way to get some satoshis to play around with.

US officers seem to be a threat rather than a help, after all I've read and seen about stealing cash from random citizens and beating, tazing or even shooting people for silly reasons. Wtf?

Excellent marketing so far. I'm permanently thinking about that thing and what it may be capable of.
21 just planted a seed into our minds!

Haha, great idea :)

For a second I thought: 'Ah, I got it!', but now this thing leaves me clueless again.
Edit: Any developer here to point out the awesomeness of that little computer?

Not surprising - bitcoins are cheap nowadays and the potential profit is great. The same is true for a lottery ticket, but I think the chance to make profit with bitcoins is many times bigger than winning a lottery. Good luck, everyone!

Nice, that adds another line to the long list of great things about Sweden!

Well… maybe they use dollars.

If anyone suddenly found a 1000 tons gold nugget in his garden.
No wait, that was another story.

Negative interest plus inflation… what a great bundle :)

Never read CCN or Coindesk.
Besides, 'Bank CEO' is more like 'Candy Shop CEO', which is ok in my opinion.
'Money CEO' would have been an example like 'Bitcoin CEO'.

Last chance for cheap coins, you know. Like every time.

Sure, but have you ever read about sugar CEO, dollar CEO or car CEO?

I don't get how these cards have really nice artworks on the one hand and crappy text layouts on the other hand.

Mycelium on my android/cyanogen is allowed to use the camera for scanning QR codes, all other rights are blocked. Works 100%.

Probably not the best time to sell right now?
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:32:00
Well, some weeks ago was a better time to buy. But that shouldn't stop you from buying now.
