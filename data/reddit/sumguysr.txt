I think you missed the part where ordinary keys still work just the same.

Bull. Hospitals would be hectic and would run out of a few things for a while but they'd still work. Many government services would stop but the most essential ones would continue. Police, fire, and rescue would certainly have very little trouble. There are a few supply chains that can't function without networked automation but they're limited, most could be switched back to man power in a matter of days or a couple weeks at most. There'd be problems but few that people would be unable to cope with.
I've worked in government, believe me they are prepared to switch to an all paper workflow. It might make 'em more efficient even.

Is this still going?  Looks like a cool service.

I don't think you addressed the concern I presented at all, and no, I'm not envious, I'm concerned about the long term viability of bitcoin and curious.

But if it's very concentrated, say with the vast majority owned by just a couple hundred people or less, aren't those people then setting the exchange rate, and can't the whole system be considered equivalent to a ponzi scheme?

And, a problem that's only substantial for big bitcoin users should be considered very substantial in the Bitcoin Subreddit!

If one had substantial wealth in the form of bitcoins I think that'd be a substantial problem.

Because if the bulk of bitcoins are held by a small group of individuals then don't those individuals have control of the exchange rate? And if that's so, could they not, might they not currently be, using the network as a very large very complex ponzi scheme? Maybe that could even happen without intentional manipulation.

Being an early and effective miner and being bitcoin millionaire would be just as good.
