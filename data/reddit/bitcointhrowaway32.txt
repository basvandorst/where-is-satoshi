I am entitled to work in a pain free environment, yes. Are you an NSA shill?

You're missing the point, my family will be living on a yacht in a few years. Where will yours be? Still living the 9-5 middle class life?

It's a small town, there was no camera unfortunately.

Actually I have some DOGE miners running at home and quite a few thousand DOGE too. I can't wait for this to get a larger market cap.

One day I'll be your boss after I buy out your company when Bitcoin reaches $100,000 and you'll regret saying archaic things like this. Get with the modern age you dinosaur.

Like I said, I'm going through rough times right now and we specifically picked this place because it accepted Bitcoin. Otherwise we would have just ate at Burger King like we originally were planning to.

How rude.
Some people are just going through temporary issues and will be off welfare soon enough. I'm not like one of those people who live on welfare their entire life. If my doctor would just prescribe me what I asked for my back pain then I'd probably be back to work but he seems to think I'm faking this pain or something and I think he's managed to talk to other doctors in the small town I live in because they won't give me the meds either.
Also, I pay taxes so I have a right to use it.

I thought about naming the restaurant but there was a police report filed which would make it pretty easy for someone to dox me.

Hey, my back still hurts, so it's a legitimate issue. If the government wants to stop paying me to sit at home then they can fork up the meds I deserve.
