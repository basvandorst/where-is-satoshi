Thanks for the reply. Don't we need to "sell" the idea of bitcoin though for there to be incentive to put the infrastructure in its place? I know sell isn't the right word but it kind of works in this context. I mean people have to believe in bitcoin's value for someone to invent a bitcoin ATM, right?
So in the beginning stages we are in right now, we do need to convince people of its value for there to be incentive to build infrastructure?

Well if you read what I wrote you'd know that I do think it will be worth well over 800 again. The reason I sold at 900 was because I have a limited amount of money to put into this and I'm using that money from selling to buy at a lower price and hold.

I really am not looking for short term gains, I just realized that it was bound to normalize, and I was looking to re-adjust the price that I had originally bought in at because it was just too high. I don't think I'd ever really try my hand at day-trading because I would lose thousands. Even if it drops far below what I just bought at, I'm content because I know eventually it will be back above.

Don't worry guys, I did the same thing during Thanksgiving. Bought in at around $1,100. That weekend I saw the price drop to $800 and was kicking myself. Sold at $900 for a loss today, but then bought a bunch back at $650. There is still hope for you guys too.

I dont have extra money to put in every week so I sold at 900 to put all the money from that sell back into bitcoin at 650, which I did. From here on out I'm holding. In the end I will have gained money from this move.

Well I am certainly taking note of that. I can't imagine holding at times like these when people have bought in at less that $100. And I don't mean that as in its stupid to hold, just how much of a mental challenge it has to be. I'm hoping I can curb my enthusiasm if it does start to reach 2x, 3x times more than what I bought at, because large sums of money really start to fuck with your head.
