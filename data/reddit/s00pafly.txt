This was always the case. The questions on hand are actually how valuable blockspace is and how much blockspace the off chain solutions need.
Blockspace is more expensive the more nodes are running and keep a copy of the blockchain. This means more decentralized coins will generally require higher fees. The second question can only be answered after implementing second layer protocols.

Just tip DOGE

If Ken M was mining bitcoins.

Well it worked.

Very nice. Good Job.

is this the least shady wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:51:42
Not quite out of thin air. Jihan and the poor souls over at r/btc kindly offered them to you.
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:54:55
There is no info on there. This is just an ad.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:04:25
Price went up.
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:27:23
Problem is the period it takes for the difficulty to adjust. 2016 blocks could take up to 140 days.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:21:05
It'll be interesting when bitcoin difficulty adjusts again in 2 weeks. Making bitcoin mining around 30% more profitable. This means EDA will have to drop difficulty even 30% lower than now to reach profit parity. So when the hashrate switches back to the altcoin after the EDA, blocks will be mined even faster. We might be seeing block generation rates up to 100 blocks/hour. This will lead to inflation and price drop which in turn will result in the EDA having to drop difficulty even lower to reach profitability. Rinse and repeat.

Apparently nobody cares enough.

No a block is more like a container where the transactions are stored inside. When you find a new block by guessing the right answer to a math problem, you can put as many transactions in it until it's full. You then connect it to the previous found block, linking it into the blockchain. Transactions inside a block count as confirmed and are irreversible. By finding a block you will recieve a block reward from the network, currently 12.5 BTC as well as all the fees from the transactions included in the block.
As the post above already mentioned, the solution to the math problem is incredibly hard to find. So people band together in pools to work together and increase their chance of finding a block. The reward is then split according to the work each person contributed.

If your second transaction goes through before the first (hence the higher fee), the first one will be rejected. Thats the whole point though.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:55:51
If you held bitcoins before the fork you already have the same amount of bcash. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:30:52
You are the 0.0000000056%.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:29:59
Craft another transaction to yourself from the same inputs with a higher fee to create a double spend and make the initial transaction invalid.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:36:36
No way.
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:22:05
But as a result of lower and lower diffictulty blocks will be mined at a much faster rate. Last cycle we had around 30 blocks per hour. Next cycle I expect an even higher rate. At some point these coins will reach the market, leading to price drop and even lower difficulty to achieve profitability. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:40:23
So are you saying its a good thing that nobody uses it?
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:03:28
Yeah about that... Lightning might wanna have a word with you.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:04:03
Because the other coins blocks contain around 15 transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:33:32
Thats because bch mines around 3 blocks per hour atm.

While not necessary, there's a user script [ImportJSON]( that makes working with API calls a little easier.
And if you'd like to update your data you can use something like this
    CONCATENATE("url.com","?", MINUTE(NOW)) 
so google can't cache the url. This would update every minute. Or you can add a checkbox and use it's value to update the call.

If they're the majority chain wouldn't all the numerous supporters upgrade their wallets anyway?
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:00:37
Yes, but nobody does it out of good will.
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:40:08
No way!

As of now $9401. 15K moon confirmed you heard it here first.

For them they'd move at normal pace. But if you were to observe them through a telescope from earth, they'd appear standing still since they're moving so slowly from your point of view.
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:23:31
Just... just stop please.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:15:58
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:52:43
Hmm. Maybe you have to have Coin control features enabled. Under settings, wallet. If this doesn't work then I'm also out of ideas.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:10:28
Click on the transaction itself.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:44:02
Right click in the transactions tab. Abandon Transaction.

If you sell them already it's not hard to accept bitcoins as well. Just go for it. I'm sure people are happy to buy ghost chillis with BTC.
Edit: After visiting your site, i'd advise you to set up a proper web shop. This doesn't take long and there are already solutions out there. This blog site layout just doesn't look very inviting to me.

You'd need to set up a webserver that supports php. This is not really practical. Better look out for some free php hosting. Put the file up there and enjoy your personal web ticker.
