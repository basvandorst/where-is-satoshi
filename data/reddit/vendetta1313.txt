You could solve a block on your first share. It could also take you hundreds of billions of years to reach the solution. Mining in a pool really is the best choice for payment stability. Even those with giant hashrates such as ASICminer are opting to work in a pool, in order to mitigate risk and maximize return for every share that is solved.

The site is probably using a program that uses IP address information to create geographical coordinates that can then be plotted on the globe. Based on the position of the "activity" it would appear that the geographical point is roughly the exact center of Russia. In all likelihood, the program is getting confused by IP address information that can't be resolved, but it knows it's coming out of Russia so it puts all of the unresolved activity on the globe at one point - the exact center of Russia. I've seen this sort of activity in other programs, where you'll see a huge distribution of activity in the United States in the region of Lebanon, Kansas which is the geographical center of the US.

Would it be possible with a block generation rate of 1 per 20 minutes though (even if that's unacceptable as a currency)? Suppose there were nodes and miners on Mars, the network would simply be unable to sync sufficiently quickly over the large distances?

Very limited amount of the series 1 coins were ever made. Image if you had one of the first ever gold coins minted by the USA, it would be worth much more than its face value.

[Here]( are a lot of technical FAQs from blockchain.info themselves, if you haven't seen that section before. Good luck!
