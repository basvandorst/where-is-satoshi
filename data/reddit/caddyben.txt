I as well use coinbase, but wonder how secure it will be in the future as bitcoin becomes more sought after. How trustworthy is the company?

I never understood how btc atm's are "convenient" when everything can be done on a smartphone that they probably already own.

85% of them will have been generated this year.
It is more probable to think that the world adopts a mainstream currency in the next 80 years, so owning bitcoin (in any amount) is buying into that idea. Could be bitcoin, might be something else. Early adopters will have a stake in all of it.
You dont buy a bitcoin and think youll be rich in 100 years. You buy bitcoin and hope that mankind has a serious facelift while you continue to hold or use it.
We are definitely in the tech's infancy, and I do believe bitcoin isn't the end all denomination, but I do think it will play a part in the movement and is very undervalued right now.

If there are only ever going to be 50 pieces of the world's tastiest pie and 35 of them have already been served, those last 15 pieces, in theory, would be in significantly higher demand than the first few pieces, driving the price up substantially.
As we move farther along into bitcoin's  career, it will be harder and harder to "create" more of these btc, slowly working itself to a stop in 2100. And that will be it. All of the bitcoin that will ever be a thing, are a thing.
If bitcoin were to ever gain mainstream adaptation in this time, there wouldn't be enough of them going around for most people to even own a single one.
Supply &lt; Demand
If you own 12 whole btc in the year 2100, you would theoretically be a 1%er. That's Trump money.

Obviously. But that is why it can be discussed as a potential store of wealth. 
I used the pie analogy not to imply that we will consume it, but to demonstrate  that there is a predetermined finite amount.
