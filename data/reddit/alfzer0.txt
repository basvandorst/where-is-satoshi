If you do care to learn how to secure your bitcoin well and feel comfortable about it, you can try out the methods people are mentioning, but only transfer a small amount from Coinbase into your new wallet.  And after it's there, go ahead and create another wallet and learn how to send between wallets.  Make a paper wallet, send em there, and then learn how to sweep it into a software wallet. Etc.  After enough practice and coming up with a plan on how to keep the wallets and passphrases physically secure and backed up in multiple places, you should be comfortable with taking on the burden of holding the keys to your bitcoin.  Although, as you can imagine, to do this well does take quite some learning, planning, and practice...as well as the desire to do so.

Because you have in more than you can afford to lose, and the increased uncertainty of its regulatory/legal status and change to the method of fiat exchange terrifies you.

The better idea is to roll it over to a self directed Roth IRA LLC and put a portion of it in crypto.
