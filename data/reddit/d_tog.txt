Cool. Looks like they have realised they have an image problem. ��
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:09:43
Lol to this ☝️. �� 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:13:59
It was a Twitter PR director I think. Going to try and tackle Coinbase's image. ��

What was the reply?
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:11:43
Sunstroke for me. Long version. ��

This guy Bitcoins

I'm an ex programmer and I'm used to dealing with big numbers and growing databases. This is on a completely different scale. You can't plan for this. 300k new users in a weekend and $4k growth in an hour. It's insane.
It would break any system. For any of the exchanges to be remotely working through all this is a minor miracle of programming. Hats off to them. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:51:19
Good on you dude. Spend your money. No point having the most Bitcoin in the grave yard. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:37:30
The more I read about this the less I believe it. He definitely knew the price of Bitcoin. He was a miner.
To have a single backup is not what IT people do.
I know who he is. He lives near me and the landfill (tip) is 1/2 a mile from my house. I've taken photographs of it with the drones for the council and it's colossal. There's no way he's digging it up. It's all about earning  money from interviews on the back of the Bitcoin hype. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:14:58
Awesome. Nice to have some play money to experiment with. ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:22:43
That's exactly when I got in. I though 'a well. That's the end of that!'�� 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:40:20
Or everyone is skint and are taking money out for Xmas. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:04:07
Hi. I wouldn't be able to send them to you but if you ask Newport Council for them they might release them.
If you wanted me to take some more though I'm sure I could help you out. Google Aerial Photography Wales and you'll find me. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:24:57
HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:48:56
Boom. ��
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:47:47
It's literally 1/2 mile from my house. I drive past it a few times a week and never pass without a thought to the buries treasure. ��
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:21:07
Doesn't work
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:06:03
I know your shop. Awesome news. ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:14:16
No that's why it's important to review it twice a year with my financial advisor. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:32:20
It's not entirely fair to say it's going to devalue though. My UK pension is earning 9% at the moment so way out performing inflation.
@_date: 2019-11-09 11:21:17
I’ve installed a complication on my watch so now I’m even checking it when I don’t want to check it. ��

Good morning Vietnam..............I mean Bitcoin.

Sorry I didn’t realise the humour police were watching. Man you must be a barrel of laughs at parties. ��
@_date: 2019-10-22 07:21:32
Just realised what your username is. That is the funniest thing I have ever read. ��
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:41:12
Why is it ‘supposed to be’?
@_date: 2019-10-27 12:46:28
How does he know he has Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-12 17:03:20
Because it’s the weekend.
@_date: 2019-10-27 12:49:51
‘How much Bitcoin do you have?’
@_date: 2019-06-02 09:00:51
Fancy posting a screenshot? Just started learning TA and would love to see what you're thinking. ��
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:35:02

Past weekend performance have no bearing on future weekendness.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:43:44
The landfill or 'tip' is 5 minutes from my house in Newport. Do you think he's watching the price rise. ��
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:51:50
That landfill is a mile from my house. I've photographed it with the drones for a client. Didn't see $62m lying around though. ��
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:45:40
Zoom out.
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:57:27
You tell us!
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:16:27
God yeah. It's under 50ft of waste now. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:29:11
I don't know

Yeeeees!!!! ❤️

Low dynamic range cameras. HDR will be here soon though. ��

Gt3 = fast but ugly Beetle. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:32:28
I don't understand the 'force out the weak hands' thinking. Yes I know we should all be in this for the 'technology' but why does anyone want less people using Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:33:02
When education? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:28:20
Exactly. If we had 100x more people using it but they were all 'weak hands' would we really care? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:55:06
Stop being so serious man. Burglars around here like TVs and haven't heard of Bitcoin. ��
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:55:09
Cameras can usually capture 7 stops. Slightly more in a log profile but HDR will be 15. It's amazing. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:09:06
Well said actually. Yes totally get that. ��
I do try and educate the week hands. I'm in a group of very amateur invester friends. Its so hard to get them to HODL through the dips though. �� 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:44:45
Lol. Holy shit. ��

Meh. I'll get a pink Lambo. ��
