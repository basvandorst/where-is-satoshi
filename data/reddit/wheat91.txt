today I learned that TVs are older than napster and AIM, and more 'over' than cassette tapes and pac-man.
Also how is AIM, a service that is literally discontinued/over so solidly on the "hip" side?
Neat graph though!

A stock index is an ETH whose funds are based on the stocks that the fund owns, but the actual stocks are held by the fund itself not by the individuals who own shares in the fund. Again, owning part of an index fund does not grant you any of the rights or the ownership slips of an actual stock owner. You can't just put money into a total market index and show up to any company's meetings.

I don't think that's actually true. You can go into agreements with companies for portions of a stock and they will treat you as if you have the ability to sell it, get dividends etc., but I believe technically the stock can only be held by a single person and if you "own" a fraction of a stock from another company the issuing company wouldn't give you a certificate slip or any recognition as a partial owner of the company at a meeting etc. You are basically just relying on the stockspliting company to treat you as if you have that portion of a stock. One of the reasons that companies don't subdivide any further can be to do this: they don't want casual spectators to buy a cheap stock and have influence in terms of driving its price fluctuations or having membership powers.

Not identity theft if they are doing it under their own identity.

Zimbabwe uses American dollars as its currency... so yes.

That has to do with relative deflation of goods due to lack of physical currency being available; they are still u.s. dollars that would be worth the same if they were used elsewhere. Bitcoin and other currencies are similarly inflated there... it's really just lack of reliable currency causing devaluing of goods.

They do use physical U.S. dollars but have been increasingly relying on self-printed banknotes pegged to the dollar ("bollars"), but regardless all the of the electronically stored money and the money used by the government is u.s. dollars.

That is a far better origin than I could have hoped for. Thanks intrepid historian.
