The article is talking about the amount of money, not percentage. And yes, that's a really stupid way to measure a loss in a market

Yeah, that's true. But if you bought at the peak, it may take multiple years for it to even come close to that value again.

The problem with these memes is that the market is so volatile that you get memes on both sides at the same time.
I love it! XD

Lol XD I've been doing the same thing on another thread.

Yeah, if you bought it like that, then I agree. But looking at how some people are posting, it seems like they put way more than they can afford to lose it.

Yeah, this is something that really pisses me off about bitcoin... All of these people claiming that the news is misleading, whilst they in turn try to mislead people.
