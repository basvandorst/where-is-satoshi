Scale 50% in rn and leave the other 50% for buying dips.

Yep I got the same message but instead of giving him my email I simply requested that he upload the document to Google drive and then give me a share link.
Gotta help anyone pushing for adoption :)

You missed a zero. It comes out to 15M/lifetime

The stocks I agree with, but the bitcoin not so much. If you started mining up as much bitcoin as possible as soon as it was possible then you'd be taking away from the bitcoins from several people who would other have those BTC. These could be people who helped to get the project on it's feet. Considering that Satoshi mined the first million BTC I'd say if you took anything less than that you'd be fine. At today's prices tho you'd only need 180,000 ish BTC for a 100 lifetimes.

Well you can't say for sure but if I did get the chance to go back I wouldn't wanna screw it up by getting greedy lool. Mine some btc and wait till 2017, sell, call it a life.

I wonder which bull cycle he decided to end it all.

Lool same. Literally everyone flames you for being into Crypto. You said your average buy-in is at $7200 rn. You're sitting on 10% gains why even stress. Let em laugh and wait for the inevitable (and oh so sweet) "I told you so."

I dont think so, stocks are actually backed by a company. For example it doesn't matter who bought Amazon stock in 2005, they company would have done the same things regardless of if person X bought the stock over person Y. The only argument I could make is if you owned enough stock to attend board meetings and started screwing with company decisions.

FTX is currently my most used exchange right now (they also recently announced a partnership with Binance so they're definitely legit) a lot of really innovative and useful products. Gonna drop a ref link &gt;

5,000,000 * 10 = 50,000,000.
