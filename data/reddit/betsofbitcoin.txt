Hi. Welcome to the site.
I guess the subreddit is open to anyone. I would say feel free to start a discussion if you wish. 
@_date: 2012-07-07 03:19:42
Wow! This means that [bet on our site]( is not the biggest bet out there.
@_date: 2012-07-06 12:23:01
I certainly understand and respect that anonymous operation raises concerns but that is the only way we can do this right now. My only objection was on being classified as ponzi which simply means paying new users money to old users, something we clearly don't do. I am a betting judge, I am obsessed with definitions ;) Cheers!

We are redditors as well and here to answer any questions you might have about the site.

Bets of Bitcoin admin here. I can answer any question about the site.
@_date: 2012-06-09 03:34:40
I wouldn't say so. 
@_date: 2012-08-17 01:43:25
I've just approved the bet.
@_date: 2012-07-07 16:25:28
Yes you don't know your exact returns at the time of betting but I don't think that this is inherently unattractive (people put money in stock market all the time) nor it makes your bet unprofitable (every winning bet gets more than what you put). If you value certainty you can wait until close to the deadline, but our time weighted system awards early bettors more as they set the odds for late bets. 
@_date: 2012-07-05 22:52:38
It is nice to see our users here at reddit. Though I must disagree on one point, that we could be a ponzi. In any definition I know of, ponzi schemes require constant influx of new users and funds, whereas a betting site can function indefinitely with constant number of users and small influx of funds that would cover our share (%5 of losing bets). So I wouldn't say that we are a ponzi or "pays out only a tiny fraction of the bitcoins it holds".
@_date: 2012-07-05 21:23:06
The public bet on the default of this fund has just passed 635 bitcoins!

I did my best for ELI5:
What do you think?
@_date: 2012-09-10 23:43:23
We always cancel the bets after resolution.

Thanks for the mention. We are redditors as well and here to answer any questions you might have.

On a second look they might be trying to trend "Troptions" whatever that is.
Edit: I've just filed another report to Twitter.

I reported similar spamming to Twitter long time ago. They used to contain links. I think these ones are just trying to make bitcoin "trending". So annoying.
@_date: 2012-08-29 14:50:25
We are thrilled to see the enthusiasm of our users. Thank you!

[Bets of Bitcoin]( admin here.
As far as we know there is no prosecution so far against the users of any gambling site in the US. We generate a unique private deposit address for each user, so it is extremely unlikely to be traceable. If you do the same for withdrawals you should be very safe. If you are concerned that your internet service provider is eavesdropping on you, you can use TOR to connect us.
@_date: 2012-01-16 01:09:36
I understand and respect your concerns. We are trying to earn trust by doing a good job in running the site, responding to users as much as we can and staying in business for a long time. As an example of trust we have gained so far you can check out a recent statement that attracted about 400 BTC:
We have concluded this bet and sent the payments to the users.
@_date: 2012-08-16 23:39:26
This should help:
@_date: 2012-08-27 10:22:57
Thank you for all the compliments about [Bets of Bitcoin]( One thing you didn't mention is that losing bets not only distributed proportionally to the winning bets but also in a time weighted manner. So in the end early bets win more, which creates a nice incentive to get in the bet as early as possible.
PS: For people interested, review of our site begins around 29:45.
@_date: 2012-07-10 03:59:18
Care to explain? I guess not.
@_date: 2011-09-14 14:23:57
We keep getting new users, and we can reach the register page. What is your set up (browser, OS etc.)?
@_date: 2011-08-25 20:20:19
We appreciate your support.
@_date: 2011-08-15 11:34:04
You can always complain us through email. We'll try to eliminate ambiguous statements at the submission state and we'll try to be responsive to users. But in the end our policy is "moderator has the last word". After all, service we are offering is essentially an independent third party referee on the bet results.
@_date: 2011-08-14 23:14:29
Moderators do the fact checking.
@_date: 2011-08-15 17:49:46
I agree that decimals are a better option. Working on it.
@_date: 2011-11-17 16:04:15
I think bitcoin should first conquer the digital world. I can think of a few fronts:
* Convince website owners, bloggers, wiki admins, users of youtube, flickr, deviantart etc. to put bitcoin donation addresses on their front page. We should have guides to do this quickly and easily, possibly referring to both client and online wallet services.
* Convince digital content creators (ebook writers, indy musicians etc.) to sell their stuff in bitcoins as well. There should be easy to follow guides to do this.
* Convince game developers to use bitcoin as in-game currency and for subscriptions. We can market it as the "Return of the Arcade". Developers probably need less guides but more awareness. BTW as you might know we have a [game site on event predictions](
Once we have professional looking guides in place, we can go ahead and start a massive grassroots campaign in the community by emailing, tweeting, FBing to reach these people.
@_date: 2011-08-25 19:40:49
We are trying to bring it back. I'll update status here:
@_date: 2011-08-14 16:08:13
Yes, it looks like a floating point problem. And I think I know how to solve it. Stay tuned, it should be done in a few hours.
@_date: 2011-10-14 03:30:15
We have contacted by several other bettors as well. We were hoping that court will give an official word, but it didn't happen. So today we closed the statement as "False", so actually you won your bet. We are sorry that you were not satisfied with the service, we had no intention to keep bitcoins unnecessarily.
@_date: 2011-08-14 16:09:50
Your account balance is -0.0005, because you are paying for network fees.
@_date: 2011-10-14 03:36:01
We definitely welcome short term bets. Most of the bets are user created and so far users preferred to create long term bets. It was actually a surprising for us.
We are sorry to leave a scammer impression on you. Currently there is no way of safe bitcoin investment, so we keep all the betted coins and most of the available coins in an offline server.
@_date: 2011-08-19 03:12:40
I am glad to hear your interest. Unfortunately, we don't have an API right now, and nothing is planned. So I can not promise anything. But you are welcome to manually create bets, I can offer commission free bet creation for your event only and personal attention for promptly closing bets. Let me know.
@_date: 2011-08-14 19:00:02
To be honest, no. But the others mainly focus on sports betting or bitcoin market betting. We try to focus on more long term items with a wide variety (science, politics etc.). You can help the diversity by submitting a statement.

I've just approved a [bet on the success of the attack](
@_date: 2011-08-15 15:22:57
Thanks for taking time to give well-thought feedback.
We are glad that you liked our design decisions. Credit should go to the designer Luis Zuno, who is not affiliated with our site.
We reduced the confirmation number to get fast feedback like yours. Confirmation requirements will increase soon.
Now the main issue, the betting system. It is technically called [parimutuel betting]( and it is how betting is done for a long time. We haven't invented it. We just added a little twist by time weight and submitter commission. Prediction markets are a new betting system which is designed to do predictions using market forces. They look like stock markets but they actually are not. In a prediction market you know your possible returns (one of two choices) at the time of bet. Whereas in the stock market the stock may do any arbitrary thing in the future. Essentially you are increasing your risk by reducing predictability but increase your possible returns as well (essentially unbounded). In our system early bettors also increase their possible (essentially unbounded) returns by increasing risks. If you are a person who wants to know your possible returns at time of bet, you can still wait until the deadline, see the market odds and do your calculations at the cost of foregoing your share in the second %45 slice.
In this system all bets has to be final. Let's say deadline is approaching and you have an early bet on the most probable side. Would you like to see everybody on the other side switch sides? Although currently we allow people to put a bet on the opposite side as well, if they change their mind and want to reduce losses. But there is another twist that can be added to the system. Every bet is a ticket with two attributes, amount and weight. We can allow user to trade them at the prices they set. You can sell your early bets with high weights at a higher price. Would you be interested in such a scheme?
@_date: 2011-08-14 16:27:58
OK. It should be fixed now. Please test.
@_date: 2011-08-14 19:43:30
Welcome dj! Thanks for the kind wishes.
@_date: 2011-09-12 21:17:44
I can answer your questions about [Bets of Bitcoin]( Basically you can submit anything to bet and if someone challenges you, you may win. We have an unusual (but we think fair and fun) distribution scheme of losing bets. You can read more about it in our help page. As far as we can see we have the largest amount of bitcoins in active bets, our current most popular bet is over 50 BTC! Large betting community is important to be able to find a challenger.

This is the admin here. Unfortunately we are having major issues with the hosting provider. Their response is very slow, probably they are overwhelmed by the support tickets right now. We are not sure about the on-site data but **we have off-site backups**. Database and wallet is safe. At worst we may lose couple of hours of bets (which may be nothing at all). I'll try to communicate as much as possible here. Don't worry we are not going anywhere.
**UPDATE 1:** More than 24 hours passed since we notified the host but there is still no resolution. Somehow the virtual machine is formatted and snapshots are gone, at least on our control panel. We don't know if the files still exist somewhere on the hardware node. We could start from scratch, but don't want to invest time on the system before we understand why it happened.
**UPDATE 2:** We decided to change our hosting provider. We should be back in a few days. I'll post on reedit when we are back. If you need a withdrawal you can PM me.
**UPDATE 3:** **We are back!** Enjoy your betting! 
@_date: 2011-08-14 17:30:15
No I used the "epsilon technique":
    epsilon = 0.000000001
    if amount &lt;= balance + epsilon:
@_date: 2011-08-14 16:34:52
Current bitcoin client asks for 0.0005 fee, it will also apply when you are withdrawing your funds.
I am glad that you appreciate our design. Let me know if you have any issues.
