What is Coinbase really offering in addition?  Let's break it down:
1.  Simpler user interface - does this really make it a different type of product?  I'd argue it's the same type of product, just with a better designed UI.
2.  The ability to instantly buy via CC.  True, Gemini doesn't offer this.
3.    ACH purchases that are "locked in" - kind of.  Gemini let's you instantly deposit ACH and make a purchase, locking it in, but only up to $500.  If you jump through a bunch of hoops, Coinbase will indeed let you lock in a greater quantity of BTC via ACH.
4.  The exchange rate determined by Coinbase, not specific demand from other traders - this is just an extra fee.  The Coinbase price is always higher than the GDAX price.  This is purely a bug, not a feature.
5. Multi-sig and vault storage - these are add-on features that Coinbase itself didnt' have a couple years ago.  Features that a user might find valuable, but they don't make comparison between the products impossible.  I'd also argue that using a 3rd party company for "paper storage" is moronic to the extreme.  The entire purpose of the vault is undermined by the fact that it requires you to trust Coinbase and their security protocols; very little added value relative to their hot wallet.  The same coins could be stolen in similar ways.

Sorry to hear that you're still down money )-:  I think in an other year we'll finally be above the 2013 highs.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:35:25
Agreed that this is the most likely case.  The way the BU client is currently configured, it will fork the network *only if* it has majority hash power over a sustained period.  In other words, I'm not predicting that BU will win.  But in the case that BU forks, it means it already has a substantial advantage in hashpower that may lead to it winning.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:34:13
No, the current hash algorithm is optimized for solution by ASICs.  This produces a natural extreme "economy of scale" that leads to what economists call a "natural monopoly."
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:29:45
Yes indeed.  Why are you angry?
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:06:45
You realize segwit is a far more complex change than BU, right?
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:01:34
If you had invested 1 BTC in the world's best performing hedge funds at the end of 2013, you'd have more than 2 bitcoins today.
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:09:59
um, the security of the bitcoin network (and hence its value) is entirely predicated on proof of work. If majority of hashing power is on a competing chain, wouldn't it be the insecure chain that likely loses value?  
@_date: 2017-02-21 05:20:11
Lol.  Everyone's already all-in, nothing to speculate with left.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:49:52
One of bitcoin's problems is that it looks like Proof of Stake can provide comparable trustless security at a tiny fraction of the cost.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:09:36
Oh I agree entirely.  These new adopters are just that though, new adopters.  They're not looking for a quick trade based on the ETF.  I've had a bunch of friends buy bitcoin for the first time ever in the past 2 months.  Some have heard about the ETF and that might be influencing their decision at the margin, but none have any plans to sell their bitcoin regardless of whether the ETF happens or not.
@_date: 2017-02-21 12:43:39
Early adopters.  30 yo crypto nerds who started mining in 2010 while they were grad students, accrued tens of thousands of BTC have been gradually selling it off.  They were effectively the "weak hands" (in a very long-term sense) looking to diversify, take profits, and monetize their massive and unexpected bitcoin wealth.  Many still hold a "substantial" amount of BTC, but a fraction of what they once held; they won't be buying back-in.  They like having a mansion and yacht.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:08:09
Your alternative to signalling is what, just let blockstream/core dictate block sizes?
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:47:10
In this analogy, bitcoin dies right?  99% of the internet companies that existed in 1991 went bankrupt to be replaced by newer, more innovative technologies.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:06:25
Agree completely, just switch segwit and BU.  Segwit is a mountain of complex code that changes the nature of bitcoin.  BU is a far simpler and direct scaling upgrade.  Let litecoin and others test out segwit first, and use BU for immediate scaling needs.
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:08:04
Segwit adoption is falling. 
What's plan B?
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:22:09
Um, I have most of my net worth in bitcoin.  This is a serious concern to me.  It looks like Segwit won't be adopted, and I'm worried about a contentious hard fork.  I haven't seen any serious discussion from the Core crowd over how to deal with this.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:33:01
Ah, I see your confusion.  Bitcoin is open source.  Literally every line of code that a developer develops for bitcoin is simultaneously free for any bitcoin-based altcoin.  A developer for BU *is* a developer for Core and vice versa, at least until they fork enough to be incompatible.
What's shit about BU?  I think a lot of people wonder why people are pretending that Blockstream/Core having a monopoly over bitcoin is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:58:51
Really weird questions from you.  hitch wants competition...the problem is that current hash algorithm discourages it.
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:14:13
Are you confusing Germany for the US?  The claim that I'm debunking is that US based financial institutions do this regularly, or that it is in any way related to US laws and regulations.
I can name a dozen US financial institutions, as well as US bitcoin exchanges and brokers that specifically do *not* demand access to your webcam.  
I never claimed that *no* institution any where does it.  That's why I specifically wrote, "that I'm aware of."
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:36:15
Market participants are mostly rational.  They place little value on insecure coins.  
The way the BU client is currently configured, it will fork the network only if it has majority hash power over a sustained period. In other words.   Do you get that?  BU will fork if and only if Core is fundamentally insecure.
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:52:45
You're claiming that influence over developers is the goal in and of itself?  Why not just hire the developers directly then like Adam Back did with Blockstream?  Why be so circuitous and pay miners?  Just bribe the developers directly like Back.
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:58:19


Nope.  No other institution that I'm aware of does this.  Gemini has to follow just as strict New York regulatory rules, but doesn't do this.  This has *nothing* to do with the government.


Nope.  A pic is insufficient.  They used to ask for a pic.  Now they demand your webcam.
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:41:07
You really think they required access to my friend's webcam, and no one else's?  Really?
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:40:24
We could technically hard fork to turn bitcoin into Unreal 3.  In a hard fork, you can change just about anything.  So "technically" bitcoin could be software to make accounting spreadsheets.

I used Coinbase extensively and exclusively until about 6 months ago.  From a "trust" perspective, I thought it was best in the sense that they were least likely to abscond with your funds.  
Now Gemini offers a similar level of trust, but with less hassle and much lower fees.
@_date: 2017-02-24 22:10:46
Why do they need it if Gemini and almost all other New York based financial institutions don't?
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:32:37
Yes, Gemini was the biggest pain in the butt to open an account I've ever had to deal with.  Their support was responsive though.
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:44:41
Ah, that is a rare exception.  Weren't great though?  They produced by far the best product for a long while; it wasn't until they had cemented their lead as the world's producer of OS and office tools that they lost their reputation as the worlds' best engineers.  I'm hoping bitcoin might be big enough to survive technological obsolescence, but it's far from out of the woods in that regard.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:49:14
Bitcoin has tons of counterparty risk, it's just a bit different than we're used to.  Who do you trust more as a counterparty, the US government or a half dozen miners, 4 of whom are located in China?  Who can be more easily bribed/coerced?
Any person or government could destroy bitcoin today if they're willing to burn &lt;$3 billion to undermine the network's doublespend integrity.  Probably much, much cheaper if they're willing to coerce/bribe existing pools.  Such an act couldn't make anyone money, but maybe the NSA or China would be happy to spend a couple billion to prevent the threat.
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:48:17
It's not terribly difficult to create a professional looking website.  
Aside from that, these "extra layers of security" are not used by firms that manage far greater sums than Coinbase.  I work as a customer, employee, and service provider to 20+ financial firms and don't know of a single one that has ever required access to a user's webcam.  Collectively they manage hundreds of billions of dollars and millions of user accounts.  All without webcam access...
Lastly, okay, let's say someone creates an account in your name.  Then what?  That happens every day in far more damaging contexts with home and car loans and credit cards.  If someone borrows money in my name, I'm much more likely to be hurt than if someone creates cryptocurrency exchange account in my name.

@_date: 2017-02-03 01:40:51
I think you have it backwards.  Anyone can clone bitcoin at any time.  The code is open source.  The entire premise of the value of the network is the security provided by PoW.  A blockchain that's insecure will immediately see its price collapse.

@_date: 2017-02-03 01:59:48
Because...of the satoshi white paper and the first couple years of bitcoin's existence?  The only reason mining became supercentralized is a poor choice of mining algorithm.
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:51:43
ah, I see your confusion.  No, Gemini offers the same service as Coinbase as well as GDAX.  Specifically, Gemini lets you convert fiat to BTC or ETH via ACH or wire transfer.  They just let you do it faster and cheaper.
The only thing I'm aware of that Coinbase offers that Gemini doesn't is long-term storage of your private keys.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:46:28
I think you're confused about what "using" software means.  Think about a typical person who uses facebook on their smart phone.  That person is making use of more than 50 different and almost unrelated pieces of software; the cellphone software, the TCP internet protocols, the phone software, the file storage software on facebook's servers, the server software on the fiber optic switching stations that run the internet etc etc etc.  People don't know or care.
Similarly, the vast majority of crypto users are unlikely to even know they're using it, and that's fine.  Crypto will serve as the hidden backbone of a great variety of services.  For example, let's say I want to send you $10 through my phone.  An app charges me $10, and you get $10 on the other side, and in between, unbenknownst to either of us, that $10 was converted to some crypto with 1 second confirmation times and &lt;$0.01 transmission costs.
Bitcoin can never be adopted as a consumer currency since the network itself is too inefficient.  Bitcoin is already 2 generations obsolete for monetary transmission.  It may succeed as a niche store of value like digital gold.

@_date: 2017-02-24 20:16:54


Not quite.  you correct this in the next sentence:


Bingo, exactly.


Also true.


Incorrect.  Gemini Exchange for example, the New York based brainchild of the Winklevii brothers follows all applicable KYC and NYL laws in the toughest state in the country and do not require anything face to face.  They simply require the same exhaustive list of ID as almost all other money transmitters and financial institutions:  pictures/scans of ID, proof of address, and information that can be used to conduct a background check.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:43:33
Using bitcoin is selling bitcoin in exchange for a product or service.
Bitcoin will never gain widespread use because it's a horribly inefficient network for monetary transmission.  It may succeed as digital gold, I hope.
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:57:07
No, all exchanges and financial institutions require ID.  Coinbase used to be like the rest and require that you provide a picture of the front and back of your ID.  They can then run it through a database of state IDs to confirm its valid.  Coinbase is the only financial institution I'm aware of that won't accept a picture of your ID.
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:44:39
Spot on.  That's the point I was trying to make to the "triples in value" poster.
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:03:40

What's the agenda?  How does Ver personally profit from facilitating more bitcoin transactions?  It sounds like you're suggesting he's just donating his money for the good of the bitcoin ecosystem?
In contrast, we know how blockstream profits from small blocks...
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:30:06
BU is trying to *decentralize* bitcoin.  Bitcoin is currently centralized under the control of Core/Blockstream.  Wouldn't it be nice to have competing development teams?
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:34:50
This is true, just very premature.  Artificially raising transaction prices now just spoon feeds users to bitcoin competitors, granting them network effects that could eventually cause them to challenge bitcoin's dominance.
@_date: 2017-02-03 03:24:35
Satoshi mistakenly thought that bitcoin mining would remain relatively decentralized.  He didn't foresee the rise of ASICs, and for the first couple years of bitcoin's existence, people were mining it from their desktops.
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:30:38
There's no law or regulation in the US that requires webcam access; that's why Gemini and almost all other financial institutions don't.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:37:15
They lack use cases until they achieve scale.  A few are nearing billion dollar market caps, and they have much faster transaction times and lower costs than bitcoin.  How long you think until more and more vendors start accepting them?  Already the darknets are switching over to monero.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:27:42
It won't be easy to buy Core coins.  With 1/4 the hashpower, you're looking at probably 40 minute confirmations and $10+ fees per transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:25:59
Core/Blockstream say so...2 years ago, most of the bitcoin ecosystem asked for an immediate HF to 4 or 8 MB.  Even Adam Back agreed.  Then the blockstream business plan went live...
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:31:04


This is a weird piece of a dogma I see repeated over and over by true believers without a shred of evidence.  Core/Blockstream's commitment to strangling transaction volume hasn't led to more full nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:26:00
You misunderstand.  Jihan is a primary stakeholder in the bitcoin ecosystem.  No one benefits more than him from bitcoin price appreciation and a thriving network.
With Ver it's less clear, since he may have sold most of his BTC now, we don't know.  But as of a year ago, his incentives were perfectly aligned with the bitcoin community as a huge bitcoin holder.  Want to know who has perverse incentives?  Blockstream-Core; they profit specifically from a stagnant bitcoin blockchain with high fees.
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:28:56
right, that was the point....
I would note though that the previous all time high isn't an arbitrary point of comparison.  
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:23:33


I'm honestly surprised to see such a weird misunderstanding.  Everyone knew before any HF happened that all blockchains are immutable except for forks.  A fork happening is simply a substantiation of the always possible mutability.  Ethereum effectively reversed one single transaction and exploded in value partly because of it.  Bitcoin is just as mutable from a technological perspective, but arguably less mutable due to the difficulty of achieving political consensus.  This is partly why bitcoin has fallen two full generations behind technologically.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:28:32
He's financially invested in *bitcoin*.  All of his advocacy is his selfish interest to increase the value of his and our bitcoins.
You know who has a conflicting economic interest?  Blockstream and the Core devs who work for them who profit from high fees and a transaction backlog via sidechains.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:36:14
agreed.  As BU is constructed, the HF will only happen if and when it has majority hashpower support, and is therefore the longer and more secure chain.  And indeed, in that scenario, the weaker minority chain, the core chain, will collapse quickly.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:28:50
You're kidding right?  A HF to increase block size has been discussed for **2 years.** In that time, entire new cryptos have been born and achieved billion dollar market caps with technology stacks that put bitcoin to shame.
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:41:43
The problem is that the r-bitcoin side is its emotionally invested in maintaining an effective political dictatorship and technological stagnation.  Hard forks are death, especially any hard fork not produced by core/blockstream.
That conspiracy theory you mention...you know it's based on simple public facts right?  Blockstream didn't "bribe" core's top developers, it literally hired them.  Right in public.  Nothing secretive about it.  Many of core's biggest devs literally work for blockstream.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:29:29
you mean like how Core/Blockstream already did?
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:29:47

@_date: 2017-02-02 23:09:41
Who do you think is paying off miners?  
Almost all bitcoin companies that I'm aware of supported an immediate HF to 2 mb+ 18 months ago.  Adam Back did as well back then.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:26:58
Why do you still have cash?  Why buy at $800 when you could've bought for $200 just 18 months ago?
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:23:46
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about...I never defended BU...
Your response is like saying that myspace is a great business because friendster is even worse...
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:38:09
You're confused.  BU is constructed to only HF *if* it has majority hashpower.  So by your logic, if BU hardforks, it will win.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:31:12


Everything...you wrote about being cautious and testing.  I noted that Core has been cautious and testing for 2 years.  How much more cautious and how much more testing do you want?


 First, SegWit is only a 1.7x increase in capacity **at most, after it's fully adopted.**  Second, SegWit as soft fork is considered *less safe* than the hard fork version by most developers.  And third, we needed 2 MB a year ago.  Now we need 4 MB.  And hopefully in another year we'll need 8 MB.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:33:27
This is absolutely true.  Miners don't set the rules, Maxwell and Back set the rules as owners of Blockstream.  And they want higher on-chain fees to support their business model, and so that's what they get.
Of course, 2 years ago, all of the biggest bitcoin companies, developers, and miners all agreed that they wanted an immediate HF to 4+ MB.  But blockstream said no, so that's where we are.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:39:46
you can call it whatever you want.  The fact is simply that the blockchain that has more hashpower and more economic value will be more secure and worth more.  You're free to mine the minority chain and call it whatever the hell you want.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:26:45
Decentralized governance?  Who are we kidding?  The vast majority of the bitcoin ecosystem including all of the biggest companies and miners asked for an immediate HF 2 years ago.  Blockstream/Core said no, so there was no HF...
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:30:35
Check out the hashpower voting.  They're close.  And much closer than Core's Segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:37:21
Obsolete technologies die.  We *should* be worried...there's a lot of competition that's aggressively innovating, and improving on the basic bitcoin roadmap.  
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:37:43
and drugs...pretty much same as today.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:27:52
Isn't more than half of all bitcoin mining already controlled by one guy?
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:31:53
Have you bothered to look at the numbers?  Less than half of miners support SegWit.  No altcoin promoter controls half of mining.
The bitcoin community wanted an immediate HF to 4 MB 2 years ago.  Blockstream said no, they wanted higher fees.  So that's what we got.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:43:18
*we're* so screwed...we're on a stagnant technological platform and the only serious innovators are too buggy.  What happened to Friendster again?
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:27:09
Technologies innovate or die.  Want to know how to destroy bitcoin for good for sure?  Never hard fork and let competing cryptos leapfrog you in efficiency and features.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:38:39
Lol...compare the commits to the **invention of smart contracts or the invention of zero-knowledge proofs and perfect anonymity** all of which occurred while bitcoin devs were struggling to debug SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:43:36
Certainly.  All of the big bitcoin companies have said they want an immediate HF to bigger blocks.  THey said that two full years ago.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:34:39
Who gets to define what's hostile?  Currently BU has more support than Segwit, does that make Segwit hostile?
The bitcoin community (the vast majority of miners, users, and bitcoin companies) all asked for an immediate HF to at least 2 MB 2 years ago.  Even Adam Back of Blockstream said he supported it.  BU only exists because Core/Blockstream somehow blocked the will of the community.
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:31:34
Kind of.  If there wasn't a tradeoff between trust and efficiency, bitcoin would simply have a 1mb block every 10 seconds.  All proposals for off-chain settlement entail more trust than a current bitcoin on-chain transaction.
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:51:35

I provided you with links that proved you wrong.  You have no facts on your side.  You lose.  You claimed I was lying when I said that 70%+ of miners publicly stated they supported a HF, but I proved you wrong with direct links to quotes from the largest mining pools.  You lose.
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:40:48
You've got it backwards.  When the market is collapsing, by definition, market makers are getting long.  That's what being a market maker means - you're taking the opposite position to the market's movement.  Indeed, sometimes those market makers then get forced out of their longs which can exacerbate a decline, but the market makers are only getting short then.  
You're thinking way too narrowly though.  In the very short-term, yes bitcoin is driven by technicals and traders.  In even the medium-term though, it's now being driven by new user adoption.  It doesn't matter what the current speculators do, it matters how many *new* buyers are entering the market.
Based on the exposure and fundamentals, there should be tons of new buyers buying over the next year.  If we're &lt;$1100 in a year, it will mean that's not happening, which means bitcoin's fundamental story is wrong.

It's 2 days past arrival.  I use ACH constantly and it has never taken 6+ business days to clear ever.  I suspect Coinbase is simply being slow to process the cleared payment.

Clear you've never been a professional trader.  There are patterns to asset markets.  When a new technology is born it either achieves market dominance or dies.  Bitcoin certainly had a great first phase, exploding out of the gates.  Now comes the second test - mass adoption.  All the circumstances are perfect for bitcoin to succeed in phase 2.  If it can't, it means something fundamental to the hypothesis is wrong.

Jesus you're delusional.  If you've dismissed the facts when they were in front of you in the past, I don't see why you'd suddenly accept them now, but here we go.  Here are mining pools saying they want a HF.  Now stop lying about it you delusional idiot.
If you don't trust the source, I can provide you with 5 others that cite the same tweets and quotes from mining pool CEOs.


No, that's the *business plan* that Blockstream publicly presented you idiot.  Ask Adam Back yourself.  He's been very public about how Blockstream plans to turn a profit.

This is true for all cryptos; but of course off-chain transactions are off-chain.

over $1100 within 6 weeks, over $4k by end of 2017.  That's the natural trading cycle if we are indeed in a bull market.  If we're only at $1k by end of 2017 it means bitcoin is doomed.

Bitcoin will never be a currency; it's already obsolete in that regard.  There are already (and will be much better in the future) cryptos that simply outshine bitcoin technologically as mediums of exchange.
But that's actually *good* for bitcoin, because currencies don't necessarily appreciate in value.  In contrast, bitcoin is likely to become "digital gold", a store of value.  It's obsolescence is actually attractive in that regard, similar to gold - we like knowing that it's not changing.
The point is that less than 1% of the world has heard of bitcoin, and less than 0.01% owns any.  For bitcoin is even have marginal success, it must grow.   The # of new coins being created is now quite small relative to the existing supply.  If user adoption is healthy, it will force the price up sharply.  If the price isn't rising sharply it means user adoption isn't healthy, and then we're forced to ask why, given the ideal conditions for it.  Demonetization in India, Chinese capital controls...this is bitcoin's time to explode.  And I think it will.  If it doesn't, that's very bearish though.

What on earth are you talking about?  It's Nasdaq's private blockchain.  That's it, not complicated, and it would never use bitcoin.  Why one earth subject your business to a public blockchain with arbitrarily long confirmation delays and high fees?  Why not go with a private one with &lt;5 second confirmations and zero fees?
Similarly, many banks have launched their own internal private blockchains for asset management.
There are many blockchains already launched that don't use tokens because they have no need for tokens.

Did you bother following the individual sources?  They start in 2015.  You must be embarrassed


Lol, that's your defense?  That the companies didn't want to be listed somewhere?  You realize you've just conceded the argument right?  The list links to the actual quotes on twitter and corporate web pages.  By whining that the companies were mad their quotes got aggregated you're conceding that the quotes are real and prove my case.


Incorrect.  Both 2 MB and 4 MB HFs have already been coded and tested and could be rolled out within a week.  The only obstacle is Core's threat of "scorched earth", to devalue the network if we HF.


Lol, were you writing this to yourself?  I provided you with exact sources that prove you wrong but you are too stupid or stubborn to understand even the simplest facts.
You lost buddy.  Either find sources that somehow counter mine, or move on with your life.  I provided you with the exact facts you demanded.  It's over.

Trouble reading?  From your own link: **"It's free within the U.S. to send money to family and friends when you use only your PayPal balance or bank account, or a combination of their PayPal balance and bank account."**
I use paypal constantly and have spent a grand total of $0 on fees.  I also transfer bitcoin constantly and have spent more than $200 in BTC fees.

The problem is that the vast majority of the bitcoin ecosystem (70%+ of miners, 70%+ of users, and 70%+ of bitcoin companies) all said a year ago that they wanted a hard fork for scaling within 6 months.  It didn't happen, why?  Because the top Core Devs opposed it.
Most of those top Core Devs also run Blockstream.  Blockstream's financial success depends on bitcoin not scaling (since they intend to profit indirectly off the Lightning Network which is a potential solution to Bitcoin's scaling problem).  In other words, the top core devs blocked on-chain scaling while simultaneously planning to profit from their own provision of off-chain scaling.  At the very best, it's an ugly conflict of interest.

The top bitcoin core devs decide how bitcoin develops.  They also are the co-founders and primary equity holders of Blockchain, a for-profit company that aims to profit by plugging holes in bitcoin with their own code.  You don't see the conflict?
@_date: 2016-12-27 23:10:34
Yes.  Are you misconstruing constructive criticism?  Their entire platform was built to support bitcoin so of course they wanted bitcoin to continue to innovate.  When it became clear that the community was dragging its feet on necessary upgrades, they offered constructive criticism.  When the community *still* dragged its feet to avoid basic obsolescence, they explored adding other cryptos for transaction purposes.  You realize that's what Core itself advocated right?  Until LN is out or some other type of level 2 protocol, Core suggests using other cryptos for cheaper transactions.
@_date: 2016-12-31 02:20:15


Yes they do.  It seems like you haven't been paying attention.  More than 70% of miners, 70% of end users, and 70% of bitcoin companies all said they wanted a HF within 6 months, more than a year ago.  It didn't happen because Core opposed it.


When companies are formed, they have to register within a state as for-profit or non-profit.  Just do a google search to learn the difference.


Maybe because it's based in reality?  Just google search "gregory maxwell" to confirm the conflicts of interest for yourself.
@_date: 2017-01-29 14:27:18
Sounds like you're the one under a rock.  Segwit hasn't been adopted by most miners and so is producing no blocksize increase.  Even if it was adopted, the increase is trivial - already overwhelmed by the growing transaction volume of the last 3 months.
Are you really confusing an alpha test for a usable product?  How many consumers are able to use lightning network to avoid BTC fees?

Isn't he the opposite of a sell-out?  Spoke truth to power and put his money where his mouth is.  The sellouts are the one's blocking a consensus HF to create a need for their for-profit business solutions (cough blockstream cough)
@_date: 2016-12-27 20:49:26
I'd love to not pay taxes.  But the IRS has a whole lot of ways have catching you without Coinbase's help.  If no one ever reports you to the IRS (i.e. if you have no political or personal enemies), your odds of getting audited in any particular year are very low.  But after 10 or 20 years, the odds are pretty high.  And then if you've spent any of your undeclared bitcoins, you might be screwed.
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:51:53
Coinbase works for their customers.  Since most of those customers want to connect their US regulated bank accounts to a company that's forced to obey US laws, that means that Coinbase also has to obey US laws.  1 + 1 = 2.  No way to have it both ways.
You can have a company that is subject to US laws that you can trust, or you can have a company that violates the US's KYC laws.  Can't have both.
@_date: 2016-12-31 15:13:14


You're lying or strangely ignorant.  A quick google search reveals it's true.  Almost every large mining pool public stated in 2015 that they supported a HF to 2, 4, or 8 MB.


You're now conceding the point but getting confused as to the "why."  The "game theory" as to why Core controls bitcoin is because the other participants are more risk averse.  This is all quite public.  The largest mining pools begged Core to produce a 2 MB HF, but said they would not support a HF by non-Core devs because of the risk that a contentious HF would devalue their hardware.  Simple game theory really.  Every single claim I've made is easily confirmable with a quick google search, and the "why" comes down to one paragraph of game theory.  Strange that you're struggling to grasp it.
It's also bizarre that you don't see the contradiction in your logic.  You say that it doesn't matter what miners want because they don't control consensus rules, and it also doesn't matter what economically important bitcoin node operators want, because some have obeyed KYC laws...sorry, not everyone agrees that miners/users/companies must all be subservient to a dozen Core oligopolists maintaining holes in bitcoin so Blockstream can profit by filling them.
