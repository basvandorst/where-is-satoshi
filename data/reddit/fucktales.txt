These are the answers I was looking for, thanks so much! If I knew how to do that +tip thing I see on here, I would (guess I better go do some research on that next).

Isn't there a fixed number of total coins to eventually be mined? Forgive me, I'm still fairly ignorant to all of this and haven't quite wrapped my head around the whole thing, trying to learn as much as I can.

Yeah right Mr. Lives on a cardboard box, you're gonna cash that thing out for Black Tar Heroin tomorrow and we all know it.

That's what I thought, by my question I meant how long will it take to reach that number, and once the number of bitcoins that have been mined already begins to approach 21 million won't mining cease to be profitable due to electricity costs? At that point, what will be the incentive for people to continue to mine so that total can be reached?

In my post I specified that I was not doing anything worthwhile anyway. I have it set to my homepage so that I can do it quickly before I check reddit and otherwise goof around online.

Once all of the second batch of ASICs get up and running, how long it will take before it gets close to all the bitcoins being mined, and mining ceases to be profitable? What will be the incentive for miners to get the last few mined, and are these things even foreseeable?

OK, cool, I get it. Thanks!

Is this faucet useful for someone like me not involved in software development? Can I actually receive bitcoins with it?
