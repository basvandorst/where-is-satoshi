The only think I have said with absolute certainty is that it is my personal belief that there are sketchy things happening there, and that there should be a thorough criminal investigation by the appropriate authorities. 
And also, of course the class action suit that has already been filed by other customers (the pdf).

is this not a problem? Without the ability to create more (a fixed amount of coins) it makes sense that the remaining coins would become even more valuable, but would there ever be a case where enough of them are lost that the overall btc system is affected? Satoshi being an example. He has billions of dollars in coin that is most likely gone forever. Given the extreme security measures that people use to keep their coins safe, when people die without telling anybody their keys or lose them through data loss, could this eventually be a burden to the btc system?

yes, but i'm hoping as we got closer to aug 1st people will start second guessing themselves and selling off a few coin leading to a more substantial dip and more volatility. I get my guns cocked and i'm ready to pull the trigger, I just hope a bunch of you guys freak out and dump on the day before lol so I can get in at 800 or something retarded.
