seems u love to make trade with bitcoin ???

no room for speculators in free economy
on the end i think speculators will be burned wery wery bad
on the end now speculators wona go to mtgox wona bet on this tragedy even make a market to trade with btc/mtgoxbtc

that is ok u are speculator and u MUST risk and i hope u aware of fact that btc is unregulated
if somone do not need for speculation and use btc for anything else they do not need to convert their btc to mtgoxBTC  or bitstampBTC or whateverBTC  they will put their btc on blockchain where they are secure from stealing

What is needed here is to ignore mtgox on all community web sites and let it sink .
I'm realy sorry for all hard earning people who stuck with this but this delay progress of all criptos and delay our comon goal

u meen someone place mtgox gambling chips in something call mtogx$  200k and the limit order at this is mtogx$260 ???
not it not unusual 
unusual is when exchange work on some other planet and people in there are cen not  connect thier assets with this planet and in the same time one who contorl this asset  CEN and  DO trade on other exchanges  THAT IS UNUSUAL
EXCHANGE this world meen open exchange with no stoping on withdrawal again some fools here think they will be super if they deposit their money in that hole
im 100% shure that deposits will go tru (usual banking procedures)

real BTC will not be losted at least not from BTC !!!
mtgoxBTC will be losted in huge numbers
real BTC one on blockchain will be pop up on some unexpected places like the final chapter of Magic
for this comunity is to determinate where real BTC is now going and all of that is on blocchain before our noses
