 Did you try CEX? They allow purchasing Bitcoin (and not only this crypto) by debit and credit cards. Moreover, the company has renewed their wires option: r/ , so probably that would be even easier to use.

 Agree. His speech is brilliant! So simply and clearly explained, with quite understandable examples. Our moms really should watch this, even a child is able to grasp the gist.

 Buying from people is not very reliable. And it's really hard to find a trader. It's anyway better at the exchanges like CEX (r/ or Coinmama, with a history on the market and a huge number of users.

 I don’t think that bitcoin can run away from blockchain somewhere else))) As for the bitcoin price and its current situation, I think it will keep slowly growing, without notable spikes. But the price depends on so many factors that the slightest action can provoke both uptrend and downtrend. I believe that the price will rise and blockchain will be widely adopted in all fields.

 Well as far as know fees may vary in dependence of platform that you’re using and chosen payment method. Maybe you just need to search for a platform with low fees?

 Honestly, I haven’t seen any exchanges that offering totally free trading. As far as I know, it works a little bit differently.  Exchanges can offer reduced or even zero fees as a bonus. Maybe there is a place where it's also possible under certain conditions. Anyway, such things vary from platform to platform. As for exchanges with a cold storage, you can try cex (r/ I think that their security level is high enough. Speaking about fees, they may vary in dependence of chosen payment method.

 Your explanation is pretty good, but I can add that one block can contain many transactions, so the block itself isn't equal to one transaction.

 I am sorry to hear this happened to you. But why do you think that such sort of thing cannot happen with bitcoin. A lot of people lost their access in bitcoin too. Plus there are also risks of exchanges be hacked, wallets be compromised, keys be lost. Everything concerning money includes risks. Nobody’s insured against such situations. Just be more careful when selecting a way of storing funds.

I think Bitcoin and other cryptos will stay for some more time. Some people leave trading, the others enter. And it will go on for a few years. I truly believe that cryptocurrency won't disappear as fast as it might seem.

 It’s a good idea. You can use something like bitgift. Such sites give you a physical card and voucher number to redeem the coins. Or you can set up a paper wallet, buy bitcoin on any good exchange like CEX and send it to the wallet whenever you want. Plus you can write a nice poem and use it as the passphrase for a wallet. It would be ideal to couple such present with a book about cryptocurrency that your recipient can learn more.
