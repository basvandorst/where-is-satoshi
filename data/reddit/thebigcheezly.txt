I think some of the things provided by the police are not going to be handled well by markets. I suspect the markets will fail through free riding. I also think economies of scale in information will be a big barrier to entry, causing concentration of market power. I think people will have limited visibility of what they're paying for, breaking the assumptions of market theory, and also that the incentives are for people to buy an aggressive individual protection rather than passive community peace keepers.
You can't detail how it will work which is fine, but seem to have absolute confidence in success. There's weaknesses in each of your suggestions as to how it might be solved, but you're not claiming it would be solved that way so it just leaves it as faith.
I'm a big believer in market getting good results where the environment and incentives are suited. I just haven't seen anything like this before.
Does somewhere already do this currently successfully?

Ok so I'm being robbed, I call 911. Guy shoots someone then runs off before police get there. 
What happens then if I have the 911 only plan? That's the end of it?
Why would the subcontractor for the 911 group want the investigator to succeed? It seems to be against his interest to have crimes solved?  
What about courts etc. Do they get privatised?
Sounds like the third party with data is going to be a monopoly then?
Switch it to another version. A guy gets shot by the 911 squad. What difference would there be between now and the future in terms of service delivery? Sounds like I could pay for the company that's more trigger happy. If I want shoot first, ask questions later, I just pay the premium?

Why have you assumed there would be a competitive market? 
It seems unlikely that it would be.

Isn't information a huge barrier to entry though? 
How could a new startup police force expect to solve crimes with no access to criminal histories?

But by 'getting in' you mean does not buy Bitcoin, they just bet on its price yeah?
