Is my calculation or math wrong somewhere?
honestly asking because I'm calculating my usage based on 0.09$CAD/kwh

Please double check on Jaxx, from what I read they encrypt the keys.
"In the case of the Jaxx wallet, the private key was better protected. The key was put through an AES algorithm which is one of the most secure methods to encrypt data. This is also used by a number of US government agencies to secure their messages.
However, even though the Jaxx developers had properly encrypted the private keys, the implementation of the AES encryption algorithm was in the code base of the application. This means that the encrypted private keys could still be useful for a hacker."

That cat actually looks pretty damn stressed to me...
Pupils dilated
Mouth open because it is panting most likely because it is distressed.(Cat's don't smile!)
