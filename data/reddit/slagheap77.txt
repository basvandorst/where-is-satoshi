Or as the Calzone chef on Seinfeld says, "What the hell do I know about cooking a shirt?!"

Correct. Record at the time, or go back at tax time and look up the historical data... which could be interesting when there are big gaps between prices at different exchanges.

Each of your crypto trade arrows is a taxable event. For each one, you figure out the *then* value of the thing you are getting rid of, and subtract from that the value when you acquired it — aka, the cost basis.  If you’ve bought and sold different amounts, then you probably will do FIFO (first-in, first-out).
Example, with made up price quotes:
* (1) 2015-12-01 Bought 1BTC for @ $300/B
* (2) 2016-06-01 Bought 0.5 BTC  @ $600/B
* (3) 2017-05-01 Traded .2BTC for 1 ETH @ $1K/B and $200/Eth
* (4) 2017–08-01 Sold 1ETH for $300
* (5) 2017-12-01 Sold 1.3BTC at $10K/B
--------- How the IRS sees it:
* (1) and (2) are buys, so nothing taxed here, but you do need to note the cost basis for later
* (3) Even though you traded BTC directly to ETH, the IRS wants you to treat it like it went to US$ in between. 
So you “sold” .2 BTC for $200, and the cost basis for acquiring that first .2 BTC was (.2 * $300 = $60). You pay taxes on the gain of ($200 - $60 =&gt; $140). In this case, since it was more than 1 year since you bought it, you pay at capital gains rate of 15%. 15% of $140 is $21.  **You owe the IRS $21.**
* (4) The cost basis for acquiring that 1 ETH was $200. At this point you are selling it for $300.  You owe taxes on the $100 of profit. In this case it was less than 1 year since acquisition, so you pay your marginal tax rate (Not the capital gains rate). For most people this will be a higher rate. Let’s say 23%. **You owe the IRS $23.**
* (5) You are selling 1.3 BTC for $13,000.  The cost basis for acquiring that 1.3 BTC comes in two parts:
   (The earlier FIFO in step 3 “used up” the first .2BTC, so there’s .8 left at that price.)
  0.8 * $300 = $240
  0.5 * $600 = $300
     For a total cost basis of $540 to acquire that 1.3 BTC.
You are taxed on the profit of $13,000 - $540 = $12460.
These were acquired &gt;1 year ago, so at the capital gains rate of 15% applies. 15% of 12460 is 1869. **You owe the IRS $1869**
If  had included cost basis parts that were both more than and less than 1 year old, you would break it up into two different “sells”.
It’s tempting to want to treat the whole thing as $-&gt;[black box]-&gt;$. ... and the taxes owed should actually work out the same, either way. However the IRS rules mean we must treat each crypto-&gt;crypto trade as a taxable event, and report each event.
If you had switched between BTC and ETH 10 times, you would need to report taxes for each time.
And seriously people... pay your taxes. Anyone tempted to say the IRS won’t find out about all this... well, if you’re wrong, you’re going to have a bad time.
