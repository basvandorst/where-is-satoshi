I'm pretty sure not even the most rampant anti-communist propagandists actually think "communism" killed 100 million anymore. Those numbers come from the so-called Black Book of Communism, which treated Nazi soldiers killed in WWII as "victims of communism" and used fallacious demography which would say that FDR killed 7 million people during the Dust Bowl, but no one accuses him of that. Regardless, this is beyond the point.
Communists make a distinction between personal property and private property. Personal property is things such as your house, your car, your toothbrush, etc., whereas private property is things like land, factories, major equipment, etc. If you think communists are coming for your toothbrush, you might be taking our ironic memes a bit too seriously.

It's like you don't even care about trying to be anywhere remotely close to the truth.

Call me a dumb fuck again, it'll really help your credibility. Makes you look very reasonable.

Legitimately posting Stefan Molyneux now? lmao
