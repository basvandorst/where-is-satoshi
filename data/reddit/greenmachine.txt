i agree with you and i think there are other factors contributing to the problem i responded with more info here:
for you saying theres no evidence to suggest tumbling is causing clogs...you are being a bit slow.
i just got done explaining that my single withdrawl takes 30-50 transactions and all of them at a average of about 600 satoshi per byte, more than 10 times the current fee needed to confirm.
i am one single person. there are 100s of thousands of people that use dnms daily.  so multiply those 100s of thousands of people by 30-50 and make the fee 10 times greater than it needs.
you dont think that adds to the problem?  you are not thinking straight.
they take a big chunk of the economic activity of bitcoin so when you have such a large player making stupid choices of course it adds to the problem; then those who want to make the problem even worse can do so more cheaply, like roger.
you could see the kraken batch withdrawls helped clear some mempool ...if alphabay disabled their mixer right now i think we would see atleast a 30% reduction in transaction volume on the entire bitcoin network.  you people dont understand how much activity goes there.  i know how much business i do, i know how much my competitors do, its crazy how much bitcoin txs we generate alone, i cant imagine how much a single market generates its so large.

you are one of those idiots who have blocked the upgrade and are now crying about fees.
you are the source of our problems with your political bullshit talk.
we see you for what you are.  you cannot hide behind your political speak, we know you are the type who caused this disaster.  all you had to do was put social pressure on the parties who decided to block it but instead you started sucking dicks like there was no food left on the planet.
you are a roger dick sucker if there is one, i have seen your type and your shitty words
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:33:28
i have tried and got no response but i will try again
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:32:27
No and i have messaged support to ask and got no reply.  i have also complained about fees and asked them to disable the stupid fecking mixer and also got no response
bip148 is a great idea that puts the power back into the bracket of users but without large market support it does not seem like it will win.  if AB and more DNMs support it then i think it has a pretty good chance.
i will sign whatever i want and if you dont like that you can go fuck jihans mom.  msg me on alphabay if you want confirmation.  greenmachiner is my user handle on there.  I did not want to pastebin because it leaves more footprint than i would like, being on reddit is already bad enough.
i will ask again about bip148 but expect to be ignored.  these assholes are the ones causing stupid fee pressure and they dont seem willing to take action to do anything because they dont want to upset the money gravy train.  hard to blame them, dnms are cash cows and their milk is like sweet sweet butter.

not enough i get too paranoid when i smoke too much weed.  you would think after 35 years of smoking it i would be better adapted but nope still think embarassing thoughts when im too high
im being purposefully agitated though.  creates good character.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:44:32
good question.  you mistake my post for laying all blame to alphabay.  i am not; instead i am saying they are a large contributor to the problem.  the weekends are historically slower for bitcoin, transaction counts go down on the weekends.  i do not think this applies to darknetmarkets but i also do not think darknetmarkets are the one and only source of transactions.  i think they take a big share, maybe 30% or 40% maximum, so they can be very contributory to the problem.
i dont know about other vendors but my business over the weekends is ususally good.  though i have many weekdays that are often better.  its hit or miss comes in waves.  i think dnms are 24/7 steady volume which is the problem....they add to the problem 24/7 so when you have other actors who wish to contribute to the problem it makes it much easier and cheaper for them to do so.

that would break the sig adding extra info in there
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:55:57
thinking about switching to eth.  these fees are too much.  i want segwit now
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:08:01
throwing money away for no reason is not my choice.  i dont get to decide the fee rate AB uses.  thats not my choice so your reasoning is stupid.
they are forcing that shit on everyone.  give me a choice to decide my fee rate and then i will stop complaining.  they are a monopoloy on the dnm so i dont have choices in this;  if i take my business elsewhere i wont make 1/4 as much
i pay the fee because i have to but dont claim i should like it and that its my choice when its not.  and its not anyone elses choice either so please stop lying

dont forget you towel
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:55:36
why dont you go fuck your mom cause i hear she likes fuck?
im not here to make friends, im here to add perspective that you all are not thinking about.  you can all ignore the elephant in the room but i wont.
facts are facts, and the fact is alphabay is driving a artifical fee rate right now by being a little dumb on there fee rates
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:36:47
no no you are all wrong.  It was benjamin franklen who said that shit you idiots; get your quotes straight.
they who give up their pussyfolds to essential liberty for temp safety from violent thugs with uniforms deserve anal sex.
i would say take a history class but who needs to go to school when you can slang the ganja on dnms to pay for the fam?
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:02:56
i might, i dont know about others but im sure it has taken a good chunk of market share because of these fees.
it would not be so bad at all if alphabay didnt force you to pay 10 times the fee rate plus 30-50 transactions, so they deserve some of the blame.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:04:32
no your wrong and you just dont like the fact.  see the proof here:
if you have not noticed i mutilate a lot of things and i do it on purpose.  its funny to be funny you should try it sometime keeps everyone on their toes especially the DEA
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:01:51
who you callin scumbag ?  im risking my life selling a harmless plant that makes people non-violent.
let me guess, you are one of those douchebags who likes to get drunk and talk shit?  yea well fuck you.
i actually help the problems of society and am doing so to put my family in a better place, what are you doing crying on reddit?
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:57:28
fuck your mom if she likes fuck
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:57:01
this is corect.  he clearly does not.
but i think they have outlived their purpose in this fee environment.  let the feds catch the low hanging fruit if these kids are too stupid to obscure their coins.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:54:07
seriously thinking about using ETH.  the fees are getting too much to bear and i have good profits.
if there is a nasty split in august i will probably switch to eth until it blows over.  
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:41:21
the market offers to be a free mixer. you can send your funds in and remove the taint from them on the withdraw.
they use coinjoin like methods to obscure the coins which requires many rounds of mixing which means lots of tiny outputs.
yes its a utter waste of money.  no i dont think you can follow the transaction thats why its mixing, but i still think its a waste of money
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:33:09
i agree with this statement.  clearly lightning network is the future of bitcoin whether these haters recognize it or not.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:39:01
yes i agree we must fix the issue.  i hear theres a solution that has been in the works for years but a few bitcoin billionares have been blocking it and crying about their vision for bitcoin.
i dont get why everyone is so stupid and does not see this for what it is.  these idiots are the ones blocking the fix to the problem.  who would listen to them?
but yes we must make it so even dnm admins can do fancy shit with their services and still not rape the world
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:53:09
you mistake the content post.  i think dnms and folks like me are the lifeblood of bitcoin.  i think we made it and continue to make it thrive.
but when you have mixers charging 10 times the fee rate and doing 30-50 transactions per withdrawl, that is not being smart.  that is adding to the problem.
