That was a rule a long ass time ago.

It's not that easy when you have employees that need to do the transaction for you. I can't be at every register in case someone comes through looking to pay with btc. 
Give me a tap to pay terminal that removes all interaction from the employee other than verifying the payment was made successfully. Like every other electronic payment method.

Bank charged me 28 bucks to deposit into Coinbase. This was on a recurring buy out of my checking account and just a regular deposit, beware.

I wouldn't buy a new Aventador if I were just btc rich, you'd probably look like a giant tool. But, you could probably get away with a nice used Gallardo in the suburbs for way less money and actually feel alright driving it around on the weekends.

Yeah I'm definitely getting a new bank.

Why are you answering questions with authority when you don't know the very basics?

It sounds more like he refused to consider trying to understand it, which isn't "smart". Bitcoin isn't that hard to understand if you spend an hour or two reading about it online.

It's apparently much easier to buy btc and hodl. Not everyone getting in is interested in betting on new cryptos just in case.

I can't believe laugh tracks still exist.

Thank you for the excellent explanation. How is the Lightning Network supposed to alleviate these things? That has me more confused than anything in crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:25:02
Just getting into crypto but "infinitely divisible" does not make sense to me. I thought BTC will top out at 21m coins and are divisible to 8 decimals, which would not make them "infinitely divisible".

"I've been busy" is a pretty common "I just couldn't be bothered to do it" excuse.
If you had been actually trying to buy since $2k you'd have a lot more btc right now.

The drops happen with Bitcoin already. It has always recovered.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:01:42
Serious question, why would you spend btc on such trivial things? I imagine you can afford jerky normally and USD isn't going to be rocketing in value like btc has been and will be for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:39:59
If you have small amount of btc, more than 1 full coin even, you should have a big ass safe in your house/apartment. They aren't that expensive.

Holding them won't be universal, not with millions of people involved.

Cashing out at a $57 gain is not investing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:56:57
People are spending BTC in exchange for USD. It's a commodity. You don't spend corn on services. Hopefully it'll become a useful currency (check out Zcash) one day though.

In this (I'm assuming) hypothetical situation, were your friends paying their mortgage off of gains from the stock with no ability to pay should the price slip, or did they lose the house because they lost their jobs? 
I understand wanting the peace of mind of being debt free but I also understand the concept of not getting in way over your head unnecessarily. Seems you've described the very extreme opposite to OP's situation.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:55:35
I bought for the first time recently with the intention of investing in 
 BTC as savings. Seems like a good way to go vs. watching everything everyday and stressing about it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:04:52
Yeah I'm new to Bitcoin and really hoping for a heavy crash to buy more.

This is why you don't buy the biggest mansion in the neighborhood on stock options.

What about the guy that received the coins? Anyone been in contact since?
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:42:11
Pure, unadulterated bullshit.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:42:10
Damn dude. Just do a little reading. I understand people want to be helpful but you said you wanted to buy bitcoin at 2k but couldn't until someone basically held your hand through it.
Investing isn't having people hold your hand all the way. You have to put in the effort.

Exchange != Bank
It's possible regulated crypto banks could show up in the future, and I would be surprised if they didn't, but calling GDAX a bank would be like calling Ameritrade a bank. The safest place to keep crypto right now is either in a hardware or paper wallet in a safe deposit box, aka, in an actual bank.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:55:16
You only use exchanges for trading. Keeping large amounts of crypto on an exchange is universally considered a bad idea. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:22:32
I have an account with Wells Fargo and no where do I see the ability to do any kind of trading. 
I would agree that exchanges are financial institutions but until bittrex is willing to send me a debit card, pay me interest on my balance, or give me a loan to buy a house, I don't view them as banks. 
If anything crypto exchanges are more closely akin to forex, not stock trading like I said in my other comment.
