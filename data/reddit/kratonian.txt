Oh, I thought It was older versions or something. I have a password anyways. But I just dl'ed 3.0.5 
Do you have any idea how I set up a segwit wallet? and how would I transfer my funds to it? would there be fees for that?
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:35:11
Can I use SegWit with electrum? if so, how?
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:45:29
So I checked and im running electrum 3.0.1, but I have no idea how to do a segwit transaction, where would I get started?
Also, Could I use segwit to transfer my existing funds? Or do I have to make a new wallet? and if I make a new wallet can I get the pre existing funds that I have on there somehow without fees?

You're welcome, glad I could help.
is it possible they could think I'm trying to scam and close my account? Should I move my funds just in case?

hah, fail. damn you had to type in that whole address? haha I could've copied it for you

Hes banned from this sub, but obviously that's not stopping him. I just reported him to admins, but I suggest others do the same, so that they see it and take action faster.

I have an account with gdax but never got around to using it. also have an electrum wallet.
ok so right now I'm trying to move $100 from coinbase to binance so I can some another altcoin, but no matter what address or amount I put, it shows a $17.00 network fee, can I somehow avoid these fees using gdax as well? is the $17 network fee just coinbase, or is it the same for any exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:24:34
this is him. if you look at his post history, its obvious hes scammed a few people or has at least been trying to, for the past few month. I hate scammers
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:16:19
Surely he should, I guess reddit admins don't take this seriously or are too busy
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:08:12
I know it will. what I'm asking is can coinbase ban people over stuff like this?
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:15:05
lol I figured someone would ask. no, I don't. I'm browsing reddit on 2 diff. accounts at the same time, one on chrome one on edge
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:13:02
Ok then, cool. thanks
I would move my coins, but the network fee is insane
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:53:33
anyways it doesn't matter because there is no way to reverse it. Can they freeze peoples accounts over stuff like this? should I move my funds out
