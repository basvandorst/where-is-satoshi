1. The odds of doing this are astronomical, but if your paranoid like me, thats why you check on blockchain.info first to verify that the account is empty.
2. I'm not 100% sure but i think the wallet always existed, i defer to someone more knowledgeable.

Hehe, you are correct sir.  It is a bit long isn't it!  I just wanted to make sure i left NOTHING out, and thats why it's a bit lengthy.  It's written for someone with no experience with bitcoin, but enough experience to print a file, burn a cd or order something online.
When i went through this process i DID NOT know that you had to import then entire offline cold wallet otherwise the remaining balance may be lost.  I read ALOT about bitcoin and didn't come across this important fact.  Those are the kind of points I wanted to include.
The truth is that right now, obtaining bitcoin and putting it into offline cold storage for the average person is not that easy.  However, now that i have it down(took me a few hours to get the process), I could go through the process of getting btc and moving it offline from start to finish in probably 20 minutes.  if I already had a bunch of addresses(public/private keys) made offline ready for importing coins into, I could do it in just a few minutes.  That's why I say when people go thorugh this process, they should make a bunch of printed keys so they don't have to do it again for a long time.

Bitcoin is about decentralization of power, banks are about centralizing power.   Formal bitcoin banks would create a target for the gubmint to shut down and also a centralization of power in the network which is what bitcoin is trying not to do.

You use the private key to import your offline private wallet into an online wallet.  I have only ever used a private key to import my offline wallet. I have never used a private key to send money to anyone with any of the online services like coinbase/localbitcoins/blockchain.info, those services seem to do everything automatically because at the time of import your logged into that account, so once the funds are in the online wallet and your logged in-then all you have to do is select the amount of btc to send and send it.

Its my paranoid nature i guess, its the same idea as not putting all your gold in one place.

From what i understand, wallets are created with SHA256 encryption, this is the same no matter what progam your using.
You can type the public address of a wallet created offline into the blockchain.info searchbar to verify it exists.
If it does not exist, it will return an error, but i gurantee that will not happen if you follow my directions.

Not a fan of centralization, but i don't mind if it is naturally from the market-not from government force or government force joined with corporate force(fascism).
Naturally some centralization will occur in a market as competition promotes those who provide the best service/product, but it wouldn't be like it is today with just a few giant corporations.  Corporations are direct legal creations of the state.
