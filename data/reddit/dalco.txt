It has a very good chance of getting overtaken when people no longer need to buy BTC to trade in alts.

You get it. It's about diversifying your altcoin holdings. Of course you may lose money in you put ALL of your money into one altcoin A diviersified and balanced portfolio is key.

Impossible for more companies to accept bitcoin when bitcoin fees are $15 - $20.

One key difference you are missing with bitcoin is that deflation is treated like capital gains. 
It's not fiat.

Let me ask you something: 
Is there literally any other reason to invest in BTC? The volitility has actually hurt the adoption. 
If you want to invest in technology with proven adoption, buy some ETR. The only reason to buy BTC is as an investment right now.

Just today one account spiked btc 1k and when it dumped it crashed down to 15k. Pumping and dumping happens.

Its correcting right now. Who knows when it will recover, could be any minute, could be another day. If I were you I would set a pricepoint you are OK with and buy if it hits that pricepoint. Sub 15k would be a very good deal. Sub 16k is also a good deal. 
Now that it is has hit 19k historically, it is somewhat likely that it gets valued at that again in the near future.

It's too volitile to adopt for companies. Look at what happened yesterday, crazy surges that were capped by someone moving the market millions of dollars by buying 7,000 btc and then crashing the momentum by dumping it all instantly. 
If I was an established company the prospect of keeping my profits in such an unstable currency (that can literally lose thousands of dollars per coin in a minute) would be fucking terrifying. I don't blame them.

Ha! Yea, beanie babies and baseball cards. It's a similar phenom I think. Collectibles are ONLy valuable during their fad. years later, most that stuff is worthless. 
This stuff with BTC is crazy man. Everyone thinks the coin is going to 100x again in 5 years without any bubble popping. People are going to get hurt.

I hold bitcoin and he is not wrong. You need major adoption by commercial interests for a currency to work.  If bitcoin can rise 50x in a year you can bet your ass it can drop like a stone even faster.

Why would a business ever adopt bitcoin? It's too volitile.

Cypto will never work in a society where smart phones are still a luxury item. And there are several areas of the US (think RGV) where this is still a reality.  Not to mention the rest of the world.

You can say it's false, but go walk through a [Colonia in Hidalgo County]( and tell me bitcoin will work for those people. It won't. They 100% rely on cash. Many of the poorer, rural areas in America do. 
Until you can find a way to bring EVERY citizen along, it won't replace fiat.  
And "massive shifts", what?  Venezula is only considering adopting it because hyper inflation is destroying their currency. Hyperbole much?
