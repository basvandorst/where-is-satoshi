Yup, it's a shit deal. The only usefulness of it is to quickly buy dips that then turn around quickly.

What about things like Revolut?

I cannot claim to be a bitcoin expert by any means. I've read the white paper, a couple of books (on the technology, I have little interest in the economics), and moved on to other explorations.
Still, allow me some counterpoint, and do correct me if I'm wrong.
Bitcoin's distributed nature relies on collective agreement as to the history of each individual fraction of bitcoin. This agreement is enforced through a democratic principle of majority voting, where votes are processing power (simplified for the sake of brevity).
If the majority of these votes lie on a region controlled by a totalitarian regime *known* for its undue grasp on its people's technological freedoms, how can we expect bitcoin to be immune?

You (and others who advocate this point) seem to forget that at this point a very substantial fraction, probably the majority, of processing power dedicated to mining is in China. I don't see how using a currency that is becoming more and more the domain of a totalitarian state puts everyone on a level playing field.
Don't get me wrong, I love bitcoin and its concept, but also increasingly believe that this execution based on "who can afford to have the most miners" might be fundamentally flawed.

There's quite an echo here.

A phenomenon that would be worsened in exactly the same way if he were burning gas.
The solution is more efficient houses, not being cold.

Thanks for clarifying!
