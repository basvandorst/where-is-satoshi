Are you kidding me... I know it's cliche to say, but fuck the U.S. government. We don't need the nanny state anymore.

Yeah, but, I've quadrupled my money twice... NEO and LISK. 
Ignored the "Bitcoin is a scam." and profited.
Ignoring the "ICOs are a scam." and profiting.
This article sounds a lot like someone telling you not to buy Bitcoin in 2012.

I was talking to family about how Bitcoin is deflationary, but damn have we really lost 4 million to bad hard drives and lost codes! If so, awesome.

I think we will see it one more time at $4,500, very briefly, during the next FUD crash.
Mid November:
[Insert any country here] will ban Bitcoin.
[Insert any banker here] will denounce Bitcoin.
[Insert any tech site here] will spread fear about the fork.
It will "crash" to $4,500 for a day then recover immediately.

I didn't buy when China banned Bitcoin. I don't know why you assume that.

ANTIFA is proof of that. However you could argue that the youth are so violently misled due to the decimated economy and 20 trillion in debt left to them.

When Bitcoin Seg Wit activates. That uncertainty is driving the market down. As soon as segwit kicks in (or the chain splits which is unlikely) I'm buying hard.

Damnit no! I need more time to invest!
Happy for Bitcoin, sad I don't have more assets to sell.

It could split for sure. I don't think it will. That looks messy to the average buyer, it devalues the long term prospects of Bitcoin. It devalues the product the miners are trying to aquire in the first place.
I think they're just trying to eek out as much profit before the August 1st deadline. Mexican standoff. My gut tells me they give in to segwit.
We shall see =]

This is like waiting for Christmas morning, but for adults.
