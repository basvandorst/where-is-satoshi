Might want to do another UI pass.

Then just trade BTC for Crypto-USD straight exchange. I see no issue.

Could happen, but so what? That wouldn't make your Bitcoin worthless. Simply exchange BTC for CryptoUSD (or whatever) the same way you would with most other alt coins.

Probably a little of both, it's surely an automated process. If you buy using GDAX, your USD/crypto money is stored on GDAX. But you can easily transfer to your Coinbase wallets.

Doesn't surprise me. If the price goes up, it's in Coinbase's interest to  sell to you at the higher rate because it's still market value and they pocket the difference. If the price goes down, but they have a stockpiles of coins they purchased at  a higher rate, they'll  likely just sell you at the rate they purchased so they don't  lose any money. In this way Coinbase is making money hand over foot.
You can use GDAX or another site like Tradingview to verify you're getting the market rate.

Makes sense to me. If I trade $ for €, should I pay tax in ¥?
If I trade BTC for ETH, should I pay tax in USD?

Lot of questions on how GDAX works. GDAX stands for Global Digital Asset Exchange, it's an online coin exchange where buy and sell orders are posted and filled in real time. If you have a Coinbase account, you can setup a GDAX account and move money over right away - both services are owned by Coinbase (the company).
Open these in two different tabs and you'll notice the prices are different - Coinbase prices typically lag the real-time price. Coinbase buys set amounts of cryptos at the market rate at regular intervals (probably using GDAX), then offers that price to users for a fee. 
That fee is convenience - so example - I can buy BTC at, let's say $4300 on Coinbase when the market price at that exact moment on GDAX is $4335, and I can do it with a bank account I just linked. Coinbase let's me reserve that BTC at the $4300 price, but it doesn't actually place the currency in my account until the money transfer from my bank clears after a few days. So while I may have paid those fees, I also locked down BTC at a set price when I didn't have any money in my account.
When you use Coinbase you are effectively buying/selling crypto with Coinbase. With GDAX, you are using Coinbase's exchange to buy/sell with other individuals.

Dollar Cost Averaging is the way to go. Invest smaller amounts over time, sometime you win and sometimes you lose but just have the patience and keep your eye on the market. Solid strategy.

So what exchanges are ready to allow people to buy/sell BCC on 8/1?
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:54:19
So if GDAX is an exchange, Coinbase is a brokerage?

Literally no different from gifting someone stock. Could lose a bunch of money that way too.

Also a new guy getting started with Coinbase... they've claimed that my cryptocurrency funds are insured, is that not the case?

Coinbase appears to be insured against hacks:
