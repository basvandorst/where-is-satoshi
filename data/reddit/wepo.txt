OK.  So I'm sure no one holding bitcoin futures contracts owns bitcoins.  Good point!

That tweet did not look to me to be a reliable source.  Are they really spamming 100 100 100, on an account named Rekt?  
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:47:12
OMG no way you'll follow through on that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:56:47
Approximately when would the expiry of the first futures contracts occur?  
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:11:21
It also says 100 100 100 100 100 100, etc, on an account named Rekt.  I didn't think that would be a reliable source.  Apparently I was mistaken.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:02:46
Exactly.  It probably has 30day expiry and  then on that day he’ll drop 20k bitcoins on the market.   And then make a snarky reply to that tweet. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:45:22
What would you guess bitcoin drops to in the next week?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:59:03
Yeah, actually and technically it does and did hit 19k.   But I also agree this is not the dip too. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:59:46
I'm guessing he wanted to sell?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:56:56
Yes it does.  The same guys buying futures have ton of bitcoin.  That is a direct connection. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:43:38
It hit 19k in USD on gdax.  Over 19.5k to be accurate.  But it was momentary.  Volume skyrocketed and site became sluggish/unusable.

Bitcoin is naturally going down from large bag holding whales selling out.  But the good news is that those bags are finite and eventually we will see the end of this negative price pressure.

@_date: 2019-10-26 02:52:01
Yeah, if anything this $3000 spike in 9 hours after weeks of constant downtrend should make it crystal clear that nothing is certain with btc.
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:41:16
Yeah, I'm a traditional bull for btc but seeing weakness that indicates sideways or downward movement for foreseeable future.  I cashed out  well in the black but hoping we're wrong for the hodlers.

It feels like I'm in WSB.
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:26:10
The vast majority of BTC market moves are due to whales (and their timed buys/sells).   It's not news cycles or TA or anything else people blame/credit price movements on.  
The only 2 things TA is good for (as far as BTC) is being aware of the general price trend and knowing that everything else in TA can often lend itself to being a self-fulfilling prophecy.
The key here is you will never learn enough to know when a whale is going to dump on the market.   Or cause it to spike.   One other thing to keep in mind - whales want to make money too.   But also consider they can make money shorting BTC as well.
I sold out a few months ago and was going to take a break but I am looking at jumping back in if price gets to $5k-$6k.
@_date: 2019-10-08 20:10:34
You literally said "Creating a high-quality fake is SUPER easy".  Then you change argument to say it's how you spend them.  I'm not even going to argue with you since you can't stick to one argument.

@_date: 2019-08-28 20:08:29
You're asking the right questions.  Whales are the primary reason for price movement.  People always associate ups/downs with recent news or events but it's all 100% BS.  It's always a whale behind big price moves.  Always.
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:05:00

I looked into Robinhood:
1.  It's great until you want to cash out - a LOT of people seem to be having problems getting their money out.  Check google and BBB.
2.  Their customer support is terrible.  Hope you don't have a problem!
3.  They hide their fees in the purchase price of the stocks you buy.
They are very sketchy and wouldn't use them if they were the last option available.

Does anyone know if the mt gox trustee's have finished selling from their account?  I think it will continue to be a bumpy ride until then.  Of course, they may be done (hopefully).
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:36:45
Huh, there were verified links to the actual trustee accounts on this very forum after Dec 18 that showed a large amount of BTC left to sell.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:02:24
I’m fine. I’m not the one who doesn’t understand reality of the situation. I’ve been trying to participate in ICOs so I know what I’m talking about. You should try it. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:42:42
99% of coins/tokens are considered securities per SEC.  They are 100% banned. If they weren't, the ICOs themselves would not prevent US citizens from joining their ICOs.  I would show you screen shots of ICO's denying access to anyone from US or China but you already know that this is the case and are just arguing for the sake of it.  The only recent exceptions are BLT and GEMs.  They took great pains to paint themselves as pure utility tokens but everyone knows they are not.  And there are 100s of ICOs that did not allow US participation due to the U.S. SEC BAN.
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:36:47
Eh, I think these explanations aren't really helpful nor accurate.  People are more complex than he is giving them credit for with this summary.

They caused the crash.  And most major price dumps since then.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:25:51
Yeah, we Americans are way too stupid to manage our own money.
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:53:10
When you are talking about 160k BTCs, there is no way it doesn't effect the market price.  I mean, you can believe that but buyers will also be sellers into the open market 100%
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:53:51
Apologies if I misunderstood.  They caused the crash.  But they also have more to sell too.  Editing my comment to be less aggressive.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:49:58
I repeat, you are completely wrong.  I have proven it here with context and links.  Please spend more time making pedantic arguments because 1% of ICO's hard sell themselves as a 100% utility token.  End of debate.
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:46:27
Not sure how one would know that, be 100% assured of that and even if that is true, it will still effect price.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:47:36
"Some".   Aren't you rich.  Shall we have a name off of all the ICO's that I, as a U.S. citizen could participate in vs those that denied me in the last year?   If you can find 10% of the ICO coins that make your point than I can for mine, you win.  Which would indicate that for all practical purposes they are banned. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:45:40
"If anyone is selling these securities to U.S. citizens, you will get in trouble with the SEC for sure,"
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:13:04
Quit trolling or educate yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:43:28
Yeah, I guess you weren't aware that they have already banned them in the U.S.  So not sure how your point is even remotely relevant.
@_date: 2019-09-30 20:46:05
It ain't much but it's honest work.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:38:59
I think he means, most who would consider TA to be reliable (I don't), think the next tier of support is at 7,500.00.  
But it's B.S.  Whales move the market, the charts only work when retrofitting moves.  Full disclosure, I sold out of all crypto about a month ago and made a pretty penny or two.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:56:56
Thank you.  Partly luck, partly intuition and experience.  And maybe.  But it will have to get pretty bloody for me to get back in the water again.
@_date: 2011-06-21 19:29:22
You appear to be assuming that MtGox would only use this 500k account strictly for accruing transaction fees accumulated on MtGox?  Why would you assume that out of curiosity?  Why not consider that Mark had a significant stash as an early bird as well?  Or they played in the same market they were making?  
The reality is neither of us know exactly what happened yet.  But MtGox has made too many contradictory and disproved statements up to this point to believe anything they have to say on the matter IMHO.
@_date: 2011-06-21 06:42:38
I agree completely with your first sentence.  That almost reads like a mea culpa in that it does so little to refute his many valid points.  He could be in on it, it doesn't make his very relevant points any less valid.
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:39:23
To hold their BTCs in?  How do you suggest they store BTCs with no account?   You do realize the ability to place orders and withdraw BTC were built in to the website?
So you think some early founder, who had 500k (~$8.5 million USD) on only one account also was stupid enough to leave it all liquid in MtGox?
Lastly, many users have recently complained of hacking inside MtGox.  MtGox has blamed it on the users security and not reversed any transactions except when it happened to them.   
"Useless and stupid", indeed.
@_date: 2011-06-22 17:35:20
How so?  It's my understanding they are located in Chile?  That could be incorrect as I just read it on a forum. 
Is there an international agreement among all countries about security testing of websites with no ill intent?

While I agree with the other comment about the audio issues, this was a good interview with the TH guys.
I hope we see a third party security audit from TH soon.
Thanks for posting this!
@_date: 2011-06-21 06:56:06
Very good example.  I can't really believe MtGox would think that response would help them in any way. 
With the number of people following BTC now, of course there are plenty of people watching the market, and some would surely jump at the chance to buy cheap.  
We need a market with some stability and integrity here.  Not this "no reversing trades due to hacking unless it's our BTC's that were hacked" crap. 
If Tradehill hadn't spammed their referral codes I would be on them right now.  But now I'm just going to wait and see.  I don't feel any of them are trustworthy.
@_date: 2011-06-21 23:59:45
I understand how it works.
Why would they have their own account?  Why wouldn't they? I don't understand why think think it is natural for them to not have their own account and transfer that to/from their wallet like it is done for everyone else.  It would be the simplest method and based on their failures in website security, I'd suggest quite likely.
You seem to be either making some serious assumptions or have inside knowledge (without which is nothing more than the rest of us are doing=speculating). 
@_date: 2011-08-31 20:54:01
Wow.  Everyone thought they were trying to find some elusive conman in some remote country and he was hiding in plain sight the whole time?  Even stating he was a victim as well? 
@_date: 2011-06-22 18:55:18
Good point.  Just trying to assess where my risks are and at what levels to determine if, how much, when and where to commit.
Thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2011-06-21 06:40:16
We don't know exactly what has happened.  MtGox claims several accounts were hacked.  But from evidence posted so far, it seems it was one large account that sold most of the BTC that caused the crash, which could very well be MtGox's due to the amount of BTC's sold and percent of total BTC's in circulation it contained.  
If that is the case, MtGox has been consistent in not reversing transactions that were due to hacking in many smaller instances noted on the forums in the past.  But apparently in this case, they decided to reverse it because it is their BTC that was hacked.
While "Kevin" could easily be in on it, he brings up some valid points that MtGox needs to address better than "Kevin logged in and bought coins around the same time the market crashed".
@_date: 2011-06-22 18:43:33
Thank you for sharing this information.  
I am anxious to fund an account but this kind of information is what I needed to hear to make a responsible decision.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:34:07
Wise point of view.  In my opinion, I did not give BCH much of a chance due to Ver's toxicity.  But didn't completely write it off either in spite of his immaturity.  He doesn't realize it but he not only hurts and hinders BCH, but all of crypto.
@_date: 2011-06-22 17:37:03
Thank you for sharing what you know of Tradehill and your wise advice.  While that was pretty much my plan, in this atmosphere it can't be repeated enough IMHO. 
@_date: 2011-06-21 09:26:36
From what I've read, it was mtgox account that sold the BTC.  Its no different than if your account was hacked and hacker transfered the funds to himself. Except of course, mtgox won't reverse it when its yours. 
@_date: 2011-06-23 13:41:01
They waited long enough to do this.  It's great that they have them, but they lost much trust waiting this long to prove they still had control.

This is great news!  But there's no chance I'm given AT&amp;T my future gains!  But adoption is obviously great!
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:57:28
Of course it does.  The world does not operate on bitcoin (yet).  At some point you have to exchange btc and fiat or vice versa.  
And even if you avoid ever exchanging into fiat, it is very difficult to hide your tracks using only bitcoin.  If you don't believe that is the case, you aren't aware of state sponsored tools that allow for that.
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:53:00
If one party accidentally deposits money in another party's bank account - that money can and will be reversed by nearly every country in the world.  This is not the bank making the mistake.  This is a private party transaction using banks only as a medium.  Their "custodial" position has nothing to do with it.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:09:10
So break it down for us.  Presuming Trump's debt is fixed amounts with fixed interest and his income (dividends, rent, etc) increase to follow inflation - how is the guy you replied to wrong?

I see.  My reply was kind of tongue-in-cheek, of course you are right.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:47:33
Bitcoin isn't solving this or we wouldn't have this thread.  
This is exactly my point in the other thread we were arguing in.  Bitcoin can't avoid the law no matter how much you want to talk about custodial services.

The law is what is essential.

Let me give you another example.  I intend to buy your car for 1,000.00.  But I accidentally give you 10,000.00 and can prove it (blockchain).  If the contract is presented to the judge with the proof of over payment, I will win this case most of the time and will be able to garnish your sources of income.
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:12:20

I am a long time proponent and supporter of bitcoin, I understand it very well.  I just want those that are newer to crypto to understand it's weaknesses as well as it's strengths.  
For example, it is harder to track US dollar transactions than it is bitcoin in many cases (due to the ledger), but many people think bitcoin is quasi-anonymous.  It is not. 
I agree with most of your reply except it being a "lot harder" for government to seize your crypto vs cash.  If you don't mind going to prison for a long time, then you are correct.  But if you are facing contempt of court and don't want to go to jail, providing the keys seems like a good option.
I will say that using some crypto like XMR, in conjunction with proxi's, tor and burner wifi spots can make your transactions pretty close to anonymous.  But how many people really go that far?
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:02:02
There are a million variations of this "accidental deposit" scenario.  The parties are identified in this case and it is easy enough to prove that this was accidental.

@_date: 2019-05-23 22:41:27

@_date: 2019-05-22 13:20:44
Actually, if a bank incorrectly deposits money in your account, it is not yours and there is law and legal precedent to back that up so not sure OP is totally out of luck.
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:59:59
You are the one who doesn't seem to understand how the real world works with bitcoin in it.  Bitcoin transactions are not above the law.  They are actually easier to enforce than cash transactions.  Educate yourself.
