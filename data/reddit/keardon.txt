That’s what I get for using Siri’s typing.

Why is Zelle so essential for you?

“Siri, take le shit.”

High trait openness is not common. Most wont comprehend nonlinear concepts.

It’s apparent they are waiting on regulation before opening up all methods of trading. 
It’ll be interesting to see as we progress towards decentralized exchanges. Along with Fidelity’s investment into a digital exchange I can’t help but laugh at people who doubt the movement though. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:41:12
Baby steps. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:51:36
Large brokers like Fidelity and exchanges like Nasdaq can finally have accurate real time data for evidence to use that will finally give us regulatory transparency.

You have to try it to see. The only constant in this life is change.

In order to reach the utopia that Satoshi envisioned we will have to synergize crypto and government. You can’t expect the world to accept anarchy all at once.
@_date: 2019-04-18 21:00:56
Propaganda? This is real world adoption which obviously involves governments whether you like it or not.

How is that different from tokenomics?

Quote me anything that involves him taking over the money supply. He’s all about using the money we currently have in different ways. Reallocating the entire budget almost.
@_date: 2019-04-18 21:01:05
Long game.
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:09:37
Why do you assume that?
The only reason that assets were managed before is because there was no way to have instantaneous communication that was reliable and the difficultly to maneuver around the finances and regulations that come with owning a property. With the blockchain all of that difficulty disappears. With the advent of smart contracts and artificial intelligence we will no longer have to worry about such trivial tasks. Management will be the first thing to go in the near future with  these capabilities. That statement applies to any trivia task ie; healthcare administration, paralegals, accountants, etc.

Gurllll no way! ��

What’s the time zone?
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:32:55
That’s because the digital infrastructure is already there. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:43:51
This is a grassroots movement and should be treated as such. 
We must show them the way. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:49:47
I said AI marketing and hiring. In the hiring process a smart contract would be used to facilitate said hiring. Naturally. 
May I ask what you think is so delusional? Do you think that these situations are out of our technical abilities or do you think it has to do with the sociological acceptance of it all?
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:34:50
Wait for the American Oil Coin. Juuuuge.

May Satoshi be with you.

Many decentralized exchanges will surface this year. Waves has a head start. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:41:14
So instead of a corporation holding building rights for the investor you can now bypass them and buy pieces for property with millions of others. Fuck yeah. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:59:26
Say it with me... Capitulation.

I’m guessing you are unaware of the capabilities of smart contracts. This is why blockchain is so revolutionary. 
Rent - SC
Hiring - SC and AI
Rent - SC
Evict - SC
Marketing - AI
Lawyer = SC
Payment - SC
Bank = Cryptocurrency account. 
Most of your questions actually ask the same thing like rent, payment, evictions and lawyers. Smart contracts will be very rough on the legal side because all delegation will be done by the contract itself. 
The ones I posted for AI will undoubtably be done by people at first but the overall progression will end up as stated. 
Judging from your last remark it appears as if you think this future is far off but if you spend some time researching artificial intelligence and automation you’d realize that 30% of jobs will have been eliminated by 2025.

What exactly are they hacking? Are you assuming that they are going to hold these tokens in an open exchange? Since it’s property I don’t see why they would do that because when buying property it’s a long term investment which means cold storage no?
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:08:24
Can anyone explain why we look at a single asset rather than the consensus?

I believe we are arguing the same point but with different timeframes.

We all know most of the altcoins will die off. But those that survive will change the world.

Once medical surveying accessories improve the daily routine will make you money as it provides data for just living. It’s not that the blockchain will save us. It’s the combination of many different advancements made in the last decade. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:11:11
I absolutely agree. All cellular devices are finely tuned instruments of surveillance built to know and record your every move. This technology gives us the ability to do amazing things but most people don’t recognize the danger inherent to owning these devices. 
I do believe that the advent of blockchain technology will give us the ability to monetize our personal statistical data. Thus providing a physical support to the concept of universal basic income. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:47:03
No, all debts have been paid.

IoT will change that. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 04:47:51
Through the tokenization of user interaction we will be able to effectively make standard income just by living and interacting with society. We already have Steemit and we will have social media’s like on the blockchain that will allow for said usability.

As the technology progresses the consumption of energy will become irrelevant as we progress to renewables. 
The transition from silicon to carbon will also nullify the processing problem. 
I recognize that the evolution of a certain tech isn’t a good representation but my point was the convergence of all these technologies will bring forth the future.
