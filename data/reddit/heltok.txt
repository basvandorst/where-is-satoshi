If you send a small transaction, the network might consider it as spam. Thus you should add a small fee, of like 0.0002BTC, then the miners will likely decide to include it in the next block. If you send a larger sum like 0.01BTC+, it is unlikely that it is spam and the miners will likely include it even without a fee, but maybe not in the next block. If you send a large sum like 1BTC+ miners will think it is not spam and include it fast. For a more detailed explanation of how most miners decide on which transactions to include read this:

True, there were also some whale trying to change the outcome of the election by betting big on the republicans, he lost $100k+ in EV and the odds were only off for a few seconds. 
A decentralized no fee efficient market should make them lose EV much slower than todays market, in theory every bet should even money if you are just clicking buttons. And prediction markets generally have a much longer time between decision and reward so they are not as addictive as poker or slot-machines. So even though they will effect some people negative, them replacing the current addictions of today might be a big net win for the addicts.

People already have enough incentive, they like to consume. And if you delay your consumption someone else can buy the stuff you would have bought. And if nobody wants it then resources should have been used elsewhere. 
Inflation moves consumption from the people and stuff people want to the state and stuff people don't want.

Just live well, be nice to people, don't use violence to get your will through. When people force you to do things that you should be free to choose if you want to do or not, act confused, question it for a little and say that it seems weird but to as told. Most people need to hear that 7+ other people think differently before they actually consider the other opinion. The same with bitcoin, just say things like "i don't mind the euro, but I think people shouldn't be forced to use one currency" "people use bitcoin because they want to". The big battle will be won by winning many small battles and you are one of all our soldiers fighting the good cause every day!

Not really. Lets say I lend you $100 and want $2 in interest. But then we get 10% inflation. So now I want $12 interest to lend you money. 
What inflation did is to force you to pay off $10 extra every year. Maybe you would still do that without inflation, but without inflation you had the extra choice. And choices always have nonnegative expected value. Thus inflation always have a nonpositive expected value to the borrower.

All prices rise and fall. Bitcoin is very new and has been increasing in value from 1600BTC/USD to 1300USD/BTC in 5years so the prices has been extremely volatile and most likely will continue to be extremely volatile for some more time.

The idea is not legit. It has been tried by many countries and failed horribly every time. Speculation actually is good, it helps finding equilibrium faster. Bitcoin is great because of rampant speculation, do you think the price would have increased 1000000x in 5years without speculation? 
@_date: 2014-08-18 08:15:59

At least this part of the story. Sure there are likely many other stories affecting the price and some of them might be related to this.

If Bitcoin fails they might succeed and thats a good thing imo. If Bitcoin wins then they will pay dearly to the believers and thats a good thing. 
Sure some media attention for short term volatility might improve Bitcoin's chance of winning, but you can't get everything. As a BTC-hoarder I don't worry about the shorters, transactions are up
and I believe in the fundamental properties of Bitcoin. 
I have been thinking on lending some BTC to the shorters on bitfinex, but I don't really trust the site, is there some trustless shorting exchange?

Transformative Innovation
Because many of Silk Road’s customers were themselves drug dealers, the market functioned as the first virtual broker between illicit businesses. This eliminated many of the risks typically associated with the drug trade — including violent “turf wars” between rival groups, and theft of product or cash. Vendors now had a way to source and distribute product that kept them relatively safe in such a risky business.

Consider the following sequence of cases, which we shall call the Tale of the Slave, and imagine it is about you.
1.	There is a slave completely at the mercy of his brutal master's whims. He often is cruelly beaten, called out in the middle of the night, and so on.
2.	The master is kindlier and beats the slave only for stated infractions of his rules (not fulfilling the work quota, and so on). He gives the slave some free time.
3.	The master has a group of slaves, and he decides how things are to be allocated among them on nice grounds, taking into account their needs, merit, and so on.
4.	The master allows his slaves four days on their own and requires them to work only three days a week on his land. The rest of the time is their own.
5.	The master allows his slaves to go off and work in the city (or anywhere they wish) for wages. He requires only that they send back to him three-sevenths of their wages. He also retains the power to recall them to the plantation if some emergency threatens his land; and to raise or lower the three-sevenths amount required to be turned over to him. He further retains the right to restrict the slaves from participating in certain dangerous activities that threaten his financial return, for example, mountain climbing, cigarette smoking.
6.	The master allows all of his 10,000 slaves, except you, to vote, and the joint decision is made by all of them. There is open discussion, and so forth, among them, and they have the power to determine to what uses to put whatever percentage of your (and their) earnings they decide to take; what activities legitimately may be forbidden to you, and so on. Let us pause in this sequence of cases to take stock. If the master contracts this transfer of power so that he cannot withdraw it, you have a change of master. You now have 10,000 masters instead of just one; rather you have one 10,000-headed master. Perhaps the 10,000 even will be kindlier than the benevolent master in case 2. Still, they are your master. However, still more can be done. A kindly single master (as in case 2) might allow his slave(s) to speak up and try to persuade him to make a certain decision. The 10,000-headed monster can do this also. 
7.	Though still not having the vote, you are at liberty (and are given the right) to enter into the discussions of the 10,000, to try to persuade them to adopt various policies and to treat you and themselves in a certain way. They then go off to vote to decide upon policies covering the vast range of their powers.
8.	In appreciation of your useful contributions to discussion, the 10,000 allow you to vote if they are deadlocked; they commit themselves to this procedure. After the discussion you mark your vote on a slip of paper, and they go off and vote. In the eventuality that they divide evenly on some issue, 5,000 for and 5,000 against, they look at your ballot and count it in. This has never yet happened; they have never yet had occasion to open your ballot. (A single master also might commit himself to letting his slave decide any issue concerning him about which he, the master, was absolutely indifferent.)
9.	They throw your vote in with theirs. If they are exactly tied your vote carries the issue. Otherwise it makes no difference to the electoral outcome.
The question is: which transition from case 1 to case 9 made it no longer the tale of a slave?

Some people seem to argue that this story will hurt bitcoin. Imo it should not. The bots were responsible for both the rise and the fall, now the story is over. So we had an incident where a lot of people lost a lot of money, the major exchange is gone but still the price went from 100-&gt;560 in spite of this. This should show a lot of strength for bitcoin imo. Could be wrong and we might see big crash, but imo a rise is more likely. Future will tell :)

Double negation does not imply a positive statement. 
"Hur dur, you don't own an Apple product, therefore you have no right to criticize the iPhone."
You don't understand skin in the game. "Apple's stock is gonna crash because iPhone sucks!" If the economist saying that is not shorting Apple, then the advice means nothing. It doesn't mean it won't happen, just that the advice is not worth listening to. There may be some other technical advice that actually is worth listening to, but you don't ask an economist those.

"There is some illegal transaction value, but not actually that much. People buying like drugs, or worse. And then there is very little legitimate transaction. Russ: Correct. But there's some. Guest: Very little. Russ: Is it growing? Guest: That's the worst part, is that if you look at most of these estimated transaction volume things, which are notoriously hard to do, it at least does not appear to be undergoing runaway growth, as everyone has been predicting. And so I think the big challenge with BitCoin as a currency is, it still has not found what it's better at than other payment systems. And that's really important. Personally, I think the most promising green shoots are around international remittance. Sending money to my family in Mexico or whatever. And that seems to maybe be picking up real steam. But it's so early in the day the data's so noisy, it's hard to know for sure. So basically what I think about BitCoin is it's unbelievably interesting technology; it's one of these things that's lodged in my brain and won't go away; but I have been continually disappointed about the speed with which it has found real usage.

Later in life you will have more money than will make you happy. If you want to maximize your utility value and spend evenly all through life you should probably spend more than you think as young, save for the future can you do when you get your real job and you should save enough that you can life a comparable lifestyle when you retire. 
That being said, if you really believe in bitcoin as an once in a lifetime investment you should keep most of the bitcoins as an investment. When I was your age I really overvalued the value of having a car and undervalued the value of just living life.

I have been declined both debit and credit cards, even though I have other credit cards, money in the bank, no criminal record, own an apartment etc. Motivation: No taxable income. 
When I talk to the support it feels like: "You want my money right? You will make money from me with no risk to yourself. I can deposit all the credit you have to give me so you don't have to take the risk. Don't you like money?" But they just stonewall "you need a taxable income". Once I told them "If I deposit $1M with 2% interest rate at your bank, I will make $20k in taxable income. Will you then give me $1k credit?" and got the answer "Yeah, I guess that might work, but I will have to check first". No reaction for how stupid it is that I have to deposit 1000x more for security, it's like I need to park 1000cars outside the car rental company to rent one car.

You set your price, sellers decide if they are willing to accept it or not. It's made possible because the gift-card-trade using fiat is broken(because of fraud risks with fiat) so some can buy gift cards at 30% discount of their value. So instead of paying with fiat/bitcoin you pay someone else who uses a gift card to pay for your order. Also some people prefer this way of buying bitcoins instead of going through exchanges, because of capital controls that limit transfers to exchanges but not to amazon.

1. Go to 
2. Click on the first transaction you see
3. Click on the map
4. Read %Percent Of Network
5. Refresh(F5) and check again
About that probability it will have to end up confirmed unless the attacker is willing to risk a pretty large sum of bitcoins a failed attack will cost. So if the transaction is worth &lt;1BTC I would accept the risk of 0 confirmations. If the transaction is &gt;10BTC I would wait for 1confirmation &gt;100BTC 6confirmations.

Because it is nice to be able to send money to your friends and other people you want to support or transact with. With Bitcoin you can do this no matter who you are sending to, for cheap, fast and secure. With other alternatives you usually can't send to anyone, it is expensive, it takes time or it is not secure. Even your cat can have a Bitcoin wallet and send Bitcoins to your dog if it wanted to, try signing up your cat for a VISA-card... Or maybe you want to send money to Wikileaks, North Korea or some other group that some men in suits have decided that you can't send money to. And try sending money to africa without paying huge fees. Bitcoin solves this :)

Bitcoin isnt deflationary, it is disinflationary
Disinflation distinguished from deflation[edit]
If disinflation continues until the inflation rate is zero, the economy enters a deflationary period, with decreasing general prices on all goods and services produced. An example of this happened during the month of October 2008, when U.S. consumer prices fell (deflation) by 1.01% but the overall annual inflation rate simply decreased (disinflation) from an annual rate of 4.94% to 3.66%.[4] So the distinction between deflation and disinflation at that point was simply one of which time period was being referring to, the monthly basis or the annual basis. Over the year, prices were up 3.66% while over the month prices were down 1.01%.
Disinflation is reduction in the inflation rate.

All the points have been said before and so much is just plain wrong. 
"If someone came up with a virtual currency that people understood and whose value did not fluctuate as much"
Then it would not go from 0 to $500 in 5 years.
"“One of the biggest problems for bitcoins is people don’t understand how they are created and that’s not going to lead a lot of people to adopt it,” Lucas said."
Like they don't understand how dollars are created or how they don't understand the internet.

Assuming no upgrade to the protocol is done, I think this will happen:
Some transactions will take very very long time to confirm. If we assume that 1.1MB/block transactions are added to network, the average transaction time will grow 1min/block or 6min/h or 124min/day. So after a week some transactions which used to take 10min might take 14h. By then many will likely include a higher fee, for example instead of adding 0.001btc they might add 0.01btc and the 0.001btc transactions might take even longer. Eventually people will use other things instead of Bitcoin for some transactions.
This is a very important issue that I hope and think many talented coders are trying solve. So we should not overreact. But it is important that we talk about it so we are prepared if it happens before the solution is out.

Actually the classical meaning (latin inflare= blow into) is that money supply increases for example by gold being discovered. That is an increase in money supply. 
Not sure how your or my latter statement is relevant though. My point was that GDP does not count everything that affects price-inflation. If something becomes free GDP falls.

Imo argue your case. Ask for a meeting with the principal, be nice, say that you don't agree with their policy, ask that you get the chance to explain why. Then repeat their reasoning, say if that reasoning is valid teachers should not talk about dollars since most drugs are bought with dollars and that just because terrorists use shoes and airplanes is not a good reason to ban them. End by saying that even though you don't agree with them you will respect them while you are in school.

One problem with this viewpoint is that the ones who have it doesn't actually believe it. If they actually believed that Bitcoin would have a deflationary spiral with no trade happening and the value skyrocketing they should invest in it. Sure it might be bad for the economy, but on an individual level it is still a great investment. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:32:26
The graph might be a bit flawed. If you have a lot of bitcoin, you can send it for free back and forth between your accounts to generate trade, to pump the volume.

It was a lot of inflation starting from 0 going to 14M in 6years. Still Bitcoin managed to rise in price from $0.00000000000 to $240 which is pretty amazing imo. Not many "experts" believed that was possible 5 years ago.  


Nobody can print bitcoins, they are released in a fixed predefined way. However dollars are printed very fast thus one can expect the long term value of dollars to go down. The more a currency is used the higher its market cap should be. Since Bitcoin has a fixed supply one could expect the price of Bitcoin to increase if the usage of Bitcoin increased. If everyone switched from using violence backed currencies to Bitcoin with todays global GDP, a bitcoin would have approximately the same purchasing power as $5M has today.

For every user it is used differently. People tip here, buy computers, gamble, buy drugs and other things like people do with dollars. Except for the tipping here which the dollar doesn't support. 
Fluctuations comes from supply and demand like the price of the euro in dollars. Since Bitcoin has grown from 1300BTC= $1 to 1BTC = $240 in 5years its value has been extremely volatile. If Bitcoin gains wider adoption it seems likely that the volatility eventually will go down. But for now, don't risk more than you are willing to lose and enjoy the ride.

Yeah, neuro-typical people are sometimes called normies by aspies. Imo it's the people who assign negative associations to either of them who are ones doing harm. Nothing is wrong with being normie or aspie, but it can be important for us to understand one another so some harmful confusion can be avoided. 
As an aspie I was struggling with normies not understanding me and not understanding normies. Some people did consider me inferior being aspie, I did consider some people inferior being normies. But now I have learnt that we are just different, sometimes with different strengths and weaknesses, but most of these can be improved so that is the most important starting point.

First, Bitcoin is disinflationary, not deflationary. Second, the theory that people will spend less as they get richer is cute, but if you look around the world almost all data goes against it. For better or worse, people like spending and since people have finite long lives they have do it when they are still alive.

A wallet cant have negative amounts, that is correct!

No, they can still produce capital goods, just not spend money to consume the capital goods. According to the premise, which I don't believe in, people will work their ass off to earn that 1cent which will be worth even more in the future. 
It should be pretty obvious that the promise is misguided. People don't consume less as their money increases in value. If that was the case why would anyone consume today when they can invest in stocks which is pretty much equivalent to hoarding deflationary money.

Just skimmed it a bit. I think you put a bit to much explanatory power into the measure of volatility. It is just a measure for some data with very little Fisher information.

How well something scales when for example the number of transactions grows large. O(n) means that the CPU time for 1000 transactions will be roughly 1000 times that of 1 transaction. O(n^2) means that it will will be roughly 1M times. You want the thing inside the O to grow as slow as possible with increasing n, if it grows to fast it might not scale well enough for larger problems.

Depends on which cash you compare it to. Sealand dollars are not more liquid than Bitcoin for example. 


Circular argument. 


According to most people yes. But just because Apple has better branding doesn't make Apple computers better. 


In most countries you have to exchange first, the same can be said for Bitcoin. It's just fewer exchangers that has a system in place for Bitcoin.


They would be able to by using a third party taking care of the volatility. 


Yes I can. In fact many people in Poland had their loans pegged in Swiss Franc which rose 20% over night just two months ago. It happens.


You can take deposits and make loans using Bitcoin. The friction is pretty high atm but expect that to fall, soon you might be able to lend money to shorters for say 1-5%/year trustlessly. 


Deposit on bitfinex and lend it to some shorter. Or try:
Be very suspicious about sites like these. Bitcoin is still young so a lot of scams are happening. Not really sure if lending makes something a currency. Also saying that Bitcoin isn't a currency is like saying the internet isn't a fax machine. It's not a currency, but it can do what currencies does and much much more...

Still it is a very strong statement. An actual expert would add a few "likely" "imo" "it seems" etc to clarify that it isn't a fact. And the valuation fluctuation problem can be handled by a 3rd party for a fee. How large this fee would be hopefully we will find out, but I assume there will be a competitive market for it. And that is IF it is a problem. The euro is fluctuating and still people are using it, so it doesn't seem to be a deal breaker.

From what I have seen of the world, people tend to buy more things as they get more purchasing power. My guess is that the reason for this is that people like to buy things and that they know they have a finite time on earth so the longer they wait the higher the chance that they will die before they have spent all their purchasing power. I find your world view that people will buy less things as their purchasing power increases interesting. Care to elaborate on how you arrive to that position?

I have been trying to find one good bitcoin-skeptic arguer but have been very unimpressed by them all. 
Most seem to lack less understanding than just reading the first paragraph on wikipedia. Some have gotten the basics but their attacks on bitcoin seems like they have never argued the question before and they try random arguments that have been proven false like "you can't buy anything with bitcoins" or they just say something they havn't thought trough like "its deflationary and will only increase in value since everyone will just hoard it". A few people like Schiff have some decent arguments like "it lacks intrinsic value" which at least is correct but it could argue that the fact havn't stopped people from wanting to use/hoard bitcoins so far. Most telling is that these people very seldom have even tried to use Bitcoin once. They might have a store that accepts it, but they havn't tried to use it at least once. 
My bias-warning-system is giving me red alerts, but it seems very few people who actually understand Bitcoin and have discussed the topic with people who understand Bitcoin have negative views on Bitcoin. In fact, many people seem to start with negative views which becomes more and more positive the more they debate or try Bitcoin. 
I look forward to the day we get some good debates on the topic. I really need a sanity check and hear some good counter arguments. But so far, I havn't found any good ones :(

Yes it raises questions, but it doesn't disprove anything. 


We don't know the full picture, once we do we may or may not think it was a good strategy. JPV seems pretty confident that is a reasonable strategy saying he would have done the same. I hope we will get more information so we can decide for ourselves if we agree or not. But for now, we cannot tell if it was a good strategy or not.

What exactly are Bitcoins?
-Digital money
I know they are farmed and you need a strong graphics card but what exactly are you doing when mining?
-Graphic cards wont do it anymore, now it's all about ASICs. You hash SHA-256 that confirm transaction. If you don't understand that, then just ignore it. You don't need to understand anything more than that it works. 
Exactly how safe is SR? Can you order drugs anywhere in the world?
-Pretty safe. Yes, but if you order from other countries and the customs seizes your package you might have to do some explaining like "I didn't order this heroin, must have been my girlfriend's ex who wanted to mess with me". 
In general, what are the do's and don'ts in this "area"?
-Do whatever you like. Make sure your computer is safe, if you get hacked, they can steal all your bitcoins or worse. And keep a backup, if you lose your wallet, your coins are gone forever.

After like 1h of failing to explain it to the teacher he finally gave me the lowest score I could get and still pass, because he couldn't prove that I had cheated.

But then dollars would be worth 0BTC, so the price would be infinity. But you could buy stuff for 1BTC that would cost 3.5M USD today. 
This assumes that we have no productivity gains. Number of BTC minted today is 11M which would make that number:
75E12/(11070100)=6775006.54917 if the change to BTC happened over night. 
But the price is ultimately set by supply and demand. Maybe people would prefer to hoard bitcoins since they rise in value so fast or maybe the then superrich geeks who today own them would give them away to charity.

It depends on what other people would use their purchasing power for. If everyone else are destructive, then hoarding currency is bad. If other people are productive with resources, not using your purchasing today means that they can use your purchasing power today to be even more productive. Which means that when you use your purchasing power later you get value for it.
