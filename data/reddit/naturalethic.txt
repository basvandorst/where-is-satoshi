Better than being normal.  Edit:  Crazy is a perspective. Honesty is grounded in experience. He has an honesty to him. Because of that if you catch him in a lie he is done.  What if you catch the others in a lie?  Much teeth grinding.

He sold them the same way other dealers do at their market price in silver. Problem is he had them stamped $20 which is a nono. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:30:37
I'm pretty surprised they let him off after that. It sorta lends weight to the idea that these Feds think they're doing the right thing even if they aren't.

You're still missing the point.  Value is always subjective and requires a consciousness to motivate its physical component to act on it for it to have any bearing in the world.  What is the intrinsic value of a lake on a planet orbiting Regulus?

This is gonna be a lot more destructive than growing pot though, whoo boy, its great.  Transaction fees can compensate too.  Need to keep a lot of miners running though, it's important for everyone in the btc economy.

You are correct.  Bitcoins that don't exist cannot be spent.  You'd have to come up with some other scrip that was "backed" by bitcoin.  Promisary notes or IOU's e.g.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:18:29
The figure I enjoy thinking about is that there is one btc for every 950 oz of gold in the world.  If we can move the economy over to btc, from all the fiat bullshit government funny money, that means a lot of wealth.  It's a shift from the trend of stealing from the weak to feed the powerful.  It moves wealth from the ignorant to the informed.  It is the revolution, if it works.

A fiat inflationary bubble has nothing whatsoever to do with bitcoin, unless you look at it as a reverse bubble with regard to said fiat.  As in a pre-hyperinflationary period that causes wealth owners to jump ship into something *stable* which bitcoin is.  The supply and the security of bitcoin is unprecedented in human history.

Vernor Vinge once wrote a novel called A Deepness in the Sky where spacefaring humans came across an intelligent civilization in a pre-technological age.  They waited them out, via hibernation, until they developed global computer networks, then the humans infiltrated their networks secretly posing as other members of that race to effect advances in philosophy and algorithms.
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:48:39
By what reasoning?
@_date: 2013-04-04 07:49:55
It seems a lucky coincidence that so many people who don't understand at all how it works are willing to bet on it, at least a little.  And what a happy thing that they aren't going to be punished for their trust.  Time will vindicate them... It's goddamn built-in.  People are good. Love is real.  We shall flourish and the evil ones will weep for the old tools of tyranny are collapsing before their eyes.

Buy and hold.  It's the only way to be sure.

Everyone suddenly wants to be a day trader. First explain to them the long term merits of the system.
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:24:16
That is a solid fucking assessment
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:47:53
Millions. 1 coin to every 950 oz of gold.
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:18:37
That explains a lot.  I was wondering how miners chose the best fees.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:04:34
If bitcoin works, anyone holding even a single coin is going to be vaulted into the super rich.
@_date: 2013-04-04 07:01:02

@_date: 2013-04-04 06:10:55
There are 950 oz of gold in the world for every bitcoin, and bitcoin is better than gold.  When everyone catches up, owning one btc you'll be a pimp.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:00:16
Your second point is the best.  It indicates a substance beyond the price.

@_date: 2013-04-04 06:47:16
Perfect answer. If you're not a day trader, or in for the long haul, why are you even asking?  Long haul my friends.
@_date: 2013-04-04 07:09:21
Agree on all points.
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:34:39
Wouldn't the one timestamped earlier take prescendence?
@_date: 2013-04-04 04:35:09
There is currently about 950 oz of gold in the world per bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:12:13
Pretty neat for a place that used to sell magic the gathering cards
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:37:34
But the actual solution requires a specific combination of transactions, right?
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:44:06
I agree, and in that case spend your btc on goods and buy back the same amount of btc.
Edit: what we're trying to do here is move the economy to btc so dont buy shit fiat, don't be a day trader unless you know what the hell you're doing
