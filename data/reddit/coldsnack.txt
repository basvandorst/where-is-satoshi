True, but they are not actively invested so their opinion/actions doesn't affect the price as much as someone who is holding Bitcoin.

Yeah, though I think the average butter probably doesn't short considering the limited options.

The best way to contact Bitstamp is on their Facebook page. I got an answer within 2 hours. By email the response took 2 days.

Why does Bitstamp cost you $15 for a wire transfer? I didn't pay anything for the transfer.

Thanks guys. You're right, I need to research this some more, it's a whole new world to me.
Got my Bitstamp account verified yesterday, so I'm going to buy some. The best way to learn about Bitcoins is to have some in your own wallet!

Without people like you (using and spending them early on) Bitcoin would not have come to what it is today. Don't get too hard on yourself, you've contributed a lot to the growth of Bitcoin.
Thank you.

Going back up again, no worries.

That guy who bought a Lambo at 1BTC/1000$     got a hell of a good deal. 50% discount on a Lambo... Not bad.

This made me buy Bitcoins.

3/10, ok troll, made me reply. (2/10, if copy-paste)

High quality post. 5 stars.

To be honest, it's not a big deal. Took a picture of my passport, downloaded a PDF writer, and send the documents. The next day I was verified.
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:47:48
Kind of you, how much is it?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:04:41
Why did you make this thread?
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:11:56
It is not about the answer, it is about sending a message...
