I had a similar situation with Interac E-Transfer where the buyer reported the tx to their bank as fraudulent. I kept the money and they obviously kept their coins, but the email address I used to receive the money is like permanently blacklisted now - if someone tries to send money to it, it gets caught up in some fraud hold for a few days before going back to them. Kinda soured me on using localbitcoins entirely.

Sure, but we're talking a lot more than $1 for "low risk". Especially on these seemingly weekly spikes in congestion with 150k+ transactions in the mempool.

Don't be surprised, you're exchanging a highly reversible payment for an irreversible one. Not many companies will operate in that space without a ton of KYC checks and strict limits.
That said, there's CEX.io but I don't know if they will deal with you since I don't know if they follow those state regulations you mentioned. They also sell at a pretty big markup like Coinmama.

I'd recommend if you just want to learn, just use your GPU/CPU and mine Monero or another ASIC-resistant coin. That's a more user friendly entry point than ASIC mining which is largely dominated by huge farms of S9s that buy up new stock months in advance on Bitmain. You can build a pretty good GPU rig to profit on alt coins with readily available parts, or wait for Bitmain to restock and wait months... or buy an ASIC from a reseller at a 2-3x markup.

Not reasonable atm due to the risk it never gets confirmed and drops from mempool. Bitcoin is broken as a point of sale currency until lightning network unfortunately.

If they had a plan to announce the trading in advance, what makes you think there wouldn't be insider trading prior to that announcement? The news would move the BCash price so it's the same thing, they've got rot in the company that would look to profit on it either way.

No exchange will deal with PayPal because of the extremely high risk of fraud. Sounds like you already know where you can buy BTC with PayPal, localbitcoins is the only place I know and vendors there will require a lot of verification before they deal with you.

They rebranded as ChangeTip and then went out of business, but you can apparently still withdraw from  - try that.

Then you have the recovery phrase which you kept safe so you can restore your wallet. If you're buying a hardware wallet you probably aren't retarded.

Anyone can send btc to that address, it's just random dudes shitposting on the tx history with pennies.

I dunno specifically how OP did it, but I know sites like LocalBitcoins are p2p markets with ebay style feedback/reps where you can sell bitcoin, and PayPal seems like a popular option for selling (not buying).
