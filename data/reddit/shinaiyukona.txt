High transaction fees is the one for me. Never paid more than 333sats

Roughly 200GB. So you'll be busy for a hot minute, especially since its peer to peer on that download
I imagine stable internet is better than faster (once synced) 
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:51:00
Like you said, once its in mempool its golden.
Take the minimum 100sat/byte route. Fee problem solved.

Transaction fees are part of the blockchain system. They're used in order to process the transaction. When you swipe a debit card there's a fee involved too, but thats paid for by the merchant usually.
However, the "$25 fees" are not hard coded. If you say buy off coinbase, not saying you should because they're scum that doesn't understand batching, segwit, etc, but if you do you can send the bitcoin to gdax for free, and from there withdraw for free (they make plenty off coinbase convenience markup). Now the trick here is to not use a trash wallet. If you have a hard drive with 200+ free space you can download the bitcoin core wallet and later when you use it set a fee as low as a couple pennies. The high fees are a product of a program that determines the "best" fee to get the transaction processed as fast as possible. So if you're say, ordering something (like off Amazon, but appropriate merchant instead) and the product doesn't need to be here tomorrow, but maybe this weekend is acceptable, then thats an option.
Also, we're nearing lightning and atomic swaps, not tomorrow, not next month, but eventually, both of these can potentially do the same as above, but instantaneous instead of waiting for the block chain process. Bitcoin isn't usable in the current state for an impulse urgent buy, but if you're getting something without that urgency you can mitigate almost the entirety of that fee with a bit of patience

As for your rack theres a YouTube channel called "IMineBlocks" he showed a wooden frame he uses for his GPUs.
I personally have a shower rack from good will :)

Fuck whoever started "Bitcoin Core" I always get confused with the wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:24:00
Mining won't ever stop. Just the generation of new coins. After that all payouts will be given through fees.
Mining needs to continue for the processing of transactions
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:34:32
It already exists. Again, use a wallet where you can set your own fee. Think the lowest fee is 1000 Sat/byte in core wallet. And if you're sending to one address that should be 333sat total. Which at current value is 3¢ it'll just take awhile to process.

Nah because loose is two characters from Noose. This can be used for Sudoku after you lose your money.
Where as lose goes into nose and nosing your way out of money just doesn't have the same flair.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:55:22
Now I'm not saying they're all great, but I can assure you mine are in great condition and usable for gaming if anyone ever comes over and needs to borrow it. Maybe a bit of dusting needed, but if I were to sell them (I'm not) I'd probably offer some form of return agreement.

If I've learned anything, leaving your bitcoins in someone else's wallet is the fastest way to lose bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:51:49
About tree fiddy?
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:36:31
Time to dump that wallet. Core will only charge ~3¢...
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:07:49
Even when they lose 4700 Bitcoin, they still won.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:17:19
The fuck is tBTC?
Test coins?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:15:03
Just because its the most popular doesn't mean its the best.
Just use core that way you can control your fee instead of being forced to pay extortion. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:00:53
What if I'm talking about the wallet though? :(
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:56:56
You're only slightly wrong on A.
In the instance of Avalon ASICs, buying more than 1 is a bit more profitable, up to 20 that is. Only because of a minor addon fee for a controller though that in the grand scheme is uhh negligible.

As far as I'm aware Coinbase/GDAX has free internal transactions. I don't know about "instantly". But who's to say they're not partnered up now. CB could easily be the "investor" thats going to help NH pay back the lost funds from their hack earlier this month
But if NH is using CB as their wallet and just updates their site with owed values than true values kinda like how the site already functions with their "address" system. I see no way it's not possible to be instant/0 fees its all internal for them.

Watched it stay in the 14k realm?
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:18:17
There's a couple exchanges for Bitcoin and all other crypto currency. 
One of the most referred to is coinbase. 
You can use [this site]( to see what Bitcoin and other currencies are at compared to others. If you tap on markets it'll list out a ton of other exchanges, though usually there's only a couple and most listings are a conversion to another coin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:36:44
That's why I said it'd acknowledge it.
When you go to make a transfer, at some point in the block chain is a listing for it so yeah..
Anyways, not the focus. I should've just left it out
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:50:56
Well obviously, but it is versatile. I'm not suggesting for it to happen, but inquiring if that could ever happen if the devs chose to.
It is a shame that there's so many lost though

Depending on their location OP and others that want to do the same might be eligible for a tax write off/incentive for doing solar panels. Out here, if I were to get them last I saw was .38c/kwh. Up to a cap of course, but still. Between profit of the ASICs and tax write off, operations at night will still be cost effective if the panels provide most of the energy.
Also, solar panels function in overcast, rain and evenings. Just because it doesn't have line of sight doesn't mean it cant absorb thermal radiation

Couldn't we send a type of query out to every wallet and get a rough number~~, then recycle those that aren't back into the PoW at current rates and acknowledge paper/forgotten drives as they pop back up?~~ of "active" coins to get a better representation of potentially lost ones?
Edit: I'm asking if this could ever happen not that it should.
Asking a question shouldn't be turned into a lynch parade
Edit 2: I'm not fond of removing things so strike through should work. Everything after that is a new addition as of now
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:25:31
Alright, and I'm not suggesting it but asking if its ever a possibility. Even just a query for 'active' coins. If it is then that's something to always be on the lookout for in ANY fork.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:41:56
I'm more into spooning myself.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:37:24
I appreciate the information so far.
So for miners, do they get to write off the equipment, electricity, internet consumption too? So say someone spends 10k on all that starting in July and over the course of 5 months makes 20k, do they owe taxes on the profit 10k or the whole 20k revenue?
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:05:33
So, would it be smarter in your opinion to do the full thing in year one, sell the parts off on eBay or where ever else, and then to buy a new set to write off again for the coming year?
Edit: would you mind if I pm you my scenario to get some advice? I can order you a pizza :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:50:56
Holy hell. No. Again, I don't fucking want it I'm just asking if it could ever happen Jesus fuck you guys are dense at times.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:36:19
Prolonging PoW so uhh all miners would benefit? It wouldn't exactly dilute the coins you hold today, but the coins 5+ years from now, but by that point tx fees are the primary reward for miners anyways.
Anyways, if it were to happen it'd happen on a corrupted fork if ever.
