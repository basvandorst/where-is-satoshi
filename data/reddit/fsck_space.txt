Please be aware that unless something has changed in the last few months, your private keys are **unencrypted** in storage on your phone. The PIN number is just used to control access to the application and does nothing to protect your keys. Any failure that exposes the key file and it is game over man. 
I lost considerable funds this way on a rooted phone when using it to temporarily get funds out of a crashing exchange when I didn't have access to my main wallet. Keys had been stolen (possibily by a bitcoin ticker app also installed) and funds transferred out within minutes of funding transaction. 
Personally I will not use mycelium again until this is fixed. Happy with it as a front end to my Trezor though. AirBitz looks to have a more sane key protection process and is what I use for a small portable wallet.

Mycelium shows transactions that it initiated. It does check the balance of the keys from the blockchain via the mycelium server, but once you have the keys you can make transactions using other methods. So it shows bit coin flow into address, address with 0 balance but no transaction out.

TBH I think I agree with you here. Almost bought one a few months ago and it would have saved me 5x the cost already.

No antivirus, no cloud save of backups. Pretty much certain no chance of theft by anyone close to me or with access to phone. If the seed was stolen from my encrypted password store *much* more would have disappeared. Pretty much gotta be something on the phone. 
BTW, my TI backups of Google Authenticator exposed my 2fa seed keys to the same vulnerability, so you might consider this as well.  All of mine were rotated last night.

Nope, no TOR used.

I have found the backup files made by Titanium. Could you tell me what the keyfile name might be? I see mds.db, and walletbacking.db as possible suspects. If this is the case, then I likely keyfile on SD card where other apps could have snagged it and as I have now learned it wasn't encrypted with the PIN. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 13:16:36
At this point I am 99% sure that the combination of Ti backup + app exposed the unencrypted wallet that was stolen by "something" as yet unknown. Would highly suggest you secure/delete the mycelium app data backup as that holds everything needed to sweep your wallet and almost every app can read the SD card without root permissions required.

Done as soon as I noticed issue

Only a few apps were specifically granted root permission: 
Titanium backup and SSHDroid and betterbattery stats 2.1.0.0_B5 downloaded from xda
No other apps have been granted permissions for root access. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:23:15
Unlikely. Was encrypted on a file only stored on a fairly secure linux box. Would likely have lost much more if this was compromised. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:25:46
Agree with warnings about root being a bit overblown as it just gives you control to grant permission if you decide, not everything gets root...

Unfortunately doesn't seem to be an option for Mycelium to have a password on the keys. A bit minus for the app in my opinion
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:59:23
My understanding is yes. That was my purpose in upgrading to the new ROM. Previous ROM was vulnerable. Transfer to this ROM occurred after upgrade.
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:40:20
As I have learned from this experience, Mycelium doesn't encrypt the keyfile with the PIN, so that doesn't really matter. Right now it looks like the Titanium backup stored a copy of this on my SD card where some malicious app picked it up.

Running version 2.4.4, but wallet was initially created around January on whatever version was current then.
Did check the CM hash on download
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:21:59
Thanks for doing a bit of tracking for me. Know the coins were gone and never coming back, but it is interesting to see where they went for the first hops. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:29:43
Will do some testing to see if Titanium backups up wallet or not. I wasn't able to get a restore of app + data to access my wallet, so I suspect not. That is why I went back to seed. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:14:44
Happy to share the info as I won't be using this wallet again obviously and the pocket change remaining has been swept out. Will send on later today. 
* Backup was before coins received
* First transaction after backup
* Only coins from before backup remained. Not all keys in wallet swept, only this one
* Will do via email
* No
* No other accounts with same seed

Unfortunately it won't sync "pretty quickly". Re-indexing the blockchain for electrum server takes well over 1 week of 100% CPU and very heavy I/O. You can download the 22Gb index from other users to speed things up. Details in post [here](

The actual setup wasn't that much work, but it was time consuming. 
I seemed to have success just putting onion address manually into server field, then sock5 proxy to 127.0.0.1:5090. This was remembered on restart of electrum and shouldn't leak your addresses when tor isn't running. The setup described on the link you gave with command line options won't save these options as you found. Note that even when you specifiy a  hidden service node, electrum will connect via TOR exit nodes to IRC channel to get server list and a few other electrum servers as a safety check that your chosen server is up to date and not running it's own fraudulent blockchain. I don't believe any addresses are sent to these servers. 
Agree it would be nice to have a low profile option that forces tor and limits other connections.

It isn't that [hard]( and it gives you both privacy and a good client. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 21:36:05
Sorry for late reply. 
Right now my 10000 transaction electrum db is 20GB and blockchain is 39GB, so you will likely need a bit more headroom than a 64gb card will provide. 
Also if you will need at least 40GB+ of extra space to store the bootstrapping files for both blockchain and electrum dbs temporarily.

You can even access it via Tor hidden service:
Details of the server [here](
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:41:29
To help you understand the trade-off, [here]( is a recent post that shows some of what is logged by a default Electrum setup. The code could be modified though to log more details about the addresses you query.
