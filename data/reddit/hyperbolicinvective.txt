Textbook irony.
Edit: textbook hypocrisy.

As a fairly early bitcoin adopter (2014/15), I just had to sell my bitcoin to make rent. feelsbadman

Just sold a little bit. Will buy again when it falls below 10k

No thanks

Something that a lot of these predictions have in common is that the people making the predictions could use them to justify doing things their way, reassuring others that things won't change. And the people making the predictions often knew that they couldn't switch to these new modes as well as others who understand how they work. In this subreddit specifically, Warren Buffet comes to mind. 
Bitcoin aside, I loved this.

I'm a complete novice, and didn't know Bitcoin supported changing cryptography. That's really cool.
Edit: all of that is awesome.

Ah I see. Thanks for the clarification. So Bitcoin's lifespan is limited to the adoption of quantum computing? Interesting

Okay, please explain. I'm fairly new, yes. I've been browsing it for about 3-4 months.

Not really a shortcut. Just shitting on someone for something they have no control over.

Not to defend his argument at all, but really? Why do you care how long he's been on Reddit? Maybe he has multiple accounts, maybe he's lurked, maybe he's new. You shouldn't give a damn.
