You agree to it implicitly by continuing to live in the US. Did you ever "agree" to abide by the law prohibiting murder?

Y'all are the best. I'm subscribing here just for the hilarious social/governmental commentary.

Because you choose live in a Democratic country, where your representatives have chosen to enact and abide by that contract. You're free to run for public office and make changes yourself.

You should familiarize yourself with emigration.

You don't pay sales tax either?

Then you aren't as strong of a believer of what you're preaching as you are leading others to believe.
Walk (can't use roads!) to Miami and take the cheapest (private sector) boat trip you can find to the Caribbean or South America. From there, wander until you come across an uninhabited land free of taxes and settle there for the rest of your days in the wilderness. 
That can't cost more than a few hundred bucks. You can earn that with a few days' manual labor.

Wait, are you under the impression you are not allowed to leave the US and move somewhere else? 
I'm going to blow your mind - it's possible, man. You can just move. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 02:32:04
I don't recognize your opinion on the subject because you choose to remain a US resident. That's your choice you consciously make. 
If you felt as strongly about this as you're acting, you'd move tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:05:33
Why do you still live in the US if you feel so strongly against taxes and government and our superior overlords? You're free to leave. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:06:42
Yes, you did.
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:53:55
Every day when I pay sales tax, and every year when I file a tax return. 
Plus, when I turned 16 and elected to remain a US citizen and resident.

That's a fantastic mental disconnect you have going. Have a good one. Go taxes!!! 
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:06:39
Yes, actually. Get emancipated and go. There is absolutely nothing stopping you if you feel that strongly. Other than excuses. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:35:47
Lol thanks for the laughs tonight. Have a good one. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:37:01
Oh that is just fantastic. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:26:06
Why do you still live in the United States (or other country with taxes) and not on some unincorporated island somewhere? With an uneducated population and no roads (just to stay on topic)? It must pain you every day to be here. Again, reality show. Please. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:15:47
Hahahaha move over other guy, you've just written my new favorite Reddit post of all time. You just called schools a prison. Have you considered a reality show following you around as you scavenge for your own food and trek through the wilderness eight miles to your job as a blacksmith? I would be your biggest fan. 
I should stop by here more often. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:24:49
Rofl. That's probably my favorite Reddit post ever.
 Once you graduate, go to college, and start to work you'll understand why you're wrong.  To be clear, you don't drive on public roads? Or attend public schools?
