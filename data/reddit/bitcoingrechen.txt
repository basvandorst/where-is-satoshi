I have done something similar. I recovered from it. I haven't gambled too much since..

(Slight spelling mistake there in the title, can't see an edit option.. )
Anyway, Jim Makos is a web veteran, he's done many interesting things online, like betfair horse trading, soccer betting, poker playing etc. He's intelligent, but claims he's not had time to look into Bitcoin. Let's change this. Greece does not have too many computer saavy persons that really have a voice and that will be listened to, he's one of them. Let's give him some love, go to his website and send him a message, let him know about why you think Bitcoin can help him and Greece. When he gets it, he will blog about it, and increase the adaptoin in Greece for sure. To make people understand Bitcoin in Greece, we must start with thos that has the intelligence to understand the technology. I think more voices will convince him.
Check out the wayback archive, he has a long time presence online and has a big audience. And I am not affiliated with him and will not benefit from this in any way but to see Bitcoin adaption increase in Greece.

First you should ask them if they would accept such an arrangement. Then you should negotiate how it would best be proved that you hold the balance in question.
For instance if they hold a bitcoin address and you send a token amount there from an address which holds a large holdning, they would understand that adress should belong to you. 
Perhaps signing would apply in this instance. Maybe this would help:

Why do we not start by engaging persons that does have the computer knowledge, but not yet has grasped the potential of bitcoin? Please upvote this post:

Why the negativity? Please elaborate.
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:10:36
Tell me more about that? Any links?
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:24:55
Yes, and I am trying to spread the word. But it seems like it's not catching on. :( 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:51:28
Keep on rocking, I hope you're dealing in cash. What about educational material, are you into that? And what about govt. stance. What's the legality of btc in greece?

If you look on the bitcointalk.org forum, there was a post back about someone running an altcoin conference in Georgia, they wanted to set up a traditional bank owned by bitcoiners, the idea is to then remove the 'hostile bank' problem. You might look into that. Otherwise I understand your position!

Not sure if getting in touch with the govt. right away is any good idea. If you have the balls, just install the machines, if you're bothered, deal with it at that point. INAL, so it's at your own risk. But invention wasn't normally done by asking for permission..
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:03:24
That risk gives itself, but in Greece many businesses operate without giving a damn. :p

Hi CleverEmu, no I'm not referring to myself in the 3rd person. I know this is an intelligent man, but for whatever reason, he's not realized the benefit of bitcoin yet. I think it's a matter of getting him to open his eyes. For it to happen, more bitcoiners should contact him through his blog and propose he looks more into bitcoin. If you look at his blog, he's written many good articles, and he's quite successful at what he does, but he has not yet realized the potential of bitcoin.
Since he lives in Greece, and fits the typical profile of a bitcoiner (young male with good technical abilities), I think if he gets more 'love' he realizes that he should perhaps actually look more into this 'bitcoin thing'. Many people still dismiss it as something not very serious, sadly. I want to change that, so I decided to start with him.
Just to be clear, this is not asking for donations, or asking for increased traffic to this particular blog, it's asking to help him understand Bitcoin, as he has not seriously looked into it yet, claiming he's too busy with his other taks. As he does all his business online, bitcoin can and will benefit him greatly. And it will also increase bitcoin adaption in Greece when he 'gets it'.
Thank you.

Well, this is a shocking thought: How about google check ads before they go live?
@_date: 2015-07-01 11:57:22
Did I get this right?
The admin at Bitstamp uses the same laptop for private stuff and work stuff, then his personal interests and lack of alertness causes the hotwallet to become emptied?
Perhaps using a separate machine, or at least some virtual machine/sandbox for punk rock and other 'interesting' private stuff would've worked out ok?
I see the report mention that this is a blow to the trust in the bitcoin ecosystem. I beg to differ, it only shows that Bitstamp had hired an incompetent sysadmin and had poor procedures.
2FA on all levels, no matter how inconvenient, and not mixing work and personal usage of such a computer is the way to go.
I wonder what's up next, honey traps with female spies installing malware while the sysadmin sleeps?

It moves slowly because the people of Germany allow it to move slowly. If the people organized, it could be changed. I assume most do nothing or move elsewhere, as most people do not want to waste their life on a campaign that might be futile.
@_date: 2015-07-01 11:59:08
Well said. A major problem is that no matter the good intentions, too many people end up corrupted once they get any power.

Good on you, there are some exceptions, but in general people above 40+ make me sick, because they've stiffned so hard in their ways.
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:30:32
I think cupcakes should be banned. After all, this might feed terrorists, also it is possible to hide hidden messages in there.
@_date: 2015-07-01 14:09:43
Interesting stats. Also to note, not sure if everybody agree: The older persons become, the more boring, uptight and serious they become. And along with that I would assume a lack of being able to think outside the box. Also a whole lot of people are more interested in preserving their own position than to bring the world forward.

I understand this sentence, however, what's the mechanisms behind it? How does the market 'know' if n amount of dollars is created? If we look at a car salesman, he's not paying attention to this, and most people are not paying attention to this, so what's the mechanisms for inflation happening (I assume that's what's meant by dilution).
I read a story once about apples becoming more expensive at the supermarket. Someone wanted to find out why it was like this, but the basic explanation every part of the supply-chain was that they raised their prices because others raised their prices.
If anyone could explain the mechanisms behind inflation/dillution and how it happens in practise, I would appreciate it. On a basic level, if 1000 million dollars are 'printed' and nobody knows about that fact, except a few people, would inflation still take place? How and why?

It's about time people realize that the elite only want to exploit them. When the govt. takes your money it's a 'haircut', when you take anybody's money it's theft. The most cynical powers in a society grabs the power, then exploits the rest. I would think very few in the elite is affected much by what's happening in Greece right now. And we can only imagine what it's going to be like when cash is banned outright, then we'd see negative interest rates, and haircuts whenever your govt. deem it necessary. No wonder people are looking into bitcoin. Interesting times ahead.

Browsed through the article and got the gist of it. In short: BaFin is a bunch of assholes that licks the back of the established system and makes it very difficult if not impossible for any enthusiastic entrepeneur to get started with his bitcoin business. As it's said, what you need is capital and lawyers. My impression of Germany has greatly decayed after I tried to do a startup a couple years back. Dealing with any financial german company was an outright nightmare, tens of thousands of euros was lost in the process.
At no point was I met with a "yes, can do" attitude. BaFin is another joke. They never reply to any communication over e-mail, and I assume you must have lawyers that can grease the right cogwheels to get anything moving.
It's as far from a free society that embrace entrepeneurship as you can come.
I guess the people deserve this as this is what has come out from the elected leadership. Most people do however not care about entrepeneur ship, and is unable to think outside the box. I salute those who do not give up, but move elsewhere and continue to follow their dreams.
Some unfortunately gives up their dream, and rather get an ordinary job.
