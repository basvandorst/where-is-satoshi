Show me? I've been in BTC a lot longer then you and have had zero issues same with 99% of coinbase user. Too bad your having an isolated problem. I'll wait for proof of this "coinbase scam" otherwise quit bitching

bitcoin has done this many times before. $200 no. its stabilized at about 800-900 and will not dip below the 750 mark.

It's a capital gains tax like any investment. Yes you pay taxes once you realize your gains 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:45:32
According to your post history you also live in EU... This is an article about America and the IRS. Here you absolutely pay capital gains taxes on any investment soon as your realize profit. Did you even bother to read the article or  just read the headline and decided "derp no taxes on bitcoin nope not ever derp"
