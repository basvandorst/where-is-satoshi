What a strange read. Paul is clearly very intelligent and knowledgable, and I wish his project the best of luck. However, the article (and others I followed up on) show an overpowering belief in his way or the highway. That's very inflexible and doesn't allow for planned or unplanned innovation. You can't logically see the future in the way Paul believes, or perhaps you can to a point but you can't predict the knock-on or side effects. Smart contract platforms are a case in point. Maybe Eth/Root are not the final answer (almost certainly not) but they are allowing some wonderful experimentation.

No I can't see the future, that was precisely my point. There is plenty of grey and I thought your post came out black and white. At one point you say you demanded bitcoin core be used and your justifications implied risk of new tech. There is some truth to that, but the entire sector is risky and unknown and there are advantages to using other tech.
Using Ethereum (or Rootstock in future) allows decentralised app experiments extremely quickly. I and many others have built experiments in Ethereum in a matter or hours or days which just aren't feasible elsewhere, and those experiments then inform what we do next, including funding rounds (not just crowdfunded!). The technology isn't a fixed target, rather we have the tools we have now to prototype.
I'm intrigued as to what you feel they are both harmful and cannot work. I disagree with your condition 2 because it's too simplistic a view to use in general terms, although it does impact some specific projects to a greater or lesser degree. That said, I'm prepared to change my mind because I have no particular buy in to any tech, it's just a means to an end.
I agree with you to some extent about the 'investment thing' but then anyone in this space surely knows by now what they're dealing with. It's like penny stocks. Ethereum is way, way past being marketed as a investment option and even at the time it barely was by -most- involved (Vitalik's vision was somewhat hijacked by certain individuals to make money). Some involved do think it will replace Bitcoin (not me), but so what if they do? There are Bitcoin idealists, Ethereum idealists, NXT idealists, etc. Augur is little different. People buy in to the idea as much as anything and this is still the wild west when it comes to such things - everyone knows that surely by now.
Edit: Read the link you provided earlier with your explanation on why ethereum can't work. With regard to oracles I agree in general as I've always had the same issue. My expectation was that they needed to provide value add in some way, where the oracle element is a side part and essentially free. Value add can be through an alarm call, off chain processing, etc. It'd perhaps be commoditised but probably workable.
However, you're making an assumption that there is no value in a particular contract running and this isn't true because you've not considered the notion of 'value'. Let's say an identity was on the blockchain somehow. The identity contract which supports the identity has to be supported by a) other contracts and/or b) client software. Choices have to be made which identity contracts to support. Cloned contracts may be technically identical and have no fees but they won't be used because the other software (on chain or off chain) has already decided what it will support.
"The contract at address abcd1234 we know is run that software co X and we trust any changes they make will be valid (because we're probably talking contract frameworks here, not a single write once contract in many cases), therefore we directly support it's API in identity checks."
Cloned (parasitic) contracts have no value here, or at least they need to work their way up the chain to be trusted. Absolutely it'll happen but it's not mutually assured destruction at all, just like open source software isn't always free. There is value to brand and value to trust. Smart contracts are not as trust-less or brand-less and people believe.

The blockchain is a public good, not yours or mine or bobsburgers' or satoshi's. It is everyone's. Your spam is someone else's critical data. As long as fees are paid it's legit. 
If you want to control how the chain is used, it can only be through fees and engineering and core dev consensus.


That's logically untrue and is very much your personal view.
At least until core dev come out and specifically say that the Bitcoin blockchain must only be used for direct monetary (i.e. bitcoin itself) applications and all engineering going forwards will be done accordingly. Therefore no one should build anything else on the bitcoin network ever because it categorically will break. If core dev say this, we should have no problem with it because at least it defines the direction.
As for OP_RETURN, I didn't read all the conversations but if anyone thought it would only be used for monetary transactions they must have had their head deep, deep in the sand. And there is certainly no way to enforce as much. From memory, there were many conversations about other uses people would do with it and it was implemented as the best of a bad bunch of solutions.

It wasn't regulation that did anything at all. Napster failed because it was centralised. It (possibly directly) lead to bittorrent and decentralisation - and hence bitcoin. 
Music streaming and digital music purchase happened because users wanted it, the technology allowed for it (including through p2p tech), and piracy pushed the music industry into it very grudgingly.
The true napster effect would be for bitcoin to push encumbents and startups to do new things, not to use bitcoin funnily enough. Bitcoin is decentralised and has first mover advantage so it'll probably be around a while :)

@_date: 2015-12-17 08:48:16
Well there are cryptographic time stamp services far cheaper than bitcoin but bitcoin is nicely persistent. As was point out though, you always require the remaining data. Often that's actually ok, what you're after is tamper proof time stamping - they don't need a blockchain for that but I've suspected for a while this may become a de facto standard as they're well placed to do so. 
Also, consider that it's very likely a first step only. This area is the easiest by far to get accepted by any regulators. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 09:22:39
Bitcoin is open source and requires a token to operate. It's also been cloned 1000s of times now.
So the answer is brand, trust, first mover advantage, user buy-in, off-chain software reliance.
@_date: 2015-12-16 09:32:07
You're over simplifying parasitic contracts. They will affect some use cases in terms of profitability but you're missing the wider picture.
I do feel that some in the community don't understand how parasitic contracts may or will destroy their business model but you're view is similarly extreme. I struggle with seeing how a pure oracle business can work but I wouldn't like to say it can't work. 
For a DAO which takes a transaction cut, I think it's much more complicated however. And for anything which mixes centralised and decentralised, for which there are many applications, parasitic contracts are even less likely to be an issue. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 20:02:11
Bitcoin is (currently) quite inflexible and you have to perform all kinds of tricks, including client side. 
I don't dispute that it has the buy in but it does also have a trail of trash behind it which holds it back in some areas. I'm dealing with the people who will handle regulation or otherwise and I assure you that bitcoin has a serious image problem that we're not going to solve quickly; other tokens don't have this. It's not a technical argument nor a long term one necessarily, but it does exist. 
Where I'm sure we agree is that tokens for the sake of raising funds don't make sense unless you go in knowing it is a pure penny stock gamble, but many investors are still not wise to this. 
As for enforcing token use, well I'd refer back to my arguments about dapps generally. For a full DAO I'm not convinced as the contracts can simply be copied without the complication; so what is the value add unless client apps, possibly regulators and users (public, private; enterprise) believe the DAO one to be of more value perhaps because of network effect and/or pr. For example, public licensing and ownership. I'm not saying bitcoin can't do this (ascribe use btc) but it doesn't do rule based enforcement or small but meaningful data at all well. I see other chains and tech as a way to find out what dapps are useful (if any of course) and perhaps bitcoin's evolution will be guided by such. 
(Written on a train; hopefully isn't nonsense)

In fact what you want is for the security side to be heavily customisable. I've spent a lot of time designing around this. Think of it as like a bank where you get to decide all your security restrictions, from amounts withdrawn per day/week, time delay for access, to IP restrictions, and so on.
This is still reliant on a centralised server when it ought to be decentralised (voting pools?), but one thing at a time eh!
It's also reliant on you not losing all your keys. Still, other options can mitigate even that, and the company going pop.

IIRC BitGo have one key only they can use, they hold one key of yours but encrypted and generated on your system, which is a shared secret only with other users of that account, and you provide them with the public part of a 3rd key which you can generate and store offline.
They have configurable security policies so you can set it up to prevent hackers running away with your funds even if they have your log in or manage to snafu your key in the rare times it's provided to you (decrypted in memory).
The security policy needs many more features (planned) and the recovery system needs to be easier for if they go pop, but both do work.
They can't access funds without you signing in, but you can if you use your 3rd key.  The trust is in the transaction generated in your browser, however - which may still be considered an issue - and any flaws in their security policy implementation.
Early days but such systems are what we'll all be using in future. We're still at the mvp stage with all the providers.
@_date: 2014-02-22 12:12:32
I agree with you except for one bit. Bitcoin is like the gold standard to me. I don't see ethereum or anything else replacing it any time soon. However, I also don't want to see features like this going into bitcoin without major testing as it is far too risky. The best alt coins are the ones that research new ground. They can work alongside bitcoin for sure and in some cases bitcoin can pull in tested tech. Ethereum would in no way replace or hurt bitcoin. I have yet to see any alt that will. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:37:05
Additionally, I would definitely like to be able to sign the transaction offline thus never exposing either key to the network (as Armoury can).

I'm sorry but you're talking nonsense. I've been a professional developer and CEO for nearly 20 years so I'd like to think I know my shit. I have no idea if ethereum will work and they certainly got their investment model utterly wrong, which I do have issues with. Not enough for miners, too much risk for investors (they themselves didn't get that much; people misunderstood). However, take the time to actually understand what is going on in the tech and why. Neither of the above are going to happen with good software, proper testing, and a viable economic model. It's the latter that is going to be very tricky. Critique it properly rather than just say it's too complex or throwing around attacks on their use of technobabble. The software is already there for you, this is not vapourware. It saddens me that people are agreeing with you.

Yes but in this case they did not empty the account. They completed the theft only after they saw money leaving it and a new log in. That probably tipped them off that the account was about to be closed. 
If the owner had been notified immediately about the initial amount / key account settings changed, then they could have saved 150 BTC. These settings can have cool down periods etc, giving the original owner time to handle problems. It can't stop accounts being emptied in one go but it would have helped in this case.

Can we keep the myriad of get rich quick scheme alts separate from fund raising to create new protocols/systems/DAOs such as Mastercoin and Ethereum, whatever one's concerns with them (and I have a fair few).
The notion of a DAO raising initial funds is an interesting one and there are multiple ways of doing it. Ruling one out simply because some people do get rich schemes is just silly. 
It's about community funding whereby the community has a stake as opposed to simply made a contribution. Doing that under existing securities law is painful, barely doable if at all, and extremely expensive.
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:38:37
The customer and the merchant both already pay. It forms a major component of the card interest on credit cards or bank fees. The merchant has zero fault yet chargebacks cost merchants a fortune. 
I understand what you're saying and have pointed that out for a long while. However, it only affects people in countries where credit cards are popular - they are nowhere near as popular as people think. 
Paying by bitcoin does not take away your customer rights. It's just like paying in cash is all.

More importance should be placed upon the individual accounts in Coinbase. If an app wants access to my primary account, I honestly think that app should be vetted by Coinbase.
Almost all apps would be perfectly well served by being associated with their own account, or - if the user wanted - a non-main account the users were prepared to allow 3rd party access to.
This would limit phishing and theft potential due to issues with 3rd parties as well.

You clearly have no foresight, that's all I'm going to say. Bitcoin is awesome tech but is just the start.

I discussed this concept with and one of the Ethereum guys. Their issue was you could sell your vote and then prove that you voted in a particular way, which can't be done with current voting systems. Their suggested fix was attaching something to that 'key' that would make it too risky for you to let others have it, such as something to do with personal identity.
I felt it important for a voter to verify their vote was what they wanted, they felt the risk of corruption too high. So I guess it's a case of pick your corruption?

I find it frustrating and ironic that peter talks of the dangers of centralisation of development when his own antagonistic actions actually causes a form of centralisation itself, because of his vocality and approach to discussion. 
Yes he means well and he's very intelligent, but I find his approach can be disruptive. I'd like to continue to see his valuable comments but without the vocality and antagonism which are damaging at a human level, thus potentially at a development level. 
Perhaps a slight tangent, but lobbying for bitcoin is absolutely critical and anyone who thinks otherwise is just wrong, and dangerously so. Lack of lobbying would allow lobbyists for technologies not as free to get pushed in front of bitcoin legally, and it would also affect the education process. 
I'm not a fan of the US lobbying system in particular, but it is what it is. Pretending it doesn't exist is folly, although maybe in the future some decentralised tech enabled by bitcoin tech could contribute to changing such a (imho) corrupt system.

There are a couple of other currencies worth considering for their use cases, such as darkcoin.

True - I did say account hack and made clear at the very start where the failures were. 
That said, blockchain.info could implement further things on their system to warn of large amounts bring moved/low security with large amounts, etc. I've spoken to other forthcoming providers and these options will be offered by them.
@_date: 2014-11-22 09:46:21
The blockchain cost you just have is OT and also incorrect. Additionally, the way these things can be implemented can be really cheap. 
The requirement for a card of some kind is only one way of doing it as well. 
I'm not saying blockchain based solutions are definitely the answer, but that they are worth exploring. 
Your comment about home voting being bad is besides the point. It is happening as is e voting whether you like it or not. The political decisions by politicians are completely irrelevant to this discussion and have nothing whatsoever to do with voting mechanics.

It's all about the regulatory environment. The Neo team appear well aware of the possibilities. They could likely provide volume, however, which is critical.

Agreed. The wallet backup system could be clearer. It's also why I suggested additional encryption (on top) for the backup wallet as a default option. People's emails etc get hacked all the time and too many people use the same password everywhere. 
I'm not saying this is a perfect solution crypto wise, just that it may be enough to prevent another % of thefts, especially from the less tech savvy. It's about increasing difficulty, not making it impossible.
@_date: 2014-11-21 09:30:20
But people do vote at home and increasingly so, and electronic voting is also increasingly used. Whether you're right or wrong, that already happens.
Blockchain voting is not expensive at all - in fact it ought to be obscenely cheap and easily handled with open source software.
You could also retain in situ voting if you wanted, and you could even do a form of 2 factoring each vote. There is still an issue of you being able to sell your vote if you can verify your own vote was recorded correctly, so then perhaps it has to be become 'expensive' or risky for you to do so.
The vote itself needs to be secret and with no results available until after voting has been completed. That's essential, but that can be done too.
Edit to add - the US seems quite happy making it difficult for people to vote in all kinds of ways, and have had problems with e-voting machines. Elsewhere, the situation is much worse for all types of voting leading to issues for UN observers. Blockchain voting should be easy, cheap, and trivial to monitor beyond the vote buying issue I mentioned.

A new address is created when a new payment is requested - the merchant set up created a new address per customer payment. The wallet needs to have the new keys added, which means you need a new wallet backup.

It's implementing coinjoin properly and experimentally. The dev is currently successfully beta testing it in public. It's not a complete and fully anonymous coin but it is much, much harder for individuals to see your financial movements. From a privacy rather than criminal point of view, it's good enough. Whether it will have long term use I'm unsure, but it's the best of the bunch coming through at the moment. This is how alt coins should be used, to experiment with new features. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 01:58:17
You misunderstand me. I haven't said it will work, I have said it's a worthy experiment. The instruction set is still being developed and I agree it needs to be super simple, as an assembly developer myself originally.
Bitcoin isn't going to implement this and nor should it, but bitcoin itself should benefit from experiments and developments in the cryptocoin space.
Also, explain why it will never work? Why is it not worth attempting it? What is your precise issue?
There is  a lot of misinformation and criticism without justification. If you consider the current instruction set to be over complicated then explain why and how it would be better. Personally, I am intrigued and somewhat dubious as to if he economics can work. I also see plenty of problems occurring simply because it's new. This has not been done before and it may die horribly. I accept that as part of the risk and I am certainly not saying invest in it. As a technology and as a research experiment, it's worthwhile. On that we obviously differ.

You should be able to instantly block the address and all withdrawals, but changing it should take time and evidence.

Actually no. If you can't answer many of these questions then you haven't researched properly and also have little imagination. You do not appear qualified to be posting scam attacks under the guise of being a software engineer when you haven't even done the simplest research. There is plenty to critique, which can be done positively, but you are not doing that. I guess your issue is altcoins and fund raising in general. Colored coins, btw, will hopefully be useful too but both they and Mastercoin has many iissues. They are all valid research projects, none are scams of any kind. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:35:20
Keep the coins - this is a long haul game. Walk away from BTC for a couple of months.
@_date: 2014-04-09 22:18:46
I'm not against those options but traditional VC is slow, painful and frequently not appropriate. Kickstarter is more popularity contest and doesn't allow backers to invest. I'm doubtful how successful a crypto project would be on KS and it's tricky in different territories as well. 
Neither option is great for DAO purposes.
Token based profit-shares are legally dubious AFAIK (I am very dubious about anyone doing this and it's not just the SEC who would see them as tradable securities) but selling coins used on the system is a different proposition, if legally a little grey. It does add a gambling type element but I think that's for people to decide to do or not - whatever they wish.
@_date: 2014-11-21 11:59:39
That's a step beyond the scheme I came up with and I need to reread it again to ensure it all works, but in principle it's very clever. Making it easy to understand isn't actually important - it's about making it easy to use - by voters and organisations, and then easy to verify, e.g. by a UN team. The software needs to be open source. Have you done anything about this?
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:43:03
Server side. An inside job in this case would have been trivial to pull off. However, I'm trying to make sense of the actual transactions. Theft 1 was made outside of blockchain.info, for a precise amount, and based on the default address created with the account only. Theft 2, 5 days later, was done from blockchain.info or the API, was done as the merchant was trying to log in, was after the merchant had moved 10 BTC earlier in the day, and was done in 3 human entered amounts as fast as they could type. It did not look automated.
@_date: 2014-10-30 09:27:27
I've been thinking about this. I think what's needed is a non profit and open source multi-sig system for multiple blockchains with highly configurable security policies. If oracles can be factored in yet an email/mobile notification system could still work (primary oracle?) then even better.

It's not just about scams/profit, it's also about funding development. Linux style development is not the only way and has its own issues.

It's a good idea as long as it's optional. However, I would make it the default setting on account creation and only to be disabled with suitable warning. I have a major problem with all wallets and exchanges (that I've used) in that they default to rubbish security. I know someone who lost a great deal of $$$ when a few simple default settings on blockchain.info would have avoided the problem. 
Perhaps a simple question should be on sign-up - "Do you want very low security or to go through the high security set up process?". There are uses for both, but let's treat people as vulnerable rather than experts (because endless thefts prove that not to be the case).

Theft 1 was done with the private key. Theft 2 was done while logged in or using the API. You can't keylog the private key. It could have been scraped from a compromised machine when the wallet was decrypted, but then so could the rest of the data. 
The machine most likely to be compromised was used for the 10 BTC transfer but not for the later log in, at the same time as which the account was emptied - seemingly by hand. This was a fresh network and machine on which BTC hadn't been used, with a fresh blockchain.info plug-in installed and some identifier info pasted rather than typed. In no way perfect of course.
Could have been two different thefts, multiple machines could be compromised, or the thief could have been notified of the 10 BTC transfer and log in a few hours later then got scared he would lose out (but why wait for a new log in? That risked a wallet back up being used instead). 
The first one could have been anything - perhaps the original wallet backup was poorly protected or the address was flawed (there were a few I seem to remember), the second one doesn't feel the same. It emptied the account rather than the default address, did it in human terms, and while logged in.
Basically I want to work out if this is an inside job or if this is a standard way thieves have operated. Note that the stolen funds have not yet moved.

I did this at the weekend. I downloaded Linux Mint and Googled instructions for putting the installer onto a USB key. It needs to be 4 gigs or greater to install properly (at least my 2 gig install failed part way).
Boot from the USB, and it'll take you to a desktop from where you can click the install icon and install on your HD.
In my case, once I booted into the new OS, I copied over BitAddress (you can use the pure HTML file) and Truecrypt.
Other than updating the OS as normal, I did not go online. I then also removed the Wifi and Bluetooth drivers (you can literally move/delete the wifi and bluetooth driver folders).
I disabled the LAN in the BIOS and password protected + encrypted the BIOS, HD, and user.
Even if someone got on there, all my data is in encrypted truecrypt volumes (triple encryption) with random passwords not kept anywhere easy to get hold of.
I used BIP38 encrypted paper wallets.
I also worked out a system to allow family to recover the data should that be needed, but no one person can do it. I'lll additionally make use of PassGuardian in future - that allows you to split a pass phrase (any text) into multiple parts, with a rule that states m of n need to be put together to recreate the phrase. That means e.g. 5 people can have different parts and any 3 of them can put it together. Make sure they all have the hash of the correct phrase though.
Took a bit of time but worth it!
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:57:40

What you want is a presentation from key members of the community to the board so they understand that this is more than just accepting another payment system. That's entirely fine of course, but becoming aware of what's going to happen is critical. Think back to when wikipedia happened and what many people will have said. The vision is important, being open minded is important, and being fully aware of the facts and ecosystem is critical.
Bitcoin, and by Bitcoin I mean any decentralised token holding and transfer system, could turn out to be more than just another way to fund wikipedia. It could open up avenues you simply wouldn't think of without understanding what youre actually dealing with.

I can't take credit. I took advice from a client who knows more about these matters than I do. They were very firm that this is likely a money grab by lawyers wanting to profit from the situation unless they provide significant evidence to the contrary. 
To be more precise, they said you'll be paying to send someone over to japan, sit in a hotel, and send messages to and forth but achieving nothing that wasn't going to happen anyway.
The company website and history is an additional red flag. If anyone wants a good lawyer, try Marco Santori in New York or Eitan at Sheridans in London. Not cheap but they know their stuff.

It's a company, altho obviously it's a person and people's jobs in the end. Ignoring what the failures were, it does show that you can't just hire any old outsource firms/individuals to implement your Bitcoin merchant facilities. They need to know what they are doing and give the right advice.

There are a number of these projects on the go and they are hugely important to Bitcoin. Most people simply don't realise how critical they are to security.

It has been raised but maybe not in a form you recognise. The issue is one of economics. It has to pay to be a miner so it's all about balancing the cost of processing with the reward. Personally, I think they got the mining reward wrong for year 1 and I think the economics are going to be hard to get right, eg cost of processing. They really didn't have an answer in the white paper beyond educated guesswork. It may take quite some experimentation. I don't mean to be negative about it, this is a new area and no one knows the answers. The devs have to start somewhere.

Well I suggest you look again. Whether it is right or wrong to file defensive patents is a matter of debate. For a small company to do it looks very risky because what starts as a defensive patent can quickly end up otherwise unless its immensely well protected from buy outs, VCs, and so on. If that's even possible. However, I understand the position and the author has pointed out his historic record and viewpoint. 
It's much more positive to engage in situations like this, not act aggressive based on some headline.

I don't belief this is a blockchain issue because we'd be seeing a lot more of it. This dates back 5 days to the original theft. There was another theft too but I don't have the details so I can't collate the data. It seems the thief cleaned the wallet addresses and the backup situation is...
@_date: 2017-02-20 12:37:54
Will take a look. When I used the app last week it treated it as a contract (understandably) which meant it wasn't possible to verify the true recipient of tokens, allowing an attacker to fake a transaction on a compromised machine.

Segwit does not do equiv to 2 meg blocks and you're confused over the tech. Segwit does allow some increase and is good technology, but is non-trivial and requires all software changes including wallets and it takes time. It should be done but let's not conflate different things. 2 meg blocks are for miners. A hard fork is quite doable. It's been done before. But now we're on to the same tech arguments which is missing the point. Again.

It's a better solution only if you fundamentally do not want block size changes and want the blockchain as a settlement layer, the current choice of core dev. That's fine but let's at least stop saying that SegWit safer and faster.

Not mixing any metaphors. It is you who are taking a purist view and it's entirely the problem I'm referring to. Bitcoin is not about to die but it is taking risks when many claim it is not. 
Claiming bitcoin is healthy as technology may be true (depending what you think bitcoin is), but the bitcoin ecosystem, that is the people, is not. This is undeniable, but clearly we disagree over if that matters and if there is a right and wrong side. Respectfully of course, which is my other point. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 23:37:06
Personally I want to see greater emphasis on a cohesive community but I think so many mistakes have been made (inc here) that it would need some major backtracking. That's less for dev and more for community and biz however, for the reasons you provided. 
As for the block debate, I'm in favour of 2 megs in the interim and done as part of an overall roadmap. I think this would smooth a lot of things without risking bitcoin security. There'll still be dissenters but they will move much more to the fringe. Contrary to what some say, it is possible to compromise. The answer is not clearcut technology wise partly because it depends what vision of bitcoin you buy into. 
From a purely technical pov, if you're prepared to stop considering bitcoin as a p2p digital cash system then blockstream's approach is best. If not, time to come up with better alternatives. If bitcoin is to be a settlement layer, I don't believe that to be the original vision or what many people bought into. Doesn't make it wrong though. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:54:32
If people would be sensible then it isn't contentious. A 2 meg can kick really shouldn't be. The alternative is a major upgrade of all software, is unproven, and brings engineering risk - little of wrhich can be avoided. At the very least one must accept risks on both sides but if this has been handled better by all the devs we wouldn't be in this stupid x is better than y situation. The truth is it's complicated and shouldn't be about sides. That's what's really annoying. Leadership issues and I include theymos in that. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 00:34:02
The observable universe is bigger than where you're looking. Engineering can be about more than the cogs, it has to understand what the purpose is, what the machine does, who will use it, costs and benefits of materials and requirements, the social arena, the business arena. It's not a narrow view that's needed all the time. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 18:02:50
Sigh. You haven't pointed out any error. You are disagreeing about the dangers of problems in the community but I did not say bitcoin is imploding, I said it's in danger of imploding. 
Let me be more specific. The bitcoin community is in danger of imploding and this may have repercussions for bitcoin. You say it will not, I disagree and think it might (not that it will) therefore it should be a considering factor if dealing with marginal engineering choices such as if/when to do a one off block size increase.
What you cannot say is that there aren't problems when there manifestly are. Whether those problems will be detrimental in the long run - it's a non zero probability.
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:34:23
That's not true. Satoshi created what he could at the time but things move on. Scaling was always an issue but Bitcoin had to start somewhere. Multiple layers were probably always a necessity for true scale. Even so, nothing about anyone's proposals stop bitcoin working as a p2p e-cash network should users wish to use it, the debate is really about fees. I certainly haven't seen anything that would cripple Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:15:25
That isn't fud. It's doing perfectly fine as a form of digital gold but it can't do anything significant technology wise whilst significant development is paralysed. That's what needs to change if we want Bitcoin to be more than this. And if we don't want more then it's just fine. However, it's crap as a currency.
I disagree about Eth and Etc. I follow both with interest and am part of the Eth community. Saying Etc is 'ready to pounce' is misunderstanding things. They both may work, one may do, they both may fail, and there are several other EVM based projects. Ethereum is far, far bigger than Etc (development wise as well as market cap, and only the former I really care about) and has virtually all the developer/commercial support, with the exception of Charles H's (well funded) team. 
Projects like Dfinity are worth a look btw.

I don't disagree with you in principle but I do when you talk about bitcoin. It's an unfinished technology and where most of the business is from speculators. Ossifying it now is too early, as is very obvious from such community splits (including technical, users, businesses, holders, traders, miners).

@_date: 2016-03-14 13:49:21
Bitcoin is in danger of imploding. It isn't imploding. It is in danger of it because the bitcoin community is being split into two camps and I don't see that as healthy for bitcoin in general. You're welcome to disagree on that point as it is purely a matter of opinion.
However, if you genuinely cannot see this then there really is not more to say. I'd have thought the very existence of classic, the problems in the community discussion forums, the constant to'ing and fro'ing at events and roundtables, the fall outs between developers, and so on and so on would have made that blindingly obvious. Classic, XT et al are, in one sense, completely fine as the 'popular' view will win, but let's not ignore why they exist in the first place and all the associated mess.
I also find it disappointing that you're taking the disrespectful route which is part of the very problem I've been talking about.
@_date: 2016-01-13 12:42:15


You said it, right there. As far as YOU are concerned. It it way, way past obvious that there is huge disagreement on this. There is no right answer and this is why you are being accused of censorship. You are imposing your contentious view on everyone else, whether they agree or not. This is an abuse of power and highly damaging.
At this point it's real head in the sand behaviour and you would do a great deal of good by letting this go.
Moderation to prevent too many threads on the same topic is fine, imposing views on what is an altcoin and what is not where there is such disagreement is censorship, not moderation. If there is a fork, and such a fork doesn't take over Bitcoin but does gain sufficient strength to survive, it becomes an alt and can move elsewhere. Until then, it's close enough to bitcoin to be valid.

I can't vouch for the chances of success although obviously those I spoke to were positive it would be within 12 months. I've heard this all before.
The idea is you could buy 'bitcoin' through your bank but transfers would only be allowed to other KYCed users, e.g. same bank or other banks on a trusted network. It's no use for those wanting to spend it or fully be in control but it is a way for any old Joe to invest in it when they see good news about Bitcoin.
I was explaining how to do it to a friend yesterday - it's still far too tough. My dad proper stressed out when trying to sell some of his and take profit the other week. Happily it got sorted and it's paid for a lovely trip to the other side of the world :)
People like my dad should be able to get it and convert it at their bank just like any other bank account. When that happens, Bitcoin goes big but just not in the way many here would perhaps prefer.

That logic isn't right because you jumped to an assumption ignoring other possibilities. 
1) it wasn't a de facto ddos. The truth here depends upon your definition of when a ddos occurs or not. You use it to describe a use of the bitcoin network at scale which you dislike because the network couldn't operate like that at a much larger scale. 
2) you jump to calling it an intentional attack completely missing the perfectly obvious conclusion that it was a for profit and interesting project (for ev, for players) that had the side effect of common satoshi payments which the bitcoin network isn't best at handling (but was quite capable of doing).
3) an intentional ddos looks very different, as we've all seen. 
Bitcoin is not yours luke and it's tiring, frustrating and damaging seeing how you try and bend it to your will constantly, refusing to compromise or accept that you're wrong.

Whilst the mechanics and engineers are sitting arguing about building a bigger bus, smaller seats, charging more, or changing the layout, the people are starting to catch other buses. 
The current crop of dominant engineers are against a can kick and are giving, frankly, highly academic and theoretical reasons against it. We even know that some of these people didn't believe bitcoin could work for the theoretical reasons. And that's my problem with all this - the search for an amazing perfect solution when, for an interim period at least, there is an utterly simple one that is not perfect and may have fringe effects but would have been an acceptable compromise for everyone. Bitcoin itself is a compromise. It's good enough. It is not perfect.

@_date: 2017-03-14 10:20:28
Same here but it all depends what you want Bitcoin to be. I honestly think it's decentralised gold and other things should be left to newer technology at this point. 
I have never agreed with bitcoin maximalism - it makes no sense plus it also has many of the same risks as centralisation. Centralising in a single decentralised currency makes it easy to attack (e.g unlimited) and also means one technical failure blows up everything. 
Diversity wins out in nature for a very good reason. Having a diverse ecosystem is important. This is why I disagree wholeheartedly with Vinny's other recent tweets. It feels like he's living in 2013 when everyone was busy cloning bitcoin, doing rapid pump/dumps on coins that barely lasted weeks. Whilst many alts won't survive (as most startups don't), most of the top 40 are actually interesting and have been around a while.

Good article which put across a point I hadn't considered - Roger Ver's financial muscle and control of the bitcoin.com domain. However, as with other articles, I don't see how it changes anything. The only real change is getting various people in a room together and not letting them out until they come to agreement. A very small number of people have sufficient economic/mining power to massively disrupt bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:49:16
This is just wrong and hysterical. A fork would mean bitcoin (core) is a united community again, something we really need. BTU would also be united and would go their own way. Other than traders enjoying the ebb and flow of fear and monetising two forks, after a few weeks they will be their own thing. In all likelihood bitcoin (core) would settle down very happily and BTU would by the alt. A valid alt like ETC. 
It really is time to learn the lessons from ETH/ETC rather than constantly denigrate either of them. A united community is really important. That hurts bitcoin more than blocksize. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:01:28
Then you misunderstand decentralisation. Bitcoin is paralyzed and some argue it's being attacked. Unity isn't everyone agreeing on everything but what we have now is pretty much a disaster. I know plenty about Eth and honestly it's really long past being any kind of problem. Ethereum got over it, it's certain bitcoin people who aren't aware of this. I'm suggesting you take a look. (I hold both as i believe they do different things and ETH is far more risky)
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:43:51
It doesn't have to fracture the community. Key difference is bitcoin has no mutually agreed direction and scaling plans. Ethereum does. Its community fractured over another stance but they don't have the fear of a hard fork meaning that both sides could move forwards. 
We've been playing this argument out for years and got nowhere yet :(
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:07:02
I think you'd be cutting off your nose to spite your face. ETH looks silly still to some here but frankly the rest of the world and people developing in that community are getting on just fine. This whole conversation has become so dogmatic and damaging. 
I would prefer a compromise but without it, or some credible new solution, bitcoin is stuck. That's fine if we're happy with digital gold but not much else. It sucks as a currency these days. I only use it through centralised companies and if I'm moving money around now i don't use btc. Too slow, unpredictable and expensive.

It's the continual 'altcoin' reference and disagreeable moderation/censorship that's the problem. This isn't Bitcoin core but it does have an awful lot of power because of its reach, and it is now effectively saying it inherently allows discussion of  bitcoin core's current position. 
Moreover, it reflects the Bitcoin community. Major splits and arguments here spill over elsewhere, that's the problem with the moderation/censorship going on. It's much more damaging then allowing the discussions to happen openly.
Sure, people will bicker but that's far better than the accusations, paranoia, community splits and hugely bad PR we're seeing now. People have used this Reddit as an open place to discuss Bitcoin and now feel that they cannot do that. It's wrong.

It's posts like this that are painting it into sides, attacks, black and white. None of this is true. Stand back and accept that this is complicated. It's not an attack on bitcoin. It's not about corporations. It's actually a really, really complicated engineering and economic problem. 
Picking sides is wrong. Listen to the evidence and be prepared to change your mind. I have no side and I have no favoured solution but the damage being caused by makin this into a fight is far worse then either 2 meg blocks or segwit or ln or anything else.

@_date: 2016-06-22 12:47:24
Spent much of the last 48 hours discussing this with people on both sides. It's really complicated and nuanced. We could say the same about Satoshi back in the day. Vitalik is not pushing hard for a hard fork (it was his view that it may be appropriate) and he's openly allowing all members of the foundation to take their own view.
However, note that ethereum is still essentially reasonably centrally controlled. It's one of its better points at this stage of development as it allows a strong direction of development and bigger changes. It's very immature. 
It won't be a better point if we're still in that situ in 10 years though.
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:06:57
UTXO does a great bookkeeping job whereas regular 'programs' (which are what smart contracts really are) need to encode their own double entry. A failure to do so or a flaw can lead to the same kind of problems bitcoin has seen from many exchanges. Must admit I find it ironic to see decentralised wallets suffer from similar flaws as centralised ones.
However, the big plus is this is transparent. No hiding it like Gox!

Disclaimer: I'm advocating fixing of the dao problem in Ethereum via a fork if necessary (I think it could have been attempted without, having said that). I also hold a fair amount of Bitcoin, I just consider them different applications. I also want to see a platform that absolutely won't do such things - I think there is room for both at this point, even if maybe only one will succeed. For me, it's a successful implementation of the EVM and associated safety standards I'd like to see most.
I'm pleased to see Counterparty do this but I'd like it to go further. Importantly, I think it important to define 'bug', especially as exploits can be 'deliberate bugs'. 
It isn't clear above whether a platform bug will result in any aid for the contracts affected, if possible.
There's also the question of whether there can ever be an ethical 'rollback' of any kind. For example, something that causes serious damage to the ecosystem or in real life.
So far no one has really discussed blockchain ethics (the above is a start) in anything other than simplistic terms.

Ethereum has some years of maturity to go, including security wise. It has to prove it even can be secure and provide secure apps, but judging it now is a bit silly, especially given how developers have taken to it as an ecosystem. If nothing else, it's a great place for experimentation.

Sorry to disagree but I can guarantee a mixing service hasn't been used yet by following the transaction (you can yourself too). I can't promise that the current move isn't a prelude to mixing or that 'wallets' haven't been sold on, but mixing hasn't happened yet. The funds have moved only once since the theft, which was last night. When mixing services are used, you can spot it straight away (at least, you can certainly spot mixing of some kind is happening, where by a mixer or a service which effectively does similar).
What I said about exchanges stands. Where there is a direct 1-1 link exchanges can see it. This is very different from when any amount of coin mixing has gone on. Sometimes the money shifts fast on a 1-1 basis, give or take, to try and take advantage of speed. Other times mixing services are used 1+ times over a period of time which frankly makes it all but impossible to track.

Sorry but it definitely is. Mixing services have not been used yet. Exchanges et al understand mixing services and coin taint sufficiently not to be confused by it.
Thieves get away with it because people assume that catching them is impossible. It isn't. The problem is also getting a conviction or money returned, but the last thing we should do is throw our hands in the air and give up.

Saying proof of stake won't work is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. What you mean, as a skeptic, is that proof of stake is unproven in the long run and existing versions have definite or academic flaws that may be too detrimental for use. All the same was said about bitcoin and it's still highly debatable about it's proof of work algorithm in the long run, at least in my mind. However, it's working well enough, which is the point. For now.

I was commenting only on you calling it a feature, and my comment was that the block size was set as an it'll do for now implementation rather than some highly planned and well thought out number.
You're also still misinterpreting what I'm saying. You're commenting as if I'm a supporter of XT and I've explicitly said I don't have an opinion either way and that's not my point in any case. I'm also not saying we need a decision for XT or not. This is not about deciding between A and B. This is about making decisions about how to progress. The content in the recent open letter from core dev will hopefully result in a step forwards in this respect. 
As you yourself said, if it's not a problem then that can be put forward and everyone can get on with things unless it becomes one. What we've actually got is a refusal to accept anything without 100% consensus, which doesn't seem like a realistic way to get things done in an area where even engineers can't agree because, honestly, no one actually knows what the best solution is - if they even agree there is a problem. You need some realistic way to make a meaningful decision.


Again, you're misrepresenting what I'm saying so the comment above is irrelevant since I wouldn't disagree with it. There is still *always* a balance to be achieved. Otherwise why 1 meg, why are fees set as they are, why 10 minute block times? It's a balancing act between usability and censorship resistance. 
I accept your view that 'raw' bitcoin should be for a 'select' bunch of people and uses, but I don't agree with it. Actually, no, I *am* prepared to agree with it if that's the consensus amongst core devs, miners and users. As things stand there seems to be a real conflict between bitcoin purests who believe it almost should never be changed (give or take) and those who think it should continue forwards. 
If future dev should be on alternative decentralised legders then that's ok but I think that should be clear. Bitcoin as a 'gold standard' of some kind is a perfectly valid use case. Similar if core dev agree that Bitcoin itself will not change any further other than 1-2 op codes, given sufficient research, to facilitate all the extra functionality and block size handling off chain - that's fine too. What's not fine is 18 months of bickering. That doesn't help anyone. XT itself has split the community in stupid ways - I'm not saying that's fine either, although at least it's now easy for miners to say yes/no to it or change their mind in future.
My view on how bitcoin should change going forwards may differ from yours, but I'm also completely ok with your view being the one that's taken forwards. My feedback is about the lack of process for decision making and the destructive and extreme approach of so many commenters on both sides. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 13:45:26
It's also the truth. They're not saying it should be that way but it's a constantly changing environment. Although Bitcoin is struggling a bit with that right now! Can RFCs be 'live'?

It's much more than a db checkpoint because everyone is running the software, can audit it and add their own. This confers quite a few advantages. Potential advantages I should say. The blockchain side (data + code) is highly secured, easily auditable (and small/modular), appendable with new code, consensus based, and separated from client layers. Very valuable. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 14:13:25
That's a good post - thanks. Yep, bitcoin is messy and both you and I have seen plenty of shit go down. That doesn't mean we should accept it 'as the way things are'. Best advise I ever had was to never accept someone saying that - it's just an excuse.

The ietf mention is interesting - ietf proposals can end up a compromised mess precisely because they try and please everyone to the extent that proposals can become a paper pushing mess, sometimes without proper final read throughs. Not dimissing them at all, they're important, but bitcoin could never have happened through the ietf and surely this tech is so new and unfinished that such an approach makes little sense. As technology matures and standards and interopoability take precedence over function and innovation, it makes much more sense. Bitcoin is just so immature - this whole sector is. 
We barely have any companies functioning commercially in this sector other than through vc funding. This is still the time for innovation (handled conservatively) in the core, not conservatism. Ethereum has many problems left to solve but by god it's light years ahead of bitcoin and with a vision, despite it's frankly terrible management until recently. 
I didn't read the wikipedia point as a criticism at all btw, just expressing a difference in management philosophy. 
Ietf and ouath 2: 
Having evaluated the resultant proposal, I have to agree with the issues raised in that post at the time. The result wasn't the best engineering solution at all, it was compromised to the extent that it's easy to implement with very poor security for no good reason, yet still be oauth 2 compliant. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 12:09:03
I'm really not. I'm expressing the view that there will almost always be technical objections. I can bring up any number of technologies and show a wide variety of experts who object - including to both the bitcoin proposal originally (barely anyone thought it would work) and to the cryptography used to this day (I know several professional cryptographers who are deeply unsupportive). Indeed, I met a very successful person in the field of consensus databases who has major technical objections to bitcoin's mining process and resultant economics. 
My point isn't to say all suggestions are equally valid because that's bullshit. It's to say that where you want engineers to agree, it's not as simple as getting 100% agreement - but that is the current model according to Wladimir. Correct me if I'm wrong for sure!
The lower the % agreement, the more agile and innovate one can be but the more risk one takes.
@_date: 2015-09-05 12:51:56
I agree that everything is a trade off. That's exactly why sometimes you will have irreconcilable differences. And I am familar with some of those areas fyi. I certainly don't mean to make out any of this is clear cut. That's kind of the point. 
What is the actual agenda you think gavin and mike have and why do you think?
Also, you haven't addressed my actual issue - you're approach to the problem has been personal and petty. Whether you're right or not, how about going about it more usefully than that?
@_date: 2015-09-02 11:53:13
You've argued coherently for one individual not leading as a valid way to do things but at the same time said why 100% agreement is impractical. 
In the end decisions get made, and they are not made only when everyone agrees because every project quickly gets to the point where 100% agreement from all parties isn't going to happen - and that's without dealing with leading edge software and algorithms! It goes to a vote or a lead. 
Some engineering problems don't have clear answers and agreement may never be reached - such as with the block size. So either developers give up or nothing happens. Developers giving up doesn't seem like a good way to achieve consensus - may as well insist on 90% vote (or similar) and then at least it's clear and they feel part of the system. 
The risks of a bad decision on bitcoin are serious, but requiring 100% agreement is impractical unless you're happy to only have minimal and exceptionally safe changes - eg security, or changes biased towards the remaining devs who are lead by their own views (or work). It's dishonest if it's only achieved by dissenting developers dropping out. 
Whatever is done, it does feel like a formal process should be followed in the event of major disputes - even if it is 100% agreement. At least that's clear.

Thoughts on ethereums potential model? Long attacks bother the hell out of me with proof of stake. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:37:06
The problem is evident. It's not a problem right now except when the network gets attacked (it affected various atm operators and traders fyi - transactions took too long). 
So by decision, it could even be along the lines of - once blocks are xx% full on average/median over y time then we want an implementation to deal with that in z months with a fallback to 2 meg blocks as a worst case scenario. This problem is entirely predictable in an engineering sense and has been known about since day 1. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 18:00:50
You don't trust them absolutely, you trust them to run a consensus network. I'd actually give them each a % of trust - proof of stake in a sense, and would monitor the network. Problems could be down to fraud so those running the node itself *need* to know when problems occur. It's not entire companies that commit fraud, it's individuals. This is still a block based consensus network, but you can call it a distributed ledger if it makes you feel better.
For example, I issue a new currency for use on a private blockchain. Will my partners trust me and my secure database (*cough*) or a network where they all run the banking software and can even bulk it up with their own smart contracts. I know which I'd choose.
@_date: 2015-09-06 09:09:50
I've been reading up as much as I can (paying the price with a lack of sleep now, gah). Not seen anything in the blogs, irc or mail lists to change my summary of what's actually happening - a serious conflict of opinion of how bitcoin should move forwards. 
XT looks like a misstep to me in terms of the splitting affect it's had. It also looks like the result of a long period of frustration. I'd heard last year that gavin wanted to do this (from another coin dev in a private convo) and was surprised and wasn't sure whether to believe it. However, I had thought then that bitcoin struggled to iterate somewhat due to many competing views on what it was and assumed that was why.
From that pov I do understand your frustration, and yes there was a lot done on blogs after a certain point. From my further reading, no I don't think they did the right thing but I understand why they feel they'd hit a wall. At the very least six more months wouldn't have hurt given that the affect on bitcoin goes well beyond blocksize. And yes, I do think they had decided to fork if nec a long time ago. 
Meanwhile, I also think some clarification is needed about bitcoin's direction purely because so many people are building on it, sometimes awkwardly and sometimes without real awareness, or have a business which eg does get screwed when there are transaction issues. This may take a fair while to agree but the lack of direction(ing) was part of the reason for this whole saga. Call it growing up troubles. Compromise is easier if you agree the general direction in advance, but at the moment it's so general it feels meaningless. This expands out to the general communication such as through the wiki (which was rather crap and misleading last I checked).
Read over your suggestion too. Quite neat, though I think reducing the size should have a hefty cost / median requirement as that could be highly disruptive. I think you are correct that pools would do the human thing and connect out of band and would take a very conservative threshold, being prepared to change it if it proved too high (or low). 
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:02:34
XT's solution is a temporary one (not currently taken up). BIP 100 ought to just be the start of discussion of how to properly solve it whilst we have a temporary solution so let's not totally shoot it down but rather iterate it.

Let's say you're right, and they are consistently lying, misrepresenting the truth, and have planned this all along - you're *still* making things worse and acting poorly in a public forum. That is not how you get your point across to the more serious readers. I'm glad I wasn't the only one to have noticed or been increasingly annoyed by it. Instead, you're stirring the pot and dividing the community just as much as you say Gavin and Mike are. Some people take what you say and run off screaming blue murder when that is not the case. You have multiple disagreements in an open source project, that's it. Stop making it personal and public continuously. Take it up with them privately or not at all. Shouting about it in public *does not fix it, it makes it worse*.
As it happens, you haven't managed to show censorship, lies or misrepresentation on any meaningful scale. What you've showed is disagreement and people who don't like each other, or the way they work at least. Although I found your posts awkward I did read what I could and I see a very passionate and seemingly talented engineer who has taken everything at volume 10 when it's actually volume 2 or 3. This is what happens when you get too close to things sometimes, and then let it spill over in public.
I read contributions from others in the community and although I may or may not agree with what they say, they put their point across by laying out the facts as they see them and, more or less, without being personal and shouting essentially takeovers and tactics. We have very talented engineers from a range of backgrounds and current commercial activities who sometimes cannot even agree on what happened yesterday - because we're all fallible human beings who see the world from *our* point of view. We may be wrong. We will be wrong a great deal of the time and should have some humility. Ironically, Mike showed that it one of his Medium posts over a disagreement he had with Gavin. They may have misstepped over XT (or at least the PR side), but equivalent missteps are being made by some of those opposing their fork. 
You would benefit from taking a step back, taking a deep breath, and letting go of whatever has caused all this anger. Then consider the affect you're having on everyone else. I can tell you feel passionate about this, but that passion is being directed in the wrong place. You, Gavin and Mike strongly disagree over a number of things - move on and just don't post anywhere near their (or XT's) direction. Keep on with your own contributions only. 
I promise you'll feel the better for it, whilst others of us will respect you - and what you say - a lot more. One day that may be important.

I'm not assuming 'fair play' - I've been around a long time and ran a studio for 20 years so I know how individuals play politics. This is also what you're doing incidentally - poorly and equally divisively amongst a different group.
Do you listen to people who talk coherently or who make personal attacks? 
That's what I'm trying to get you to understand. If you want to be heard, stick to writing clear blog/dev posts and stay away from personal attacks and snipey comments.
There is something in what you say, but (as I see it) *it's a major difference in opinion about how bitcoin should be run and go forwards as a project*. One group want to iterate quicker and take some risk to provide extra utility. Others think this is too dangerous given the current value of bitcoin, and prefer a very strict engineering and highly (perhaps 100%) consensus lead view. 
Both sides have pros and cons. Both are valid views. Both sides will use politicking to try and persuade people round.
It's a very big difference of opinion and yes, there will be a battle of wills about it because there is no correct answer. That's what you need to understand. If you think Bitcoin is best served in a particular way, fight for it - but do it the right way, not like this.

@_date: 2015-09-08 10:37:27
I said elsewhere and will repeat here, that this is a clash of opinion for how bitcoin should be taken forwards, and for whom. It may have been Greg Maxwell who pointed out that bitcoin supporters and devs come from a very wide range of viewpoints of what Bitcoin actually is and this can cause friction. It's critical to Bitcoin's future that there is clarity over Bitcoin's direction. The block size debate has shown up (in public) problems over the decision making process - although I know not everyone agrees since it depends how much you expect bitcoin to iterate. 
Most importantly, it's shown the problems caused by a lack of defining vision any more. Reading the dev list, as well as here to some extent, we have completely opposing visions e.g. Bitcoin should never change block size vs Bitcoin should natively scale up to VISA levels; raw Bitcoin should only be for hard core users vs Bitcoin should be for everyone; huge disputes over what centralisation vs decentralisation even means.
If we don't know where we're going, how can we possibly decide how to get there?
The block size debate and the XT split are symptomatic of lack of clarity and vision. Regardless of the technical discussion, regardless of whether XT should exist, regardless of whether we need a benevolent dictator, we need a vision. Not everyone will agree to it, that's impossible, but without a vision then Bitcoin is doomed to zig zagging around at the whim of whoever controls public discussion best or drags conversations out for the right or wrong reasons. Non contentious engineering decisions will be made very slowly and very little innovation will happen, if any, on native Bitcoin. If that's the vision, that's fine, but no one knows! The censorship problem here is another symptom of the same problem, all be it somewhat self-inflicted.
There are many facets to this discussion which are making things worse. On another thread I've been asking btcdrak to refrain from his personal and inflammatory attacks on Gavin and Mike, which do not do bitcoin or himself any favours. It's borne of frustration and what he says as lies and manipulation, of which I still simply do not agree.
I took the time to review a great deal of the dev posts/chat to try to understand his pov and it helps understand the nature of the debate in human terms.
Essentially his claim is that Gavin and Mike have conspired (using that word deliberately) to take over Bitcoin for a long time, and abandoned 'due process' such as posting on the mail list. Instead he claims they have systematically censored and manipulated the discussion in public forums.
There is some evidence for this, such as the lack of *another* block size debate on the dev list. However, there was IRC chatter and the blog posts were in public - and well publicised - so core devs were aware of it, but were taken aback by the sudden hard push that happened. Gavin and Mike making their fork was so divisive, however, perhaps it should have been at the end of the year if no decisions had been made. The ramifications have been so great that for once the technical side should have taken a back seat for a set period of e.g. 3 months. The fire could have been dampened for a while.
Additionally, the devs are accused of constantly writing bad code and making annoying pull requests. I've not reviewed the code or requests sufficiently to comment but I find that attack surprising and unlikely (in general terms - any one request may be poorly implemented of course).
On the subject of personal attacks, Mike himself has butted head with Peter Todd a few times and quite personally. I find Peter writes from a technical pov rather well but he can be rather *I'm right and you're wrong* about things, and obtuse in objections thus halting progress in favour of best rather than good enough.
I'd be in favour of core dev having a code of conduct - not censorship, but as a group they should come down on any known contributor making personal attacks, aggressive posts or claims of conspiracies. All 3 affect the rest of the community, some of whom pick up on these and run with them, such as has happened with the XT fork. This has resulted in censorship here and censorship of XT through DDOS attacks - absolutely the opposite of what Bitcoin is about.

I'm not sure quite how bizarre you're coming across. The above reads like a conspiracy theory. Weak and badly written code? 
So you're saying they're doing it deliberately and that bitcoin core can't see through bad proposals and code? None of that makes sense and I certainly haven't seen it backed by facts.
I have seen proposals accepted as a compromise instead of allowing discussions to continue seemingly forever with nothing happening, but that's a very different thing. You don't always get 'the best' solution because no one agrees what 'best' is. So you can either wait until everyone agrees (good luck, it probably won't happen which is our current problem) or you pick something, accept it's imperfect, and go with it. Some engineers are going to say you did the wrong thing, some will not, but that's progress.
I have also seen plenty of engineering disagreements between core (and other) devs. Happens all the time. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 18:06:19
This is a question I haven't been able to answer. So a blockchain is one possible solution to certain data and code, but how does it compare to existing distributed databases and code? Especially when blockchains will still typically only be a subset of data, with e.g. hashes referencing remaining data, and also quite significant privacy issues even on private networks.

No, no they really are not. This is a topic I know a lot about. There are almost no scientists in the entire world that deny climate change. There are very few scientists who consider that climate change isn't down to human beings. The trend has been in favour of climate change since the last 70s and it's years since it's been deniable scientifically.
There are a small number of vested interests who have spent a vast amount of money trying to put doubt in the public's minds (for their own interest) and whose 'facts' have never stood up to scientific rigour ever. There are way too many whackjob mostly republican (I don't know why, just seems to be true) politicians who deny it too.
In fact, the reason people get uppity about it is because they don't want to deal with the solutions. They may mean different behaviours, tax changes, are detrimental to some companies, and so on. The science says nothing about the politics, the science just says what's happening. Just because politicians get involved (as they have to) doesn't change the science.

Couple of things. You can still achieve consensus with a proof of work or (essentially) proof of stake algorithm but you only allow 'trusted' partners to run nodes. Any one or two of them could go rogue but the network achieves consensus. 
Rollback is prevented unless 51% agree, not dissimilar to bitcoin. The difference is all the nodes are known to each other and censorship or collusion is much easier - but in these cases this isn't their concern. 
The blockchain can and should be hashed to a public chain, eg bitcoin, very regularly, and can also be publically readable for transparency if privacy wasn't an issue or data suitably obfuscated where required - eg businesses sometimes have good or legal reasons for their trades not to be public and traceable (and sometimes not good reasons...).
This is just a highly specialised append only database where every transaction is cryptographically signed and where code can be provable and cryptographically associated with data operations (eg ethereum, simple bitcoin opcodes) - so nicely secure. Blockchains are also trivial to roll out onto new nodes for resiliency and blockchain users (code) know how to handle the concensus system as it's well defined. 
It's not anti bitcoin, it's a validation of the tech and a possible improvement in some sectors - unproven yet and I don't know how it compares to doing all the equiv dev and security (software, company) on a distributed database. Public chains should be used where we're all expected to just 'trust' a system already proven corrupt. Ahem, banking. In other sectors that's not the issue and it's not a public good, so the censorship resistance comes at too much of a high price vs benefits.

I wouldn't do proof of work personally but I can't rule it out completely. As for the rest, see my other message. I'm interested in learning the true advantages and disadvantages, including if blockchains aren't the way to do. So the more people like you can educate me, all the better. I do disagree with you about aspects of blockchains that are beneficial (over other cyrotographic techniques - mainly down to the core tech all being crypto based). However, I'd be telling porkie pies if I said I knew blockchains were either better or worse than distributed, journaled databases with a wedge of crypto controls.

Let me correct that for you. And I'm going to pick someone who already misreads the study to show why their own statement is foolish:
"43% of climate scientists agree we are 95% sure that man-made CO2 is the dominant driver of climate change".
- Nearly half of climate scientists are nearly 100% sure that Carbon Dioxide (which is only one of several greenhouse gases, and far less potent than many others) is the DOMINANT driver of climate change. 
"43% of scientists agreed with global warming"
- Global warming is not climate change. Science 101.
- Scientists said no such thing. Read the paper. You're just completely wrong.
In actual fact, they're completely misreading the paper and would fail a basic science class. The paper absolutely shows extremely strong consensus regarding climate change. What it details is the nuances of climate science. It says all of this if you read it.

There has been no decision made unless you count not doing anything about the known problem a decision. It's quite frustrating to see people using the same arguments again and again yet without genuinely taking the time to understand what's going on. This isn't about sides, it's about how Bitcoin development works - or, currently, doesn't work.
Bitcoin is a very unfinished piece of work, and we're not just talking about block sizes. It's critical for bitcoin that it can be allowed to move forwards. There's too little understanding amongst some of the more vocal people here of how immature Bitcoin is.
It's worth taking the time to read Mike's articles on this, and the arguments/counter-arguments on both sides of the debate. Whichever side you elect to support, decisions are not being made. I honestly don't know which of the proposals are better, but I do know that the status quo with regard to bitcoin development in general is leading bitcoin down a dangerous path, much more dangerous long term than making (informed) decisions and dealing with the results. 
In this case I know of multiple bitcoin businesses who literally had to shut up shop when the blockchain was attacked. They couldn't get transactions through. At the very least there should be some response to this from core in terms of establishing a timeline to test a solution, a fall back position, and so on. No one knows what the best answer is, but there isn't even an agreed timeline or set of approaches right now - just a bunch of people who have argued about it incessantly for a very long time.
As Bitcoin users, we should want and deserve better. Without progress, at some point I can see Bitcoin genuinely being forked, and really splitting the user base between those who don't want change and those who do.
This isn't about whether the XT approach to block size is the answer, it's about the lack of any progress whatsoever in terms of dealing with this problem and forward moving development in general.

You are correct that it's a feature which results from the current set up, ie incidental and not planned (quite the reverse). It was never intended as an ultimate feature of the system so let's not pretend it was. 
However, it's quite possible for a feature to come up later - including this. In fact I have I no problem if it's announced/agreed as a 'feature' core to bitcoin as that's a decision in itself. Then we all know where we stand and it may be that 1 meg blocks are kept but opcodes are added to allow other options. 
That's what I mean by decision - because at the moment it's just a big argument with people taking sides. A decision could just be that we'll have -some- decision in 6 months. Right now it's too open and that's part of the real problem - lack of clarity. 
As for the comment on fees - that really depends how you want to see bitcoin go forwards and is a matter of opinion. I honestly have no idea if that's the best way but it definitely precludes many people from using native bitcoin. Maybe they won't need to - maybe lightening or similar will be sufficient and somehow ops can be bunched together to predictably and affordably cover fees. 
Atms - they couldn't predict the fees. Users had similar problems. It's not as simple as pay more. And if it were, it's a trade off between utility and maybe centralisation (tho we feel very centralised already unfortunately).

I've been wondering about this too. It's not a bitcoin problem, it's everywhere online. A few loud people bully everyone else because they can't handle things not being their own way. It's happened in the game industry with pretty terrible, sometimes downright nasty and real world, results. It's what happens when a small number of people are able to dominate through attacks and rhetoric. Reasonable people walk away because they realise what a waste of time it is to engage and no one wants to walk into a wall of online abuse.

Btcdrak, you're posts are so disappointing. You appear to be a talented engineer but your posts regarding gavin and mike are not that of a professional. 
Sure, you disagree with them, but it's time to accept disagreement in good faith. I've read your repeated assertions about lying, censorship, and even mike's pull requests. They don't stand up to scrutiny because they're all distortions of the truth. They feel true to you I'm absolutely sure, but this is in your head. Gavin didn't censor you for example, he disagreed over where something should be posted. 
It's wrong for you to repeatedly personally attack someone in public for not agreeing with you, which is what you keep doing. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 17:10:21

Firstly, climate change is not global warming. Secondly, it is generally predicted that over an extended period of time a general warming of the atmosphere and/or oceans causes an increase in extreme weather conditions. I'm not sure you know what Climate Change means in a scientific context. The anthropogenic effect has to be teased out of the natural variation over a period of time. When you say natural variation, what do you mean? Temperature here ranges from -5 to 25 degrees perhaps, but human factors may move that e.g. 1 or 2 degrees over several decades. That may not sound much but it has rather large potential effects.
@_date: 2016-10-20 10:40:37

Your fact is 100% wrong. Read the paper, read my post. 
I'm not trying to be facetious either. The world would be a much better place if people learned to understand how to critique properly. 
You say you don't know whether climate change is real or not which is a great starting point. Now ensure you take the position that you'll have an open mind to it, not a decision made before the event. Then read the facts for yourself, even the actual papers and critiques of critiques. Look for facts not rhetoric. Look for proper use of data, not like the 43% figure above.

Read the paper. It doesn't say this. Once again, it actually says there is consensus amongst scientists, precisely the opposite of what you keep pointing out. It actually says it! The paper is free to read too so no excuses.
The paper doesn't speak to scientists *at all*, it's mostly a sociological review talking to people working in the petroleum sector. It's not even studying what you think it is. Most comedically, almost all of them agree that climate is changing and half believe it's due to man or aren't sure, but the paper isn't studying climate science anyway.

That includes some scientists too.
It's rather hard to make good decisions if you don't have and make appropriate use of the facts. Wilfully ignoring them is plain idiocy (a lot of politicians over a lot of things, from climate science to drug wars).
@_date: 2016-10-20 16:15:36
Yes, sure. Go on. Just make sure they're scientifically rigorous and not nonsense. In addition, let's say NASA have 1000 climate scientists and 50 disagree about climate change (stop saying global warming). That would be 95% agreement. If 50 of NASA's climate scientists said climate change is not happening out of a total of 100, over a long period of evidence collecting and the trend was towards discounting climate change, we should listen.

That no decisions have been made beyond 'no decision to do anything about the problem' is public knowledge. It's not me saying that, that's how it is. It's quite frustrating to have that kind of response because it's aggressive and unconstructive. You can be happy with bitcoin how it is but that's quite an extreme view. Many of the block size and side chains/trees proposals need changes. Bitcoin may need or benefit from various other changes. Are you not open to those? Do you not think there would be increased utility and adoption from some of these? Or decreased use by not iterating bitcoin at all in future? Genuine questions. 
Also, I never said it was a decision between those two options. Anything but! That's not what I referred to as a decision at all so please don't say as much.

I think this is the first time I've see people view ethereum correctly on this sub for a long, long time. Eth will have to continue to hard fork many times as it's just too complex not to. There will be both advancements and security updates for years. It's also correct to say that bitcoin, now anyway. cannot take much risk. Bitcoin works well enough now but it doesn't scale and it isn't flexible. However, it does need to be capable of change somehow else there is a chance it will just die. I never saw the issue with 2 meg blocks and think ot was a massive error of judgement not to can kick because of the social mess that resulted. I hope the two groups can stop throwing accusations at each other and compromise.

Ethereum can try it and if it fails then the community has an example to work from. Hammering an alternative for experimenting is daft. We want alts doing worthwhile things.

Only having one currency is a centralised point of failure, not just in development risks but also usage ones - e.g. tracking bitcoin used in gambling. I understand that only having one cryptocurrency is appealing academically but it's unrealistic and I'm not even sure it's a good thing.
If having multiple cryptocurrencies meant they were all valueless, we'd probably have known by now since they've been around almost as long as BTC. The fact that Bitcoin is still present and strong despite several other interesting cryptos (finally) and 100s more copycats indicates that human beings have essentially agreed to use it above others as their chosen store of value / black market currency.
Jon Matonis recently argued that there was only one TCP/IP therefore only one Bitcoin. Unfortunately he flunked the point - there are many protocols, each suited to different things, and many layers on each protocol. Litecoin or Dash may be used for laundering money around the crypto ecosystem. Putting ethics aside, that's utility and utility has value. In order to do this, the currency needs volume, so very few of the other currencies can do this. Endless supply does not apply to all the important economic factors, e.g. liquidity in this case.

Bitcoin is an amazing technology and a currency I'm vested in. It isn't the only one, however, and there are many others of interest even if eventually perhaps it'll all be done on sidechains or will fail. This constant stream of bile to other tech, much of which is not just clones or pump/dumps like the old days, is just crazy.

I'd put $500 in so you can learn and play within the Bitcoin ecosystem, have a go at exchange trading, buy a couple of cheap digital items such as from the Humble Bundle, buy some stock on bitfunder or btct.co.
Once you're comfortable, add some more funds. Do not panic *when* the Bitcoin price drops, possibly a lot, because that's the nature of the beat in the near term. Once you have Bitcoin, stay in Bitcoin (unless you want to gamble on the exchange rate).

Unfortunately that's not correct. Bitcoins are not public property, they belong to whoever owns the private key linked to the end of individual transaction chains. The blockchain is a transaction ledger, that's the public part.

Bitpay or Coinbase are good. Coinbase is fee free for the btc payment. Bitpay I don't know.
Cash out if you need the money, keep BTC if it's a small percentage of income and see it as a high risk investment. Btc is unlikely to provide much income at this point (I ran the bitcoin bundle for indie games such as world of goo).
Tax is usually at the time of the transaction. 
As far as I know you need to do sales tax yourself. We did vat for Europe.
If people over pay, we has to refund them. This may have changed or be due to change. Some people underpaid or fluffed their payment, but bitcoin makes it trivial to check :)

Short answer, no.
Long answer, nooooooo.
@_date: 2013-08-20 22:20:09
Bitcoin itself is entirely open source and has had 4 years of hack attempts which could make someone a lot of money. That doesn't mean it is 100% secure, but it's a good test. It's more likely an exploit would get into an update.
Bitcoin's weakness is wallet implementations. In this case, it was with the random number generators used.
I'd also add that Bitcoin is a long way from finished. Getting security right is one of the reasons why it isn't ready for mainstream consumer use.

There is no news beyond there are ways of doing it - blockchain.info already estimates taint. No one wants it. No one at the Foundation is arguing in that it needs to happen (AFAIK, and if so they are a small minority).

But Spike, he loves you!
(Now you're thinking, if only the tipbot allowed coins to be removed from a person)
@_date: 2013-05-26 09:57:00
As I said, I've not looked into the implementation but I would assume change addresses are thrown away when 'empty'. That aside, what you said is true.
The blockchain isn't a list of who owns what (directly), it's a list of transactions. Whoever is at the end of a transaction chain controls the coin. Change addresses are needed because people transfer multiple coins or fractions of coins. If I'm at the end of a chain with my 1 coin, and I want to send 0.2 BTC, I actually have to send my 1 BTC. This is because only the ends of transactions are used (outputs) to track the currency. You can't 'leave' money there.
What happens is you need to create two new outputs from the original output. Think of it as splitting your coin in two, where one part goes to the destination and one part goes back to a 'return' or 'change' address. With a bank account, you just send the precise amount to another account, but we don't have accounts in Bitcoin, only transactions and addresses for who is allowed to add another transaction to that chain. 
Addresses aren't accounts - which is what is weird because it feels like they are to us lowly humans!
Bitcoin doesn't know what address you sent from because you don't actually send from an address, confusing as that may sound. You send from an output, or bunch of outputs (the transaction end points). An address is associated with one or more outputs and simply say 'to use these outputs (to spend money), the owner of this address needs to sign the transaction'.
So when you send money from blockchain, it can pull outputs from any number of outputs you control (where each output is tied to an address somewhere, sometimes the same one) so sum up to the amount you send.
That's confusing but if you draw it out on paper, it does show that Bitcoin doesn't know what address you sent from because the concept of an account doesn't actually exist! There are simply coins you control and coins you don't (or parts of coins).
So when you send money anywhere, you also send a return address. Any change is sent back to this address. In our example, I send 1 Bitcoin but I set 1 output as 0.2 (and the target address) and I set 1 output as 0.8 (and the return address). Applications can choose to set the return address to one the user knows about too, but it's less anonymous to do this which is (I believe) why it isn't standard. 
It's very confusing for people that Bitcoin works like this and it needs to be hidden away far more than it is now.
(Apologies if any of this is slightly imprecise)
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:51:24
This post is completely OTT. Mike asked for a discussion on the concept and that discussion is important. He didn't push blacklists, he presented an existing problem and an example of handling it - not saying he wanted it. 
Before anyone asks, I'm totally against any form of blacklisting but there is an underlying issue that needs discussion. That also should not be confused with the identification issue also being discussed.

@_date: 2013-11-17 14:32:23
Yeah I agree totally. The fact that they have even come out today with this makes it easy to show the US how futile strict controls would be. Far better to use light regulation such as with exchanges and certain high value transactions. For example, in the UK you can't buy a house with cash or large amounts of savings without evidencing where it came from. This is for taxation and laundering purposes. Not arguing the rights and wrongs, only that this is the status quo and I would want to see nothing worsening the situation.
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:07:54
Firstly, it looks like it works! Good start.
Security: There are a myriad of security issues here, especially add-ons. I am dubious about extensions now that I'm using Bitcoin, but this site is especially vulnerable.
Positives: Very easy to use and I think it'd be very good for quick tasks and as a very short term address.
If you try and transfer too much out I would warn the user that they don't have enough funds. I don't believe I had any UI feedback. I would also have the mining fee as optional but default to on, and give a warning when turning it off.

Bitcoin won't get anywhere close to $10,000, or even $1,000 until the regulatory situation is clear in the USA (or in a multitude of other countries as the alternative). If the US came out and said Bitcoins are legal but if you want to turn it into fiat you need to use a fully approved exchange, and you must declare Bitcoin holdings to the IRS, then watch the price rocket. Until then, it's risk risk risk.

Nope because altcoins can be built on and any crypto that wants to work in the real world will be subject to the same regulations. Sure there will always be blackmarket alt coins but 99% of the world will use the legal one. I'd rather that one not come from the US gov or a bank.

No, some altcoins are and some aren't. Some are well thought out and interesting in their own right, while others are basically money making schemes. Weak minded are those who won't critically analyse but would rather make broad statements. Also, the true value of LTC is not 0, nor is the true value of BTC 0. The true value is what it is now, $3ish. If it were on more exchanges it may go up or down, I can't say, but to say it's 0 is to misunderstand the fundamental economics completely. And also Litecoin, which is one of the interesting currencies.

This is what I proposed:
The below is an idea I've been mulling over for a while in some form, a way to make good use of the fact that we have an inflating currency. To be clear, it is only a concept - it's not happening unless people want it to happen.
Inspiration: The Wellcome Trust, but for science/tech as a whole and science engagement.
PROPOSAL: The Satoshi Science and Technology Trust (SSTT)
A global charitable foundation dedicated to furthering knowledge and improving the well being of humanity through scientific research and education.
KEY FOCUS POINTS
Targeted research with a clear benefit to humanity
Theoretical research to further human knowledge
Identification and sponsorship of outstanding researchers and technologists
Improving public engagement and science education worldwide
Independent of both political and commercial interests.
A friend always asks me what I want to do in life if money was no object; if I could go off and do anything I wanted. Eventually I worked it out.
I want to get people excited about science and technology.
I want to ensure good science continues to be done.
I want to find to enable the best people to find solutions to major problems, both in theoretical and practical disciplines.
I'd really like to see a revamped World's Fair type event, full of inspiring people, experiments and technology!
(My friend said - "I want to bring the moon buggy back to Earth")
Bitcoin has the power to do bring about change on many fronts. In this case, planning and fund raising now could bring about important advances in the future. 
WHY BITCOIN?
It dawned on me that small donations now would lead to a large fund later. The trust wouldn't move into operational mode until a pre-agreed target, while the legal structures would be in place to protect the funds accordingly. With a Bitcoin Bank hopefully on the way, Neo, the funds can be safely stored under a multi-sig and legally compliant environment.
HOW WOULD IT BE FUNDED?
It would request sponsorship and backing from the Bitcoin community, both businesses and individuals. If 1000 people donated 1 Bitcoin, that could be worth $10-$100,000,000 in a few years. Of course I'd like to see more than that raised, but I feel that 1000 is a great first target.
WHAT NEXT?
This is just an idea. For it to happen it needs people, supporters, to put a framework together.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:49:59
There's no evidence for this at all. You're being paranoid and not looking at the facts. In order to debate you need to understand how such systems would work, particularly if forced upon businesses without affecting the underlying Bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 15:56:21

@_date: 2013-05-26 23:20:02
The payment protocol Gavin suggests is in progress is a much better and non centralised solution. Also, random unused addresses are brilliant for merchants as we can track transactions super easily; I'd hate to lose them.

Bitcoin talk - the securities section, bitfunder thread.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:10:43
It didn't need to leak. It was just a discussion point like any other legal discussion they have on there. It's private only in the sense that you have to pay a few bucks to join, which keeps the signal-noise ratio down in such discussions. We can see from the uproar how impossible a serious discussion would be to have on Bitcointalk these days.
If you read the raw posts, you can see how high quality the discussions are, give or take the 1-2 people who reacted Bittalk style rather than understood what the point was. 
Of course all these things are discussed, including by the bitcoin developers. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 01:47:58
Bitcoins are taxable I'm afraid. The details depend where you live but, at the very least, they are considered barter transactions which are taxable in at least some territories (if not all).
There is a lot to agree upon still, but Bitcoins aren't a way to avoid tax unless you intend on not declaring them, which is no different to cash in hand.
@_date: 2013-05-26 16:48:32
No, it will just mean it's not worth using by a large audience or many merchants. Being able to exchange fiat for Bitcoin is extremely important for everyone other than a hardcore group of users.
It should also be remembered that this isn't (yet) about Bitcoin, it's about money laundering. All that's happening is anyone exchanging fiat for Bitcoin needs to conform to the national regulations for AML, which is not a bad thing.
@_date: 2013-05-26 23:04:27
Same as any money laundering. If the taxman finds you have had money that you didn't declare, you just failed as a money launderer!
They wont find BTC but that's only ok if you can use those BTC. Not only that, but use them so that you don't end up with an asset which you couldn't possibly have bought otherwise (as this would indicate undeclared income).

Sorry, this is either flame bait or you've been drinking the wrong cool aid. Taxes are payable in Bitcoin just as if you receive apples in payment. Yes, even the apples would be taxable.
Bitcoin is a digital cash equivalent, not a credit card or currency replacement - please read Satoshi's original paper. There are important differences. Countries could use it alongside their regular currency but the nature of Bitcoin means that it can't replace cash in the foreseeable future, if ever. This could be great for smaller countries in particular.
Bitcoin is an amazing effort and is the first even vaguely successful digital currency because it is not centralised, but it is not going to change the world like you think.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:04:23
BIP32 doesn't fix the problem as far as I can tell. Greenlisting can be done in quite an interesting way, not as basic as a simple address. I've certainly designed a system to do it which BIP32 can't fix and which allows me to track money everywhere. Beyond that, the new addresses can be tracked as they're change addresses.

3) That's my point but I didn't express it well, my apologies. Many transactions could be handled off the block chain in future.
4) It certainly isn't a zero probability but I think it's a very low probability. I think that Bitcoin would survive such an attack even if there were to be a nasty short term effect. Firstly, Bitcoin can adapt pretty quickly, secondly I think this is where a few strong alternative currencies are needed to take the strain off Bitcoin and explore a few other avenues (which Bitcoin can then follow). I think there are enough eyes to spot an attack very quickly BTW.

UKYO Post:
Finally have an update.
After trying and trying, and talking to sipa in 
[13:34] &lt;Ukyo&gt; hey guys. I got an issues with bitcoind. a. wallet size causes it to take 5~10 miuntes to load. b. as soon as send is issued, it maxes cpu/ram until restarted, and takes about 10~20 minutes until it announces to the network
[13:34] &lt;Ukyo&gt; and then rpc times out after that
[13:34] &lt;sipa&gt; how many keys/transactions?
[13:34] &lt;Ukyo&gt; over ten thousand easily
[13:35] &lt;sipa&gt; there have been some improvements to that recently in head
[13:36] &lt;Ukyo&gt; so this is kind of a known issue for the size? i.e. bitcoind isnt really meant for the size and its something being worked on?
[13:37] &lt;sipa&gt; it wasn't designed for it, no
I wanted to say thanks real quick to Warren on irc who is a Litecoin dev who is helping me to straighten this out and make sure there is no problem in the future.
As it stands, I have started initiating manual withdraws. It takes about 20 to 30 minutes between each one as mentioned in the above irc quote so please bare with me
for a bit. We are going through tickets trying to get things caught up in proper order for fairness. If you get your withdraw, please post and let people know.
I will continue to work on this 24/7 excluding unintentional sleeps as I have been for the last week now. I hope to get all withdraws caught up very shortly.
Thank you for your patience and understand,

It's an interesting edge case but it won't be fought on the nature of public/private keys. It's sort of like ending up with the same key to a car. Coins that were meant for you are still yours; coins that were meant for the other party are still theirs. The coins were not public property, it just meant they were put in a bucket which more than one party had access to - unintentionally.
Under normal circumstances, the bucket is a safe to which only you have a key. However, it's possible for someone else to end up with the same key. If they do, they can actually see that the key has already been used simply by checking the address. That does not mean the money is theirs. Taking coins in that address would still be theft.

Our developer lead bundle has the following stats:
430 orders
11.7 BTC after VAT
1 BTC largest payment (well known Bitcoiner)
Average: 0.03 (lots of 0.01 BTC buys)
Costs: Approx 3500 Euros. I could have done it much cheaper but I wanted a good system that could be expanded in future, an indie dev working on it, a nice design, and Andreas has done a great job. I always accepted I was going to pay for this out of my own pocket.
Revenue is split equally amongst developers, with 10% towards my costs and 10% to the EFF (who now accept Bitcoins!).
Expectations: 250-2000 sales, 10 BTC-50 BTC. So we hit our lower end but I would have liked to hit 20-25 BTC.
Positive feedback from bitcoiners although I think a fair few were at the conference when this was announced so we probably missed some higher rollers. Since it wan't our intention to target them but to promote Bitcoin discussion amongst gamers and devs at the same time it doesn't matter, but we will have missed a few higher donations.
The Humble Hundle has more in one donation from at least two Bitcoiners that we have in total ;)
Mainly negative feedback from gamers who thus far think Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme and are unable to grasp the exchange rate situ: "$100 for a Bitcoin? No way!". We have much education to do. I have been accused several times of trying to lull people into Bitcoin and profiting at their expense. Mildly annoying but to be expected.
Other Comments: Lack of coverage in gaming places, but that's partly down to the games being old and partly because the Humble Bundle allowed Bitcoins a few days before us. This was an experiment so older games being an issue was always going to be the case.

Bitcoins are assigned to the a block in the Blockchain when they are mined. Bitcoins are mined when a block is confirmed, and a block contains a collection of bitcoin transactions. Block confirmation involves checking that transactions are valid, and doing a mathematical task. This task is like a lottery done by miners; the winners are random but miners with faster hash rates are more likely to win. It's like buying more lottery tickets (asics are like buying huge numbers of lottery tickets at present).
When you make a transaction, like paying someone, a link is created from those original coins, or more usually the coins last transactions, to a new public address. This link (tx) is verified by miners on the peer to peer network as part of the block creation process.
When you own Bitcoins, what actually happens is that a number of these transactions are linked to your public address, and no new transactions have been linked to them. That means they haven't been spent, so you must own them! If a new transaction is linked to them, they had to be signed by your private key so you must have spent the coins, and their new public key is their new owner. So what you own is not Bitcoins really, but the end points to very long transaction trails (which finish associated with your public address). The sum of these is your balance.
This ignores double spend issues which are when someone tries to spend the same coins twice, so their transactions would have two paths - it's like trying to pay two different shops with the same ten dollar note. Bitcoin uses a system of confirmations to prevent this. Only one path is allowed, usually the first one that received a confirmation.
More or less. I think.

To be fair, they offer a dimple, free service, there is plenty info on their site, and this is a user error they can do nothing about (if a serious one).
This isn't a blockchain.info problem, it's a fundamental Bitcoin one.
Change addresses may be more secure but they are too complicated for almost all users in reality.
Deterministic wallets are the way to go to make Bitcoin more popular, except for savings accounts which are rarely used.
Is Electrum deterministic by default? Do you only need to backup once / do you only need the initial keywords?
On savings accounts, back ups should be suggested after every X transactions and on every single new address creation [unless the user turns this option off].

That's not true is it? You had to be verified if you wanted to work with certain amounts of fiat.
I think this is a very good move and long needed. Whilst there may be exchanges who can deal with anonymous users, the larger exchanges absolutely have to comply with regulations. Not doing so puts all of its users at risk.

Some wallets actually route it back to the address you said it sent from, if you chose a send from address. Wallets often show you your total amount but its spread across addresses that are usually hidden from the user. This is why backups are important - qt defaults to 100 of these, and it adds new ones as old ones get used (aids anonymity). So if you don't back up when it's added new ones... Bam!
Or use a deterministic wallet :)

It's time to put a stop to this crazy witch hunt and misinformation that's going around. I've posted up a summary of the Foundation discussions so that everyone can see what's being said. Someone else made the raw sources available so I cribbed from those (I'm not a Foundation member for reasons I post about later in the thread). I didn't cherry pick - this is a genuine good set of posts reflecting what's going on.
TL:DR Vehemently against taint, blacklists, and so on. Mike asked for a discussion so the Foundation could react when asked about it, and before an organisation waltzes into congress with a solution that destroys us all (as we saw yesterday). 
A small number of people got very upset at the idea of an open discussion and immediately went on the public war path saying Mike was in favour of this. This was not only not true but became a highly personal attack and disruptive to the whole idea of free speech and open discussion.
(Phew, sorting all those posts out was tiring!!!)

No offence but absolutely no one properly involved in bitcoin recommends PayPal. What's more, chargeback is almost always the norm in these cases so it sounds very weird that you couldn't get your money back. You also wouldn't buy any other currencies over paypal. 
There is no such thing as free money. If you think there is then of course you will get bitten. Mining is fine but you have to do the maths to see if it is profitable. 
I'm sorry you had a bad experience but this sounds odd.

BitBargain does the job in the UK.
What about elsewhere in Europe?
@_date: 2013-05-24 22:31:35
I'll bite.
1) No, it's risky to hold unless you're good with security, and there many things in the works to handle that in a big way.
2) There is a consumer issue but you actually just gave one of the reasons TO use it (no fees). The consumer issue is actually commodity vs currency, particularly in the West where we have stable currencies.
3 and 4) You need to learn about how the blockchain works and about how Bitcoin is developed. The devs do need to address an aspect or two of the blockchain and it's already planned. Governments starting ASIC projects won't kill the blockchain or Bitcoin. Worst case is they can fudge the network briefly. There are contingency plans to deal with this sort of thing and the core crytpographical algorithms can eb change to block ASICs relatively quickly if needed.
Edit: Another fix for bloat will come out of other developments, such as Open Transactions.
None of this is to say Bitcoin is here to stay, but the technology and principle certainly is.

Ah, actually I guess it can only happen if you can attempt a double spend, which you definitely can't without special support in software.
Paying twice 'from the same address' is not a double spend, and it's not always easy to do in any case due to how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:36:24
I've never considered this. If you double spend to the target address, and the non-fee one gets there first, does the miners fee get sent back as well?

Much of what you just posted is incorrect. He sold his entire ipo very quickly (the other 15m shares are his profit share once the ipo price is repaid in divs), VMC dividends don't pay really out until the end of the year (some Avalon mining was planned but avalon blew up), the ipo paid the nre and he is yet to say anything at all about sales, active mining own VMC and active mining were the ipo company (which is clearly stated). Issues surround communication and marketing.
@_date: 2013-09-06 22:00:15
Maths is wrong. 10M meaningful shares until 0.0025 BTC paid back per share (which is also the current share price on Bitfunder!) giving a cap of $2.5-3m. They are building hardware, will mine, and have a chip deal with possibly the best 28nm firm.

It's more traceable to do that so lessens anonymity. It doesn't change the fee situation either since you'll pay them when doing that, or if you don't pay a fee you may have to wait a while for your money.
The real answer is to have your change returned to a selected address. Blockchain.info may allow that (I think you can definitely send from a particular address and use a paper wallet in this way). Same traceability issue tho.

For low value transactions you are probably safe from double spends, at least enough not to worry about it at the moment, so some people accept them. For online transactions it's almost always acceptable to wait a few minutes (10 on average).
Other coins can be processed faster, and ripple/OT may be used to do much faster and lower risk spends in future (OT can offer this to bitcoin).

They got to my support request after a few days and unlocked it. However, I now have more money locked up and am unable to transfer any money out whatsoever.

The split is organised so 10% goes to the costs of the site and back-end etc, which are not high but neither are they negligible. Everything else goes to the developers/EFF. The total revenue will be over the costs, but that's not how we're splitting it as that didn't make sense.

That wallet will be totally unencrypted - be really, really careful. Lots of viruses/spyware will just nab it the moment they see it. I'd grab it while offline, import it on an absolutely CLEAN computer (or read up on doing an offline signed transaction), and move it to a new secure wallet or paper wallet. That old wallet is unsafe - it's almost like leaving $50k lying around in a public place once you're online with it.

3) Read up on Open Transactions. Ripple is next on my reading list but my understanding is that it can work alongside Bitcoin but it could replace it for some things. However, in my view Bitcoin is not a great daily-use currency for the masses but a great reserve currency or commodity. That's for another discussion. OT, however, is potentially a game changer again. It would work really well with Bitcoin and other currencies. OT is complex to explain and understand at first though.
OT would also incorporate Ripple most likely, it's not one or the other (as with Bitcoin) and nor is Ripple the anti-christ people make it out to be (haven't evaluated the tech, just talking in terms of OpenCoin).
4) It is possible, yes. It would have a short term effect and potentially be very bad for the government that did it should they get found out because essentially it is a currency attack. That would have all kinds of political ramifications. It would also be short to medium term. Once someone does it, you know that systems will be designed to make it vastly more difficult in future. There are already plenty of design suggestions and some implementations that work differently or have no proof of work.
No one knows what is best or what will win out because this is about human beings, economics, a developing technology, and has no borders. Interesting times.

Bigger games may prefer their own currency because they can have more control. However, many titles would work well with bitcoin once it's more mature. There are issues to resolve with the core technology and getting hold of them yet. 
The issue is going to be that companies such as Apple won't allow it as it breaks their business model. I'm sure they will accept bitcoin payments themselves though, so sort of the same thing.

It's a bit more complex than a simple premine, however I'm evaluating it myself so I am far from an expert. Not sure about it at the mo. High risk. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 23:01:55
What you say is a very, very long term prospect and probably beyond my life time, if ever. There is massive friction to deal with, much of it for very good reasons. Bitcoin is, I'm afraid, set up in such a way as to make it more of a commodity than a currency. That's not a bad thing, it's just part of the grand new experiment. And no one really knows :)
Look at the 6 month chart and you can see a very clear pattern actually. If it pans out, we'll be back at 200-250 at the end of the year in a stable form. It's still going to largely depend upon external factors, such as fiat issues which are currently getting worse and not better. The price can't go up if money doesn't enter the system.

Mike does not equal the foundation and he wasn't arguing to do it. He was looking to discuss the options and giving an example of how such a system could work. He is, I accept, clearly uncomfortable with everyone knowing about stolen money and being unable to stop it, but I think he is wrong in thinking a technical solution can fix it. Human beings have to be involved and it'll be corrupted.
Law enforcement has to be kept away from Bitcoin other than where it can actually make sense, e.g. KYC at exchanges, probably KYC for big commercial transactions.

You beat me to it. It's too nascent at present but it shows promise.

Initially, I'm looking for like minded individuals capable of working together to put the structure together, from a legal and operational point of view. After that, it would need to be promoted in the press and at conferences, along with a variety of fund raising activities.

I've edited the leaks and posted those edits on the forum thread to try and educate users and stop the witch hunt.

No one wants this! No one has argued for it!
@_date: 2013-05-27 10:40:12
Regarding mbtc, this has to be consistent on more sites. In particular, coinbase would need us to be able to price in mbtc as we have no control over that. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:19:17
No this doesn't work for any number of reasons, not least the international nature of bitcoin and the fact that it's a highly regressive tax.
The last point is correct though and is likely to be a big use a few years down the line.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:00:04
Wrong. I'm trying to get people to read and not act as if they are watching Fox News. Where are they talking about how to combat people fighting against a blacklist? I found very little in support of it at all (if anything) other than suggestion why there is a problem worth discussing - because regulators are going to point at things like cryptolocker and use it against us. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:05:31
Then you didn't read the thread properly where no one wants to reduce anonymity. If anything, the opposite.

You definitely want to use BitBargain if you're in the UK. Quick and has a decent escrow system.

It really needs to come from gamers (especially as I am rather spam conscious). We have had topics and they tend to get very downvoted and a lot of anti bitcoin stuff (same on forums).  It's interesting and very much a part of the experiment. I'd like to do another one once bitcoins are a bit easier to get hold of, and where we go for more exposure. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:17:40
CoinValidation doesn't need a protocol change. It can be build on top and required by the US gov to any business accepting any cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin. That's why the Foundation need to have such discussions to they can say why it's a really bad idea, else regulators will just say yes to it because it sounds amazing.
The Foundation need to come out in no uncertain terms about this though.

Another investor here. I've spoken to Danny in person on more than one occasion and I'm increasingly impressed with this operation. There are risks for anyone trying to do with Neo are, but fortune favours the brave. As investments go, there isn't a better one at this point in time. As usual though, at your own risk etc.

One member is not happy about the quotes so I've offered to remove his, but I maintain that it was the right thing to do given the information was public, names removed, and the original posts were only under a community level wall essentially.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:34:24
They will try and exert control, yes, which is why the Foundation is having the discussion. It is categorically not the Foundation argueing to do it. In fact, virtually everyone argued against it.
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:30:08
What you say is missing the entire point of what I posted. It's not about coin validation etc, it was about people being lead up the garden path like the pied piper about the foundation and Mr Hearn. 
That's a different topic. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:30:36
See my posts in the thread for why the discussion is important and why it's not been done in public (rightly or wrongly).
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:01:37
No they aren't. Have you read the forum posts that were leaked? Virtually every post after mike's OP was against blacklisting et al. There are no implications, it's a small number of people upset at discussing it and a couple more stirring whilst then promoting their own alts (which at least one admitted he wants to commercialise).
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:28:40
Please, please read my counter post, and I've also posted huge sections of the leaks on that forum thread to show how people are being completely mislead about what's going on within the Foundation. 
Everyone is reacting without actually checking the facts, so someone had to take the trouble to post them in an easier to read manner.
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:38:09
It's basically random, in that you have no control over it. Could be as quick as any other transaction, could be a couple of days, or you could be really unlucky and it could take rather longer.

Worst thing is she cried off sick, so I'll try again next week. However, another rather good artist has had the prod through a friend of mine :)

NxT isn't premined and it will be open source in a few days. Wait until then to judge it, which is what I am doing. It's not heavily hyped and has several potential improvements over bitcoin.

When you receive lots of small payments, such as from a faucet, each one takes a little bit of space.
If you then want to send a much larger amount, which will be made up of lots of smaller amounts, most wallets (by default) will calculate the transaction fee. This fee is based on the amount of little payments that it needs to sum together to make up your new transaction.
The fee isn't compulsory. What it does is pay miners to process your transaction. If you don't pay the fee, your transaction is a lower priority. Instead of being processed in the next few blocks, where a block takes 10 minutes on average, it will only be processed when a miner has spare capacity. The more small amounts involved, the slower that's likely to be as the miner has to do more work confirming your transaction and isn't being paid for it. So it could take a few minutes but it isn't unheard of for it to take 2 days.
Some wallets let you choose whether to pay a fee or not.
A common misconception is that Bitcoin addresses are like bank accounts but they are completely different. In fact, transactions are linked to this address. When you are paid from a faucet, your address becomes associated with an awful lot of transactions, which is quite different from an 'account' containing a certain amount.
Disclaimer: This is a plain English explanation! Well, an attempt at one.

Hey, I'm not saying it'll work. I think it'll just be the start of a crazy tech war like the drug war etc etc etc.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:27:02
People like to say that but actually no, it won't work. If my business is mandated to do it and I'm in a country where it's required, I either refuse and shut down (and possibly go to jail) or I do it. Most users - if Bitcoin gets big as a method of transacting online - won't care. They won't understand why it's bad because they'll only know that criminals can have their money confiscated etc.
So it's more important to educate regulators as to why it's such a bad idea and why it's really just playing into criminal hands, let alone the massive privacy issues.
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:11:02
No because zero coin is likely to be illegal to use in certain place, I.e. The US, but that won't stop people using it outside of US merchants. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:06:17
This is pretty damn good! Maybe some more room with the share price too then.

That's the safest thing. Blockchain.info has this as an option. 
I don't know what the precise implementation is but normal users would probably be fine backing up every few transactions (probably quite a few but it depends on usage I think).
