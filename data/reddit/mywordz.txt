OP's post is the reason bitcoin is going downhill. Fuck me for trusting a company worth half of a billion dollars to do my trading.

I think the reward outweighs the risk in this case. 
If they permanently hold withdraws, you are out $125 per coin.
If they actually resolve the issue, and resume business, then the coins might be worth over 5 times that much once they open it back up.
Its so difficult to tell though! This will surely make some men VERY rich.

Sounds like all of @_date: 2014-02-14 09:41:07
MtGox halts Bitcoin withdraws to fix an error. An understandable move if they are experiencing issues with the system. Other exchanges follow, but lets keep the attention on MtGox.
99% of Bitcoin users unaffected(because we ALL know we just let it sit there). The Bitcoin traders and panic sellers who sold are to blame for the new worth. But no, let's blame MtGox for this price drop.
Let's get off this "Screw MtGox" cirlejerk, because at least they had the balls to admit a flawed system, and are attempting to fix it.

This community is shit.
Kicking dust in the faces of the people who lost so much is not a classy move. I used GOX since it was in the sidebar and supposedly trusted. This circlejerk will be the end of bitcoin.

Even if you are being downvoted, you are still right. 
Not too long ago, Gox was on the sidebar as a trusted site to trade coins. And now the community is okay with calling people who lost their coins, idiots.

What the fuck is wrong with this sub-reddit??
We are featured on weekly, and we circlejerk like assholes. 
MtGox told everyone about the fucked up Bitcoin code, and is being blasted and called a liar, even after other exchanges have confirmed the same thing.
The Bitcoin community is what will end up ruining it. Stop the circlejerk and grow the fuck up.

I suppose if someone believed that, it would not make sense to buy. But either way, its a gamble. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:22:12
What kind of future planning you you recommend since you are SOOO great at this whole thing. They are an exchange trying to do what is best for their customers, and if there is a vulnerability in the system, the right move is to correct it and move on. Meanwhile they will put what is causing the issue on pause for a short time.
In the end, you can complain all you want, and be one of the guys who bitches because he bought a Starbucks coffee on his way to work, or you can stop using their service. Whichever you think will help you, go ahead.

Thanks for explaining.

A current conversion rate would be neat.

Not very related question.
So, when I pay using bitcoin, The company trades the btc back to the countries currencies in order to do more business. Doesn't that hurt the rate of the BTC? 
Wouldn't the price of btc keep going down the more we use it??
For example; Store sells product for 10 btc, then sells the 10 btc on mtgox for the the highest amount someone is willing to buy btc. Wouldn't that keep the price pushed down? 
I imagine the more we use btc to buy and sell, the less the value will be.
Maybe the fault of btc. 
I'm not saying don't invest(as I have my fare share as well), but isn't that a flaw in it?

Its funny because the price will drop below 300.

You've been trying to troll this subreddit every day for the last 5 months. What do you have to gain from this?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:08:12
This circle jerk mentality needs to stop.
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:29:03
I was right there with you. That trade cost me 4 bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:57:15
Lets hope the price gets down to 600! I would buy 10 more in a heartbeat!
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:43:22
Very true.
@_date: 2013-05-27 09:28:41
Or you can down vote me I guess...
