hhhmm if i received the change back then why is there a wallet  with the change value still in it? My QT wallet on block chain shows a total payed in and a final balance, if you subtract the latter from the total payed in then you get 0.0751192 this means I have not received my change.

Here is the best description given to me to understand exactly the same situation.
"A wallet is not an address. A wallet contains many addresses. The address that the change was sent to. should also be in your wallet, though you might not be able to see it. Your total wallet balance should include the change.
Go to Help &gt; Debug Window &gt; Console and then type listaddressgroupings to see a listing of all addresses in your wallet."
