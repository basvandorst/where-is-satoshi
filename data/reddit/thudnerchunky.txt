Well the big whales cannot spend their BTC now without devaluing it. Any prudent investor would want to diversify their funds and not have 90% of their wealth ties up in one asset, with the BTC whales they do not have a choice at the moment. They simply cannot liquidate a significant amount of their BTC without devaluing it.

Buffet likes to invest in things that are productive and under valued (companies, farmland, etc.). I think it's pretty obvious he wouldn't be interested in BTC, notice that he also says to stay out of cash though. Bitcoin does have utility as a decentralized digital currency but I'm still trying to wrap my head around how evaluate its price. Certainly the future price has to do with how widespread it will be adopted, it's limited inflation property, and I suppose competition from other crypto currencies. It seems highly speculative to me as an investment, much easier to buy stock in a well run company.

Amazon lost 95% of it's value during the dotcom crash. It took 10 years for those people that got caught holding the bag to get their money bag. Ebay did better, it only lost 50% of it's value and only took 3 years for the bag holders to get their money back. The smart money was not in tech stocks during the bubble.
Investing as a venture capitalist is much different than investing as an individual person and investing in cryptocurrency startups is much different than investing in actual bitcoin.

If he doesn't know how to value something he wont buy or sell it, because there is a chance he would be wrong. But he straight up said bitcoin is a mirage.

Bitcoin only has a few million people. Google already has the android operating system and google wallet. Amazon has the largest online marketplace. Bitcoin is still very small, if a big dog was determined to displace it, I think they could. That doesn't mean they want to though. These companies don't want pissed off customers that get hacked for their coins. The majority of people are not ready to use crypto. When the customer protection solutions are in place, then we might see a big dog like google get in.

First part would be correct, yes (assuming my assumption that they are getting their coins from some whales is true). It may also be true that they have private deals with whales to sell when clients want to.
I don't think this would make them become a whale because their account is made up of a bunch of smaller people with no one person in control.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:57:21
You are still assuming 2/3 of bitcoins will be on the market and will be exchanged with USD. Like I said, people are hoarding to protect the value of BTC. ~1000 addresses contain half the BTC. I don't see why that is going to change much in two years. Even the people that are not uber rich in bitcoin are still holding, which keeps much of the rest of the coins off the market.
ETA: Yes, 1000x is retarded, but your math doesn't make sense either. 8 Billion has not been invested in BTC right now even though that is the market cap. Probably $200 million has been invested. That is 40x multiple. So if that stayed the same over 2 years (and I assume the nuts think it will go higher), according to YOUR math, that would be about $30 per person.

The startups can potentially switch to a new coin when it arises. It wont cost coinbase much to add in LTC functionality once it has built the infrastructure for BTC.

He has broad knowledge that is applicable to many investments, that's why he is so successful. Knowing which investments to avoid probably helps a lot too, but even he will admit he is not perfect. Your analogies are not really accurate because if you watch the interview you'll see that he didn't discount the actual bitcoin protocol. In fact, he had positive things to say about it. The protocol may very well turn out to be successful and disruptive, but that doesn't mean buying a BTC is a good long term investment.

Because for them to realize their profit they have to sell. BTC that you cant transfer is worthless.
Maybe if all the whales were colluding they could form a cartel and keep up the price for a long period of time, but they wont all work together forever... It only takes one of them to liquidate and tank the whole thing.
Right now price of BTC is determined by speculators. Maybe..eventually the BTC economy will catch up, but right now price will only go up if more people decide to buy and hold. It is a confidence game, but if you believe in BTC and are in it for the LOONG hall, then you don't care either way.

Plenty of people will sell out if they think the market will crash, risk aversion is human nature too. Bitcoin can be replaced because the number of users is still very small.

The protocol for making transactions can be replicated by anyone and may even be improved. BTC will lose it's low cost transaction advantage as competitors adapt. All BTC has is a network, but that network is tiny compared to banks and large cap companies.
@_date: 2014-03-09 08:32:42
The source code is worth $0, the current computation network is probably worth around $100 million (but could easily be repurposed to more profitable currency if one should arise), there's probably been at most few hundred million worth of other investments in terms of people, time and infrastructure. The user base is a couple million people (how much is a user worth? maybe a hundred dollars each (seems very generous to me at the moment))?).
I'd value the current state of bitcoin as worth around $500 million. So according to my value system 1BTC is valued around $40-50 right now. But obviously part of the price must factor in the future growth in bitcoin value (and the inflationary nature of the fiat system).
The network will grow, the investment will grow, the user base will grow, and the the value per user will grow. I don't see how this is predictable in a reliable way, but all of the people that are invested in bitcoin are working hard to maximize that future value.

You should discuss investments with other smart people you trust, but what I meant was don't don't defer your decisions or reasoning to them. I have no idea how many more people need to use bitcoin for it to match current prices, all I have concluded is that the increase in market cap is do to speculation not increased adoption. However, when the number of bitcoin transactions starts increasing faster than the market cap that will suggest that the speculators may have a smaller driving force.
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:37:38
The "technology economy" isn't really a legitimate counterexample because it is not an entire economy, it's just one sector. The money people spend on technology is still inflating overall even if it is deflating relative to technology.
They key comparison to make is debt based fiat money vs fixed money supply. Delation of a fiat based currency is much worse than deflation with a fixed limit currency. In a fiat currency deflation creates incentives that reduce the money supply (less borrowing, less spending, less investing) this then causes even more deflation which creates a cycle. With a fixed money supply, deflation still creates incentives against borrowing, spending, and investing but this doesn't further reduce money supply so there is no vicious cycle. I'm not sure how bad deflation is when the money supply is fixed, but it is certainly not as bad as with a debt based money.
I don't think this is particularly important to the success of bitcoin. Bitcoin will never be what the world runs. If anything, it will be like an advanced gold.

"Investors are able to transact quickly,  even at scale and without materially moving the market, through a dedicated trading team with a broad set of established, compliant relationships, the majority of which are conducted through direct, private transactions."
So they are helping the whales liquidate with private transactions. Seems like this may not bump the actual rate at the exchanges as much as one would expect. These guys charge like 4% in fees + plus they probably buy the BTC at below market rates from the whales. Sounds like a good money making scheme.

No, not all value is subjective. At least not in monetary terms. The value of $1 is $1. That is not subjective. A profitable company is a money generating machine. How much you can sell that machine to someone else for depends partly on other people's perceptions which will wax and wane, but while you own it, it is stacking up the bills for you and has intrinsic value. Value investing is the paradigm Buffet has used his whole (long) career with enough success to prove that it is superior.

The price of bitcoin is determined by speculators, the actual bitcoin economy is NOT what is driving the price. In fact a very small trading volume determines the price which makes it vulnerable to manipulation. Most users of bitcoin just buy and hold, they don't spend it. 
As far as investing goes, it is not smart to spend your entire investment allocation all at once into something volatile. It's also dangerous to just jump on a bandwagon. You need to research the pros AND the cons of what you buy so you understand both sides. Bitcoin in uncharted territory. No one really understands all the implications of it or if it will work. Don't ask others what you should do. Learn all you can and make the decision you believe in.

The Winklevoss twins, who are probably the most bullish of the sane people, are saying $400 billion (probably a longer horizon than 2 years though). That's another 50x growth.
But the major flaw with OP's math is that it assumes all bitcoins have to be distributed. That's simply not the case now and it wont be in two years. The early adopters are hoarding large amounts of bitcoin and keeping them off the market because selling a significant portion of them would end up reducing the value of their fortune. They need to slowly sell off their supply in a way that matches the increase in adoption in order for it to maintain value.

If the IRS detects you have unreported income they will buttfuck you. They don't care where that unreported income originated from (bitcoin, drugs, legal side business).

They WANT to pay taxes on it because then they can use the banking system and make large purchases with it. Bitcoin is legal so there is no need to do that, but people with significant bitcoin incomes will have to hide that money entirely if they don't want to pay taxes on it.

Volume is much less than it was at 11k and this is also BTC volume, not USD volume, so if you normalized it to USD it would be even lower.

You can check out eric voskuil's work on this issue. The short answer is that the network must spend more money (mining and fees) to fend off the attack.

Brock shill would have a fresh account like the OP and probably say something positive about Brock too.

The earliest use of bcash was the bitfinex announcement about how their tickers and labeling for the fork coin would work. This was only a few days before the fork. The bcashers didnt even try to have a unified ticker (because they didnt want to concede the BTC ticker and admit they were an alt coin). The "real bitcoin/Satoshi's vision" branding had already started and they were pushing segwit FUD hard. You can see much this in Jonald's essay that Ver is reading.
This was a period of time when lots of new people were hearing about and buying bitcoin for the very first time. It made sense for exchanges and ethical people to not feed into potential confusion and it also made sense for Bitcoin investors to not want their brand diluted.

They have a second type of "miner" that publishes their block hashes into the bitcoin blockchain, this allegedly gives them extra security. The miners pay for this tx and get rewarded on their own chain. It's all speculation right now, I imagine if it ever becomes valuable, bitcoin miners would just take all the rewards.

Pretty sketchy for them to do KYC only upon withdrawal. Tell them you are a free lance dev and see what they say. I expect they would unlock the funds.

The billionaires are made during the recovery. You need to already have money so you can buy at the bottom, most people wont have money, which is why they will be selling instead of buying.

A large, devastating reorg can be forked away, sort of like with the overflow bug. More serious is a persistent attack of empty or censored blocks. The only way to fight that is for the network itself to spend more money on mining and fees.
@_date: 2018-10-30 03:55:50
yeah 0.065 has been a historic technical support level for bcash since it was first listed. if it breaks down from that level things could get very interesting. i do think there could be a pump with this upcoming hard fork fud going on...

Obvious troll is obvious. Zero evidence you know brock or have access to any non public information. No content presented but generic speculation. Brock isn't going to get shit and he knows it, but (my guess) he does want the mtgox name and whatever reputational/ego benefits he gets by claiming to be the savior of the creditors who are already practically guaranteed to get their share of the remaining coins.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:28:31
Link? None of the other coins originating from that known address have moved (and there are only 20K more).

Very little though. The vast majority of gold's value is based on social consensus.

Who would trade their bitcoin for oil? Not many. Oil producers just want to sell as much oil as they can. If they want bitcoin, they can use cash to buy it.

Proof of burn improves sybil resistance though because it imposes an extra cost to byzantine behavior. In bitcoin the only cost of an attack is the wasted electricity spent and profits not gained during the attack. In a burn system, there would be an additional cost because they would have the burn credit taken from them and that would have to be repaid before they could start mining again. You could also have a some kind of extra costly initial "work" required to join the network, instead of a burn, to get a similar effect.

People used to use shells as money. Money is an emergent social property. The properties of bitcoin make it good for use as money.
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:16:44
Looks like the consensus participants permissionlessly bond bitcoin in a time lock transaction that can be slashed if the majority decide to slash them. The specific slashing conditions and consensus protocol would be up to the sidechain developer.

He seems to have a personal beef with the core devs.

Conman Craig is a disaster, along with his creepy sugar daddy Calvin Ayre. They are just burning money on BSV ( and have no idea what to do to save themselves so they have decided to go full retard.

One is copying a simple comment of someone you've conversed with for years (and who has a rich history), the other is mid conversation replying from a different account (that was quickly deleted when discovered). Completely different types of "mistakes."

This is very hilarious.

It's such a shitty stablecoin. Coinbase should redeem 1:1 like bitfinex does with tether, instead, they make you trade through illiquid pairs with shitty spreads.
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:21:59
So what is the advantage of using a blockchain then? Just put it on AWS and have much better trading properties at a lower cost.
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:31:07
bitcoin is an illiquid asset

I'm surprised he's not being sued for bch losses, given his misleading marketing campaign.
@_date: 2019-01-11 06:46:55
He's a bullshitter and general weirdo, but I don't think he is "manipulating" people in some underhanded way. He's just not nearly as smart or knowledgable as he presents himself. He's the type of guy that reads a book and thinks he's an expert on the subject.

Upvoted for linking to the source. I generally like chainalysis blogs, happy to read this one.

That's not what tokenized stocks will be.
@_date: 2019-01-20 01:42:53
You don't need blockchain for any of that.
@_date: 2019-01-19 21:42:05
Meh. I don't see the advantage to tokenizing a stock. The market makers may make some money off it, but I dont see how it actually adds any value to the system as a whole. They will still have to comply with all regulations. The only security tokens that I am that interested in are ones that give onchain rights to governance and cashflow.
@_date: 2019-01-20 02:52:03
They are going to be fully regulatory compliant.

Counterproductive to what? I hope people are not taking him seriously.

This guy was defending Theranos not too long ago.
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:17:51
If enough people call him a joke, others will hopefully take him less seriously. Maybe that eventually leads to one less cnbc interview (doubtful). I am not trying to change him.
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:27:05
This guy heavily promoted and defended Theranos.

Have his bcash funds move? He's making money on these forks somehow.

1.8 BTC is not much for some, whales have 100x that amount on exchanges. It takes a long time to get fiat into an exchange, long enough that you can miss out on buying opportunities if you are a trader.

McAfee is the biggest joke of all.
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:00:40
Theranos, which he was an investor in. It was a pretty big scandal because they were selling bad blood tests to the public.

How is it worse than PoW is this regard?
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:15:27
He was also a big pusher behind ETC before the fork, he simply knows he can make bank on these forks. I doubt he will ever stop forking.
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:53:52
He was holding cash, presumably for trading.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:50:04
Here are some guesses:
1) Increase in total fees per block. It's possible higher block size leads to more network usage. It's a supply demand curve, with an optimal (in terms of fees per block) block size that might be higher than what it is now.
2) Decreased reliance on off chain scaling. Off chain scaling may lead to less fees for the miners in the long term, so they want people to have less incentive to move off chain.
3) Low fees may lead to greater adoption. Even if the the total fees goes down, if many more people adopt bitcoin, the value of bitcoin will go up. Miners tend to have substantial holdings so they would benefit from this.
4) Centralization of mining power. For various technical reasons, bigger blocks incentives more centralization of mining. This process would tend to favor incumbents.

If you like trading, bitcoin is probably a good choice given its volatility. That said, most people trading will end up losing money so if you don't actually know how to trade I would say to stay far far away. Bitcoin is also good if you want to put your money in something highly speculative. That means if bitcoins are not part of a greater portfolio that includes a majority of nonspeculative investments, you are just gambling. I personally, wouldn't have more than 5-10% of my savings in speculative assets.

Makes sense if he thinks he can increase his income, meanwhile he's still taking in that patreon cash, unlike Sam harris.
@_date: 2018-12-19 03:19:29
Creating a platform to replace patreon is a great way to generate income.
@_date: 2018-12-18 09:29:35
Rubin is still on patreon, he's not the type to compromise his income. Sam Harris, who has core values, is the one who left patreon even though he had a very large following.
