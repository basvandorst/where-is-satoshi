But it's easy to condone that spending since "if it comes from the Pentagon it must make our nation safer".
With bitcoin there's no way to invest that much that will appeal to the masses. Why would you shit on banks under government control for some virtual currency that "magically prints money".
The reason why bitcoin is so successful is the reason why governments have no problem throwing money at shit until it sticks, it's just a lack of understanding.

I don't hate bcash, in fact at one point i was considering putting a few pennies into it. But since Roger has proved himself to be a monumental douche nozzle only acting on his own best interests, i wouldn't touch bcash with a shitty stick right now.
When you make yourself the front of a product, your actions and attitudes reflect that product. If you're unstable, unpredictable and rather shady, that reputation is reflected upon your product.
I can't help but think this is one of the reasons Satoshi remained anonymous. Without a person to front bitcoin, people are going to look at the creation rather than the creator.

I got 9.45mBTC at £19.50 shortly after the fork when it briefly dipped (because thats all i had to my name), Currently looking at £24.60.
Its got me right into the crypto bug and i'll be buying more next pay day.

Anyone who forms a personal attachment over a project like this throws up big red flags for me (as if Bcash didn't already). Personal attachment leads to personal choice and not what's best for a project.

On the split, s2x is an entirely different coin to BTC and needs to be treated as such. The value for both won't be the same.
Look at bitcoin cash for example. The price of BTC is hitting $7000 but BCH? Thats only at $573.

Nope. The forks are off the bitcoin blockchain and once forked, are then considered different blockchains.
Think of it like a fork in the road. Let's say you fork to the right down road B. If you turn left off of road B, are you also turning off road A? No, because once the fork occured, the roads are independent of each other despite coming from the same road.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:24:34
I'm going by the same attitude as when the fork for BCH happened.
Shortly after the fork, uncertainty drops the price quite a lot, buy in the dip, wait until the knee-jerk reaction sorts itself out.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:32:53
Picture this.
You have a business, and transactions within that business are stored in an excel file. Customers, investments, its all in there.
Your friend, seeing your doing well, wants to create a business just like yours. But instead of building from the ground up, he wants to use your customer base and technology as foundations for his business.
You copy and paste that excel file to him with all your data retained in there. Now he has the technology and foundations in place, he can start logging transactions and building his business.
So now you've got 2 similar businesses operating. Any information logged before you copied and pasted exist in both businesses now. That also includes any investment your customers may have made.

It won't be doubled, but you'll own the same amount of coin either side of the fork.
Take the bitcoin cash fork for example. Lets say you paid $5000 for 1 bitcoin before the fork. After the fork you would own 1 bitcoin and 1 bitcoin cash, but this doesn't mean you've earned another $5000. Why? Because bitcoin cash may not have the same value as bitcoin.
Right now, bitcoin is trading at $5653.77, but bitcoin cash is trading at only $310.92. If you sold your bitcoin and bitcoin cash now (providing somewhere is willing to buy bitcoin cash), you would get $5964.69.

Its the same reason why any cryptocurrency has a value:
-Limited Supply and supply/demand.
-Energy put in in the form of electricity to secure the blockchain.
-Blockchain difficulty level.
-The utility of the currency, and how easy it is to use and store.
-Perceptions on its value by the public.
-Price of Bitcoin.
-Market dilution.
-Confidence in traditional systems.
-Legal/Governmental issues.
And i used the businesses analogy because the bitcoins blockchain is essentially a ledger. It was easier to explain through a medium that we have all become accustomed to.
I would suggest learning what bitcoin is and why it has its value before worrying about the fork. If you know what bitcoin actually is and what gives it its value, you can make smarter investment choices and understand why cryptocurrencies have become so popular. I found the movie "banking on bitcoin" handy to understand the fundamentals of bitcoin and some of its history.
