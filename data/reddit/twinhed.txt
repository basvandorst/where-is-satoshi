Dammit, I wanted to do this like two months ago but never got around to it. Word of advice; advertise on bitcoin gambling sites such as just-dice.com (admin charges something like 1-3 BTC per week), when people win they'll have a way to **instantly** spend their coins for even more pleasure. Take it from me, gambling and sex mixes as well pedophiles and creepy moustaches and brown trench coats. 
This combination will not fail, and I recommend you invest your profits into diversifying your paid porn sites.

I still think that the gambling-paid porn combination will draw significant margins that will make it worth while. I think your problem will be acquiring ad space rights since not every gambling admin will want porn ads on his site, but offering a higher price will take care of this dilemma. 
I think it's going to work very well for you. And when it does you need to be quick to continue building your unique paid porn empire (with a unified brand) through the gambling-sex mix. I can't stress that enough, I am a gambler and I know what it feels like to be up 50% and be on such an emotional high that I browse for instant outlets to blow some profits. That emotional *gambling high* is very similar to the emotion porn provides... just look at Vegas, it's a complete gambling-sex combo.

Really? Would it be possible to reverse a payment from two years ago?
