That’s the train of thought I followed I bought in at 2900 and I’m loving the growth. I have a friend that want to by a massive amount and he asked for my opinion, I told him I would ask you guys and share. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:21:39
What? Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:13:53
The demand is growing every day for bitcoin. If I were you I would make a separate post and ask for more information on how to implement, and pros and cons. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:12:23
I bought in at 2900. I’m no shit asking for a friend that wants to but a substantial amount.

Ya they were very clear not to lose the key I have it stored I a safe place now
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:10:11
Awesome thanks that takes care of the ridiculous fee I was paying and gives me an option for a secure way to buy and store my coins. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:15:27
Yes everyone here has been very patient with me lol

I don't really no what I mean ether lol but you did answer my question. Could I buy the coins through coinbase then transfer them to my wallet where I do own the keys? And if I do that will it eliminate that particular risk? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:33:47
With coinbase do I actually own the coin itself. I don't really understand the concept. (I'm still learning) but I remember in the video that was posted when the split happened the presenter was clear as long as you actually own the coin/coins your in a better position.

I'm using Bitcoin.com wallet app for my wallet seems good so far.
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:30:42
I don't have enough for that yet but hopefully I'll get there 
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:03:36
Will do thanks
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:41:04
Once I get a little bit more I'll look into better storage options. But for now I'm just trying to keep it simple. There is a local meet up for Bitcoin in my town this month hopefully after that I'll be ready to get serious lol. But thanks for the information.

No if you take a look you'll see I mainly just post pictures of my dog to r/aww I am in no way working for or  receiving funds from pebblecoin I'm honestly just looking for knowledge. This is the one that was suggested to me, so that's why I asked about it. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 11:00:46
Awesome information thanks. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:50:39
Part of research is asking others what they know I'm just try to get as much information as I can. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:48:44
Okay first the some guy is someone I know that currently owns Bitcoin and is considering himself on buying pebblecoin. I'm asking this question here because most of the people on here are very smart when it comes to virtual currency. Next your right I don't know anything about this space but I'm trying to learn about it so instead of being a dick you can help or just not say anything. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:16:14
But I guess the real question is it still a good investment? I still plan on buying some bit coin but $1000.00 USD would go a lot further with pebblecoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:31:20
I'm using the Bitcoin app as my wallet 
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:51:29
Awesome I was looking for something like that thanks 
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:36:29
Right now I'm looking at the long term I'm 29 so still awhile till retirement. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 00:07:24
Okay after all the input I got here and a little independent research I have decided not to go with pebble. Thanks to everyone who offered advice.
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:14:38
Yes the opposite of guys. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:29:27
Okay so according to the video I'm good to leave them where they are until it calms down. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:42:40
Idk it seems the answer to that right now is Bitcoin because it's well know and a reliable currency. But when apple launched the iPhone they where the biggest and best now android is. And I'm not trying to say I'll get more coins with a 1000 dollars I'm saying the 1000 looks at face value to have more room to grow. I'm not trying to say bitcoin is inferior or I don't want it to succeed over pebblecoin I'm just trying to find the better opportunity for investment.
