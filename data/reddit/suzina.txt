I believe people making these statements are all HODLers from 2017 and earlier.  During that time, there was a lot of talk of predictions of when, and if, bitcoin would ever go up to 10,000$.  Many predictions that bitcoin would climb up to 10k by January of 2018.  
It is 10k now in January of 2018 so it is funny for them to talk as if it slowly reached this point rather than spiking way up for a few months and then dropping back *down* to 10k.

no, i figured out why I was confused.  I had mined my bitcoin at slushpool years ago, and it stayed there.  But I didn't cash out to my wallet at coinbase until recently.  I thought if the mining was old, and the wallet was old, I'd get any forks.  I'm a moron.  
All I had at slushpool was a *promise* of part of a bitcoin for mining work done, and I didn't cash that promise out for a share of a newly produced coin until after all the forks and stuff because I was not paying attention.  So I was confused, I stand corrected.  Bitcoin cash is a fork, but I was wrong to think I'd have all forks just because I did mining before the forks.

If bitcoin features a super-bowl ad, someone paid millions to drive the price of bitcoin up.... temporarily.  So expect a pump and dump strat if this actually happened.  Be prepared for the dip.

5 years or so ago when bitcoin was only 40$ a coin, my husband and I mined a combined total of 0.10 btc, just like you have.  We stopped because my 500$ graphics card burned out from the mining effort and what we mined was worth less than the cost of the electricity, but the tiny amount of btc stayed there.  And only recently with bitcoin in the news did I find again.
I say, let this .10, this "bit-dime" as I call it, be your lucky dime.  The one that leads to your great success and fortune in the future, just like Scrooge McDuck and his lucky dime in his money bin.   :)

Weiss announces all cryptocurrency gets tripple FFF rating and quickly offers their own pre-mined digital currency to fill the gap.

they have lowered their payment threshhold, but not that low.  I believe you have less than 1$ worth of bitcoin at today's rates there.  Maybe in 20 years you'll find your password again and recover your account and that will actually be a lot?

Slush pool will still have it even if he never cashed out in any way.  Slush pool was what I used back then, and I'm betting he would have been the same.  There were others, but that was the one with the really good reputation for people who researched at the time.
Coinbase was around too.  He could have transferred it to a wallet.  It would automatically do so at the threshold of 1 btc (default back then for payout minimum)

This is why some security company will invent "Bitcôins".  A worthless but very similar looking crypto-currency that the robbers can watch you trade when they ask for your bitcoins.

I have a 5 year old coinbase wallet, but it didn't have any bitcoin in it at the time coinbase gave away free bcash.
Is there some way I can use my old wallet to get free moneys?

I have bitcoin I mined 5 years ago and transferred to coinbase a month after they did their "Free bitcoin cash matching" promotion.  I have no bitcoinCash, and never will.  BitcoinCa$h is Not a fork in Bitcoin, but that scam your grandparents warned you about when you mentioned bitcoin.

A little over 5 years ago I had heard a news report that bitcoin was over 40$ per coin, an all-time high.  I got excited.  I don't think I had even heard of bitcoin before that.  I got real into it.  Real excited.  I taught myself how to mine and joined a pool, burned out a 500$ graphics card and spent whatever a week's worth of running a gaming computer day and night is, but before I stopped mining I got myself a .05 btc off that computer.
Still have that .05 btc and it's in the same wallet.  Didn't begin buying more bitcoin until 2017, but that .05 stayed there all those years going from being worth less than a whopper to more than the gaming computer that mined it.  HODL

If you could mine bitcoins on your home computer while playing a video game still, then you would already be mining bitcoins.

In Washington state, regulations on the state level that effects all crypto-currency designed to protect consumers were ultimately more than most of the exchanges felt like handling.  So they just stopped allowing people in those states to use their services.

Noob to bitcoin buying here.  But I did mine .05 btc 5 years ago.  And I'm holding it!

I just want to say I really trust slushpool from my personal experience.
I mined 5% of a bitcoin 5 years ago until my graphics cards burned out.  I basically left the account abandoned for these years and then came back to it.  There it was.  My payment threashhold was set to 1 bitcoin, a 40$ value at the time, so I never got paid out from slush.  .05 of a bitcoin was mine to transfer out, and I did just a couple weeks ago.
My point being, during those 5 years I never had my account be hacked, or have them change their terms of service to rob abandoned accounts (I see this in some modern services for bitcoin), and from what I remember of the week when I used it back then, they took it very seriously and provided a great service.

These conversations are not so bad if you just put it in laymens terms more.  You could say something like, "It's a currency generated by computers rather than a currency printed by a government that you can use online to buy things.  It goes up in value as more people switch to using it, and may be a very good investment."
Simple.  Don't worry about being accurate with family.  Don't worry about posting the kind of "not quite right" version of things that a redditor would jump on.  Your family will just react with distrust to anything that seems intentionally confusing.
Personally, I gave bitcoin to family this Christmas, and am glad I did.  I wrote on an index card they were each entitled to .001 bitcoin from my wallet, that I would keep for them.  I explained it wasn't worth taking out right now because of the fees, but it is "skyrocket insurance".  If the price doubles, they get to walk around telling people they made double their money on bitcoin.  That kinda thing.
Our christmas was a 20$ limit christmas, is why.

I think this has more to do with legitmacy battles.  Like in the early 2000's, I remember medical MJ dispensories would lose their ability to do credit card purchases all the time, or have to switch banks, all kind of problems.  Sometimes it was just an atm and a cash-only business.
But these days I don't hear of those problems.  MJ sales are a legitimate business and big enough money for even the oligarchs to notice.  10 years from now, people will say, "It's so easy to buy bitcoin with a card now, but it wasn't so easy back when in 2017 when I bought at 18k!"

Me? I say 1/21000000th of all the wealth in the world.  The exact dollar amount of which will vary depending on the inflation and deflation of fiat currency as bitcoin becomes the dominant storage of wealth for the corporations that run the governments.

Been holding my .05 btc for 5 years, and recently doubled it.  The HODL is strong with this one still!
The best time to buy bitcoin is always in the past, but this may be the best available time for a long time!

Congradulations!  1 btc is my goal too.  You get to hear "bitcoin is at" and it's like the news would be announcing your life-savings investment performance without you having to calculate anything. :)

Honestly, if someone would just explain the white paper in a very public way, explaining it terms everyone understood, I think people would be surprised.  There's more to bitcoin than just HOLD and ATH.

Hey, I heard my name?  I want bitcoins.  Gimme gimme gimme.  Give me ALL of your bitcoins.  I wants them.  I don't care the tv says they are worthless and the world government says they are illegal.  Just gives them to me!  As a kid, back in 2018, I saw a cool car with a plate that said, "40 BTC".  Nobody can afford cars anymore, but I want to put that on a holo-tag for my dog, who's a black lab I'm renaming Lambo!
