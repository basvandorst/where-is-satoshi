Things are pretty probabilistic in bitcoin. There is no "guarantee", but the higher the fee you include (as compared to what other transactions have as fees), the more likely it is that miners will want to include it ASAP in the blocks they're mining.


I was too lazy to do this the right way, but from eyeballing u/belcher_'s nice little chart it seems closer to ~50%:
`9 + 8 + 6.5 + 5.5 + 4.7 + 4 + 3.5 + 3 + 2.5 + 2 + 1.4 + 1.2 + 1 =&gt; 52.3`

Did you know there are podcast apps that let you speed up the rate at which the episode is played by up to 3X? Some apps will even cut out a majority of the pauses in audio to further compress the time it takes to absorb the same amount of information. If you'd like recommendations for these types of apps, reply to let me know.
If not, I guess you might not really care much about keeping up with Bitcoin. Which is fine too. But a 3hr podcast episode can easily be turned into a 1hr podcast episode (or shorter) if that were reallly an issue, and if you were actually inclined to address it :)

I'd bet that a lot (if not all) of the people doing the scraping end up not ever seeing your response body, whether they ignore anything with a 40* status, or because they are only parsing certain specific elements of the pages that they're retrieving. A way to test both of those hypotheses might be to still respond with a 200, and/or serve up exactly similarly-structured HTML as they expect, with the actual content they might be trying to scrape replaced with instructions for bitcoin payment in every element they might be interested in?

Chill out yo. Infrastructure takes time
@_date: 2015-12-30 02:37:50
There’s a [single line of code]( in Bitcoin Core that says the maximum block size is 1,000,000 bytes (1MB). The simplest change would be a hard fork to update that line to say, for example, 2,000,000 bytes (2MB).
***Hard forks are anything but simple***:
- **We don’t have experience:** Miners, merchants, developers, and users have never deployed a hard fork, so techniques for safely deploying them have not been tested. This is unlike soft forks, whose deployments were initially managed by Nakamoto, where we gained experience from the complications in the [BIP16]( deployment, where we refined our technique in the [BIP34]( deployment, and where we’ve gained enough experience with BIPs [66]( and [65]( to begin managing multiple soft forks with [BIP9]( version bits in the future.
- **Upgrades required:** Hard forks require all full nodes to upgrade or everyone who uses that node may lose money. This includes the node operator, if they use it to protect their wallet, as well as lightweight clients who get their data from the node.
- **Other changes required:** Even a single-line change such as increasing the maximum block size has effects on other parts of the code, some of which are undesirable. For example, right now it’s possible to construct a transaction that takes up almost 1MB of space and which takes 30 seconds or more to validate on a modern computer (blocks containing such transactions have been mined). In 2MB blocks, a 2MB transaction can be constructed that may take over 10 minutes to validate which opens up dangerous denial-of-service attack vectors. Other lines of code would need to be changed to prevent these problems.
Despite these considerable complications, with sufficient precautions, none of them is fatal to a hard fork, and we do expect to make hard forks in the future. But with segregated witness (segwit) we have a soft fork, similar to other soft forks we’ve performed and gained experience in deploying, that provides us with many benefits in addition to allowing more transactions to be added to the blockchain.
Segwit does require more changes in higher level software stacks than a simple block size increase, but if we truly want to see bitcoin scale, far more invasive changes will be needed anyway, and segwit will gently encourage people to upgrade to more scalable models right away without forcing them to do so.
Developers, miners, and the community have accrued significant experience deploying soft forks, and we believe segwit can be deployed at least as fast, and probably more securely, than a hard fork that increases the maximum block size.

Except that network effects likely run much deeper and are far more entrenched with all the infrastructure required for a cryptocurrency (miners, software, services, retailers, etc) than with a social network. 
The switching costs for cryptocurrency are arguably orders of magnitude higher than the switching costs of someone deciding to jump ship to a new social network.

Agreed that it's suboptimal to have all nodes on one hosting provider.

Ideally it'd be awesome to have a service where companies and/or individuals can directly contribute btc in order to spin up more full nodes. If this doesn't already exist, it's sorta crazy to me, because it would actually be quite straightforward to set this up: would just need a simple web interface that accepts btc, and Docker + [Terraform]( on the backend would automate all the deployments...

Because some of the largest businesses (Coinbase, Bitpay, Blockchain.info, etc) responsible for the most transactions have been dragging their feet and not adopting segwit. Why you may ask? Well, it’s easier to do nothing than it is to do something... these are the same businesses that were pushing for a block size increase, because that literally would have required the least amount of effort from them. 
Also, I think that the potential adoption of Lightning Network probably scares the fuck out of them because it may completely up-end some of their business models if they don’t properly adapt to it...

The main argument against a deflationary currency is the "sticky wages" issue. Do some research on why mainstream economists have seemingly thought that's important. You'll likely come to the conclusion that denominating salaries/mortgages/etc in dynamically (*programmable*) fluctuating value according to the price of bitcoin and size of the economy will be trivial with smart contracts. Ergo, sticky wages and deflation won't be bad at all, because it will be easy to adjust prices **down** instead of constantly pushing them **up**.

Because it's actually a pretty simple process, which if you understood would mean you shouldn't be asking this question. Not trying to be harsh, just trying to understand what you don't get, and why.

Working with distributed databases/syncing tech is what made me finally pay attention to bitcoin when the Cyprus stuff hit the fan during the $266 bubble.
For some reason I hadn't thought a government would really have the gall to literally steal money from people, but then I started to dig into history and econ and realized how incredibly naive I'd been. However, bitcoin tech seemed like it had the potential to be a global antidote to the massive failures of the existing financial system, and I haven't looked back since.

While is clearly just trying to do his job as best he can (props to that), the proposed BitLicense regs just show how arbitrary, inefficient, and ineffective the existing system of government-enforced regulations is (and will continue to be).
What I read seems like it will likely have a crippling effect on ~~virtual~~ **digital** currency innovation in NY.
A "BitLicense" would have been actually useful to citizens served by it if it'd been structured as a *stamp-of-approval* of good bitcoin exchange business practices, not as a *follow-these-rules-or-else* edict from up above.
Bitcoin innovation will easily re-route elsewhere though, so it's not really that big of a deal.

For only 10 BTC, go with Coinbase. Everything else will just be a headache in comparison.
For over 10 BTC, BitStamp would make more sense as you'd be able to avoid buy limits.
I'd say now is indeed a great time to buy, but honestly you're sorta a moron if you decide to make an investment like this on blind faith based on random internet commentary.

I was afraid of the potential "penalties" as well, but when I did the math to see if it made sense or not, I took the conservative route of assuming that BTC would only double within a year, which would actually still net me more than what my 401k was giving me, penalties and all.

Congrats! WWDC is great, if there's one piece of advice I'd give though it'd be to focus on meeting/talking to people while there (the developers there are generally very friendly and happy to talk about whatever). The sessions are cool and all, but remember that they'll be videotaped and available to watch whenever. So to make the most of it, think of what kinds of questions/advice/suggestions you might be able to get from others at WWDC (you never know if a simple conversation might lead to some awesome opportunities down the line!)
Also, if there's a way to connect with the others who got a scholarship beforehand, definitely do that (I'd recommend getting together for dinner/lunch early on in the conference, if something like that hasn't already been arranged, see if maybe you can arrange it yourself!)

I'm not surprised that Apple gave you such a hard time if you were trying to initiate bitcoin donations through the app. I'd be curious to hear how had you implemented that btw?

The only real risk I see to bitcoin is if there is any serious flaw/weakness in the protocol. As such, I'm personally taking a deep dive into crypto in order to properly assess (and potentially even help mitigate) that risk.
As far as I'm concerned, all the econ/biz/people "risks" that get thrown around are either totally off base, or easily solvable.

If that were to potentially completely destroy the original intent of Bitcoin, which we agreed was to keep it decentralized in order to have true economic freedom, would you really be willing to throw that promise away just to satisfy "the community"?

**Incorrect.** Bankers and governments would want that world.
@_date: 2016-01-19 21:30:35


This is super simple:
***IF BITCOIN DIES, BLOCKSTREAM DIES*** 
[People on the Blockstream team have time-locked bitcoin]( that gives them a pretty good incentive to massively improve Bitcoin, *NOT* to slow or stifle it. 
The [sidechains tech that Blockstream is working on is open source]( (as is their [LN implementation]( though [the Lightning Network was actually proposed by a completely different and independent team]( who [also have open sourced their tech]( so if your conspiracy theory is predicated on Blockstream being self-serving and trying to undermine Bitcoin only for their own gain, then you've been sadly misinformed.
*"How will Blockstream make money if all their stuff is open source"* you may ask? 
Well, maybe with something like [Liquid: a system that uses sidechains to provide better liquidity to cryptocurrency exchanges]( 


Yeah, no shit, Blockstream's existence happens to be a great way to enable some of the developers who were amongst the first to help Satoshi build Bitcoin into what it is today (and kept working on it long after Satoshi left) by paying their salaries... *are you proposing developers somehow spend all their time maintaining and improving Bitcoin's code without any source of income?* How exactly would that work? 
***STOP WITH THE FUD***
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:41:34
Unless you're suggesting they'd turn off the internet forever, this would be temporary (and a temporary network outage wouldn't kill bitcoin). 
Also though, generally speaking if a government were to really try to "turn off the internet" worldwide, there'd likely be huge damages caused to normal economies... not sure it'd ever make sense to do.

**FUD.** This is the same thing that Mike Hearn (who is now working for your beloved banksters) was saying months ago in a failed attempt to push for the BitcoinXT contentious hard fork.


The "community" consists of countless sockpuppet accounts (luckily now seemingly somewhat contained in r/btc), and the few people who have *not* opted out of the conversations because they have been so (generally) lowbrow. 
Let's be realistic here—the ***"community"*** has lately really likely been a bunch of: 
* government agents 
* legacy financial industry stooges
* altcoiners trying to pump &amp; dump
Great community huh?

TL;DR version:
* Soft forks *add* new rules to the protocol, making previously *valid* blocks *invalid*.
* Hard forks *remove* rules from the protocol, making previous *invalid* blocks *valid*.
For example: increasing 21M max coin count would be a hard fork.

@_date: 2016-01-17 01:29:14
u/nullc TBH the roadmap is sorta hard to find on bitcoin.org (though I know Core has limited control of how/where things are displayed on the site). 
Many people seem to be woefully unaware of the roadmap... not that it's right, but a lot of the misinformation/attacks could probably be prevented with better messaging/marketing (though obviously allocating resources to that means potentially not allocating resources to doing the actual important work). =\

What makes them "very suspect" to you? 
Let me guess, is your theory that they could be trying to cripple Bitcoin proper in order to "force" people to switch over to sidechains and/or LN (which are open source) and extract high fees from them? Because, if the logical flaw in that thinking isn't immediately obvious, let me make it abundantly clear: *that theory completely crumbles given the fact that* ***both sidechains/LN tech are open source and therefore usable by ANYONE***—*not just Blockstream*. If they were to set up artificially high fees for using any of this stuff, any other competitor could easily come in and undercut them.
So, is it still "very easy to picture them as the enemy" to you?

It's not that bizarre when you consider the fact that so many people apparently think Bitcoin is about "democracy". In a democracy a politician's job has devolved into appealing to as many people as possible, regardless of the facts, their abilities, or their actual underlying intentions—and then you come to the sad realization that Bitcoin has become completely infected by politics, and Bitcoin-politicians.

If your next reply here doesn't include a link to the "Bitcoin Foundation minutes" that you cited as evidence of Blockstream having some sort of evil business model (or you don't respond at all), I guess that I (and everyone else who may see this) will be left no option but to come to the conclusion that you, u/Anen-o-me, are an outright liar—actively and maliciously spreading misinformation—right? :)

There are cheap and fast ways to transact money that have been available before Bitcoin... so I'm not sure that's an accurate assessment of what "Satoshi's vision" was.
If Bitcoin/Satoshi is supposed to stand for anything, a **trust-minimizing, censorship-and-tamper resistant system** is what I'd say it really comes down to. 
Ask yourself who's really fighting for that cause? Or is it not worth fighting for?
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:16:40


Glad that we agree that censorship resistance is a top priority :) 
However, wouldn't you say that a large part of censorship resistance is the ability for as many people as possible to be able to run a full bitcoin node? 
Can you think of *anything else* that can guarantee censorship-and-tamper resistance, other than trying to ensure that the number of fully validating bitcoin nodes grows, instead of shrinks? Because I can't. Ideally, everyone in the world would be able to verify the ledger, on the flipside, we could all just trust one central "node of truth". Which side of that spectrum should be aimed for?

Without censorship resistance, the commercial value of bitcoin is meaningless, as it will no longer serve its original/intended purpose. 
**Thought experiment:** if Google/Apple/Facebook/Amazon formed a consortium that cloned Bitcoin, switched proof-of-work algo, and set their data center prowess to work to secure and scale this to the same level (and beyond) of Bitcoin overnight, it'd theoretically be MUCH more efficient, easier to use, widely accepted, disruptive to the existing payment networks, etc. One could even argue it's decentralized because each company is in fierce competition with the others to mint more coins and secure more value for themselves. If better/faster payment technology is all we want, this would be a great solution, no?

No, I don't see that there is a conflict of interest. 
What exactly would "incentivize them to work against bitcoin"? Blockstream's sidechain tech is all open source. Is your theory that they would be trying to cripple Bitcoin proper in order to switch people over to sidechains in order to extract money from them that way? Because, if it's not obvious, that theory completely crumbles given the fact that **sidechains tech is all open source and usable by ANYONE... not just Blockstream**. If they were to set up artificially high fees for using pegged sidechains, any other competitor could come in and undercut them.

In my opinion, this whole "debate" isn't really about technical solutions to scaling Bitcoin. It's about ideals.
What's the core, guiding principle and philosophy behind Bitcoin? What *IS* Bitcoin supposed to even be?
u/BobAlison points out a potential fundamental aspect of Bitcoin:


I'd take it a step further to try to fully encapsulate this ethos—I'd say that the "job to be done" that we hire Bitcoin for is the following:
**Trust-minimizing, censorship-and-tamper resistant information exchange.**
In other words, *freedom of information.*
The way I see it, the philosophies of the two sides of the debate would manifest into either one of these two end states:
* 1) a truly free (as in freedom) system that can be scaled and still remain free, even though it could slow "immediate wide adoption"
* 2) a system that is successfully scaled in order to accommodate immediate wide adoption, but in the process, has some core properties that previously made it free (potentially) degraded, and *therefore* ***may not remain free*** *(as in freedom)*
If I had to pick, I'd chose option 1) over option 2) ...it seems like the obvious choice **IF** you care about Bitcoin being a *trust-minimizing, censorship-and-tamper resistant information exchange* system.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:34:35

Reid Hoffman (i.e. the guy who founded LinkedIn) is one of Blockstream's investors—and I think he'd probably beg to differ:
[''[...] the blockchain, and the kinds of transactions it enables, is a foundational addition to the Internet that has the potential to massively expand the ways we interact with each other. [...] What’s even more remarkable about Bitcoin and the trustless trust architecture it introduces is that it’s open source, a technology that no one company controls to its advantage, a public good. This characteristic is foundational to Bitcoin’s value and success to date. [...] And that’s why I’m participating in this first-round financing as an individual investor, and why Blockstream itself will function similarly to the Mozilla Corporation. Here, our first interest is maintaining and enhancing Bitcoin’s strong open ecosystem. And the structure we’ve chosen will give us the freedom and flexibility to prioritize public good over returns to investors."](

You're correct that for (educated) users, exchanging one cryptocurrency for another may be pretty painless. 
But what I think you might be missing is the enormous switching cost for other players in the ecosystem. Think of the massive amount of infrastructure that bitcoin has in place: from the huge investment of time and brainpower of some of the best engineers and developers in the space, to the mindshare of the most popular fiat on-ramps/off-ramps, to convenient/safe wallets, hard-won merchant acceptance, the amount of bitcoin-focused startups, and enormous sums spent on bitcoin-specific hardware, datacenters, and power for mining... all of that is not as simple to switch from one cryptocurrency to another I'd say :)

At u/andyrowe—I seriously appreciate you taking the time to actually answer my question. Thanks, it's been insightful :)


100% agreed, and it's extremely unfortunate. While perhaps an oversimplification, I think many would agree that engineers in general are kinda-not-great at communicating with non-highly-technical people. That's okay, because we can't expect everyone to be good at everything. But, IMO, Core could really use a marketing/PR person/team... *badly*.


The political attacks have sucked, for sure. Ad hominem and personal attacks are overall pretty uncool. I've been around all sorts of forums for a good while now though, and let's just say that the amounts of insanely flagrant misinformation and propagandization that's been happening on "our" forums has been impressively intense, to put it lightly. We must try to remember who the ***real*** potential adversaries are... 
Would it be safe to say that we, as Bitcoiners, should all start trying to figure out how to **avoid** this kind of thing in the future? 
This kind of complete breakdown in communications resulting in total misunderstandings could certainly be preventable, no?

Reid Hoffman (i.e. the guy who founded LinkedIn) is one of Blockstream's investors—this is what he had to say about his vision and intention with his investment in their company:
[''[...] the blockchain, and the kinds of transactions it enables, is a foundational addition to the Internet that has the potential to massively expand the ways we interact with each other. [...] What’s even more remarkable about Bitcoin and the trustless trust architecture it introduces is that it’s open source, a technology that no one company controls to its advantage, a public good. This characteristic is foundational to Bitcoin’s value and success to date. [...] And that’s why I’m participating in this first-round financing as an individual investor, and why Blockstream itself will function similarly to the Mozilla Corporation. Here, our first interest is maintaining and enhancing Bitcoin’s strong open ecosystem. And the structure we’ve chosen will give us the freedom and flexibility to prioritize public good over returns to investors."](

Where exactly are you getting that number from? Because the estimates of Satoshi's holdings I've seen are more along the lines of 1-1.5M bitcoin, which would be at most ~10% of current existing bitcoin, but less than half that when all 21M have been mined.

I'd say that "*advanced, persistent [...] threats*", aka APTs, are faced by any subject worthy of being considered a worthwhile prey by some predator. Technically speaking, we should be happy that bitcoin is/has been under attack... at the very least it means someone/something thinks Bitcoin is worth attacking, **which must mean something**, right? ;)
RE: APTs, how about we *zoom out* on a few ideas, and then *zoom back in*:
* One-celled organisms develop cell walls and various protective protein complexes as defensive mechanisms against external agonists
* Multi-cellular systems (all the way up to us—humans) are able to coordinate at an organism-wide level and develop more sophisticated, immediately reactive, but also long-term (i.e. in a compsci analogy, not just in-memory, but on-disk) immune responses to threats
* Governments develop armies, and laws... to... errr, enact 'justice'?
* Bitcoin, um... uhhh, wtf—Bitcoin is decentralized bro, no‽‽‽
Even though Reddit totally sucks as a platform for deflecting attacks against Bitcoin, attacks have indeed been successfully defended against so far. 
I have a feeling the attacks will continue evolving rapidly though, and so the defenders will need to similarly evolve to keep up. Aka, prepare for a classical "cat and mouse" situation—a never-ending whack-a-mole game.

Since I went "all-in" on bitcoin in 2013, my strategy has been to only cash out as much money as I'll need for a month's worth of non-bitcoin-payable expenses (such as rent) in fiat/USD, the rest I have kept as bitcoin and spend as bitcoin (either directly, or through things like the Shift or Bitpay cards). I don't have to care about price fluctuations because I always know that even if bitcoin goes to zero, I'm at least okay for the next month. 
So, I both hold bitcoin long term **and** use it as a currency, and I don't think the volatility has really impeded me in using it or spending my money however I want (other than the fact that I sort of hate spending any at all, knowing that the price could go up much higher...)

That's funny, here I am looking at prices of things that I can buy online with bitcoin, and the fact that the value of a bitcoin fluctuates doesn't matter to me one bit :)
I'd argue that "volatility" in a currency like bitcoin isn't necessarily a negative thing. If you were running a supermarket and had to update physical price stickers with every fluctuation in the currency (as has been the case in countries that have undergone hyperinflation, such as Argentina, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, etc) I'd agree that currency volatility is bad. But as far as I've seen, things that are sold for bitcoin don't generally have physical price labels on them, and instead are generally sold online (or tied into internet-connected Point-Of-Sale systems).
***tl;dr:*** volatility does **not** kill the currency aspect of bitcoin in any meaningful way.

The fact that the huge sell offs on every newly confirmed Bcash block were so predictable in the first few days because everyone was waiting for confirmations on their BCH deposits (and the fact that prices seemed to generally rise the longer it took to discover new blocks) made it somewhat alluring to play a “block arbitrage” game. That is, I could see how traders might buy up “cheap” BCH on every post-confirmed-block BCH price dump, and then try to time the selling of these *before* the next block was found, while the price had increased again. Basically just becomes a game of musical chairs.

@_date: 2017-08-09 01:16:24


Short answer: [You can do it [without SegWit], but it's fugly.](
Also, the SegWit upgrade has already been locked-in (as of today), and did *not* require a hard fork (only a "soft fork", basically meaning that it's a backwards compatible, opt-in update to the protocol, whereas with a "hard fork" **everyone** would be forced to upgrade their software in order to accept (potentially arbitrarily expansive/bad) new rules, or otherwise risk perhaps not being able to access/use their bitcoin as they previously could).

LN is not a fork of bitcoin, but yeah, "add-on" would be more correct. LN is a "layer 2" protocol built to ride on top of layer 1 (the bitcoin blockchain) which makes use of smart contracts and real bitcoin transactions to massively improve the speed and scale of bitcoin.
Imagine TCP/IP as layer 1, and HTTP over TCP/IP as layer 2. Likewise, Bitcoin is layer 1 in this analogy, and Lightning Network is layer 2.

Thanks for taking the time to answer still, appreciate the discussion :)
I guess I'm sorta interpreting your points as a "slippery slope" kind of argument? I'm aware of how decoupling occurred with fiat, but I'd push back and say that with the abstractions that were used in those cases (and the cumbersome nature of dealing with precious metals), it was *much* harder to audit that things were all above board, and thus much easier to pull the wool over people's eyes.
I'd counter that the ease of auditing bitcoin/LN (hell, blockchains are fully public databases/transaction logs) means that it'd be practically impossible to sneak value in/out without people noticing. But then again, I'm a programmer and could verify these things for myself.. whereas many people might not think that they could do so as well...
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:22:11

You’ve got that completely reversed. ETH is inferior to BTC in nearly every way (except that ETH seems to have much more [undeserved] hype). 
The (supposed) main selling point of ETH is their “smart contracts”, and that seems to entice n00bs. However, [bitcoin can also do smart contracts]( but [arguably does them much smarter, with a purposefully non-Turing Complete scripting/programming language]( which basically rules out lots of potential bugs and attack vectors that seem to occur quite often with ETH.

@_date: 2017-11-16 03:25:40


Heh, wrong :)
LN has nothing at all to do with side chains, they’re two different protocols with very different goals. The ELI5 is that side chains are basically a way to more safely experiment with new/different potential features for bitcoin, off to the side (but still “anchoring”, or pegging things to the real bitcoin blockchain). Kind of like a more-realistic testnet (with real value at stake) is the simplest explanation I can think of. For example, the Rootstock team is basically going to try attaching the entire Ethereum EVM as a sidechain on bitcoin, with the idea of giving bitcoin all the smart contract “capabilities” (lulz?) of Ethereum.
LN is a completely different animal which can be explained as simply a caching layer for bitcoin, specifically meant to scale transaction speed and throughput without trusted intermediaries. For more thorough explanations of Lightning, I’d highly suggest checking out some of the stuff here: 
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:15:26


One of the reasons why some of the miners were so anti-SegWit (and probably also terrified of LN)
You’d think that they might have a long term view on the matter, that scaling with this tech will more than likely help increase adoption, and the price... not sure why some of these miners have been so incredibly short-sighted (unless covert ASICboost or something similar is so insanely profitable for them?)
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:58:45


No. There are no trusted intermediaries in LN.


Incorrect. The sender of funds can route their payment however they see fit, there doesn’t have to be any agreement on that.


No... and, no offense, but you asking this makes it seem as if you don’t actually know how LN works beyond a pretty superficial and inaccurate understanding. 
Have you read the LN paper? Seen the many talks available on YouTube about it that the devs have given? I’d suggest doing so if you’re actually interested in this stuff. Here’s a great starting point:

@_date: 2017-11-04 16:46:01






Not sure if you work in software engineering, but in the industry there’s this idea called ‘trade-offs’.
If running a full node becomes infeasible for “normal” folks due to increased hardware and/or bandwidth requirements with a hypothetical block size increase, then in that situation more folks would be outsourcing their auditing of the blockchain to third parties, since they couldn’t do it themselves. This lowers their security for any large bitcoin payments they may do.
The Lightning Network is specifically meant to offload transactions (e.g. buying coffee) that ***don’t*** need to be stored in the blockchain for all of time, in order to keep auditability of larger/important transactions feasible. The trade-off here is that, yes, monitoring for bad actors in LN is necessary, but again, you don’t have to actually TRUST any specific person, and can easily monitor for this yourself if you’d like. AND this results in a non-bloated blockchain that more people can still audit themselves.

Normal Bitcoin transactions are currently theoretically potentially censorable (e.g. if you had all miners decide to blacklist any transactions from some special address). That’s unlikely, however, since some new miners could come online and decide to include that transaction in a block.
In LN, the theoretical censoring situation is (IMO) even more ridiculously unlikely than it is with normal Bitcoin transactions. With onion-routing and the ease of running LN nodes (i.e. it’s ***way*** easier than attempting to mine bitcoin), the chance of transactions being censored on LN are practically nonexistent...

    BIP: ??
    Title: Block size following technological growth
    Author: Pieter Wuille &lt;pieter.wuille
    Status: Draft
    Type: Standards Track
    Created: 2015-07-21
This BIP proposes a block size growth intended to accommodate for hardware and other technological improvements for the foreseeable future.
Many people want to see Bitcoin scale over time, allowing an increasing number of transactions on the block chain. It would come at an increased cost for the ecosystem (bandwidth, processing, and storage for relay nodes, as well as an impact on propagation speed of blocks on the network), but technology also improves over time. When all technologies depended on have improved as well as their availability on the market, there is no reason why Bitcoin's fundamental transaction rate cannot improve proportionally.
Currently, there is a consensus rule in place that limits the size of blocks to 1000000 bytes. Changing this requires a hard-forking change: one that will require every full node in the network to implement the new rules. The new chain created by those changed nodes will be rejected by old nodes, so this would effectively be a request to the ecosystem to migrate to a new and incompatible network. Doing this while controversy exists is dangerous to the network and the ecosystem.
Furthermore, the effective space available is always constrained by a hash rate majority and its ability to process transactions. No hard forking change that relaxes the block size limit can be guaranteed to provide enough space for every possible demand - or even any particular demand - unless strong centralization of the mining ecosystem is expected. Because of that, the development of a fee market and the evolution towards an ecosystem that is able to cope with block space competition should be considered healthy. This does not mean the block size or its limitation needs to be constant forever. However, the purpose of such a change should be evolution with technological growth, and not kicking the can down the road because of a fear of change in economics.
Bitcoin's advantage over other systems does not lie in scalability. Well-designed centralized systems can trivially compete with Bitcoin's on-chain transactions in terms of cost, speed, reliability, convenience, and scale. Its power lies in transparency, lack of need for trust in network peers, miners, and those who influence or control the system. Wanting to increase the scale of the system is in conflict with all of those. Attempting to buy time with a fast increase is not wanting to face that reality, and treating the system as something whose scale trumps all other concerns. A long term scalability plan should aim on decreasing the need for trust required in off-chain systems, rather than increasing the need for trust in Bitcoin.
In summary, hard forks are extremely powerful, and we need to use them very responsibly as a community. They have the ability to fundamentally change the technology or economics of the system, and can be used to disadvantage those who expected certain rules to be immutable. They should be restricted to uncontroversial changes, or risk eroding the expectation of low trust needed in the system in the longer term. As the block size debate has been controversial so far - for good or bad reasons - this BIP aims for gradual change and its effects start far enough in the future.
The block size limitation is replaced by the function below, applied to the median of the timestamps of the previous 11 blocks, or in code terms: the block size limit for pindexBlock is GetMaxBlockSize(pindexBlock-&gt;pprev-&gt;GetMedianTimePast()).
The sigop limit scales proportionally.
It implements a series of block size steps, one every ~97 days, between January 2017 and July 2063, each increasing the maximum block size by 4.4%. This allows an overall growth of 17.7% per year.
    uint32_t GetMaxBlockSize(int64_t nMedianTimePast) {
        // The first step is on januari 1st 2017.
        if (nMedianTimePast &lt; 1483246800) {
            return 1000000;
        }
        // After that, one step happens every 2^23 seconds.
        int64_t step = (nMedianTimePast - 1483246800) &gt;&gt; 23;
        // Don't do more than 11 doublings for now.
        step = std::min&lt;int64_t&gt;(step, 175);
        // Every step is a 2^(1/16) factor.
        static const uint32_t bases[16] = {
            // bases[i] ** round(1000000 * pow(2.0, (i + 1) / 16.0))
            1044274, 1090508, 1138789, 1189207,
            1241858, 1296840, 1354256, 1414214,
            1476826, 1542211, 1610490, 1681793,
            1756252, 1834008, 1915207, 2000000
        };
        return bases[step &amp; 15] &lt;&lt; (step / 16);
    }
Waiting 1.5 years before the hard fork takes place should provide ample time to minimize the risk of a hard fork, if found uncontroversial.
Because every increase (including the first) is only 4.4%, risk from large market or technological changes is minimized.
The growth rate of 17.7% growth per year is consistent with the average growth rate of bandwidth the last years, which seems to be the bottleneck. If over time, this growth factor is beyond what the actual technology offers, the intention should be to soft fork a tighter limit.
Using a time-based check is very simple to implement, needs little context, is efficient, and is trivially reviewable. Using the "median time past" guarantees monotonic behaviour, as this median is required to be increasing, according to Bitcoin's existing consensus rules. Using the "median time past" of the block before means we know in advance what the limit of each block will be, without depending on the actual block's timestamp.
This is a hard forking change, thus breaks compatbility with old fully-validating node. It should not be deployed without widespread consensus.
Thanks to Gregory Maxwell and Wladimir J. van der Laan for their suggestions.

Actually, we can do ***way*** better than doubling Bitcoin's effective TPS every year or two :)
Imagine how great it would be to have the ability to perform **practically instant,** ***infinite,*** **100% real Bitcoin transactions**. Well, the [Lightning Network]( is being worked on by quite a few people as we speak to bring that vision to fruition. 
For those not already aware, the Lightning Network (LN) is a completely open source, decentralized, P2P network/protocol that can be thought of as a ["write-cache layer"]( for Bitcoin that does not rely on any trusted intermediaries. When it comes to addressing Bitcoin's current TPS limitations, LN seems poised to become *kinda-a-big-deal* that might be worth learning about...

Heh. I'm sure plenty of pro-"Classic" people would call that argument a [strawman]( however ;)
In terms of the Mission Statement arguments they're giving for supporting "Classic" in [their own thread]( so far I've seen:
* It's a vote for decentralization of control of bitcoin software.
* Core developers, while very respected, are not an absolute authority.
* The Mission Statement is basically the implementation of the Satoshi white paper
* The Core Devs say a lot of things, and end up doing something else. All of their actions are steering bitcoin into a settlement layer in which they stated $20 transactions fee's would be fine. Their solutions are far more dangerous than a planned hard fork with a trigger and 28 day grace period.
What I haven't seen them mention in their thread yet though, is that for a long while "Classic's" focus seemed to also be on changing the governance structure of Bitcoin to become more 'democratic'. That's why  exists. 
Bitcoin's future governance structure is what [Mr. Toomim specifically talks about in his interview on how "Classic" wants to change how decisions are made in Bitcoin's code]( I guess what I'm wondering is, would those previously stated principles by the main people behind Bitcoin "Classic" be part of their mission statement, or not? Because those principles certainly seemed to be used to attract followers...

It's not surprising that miners in China are considering "Classic" when you realize that [apparently people have been translating Gavin's blog posts into Chinese]( and I'm not sure that much (if anything) from Core has been translated. 
For example, it'd be great if the [Rocketship to the Moon vs Clown Car]( post was translated, or [Mr. Toomim's interview on how "Classic" wants to handle Bitcoin governance]( if miners actually saw this stuff I think they'd pretty quickly come to their senses.

Paging u/nullc and u/adam3us — I think that 'Core' taking some sort of strong philosophical stance would be important to emphasize (and strongly delineate) the differentiation from "Classic's" goals. I *personally* understand that the cypherpunk ethos may not exactly be the most generally commercially appeasing stance to take publicly, but, at this point, I think that not standing by it strongly will only hurt, not help. Just my 2 satoshis..

While I'm definitely not a fan of the approach that Roger has taken, it'd be inaccurate to say that "he has nothing at risk". It *does* cost him to attack the network—not just monetary costs, but social and reputational costs too (e.g. who gives a shit what Gavin Andresen has to say about Bitcoin anymore?)
@_date: 2016-02-02 14:33:34


The only *real* way to "shun the spotlight" would be the same way Satoshi Nakamoto did. 
I think a large part of the current problem with the Core vs. "Classic" situation is that *lots* of people know both Gavin and Garzik's names and faces.. and *very few* people have any clue who the rest of the contributors have been (much less the magnitude of their contributions)...

Reid Hoffman (i.e. the guy who founded LinkedIn) is one of Blockstream's investors—this is what he had to say about his vision and intention with his investment in Blockstream:
[''[...] the blockchain, and the kinds of transactions it enables, is a foundational addition to the Internet that has the potential to massively expand the ways we interact with each other. [...] What’s even more remarkable about Bitcoin and the trustless trust architecture it introduces is that it’s open source, a technology that no one company controls to its advantage, a public good. This characteristic is foundational to Bitcoin’s value and success to date. [...] And that’s why I’m participating in this first-round financing as an individual investor, and why Blockstream itself will function similarly to the Mozilla Corporation. Here, **our first interest is maintaining and enhancing Bitcoin’s strong open ecosystem. And the structure we’ve chosen will give us the freedom and flexibility to prioritize public good over returns to investors.**"](

Personally, I have an academic/medical background, and the [Hippocratic Oath]( was kind of a big deal for those of us who wanted to become doctors.

Here is the original Hippocratic Oath, for others to perhaps run with and maybe (hopefully?) adapt to what makes Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies special:


I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.
I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures which are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.

Um, lightning network nodes do not act as custodians of funds (trustless, time-locked multisig "smart contracts" is how things work under the hood). 
This means a LN operator ***cannot*** steal your funds (unlike current-day bitcoin exchanges, for example). 
I am not a lawyer, but I'd imagine that massively minimizes the need/chance of LN requiring arbitrary human regulatory oversight.
@_date: 2016-09-20 00:14:19


Properly running LN nodes will quickly become a very professional, very big business IMO. Latency, uptime, capacity to handle txs, fees, etc will be how different LN providers compete in the market place.

Based on  hashrate data:
* F2Pool — 29%
* BitFury — 17%
* BTCC Pool — 14%
* BW — 8%
*29 + 17 + 14 + 8 =* ***68%*** hashing power is *against* the Bitcoin "Classic" contentious hard fork.
Unless my math is wrong, considering "Classic" needed 75% and is now seemingly left with 32% (at most) of hashing rate support, this pretty much means it's dead in the water, right?

I think you might be a bit misguided here. If the current group of core devs leave, then I’m pretty sure a lot of the other smartest/longtime bitcoiners (who actually care about Bitcoin’s cypherpunk ethos) will leave as well. Myself included.
It’s a matter of what the philosophy and standards of those who’ve built Bitcoin so far uphold... if you think any 2 bit idiot(s) can/should be able to replace the current devs, well, it’d seem as if you haven’t thought about the potential disastrous consequences too deeply.

Some people seem to hear “blockchain technology” and then think it can solve all the world’s problems. In reality, boring old “database technology” can (and has) already been efficiently solving many of these problems, for decades.
To address the three points you brought up:
1. We’ve had fault tolerant, ‘decentralized ledgers’ (aka distributed databases) for *way* before ‘blockchain’ was the hot buzzword. My current favorites are [Couchbase]( [etcd]( and [dgraph](
2. Even Bitcoin ain’t fully trustless—other systems are much less so. In a “private blockchain”, who gets to stamp off on what’s valid data or not, and what incentives do they have to keep the data, not act maliciously, etc? Hint: Bitcoin seems to have only just managed to align all incentives within its system in order to keep things working properly, and even then it’s not been an easy road to continued consensus
3. See point  above (and I’d add that if it’s not public, it’s much less easy/likely to be verified, secured, etc)

What about the business/market need makes you think things would become centralized?

Unless I'm missing something, there will be practically no barrier to entry for non-VC-backed/smaller-scale participants to get involved.

Except, it’s a ridiculously stupid combination of features that is super dangerous once you stop to think about it.
Good engineers wouldn’t dream of working on or promoting such a retarded product. However, it looks like the snake oil type of marketeers, unethical business owners, and their shills and blind followers won’t bat an eye if something makes no sense but still might make them a buck.

If you don’t have the private keys to your bitcoin, then you’re basically completely at the mercy of whatever decisions your wallet is (or is not) making regarding any forks. 
For example, people who left their bitcoin in a Coinbase wallet during the BCash fork were not able to sell their Bcash coins immediately, and won’t be able to till Coinbase allows them to (supposedly in January).

I really dig the overall tone of this video, and especially enjoyed the animation style!
My only critique would be that if this is supposed to appeal to a layperson, throwing around the term "crypto-anarchy" will likely either be scary or not make sense at all for most, and might throw off the rest of the friendly vibe of the video. 
I'd suggest maybe going with "voluntaryist" instead—it's not perfect, but in my opinion it's orders of magnitudes less threatening sounding than "crypto-anarchist"...

It seems that SegWit is helping ameliorate any supposed throughput and/or transaction fee issues just fine... there aren’t any technically strong arguments that I’m aware of for pushing for a larger block size currently, but I’d be happy to be educated on the issue.


It’s a hard fork, with no replay protection. If you don’t know why that’s dangerous, well, that’s exactly why it shouldn’t be done. Many uninformed people may end up losing money. The code for this fork is also basically only being worked on/supported by *one* developer, versus the *hundreds* who’ve worked on Bitcoin Core who nearly unanimously think this is a horrible idea.
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:50:55


Just to play devil’s advocate, even if any ‘statement’ were signed with a “known” Satoshi key, that would still ***not actually be conclusive evidence*** that the said statement was truly made by Satoshi. For example, someone could have stumbled into/stolen (a subset of) Satoshi’s private keys and ended up impersonating him/her/them.

Again though, how would you see this happening with LN if there is (from what it seems like to me) no point in time in which the value of LN "IOUs" can be completely decoupled from actual value on the blockchain (in other words, how would people be able to conjure up value on the Bitcoin blockchain the same way that occurred with fiat)?

I think a good amount of us bitcoiners would agree that we wouldn't want to repeat the past mistakes of decoupling value from the unit that's supposed to be a measure of it ;) 
However, I'm still not sure *how* you think this could happen thanks to LN. Maybe I'm missing something, but, if every LN channel must be opened (and closed) on the Bitcoin blockchain, there is no way for "fake" value to be injected into the system (no extra printing of bitcoins ala with fiat money)... right?

@_date: 2016-10-30 16:55:28
We might be more in agreement with each other than we thought.
But, tell me, what's the worst case scenario you can imagine with LN that would warrant you calling it "insidious" and comparing it to fiat? 
IMO, what made paper money/fiat worthless was how it got completely decoupled from the gold that used to back it. This meant that governments could print paper money at will, devaluing it at their leisure. Are you suggesting that something similar could occur in bitcoin due to LN? What would that look like? If every LN channel must be opened (and closed) on the Bitcoin blockchain, there is no way for "fake" value to be injected into the system (no extra printing of bitcoins ala with fiat money)... right?
@_date: 2016-10-09 17:28:12
In Bitcoin, whoever has the private key to an address is the one who is able to access and control the associated bitcoin. So if you have that, you're in direct control of your money. If not, you're not.

Every LN transaction can be broadcasted and collected into a block. They don't have to be if there is no dispute in a transaction and/or if a channel is not being closed out. Thanks to that, orders of magnitude more transactions will be doable without bloating the blockchain.

@_date: 2015-10-30 19:28:13
I'd argue that even prior to all the negative public sentiment brought on by MtGox, Silk Road, etc, "Bitcoin" was a pretty bad name for this technology, in part because it severely limits most people's thinking to just the currency aspect of the tech.
There needs to be a good umbrella term for ***trust-minimizing, censorship-and-tamper resistant information systems***. The problem with terms like "cryptocurrency", "cryptosystems", heck, "crypto"-anything, is that they are too scary/complicated-sounding for the average person, and don't necessarily express the breadth of the core technological innovation. So, it's totally understandable that "blockchain technology" has been picked up to try to give a friendlier name to the concept. Except that "blockchain technology" as a term is insufficient, because it's easy to co-opt its use for non-trust-minimizing, non-censorship-and-tamper resistant information systems. 
If you go back to the roots of who started really pushing forward these ideas, it was the [cypherpunks]( 
Which begs the question: why not use a word like "**cyphertech**" instead of "blockchain technology"? Cyphertech would encompass cyphercurrency, cypherledgers, cypherlaw, etc. These terms would all be much harder to co-opt than "blockchain"-anything, since the fundamental philosophy of what the cypherpunks stood for would be directly embedded in the words themselves. Just my 2 satoshis :)
@_date: 2015-10-31 01:19:02
From what I understand Hal Finney was part of the cypherpunk mailing list, and he had a pretty important role in the early days of bitcoin. Wei-Dai and Adam Back were also on the cypherpunks list, and are cited in the original whitepaper. 
I'm probably missing others since I don't know the history as well as I'd like to, but the cypherpunks, and their philosophical/political bent, appear pretty influential/integral to bitcoin... at least to me.

The adoption of Segwit and LN would very likely ameliorate the transaction fee problems that Erik states he's been facing. So I'd say that he doesn't have much room to complain if he/Shapeshift haven't actually been devoting many (any?) resources towards that goal. Beyond that, LN would also make the literal business of cross-chain atomic swaps fully trustless, unlike the current trust model required when using Shapeshift. This type of change in business might be off-putting to some business owners, but would arguably be a **huge** win for users...


Again, I beg to differ. Real Lightning transactions have already happened on Litecoin's mainnet.

Heck, Gavin's attempt at a contentious hard fork with ~~ClownCoin~~ Bitcoin "Classic" *appeared* to drum up the masses with very little PR savvy, whereas clearly there was a bit more planning in terms of literally garnering global attention with the whole Craig Wright situation.

The fact that r/btc is such a cesspool would lead one to believe that moderation can (and does) serve a useful purpose. 
Perhaps one might fault u/theymos for not being great at PR, the "censorship" meme was repeated so often that it ended up becoming some people's actual impression of what was going on. 
Bitcoin is similar to the Wild West—there are cowboys, but also snake oil salesmen and straight up criminals trying to take advantage of newcomers. If there were no rules whatsoever, lots of people could get hurt, and eventually the place would become a ghost town.
***Maintaining great signal to noise ratio*** is the meme that I think could have made for an antidote against the cries of "censorship".

I'm a developer in San Francisco and go to various bitcoin meetups, and it's depressing that in conversations sometimes it seems like the most rational decision if you want to build a business is to decide that you're going to have to leave the US to do so.
It's not just the uncertain (and overbearing) laws that weren't designed with something like bitcoin in mind that are the problem — it's that the legacy banking system here is (obviously) not playing nice with people trying to start legitimate bitcoin businesses.
