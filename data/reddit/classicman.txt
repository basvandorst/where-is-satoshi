I will try to find it, I'm using ufasoft now and all it does it lock down my computer without ever fully updated the block chain! Anything will be better than this lol. Thanks.

Word man. I'd tip ya to help out but I'm still low myself! Fallingpizza is a hero to me today.
What I'm doing to get some bit-by-bit (pun intended) is those sites that give you a little piece at a time for doing tasks. My favorite one is  just watch 3/4 of a video, put in the captcha, and get 25microbtc. You can also do simple google work for different award amounts. 
There is also a site called bitvisitor that works sometimes. and a site called bitcrate, but they run out of coins so fast I have yet to get any from that site. 
On all the exchanges, and on blockchain.info you can put real cash into it, but I'm trying to see what I can do without doing that. I don't trust handing out my Gov id yet, and also being a poor college kid I gotta save up for summer school. I'm really hoping these miner cards are relatively cheap....

Hey I tried gui miner with both btcguild and deepbit, it always got stuck on "nothing to mine on, exiting" , and would just hang there...

Thank you so much!! Thats like 5 days of doing those sites that give you microbtc for doing random tasks. People like you are helping secure btc. I can't wait these more affordable miners come out and we can all share!

Please do a post or send a pm to us when these are ready! I'm at 5M/hash on my laptop and it's just sad sitting at .00008 btc lol.
