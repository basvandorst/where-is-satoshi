The token stores the value from the day of the installation- value does not need to be a dollar amount. Value consists of the thousands of visitors, photos taken, excitement etc.
The token is not converted to cash, it allows for members to propose their designs for another temporary work of Architecture. 
Your criticism is misguided- and yes regulation was thought about.
Your hostility is also not appreciated

The token becomes "backed by a fund" that will then be spent on another installation that the decentralized community of Architects can propose and vote on

Er, I don't think you are really grasping the project.
The token organizes a community of Architects. Members can then propose the next installation that the fund can be used for.
Then another Architecture installation will be built.

The tokens are given for free. 
Where is this revenue you are referring to that token holders are not getting?

Is it possible to continue this conversation via another medium?

However, the Counterparty token did not fund the installation-- a Museum did
The token is given for free as a means to organize a community and a way to store the value of the installation.
The token will grow in value over time because it is 1. given for free and then 2. backed by a fund that is started after the installation material is sold.
