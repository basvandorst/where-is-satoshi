The whole process in 2017 was with a quick hype, then it stopped. Now it is a different situation. It's a slow process by it looks like a more reliable path.

You can download a Bitcoin wallet like 'Blockstream Green', set up the wallet, and write-down the mnemonic phrase (the recovery phrase). Then you can uninstall the wallet. It's a common practice, it's free and simple.
The paper edition is very good but you need to take care of the paper, and it goes through different digital assets too.

Exactly :)

You should know about the verification before order any Bitcoins. That's how it works at [BitIreland.ie](
About your issue, do you have access to your wallet private keys?
If the exchange has a mobile app, you can find email support or another type of contact information.
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:32:34
Credit cards only. The alternative is bank transfer
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:19:57
We have a few big advantages which make us different:
\- fast and reliable customer support
\- we do not keep your coins, upon order you will get them instantly in your wallet
The verification is necessary to avoid scam orders.
