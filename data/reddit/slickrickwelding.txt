Is there an app for this is is it solely a website?

My bank denies my transactions all the time. Tried to buy at 5200 then it dipped and it wouldn't allow me.

Wish I would have transferred fiat for BTC when it was at $300. I waited until $5600 to get my feet wet

I see a few. Which do I go with? I'm sorry for stupid questions but I just want to know more and more about this

I wish I would have gotten into BTC when I was younger. I found out about it when I was 15, so 5 years ago, and never thought anything of it. Boy do I regret that haha
