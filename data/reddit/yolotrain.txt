You make the mistake a lot of bad doctors make: mistake absence of evidence for evidence of absense. 
If you come up with a statistic that shows you war casualties since the World War II you can say almost nobody is dying in wars now, sure, but it's such a tiny segment in history that it's statistically insignificant - not evidence. . You can tell if a model is good by looking at how it holds up when extreme events happen. 
If you are claiming today is the most peacefull era in human history, while having the means to end entire civilizations at the same time, one real war that's not just a local skirmish would blow up your whole model.  
Saying it's a trend based on such a small set of data (our short era of peace) doesn't make much sense.
If you look at the war vs. peace periods in history, you'll find that wars today are getting shorter and less frequent. Problem is, only a person who doesn't have a clue about statistics would judge violence/wars by their frequency. You, of couse, must judge them by their impact/consequences. 
On the war vs. peace time axis, you'd find only very few tiny segments of war in the 20^th century (as they were very short) and going back, there would be less and less peace overall - the 17^th century would be pretty much all war and no peace.  
However, during that one tiny segment in the 20th century, more people died than in the rest (back to the 17^th century) combined.  
Having deadly means of mass destruction makes the wars less probable as nobody really wants a total war (giving us the illusion we're living in a safe world), but it also makes their impact (were a total war to happen) extremely destructive.
Kind of the same as when a financial crisis hits our centralized economies today. We've managed to minimize the volatility in the system to the point where it's all pretty much flat, but once something hits, the system blows up.
