Best friend recently had a kid (first one).  As a present for his birth, gave him $100 worth of silver coins and $100 worth of bitcoin.  I plan on allowing him to decide on future birthdays what he wants it in and eventually I'll ask the kid what he wants it in. 
Fairly sure I'll just do $100 total for future birthdays though.

For anyone wondering, their tea is awesome.

It will be interesting to see how this can be managed properly.  There is very little stopping a single person from creating 1,000 wallets, donating $100 worth of bitcoin to the same candidate and suddenly you've got a single individual donating $100,000 to a single candidate and no real way to trace things (to see if that person is even a US citizen or not).

How exactly does one run their own mint? 
Honestly, just curious.

The only addtional required item is some form of strainer.  I drink probably two pots a day, so what I have is a bit different than what you might buy.  For a single person looking to have a cup from time to time, I might consider getting a strainer/infuser ball (example   If you don't have a pot to boil the water, you could heat up the water in a microwave even, then take out, toss some leaves in the infuser and put in there to steep for 3-5 minutes.  
As a rep for company said, black tea's tend to work better with sugar / milk.  If you can go without the milk, just about any of your teas will do well with sugar (I prefer honey).  I'd consider getting a tester pack that has a bit of variety to try out.

OBS is an amazing piece of software.  Of course there are minor things here or there that myself and others would like to have in it, but for the price, I'll never complain!

Any Chrysanthemum on the horizon?  I go through a couple ozs of that a month (sound like an addict). 
Did buy a couple things though, thank you for this :)

Any way to run the node but not have the full blockchain download to your C: drive?  Got a smaller SSD as my main drive and would rather not have that taking up space.

Did they change the functionality since I last ran it (a year or more back), because prior it went into a folder in appdata/local and you had no choice in the matter.

He's pro defense spending (based on his recent votes)
He's against marijuana legalization (per his own words)
He's pro government telling a women and her doctor what they can or cannot do. (wants to make abortion illegal, so much for big government not telling people what they can or cannot do)
He's against same sex marriage (so much for individual rights)
The ONLY thing he's libertarian on is when it comes to the NSA.  Other than that, he's your typical pro-business GOP candidate.  His recent flip on defense spending shows he will happily do what big business tells him to do if it helps get him elected.

I'd just like to say your customer service is really awesome.  My wife loved the notebook she got and I figured it looked a bit better in the board room then anything else on the market.  Shortly after the seem started to unravel a bit and your customer service sent a replacement almost instantly.  We've now got 3 notebooks and 3 of the pocket notebooks as well and they just have a great feel to them.  I looked at them specifically because of your use of bitcoin and I'm probably never looking back.

Yeah, but not pro-legalization? 
He's not a libertarian.  He just uses that as a buzzword so college kids will like him.

Okay, you work a job for 100k a year for a long time, and via that you've managed to save $250k in a savings account that is direct deposit every paycheck, no other transactions in or out of that account, it's 100% legit and clean. 
During that time frame you were also embezzling.  During that time you were able to steal $2 million from the company, and you've been using that to live on as well.  
Well, you've been caught.  The feds come in and they find two accounts, one with the embezzled money totaling $1 million, and one clean account worth $250k.  But, how clean is the $250k considering the reason you've been able to build that amount of money is due to the illegal activities you've been doing?  Isn't it reasonable to consider you would have been unable to save the same amount had you not been embezzling?
If you are found guilty, the federal government will be ordering you to pay back not the $1 million you have of dirty money, but the full $2 million you stole.  
Therefore, to protect the interests of those you stole from, that $250k of 'clean' money is locked away until the trial is completed.  
Now, I'm not stating whether I am for or against this, I'm just putting the government's argument into a more realistic manner is all.

Working for the company, I can see how they would have some issues with it (please note, nothing I'm about to say is official, its all my personal view on things, 100% opinion).  I'd like to state I own some bitcoins, I believe in the currency and what it will do down the line to change thing, especially feel its going to make an impact on things like international transactions. 
The biggest problem I see is the current volatility of bitcoin pricing.  I'll try to give some examples how that would be of issue for a major corporation.  
Say you purchase a TV that's currently on sale for $600, the bitcoin price just so happens to be that, simple enough.  What happens 2 weeks from now when the price of bitcoins is $700?  Some things to keep in mind as to why its an issue.. 
Do they return you $600, $700, 1 bitcoin or .86 bitcoin?  In their mind, you paid $600, regardless of the form of currency, so you'll probably get either $600 or .86 bitcoin back.  That's going to upset a lot of customers that might feel they got ripped off.  
If they sell it to you in bitcoins, then return in $, are they a defacto exchange?  That is definitely not something they want to even risk getting labeled as.  They also are beholden to the shareholders who as a whole, won't take kindly to the idea of having bitcoins at the moment (even if it would be a smart move down the line).  Which means they're going to have to do something to exchange all that bitcoin into fiat instantly.  Are they going to use bitpay?  Honestly, Best Buy revenues = $50 billion.  At what point would bitpay not be able to keep up?  $1 million?  $10 million?  $100 million?  I don't think they'd like the risk of "Oh, I knew we told you this person paid, but we don't have the money to give you for it, sorry"
That actually brings up another point.  One of the things Best Buy is greatly pushing is the fact that you can buy online, pick up in the store.  I don't currently work at the store and do not know personally, but I would think anything pushing 30 minutes from order to available to pickup would be considered a lot.  Do we suggest that Best Buy suddenly slow down their pickup process to make sure the proper 5 confirmations come through?  Or do you think they should do less confirmations?  I'm fairly sure they'd want as much confirmation as possible if someone is purchasing a $2,000 TV to be picked up in a moment. 
Just some thoughts that popped into my head, would love to hear people address them.

Since the security issue has already been mentioned, I'm going to mention speed. 
There are some solutions to it being developed, but it means being done outside of the chain itself.  A proper confirmation of a transaction could take upwards of an hour.  In today's environment, that's just too long to be practical in a lot of environments (bars, stores, restaurants, etc).  Currently the only recourse is to basically 'trust' the person you are dealing with that the unconfirmed transaction is actually legit.

I can see the Consumerist Article now:
"Best Buy sells item for 1 bitcoin, will only return .86 worth of bitcoin back!!" 
Just saying.

Late to the party, but whatever.  Just posted the following... 




Not a libertarian, I don't believe the world is going to end in economic disaster, but I still think bitcoin is a good thing and I think more companies / people should take advantage of it. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:32:25
Got to remember the Best Buy is doing everything it can to show why its worth buying there and not Amazon or somewhere else online.  One of the advantages is the fact that if you buy it online, you can have it shipped to you or pick it up in the store.  An added benefit is that if you don't want it, just take it to any store and return it, no big deal.  I don't think they would want to start making exclusions as to who could make a return instore and who couldn't.  And if they decided to allow instore returns on items purchased via bitpay / bitcoin, what would prevent Best Buy being used as a one day bitcoin exchange?  Would probably at that point be one of the easiest ways to convert bitcoins to fiat in the US and quickly.

I think its an awesome idea and looks great, but since you've got the private and public key, how is this really safe?  Anyone doing this would have to trust you that you aren't saving that information without their knowledge, not sure how many people would be willing to do that. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:42:27
Doesn't the price volatility cause issues with stores trying to accept bitcoin as payment?  Would they constantly need to change theatre pricing to compare properly with USD for example?  Wouldn't this be an issue for merchants that are considering using bitcoin?
