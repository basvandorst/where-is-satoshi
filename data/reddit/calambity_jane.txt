Why do people who don't believe in the idea of time travel even bother clicking on a disscussion link about time travel?

Yes, the standard would have change to BTC/Satoshis which inevitably will when the dollar starts to crash on it overly inflated self.
Then the �� will come when Bitcoin goes from 9k too 50k - 100K then to 1M

I've been reading a lot of related topics about how  time travel could be in fact possible with the right technology. So to think this guy could have been wasn't ruled out in my book.
Maybe it sounds a little crazy...But truth seems to be  stranger then fiction

Yes, absolutely! BITPAY IS A SCAM! 
My husband &amp; I used Bitpay for about a year untill they they became salty about some of the fees they had to pay due to us travelling for a few months. At the time he had about $130 on the Bitpay card and they decided to out of the blue to lock it down. He called Bitpay got the run around with a very rude customer service rep which informed him he now had to "prove his identity by sending them copy of his social security card". This wasn't the first time they played the "lock our card game either". We don't like bank for exactly these issues...So my husband decided to close the account and find another option for our crypto needs. Well, unfortunately 
at this point the rep on the phone took it personal and decided to put him on hold to check with a supervisor on "if she is allowing to close the account and issue our funds."
She then returned to inform him he STILL had to prove his identity in order for them to now issue the remaining balance.
He refused saying he had already verified his ide ty when applying for the card and to send the remaining funds to his address on file(which he also verified over the phone 10 minutes prior) But Bitpay has now decided to hold his funds hostage. 
My best advice is to report Bitpay to the Consumer Protection Bureau. Just like you would with a bank that would illegally holding your fiat after closing your account.
Good luck &amp; BOYCOTT BITPAY!

I was being kinda sarcastic lol 
I meant bullish in the sense that because he says Bitcoin is a ongoing growing problem. One can only assume that would mean the price would increase due to everyone eventually realizing they can take their hard earn currency of inflated centralized fiat and put it into a deflationary decentralized currency.

I got banned for saying he should stop scammed people into thinking he has anything to do with the real BTC and call himself what he really is. A shitcoin called Bcash. 
There should be a forum called "Shitcoiners" and we can start with tagging Ver &amp; Wright

You think someone would tell these snakes to stop expression so much fear and dislike for Bitcoin. They are just getting everyone more excited for their destruction.
@_date: 2019-11-08 00:53:37
I'm using the current standard of fiat to make my point...
When Bitcoin increases in value. Everyone will have more of a sellable and buyable asset.

About 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked—without an account at a financial institution or through a mobile money provider. The system and government in place is not working properly.
@_date: 2019-08-31 14:38:59
No one makes it out of this world alive.
 One day you will all know the truth. 
Those who believe - use your time wisely 
Those who don't believe - use your time wisely
As for Bitcoin - No one rules BTC, it's for everyone and anyone that wants it. That's the beauty.
@_date: 2019-08-31 14:46:14
Agreed education is the key for sure. 
However, in the case of fiat, it seems that human nature always seem to fall into the trap of greed. If the ones running the system can manipulate it to get more for themselves, eventually the bad eggs will ruin it for the rest.
The only true fix is Satoshi's genius plan to make decentralized.

The really despicable part of this isn't the drugs sold or money used but the fact that the United States is the is the most corrupt, hypocritical, drug  dealing, tyrants in the world. Waging war on a yobe who doesnt bond to their will. Starting with their own citizens. The government wants to just want to rule the world with an iron fist. Mad that some guy made a website made tons cash and BTC and where people have the choice to buy what they want, when they want and how much they want. It's not another person's right to say what you can or cannot do with your money. The United States says it was stopping some drug lord but the truth is it wasn't "protecting the people". They were protecting THEMSELVES and their WEALTH and POWER. 
Crooks. Hypocrites. Tyrants.

I just have one important question. 
Why...WHY WHY is Bcash still being traded on ANY exchange??? ��‍♀️
@_date: 2019-10-16 08:14:00
Price goes up = Hodl
Price goes down = But more BTC &amp; Hodl

It's just an on ramp for the big guys to buy in "legally and safely" 
It will help boost BTC when it gains more attention in the upcoming months

It may seem like that day is far far away. The 1% controlling the banks and governments want you to think that the system is strong, healthy and will be around forever. But if you look into the monetary system and where we are in the world today, you will see that almost every country(some worse then others) are currently drowning in debt and poverty
People of all countries are getting fed up with struggling and getting manipulated. Look at France. And now with the internet allowing us all to learn and see the truth, it only a matter of time before everyone catches one. Heck even JP Morgan, the Bitcoin basher is "jumping on the band wagon" with their own digital currency.
My advice: Put $50 in your personal bank account and then put $50 in Bitcoin. Watch them both and in 1 year see for yourself what works better.
@_date: 2019-08-31 14:26:29
Bitcoin is a revolution.
 It's freedom from the tyrannical banks and loosens the stronghold of corrupt governments. 
Countries will try to make their own currency  to try and regulate, tax, and control but just wait and watch.
In the end - Bitcoin will prevail. 
The only ones who won't use it will be the sheeple that think the system is "working".
But they will get the hint real quick when they start getting left behind and their money disappears.

This is just the beginning, I foresee a lot of changes in the global economy. Governments won't be able to stop it. Countries won't be able to stop it. Laws won't be able to stop it   Finally the money is going back to the hands of where it belongs - in the hands and pockets of the PEOPLE! ✊

I really can't stand this guy. Not only did he lose a sh*t ton of BTC in the early days of Bitcoin. But now he thinks he's some time of veteran that can offer advice and troll other crypto players in the market. A lot of his predicts are wild, never come to fruition and his 'bets' if you can even call them that, are wild speculations based on his 'market watching skills'
The best advice is DON'T listen to this guy. Don't believe the FUD and HODL BTC!

You should just store your private keys in it and use it as cold storage for your BTC.
Get a second wallet that has a trash can on it and put your fiat in that ����

I've never known a Bitcoin beliver to make a statement like :
"This edgy bullcrap sounds really intellectual untill you start thinking about it" OR "A single bitcoin doesn't matter"
Either your a uneducated, a FUD spreader or just a troll.
The ENTIRE point of Bitcoin as a decentralized global currency is the give everyone (especially) 3rd world countries, a far shot. That's my point.
1.7 billion people remain unbanked in the entire world because they aren't deemed worthy by the elite. It only takes a few satoshis to make a difference between food and no food for some people. YOU clearly are the one that doesn't understand sh*t, sitting in a nice safe home with food in your fridge and a job to go to. 
You came on this post smeared FUD and then try to back peddle and say your a believer after I called you out.
Either contribute some knowledge to the post or own up to being a hater.  First do a little more backround on how important "a fuckton of little pieces" really is to some people.
We're not talking about green party hats, we are talking about a global currency.
