Yes, I get that having a paid off car is better than payments every month but the whole point of this whole HODL/Satoshi/Bitcoin meme on cars was to show that people missed out. If I saw this IRL I wouldn’t be very envious. And we’re only saying “what if he paid off the car” because it’s such an average car lol.

You said Ron Paul was “kicking butt”. You’re joking, right? 
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:22:41
Well honestly that was part of the investment you put into bitcoin. Regulations and adoption of the currency is at best coming soon or to be determined altogether.

Are you really that delusional to think the reason Venezuela’s economy is failing is because they need to utilize Bitcoin? As much as Bitcoin goes against the grain of traditional currencies, this sub should be figuring out ways to integrate bitcoin into the financial mainstream because it’s an all of the above strategy rather than bitcoin or crypto only. Posts like this make this sub seem stupid. I know we’re not all economists here but we need to still use some common sense.

The premise of your question, in my opinion, is seriously flawed. For example, just because domestic political turmoil in the US is at unprecedented levels because of our resident idiot Trump, doesn’t mean that we are any more or less safe. You also make similar assumptions here with Russia and North Korea (ie Today’s Russia is no comparison to the Cold War, NK has had the capability to start nuclear and chemical war for decades and hit US bases in the Asia Pacific region with over 100k troops in the periphery of our allies Japan and South Korea). All of this to say that you should check your assumptions about the current political environment and the factors that drive military conflict. 
Now, what’s actually factual is that deaths per capita in the East Asian region are practically zero post WWII because of US deterrence and the defeat of Imperial Japan. US deterrence and bilateral and multilateral cooperation have and will continue to be the pillars of preventing conflict in the region. Contrary to popular belief, war in the region is highly unlikely. It may be slightly higher because of Trump, but, what you have to realize is that war is a zero sum game for Koreans (and all those around them, which include US soldiers and citizens). North Korea has ballistic missiles pointed directly at South Korea and all hell can break loose within minutes. In the defense industry we talk about missile defense systems and trajectories and killing projectiles at the very beginning or end of their trajectory... but no missile defense exists for a missile heading straight towards Seoul killing millions (and vice versa because we have decapitation plans for the NK regime). The problem is that NK has been securing ballistic missiles and hiding them in unknown locations on land and now sea because they’ve increased their sub capabilities. It’s very hard to locate subs and secure those weapons in the possibility of war. Their missile that can have a nuke on it (Taepodong 2) that can supposedly hit the US has only been tested on a physical launch pad whereas shorter range missiles only required TELs. 
Ok it’s midnight my time right now so I’m just gonna stop here. I forgot what my point was but you’re assessment on East Asia is flawed. 
I actually know fuck all about block chain technologies though. But I used to work for the government on national security matters so I thought it’d be worth saying this lol.

Bieber at it again smh

Yes, if you actually do this in real life, it is a cause for concern if you apply for a security clearance. It's a valid ad. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:16:56
Kind of sad lol

Ah, the Libertarian wing of r/Bitcoin. Hate to break it to you, but you’re still listening to Ron Paul in 2018... going into 2019. When was he relevant again? Oh right... You’re a joke. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:44:41
Korean and Japanese conglomerates working together on something other than Lotte... Now that's funny. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 06:52:04
I’ve rejected Ron Paul’s calls for the gold standard all my life and I turned out okay. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:34:07
Except Samsung is a Korean company, not Japanese. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:10:05
You fucking cucklord. Lawyer up and post about that. Until then no one wants to keep hearing the same story over and over again.
