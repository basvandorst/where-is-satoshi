Helpful thoughts about what? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:19:49
Been using Gemini for a few months. I like it. On occasion deposits take a bit longer than advertised, but it's nice that you can start buying right away (though you're limited to $500 a day). They have an interesting fee structure based on the volume of your trades, so take a look at that. Also, you can only buy BTC and ETH which may or may not be an issue for you. Like any other exchange, the site goes down from time to time. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:25:28
Terrible advice. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:26:35
Up over 21% in the last 24 hours. What would you call that? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:38:28
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:21:56
It's all good--I wish I was wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:52:04
Looking good at the moment on GDAX!
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:43:26
Assuming of course that people are still selling (a safe bet no doubt) in the imagined scenario. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:20:43
Boing, boing, boing.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:20:56
Good to see that we're in the green for the moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:50:12
Where did these buys come from?!!!
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:02:20
I'm HODLing and buying. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:19:20
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:43:30
Apparently it's breaking some important resistance lines...could be a fun few days! 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:48:47
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:19:21
Hard to say. Maybe buy some now and wait and see (cost averaging). 
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:08:19
Is it really staying above 15.1K? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:12:05
In part because media headlines are stupid. Reuters: "South Korea plans to ban cryptocurrency trading..." They are looking to more regulation and raided exchanges demanding tax info though and clarified officially that they aren't banning trading, but that is a mouthful and won't get as many clicks. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:00:29

Because he's a fictional character written by fallible writers. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:58:50
Signs of resistance at 14K. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:42:00
So that was anti climactic...
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:00:34
Are you trying to make a quick buck and swing trade? Or are you wanting to invest for a while and see where it leads? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:46:38
Yep...here comes the dump

RESIST BTRASH!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:46:57
Watching trades on GDAX now...someone posted 250 btc  sheesh. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:59:38
Aaaaand GDAX is down again. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:01:17
sooooo close to 12K...
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:55:53
Show ain't over since nobody can actually trade or buy BCH on coinbase/GDAX yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:49:38
rrrrright 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:50:03
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:11:00
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:17:25
Perhaps the disproportionately tall BCH sell wall is restoring the status quo now. People were probably liquifying to get into BCH in case a green wall was going to be bigger and now are returning to their non-BCH coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:06:08
Thx. So I guess I don't understand who will offer the bet given that a drop is inevitable. Doesn't it take two sides to make a wager? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:38:02
Bitcoin has the potential to grow exponentially, but it could also be worthless. Most of us think the likelihood of the former is higher than the latter in the long run. The other side of the calculation is how much it would hurt you to lose the few hundred you're thinking about investing (in the event that bitcoin tanks) compared to how much it would help (make you happy) if Bitcoin continued to grow...these will depend entirely on details of your situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:12:12
Then give me all your fake money. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:05:45
I can't really help you with that kind of advice. Nobody knows whether it'll dip another thousand in a minute or go up another thousand...I've made over 100% return on my investments by buying a little at at time over 3 months... in reality, that's a pretty quick buck. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:07:23
that bitch 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:58:48
Possibly, but if you've been around a while you've seen many dips come and go with higher lows and higher highs to follow. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:52:30
Huge sell wall on GDAX @  210 BTC...
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:53:52
Huge sell wall on GDAX @  210 BTC...
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:09:32
Of course, it could keep growing even if not at the current rate. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:54:51
There are now over 309 for trade, at the price! People raking in profits...
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:26:49
What a sweet wife. Here's to BTC rocketing for people like her. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:00:27
Yeah I've worried about wall street pumping too so I see where you're coming from. But am I crazy for thinking that the gains we've seen are too modest for such a pump scenario to have occurred? We are talking about real money coming in after all. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:29:48
everytime...I remember after the China ban, and after the Segwti2x news...we saw major dips followed by "dead cat bounce" comments. And I just keep making that money by HODLing and buying in the dips. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:58
i'm going to puke
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:08:26
Lot's of people aren't selling. There are traders who are buying and selling and people who hold it as an investment for various amounts of time. But some are HODLers. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:15:15
Remember to zoom out everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:48:01
Anyone else watching the trades right now? I'm watching huge volumes of buys and sells being posted on gdax for LTC and ETH, but not for BTC... any idea why or what this might mean?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:00:26
Hmmm Coinbase is showing BCH @ $2931...Dammit I wanted to sell mine @ $9500!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:29:03
It is crazy...
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:08:04
Cheers mate! Enjoy the profits. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:47:49
Holy shit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:46:24
Good point. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:00:08
One possibility:someone wants to buy on the cheap. Sell off a significant amount and take some profits and also make the price drop by causing panic from weak hands, then buy again when it's low. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:26:42
Need to pay more for cold storage. Get a Ledger S Nano--tons of people have talked about here. Trezor is another trusted brand. 
Google the devices to see why they differ from a USB. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:42:52
I just buy (when I think there's a dip) and hold. I don't sell. I just don't have enough trust in myself to time the markets sufficiently. I suspect if I tried, I'd win some and I'd lose some...and at the end of the day, I'd have just stressed myself out for no real gain and possibly at a loss. In the long(ish) run, the value keeps going up. So I  recommend just buying and hanging on. But obviously your mileage will vary. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:00:27
i've been thinking the same thing...
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:02:39
I've been watching an ask of 100 BTC at 10.5K appearing and disappearing for a while now, on a ticker...what is that about? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:14:40
FU team red.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:17:46
I don't get it... Why do you listen to music? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:20:37
You'll get it at 16K. When you buy from the Coinbase interface you lock in the price they show you--it's usually higher than if you did a limit sale on GDAX, and you incur fees.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:15:35
Sorry, it just takes that long...Maybe you can try the wire transfer? You might also try Gemini--they basically credit you something like up to $500/day when you initiate the deposit so you can buy the coin immediately, but you can't actually move the coin from their exchange until the money has cleared from your account (which can take a week or more). 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:45:13
Right? It's buried by a pile of crap. I just posted a link of the vid in the daily price discussion thread...
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:11:16
Posted my sell for BCH. Good riddance. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:46:46
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:33:57
my bad...I often miss sarcasm even in non virtual interactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:48:06
Depends on your financial situation and whether you're in it for the long haul or not. But for many of us, buying a bit at a time seems to work out best because timing the market is difficult. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:09:02
Thx, though I'm already zoomed out to the max. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:13:15
To be sure, I have no way of knowing that it was a single person. I think it's interesting though that there are effectively sell walls right now. Even as we speak, 71.6 btc @ $11K, 104.7 etc @ $10.999K, 100 btc @ $10.998...
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:45:33
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:32
Well, one hypothesis is that Coinbase is where new users are inclined to go. So if the recent rise is due largely to new comers, it makes sense that it's trading higher on GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:39:08
Yeah I wish I could--I've depleted my crypto investment budget for the time being...but if not...
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:03:21
Calling everything 'fud' has got to stop.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:45:48
oh gotcha the nice hash hack.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:11:01
This is an important question. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:13:09
Congrats all!
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:14:11
well that was nice while it lasted. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:44:50
I should add that you need to ask yourself what you want out of BTC and where you think it's headed. I'm thinking that $11K is nothing and the growth potential is exponential. That's largely why I buy and hold, but don't bother selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:07:21
Obviously Corncoin and Coincorn are next. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:53:22
Anyone else watching trades? It's strangely quiet at the moment---very shallow candles. What's up?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:02:30
Why can't you make an honest living? Why try to rip others out of their hard earned money? Get lost dirtbag. It's because of people like you that I have to have several locks on my doors, locks on my car doors, an alarm, a million passwords and 2FA, etc...
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:30:06
This is excellent and thoughtful. Thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:34:30
GDAX just added bcash trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:49:37
Could this be a dump to shake coins out of weak hands and buy on the cheap?
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:09:42
I'm actually happy to have a boring day. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:37:05
Some resistance at 15..
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:01:40
ETH ain't safe if this thing tanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:44:11
dipping, not crashing. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:27:25
You could be right. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:41
You should be fine with coinbase. Chances are some employees + family and friends got in on some insider info and made away with some money in this recent episode---that's about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:16:34
You should try panic HODLing. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:53:09
here, here!
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:17:20
chewed through it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:40:56
I thought people were saying they would short it by first pumping? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:44:36
They're not gone--press the plus sign on the "aggregation" line. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:01:54
The real price is what people are willing to pay for it--just like anything else. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:48
yeah couldn't sell if we wanted to.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:47:56
You're right, it's now 16.3K ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:04:39
yep looks that way.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:04:43
If I had planned a dinner for 5, in order to make money off of them, and left the door wide open so that I could make even more money for myself, and 40 showed up, it would no doubt slow my service down, but I'd also expect my all my "guests" to get pissed off at me. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:09:33
You can't wait for so many people to get hurt? You sound like a sociopath. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:49:15
You do you homie. Best of luck! I guess I just don't understand why everyone's so gloom and doom about futures contracts.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:28:09
But they need people betting long right? And who will do that given the recent parabolic movement? Just trying to understand...
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:30:26
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:11:51
Okay now that we've tested the floor, let's see the new ceiling. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:04

@_date: 2017-12-06 19:12:15
now it's official
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:10:18
Perhaps soon to be testing a new high? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:06:01
Been watching GDAX...and while it's very close I didn't see it breach 13K. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:40:35
and a is a. He asked the USD price...
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:05:06
I just love watching the sell walls getting chewed up. It's better than TV. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:13:19
Right. Aiming to own 1 bitcoin is arbitrary. We can speak of Satoshi's after all (0.00000001 of 1 bitcoin) or any number of granularities that we can invent, if we like. I'm paying attention more to how much fiat I've put in and what percentage of potential ROI I'm seeing based on that.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:36:30
Andreas Antonopoulos is optimistic about CME futures: worth a [watch]( For the impatient, start at around the 6:40 mark. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:18:33
Probably when we least expect it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:25:41
This is true. Here's hoping the past is a good indication of the future in this case. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:43:16
i don't know about a dive...a small dip maybe. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:12
yeah it's way sketch. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:33:04
Nice to see it back at 16K. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:52:54
The trade volume is fairly low for BTC. Maybe I'm not reading the logs right, but I don't see very big sell walls as I have in the past. If I'm right that the trade volume is relatively low, it seems much easier to manipulate market prices right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:56:39
A little sell wall at 11.8K. That seems to be the magic number. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:50:27
So they are dumping ahead of futures contracts? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:30:05
Happy 12K day!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:15
Wait, what?!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:52:05
This is true. I guess the question is whether we're close to the point of not seeing high returns. If new fomo buyers are largely responsible for the recent upsurge, that would devolve into a question about whether we're nearing the point of exhausting that pool. If not, then (other things being equal) we should continue to see big returns. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:58
The whales on twitter are laughing about the weak hands giving over cheap coins to them. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:28:36
If you're worried about losing $100, you probably shouldn't be investing in crypto. I'm not trying to be a jerk, but it's a volatile market. Big swings happen all the time. Even in the very recent past, we've seen substantial swings, but so far, BTC seems to come up on top. You could very well lose your money, but most of us here are betting that BTC will pull through again. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:25:48
this is insanity.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:42:59
why are 61mil dollars about to be unloaded?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:00:04
I'm so sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:58:56
Can some please explain to me how buys and sells work? For instance, I'm noticing (on GDAX) that there are a lot of coins for sale at $10,931.01. These are the lowest prices that I can see. On the other hand, the highest buying price that I can see is just one cent below that and yet the number of coins at the price for sale keeps changing and buys keep going through at $10,931.00. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:39:25
Yeah. And Coinbase just tweeted that they have strict internal guidelines and don't permit their employees from trading BCH. Sure...
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:49:24
lol exactly... 'This' is an indexical.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:40:49
After several tries I was able to get my fiat out (to my coinbase wallet), but I still have some tokens stuck on gdax. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:35:07
Wow 9,200! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:54
So ETH and LTC are dropping too, but BCH is steady... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:55
Historically, after big gains it seems to drop and then rally up to new heights. It's unclear how much we can depend on historical trends of course...that's the guessing game. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:33
The big money probably have their own backdoors...
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:46:57
Thanks, me too.
