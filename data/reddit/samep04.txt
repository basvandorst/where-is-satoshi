none of my bitcoins WAS stolen. ftfy
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:01:30
similar to welding cats? do you weld cats together? do you use the cats to weld things? do you only weld metal into sculptures of cats? do you cat the cats with cats/welds? catwelder?
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:56:15
yes, but that has nothing to do with what i've said. "none" is a contraction of "not one." 
so you say "one bitcoin was stolen."
 or "not one bitcoin was stolen."
 or "none was stolen"
you wouldn't say "one were stolen." the same way you wouldn't say "none were stolen."

How the hell are you going to create something Ike Amazon simply by accepting a different payment? You got two day shipping on rare items? You got original content on a globally available streaming service for Bitcoin? You got widespread adoption of retailing trends worldwide, shippable at a moment's notice? You got easily downloadable literary content on almost any kind of device anywhere anytime for basically free? Because you accept Bitcoin????
No. No you do not.
Just solve the problem of current retailers accepting Bitcoin. It's like you want to climb a mountain to make a snowcone

Investment timeframe. Does a person expect a "7% near-market return in a year? do they expect that same 7% in a month? Do they expect to invest "while it's cheap" and hold their investment until they cash out at (what they believe to be) a huge rate of return? 
that is the definition of holding/hodling

impatient people are two types: those who lose money, or those who have enough money to affect a spike in their favor and then do so.

yep. just as if you were sending money to anybody else's wallets as payment for anything.

you guys have taken this too far. i know what a white elephant gift is. This whole exercise was to see if there were easy/common/popular methods to gift bitcoin in person. I wanted to see if that is a platform that needed to be developed, or an already established market. 
Thank you for the lecture, tho. perhaps you should read it when deciding to "give a person something they didn't really ask for even tho you think they might want it"

oh that's pretty good. Create a paper wallet for them, put some money in that. 
Let's say this person now has ~$25 worth of btc in there and the address. Recommendations for super entry level ways to use this bitcoin?

as  previously stated, you can get a paper wallet address, send money to that address, and it's yours. It's almost the same as a personal check: numbers on the paper have your account number and the amount that's in it, you control the funds.

Sabra, a dip company with the letter B in it, had better start advertising for Bitcoin. "By the dip" and/or a dip called "HODLmole"

Are you guys all gambling? Is it price you're betting on? 
Is it not the historically right way to invest in the future VALUE of assets? 
Should we not be focusing on businesses that are showing good metrics? Companies that are doing the right things, and things that people do want and will be more valuable in the future? 
Let's say you buy an investment property, a 3BR house. And you're solely counting on selling it in 5 years for more than you bought it for, because you believe that that particular house is the kind of house people want, in an area people want to live. You think even more people Will want houses like yours in the coming years. Supply/demand says the price of your house goes up.
In the meantime, the market shifts downward, lowering the price of your house. Do you give a shit? No. Because you believe in the future value of your asset. You hadn't planned on selling this year. You said a few years from now. You make long term bets on expensive and risky investments. 
Price of your house goes down this year, you don't care. 
Long term bets. 
You don't gamble.
You evaluate assets and believe in their long term value. 
Sell when you feel you've profited enough that you value the cash more than the asset. When you'd rather have the money than future money it could produce.
Stop caring if it went up today

Simple and easy strategy. Video could be improved by stating at the beginning what the strategy is. So in the first minute just say, "this is what we do: buy 'here' and we look for 'this', then we sell 'here'." And THEN showing the examples. I wasn't sure what I was looking for until halfway through the video.

You have a blue dollar and a green dollar, and everyone only accepts green dollars, now. What is the likelihood of someone accepting blue?
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:01:39
But Steve over there will take blue dollars all day! He's got millions of blue dollars! What are those millions of blue dollars worth? Only what he can trade for them. Maybe it now takes 200,000 blue dollars for a candy bar.aybe they won't take them at all. Who knows? When the majority decides on a currency and value, it is unlikely that a competitor will be any measure of successful with a competing currency
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:24:41
I agree with you: this Is a subject that people should be paying attention to. People don't much care if their "assets" (like crops) turn into potatoes or jelly beans or bitcoins, as long as they receive their fair share. And as long as that commodity can be traded for other equal things.
Currency may be the next big thing.

Guessing he doesn't know for sure, rather is saying that the value halves/forks so.ehow and you either have value on one chain or another and briefly it is undecided which is the more valuable fork. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:30:02
I'm going on a whim here and saying that, once you said: "I truly do not respect the fabric of your brain" I stopped believing that you were an objectionable voice. Speculation at best. 
Take this with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2019-05-04 19:14:12
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:40:44
But why would he do that? If you've got the most valuable currency, why would you trade them for USD??? Clearly the dollar isn't doing as well as BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:39:21
You "would" have Bitcoin on both chains with a hard fork, but after enough people said "`we dont like that other fork, we won't confirm it" then the value of the Bitcoin on that particular fork has become zero, since nobody will be trading any of those. It's like saying "oh we changed the currency from green to blue. All green currency is not worth anything" even though you might have some.
