There's no way to tell for sure since it's really up to the SEC, but the twins filed an S1 last October so it's been ongoing for a year already and we've had recent progress like the Nasdaq choosing a symbol for it and posting numerous articles about it. It seems like everything is pretty much good to go at this point and all that's left is the green light from the SEC which could happen at anytime.
Also, according to Barry Silbert, he plans to bring the Bitcoin Investment Trust to a publicly traded setting this Q4 on the OTCCQX so if things go according to plan we would have two publicly available choices. We also have the Nasdaq Vice President of Transaction Services and Head of ETF business David LaValle calling the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust a "significant" development for the exchange-traded fund industry in August. I don't know why there's so much negativity right now from you guys, but these things are definitely happening, it's just a matter of when.

I use Amazon every week while I'm at school to buy things. The student Prime deal is amazing. Not to mention I watch amazon instant video on my Xbox one a good amount.
I would be so happy if I could pay for all my amazon stuff (including prime membership) with bitcoin. I would also probably be much more likely to pay for microtransactions  if they added some i.e. extra original content.

No, not at all. Bitcoin holds a lot of promise in developing countries for many reasons. It can bring financial freedom to people who 1) Can't trust their financial institutions and get their bank accounts seized or suffer from incredibly high inflation i.e Argentina as one good example, 2) Don't have access to bank accounts in the first place (2.5 billion people), and 3) Are getting robbed blind by Western Union/Money Gram for remittance payments. Global Remittance payments were over 500 billion last year and Western Union and Money Gram charge anywhere from 10-25% to send money to poor countries. In fact, the poorer the country, the more they charge. 
Once the bitcoin education is there and the ATMs are up and there are ways to exchange bitcoin for their local currency then these people can receive money from their family members working overseas for 1% fees instead of 20% without even having to leave their homes and it happens instantly. We are talking about BILLIONS of dollars of hard earned money that are lost to these money transfer agents who take multiple days to transfer the money then rob you of a quarter of it. Moreover, I've read lots of cases where there are thugs who wait outside these places and charge a cover fee just to get it to get your money.

The goal is that once the infrastructure is built out worldwide (places like Africa, India, Philippines, and all the other developing countries that badly need this technology)  the transaction volumes will go up, the ability to exchange bitcoin for local currencies will increase, and merchants won't dump 100% of bitcoin for fiat. These developments will subsequently lead to the whales having less power because their bitcoins aren't the majority of bitcoins available at any given time. 
We still have a ways to go before this reality is fully realized, but people like Draper, Andreessen, Silbert, Pierce, and so many others are pouring money into infrastructure development as fast as they can.

I just looked at that thread for the first time and the top comment is from someone who more recently reached out to the lawyer and her response was:
Dear Taylor,
I did speak with a Bitcoin investor about 15 minutes ago, although I was unaware that he intended to quote me or otherwise discuss our conversation. Your message is a useful reminder that I shouldn’t hazard any guesses. The SEC has warned me not to provide people with possible speculative information about the complicated process of launching a new securities product for public sale, so I have been saying either (1)“it could take quite a while, like a year” or (2)“there is really no way to tell, since the regulatory process is very complicated, especially with respect to a new asset like bitcoin.” From now on, I’ll just use statement (2), so if you want to quote me, just use that one. Thanks so much,

No..I want that thug to have to find a different way to make money that isn't robbing people and I want Western Union to either adapt to this new paradigm or go out of business. 
I hold bitcoin because I see the potential it has to help out billions of people and I'm also in the beginning stages of building a business around it as well. The economic liberty a decentralized system like this can bring to billions around the world is staggering. Why are you so resistant to it? Just because it's down 60% after a 1000% move that happened over 6 weeks last year?

I attended the cryptocurrency convention in nyc last month and Pierce was the main guest speaker. 
He's probably the biggest investor in bitcoin startups (him and Marc Andreessen) and is doing a lot to further the infrastructure. He said his most recent investment was in a company that wanted to distribute low cost feature phones with sim cards to Africa that came ready to use bitcoin apps.
This guy is already playing a big part in mainstream bitcoin adoption. I think he deserves the seat. He has put millions into dozens of diverse startups. All the child porn stuff is not directly connected to him at all. He was underage himself during the time period of one of the earlier incidents.
I also spoke with him face to face for about 5 minutes after he got off stage. He was friendly and very easy to approach. One thing we spoke about was how he was the one who went to Wedbush Securites and persuaded them to really investigate bitcoin.

Just because they're vocal doesn't mean they're informed. When I say informed I'm talking about the people who've gone to countless meetups and have done hundreds of hours of due diligence like I have. Maybe informed wasn't the best choice of words, but just lurking this subreddit doesn't fall under my definition of informed bitcoin trader.

I'm an options trader and have worked on Wall Street before so I like to think I know the stock market pretty well at this point. There's an incredible amount of manipulation and bubbles in the stock market every single day. I gave GoPro as one example and I could give a bunch of others.
I watch the markets very closely and I'd even go as far as to say the stock market as a whole is incredibly over valued right now. There are many indicators that are signalling this, but one I like to follow the most is put/call ratio. The high put to call ratio I've consistently seen in the S&amp;P over the past few months (essentially over 2.0 everyday since I've been watching meticulously) tells me that stocks like GoPro are bubbles and IPOs like Alibaba are just ways to make a quick buck(I like Alibaba as a company but the stock could go down 5-10% any day because a lot of that money in there is just fluff waiting for profits to be taken)
Getting a little off topic but my point is a 5% sell off in Alibaba is a loss of $10 billion dollars in market cap. Once you can, for instance, sell some Alibaba and throw it into bitcoin all in 2 minutes, there's a lot of room for bitcoin to run. If $10 billion can aimlessly pour into GoPro or $20 billion into Twitter before it ever even had an earnings report then I can easily see $5-10 billion pour into a Bitcoin ETF because bitcoin holds a lot more promise than a camera on a stick.
@_date: 2014-10-05 01:44:01
I'm not necessarily saying the actual product is bad or useless, I'm saying the the amount of money currently flowing into the stock isn't justified. GoPro has only had one earnings report as a public company and while it did marginally beat expectations I don't think it warrants a doubling of the stock by any means. It technically lost $19.9 million last quarter and both revenue and net income are down from the same time in 2013. Early in the trading day last Thursday it was down 12% from its $92 dollar high on some slightly negative news. One bad report and this stock can be down 20% easily. It's a nifty product, but they really aren't doing anything revolutionary and I don't see explosive growth in the near term to justify this out of control run up.
@_date: 2014-04-09 03:03:22
there are literally billions of people on the planet who don't have access to a bank account. The growth is not just going to come from people speculating on price increases but also from people from places like Argentina who can't trust their local bank or their currency. Here's a good video of Xapo CEO talking about it: 
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:55:30
I was thinking the same thing. So maybe it's the twins themselves using their 1% or someone helping them? The last thing the twins want is the ETF underperforming right after it's launched so having the price low will likely result in positive headlines about this being one of the best performing ETFs available.

when I bought my ethereum at the 2000 for 1 bitcoin ratio I was paying about 30 cents per ether. How much do you value the "fuel" for a smart contract to be worth? 
Maybe I misunderstand how the contracts will work but lets say I'm using a marriage contract to get married and it costs a few ether to run. That seems like a pretty good deal to get legally married over paying hundreds of dollars for a lawyer using todays process.

It seems like Elon just hasn't researched it deeply enough to understand its real potential. Considering he was one of the early founders of PayPal, I think once he does, he'll be much more enthusiastic about it and not be talking about the nefarious use cases. 
Maybe we can suggest someway Tesla or SolarCity could use micropayments to help further their adoption? Or just ask if he's researched it any further and changed his stance on cryptocurrencies.

Hate was probably too strong of a word for the title. She strongly dislikes it. 
But not nearly as much since we've started having frequent conversations about it :)
I've been finding that if you can get across to the person in a calm, logical way that this really is a legitimate computer science breakthrough and a new *technology*, not just a volatile currency, they tend to slowly change their tone. 
It won't happen after the first time you bring it up, but if you space it out and bring it up a few times in a non aggressive manner and give them time to digest it, most friends of mine have come to see past the negative headlines. They end up doing their own research and realizing it's actually pretty revolutionary to own your own money. 
It doesn't show from this one short teasing email, but that's the approach I took at first and she's starting to slowly get more curious and interested with it. She was even the one who brought it up the last time we went out to dinner.

Yesterday was pretty packed as far as all the seats being filled and 10-20 people also standing in the back. I didn't mind it being less crowded today. I got to personally chat with many bitcoin celebs and have engaging conversations.
I did yesterday too, and there were more of them, but it was more a swarm of people all trying to talk with Brock or Barry and you got a quick 30 seconds where as today was a bit more private and rewarding. Personal fav talks were Barry, Brock, Airbitz's Paul Puey, Trace Meyer, Dan Morehead, and Perianne. 
Networking pass was free and sneaking into the non-free talks was mostly easy. Very much worth going. Would have probably sold out if the price was higher

"Although the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change, the Commission
emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain
technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment. Rather, the
Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed in detail below,
BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to
demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section
6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that its rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and
manipulative acts and practices"

Thanks, you sound like a great guy yourself
I figured that because I had to first transfer the money from my checking to my small business that it wasn't possible online. I consider myself a techie but tbh I've only ever needed to do large wires like this a handful of times so I never really tried doing it online and didn't realize it was possible with 2 different banks in different states. 
Despite my ignorance (assuming it's possible to transfer money online with TD) there are millions of older people who don't know how to bank online and unfortunately probably never will learn so even if I start doing mine online it's still a problem for many others. 
Either the big banks need to make an intuitive enough smartphone/tablet app that even my 60 year old dad can easily use to make transfers or he'll forever be at the bank 25 minutes longer than he needs to be waiting for Janet to reboot the system

We both have finance backgrounds so we're always talking about the stock market and financial system in general when we're together. Our relationship is actually pretty good (we're neighbors and have dinner once a month) so the bitcoin related emails are more of tease than anything hurtful to her occupation. They're not always exclusively about bitcoin and even when they are she's not offended by them.
I've explained how bitcoin works and the technology behind it many times. She's actually coming around lately. We agree on a lot of things like the US equities market being overvalued and the banking system being antiquated and in need of major improvements. 
The main thing she can't get past is the negative connotations it has - being used to buy drugs and launder money. She still doesn't think it will ever being used in a significant percentage of transactions, (not even 1% in 10 years) but after all our talks and emails she's starting to see some potenital value in it.
