Yes, the ones who know english have no problem googling and finding contents online. In Portuguese I didn't found any with the depth that bit-coin.pt has (and it intends to have in the future).

I can't ee the "high volume" in btc-china: 
 
Versus Houbi: 
Using the 1hour timeframe, isn't Houbi with higher volume than Btc-china? I'm I missing something when you say what you say?

Not quite... Bitcoin is still very slow...
Bitcoin = 10 minutes 
VeriCoin = Less than 1 minute
Big difference!
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:38:12
Vericoin does this faster (in seconds/1minute) with VeriSend: see 
And also VeriCoin can be used everywhere Bitcoin is accepted using VeriBit, see this:

Houbi - Chinese on the move!
Kraken - Nice volume, best day so far! Congrats!

Update on my prediction.. Going like ClockWork.... where are you  ?

Here's the direct link: 
I'm not saying it's gonna happen but it could probably happen.
This is a simple exercise I did and it's regarding the price progression, the Highs and Lows for RSI; what happened in the past, what has happened again. And taking into account that events have happened the same way over and over, leads me to assume that price could probably follow the same progression as before.
Note: This is not a fact, this is 100% speculative and it's my opinion and read about the bitcoin price flow and near future.

So guess my 90% prediction isn't that far off looking at today's charts right? ... Today or tomorrow we will see a considerable price fall.

Give it some time, then come back and let's see who's laughing then ;) deal?
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:42:31
Yes, sure... I still leave that 10% for a possible uptrend without going down to test the 5000$ price pivot point... but I as things look, it's not that probable... 10%.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:19:47
I did go up after my post yes, but now is going to go down... just watch it...  Price reached the top of this little push, TK touch and will start going down ...

To make it clear, I said "90%" to avoid saying "Bitcoin IS going down"... This was my way of saying that I strongly feel that Bitcoin is going down because the Ichimoku clouds are pointing exactly to that! Price is far away from TK line and from the clouds, like a magnet it will eventually be pulled down.
