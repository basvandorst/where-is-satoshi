Err, text messaging?

So you're telling me a bunch of people that can hardly find food are going to be throwing around Bitcoins with their non-existant smartphones?

Silicon valley obviously doesn't realize who is funding their little startups...

Good, I hope your bitcoins get stolen if you're stupid enough to click this

McAfee would be more of an asset to the Libertarian party and Bitcoin if he wasn't loaded 24/7

I don't understand what was achieved here
@_date: 2016-04-03 12:36:07
I'm curious if this will get any traction, I have my doubts though
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:39:55
Oh yeah, like anyone wants to trust the fuckhead who started craptsy again

I think there is SOME validity to the pessimism presented in this article... Sure, the things about books and newspapers was a bit off - but the idea that the internet is slowly isolating us instead of connecting us is something real. I think the real value of this article and discussing it is understanding that there are some implications of certain technology that are difficult to overcome.

The internet as we know it has been around for 25 years, commercial electricity for a little over 100, money for thousands. Bitcoin is a TYPE of money, and the internet is a TYPE of computer network. For example - we don't use the ARPANET in 2015. It was a stepping stone. Just like the internet, just like Bitcoin. It lives, it dies, it gets replaced.

Bitcoin is dead guys, just sell em off and go home. I'll buy them, don't worry.

I find it pretty hard to believe a cop would harass you about a stupid little thing that looks like a life alert. OP needs to stop contributing to this stupid circle jerk

Xapo is a scam operation. Coinbase is a decent option or trezor

Oh god, not another one of these threads.... My philosophy: it ain't an investment, it's not going to go back to a volatile stock-like cash cow, it's not something you 'sell' or 'hold'. 
You buy bitcoin when you want to either store value for an extended period of time - regardless of price. OR you buy it when you want to exercise the exclusive, unique financial freedom it offers. 
I'm an early adopter and I still prefer to pay for my coffee with dollars. However there is no way in hell I'm paying western union 5 bucks to send 50. 
The dollar is inevitably going to encounter some severe problems, but it is okay for most use cases in my eyes. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:40:23
I thought exactly the same thing haha. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 15:11:20
Money is money, bitcoin is money. Someday in the future bitcoin will be abandoned in the same way we are abandoning fiat. It's not magic like all these guys play it out to be.

I live fucking life. Then someday, I'll die. 
No matter how many sats you stack, you'll unfortunately never own a main belt asteroid like me. I am 1/700,000 and that asteroid compared to NASA's 16-Psyche appraisal is, well, large. You could offer me Satoshi's wallet in 2050 for my 6km solid Iron / Nickel asteroid and I would laugh in your face because the sum would be so paltry.
Live your life man, you'll be rotting in the ground soon enough and probably forget to share your private keys with anyone meaningful.

I don't understand why people in the bitcoin community equate a global financial crisis to an instant correlation to greater valuation of bitcoin. In all likelihood it would ramp the value of gold up first (its physical, tangible, etc.) Then as the dust settles and online infrastructure regains people's confidence - you could see mass adoption of something like bitcoin. I really think the bitcoin economy is kinda shot currently from all the early pump and dumps as well as drug trade. The block size debate has pushed us to complacency as well.

Tell this to Mark Karpeles. He became a billionaire off of bitcoins that really never existed.

I'd just torch the machine and laugh with a gang of regulators.
