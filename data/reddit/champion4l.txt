They are the largest retail store exchange. You buy over the counter. Like BTMs, but far more locations (thousands) and cheaper. I visited their South Station BTM (first in the country) when they were called Liberty Teller.

LibertyX did segwit early

Don't take my word for it
Try it yourself

You could open a channel with a very low fee if you knew you wanted to hop on the lightning network in advance
edit: fixed typo
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:43:37
Good answer
At what fee level do transactions never confirm / get kicked back? I know it varies, but as a general rule.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:54:56
if you have a lot of dust lightning payments, will it ever be possible to post those to the main chain?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:16:12
Segwit / batched / priority options?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:54:11
Correct. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:32:20
yeah but draper bought those coins and reinvested in the ecosystem
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:00:15
Take your own word for it.
Try it out.

Bitcoin is a religion to many just like the USD
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:40:41
Jesus those are some truth bombs
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:10:39
That's satoshis not USD. I'm talking USD.

It does require segwit.
Bcash is a short-term pump &amp; dump. 
Roger Ver just found a Mario coin box and is punching it until it runs out of coins.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:24:50
LibertyX does segwit
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:04:53
Segwit is only overhyped in that it's being adopted slowly.
It really does reduce fees, a lot.
Hopefully it being part of an upcoming bitcoin core release will help.

YOU CAN'T TRADE BITCOIN WITH A TD BANK ACCOUNT...
....TD Ameritrade trades bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:39:12
LibertyX.com can go on the exchange list
They were one of the first per the last thread
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:01:56
The corruption is so shameless that you almost have to respect it
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:13
Yeah, but what happens when Fred wants his 0.0001 BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:05:08
maybe 50% of his risk (volatility)
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:05:57
LibertyX has segwit
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:47:35
LibertyX uses segwit
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:25:38
Something else to check is do they charge users for miner fees. This prevents them from subsidizing spam attacks.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:08:04
Australia adds subsidy for bitcoin starting July of 2019

NIRP (negative interest rate policy) doesn't work if cash is legal. It starts a run on the banks.
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:59:33
risky click
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:09:46
I guess you could skip the trezor step and send right to the exchange since it will not be on their long? They might be a little alarmed seeing that from a new account though.
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:46:33
Pretty sure you don't need a machine so it's free money dude
