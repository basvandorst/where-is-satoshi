first of all! I have not made any mistakes! My only mistake was to create an account in poloniex, to put bitcoins and to do traiding! After a few days they locked my account, without any warning!
thx for your words!

So, the best thing I can do is tell other people not to create an account in poloniex because they close their accounts arbitrarily without solution or notice! And when you accept your terms, can they abuse, close, steal what they want because there are no regulations on it?

Hello, my account has been locked! I do not know why this happened, I would like to have a quick solution, sometimes I connect to the internet through my vpn service for greater security! Maybe you are blocking access from vpn, I do not know! I in my account had balance in etherium and bitcoin plus! I expect a prompt solution to this, and if you can tell me why my account has been blocked, so that in the future I will not happen again! I'm sorry for my English! It is not my native language. My poloniex account is verified! regards my Support ticket

The problem here is not that I should stop buying and selling cryptocoins, the big problem is that poloniex is locking accounts without telling us anything! And that makes us lose money! That they are rich does not give them the right to do what they want!
I'm very upset about abuse! I have little money in that account, but as I see that there are many people with their account locked! I just try to do something for myself and for everyone!

I have a lawyer friend who works in the United States! I told him about the problem that many poloniex users are including myself, and he told me that he could review the case and see the legal aspects of the matter!
We can raise funds with all the users that have been affected that according to I see are many!
If they do not solve the problems in a short time, it is money that we lose !! Because we create a poloniex account to make money by doing traiding and if they block your account, you can lose all your money because of the volatility of the market!
No one will compensate us for that loss!
