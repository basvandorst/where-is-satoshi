Wanted to hop on the top comment to also ask people to please spin up a full core node if you haven't already done so. It takes ~150gb of disk space and 4-7 days to sync.
Evidently one of Core's primary concerns with increasing blocksize is that the syncing time will grow exponentially, and it will discourage people running nodes, thereby decreasing decentralization.
If we can get enough nodes up and running and prove that how long it takes to sync a node isn't a factor in whether people will run one or not, Core might consider raising blocksize in addition to the Segwit and Lightning improvements. (Note: Core hasn't said anything to me that they would ever consider raising blocksize, I'm just speculating based on a couple twitter interactions I've had).  
Edit: Here are a few links for those that may be interested:

I am pro Core because they’re the best developers and are first and foremost concerned with network security/decentralization, which is how it should be. 
I personally am also in favor increasing blocksize but Core is concerned that bigger blocks would mean fewer nodes/more centralization due to the increased sync time. I️ have no clue if Core would increase blocksize if we increase nodes, but I suspect it would help our case and it’s good for network security anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:52:46
I was tweeting with Luke Jr. last night - he's still concerned that we don't have enough nodes up in enough jurisdictions. If you haven't already, spin up a core node and get it synced. 
I'll bet if there are enough independent nodes in enough locations around the world the Core developers will consider increasing blocksize.
Core, or at least Luke Jr., is concerned that the node takes too long to sync and it discourages people from running nodes, that's why they haven't increased blocksize.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:54:43
I don't think it's possible for Coinbase to do Segwit right now given their UTXO problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:00:17
No it doesn’t. My theory is that if Core Developers felt comfortable that there were sufficient extant nodes, they may feel comfortable increasing blocksize even though it would increase sync time. 
For example: If there are 10,000 nodes at 1mb blocksize and core estimates that increasing blocksize to 2mb will reduce nodes to 5,000, they won’t increase. 
But if there are 100,000 nodes at 1mb blocksize, Core may feel OK with increasing blocksize because it would reduce nodes to 50,000, which they feel is an acceptable level of decentralization.

My Windows 10 did this automatically for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:27:17
As I said in my comment - Core doesn’t think that bandwidth or storage is the issue. They are concerned that nodes take too long to sync as is, and syncing will get even longer with larger blocks, so fewer people will run nodes, so the network will become more centralized.

OK but won't fees for ordinary transactions conducted in Bitcoin (ie transactions comparable to an ATM withdrawal) also be $2-$5 unless some protocol alleviates the pressure when blocks get full?  
I really thought that negligible fee transactions was what made Bitcoin so compelling - ex. merchants would love to cut credit card companies out of transaction process - but it sounds like that's just not the way Bitcoin is heading unfortunately.

Many landlords that include utilities in their rentals have "excessive use" clauses in the leases specifically to prevent stuff like this.  I don't know whether AirBNB has such a clause for owners that list through their site but I would assume they do.  
Using a USB miner doesn't pull enough juice to worry about but setting up a few PSUs and ASICs for a week or two certainly would be in violation of the lease.

@_date: 2017-08-22 15:29:30
Thank you - that's an answer I think makes sense as to why bigger blocks isn't necessarily the solution.  
Plus, if you have 10x users and the price is 10x, transactions will cost 10x. 
Radically bigger blocks seem unrealistic at this point to me so maybe BCH is going to crash unless storage gets cheaper and faster. 
It'd be interesting if some of these decentralized storage networks could be used as nodes - like a bunch of Sia nodes.

The way I read it they'll just stop transferring dollars to American bank accounts.  You can still trade in and out of USDT (tether) and other cryptos and will be able to transfer BTC and other crypto to whichever wallet you want.  
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:55:02
Thanks for response. 
Presumably the BCH miners and nodes are prepared to scale to whatever the block size needs to be, right?  And in the future, when 256mb blocks are necessary, presumably computing power and storage will be inexpensive enough that running a full node is possible for an average user. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:14:29

Curious why you say that Bitcoin Cash, which seems to have solved the particular scaling problem you mention, doesn't have long-term prospects?

So if Google fiber becomes widely available having large blocks won't be an issue?
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:53:46
You're right about that but it certainly seems like the miners/nodes operating Bitcoin Cash will simply adopt larger blocks. As computing power and storage increase the cost of operating a full node would sort of even out - that is to say, with current tech, yes running a full node with 256mb blocks is inconceivably expensive, but by the time they're needed, presumably power and storage space will be relatively inexpensive, right?

I get the sense that some people don't understand what ETFs are...
The stocks and bonds these ETFs are investing in are regulated by the SEC, with reporting standards and manipulating equities is criminal.  Bitcoin does not have the same reporting standards nor is it criminal to manipulate (or easy to successfully prosecute such manipulation).
It wasn't the ETF part that the SEC denied.  It was the Bitcoin part.  
You can create an ETF and call it the "Lite_Coin_Guy" ETF and as long as you have the appropriate licenses, disclosures, and invest in securities that are already established and subject to the same regulations as other securities traded on the major exchanges it would likely be approved.  
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:51:26
I don't understand your point then. Your first post implies that a 6000% increase isn't a big deal because the price only increased to $0.94 per gallon, which you think is cheap.

I just have a hard time accepting this argument - we should want fees to be lower than credit card/PayPal fees if we're really talking about Bitcoin specifically as the technology that upend quite a lot of the economy.
The blockchain is revolutionary, for sure, I just want to be sure that it's Bitcoin that people think of when they think of the blockchain (yes, brand name is nice to have), but ease of use ought to ultimately be the driver of price.  
Roger Ver is a thin-skinned man that essentially won the Powerball and now acts like he's Bitcoin god, but he is right that sometimes the network is slow and fees are too high ie the User Experience is not good. 
IMO we should want fees to be as close to 0 as possible.

Not at the funds they're employed at now. 
1) the people that invested in whatever fund didn't sign up to invest in cryptocurrency - they were pitched on a business plan, and sent their money to be invested in a particular asset class or style of management. Going so far outside that plan could be mismanagement of funds and you would probably wind up in jail. 
2) Investing other people's money (OPM) is very highly regulated and if a trader were to go rogue and keep investors' funds on an exchange that's not in the US or subject to US securities laws they'd be locked up. 
3) taking a proposal to investment committee and saying you want to invest x million in shitcoin xyz because they've got a new idea that might be worth something someday would get shot down hard.  It's simply too Wild West right now and there are no comparable investments that would enable you to present a deal coherently. 
I would expect to see exclusively cryptocurrency investment funds started in the near future. They will not be based in New York though - more likely Caymans - and the operators probably will not be able to be American Citizens, which will scare lots of people and cut off the largest capital market in the world (America) from investing. 
It's funny, but for institutional money to flow into crypto and really blow the top off - to get to the moon - we need regulation so that the money can come into the space.

Assuming you're not being sarcastic: These are smart people that actually understand the technology part of Bitcoin and altcoins relatively well. It's as much a part of daily discussion as what the 10yr treasury yields are or what the jobs numbers are going to look like. 
It's talked about at work, at dinners, parties, etc. Mostly people talking about good trades they made or which shitcoin is pre-pump and ready to go. 
One important thing to note: Almost none of these people are trading crypto for the investment funds they work for. They are all doing this on their own with their own capital.  That is to say - actual institutional money isn't in crypto yet, at least not on a large scale. But the people who work at the institutions are wildly interested in it and invested in it. 
If crypto really takes off the beneficiaries are going to be tech savvy people and finance professionals. Finance professionals have the capital and trading crypto aligns with their expertise in financial analysis fairly well. 
I'd say that the finance industry is disproportionately represented in ownership. Techies and finance bros own a lot of the crypto that's out there.

I agree you can invest in both, and I do, since I believe that the smart contract feature for Bitcoin is quite a ways off yet.
However, the Bitcoin Core dev team is very, very, very good. The ETH team is also very, very good. 
ETH has its own drama and is more likely to catch banhammers from financial regulators because of all the scamcoins being created. Bitcoin doesn't yet have to deal with that.
The goal is to get Bitcoin integrated into society so it can't be banned, and then unveil these features like anon tx and smart contracts.
Ethereum has at least as much political drama going on - and by the way, how many forks has ETH had?

I genuinely believed in the big block thing before the fork because fees *were* high and it was getting slow and I didn't understand how Bitcoin was going to be a universal payment system.  Only provided an coherent answer to my questions about how Bitcoin was meant to scale to compete with Visa one day - big blocks to keep fees low.  I also read Core supporters saying that high fees were good for decentralization and that Bitcoin should be digital gold/store of wealth. That's not what I wanted Bitcoin to be.  
But now I see why the debate devolved to the point where Core people stopped even trying to answer questions - because the forkers were not acting in good faith. They pretended to be all about scaling and the future and the "user experience" but all they wanted to do was unseat Core.  They were spamming transactions to fill up the mempool and drive up fees. The people realized this and just stopped arguing. I sent a $288 transaction for $0.05 the other day and it took less than an hour to go through. 
Well, fool me once, forkers.   
It's become clear to me that the developers at Core will increase blocksize when it becomes necessary and that having better developers is better than having a bunch of mining farms/hashpower.

I believe the blockchain is a very interesting technology that could change the way payments are made, and I think Bitcoin is the brand-name of blockchain currency/crypto.  
Long term, I think it could be a good investment, but I just hope people understand that this is euphoria and we are likely in a bubble right now. It may very well continue, but there will be a price correction at some point, as there always is.

People - there is going to be a price correction. An epic one that's going to make a lot of people feel bad. We are not going straight up. 
All this euphoria is ridiculous. 
When the bubble pops, first we are going to see many "HODL!!" memes. Then when the price is 1/2 or 1/3 or 1/5th of what it is today we are going to see "Why I'm still buying Bitcoin" and "Why I still believe in Bitcoin" memes.  
Stop with this craziness. It will just make you sadder when the reckoning comes. And it IS going to come.
I think Bitcoin is very interesting technology, but you have to admit that it's no longer true that the least interesting thing about Bitcoin is its price. Right now, its price seems to be the most interesting thing.  
I can't pick tops or bottoms so I'm forced to HODL, but the price correction - when it comes (not if, when) - is going to be *very* hard to watch.
Also - THE END IS NEAR! (I just reread my comment and I sound like an end of the world nutter. I'm just trying to get people to remain calm and not get cocky, because the price is going to come down, probably significantly, before it goes back up again.)

I will be fair and say that the FCC always had the authority to regulate the Internet as a "communications device", but they explicitly decided not to regulate it. 
The policy of purposely avoiding regulation, even though the FCC has the authority, was better than Net Neutrality.  Now the FCC is (after the lawsuits conclude and it becomes official policy) going to be focusing on the Internet, and things that went previously unnoticed will now have a spotlight on them. 
I cannot understand why Reddit and Ars Technica wanted Net Neutrality so badly. If I were a conspiracy theorist I'd say online comment/editorial support was at least partially astroturfed by someone with a vested interest in regulating the Internet.

Theoretically you would have dollars invested in a portfolio that at least matched inflation.

I don't want to get into a whole thing here but...and by the way this whole thing is very complicated and I'm taking limited examples in a complex system.  
1) This is a chart of the dollar index which is vs foreign currencies.  Unless you're taking a vacation in Europe or Japan this isn't really important.  
The two ways it could be important is if a retailer or manufacturer that imports goods or parts from another country has to increase his prices due to the cheaper dollar relative to that country's currency, but it's likely that the producer or retailer will simply purchase their widgets from a country where the exchange rate is more favorable, possibly even America.  A weak dollar is generally good for certain sectors (mining, manufacturing inc high tech manufacturing, etc) of the American economy overall.
The second thing a weak dollar relative to other currencies means is that stuff in America is cheaper to people in other countries.  So in addition to the benefit to manufacturing jobs, it also means that Chinese are laundering their money buying houses in Seattle (driving prices up, but guess what - they can't take that real estate back to China; like the Japanese and Rock Center in the 80s - sell it to them at a 2% cap, buy it back at a 10% cap) and Eurocrats are spending money in cities like NYC, DC, San Francisco, LA, and other destination cities...for the rest of America, the dollar index doesn't really change things.  It's not like China's out there buying so much cheap American milk that the price is going up.  
The relevant metric that matters to most Americans isn't the dollar index, it's inflation: Goods that you use every day that cost more each day/week/year.  Milk, gas, beef, bacon, etc.  
Money supply growth that generally matches population growth is a relatively stable policy - more people each consuming and producing an equivalently increasing amount of stuff, you need to add more dollars to the equation or else prices are going to go up as relatively fewer dollars chase more goods.
Stable population growth and stable money supply growth erode the purchasing power of the dollar at a stable rate, which, in theory, would raise wages at the same rate.  
Obviously not all of that, especially the wage increases, is happening as fast as some people would like to see - we added a ton of money to the system during TARP and ZIRP but so far it's only inflated asset prices.  The next leg could be wage increases.  If they did it right.
In case they didn't, there's Bitcoin.  
TLDR - dollar index isn't the relevant metric for American Bitcoin holders.

Thanks very much for putting this into a framework I can understand. 
Can I ask for more direction?  So my coins are in my electrum wallet: My "private key" is the thing that looks like a gpg key, correct?  I also have a seed of 12 words. 
I would need to import both of those to an electrum fork wallet - "electrum BCC wallet" or similar to have coins on the BCC chain also. 
Do I have that right?

I don't think that's right. You need to be in a wallet where you control private key before July 31 8pm east coast time (midnight August 1 UTC). 
Coinbase has specifically said they won't support BCC. 
If anyone has link where they reversed that decision please post. I won't be able to withdraw all my coins by that date due to their ridiculous $10,000/day limit and will still have 10+ BTC in the exchange at that date. 
They have fiduciary duty to their customers - not providing support for BCC is negligent.  I'm sure they have more expensive lawyers than me, but I'll file for damages and waste some of my money (and theirs) out of spite for their awful customer service.

Relatively cheaper USD means it's relatively cheaper to buy goods from the US.  That means Mercedes would buy parts from Detroit because they can get a deal, or that EUcrats will buy natgas from the US producers rather than Russia because it's relatively cheaper.

As I said in my comment above - having the hashpower in Shenzhen controlled by Jihan isn't an ideal situation that may not have been fully detailed in the whitepaper. 
That doesn't make the whitepaper obsolete. 
The Founders didn't know about the internet, but they laid the framework for being able to deal with a world-changing technology. 
I wouldn't be so quick to declare Satoshi obsolete just because we don't like Jihan and the fact that he's cheating/centralizing hashpower.  There will be unintended consequences.

Nothing, you just won't get the BCC that is forking off from BTC on August 1 (UTC). 
If you have your coins in a paper wallet prior to the fork, you will have coins on both chains. Presumably, the price will drop for one or both coins e.g. if one coin is worth $2,000 and it splits into two coins, each one is worth $1,000. 
It won't work like that, of course, BTC will likely be more valuable than BCC (futures markets say BCC is $250-$300) but there's a chance that it could be worth more. Also, even if it's only worth $250, that would probably strip $250 of value from the BTC.

Hobby mining has always been profitable as long as the price is increasing.  But as Amichateur says...you'd be better off if you just kept the bitcoins you're about to send to Bitmain.  
Trust me - I'm "profitable" on a $9,000 setup that runs 54th/s at my out of town house set up in Feb 17, but if I had just kept the 7-8BTC I sent to Bitmain, I'd have made $10,000 already rather than just having broken even earlier this summer, even given the ridiculous price increases.

Well, gee, what an excellent reddit post that was to read!  
We should base a new currency around a reddit post that's disseminated by an asshole that says things like, "do be careful referencing obsolete documentation".  Throw that old, outdated Satoshi whitepaper out the window!  
Terribly sorry guv', but there's nothing in that post that changes the design of Bitcoin. It's designed the way it is. If you don't have the hashpower to validate the blockchain on your node and your blockchain differs from a blockchain with the hashpower to validate theirs, technically *you* are the attacking node.

It's not as efficient as mining directly, of course.  But I don't have the time or space to set up a Dash mining rig. Furthermore, with my 2 year contract and expected difficulty increases, I think I will get more Dash than I would have buying it when the price was .08 BTC/DSH when BTC was $2600 - $2600 i.e. 1 BTC would've gotten me 12.5 Dash. 
A 2 year contract for 500mh/s is $2250. Using an online calculator you get 15 Dash per year at current diff. Simplifying things, assuming difficulty doubles you get 7.5 Dash per year/ or 15 for the contract. So far payouts have been consistent with getting 15 per year so it's possible I will get much more Dash than if I'd just bought it with $2600/1 BTC. 
It depends when you buy the contract, how much difficulty increases etc. 
It's not a scam, it's not always the most efficient, but it's not a scam. I actually believe I'll come out ahead on my contract and will get more than 12.5 Dash at the end of 2 years.

Maybe - but eroding trust like that would make a hard fork where the minercoin becomes the "most trusted" coin more difficult. 
Say miners pull support from 91. People are pissed but miners control the chain. So core says, "see, what did we tell you." And people line up behind core. Core forces a chain split. 
Who is going to want to be on the minercoin chain that can't be trusted vs the core chain that hasn't broken that trust (yet).

That is how the whitepaper is written. The hashpower determines the chain. 
I get it - having hashpower centralized in Shenzhen and controlled by Jihan is not good for bitcoin long term. I even partially agree with the solutions proposed i.e. Forking the network if necessary. 
But the original whitepaper describes the solution to defeating an attacking node by out hashing it.
