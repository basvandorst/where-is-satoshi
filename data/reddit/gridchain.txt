No data on the drive as I mentioned it was professionally investigated at a deep level and the intruders managed to securely erase all the important logs.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:39:21
That's correct
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:43:04
That's what they wanted to let us know... or let us believe.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:27:53
You misunderstood, or I didn't explain it clearly. The BTC were on a blockchain.info online wallet. A session with the wallet was opened on a given computer's browser but was left open (i.e. didn't logout from blockchain.info) by mistake and only MacOS's session was closed leaving the computer on. Since we know nobody got physical access to the machine and that said machine had VNC exposed to the Internet, it's a matter of 1+1 that it went this way.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:21:20
Good point.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:06:04
Yes they even have a pretty nice Facebook and Twitter page but obviously I got no reply. But who knows, maybe it's a false flag? Could be anything.
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:32:12
Thanks a lot I really hope so!

I don't think so, if you look at the tx, a fair amount of BTC was moved, so you are either a BTC billionaire faking JoinMarket's mixing service, or you are just plainly using JoinMarket.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:31:33
There are a few of them but I'm not sure their claims are legit
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:33:28
Interesting, how can you tell?
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:59:09
Yes, there are also other hints at the fact the are pretty newbie. For example, they first "tried" to mix the wallet with 45 BTC leaving the other untouched. A few days later, they mixed the other 400 BTC. Looks like it was their first attempt so they first tried with a smaller amount just to make sure the mixer was working well.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:30:26
This is interesting, at least it is if the Moroccan group was really behind it. We are currently trying to trace the btc transactions but they went through a bitcoin mixer and unless somebody with an incredible knowledge of bitcoin forensics comes out on rescue, there is right now no way to know where these btc went.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:20:27
Told already, investigation didn't go anywere because the coins were sitting still for 1.5 years. Now they have been finally moved but authorities are soooo slow to investigate the matter and we are afraid hot traces will vanish soon, so we decided to additionally seek external help, even if that means we'll have to give up 50% of the coins it's still better than nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:47:23
Attacker bruteforced a VNC password NATted on a public IP, got access to the MacOS computer where the browser still had the session open with Blockchain.info's wallet where the BTC were stored, as we forgot to logout before leaving the desk. No 2FA or logs were enabled on blockchain.info's wallet at that time. On the corporate firewall, logs were cleaned (keychain had stored the firewall password too), on the Mac all logs were securely deleted, no traces whatsoever were left after investigation with traditional forensic tools.
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:11:58
Sure we can point the finger to at least 3 extremely stupid choices.
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:02:37
Who said we did let this go? The police is still investigating but they didn't find anything yet, that's why we came up with this desperate bounty offer... 1.5 years later...
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:04:43
As I mentioned in the post there are no logs, they deleted everything
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:07:33
No as I said the disk was analysed by trained forensics and it came out that logs were securely deleted i.e. overwritten with zeros before being deleted, after that the Mac was shut down just to make sure everything that was left in the RAM got lost too.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:47:10
On blockchain.info's wallet, the bitcoins aren't actually sitting on their website. But I got the point.
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:35:21
Admin pass = vnc pass on that particular Mac
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:17:25
I'm afraid that it was actually a pretty simple one and yes, bruteforceable. It wasn't meant to be a computer with a permanent wallet on it with that huge amount of bitcoins. A session with blockchain was opened there and was by error left open without logging out.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:47:54
Good question but unfortunately no answer till now, at least nothing has been found in that sense.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:21:00
Nope it was the russian intelligence that made it for him
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:16:24
This sounds too good to be true, please provide some kind of proof of what you are talking about, also we won't provide more than 50% as this is a HUGE bounty already.
Unless you are personally the one that took the coins and is able to return them to us directly, any information you will provide us will need the help of the relevat authorities to be enforced which means additional costs and 50% is the maximum we are willing to give.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:33:40
Lol no it doesn't work this way. If somehow we get tangible proof of where the coins went AFTER being mixed, we can provide this information to the ongoing investigation and they will the enforce legal actions (i.e. Getting search warrants, raiding at those people's homes, etc). Right now investigations are stuck hence this post.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:38:49
Yes we would accept that and ask the authorities to drop all criminal charges against them if they return the 50%
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:10:14
This is actually a great idea thanks we'll look into that
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:57:19
No incentive? What other job can give you 222.5 BTC worth of clean and lawfully earned money in maybe a few hours or days, I'm wondering? If you're not Warren Buffet of course.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:34:00
Yes, actually totally dumb, but unfortunately it went that way
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:53:36




Are these mixes that you have logged of any use to find the output address where the "cleaned" BTC were sent to?
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:06:24
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:02:19
We suppose it was bruteforced but in fact may have been exploited too. We don't know. What we know for sure is that the thieves didn't have physical access to the machine because it was locked down in our office. It was MacOS's 10.11 builtin VNC server (screen sharing).
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:31:08
MacOS 10.11
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:44:24
We digested the loss already several months ago that's why.
