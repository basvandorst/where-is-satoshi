I wish I could deposit BTC to my credit card too...
@_date: 2015-06-11 03:36:25
What are you trying to do? Actually mine with the switches stock OS? Or use them to connect your miners to?
@_date: 2015-06-11 03:39:06
So you have asics then?
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:33:13
Last I checked, you could still buy bundles with BTC but not from the store.
@_date: 2015-06-11 03:53:17
If you want to mine from your switches. You will have to CPU mine. This means you will have to compile from source since no pre-compiled mining software exists for any switches OS. 
If you build your own rig to CPU mine with the most badass cpu in the world.... Right now, you would be lucky to make 5 cents a month. This is what you need to make a profit. And still it is a gamble.

This will be way faster than downloading the entire blockchain through the qt wallet.

I bought an amazon card once and exchanged the rest for btc
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:46:42
hmm, I was reading the TOS and there's a fee of 0.12% per year for their vault. So I assume you'd load up your BTC to the vault and that would be your available balance. Just guessing here.

You realize you just posted this exact same thing right?
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:48:32
I believe that they will never overtake BTC. I do think dogecoin has brought many people to the world of crypto though, thanks to the light hearted shibes over in They seem to be very adamant about their coin. Hell I've even read a thread that a person was recruiting a bunch of people on that sub to do door-to-door DOGE sales. Gotta love their enthusiasm. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 22:33:20
Bought one for $175 with no issues. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 02:33:09
If you have a Google voice number that'll work too for the 2fa texts. Probably not the most secure solution but it'll work. Make sure you have 2fa on your email too.
@_date: 2014-06-21 00:05:52
They sent me a second response stating that amazon is back. Hmmm, must be focusing more on their customer support... Actually responding to requests.
@_date: 2014-10-02 03:02:52
If you're on a windows 8 laptop and can't boot you probably have to turn off uefi, sometimes called secure boot, in you're bios. It may say something like enable bios or secure boot. Or enable bios 1st and secure boot 2nd. Bios is what you want.

hmm. Don't think so. my BTC address doesn't even contain one 6. 
Good try ;)
@_date: 2014-08-02 04:13:57
No its actually a just a cover-your-ass kind of thing on their end. They verify your card by making 2 small payments. You log into your cards website an input the 2 charge amounts on cryptsy. I think each charge is under a buck 50. Those 2 charges will be voided. Now if you don't have enough funds in your checking they'll just bill your card instead which is how they can then send it instantly.
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:38:01
Ok, you use Mycelium. Now how the hell do you copy your receiving address from within the app? For the life of me I can't figure it out. Long-pressing anywhere within the app doesn't seem to work. (I'm sure I'm doing something wrong or overlooking something)

Looks like it's gone... I can't find it either.
At least there's still gyft
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:41:26
I was going to say you could bid for some today ;)
@_date: 2014-09-09 02:01:02
Start reading some of the posts for the last 8 hours. You'll see what's up.
@_date: 2014-07-12 04:02:44
This shit happens to me all the time too. It sucks having to call my CC fraud dept. And admit that yeah I did make a purchase on said porn site. Some sites will not even go through period. And yep. Still get the awesome call... were you trying to buy some porn? Why yes ma'am I was.
Sucks balls.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:02:06
No fapping? What happened?
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:32:50
yeah, a few posts have already been made. Smells of a scam. But... you never know unless you try. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 23:49:07
Ok, well use windows then, I could care less. Have fun with all those virus's! ;)
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:45:19
Why would you pay people to watch youtube videos? Do people pay you to pump their videos for views?
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:32:51
Cannot access the BTC until it is fully synced. This will get you going. Follow these steps and you will be fine.
First off download the torrent file (once again this will take a while)
1. run bitcoin-qt (you already did this)
2. go to your appdata folder under your account and look for a bitcoin folder
3. Inside that folder you will find a file called wallet.dat
4. copy it elsewhere like to your desktop.
5. delete everything in that bitcoin folder
6. put the bootstrap file inside that bitcoin folder
7. put your wallet.dat you backed up into that same folder
8. run bitcoin-qt and wait some more ;)
Your btc should be there after fully synced
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:54:58
i registered. no personal info just username and password, it's dumb as hell. All you have to do is put in a capcha for each video and click play, open another tab, captcha/play, and the cycle continues. I can have as many videos open at once as I want or until my PC becomes unstable. Don't get the point.
@_date: 2014-08-29 20:17:16

Why not just use an exchange?
@_date: 2014-08-29 03:40:49
I think it's up to 0.5.18 update and try again
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:33:17
Seems legit.
@_date: 2014-07-10 03:58:09
You can use your Google voice number too. If you have one.
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:58:26
Huh? Do you mean... What does Microsoft sell for BTC that you can use with the linux OS?
I suppose you could use MS Office with wine? That would be a waste of money if you ask me, a fellow linux guy. Other than that I think there is nothing that MS could offer you (not sure as someone will probably let me know.) 
Whatever. Linux-Power bro.
@_date: 2014-06-28 21:13:09
Lol no. Quite the opposite.
@_date: 2014-08-02 03:59:21
I did it and haven't had any issues. Got sick of waiting 4 business days. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:36:59
I know what you mean... it's the little things in life...
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:19:27
You got it. It will take probably like a week or more for it to fully sync unless you download the bootstrap torrent...
Once synced you'll have your BTC.
@_date: 2014-08-05 01:38:01
The only  concern I would guess is that you would be trying to evade taxation, laundering or drug transactions etc. As long as you're not doing anything illegal I wouldn't worry about it.?
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:15:58
Only if it payed me in BTC would I use it. I'd set up a batch file and have it open/close a bunch of different sites 24/7, depending how BTC was being payed out. This of course would be in a VM. No way would I run this crap otherwise.
@_date: 2014-10-13 03:03:03
We're a little stressed out here... Have you noticed?
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:13:42
I can't believe that site still exists
@_date: 2014-08-08 19:34:54
I've always used cryptsy. Bter a few times as well.
@_date: 2014-06-29 12:54:51
I need to get my hands on some of those $10 bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-23 04:15:56
Been there. It sucks bad. Unfortionately I did it when I was drinking. Just shrugged it of of but the next day I kicked my own ass.
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:17:35
Did you upgrade windows? Linux? osx?
If windows check your c:\Users\ directory for your old profile or c:\Documents and Settings\. You probably just created a new user profile and your wallet should be there if in fact you did not format before installing.
Sorry, just re-read your post. Are you sure you replaced your new wallet.dat with your backup?
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:02:35
I can second this. I have only bought a $100 worth of btc total with that account though. So maybe I'm below the radar here.
@_date: 2014-07-22 23:42:52
They can access their wallet from any device. Just like 2fa a huge pain in the ass , who the hell needs to install a local wallet. Just kidding. Some might not be the brightest.
@_date: 2014-07-10 14:22:02
I will never be in this club...
@_date: 2014-09-29 01:47:49
Have to wait until you checking acct.clears
@_date: 2014-09-06 20:42:23
I get these calls at least 6 times a year. Really annoying. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 01:16:35
Yep they'll be there. Give it time.
@_date: 2014-06-21 02:57:32
Must have been a glitch in the matrix. I haven't had any issues.
@_date: 2014-07-21 00:19:56
Lol, method 2 seems much better. Can't believe you figured out Method 1. I would have gave up lol
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:24:46
lol I need bitcoin too
@_date: 2014-09-22 13:55:24
Better yet... Imagine biting into an apple...
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:26:17
yeah it will really take a long time...
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:37:56
Connect to a VPN and see what happens?
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:18:07
It could be anytime thursday. depending when the transaction clears. If you have a VISA you could add it to coinbase for instant purchasing. It will still come out of your checking but in case you don't have enough funds in your checking it will fall back to your card after the 4 days.
@_date: 2014-07-11 16:42:21
So did they remove the payment option? I'm in the US and don't see it. It was there yesterday.
@_date: 2014-09-22 13:51:30
Wonder what security would say at the airport about this?
@_date: 2014-06-27 01:23:17
What the hell is buffoon?
Hopefully not.
@_date: 2014-07-21 19:01:56
; ) oh I get you...
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:33:30
Wow. Talk about jumping through hoops.
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:57:43
Wow.... I feel like a dumb-ass. All I had to do was scroll down. Thanks buddy.
@_date: 2014-08-07 04:08:54
I cashed out too a long while when the value was in the 150 sat. range. Glad I did it then and not later.
@_date: 2014-09-10 13:02:46
Who knows,  with these kind of things. It will be publicity so chances are it might go up for a while but your guess is is as good as mine.
@_date: 2014-07-25 03:23:51
My mentality about credit is this... do a bit of research about credit card perks. Find one that suits you. Some give 5% cash back for gas stations and resturants, some give you flight miles. Some give you 1% cash back or sometimes a little more on any and all purchases. Think of it this way. Pay all the bills you can with credit if you choose the cash back one. Some credit cards will send you blank checks that will also count as perks. Others you have to request a dollar amount and they'll send the check. Kind of like online bill pay for your checking account. Just keep in mind you need to pay that card off monthly or you'll be throwing your money down the toilet. Never, ever carry a balance on your card... ever. You actually make out quite well if you work the system and have the willpower to say, nope I don't need that right now.
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:50:19
so you use coinbase as your primary wallet too?
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:42:55
First time seeing this. Pretty cool. Let us know how it works out.
What are the fees?
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:00:19
So how about someone I work with kindly brought in cryptolocker on a flash drive. It encrypted all the network shares that were shared between him and a a large group of people. That day was interesting.
@_date: 2014-12-25 01:51:19
Why not just buy a vpn? Then you can set up a http proxy on lets say a server, old laptop or whatever to proxy through the vpn? Just a suggestion.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:29:37
I'm not so sure... I have 2 stuck transactions with 0 fees.... Check this out please?
@_date: 2014-08-27 00:37:33
And this is why I rarely post, just lurk.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:50:53
Ok, Thanks again for the input. I appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:44:44
Ok, Thank you for your reply. In your opinion, do you think it may be wise to tag on a transaction fee of about 0.0005 or so? Or do you think 0.0001 would suffice? Or should I let bitcoin-qt just figure it out?
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:00:53
I think he just stumbled on this sub as well
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:05:51
this site sucks, he must only have like 30 videos. I only got 110 bits for putting in a capcha pressing play in 30 tabs and browsing reddit. it says no more videos now.
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:55:43
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:53:58
Exactly... Deposit fiat, buy crypto, send to wallet. Wouldn't let it sit any longer than it has to. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:33:08
or flappy coin. lol
@_date: 2014-07-21 02:17:27
Don't forget to blacklist all known vpn IPs too.
@_date: 2014-06-30 03:08:31
I've just used coinbase via checking. Have not used the credit option. Just hate waiting 4 business days. But, I guess that's a good thing because I always buy more than I think I need, so my BTC balance has been steadily increasing more than if I would buy just what I need at that point of time.
@_date: 2014-09-29 01:27:26
@_date: 2014-07-23 04:04:14
Shit I need to dump for flappycoins thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2014-07-06 13:28:02
I have-not idea where you could buy one for btc but thank you for the laugh ;)
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:19:52
You should have probably used electrum or multibit.
@_date: 2014-10-03 02:33:50
sometimes quite a while.
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:20:53
To sign up for hustler? You know when you get the urge...
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:15:02
Looks like you can if you're buying a bundle. I can't find it either if I try to make a purchase from the humble store.
@_date: 2014-10-02 14:40:30
Tried my VISA, was declined. Jumped back to coinbase. Insta-coin.
@_date: 2014-07-23 04:01:31
So can we use this thing wit bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-08-02 04:06:32
So a junkie buys a crack rock with USD. USD's illegal right? Lol. Just ignorance is all.
@_date: 2014-08-09 01:30:07
Yeah its the default search engine for IE. IE + Bing... You can't go wrong with such a great combination. :)
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:09:35
What is ethereum? A new coin? And why are people dumping BTC for it?
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:07:05
ipvanish is another alternative
@_date: 2014-09-24 23:53:46
there's a bot for this?
@_date: 2014-09-24 02:36:06
take this guys advice
@_date: 2014-09-22 17:26:34
Ok I'm covered then. Thanks
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:18:42
What are you talking about man? We're supposed to work for free. You should know this by now. Sheesh.
In seriousness. If someone needs computer help then chances are that they would be clueless about BTC. It would be awesome though to get tipped a few bits every once in a while.
@_date: 2014-06-20 16:57:08
Oh, sweet! I just checked and got the same email. Thanks, and have a good one. ;)
@_date: 2014-07-27 12:19:43
If you have a separate windows machine you could use this
Not free but it works well. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:26:01
@_date: 2014-07-15 12:09:32
That's what it sounds like to me. Seems like a good deal right? ;)
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:19:32
So are they referring to bitcoin as "wankcoin"? Or did some dumb ass really create it?
Edit: so I guess it's a real coin. They even have a wallet lol
@_date: 2014-06-20 15:21:43
Emailed them about it. I'll let you know what they say... if I get a response.
@_date: 2014-06-28 13:44:14
Tell him to just cash in the rent BTC for amazon gift cards on gyft or something. That way he can get all his Christmas, birthday, misc. holiday shopping done as he's sitting at his computer drinking a beer. Forget that holiday rush crap. Send that shit directly to my door. ;)
EDIT: Sorry I didn't answer any of your questions... Have a great day though!
@_date: 2015-07-02 01:50:37
I wish I may.
I wish I might.
Possibly receive some Bitcoin tonight.
@_date: 2015-04-05 18:40:51
You can buy Doge and exchange for BTC. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:18:05
fashionably late here.
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:21:24
Wow you have seriously tipped a lot!
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:21:49
I remember reading that you could buy secondlife (the game) lindens (i guess it's the games currency) then exchange them for bitcoins? Who knows if they'll take that card though. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:03:47
True that.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:50:46
Oops, I suck. Bitpay is what I want. I'll kindly leave....
Mods, you can delete this unless you want to keep it for awareness.
@_date: 2015-10-28 03:27:22
What's the deal. Why's it going up?
@_date: 2015-03-15 20:28:51
Nice. I'm starting to do the same thing since tax day is right around the corner. 
Your formulas would be appreciated as well. Thanks!
