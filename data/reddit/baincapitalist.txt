Only the entire history of the United States.

You want a chart of US recessions going back to before the existence of the United States? 
Also, are you trying to tell me that you didn't lose any wealth during recessions? And therefore don't care about Central banks preventing them?

Try again mate. You have to look at a graph of annual percentage change of the price level.

Recessions are caused by two things: demand shocks and supply shocks. The central bank can't do anything about supply shocks. But it certainly can do something for demand shocks. In fact, you may as well say that the central bank exogenously controls aggregate demand.

I made this graph myself. Your hypothesis can easily be tested using a T - correlation test. In fact, you could even do that for my hypothesis. Just check the p values for each to see which is more probable. I have the data set if you're actually interested in inquiry. DM me if you want it. 
I'm a market monetarist bro. There is literally no reason the money supply should be artificially constrained or even set on a growth path defined by some algorithm. The Money supply should reflect the demand for money, in other words the money supply should be perfectly elastic. Yet another way to put it: there should be a one to one increase in the quantity of money for every increase in the demand for money.

U serious? Imma tell my mom.

What you're asking for isn't a trivial thing to do... I'd have to find the data, clean it up, write it to a dataframe, and then code the graph. Honestly I'm not gonna do that much work unless the karmic returns are higher. 
Also, the price level has been much more stable since the creation of the Fed. Especially once we started price level targeting.

Inflation was higher but I'm talking price level stability. High inflation level doesn't mean that the price level was also volatile. They are not the same thing.
