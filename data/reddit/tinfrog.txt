Honestly, I don't think you're adding anything new to the discussion. Loads of people know that it's a massive bubble but are trying their luck to profit from it before it pops. That doesn't change the fact that the technology is something new, will open up new markets and likely  make more people rich in other ways. The exact same thing happened with the Internet.
IMO, a more interesting discussion revolves around what things will look like after the fall-out.

Honestly, for amounts like £15 it doesn't matter. The price difference would probably be less than choosing between a packet or crisps or a sandwich when you're peckish. Even at several hundred pounds worth it doesn't matter. Price really only becomes a factor when you're dropping several thousands in.
Not trying to belittle you or anything. (I know it can sound that way to some.) Only saying to put things in perspective. There's nothing magic about Bitcoin that sets it out from any other expense.
Just buy whenever you have spare money and don't worry about the price.

I'd say if people stop and think about it, most already know fiat currencies are digital.
There is a huge difference between fiat and crypto though. Fiat money is fully integrated into every area of our society so no-one needs to think about it. Crypto currencies are not. In fact, you could call crypto PITA currencies because for most people, they really are a PITA to use.
The majority of people don't care about the things you're talking about. They just want to be able to use money. 'No-one notices' fiat is digital because they don't need to.

I think you miss the point about libertarian/anarchist objection to regulation.

That would be a happy outcome but in a world without cash, it is easy for governments to make decentralised crypto-currencies irrelevant. The Government Blockchain effectively becomes your receipt for all purchases. It becomes their catalogue of your assets and expenses for tax purposes. Every single transaction, from purchasing a pack of chewing gum to the sale of a house or car can be recorded in the blockchain.
What if you get stopped for a traffic violation? *"Is that your car sir? OK let me check the GovChain...Sir, you did not legally purchase this car. It must now be impounded!"*  In this kind of world, what can you buy with bitcoin? How much value will it have?
From the point-of-view of financial freedom, cash and bitcoin are tied to the hip.
@_date: 2016-12-24 15:26:22


Lots of people say that but I'm not yet convinced. Cash is anonymous because there is no register of transactions. If all legal transactions can be registered, then everything else can be easily proved to be illegal because it's not on the register.
In the case of your example of paying rent, how many landlords will want to accept a currency that cannot be easily spent? What if proof of rental, for local government purposes (e.g. driving licence) or for signing up to utilities relies on the government blockchain? (If such a thing exists, no doubt it will be used for that purpose.)
Once a government-mandated crytpcurrency and blockchain exists, every activity outside that will now become blackmarket, contraband, illegal. Few people would want to live that way.
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:44:22


Just like they mandate anything, through laws and regulations. I'm not saying they're going to be successful, only that they could make it a legal requirement.
@_date: 2016-12-24 15:34:18


There's no reason that a government block chain needs to be centralized. It just needs to be mandated by the government.
@_date: 2016-12-24 11:25:59
The risk is that banks and governments are gradually waking up to bitcoin. They will create their own and mandate that everyone must use it. Once this happens, bitcoin and other non-government approved crypto-currencies can be made almost valueless. How?
All transactions on a government-mandated blockchain can be tracked. Tracking and cross-referencing will be automated. Once it's automated, it will be very difficult to spend or convert non-government currencies.
Ironically, crypto-currencies could herald even more financial control. Not many people talk about this outcome but it is worth considering.

Central banking doesn't offer government both micro and macro insight into everyone's legal financial activity. A government mandated blockchain in combination with a cashless society will.
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:55:17
You could be misunderstanding what I mean.  A 'government-mandated cryptocurrency and blockchain' may only be a buzzword but soon we'll have both the technology and the laws to put it into action. Once this is in place, they'll have both a micro and macro insight into everyone's legal financial activity. With that insight comes control. And remember, it doesn't have to be technologically perfect because the gaps are compensated by force.
I'm not saying that we need cash to bring bitcoin into the system. I'm saying that cash in one factor that gives bitcoin its value. The technology behind bitcoin won't matter if it becomes so burdensome to use it. Most people don't like living outside the law because of the stress it entails.
I like your optimism though.

Yes, I think so. I also believe that blockchain technology could help with this. If you think about it, a government that mandates all financial transactions be made using something similar to bitcoin will have a complete overview and control over a person's life.
@_date: 2015-09-19 13:07:40


Lots of people here are saying that outlawing cash would be great for Bitcoin. "It's really a good thing" (TM)
But think about it. Say the British government adopts 'BRITcoin' as a replacement for cash. Everyone has a government-registered wallet where all transactions are monitored (for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism purposes of course). Now they outlaw any transactions not made with BRITcoin. How are you going to buy Bitcoin? How are you going to convert any Bitcoin holdings anywhere other than the black market?
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:55:39


This is what they say the law is for but it's not. If they *really* wanted to stop money launderers, they'd close down institutions like HSBC. It does affect regular citizens because regular citizens will have a harder time making large non-cash payments. Do you think a big drug dealer, arms dealer or big-time money launderer will have this problem?
It's the start of a transition to a cashless society.
@_date: 2015-09-19 16:18:54
It would be impossible to enforce for people willing to go though the the black market, yes. But for the majority of the population, it would be easy. You'd just flag any transactions from non-approved sources and automatically apply a fine. You don't even have to ask for the money. It could be automatically debited from their BRITcoin wallet.
Edit: there's already an example of something like this happening in the UK but in a different area. Traffic cameras. If a traffic camera gets triggered through something deemed to be an illegal action, they automatically send a fine to the registered owner of the car. It's then up to the owner to defend his actions in court.
Now if you're a criminal, you could drive around in an unregistered or stolen car but how many ordinary people would do that?

All laws in many ways are stupid but they do give the appearance of doing something. Abolishing drugs don't keep drugs off the street. Abolishing weapons don't keep criminals from getting and using them. Abolishing murder doesn't stop murders.
@_date: 2015-11-18 10:07:24
But it's not. Again, I don't think you quite understand what being decentralized means. Bitcoin may be the preferred mechanism but that doesn't make it 'centralized'. People can choose any number of mechanisms including altcoins, precious metals and whiskey.
I don't see many people proposing that bitcoin is to hold much of the world's wealth. They may be saying that cryptocurrencies are a new paradigm for transferring or storing wealth. They're not saying everything *has* to be under bitcoin and controlled by a few developers/administrators.
