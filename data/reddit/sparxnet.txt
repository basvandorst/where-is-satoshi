What about other sites like Dropbox, Blockchain.info, Fastmail.fm, wordpress.com and many others that allow users to use the google authenticator app?
Do the backup codes provided by Google cover those too?
Best way I've found to back up is to make a Titanium Backup of the app+data and then store it in a secure place offline.

How similar / dissimilar is [Steve Gibson's SQRL]( protocol compared to this?

As expected. This sort of move was previously also done in 1978, although at that time, the anti-terrorism / counterfeiting wasn't so much a pertinent reason.

Desperation for what? 
It was done with the full knowledge of the inconvenience and public frustration that would undoubtedly occur, just so the existing trunks, cupboards and sometimes even room fulls of cash that have been discovered in Income Tax raids performed upon offenders, would not be allowed to be laundered and ill-gotten gains would be nullified expediently and immediately.

The existing ₹500 and ₹1000 currency notes are being withdrawn. New notes of denominations of ₹500 and ₹2000 are being released to the public in their stead. It is being done for two major reasons:
1. The new notes have stronger countermeasures against counterfeiters (mostly those from Pakistan) who use the ill-gotten gains to finance terrorists.
2. People who have hoarded unaccounted for and untaxed cash will now be forced to declare a part of it or have to forego major chunks of it.
