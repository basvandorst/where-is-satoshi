Fair point! In that case a traditional savings account lacks the same incentive, but it makes up for it in stability.

I also didn't like that about cloudhashing. However, in my eye the cloudhashing service [CEX (NON-REFERRAL LINK)]( -- ([Referral Link! Yay!]( addresses the issue directly. Since I came here to read glorious rants about a bad business model, I'm compelled to rant about positive ideas that could improve it.
CEX's idea is that users can buy portions of the total gigahashing power and sell them at any time. These portions of the total power (called GHS or gigahashes) even have their own market, the price of which increases and decreases with the forces of supply and demand. There are no contracts here, or fixed prices on shares of their computing power. And, well heck, it's another market to play with. Their fees are $0.0000005369 on every share ([source]( so I thought why not.
So I put $30 (0.037) in and received 1.11GHS of power. In two days, including the positive increase in the values of GHS and BTC, I've made $0.44 - and you know what's funny, that's a lot more than the big fat ZERO I would have made from keeping $30 in a Savings or Checking account for two days. Might even be worth more than the interest I earned on my Savings last year. 
Seems kind of like a bank that generates interest daily, to me. But if there are any accountants out there, by all means, correct me if I'm wrong here.

It's also quite a small premium to pay to avoid the percentages that other similar sites take to carry out the same service.
Source: I tried out Paxum's instant deposit service last week and the company took $5 off $60, then I paid $2 from the $55 remaining to use Bitinstant to move the money to MtGox. boo.
