Given the example above how does the fee schedule work ? For example if you were making these trades at BitMEX using the XBU7D, would you pay the .10% (Makers) or the .3% (Takers) fee and when are those fees calculated ? When trade short @ 405 or when it expires or both ? A complete example showing all the math would be awesome. Thanks !

Thank you for the interesting article but I have a question on Case 1. I understand you had 2.5 BTC and you purchased 10 contracts @ 405. When those contracts expire they are @ 500. Exactly how is the Profit/Loss of -.4692 shown in the image calculated ? Can you step me through the math ?

I try and live by the old adage "If it's too good ...". So I am wondering what the catch is here. It seems like this is an awesome idea so why isn't everyone doing it?

So OKCoin isn't really a good option for this strategy because the socialized loses are not mitigated?

Thank you for the list of fees. I was wondering if you might be able to step through it like I was 5 years old because I am having a bit of issue getting my head around this?
 
With the given info:
BitMEX account currently has 2.5 BTC (Which I purchased at $400 USD / BTC, don't worry about fees prior to this point) 
Makers who provide liquidity will be paid 0.10%. Takers will pay 0.30%.
Spot is $400 USD
10 Contracts sold for $405 USD
Contracts settle at $500 USD 
How do I calculate exactly what the final profit in USD would be ?

Ok so the people running nodes how do they get paid ? or do they? Are nodes run just for the fun of it or is there a profit motive ?
