I agree. I've been very fortunate with my crypto gains, and as of today, those holdings still constitute part of a larger, balanced portfolio that includes boring "traditional" investment vehicles. I realize that part of my traditional savings has allowed me to make a play at Bitcoin, and I did so because I am very excited to see what the future holds for crypto in general. 
TL;DR Crypto investments should remain a portion of an investment portfolio that spans multiple industries and investment vehicles
Edit: also, forgot to say congrats to OP on his good fortune!

Good move. I cashed out my principal investment today, plus a little extra. Left the rest in a cold wallet, and it's all just icing on the cake. Looks like all Christmas gift shopping will be taken care of courtesy of this BTC boom! Also, where did you get that mug?

Hey friend! I can help start you off on the right track.
Step 1: Head on over to the international crypto mining forum website: boards.4chan.org/b/
Step 2: Create a new post. Introduce yourself to the community by typing your name, social security number, date of birth,  home address and your credit card numbers (including the security codes). Don’t forget to announce that you’re “doxing” yourself (“doxing” means that you are new crypto miner and are looking for advice). The friendly people at 4chan need this information to help get you started on your crypto mining journey!
Step 3: ???
Step 4: Profit
