Short answer: yes.
Long answer (which is actually a question): How will the Bitcoin scene look like in the next few months? Time will tell. Right now, it's incredibly hard to predict. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:41:07
True. You can blame Henry Farell for that one. Though the author doesn't make the slightest effort to mention the obvious. Then again, to be fair, some regulators (thinking of Australia here) really show the same lack of understanding of what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:58:37
This news is flooding Twitter. To be fair, it's big news for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:31:41
We're glad you think so. :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:58:37
First of all, thank you very much for your feedback. Our bug tracker was feeling hungry today. We will be working on that in a jiffy. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 16:16:20
Could be a useful.
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:49:55
And the update is in. Thank you for reporting it. We now display rates as µBTC/min.
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:30:51
This would break the Internet. And news. Kind of makes you wander what it would be like if this happened, doesn't it? 
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:42:29
Great synopsis. :) We couldn't agree more. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:48:22
Nice catch :)
@_date: 2014-11-28 16:08:18
Security was really important for us. Thank you for noticing. If there's anything more we can do to make you feel more secure, please let us know. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:33:15
Yeah, microtransaction services will take off. We're very curious how Bitcoin hype will affect non-adopters. Will there be more Bitcoin owners? Here's to hoping :)
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:42:44
True. Though currently, it's not a good time to be a Bitcoin startup there. It's sad that often governments only "fix the bridge after somebody has fallen". Though this case is even a bit more extreme.
@_date: 2014-12-10 17:29:04
As a Business running on Bitcoin, we would be satisfied with this outcome. True, it would be preferable if the price of Bitcoin didn't fluctuate so much, but at the end of the day it's there in all its glory. So, to answer your question, we would be happy. But mainly what would make us happiest is the Bitcoin community growing and flourishing. Furthermore, when Bitcoin adoption rises far beyond its current state, we think that people should never forget the early days.
@_date: 2014-12-10 17:10:08
They make valid points. In fact, Bitcoin adoption is an issue of resistance, which shouldn't be the case for millennials. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:25:04
We're happy to say that we're working on just that. Sorry for the inconvenience. Thanks for making this platform better :)
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:11:08
Blockchain is a great place for advertisers, given its traffic volume and clear market. It's safe to say they get a good revenue stream. Still nice of them to do what they did. As a company these days you should put being human on top of everything else. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:42:33

:) Well put
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:42:08
Thank you! :) Yeah, you can call right away with no installs just as long as you do it from either of these (we are working hard on increasing that list)
•   Chrome
•   Chrome for Android
•   Firefox
•   Opera
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:35:56
Of course. You can save the number right in your address book. :) We're right here if you need more help. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:15:36
The saddest thing is how predictable this outcome was. :(
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:18:42
This can sum up to resistance to change on the one hand. For companies like Mastercard, Bitcoin believers are what in Economics is "the greater fool".
Really, what we expect is for them to end up like BlackBerry. Remember this " ?
Too stubborn to commit to change, yet too cautious to ignore it. That's at least how it looks on the outside.
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:07:30
They should. And the truth is, the more articles appear on this topic, the more likely it is that they will change their mind. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:02:06
Wow :) You were on a roll. Truly, the worst thing you could probably do is base your opinion on the future of Bitcoin on prediction articles - even good ones (which this one isn't). On the other hand, these articles do bring up the topic of the future, which is always good. Honestly, the most down to Earth approach (for us, at least) is looking at the community. There are some power brokers among the community, sure. But at the end of the day, the value of Bitcoin can be broken down by considering socio-psychological aspects, grace of decentralization.
@_date: 2014-12-12 15:15:14
They're trying out the field. Bitcoin adoption will continue to rise. But everyone is right, this is just PR. Still, with the recent Microsoft announcement, and the dell announcement before it, it's plausible that Bitcoin adoption will start to take a lot of momentum. On the other hand, price stability will make it unfriendly territory for companies like American Express, because they will have to give out loans with major risk factors attached. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:41:12
It's really hard to tell where Bitcoin will be next year. There are a lot of unknown variables. For one: what will regulators do next? Secondly: is it time much more adopters come on board (starting a trend)?
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:45:42
It's sensible to expect Bitcoin adoption to rise in 2015. Now the distinction is: how many merchants will keep those bitcoin stored as is and how many will exchange it for another currency (and are therefore using it as an additional form of payment). 
You could expect that people may have more incentive to keep their Bitcoin, due to the rise in numbers of Bitcoin-accepting businesses. 
The most plausible case is that bitcoin price will decrease due to a combination of speculators cashing in and merchants exchanging currency due to the fear that bitcoin will drop in value, which may lead to a new wave of bitcoin owners.
What does this all mean? With the rise in popularity of bitcoin and the growing number of companies (new and old) that accept bitcoin, it's gaining acceptance as a form of payment worldwide and shifting from a merely speculative interest.
This is our musing, at least. Anyone else want to have a poke at the topic?
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:13:39
Yup. Missing the point of Bitcoin. It's like saying "the problem with train tracks is that trains travel on them".
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:46:32
It's hard for Forbes to keep up. It's not hard to imagine where Bitcoin stories fall in the 'story bin'. That being said, except for the title, it's a fairly balanced article.
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:47:40
Yeah, but it's still really hard to enforce any legal measures to effectively stop their operations. Hence, a little leverage. When you do the Math, the benefits don't seem to outweigh the costs. Unless you count PR. In which case, they're doing pretty well at the moment.
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:59:14
How is their exchange any different except for the fact that "your dollars never leave the US"? Not saying it should be. But is there more innovation at work, or 'just' a pitch for the conservative? 
@_date: 2015-01-23 14:29:12
Thanks :) That clears it up nicely.
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:17:56
Technically, yes. But they might have some leverage.

Go check out the article about the two-factor authentication feature on our blog:  Let us know what you think about the 2FA!
@_date: 2016-11-10 10:46:43
 What's your opinion on this? 
@_date: 2016-11-01 08:21:12
What destinations have you called to?  How was your experience?
@_date: 2016-09-16 01:13:10
During the launch, XCoinCall will Double all Deposits up to 100mBTC. Users will be able to talk twice as long from any device using xcoincall’s simple browser-based dialer. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 01:13:48
@_date: 2016-09-20 03:42:58
XCoinCall is able to connect 2 phones together. If you check "Connect with my phone" you can make calls between the destination number and your number. First your number is called, after you answer you are put on hold ( nice music :) ) and the other party is called . After the other party is connected please talk a lot :) . Of course both calls are billed. We hope to reduce the costs for this feature in the next weeks.

Thank you for the observation, we'll try to be more careful next time; despite the spelling mistakes, maybe you would like to try our service and give us your thoughts about the product?

Thanks. In case you need us, we are here!
@_date: 2016-09-20 02:23:13
Thank you for the question. We apologize for not answering you immediately, we did some research, and we decided to let you, the users, to answer to this question. We are confident that you will enjoy using our service! 
@_date: 2016-09-16 12:54:35
Thank you, you have a point here! This would be ideal, but does it always work? Sometimes you need to call someone who's not on Skype (or any other similar app) or who is offline. This is where we come, offering you a cheap alternative.   
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:20:27
We just launched our service and we are working continuously to lower the rates and to offer better deals; hopefully you will eventually find our rates more attractive. Thank you for your feedback, much appreciated. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 13:27:33
Thank you for your feedback, much appreciated! 
@_date: 2016-10-25 19:42:31
Thank you, we think too that the users must know the rates beforehand, therefore everybody can check the rate list before registering with us or depositing any amount. But also, you should keep in mind that our October promotion is still on, we double your deposit for each amount between 1-100mBTC, so practically the charged rate would cost you half!
@_date: 2016-10-21 13:34:07
Thank you for asking. The registration is free. You can find on our website  the standard rates by destinations, and we can assure you it is worth trying, you can talk like forever due to the very low rates! And you can take advantage of our October promotion: we double your deposit, for each 1-100 mBTC deposited we will match you the amount! We would love your feedback!
@_date: 2016-10-24 23:30:03
Hi, we are trying to find the best carriers to lower the rates, we are sorry you are disappointed! We do not charge any monthly fee or registration fee, it is a pay as you go service. The US rates are not flat for every US zone, some are cheaper and some are more expensive, but we are trying to offer a single rate for all US areas.
