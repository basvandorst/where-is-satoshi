Cheaper than what AMEX, VISA, and Mastercard charges me... Not to mention the lease on a point-of-sale machine. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:30:34
issue with that is confirmation time from my understanding then later on at some point i will have to go to an exchange to exchange it to FIAT. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:28:36
I'm confused you says use another coin at my store, but then you say other cryptocurrencies as a commodity. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:52:49
Cool thanks!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:23:04
We have an event and coworking space. I just want to add it as an option as a form of payment. I doubt many of if any will pay in Bitcoin. I just don't want to deal with standing around waiting for confirmation with the person. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:19:16
Too bad they're aren't us based...
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:20:14
I don't know how to do that I'm not a developer and I don't want to deal wait times. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:52:34
Well we plan to use US based business exchange service Bitpay, so I believe that eliminates the wait aspect as they provide our funds to us after 24 hours. Just like a credit card company when a customer swipes their card. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:26:38
Not anymore they stopped.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:23:31
Coinbase no longer allows businesses to register. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:07:17
exactly my point i can just use bitpay to handle that...

I keep telling retards ITT I've made my investment back and then some but these reddit ass clowns don't get it or understand mining. I'm still making money. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 12:57:37
I wonder who they are using as Bitcoin processor.
@_date: 2014-02-05 23:37:36
uhhh ebay owns paypal....

What is ITT?
@_date: 2014-01-14 13:25:41
I can purchase addtional GH/s and sell the GH/s I purchased. You also earn other crypto currencies. You can sell the Namecoin you earn on their cex.io exchange for BTC. 0% mining fee
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:18:09
Post my agenda with links moron.
@_date: 2014-01-09 01:17:18
Actually your wrong...
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:04:11
I made the Bitcoins with "miners" in my basement that have already been paid off 6 months ago and I cash in my Bitcoins daily for cash so I can do the things you just mentioned without lifting a finger... I created money from thin air....
@_date: 2014-01-23 14:02:29
same shit. You're trading a "commodity". The goal is to buy it low sell high.. That's synonymous with trading moron. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:19:07
Soo let me get this straight. I purchased something for $600 USD and I've been able to profit $300 within 3 months (that's after BFL equipment cost). And I'm still making money buy doing abosolutely nothing. I no longer have to purchase anything. When I sleep, eat, and have sex this thing is making me money. I cash in my BTC that my Butter Fly Labs equipment is making me or sometimes I use the BTC that I mine to purchase stuff on overstock. My goal is to buy a Rolex on Overstock with the Bitcoin that my miners make.. Loser.

Hey dumb ass read this:
And this:
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:37:09
Def not poor made $500+ after I sold my GH/s on Tuesday that I bought on Sunday.. And I'm earning coins every 8 minutes. Every 24 hours I cash my coin for FIat. All profit baby.
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:09:46
+0.002 BTC
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:47:50
sooooo when the GH/s hits .04 and I buy then I sell at .048 Is that not a profit????? 
Right now it's at .042 per GHS with a day high of .45 today.. They also have a awesome pool that I'm currently mining on, that not only mines BTC but other crypo currency (that I don't care for).   
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:57:54
oh.... 
* Well here it is: 
* oh and here: 
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:33:44
No one didn't anything at BTCGUILD. If you don't like it you can't desolve your self of BTC... 
@_date: 2014-07-12 22:13:43
yeah but no one posted about it on reddit... 
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:48:07
Yeah but do those other pools find blocks as often? Also I like the fact that I can purchase GH/s to use with my physical miners and then sell what I purchased for a profit (only if it goes up higher than what I purchased it for)
@_date: 2014-10-26 18:10:13
Doesn't say why r/bitcointip was shutdown and it's not even the same guys
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:33:09
lUCky for you miners exist and I'll keep cashing in my BTC just about daily. My miners have already been paid for long time ago with my profits. I barely have any power cost. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:15:48
But at CEX.IO I can sell what I purchased to make an additional profit and I can actually mine there.
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:23:33
Umm I am.. Like I said until I see BTC dropping in price as a result then I may reconsider...
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:48:10
Did you **"the shrinking of pools as larger private farms coming online, the variance of PPS (on the pool side) has become too significant for BTC Guild to continue offering."**
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:06:57
GOOD, FUCK RUSSIA...
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:38:37

@_date: 2014-01-15 02:05:53
FYI, in vase you didn't get the memo GHASH doesn't have any fees.. I can also purchase addtional GH/s to add to my miners and sell it on CEX.IO i ALSO earn other crypto currencies with this pool as well.....
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:56:35
Dear dumb asses in this thread who don't know anything about investing, auctions, money and math... The bid starts at 200k if someone where to invest 200k and that person is the only person to bid then they get the 18 million woth in coins.. NOW how on earth do you dumb fucks thing somone will be able to dump that many coins that fast to turn a profit... NO WHERE!!! There is no demand for that many bitcoins...

Keep in mind if it wasn't for the miners you would have no BTC.

If this is true it's funny and interesting to read what the TSA reps thought a Bitcoin looked like.. How many physical coins would that be about 20 or so??

Uhh and how is this a scam? I'm not gaining anything out of this. What you're saying would make sense if I was posting my own referral link, but I didn't. I like this pool and the concept of trading GHs.

They told me upfront I would have to wait and gave me my number in line and posted messages just about daily what number/batch they were on and I'm currently making lots of money with the miners I got with them.. SO I have no complaints.

* .006 BTC
* .00159957 NMC
* .00749066 IXC
* .32319451 DVC 
with my 10GHs rig. 
I haven't purchased any of their GH yet. I'm waiting for it to hit .04 per GH/s to buy then sell when it goes back up (fluctuates pretty often).
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:32:02
No way I love this pool!!! and CEX.IO
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:32:55

@_date: 2014-02-02 11:32:43
Well either way they are down. Look at your workers even the cloud miners are not mining anymore..
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:05:27
I just made a profit today. I purchased 1.5 GHs for .35BTC and sold today for .40 BTC not to mention that 1.5GHs was added to my worker on their pool... Sooo win win for me.........
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:38:54
Well if it is then let it die. Then we will move on to the next big thing.. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:26:11

Even though I made a profit this week on cex.io???
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:17:07
Because I can sell what I purchased to make an additional profit and I can actually mine there.
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:30:48

Actually there is no contract they mine for you and it goes to your wallet instantly. I highly suggest you read or do research before you speak on something you know nothing about. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:17:32
In 4 days via CEX.IO and GHAS.IO I've made $534 in profit.. I've yet to see BTC crash as a result of GHASH.IO  
Thanks for the good luck.
@_date: 2014-06-13 08:51:12
If you knew anything about the English language you idiot, you would know that the word "dumber" doesn't exist you dumb ass. Secondly there's know why this auction is going to reach over 2 million. No Bitcoin exchange site is going to exchange even 1000 Bitcoins... 
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:38:10
Exactly because I love Ghash.IO it is very appealing to me as a miner.
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:04:02
oh well... Another system will crop up.. That's why I love free market..

Both independent miners can purchase GH/s to add to their workers and of course sell it on the CEX.IO market.

Before you know it the media will say terrorist are using Bitcoin... 
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:17:08
lmao.. That sems a bit odd for GPU mining. I think this guy is lying. I CPU mined and earned BTC granted it was extremely small amount, but I earned BTC. So either A you're lying, B you're trying to be funny, or C your stuff is configured wrong. If it's A or B then your an asshole and this post should be deleted.
@_date: 2014-01-21 04:10:18
Don't forget to pay taxes if you're in the US you fake ass idiot.  I love my jalapenoS. I paid for them back in Oct 2012 if my memory serves me correctly.. Buhahha Well Mr. 1Upper I hope you are prepared to pay a lot in capital gains taxes once you cash your coins in. If you're a US citizen that is.. Now clearly your a child or a moron. Why would you waste that much money to save up for a car when you could invest in property a business etc etc. Which leads me to believe your a broke ass poser. I'd pay towards the principal of my mortgage or something if I had that much in BTC... 
@_date: 2014-01-04 05:36:50
Me to I just signed up with them today. Seems legit to me. I didn't invest a lot though. However all my miners are pointing at their pool now...
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:41:56
I didn't have any plans for the thread. I spoke my mind. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:00:22
Actually I do and BTCGUILD has been going through many changes for the worst compared to most major pools. They are dying....
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:08:13
Well with this pool we are CONSTANTLY lucky compared to BTCGUILD and Triplemining, and Slush. So at the end of the day my daily bottom line with them is higher... Miners typically don't mine for fun it's for profit.. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:21:44
I'm fucking confused here. My miners have already paid for themselves and I make money daily. I cash in my BTC almost daily for actual USD cash.. So I'm confused as to how can you say mining is no longer profitable if I'm cashing USD almost everday. I don't keep my BTC I cash them asap for USD.  SO WTF are you talking about?
@_date: 2014-03-30 10:12:47
Make a press release to major outlets providing your Bitcoin address will help ensure you are legit. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:38:11
Good question, I've actually wondered that myself. I think the majority of it is CEX/GHASH.IO servers/rigs not external miners like myself.

@_date: 2014-01-12 17:41:58
Significant for miners and people that do Cloud based mining.. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:25:22
BTCGUILD finds blocks often, but no where near the amount of GHASH and Triplemining barely finds blocks anymore. I doubt I would make the same amount on those two pools.
@_date: 2014-01-16 13:15:13
I think it's more if you see the downvotes in my civil comments.

Also for you idiots that down voted see this:
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:37:06
Like I said my miners are pointed at GHASH "connected"... I'm making BTC every 8 minutes.
Right now would be dumb to purchase GH/s on CEX.IO because the price is to high. I purchased on Sunday when it was low, then sold on Tuesday when it went up, but I'M STILL MINING with my rig on there because I'm making BTC, NMC, IXC, and DVC every 8 minutes on GHASH.
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:39:46
LMAO. I'm a full-time employee and I make a lot of money with my job..... My setup is mostly USB powered and jalapenoS. i'M also using a raspberry pi as the "cpu" which uses just about no power, so I'm always in the green each day.

Pet projects like the Internet and TOR. Or free education (K-12) for all unlike many countries. Building transportation networks. The Federal government funded the telegraph and laid the first transatlantic cable. THE GOVERNMENT ALSO SPARKED MOBILE COMMUNICATION REVOLUTION BY AUCTIONING OF SPECTRUMS for you to use your cell phone. The government built the hydro electric dams. The US government invented GPS and MRI.
Like I tell people like you all the time (if you're an American that is) if you don't like it get the fuck out. WE ARE NOT STOPPING YOU. DON'T COME BACK. If you can find somewhere better stay there don't come back. Pay your taxes and STFU. You can also not pay your taxes to and see what happens...

Are you for asking me that dumb ass question.
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:57:35
Does p2pool earn other Crypto currencies as well? Like NMC? Does P2Pool work with raspberry pi? Does P2Pool work miners like antminer, USB bitfury, block erupter, and jalapeno?

nope... Who still blogs in 2014?

Yes there is a a waiting period. I use Virwox often. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:20:55
Well I still don't see BTC crashing as a result. The only thing I see is  GH/s price going up on CEX.IO 
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:32:20
Yup your point is what?
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:35:54
Well I'll be a retard with thousands in profit (already cashed out in FIAT).. Want a loan.. And I'll keep mining with GHASH..
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:28:50
Does coinbase allow you to sell BTC?

Wait your a seal why do you need the USMC? I think your a punk and you don't have the balls to show your sniper skills you learned on call of duty with a modded controller. Buhaha. How does a Seal operate in the United States legally? Esp against a USPER? I'm confused.. Man you sound really scary. What type of sniper rifle did you use when you were deployed. Also where were you stationed.. You sound pretty tough man..  bahahaha 
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:59:26
Well I see no drop in price in BTC, but I do see a price increase in GH/s on the CEX.IO exchange!
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:28:01
It wouldn't be too late because the Bitcoins I've mined the past month alone is all profit. My rig has paid for it's self already months ago and I'm barely using any electricity for my rig since I'm using a raspberry pi, bitfury sticks, and block eruptors, and one clunking jalepeno.. If BITCOIN dropped to a dollar I'd still be in the green.
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:18:58
There isn't one you can buy and sell whenever you want. And the GH/s you purchase is mining while you hold it. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 02:30:58
I got my mining devices from BFL and I making a decent amount of money with them. It took awhile (WHICH THEY STATE ON THEIR WEBSITE), but I got it and I'm mining. Don't listen to these ass clowns on reddit. Use other sources to make a informed decision. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:16:06
Fuck that... That's what you idiots get for investing via a foreign ( non-US) Bitcoin exchange... 
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:56:40
Here is my first miner:
~~Here is my first "rig"
I'll take a picture of my current setup when I get home just for you... How am I trolling??
Here is my first rig:
Here is my second rig:
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:36:26
Well you should delete your reddit account because this is an American company.....
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:44:59
Same could be said about anti-GHASH. How you call this trolling is beyond me.. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 07:29:53
I read that link and even some of the other miners and people that know numbers said the same buy low sell high.. With regards to your trolling. The first page of your profile is nothing but you trolling like (sorted by "new")
[HERE]( *You tried to call someone that was talking about a wikipedia link a scammer.......*
Are you even a miner??
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:20:27
I can do math. I did this past weekend. I purchase GH/s @ .03 and some change GH/s then sold it @ .04 and some some change GH/s making a $500+ profit and while I was holding on to it it was mining for me in addtion to my phyiscal miner, so WTF are you talking about moron.
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:48:36
Uhh I've already cashed out so I made a profit.. I'm all green this past week with GHASH.IO and CEX.IO 
I haven't purchased GH/s in the past 10 hours because you folks on reddit are driving the price up on CEX.IO.
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:55:16
Thank you Sir, may I have another?
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:18:12
It wasn't that high on Sunday night when I purchased and the GH/s I purchased was mining for me in addtion to my physical miner, so it added my workers GH/s while I was waiting for the price to go up and it did on Tuesday. I sold all my GH/s I purchased FOR PROFIT and then cashed in fiat.
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:28:46
This guy is awesome I'm adding him as a friend.
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:31:00
You do not see a possible threat when you use your credit card at a store rather than using cash,  you don't see a possible threat when you invest in the stock market?
I do see the possible 51% attack as threat with any pool like they used to say about BTCGUILD. I'm okay with that threat
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:29:32
Haters gonna hate.. I knew it would, but I don't care. I'm only being honest here. I didn't post any links etc etc.
@_date: 2014-04-10 02:37:03
Well I wasn't trying to sell Bitcoins it's the fact that I mentioned I accept Bitcoins as wll they shut it down..
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:19:05
How am I dick. I have some interest in Bitcoin, but how can anyone that likes money ignore the profts. I'm making thousands out of thin-air....
@_date: 2014-02-22 11:57:46
WTF does this have to do with ? Read the rules of the subreddit..
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:50:36
Now the BTCGUILD hashing power is going back up close to the numbers when many people where bitching..  Again you can dissolve your self of BTC or STFU and ride the wave.
@_date: 2014-07-25 12:40:30
The drive is done... 
@_date: 2014-01-20 01:38:12
You are the biggest retard known to man.. I purchased two jalapenos and I received them back in July 2013 (about $600 bucks and some change). When I made 1 BTC (took about 3 months) I cashed in that Bitcoin and it was about $900 something... soo hopefully your retarded ass can do math and see I already paid my investment off and then some. LIKE I SAID I MADE MONEY YOU IDIOT. I'M STILL MAKING MONEY FROM THIN AIR. Investment already paid for. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 07:03:00
Thanks 
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:09:51
not at all. You're new to Bitcoins aren't you troll.
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:22:34
I've made profits in the thousands and continue to make profits daily.
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:14:36
I trade on the stock market and currency exchanges (FOREX) as well and you def don't make more money that me. Mining is my hobby that makes me money.. For the record I purchased 110 shares of Google in 2005 and still own it...  I just recently made a shit ton in option trading on MGM 
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:37:33
Did I say they were going to continue to offer it's services. I said they are dying. They keep adding restrictions and can't keep up with the Cloud computing pools it's a sinking ship.... STFU and let it die.
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:55:42
I cashed out my coins that I made profit on for fiat already, so my mining efforts thus far have not been in vein. People said the same thing about BTCGUILD:
* 
* 
* 
I suspect most of you folks that are anti-GHASH aren't even miners or know how to invest in BTC properly to cash out at the right time..
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:25:25
Wasn't posted to @_date: 2014-01-04 06:06:26
Thanks man cause that's what I look forward to every morning I wake is to convince everyone on reddit on something I post.. I hope to earn my PHD in trolling like you.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:25:25
Haha at you stupid fucks that didnt' get the hint when the U.S. Feds indicted them and froze their accounts... 
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:40:25
NO: SEE: 
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:09:51
Yeah, but not on MTgox if you're an American... 
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:40:53
Can you sell BTC? Also how fast can you get BTC or fiat?
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:15:23
Bitcoins shouldn't be about making money which is why most of you folks are bitching. It's my understanding Bitcoin wasn't invented just so people could use purely as an investment, but as a form of currency.  Unless I actually see BTC plummeting then I would reconsider, but as of right now I'm still mining with GHASH.IO and making BTC on average every 8 minutes with them. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 01:17:27
See how you make money here:
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:27:51
Has for me. With Tripleming with I barely made any coin. BTC Guild I made some. With GHASH I made a shit ton of BTC and I have the ability to purchase more hash power for my mining rig and sell it for potential PROFIT.
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:41:59
Uhh cause cash is king and I'm making huge returns in profit.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:14:09
I wish this guy would give us a Bitcoin address to donate to!
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:10:44
Of course I care but as right now while I'm trying this response to you I'm still making a profit mining with them because our pool finds blocks in minutes. For the idiots that are holding on to BTC purely on speculation that it will hit 2,000USD etc etc. You are retarded for not cashing out your profits. It's almost like stocks. You purchase a stock it goes up and you hold out thinking your going to be a millionaire and the stock crashes now your a dumb ass...
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:58:08
I was CPU mining in 2009.. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:36:44
You've got to be retarded for making that comment. On Tuesday I purchased at .03 and sold at .044 and purchased a lot and made a $500+ profit in less than a week... I guess I'm a retard for that.... 
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:32:00
I will making coins every 8 minutues.. Go GHASH.IO GO!!
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:13:12
Any idiot that didn't already know this deserves to be audited. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 13:06:09
* 1 I don't GAF what you've done with Bitcoin, who you talk to etc etc. NO ONE CARES!! I've never seen someone use the letter "I" so much until I read this corny ass comment. 
* 2 When did I say you don't know about Bitcoins? Clearly you don't use reddit because as you can see my response was to , so how you thought that was to you is beyond me. Unless you have multiple reddit accounts, which I believe is against TOS. 
I TRY to remain civil on reddit, but when I encounter self-centered assholes like you, trolls, and racist I go in.. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:18:39
Your original post was eluding to that this was scam etc etc blah blah.. We are done here.. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:19:48
I've made a decent profit the past couple of days with them. I started the beginning of this week trading and mining with my mining rig. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:25:46
But not in the negative.. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:25:11
Yup you hit the head on the nail. Also: 
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:09:16
GOTO ghash.io have you login and you will see it's no longer mining!
@_date: 2014-01-28 02:16:27
No different than you mowing lawns for cash. The IRS doesn't know. No different then someone babysitting, the IRS doesn't know. No different than a barber receiving tips, the IRS doesn't know. Why did you ask this dumb ass question?
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:04:29
Rolex's maintain their value. There's more risk involved in the BTC exchanges than a miner. I will keep informing these morons not to mention if miners didn't exist there would be no BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-21 04:33:40
Please contact Coinbase as they have the best reputation. They recently helped Overstock.com accept Bitcoins. 
Accepting Bitcoin is just like receiving anything else that is of value
Yes you can use Bitcoin as a ticket or proof-of-purchase via something like Coinbase or the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-07-11 12:19:36
Neither of those are for the miner subcategory there genius... 
@_date: 2014-10-26 18:22:19
What do you mean they "sold out"
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:15:10
Now how does a bitcoin tip get voted down...
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:54:36
YUP!!

Why should I leave if I mine there?
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:40:56
Try it if you want to I have enough guns and ammo for you and your Internet goons that would ever try to kill my family. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:24:03
I've mined at BTCGUILD for 3 months and Triplemin for 6 months neither has earned me no where near the coin I've earned at GHASH.IO not to mention I'm earning other cryptocurrencies and I have the ability to purchase addtional hashing power to my physical miner and sell it if I want FOR possible profit.
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:20:29
My rig has been pointing there for about a week and I'm making some decent "coin". Long live ghash.io
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:01:48
Actually they don't you provided services by the federal government and state for that matter. Reporting "mining" income is like reporting any other "business" income. You have expenditures and income. Simple.. Pay your freaking taxes! That's what you're suppose to do!
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:42:43
In one week I've made more BTC than I have with BTCGUILD in 2.5 weeks.. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:18:13
uhhh bad username...
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:38:56
I love this pool! I also love the fact I can buy GH/s to put towards my worker and sell it like a stock on their cex.io exchange.  Long live GHASH.IO and CEX.IO 
@_date: 2014-07-25 15:01:29
at least 5 BTC
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:53:26
Yeah I did unlike you and did you visit CEX.IO for yourself. When my order goes through for .04 GH/s and I sell for .048 or more I'll make sure to screen shot to you and the rest of the retards who don't understand pure numbers. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:44:12
No I am not. The person that did the double spend was fired. I'm not leaving.. Do you even mine BTC is my question. If not STFU if you don't mine.
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:37:37
Only at low prices of course, but I also have my physical mining rig pointed there.
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:27:49
Yup! and I made my profits and cashed out in fiat. After I've cashed out my profits in fiat I'm still mining. I haven't purchased anymore GH/s on CEX.IO since Sunday because the price is to high and I suspect it's because of all this rhetoric on reddit...
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:11:20
Hmm let me see.... The people that had money/BTC in a MT.Gox account should have had a clue when the Feds indicted them, clue number two should have been when the Feds seized their Bank of America account almost a year ago.. These should have been clues for you these retards to get out!. I have no empathy for idiots.
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:03:10
Look at your workers speed on the actual pool website!!

Damn you're broke.
@_date: 2016-01-02 10:48:42
Good point. Maybe post a sign up that says DO NOT PAY RANSOM were contact law enforcement. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 11:02:10
it's really not for fun. It's more so our customers can say ahh cool they even have a Bitcoin ATM. Our demograph is the techno type not a coffee shop.
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:59:25
you know what Fiat is in terms of currency right? 
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:40:50
I want our business to hit headlines and it will say first in County and or City to ever have a Bitcoin ATM and then it will talk about the services we provide at our business possibly generating interest based on the services we provide. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 10:53:39
yes our business demograph is exactly that. Which is why i'm even considering it. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:39:40
We are going to recommend against it and still say contact FBI. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 10:49:18
So would 5K be enough?
@_date: 2016-01-02 10:47:26
Yes I'm considering using a Bitcoin ATM as a service to advertise as part of my business. From what I can tell it's not profitable these days. However I'm not sure if interest in Bitcoin has gone down to the point that it wouldn't even generate any kind of buzz... It's like an expensive advertisement or sign... 
@_date: 2016-01-02 05:13:50
Bitcoin ATM. More so I get our business name in the local news as the first Bitcoin ATM in our area. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:41:10
More as a means to advertise and coolness factor for our business.
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:41:50
Yeah I know we will not make any money from it. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 09:35:07
I dont' think I worded my question properly. Where on the Internet can I see all IP information for my wallet that everyone can see?
@_date: 2016-06-11 00:59:46
I use bitcoin corE. Would you be able to tell me ip HISTory associated with my wallet address. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:03:09
Also with a custodial wallet my IP information is not revealed. For instance if I use blockchain to maintain my wallet online. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 11:38:16
Works for me...
@_date: 2016-06-10 09:32:37
@_date: 2016-06-10 09:33:51
Where was your wallet maintained?
@_date: 2016-06-11 00:38:31
it was a burner. hoW DO they track my IP to my wallet?
@_date: 2016-06-11 09:30:35
blockchain.info is that a good one, but I just read an article where an admin revealed a user personal info because he was mad at him. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 00:46:30
What about blockchain?
@_date: 2016-06-10 09:17:53
Where do I go to see IP log information that publicly available to everyone?
@_date: 2016-06-10 01:47:56
unrealistic... 
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:14:31

How does my wallet leak my private information? Why use TOR with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:59:59
I love this link. Especially given the fact I'VE BEEN looking for U.S. based exchanges. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 09:31:26
Is it possible to determine where someone keeps their wallet based on their address?
@_date: 2016-06-10 08:53:31
yeah the sms feature
@_date: 2016-06-11 09:32:35
what is a block explorer? 
@_date: 2016-06-18 11:40:09
I didn't say private key. The admin of the blockchain website has user info that is entered and he shared it with everyone because he was upset with the user. Where did you get private key out of that??
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:53:22
What's a Fud thread? 
@_date: 2016-06-23 04:27:19
As you can see everyone has commented what's on the webpage... I don't even know why your shit is written in Russian. Again it's on your end the website is working fine see everyone has commented on it. You're the only one that can't get to it. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 08:55:51
What do  mean name it?
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:01:49
1. I didn't provide a link 
2. I didn't say anything about Bitcoin my post was about a specific exchange.
3. Kraken had oversight in the Mt. Gox refunds so it's not too far fetched to think something fishy is going on with that exchange not to mention they haven't tweeted anything in the past 48 hours and their CEO is quite. 
4. It's unusal for an exchange this size to be down this long. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 00:47:27
what about when i connect to bITCOIN P2P network isn't my IP tied to my wallet then?
@_date: 2016-06-10 08:54:36
I didn't do the ID option just the SMS feature. Yeah the ATM had a camera on it.
@_date: 2018-06-23 09:38:52
Why are you buying something that's not really used in the real world? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:35:13
yes please and thank you. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:21:07
 But if I’m not mistaken you need miners for confirmations and it is still possible to make money mining 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:47:37
I'll play if it really works.

I'll try it if your a scammer i'll just pray for karama on you. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:02:42
.25 and it's yours boxed or unboxed. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:59:15
How do you plan on converting your Bitcoin for cash? To be on the safe side I would use an exchange like Coinbase. I would also cash out now. Don't be greedy. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:09:01
Where exactly did I steal it from?
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:02:38

You can either do it through:
* Ebay and of course pay for your purchase with Paypal (I've done it before)
* Virwox you can use this tutorial to show you how  (I've used this before)
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:44:47
okay so this asshole  blocked me from the bitcoin miners readdit for posting a how to link to buy bitcoins with paypal and I'm a big contributor and advocate to the Bitcoin community, so I decided to create my own reddit for miners. I created and posted a link to it on r/Bitcoin and I noticed it was getting down voted and people were talking trash, so I offered anyone that post to my sub-reddit I will pay them 1 BTC. At them time BTC wasn't as high. Someone actually followed through and I was obligated to pay. Trust me it hurt, but my word is my word.. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:16:44
The Virwox exchange loves Paypal and Paypal loves them. I've exchanged with them for months...... 
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:38:38
I donated..
@_date: 2016-07-06 02:59:15
WELP you're the only one...... 
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:47:46
np any time you pay back in conversion of USD what you borrowed regardless the value of BTC....
@_date: 2013-06-30 13:09:09
I've been considering starting a Bitcoin loan subreddit similar to:   &lt;---DO NOT post there the moderators will ban you.... What is the link to your loan anyways? You should at least post it in this submission... Or r/Bitcoinbeg
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:04:08
Don't forget donations in Bitcoin are tax-deductible... Bitcoins have an actual value just like if you were to donate clothes or stocks...
@_date: 2013-10-17 09:56:54
0.00000752 per minute but what I did was used the talkatone app with google voice, so essentially it's all data not my actual phone making the call. I just found this offer strange.. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:37:43
I disagree just I've sold $850 dollars in multiple ebay transactions from Bitcoins I've mined the past 6 months with my 10 GH/s setup that I've over paid for $500 that you can now get for about $200... Mine away man. PM me if you want a real miner to tell you how to make money...

I stop following what any of you Seeking Alpha "analyst say" You dogged Google stock in 2005 and said it was a bad buy. Even this past year before Google went ove $1000.00 you said it was a bad buy. You guys said Bitcoins is bad buy and now it had an all time high of 900.00

You can buy some on ebay, buy in person from someone (usually on craigslist, and online faucets. I goto this faucet site often:   to get free BTC. You can also do it in second life. Or you can mine with a block erupter USB stick that are being sold on ebay for less than 300. You can earn at least .01 BTC per day.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:53:22
Most definitely taxable when you convert anything into USD minus initial investment and fees etc etc.

uhh you can say the same thing about cash... If someone is asking you for a cash donation because their house burned down.. Then you gave them the cash and they just put in the bank to use for a rainy day then what was the point of asking for a cash donation in the first place.. JUST LIKE THEY ARE ASKING FOR BITCOIN DONATIONS BECAUSE OF THE FIRE....

I've sold at least 6 Bitcoin sales on Ebay and no reversals to date and I've yet to "meet" anyone that this happened to. Not to say it has ever happened or can not happen, but in my 6 Ebay/Paypal transactions I've yet to have a buyer do a chargeback... I've purchased at least a dozen Bitcoin transactions on Ebay/Paypal no issue...... Do you have any example of charge backs or are you just repeating what you've seen people say or are you assuming???

@_date: 2013-11-19 11:16:50
nope that at all.. Once you create an account click deposit with paypal and buy SLL and trade SLL for BTC. Takes less than 10 mins.. The only draw back are the fees, but if you need BTC in a hurry and less hassle and don't want to give some foreign exchange your bank account info well that might work...

I believe and this is my hypothesis here.... I'm not a tax lawyer... You would pay taxes on any gains you received so whatever gains you receive whether or not it's tanigable goods, cash, or virtual currency it has some type of monetary value and the monetary value gain is what you would pay tax on.

I'm confused on what your saying... Virwox is a virtual world currency exchange for people that play second life and other nerd games. You are able to withdraw the funds you deposit in your account (that you can deposit with paypal) in Bitcoins to a bitcoin address you provide. That website I provided gives you a step-by-step on how to do this, so I don't understand what your talking about when yo say scammers etc etc...

I'm assuming you are the village retard. It doesn't work that way whatever you lent you get that plus interest. So if the price goes up whatever that amount converted to in USD you still get that regardless of BTC jump....

looks like you only have 16 Block erupters which is about 5 GH/s. Depending on when you purchased/how much you purchased these you're in the red still and with difficulty at the current rate it is your barely "making" any BTC. Block eruptors are old news in the Mining community now..
