Someone with a lot of coins needs to do send their coins to another wallet as many times as possible. We'll beat Visa by tomorrow! Woo!

Fair point. I was mostly joking though.

On the other hand, Mt.Gox's CEO said that the document is more or less true after I posted this. He still claims it did not originate from Mt.Gox though.

On a related note, I think it's an absurd myth that bitcoin enthusaists are all libertarians. Bitcoin's most enthusiastic supporter in Congress at least is a [strong liberal]( that [thinks Obamacare doesn't go far enough](

Why wouldn't you have trusted them in 2011? The USD issues didn't start until 2013 if I'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:39:58
No, it didn't.

I just didn't expect so many people to jump on the bandwagon like this.

My h4x0r skillz aren't that good.

No, I think the most important fact is whether it's fake or not...

What? That's not the point. The point is it's at $240 on Gox while it's ~$600 everywhere else.

Anyone fell like explaining 25 January 2013 for me?
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:45:13
Yeah, I mean guns don't kill people, people kill people.

Bitcoin goes to $1 billion.. Satoshi Nakomoto becomes world's first quadrillionaire?

The best way to let him know about that rule is to message the moderators to have it removed.

...can I have 100K USD too?

By the time I got here the comment had already been deleted...

Thanks for the advice. I'm also a big believer in selling low and buying high.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:47:42
Yeah I see that all the time.

I tentatively think the current price is pretty close to the bottom, but that isn't the point. I welcome people making arguments different from mine, because I could be wrong, and if I am, I'd like to be proven wrong by someone. You're not that someone. You're either an asshole, an idiot, or some combination of both. Here's the reality: shit goes up. Shit goes down. You guessed right once. That makes you a guy hat guessed right once. But you're going around making claims like you're Nouriel fucking Roubini. Guess what: you're not. Take a step back and look at your post. You don't even give one reason for what the price might crash. And don't even think about mentioning lines of support again.
