Sorry if that came off as sarcastic or hostile. It's definitely awesome that you can pull a nice physical wallet together yourself!

There's a pretty big discount for packs of 5, and a 50% off code, LazzerLaunch for the first 100 orders.

I like how Apple is super confident that it's illegal, but not confident that's illegal in any particular place.

I've been reading this subreddit a long time, it was my main source of news while I was running engineering at Tradehill 2.0, so I'm really hoping you all like this!

Thanks for all the feedback, I dropped the price based on your comments.

These do look pretty awesome in a card, people have been very happy with the level of flashiness. Some people (including me) enjoy and appreciate the process of ordering stickers, downloading and running generation code, printing wallets, laminating them etc., but I think physical wallets should also be very accessible to people who'd rather not do that.

Hey, president of Lazzerbee here. We do sell them sealed, and we don't keep the private keys. For the vast majority of people it's just easier that way, they don't want to print their own or remember passwords. If you're well-versed in Bitcoin, then yes, you'll probably print your own, but these are for gifts for the uninitiated.
I had the same reaction as everyone else when I saw him open the wallet for the camera, except I knew they were funded, so I just started laughing right away.
Great job Matt!
