he did not invest in microsoft because he does not know how to use a computer even though he knows bill gates personally and bill gates advised him he should invest..he only invests in things you can touch he doesnt understand the digital world.

well sorry there was a time when gold price was volatile so what are you going to say ? that gold is a scam ? because of the buy high sell low strategy ? its always the stupid bitcoin never the brilliant human investment strategy right ? in 1980 one ounce of gold was 600 dollars in 1982 it was 300 guess it is a scam because people are to dumb. oh now its 1200 dollars.

oh no  i cant use bitcoin as a automated highly technological next gen smart contract having nutcracker which does 5000 things simultaniously ..i know you will say now well telephones are like that they have applications but the thing is 99% of people out there are there to make money and when they see bitcoin go up they will buy and do the same thing they did in december 2017. there is no such thing as oh nasdaq is getting replaced because of this and that crisis nasdaq is just nasdaq. i am no fool i know that you can do bunch of cool stuff with eos and other coins and personally i love ethereum but bitcoin is where all the money is going to go. bitcoin is not just the one coin thats kinda leading .. over 50 % of crypto market share. bitcoin is like that painting you see in a art gallery and say to yourself who the hell would buy this ? it literally looks like someone took a shit on it and it goes to sell for 50 million dollars. its a complicated situation. by the way i dont think at all that bitcoin is that bad that was just to show why people would still buy it. crypto currency is about money thats it. scaling will be solved. You are not the first one to say its over and when it comes to scaling these other coins are no albert einsteins its just about trade offs and what you want to sacrifice for speed.

if warren buffet had looked at his stock portfolio everyday he would have been poor too..all i see is bitcoin was 0,1 dollars now it is 3000 dollars i think thats not bad at all in 10 years. look at the chart of gold before etfs it had great swings but people have no patience if you look at it long term it is a great investment. The crypto market is an istrument to transfer coins and tokens from the impatient to the patient.
