I agree.  The run up between late November and mid-December has really skewed some thinking.

It's not generally, but this particular sub is more rotten with sexist bullshit than some of the other BTC and crypto subs. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:35:21
Same.  I switched over a few weeks ago after comparing 3 mo. charts.  Today is the first time in 3 years I'm holding no BTC and it feels odd. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:00:30
You wouldn't.  I used BTC as a currency until 8/2017 when holding it became more responsible than spending it. I don't want to spend it until I know what it's worth.

ETH is stable and increases periodically.  Ultimately, when crypto is adopted and used as currency we will actively prop up a few of them for different types of spending.  One kind of very large purchases, transferring funds, travel, day to day expenses.  It comes down to which tech is adopted widely and it seldom ends up being the best one.

Korea and Japan are using it as currency.

November.  I make about 4-6 purchases a year with it.  Stopped since it started shooting up tho.

Gemini exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:17:58
Your lesson should be avoid coinbase. It's terrible. 
 
Moving bitcoins back and forth between wallets and exchanges isn't cheap and is unnecessary.  My exchange is FDIC insured for all fiat held in it so I am perfectly happy letting it sit there.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:08:20
I get it, I get that the lambo talk is half serious, but why the fuck would you take money that is making money and pour it into something that is going to depreciate the second you sit in it?  Depreciate, cost cray amounts to insure, maintain, run and house. 
I think that if bitcoin can teach any of us anything is that spending on shit we don't need is something we should reevaluate. Fuck consumer culture that turns so many into credit slaves.  Save, invest, grow and buy an island or a house or an education.  Buy something else that will grow and you can't crash into a wall after a night out.

Once your ID is verified any money deposited via bank transfer is available immediately, which is nice. The interface is good, auctions, less volume so its not as chaotic as some other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:14:23
I kind of love this. It's great to see an entire country go all in and not feel the need to fuck with further.

You're a dim bulb. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:48:55
Gemini. They take some time to approve you but once you are verified any bank transfers are available immediately.  I also like the auctions. I'm not a fan of coinbase.  I'm one of the weirdos that uses bitcoin as a currency and coinbase believed I was spending bitcoin on illegal things, which I wasn't.  They shut my account but I'm happier with my wallet and gemini.

Korea isn't going to allow futures trading was reported a couple weeks ago.  That Korea is going to regulate something that the government is highly supportive of is good news.  Reporters think that the only safe way to write anything about bitcoin is to give it a sky is falling spin.  It's bullshit.

You'll have a receipt in your email that will let you know.

Then you should get in ASAP.  Home ownership can/will have many expected costs, but I you are a person who thinks they are up to it, get a place that has an extra unit or office you can rent to offset cost.  You can always NOT rent it out, but have the option if times get lean, or you want to build equity faster.

To get a mortgage you have to show that you have a few months of mortgage payments in savings after the downpayment is paid.  There will be closing costs, if you are taking cash for stocks there will be capital gains taxes.  Its amazing how little the actual downpayment has to do with buying a house.

Totally. A lot of FOMO buyers are pretty freaked out right now tho. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:47:35
No. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:24:10
Gemini. After they verify you it allows you to transfer money from your bank and makes it available immediately instead of having to wait 5 days.  Also actions. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:18:26
They cashed out a portion, not all.

Around 10k is a perfectly reasonable time to jump in if you plan on holding for a while.

Tax season might put the damper on that.

That was difficult to read and followed some logic that doesn't apply here.  I agree with the idea of having a point in which you exit the market or take out profits but the rest of it.. . . 
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:38:57
Most people pay taxes on April 15th, but some states automatically defer.  Still, spending tends to go down the month leading up to the 15th.

Gemini just hit 10050.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:42:20
Yes, safer to hold it.  It can be profitable if you leverage, but risky AF.

You can see volume by minute, hour, whatever across all markets.
