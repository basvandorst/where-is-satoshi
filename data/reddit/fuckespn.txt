Its not cryptsy, that address actually exists on Google Maps. You can easily see that building from the address they registered to.
[Moolah registered their US business to a non-existent address.](
According to Google Maps, [this is the closest building to Moolah's registered business address]( They incorporated in Wyoming, registered to Washington. 
I'm sure there's some good / logically explainable reason to do such a thing (they aren't based in the US, I suspect they use the "fake" business to be able to deal w/ US customers and have a US bank account) I was just being a dick.

While people may think porn is evil very few of them are *scared* of it. Everyone knows what porn is and it doesn't pose any harm to them even if they despise it from some moral/religious perspective. 
There are people who are very much afraid of Bitcoin because all they know is drugs/scams/hackers.
Chastising people for being ignorant of a complex and maligned technology will *totally* win them over. You come off as saying that because she is a pornstar she shouldn't be allowed to be concerned for her image. Really? That's the stance we're going to perpetuate here?

 [See comment]( on why I still believe most of what I said to be true of Bitcoin in its current state, but for a well intentioned reason to ignore it all. Just please, don't sell it like some 'get rich quick' scheme, which is what a lot of people tend to do. 
From consumer POV: There is almost none. Bitcoin sucks for general consumers ATM. Maybe saving 3% from Gyft? But given exchange rates, that may just come out to breaking even.
From merchant POV: No chargeback fraud. Plenty of companies that will convert straight to fiat, a decent enough sized market that is dying to find some kind of actual use for their coins.
Trying to get your friends to 'buy in' really just makes it seem like any other investment scheme. If one of them has a specific reason to want to purchase something in Bitcoin then go for it. But just trying to sign your friends up is probably a useless endeavor at this stage of the game, there isn't enough "consumer friendly" services out there, yet.
I don't know of a single product or service that has any incentive to be purchased with Bitcoin over regular, more popular, avenues currently in existence from a consumer POV. CC and PayPal both offer them more protection and ease of use. If someone knows of such a thing (maybe porn for anonymity??) then by all means feel free to correct me.
@_date: 2014-04-30 13:23:48
Yes, can you explain to me how that applies here? The address they are filed under **does not exist.** It isn't registered to some third party where you or I could send mail / correspondence to, its registered to fucking thin air. That house just happens to be the closest thing to their non-existent address.
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:06:56
It literally solves one of the hardest parts of CC theft beyond stealing the credentials: fencing the stolen goods.
Normally criminals make what, 10-20% of their fraudulently purchased items at the local pawn shop? And then have to risk finding a safe drop location. This way they keep 93% of the goods value.
With this both the drop location and the fencing of the goods themselves is solved. You literally have people ASKING the CC thief to ship them hot product.
And when the cops knock on your door I'm sure mentioning Bitcoin will *totally* help your case. LOL.

It is unlikely that any of those had a direct impact on our wallets that we could easily quantify. This does. Some people don't care about morality, they care about money.

I'd say it is for the same reason that the majority of US citizens aren't out there growing their own vegetables. It requires a significant time investment to ensure it is being done properly. There are a lot of technical aspects and resources required to do it right.
Is there some inherent flaw in our DNA that makes it impossible for everyone to understand and secure their own Bitcoin wallet? Well, no, but its just not worth it. **I'd venture to say we will see "Chase Consumer Bitcoin Accounts" before we see mass adoption of individuals controlling their own wallets.**
There are plenty of people who are savvy with Bitcoin can hardly protect themselves. Or are we pretending 600M didn't just shit itself into oblivion? I've seen numerous exchanges/entities crash and burn and bring "informed" Bitcoiners down with them in the few short months I've been learning about digital currencies. You seriously think Joe Plumber is going to be able to protect his wallet.dat file?
Hell, as it stands bank account phishing is a lucrative field, and those actually provide the consumer some protections. But yeah man, I'm sure Joe Plumber is totally ready to have his "eyes opened" and get rid of that to "be his own banker."

But as it stands, how is bragging about raising less funds for a campaign - especially when there is more $ overall available to BTC market- something to be proud of..?
I continue to "invest" more $/resources in BTC than Doge, but hot damn if I don't see some of the silliest content on this subreddit in relation to the two.

They made it very clear from the get-go (it is even in the rental agreement) that they only take checks. AFAIK, there is nothing illegal about that.

Quick Google Search:
23% are too young to have their own credit card in the US. 54% (majority) are under the age of 24 - as a rough estimate hoping this site is even remotely accurate. 
So you're right, the majority of Twitch viewers are still old enough to technically open a bank account. And I'll even spot you the fact that they also probably have $5 to toss away every month subscribing to a channel.
That still does not solve the biggest issue: **buying into BTC to subscribe to a stream, even if it is an option, is still a gigantic and pointless pain in the ass for all of them.**
Let's say Twitch offers them to pay in BTC: Why would **any** of those people use it versus just plugging in their CC details?
Breaking News: People who have BTC desperately want business to accept it so they can use it (or so it will go up in value). The weather forecast? No one else cares because its just a pain in the ass for everyone.
Stop being evangelists - start making this currency easier (and attractive) to use for the insane amount of people who don't have any. Big businesses aren't just going to throw you a freebie very often. The sentiment on this subreddit is that they all should. Overstock honestly spoiled you guys rotten by the looks of it.

I fully agree with that sentiment. And I think its a worthwhile investment for merchants to make. I offer everything I would get in "savings" on my site for BTC purchases because, IMO, if in 5-10 years I never have to hear of PayPal again that will have been money well spent. Or not really spent, but not hoarded into my personal bank account.
With that said, *most* businesses only think of the "now" profits, so good luck convincing people to give away money now so someone else can make more in the future. I just happen to be young enough to where it'll also benefit me even if it takes 5-10 years to catch on.
On top of that, look at this subreddit. The prevailing sentiment is "oh my God why doesn't *every* business accept Bitcoin its *so fucking awesome*" .. No the fuck it isn't. Truth be told, it was hardly worth it to even set up my Bitpay account, and no business who isn't already invested in Bitcoin should realistically look into accepting it. Hardly anyone uses it yet, relative to every other forms of payment I accept.

I have no debt to my property management company. If anything, they're in debt to me since I pay for the entire month up front. They provide me with a place to live, I pay for it.

You children are ridiculous with the "OMG ITS MY RIGHT TO PAY IN DOLLA DOLLA BILLS" crap.
I'm an adult, the people who own the place are adults. They asked if I'd be alright writing them a check every month so that the poor girl behind the counter wasn't being inundated with tens of thousands of dollars on the 1st of the month making her a prime target to get robbed at the end of the day, I said alright that's cool.

Ok, but that means there are *independent [ie, no team]* League streamers who get more viewers than a SC2 tournament. League tournies break 200k viewers easily.. Just at a 1:1 comparison its not really close. I've seen NB have 50k viewers just playing solo q.


Uh, ok. This is all entirely speculation. I can say the exact same thing of the LoL community. Like you have 0 proof of this. I've gone to websites I have absolutely no interest in that I saw pop up on Garry's stream too. Ditto for other popular LoL streamers like Trick and Nightblue. Those dude's viewer bases are passionate as hell. Bonus: you can market BTC to them as a way to increase their donation amount. Twitch allows PayPal donation links, I doubt they'd ban BTC donation links. I think it'd be more than worthwhile investment to get these individual (but hugely popular) streamers into the BTC economy.


This I was unaware of. I missed that thread apparently. Its fine by me, I don't have any $ invested in it was just curious why someone would pay for what I can see in the image.. Which is almost unrecognizable even to someone who goes onto @_date: 2014-04-01 09:26:50

That is my point - this isn't required with this setup. You can ship **directly** to the person's home address through the wish list. Meaning the product gets sent straight to the drop location and the thief has no need to go there to interact with the stolen goods. 
NewEgg requires shipping to the billing address. Subsequently, NewEgg can't be used with Brawker. Amazon Wish Lists can be shipped to an address that is **NOT** the billing address, and as such can be used here and this services adds the *incentive* for CC thieves that otherwise does not exist to abuse Amazon Wish Lists.

FWIW, I think there are a whole myriad of reasons why they should consider accepting it. There are certainly a lot of reasons why **I** began accepting it. But they weren't the focus of my original replies :)
I like the discussion, if you're not too offended I'd like to break your ideas down a bit - I type furiously and cuss like I sailor and I'm so so sorry I know I'm overly rude on the Internet lol..


Agreed with the lag issues. Azubu doesn't have those lag issues but has still been unable to capture a solid share of viewerbase. They also did exactly as you stated - offered a major brand (CLG) more money to come stream for them. Still hasn't worked out.


Your premise is that a streamer can't accept Bitcoin without Twitch? I have said **multiple** times that every streamer should consider adding Bitcoin donations. And Twitch clearly does not forbid this or care to take a slice of the pie as it stands. Does this put some onus on the streamer? Sure, but so does practically everything about streaming except the distribution platform - which is all any streaming service is really going to offer. There is **no reason** for a streamer to even want his platform to handle their Bitcoin donations - in fact that is the very opposite of what they should want as the service is surely going to take some cut of it. Right now they can have the best of both worlds - Twitch is basically their CC processor and takes a cut in return for the best public promotion currently available **and they can accept BTC w/o Twitch taking ANY of it.**
Believe me, I certainly see the benefit for **streamers** to take Bitcoin - but I still don't see it for **Twitch** relative to other things they could do.
I just think its a totem pole, smaller businesses need to start taking Bitcoin first. I feel like we've just gotten ahead of ourselves on the scope - I agree it offers tons and tons and tons of both theoretical and practical "pros" for a variety of different people/businesses - but I just don't see it for something the size of Twitch right now.

I simply took the dollar amount in the title ($21,000) and referenced it against the only Dogecoin campaigns I'm personally familiar with (doge4water - $30k, Sochi - $30k, and yes the NASCAR thing at $55k could or could not be included). I can understand excluding it on a 1:1 comparison basis. It wasn't a heavily researched or historical price analysis of the donations because its not essential to my overall argument (that bitter, resentful posts on either side are stupid, but especially so from BTC's side).


And I believed that entire charade to be cringe worthy.


Good, fair points. Again, I wasn't presenting a super hardcore argument for the Doge vs BTC debate, because I believe there should be no debate. I can agree to all of those things being as factually correct as my limited knowledge will allow.


I have very rarely, if ever, seen these opinions expressed **and upvoted** on that subreddit. I tend to spend a majority of my discussion time in because I find it far more palatable than this subreddit, and while I'm not saying those things don't get said - I have yet to see them become a *popular* opinion. Unlike the anti-Dogecoin (and alt-coins in general) sentiment that is a staple here. I regularly see posts on the frontpage of calling everyone to be more "Shibe like" (ugh, lol) to Bitcoiners and be as respectful as possible to their "father currency." I cannot recall a time in my last month or two of activity here to have seen a similar movement. If I've missed it, I'm open to being schooled =]
I have seen, however, and will address the fact that there is a growing demographic of the Dogecoin community who thinks that "insane" Bitcoiners are bad for crypto's mainstream acceptance. I share those beliefs. I'm sorry, I know Bitcoin was at some point founded on the backs of people who truly believed it would bring down "the man" but those days need to scurry on along.
I am a merchant. I deal in nothing but $ - cold hard cash. Bitcoin (or any mainstream crypto, I literally could not care which one makes it) will save (and thus make) me TONS of $. When I come to this subreddit and see some NSA terrorist infiltration manual up-voted to the front page I die inside.
Honestly, no matter the subject this subreddit acts as if it is a fortress besieged on all sides by an invisible enemy. It rarely opens the gates (there was a post that managed to hit the front page yesterday that said as much, ie, this place is not newbie friendly). This isn't productive for mainstream adoption, and it is an attitude (reflected in the OP I replied to) I intend to continue to petition to see corrected. Until then, is a fantastic proxy for newcomers and shouldn't be degraded for no real reason. The biggest detraction of is that it is filled with frolicking idiots. But at least they are warm and receptive, if overly foolish. I truly believe if China banned Dogecoin you'd see them raising money to fly the entire Chinese government for tea and cookies at a water slide park to talk it over before calling for them to be overthrown.
I'm sorry if this post is overly antagonistic, since that is the very thing I'm preaching against.

There's no reason to offer **a very small percentage of users** a wider method of payment.
Have you seen Twitch chat? ~~The majority of viewers at any given time aren't even old enough to own a bank account - how do you think they're going to get Bitcoin? Convince their parents that magic Internet money neither side has ever heard of can buy them a subscription.. That PayPal (as shitty as it may be for Twitch, it is **great** for buyers) can also offer and is far easier for their parents to read up on / understand / trust.~~
*Edit:* This was hyperbole, and I've looked up some stats that disprove the concept. Sorry for that, the fixed sentence should be:


Let's say Twitch offers them to pay in BTC: Why would any of those people use it versus just plugging in their CC details?
Twitch has absolutely no reason to accept Bitcoin. Individual streamers, on the other hand, should definitely accept Bitcoin donations.
I run a purely virtual business that honestly reflects a portion of Twitch's viewerbase. I recently went Bitcoin only for a weekend - it was **terrible**. I hate to break this to you, but hardly no one is using your coin in real marketplace setting. It is entirely niche at the moment.
And thats OK. I've kept Bitcoin as a payment method, and included a sweet discount because as a seller nothing would tickle my sweet spot more than for PayPal to die in a fucking fire and for Bitcoin to rule the world. But as it stands, Bitcoin sucks dick for actual marketplaces - even in niche environments you'd expect it to do pretty well in. It hasn't been adopted by buyers who don't have a *specific* reason to. Its just an extra step of hassle.
For Twitch.. The userbase who would only pay for a sub in Bitcoin is probably completely nonexistent. Most people who have BTC and also want to subscribe to a streamer are just going to suck it up and do so through PP. Thats just how it is. Again, individual streamers should for sure accept BTC - because this community is generous with those who support it - but I guarantee Twitch as a company sees that dynamic as all give (free marketing) and 0 profit.
**Edit:** I want to make something clear here - *most* businesses have to actually start taking a loss on Bitcoin for it to become what every Internet seller in the world wants it to be: the death of PayPal. Everyone here who is saying "Bitcoin will save business money if they adopt it now!" .. you're crazy wrong in most instances. The only way I can get someone to use Bitcoin (who doesn't already have it, which in my 120k/yr market is less than 20 people during a **busy** weekend) is if I reinvest the saved PayPal fraud and put it into customer savings/discounts. Bitcoin **sucks gigantic donkey balls for customers.**
Again, everything I do is virtual - you have no idea how many times PayPal simply bends me over a table. They do it as often as they can. A $4 order incurs a **$20** fee for every chargeback. And my goods are unrecoverable from that. I net a $30 loss **minimum** on every fraudulent PP charge. And I have had **verified** PayPal accounts whose **verified home address** was "[23 Poop Lane]( .. To which the PP rep said "oh that must be a glitch in our system"... .... Yea PP can go die in a fire, and I'm happy to eat a loss on BTC orders to help make that happen, but a lot of people on desperately need to pull their head out of their backsides and look at the reality of this system in its current state.

What do you consider 'temporary'? If Bitcoin has no value, do you really think all that expensive hardware is going to be donated "to the cause" at no charge? 
A 51% attack on Bitcoin is the absolute end of any of those political dreams of "liberating the masses from their government overlords." Miners are not going to mine for nothing, and you can be damn sure every Tom, Dick, and Harry who watches the news (and is already probably skeptical at best of Bitcoin) is going to be laughing at the idea of it for decades after.

* It is smaller than 1,000 bytes.  
* All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.

You can be charged for anything. Some banks offer free online billpay, others do not. Even if they do, getting someone to give you their bank account info in order to set it up isn't easy and some places may still refuse it as a payment method.

USA. Its definitely a thing here: [Plan B Pill](
Big with college kids who get drunk and forget what condoms are lol. Have to consider contraception is kind of a "hot topic" issue from time to time in our oh so progressive country, so there's a fair # of people who not only know about it, but probably already have a mixed bag of feelings over it. People confuse it with an abortion pill all the time (despite the fact it is not such a thing).
I have absolutely no hard data on how many people would recognize the Bitcoin symbol in order to distinguish it from the contraceptive pill.. but just reading "Plan B" brings that to mind, not BTC lol. And if we're targeting the "oblivious public" my gut says going with something else might be wise haha.

I think this is something that will come with time and more mainstream adoption. Are big investors pouring money into things like Coinbase nowadays really anarchists/libertarians who want out of government en masse? I don't think so. I'm sure as hell not, I was introduced to digital currencies through Dogecoin and thought it was a cool way to trade online. I had no idea this was some anarchist cookbook thing to a lot of people until I went from Doge to BTC and found Will there always be elements to Bitcoin that can naturally be used to circumvent government regulation / restriction? Sure, but they're not going to be practical for the average person any more than BitTorrent is to the average person to read leaked NSA documents. I have seen the [sentiment expressed on reddit]( that it is unfathomable to people that - despite all we know the US government has done to its people's privacy - [that the people haven't "risen up."]( To me, it is unfathomable that people looking at it from the outside don't understand that - despite all we know the US government has done to its people's privacy - they still think we're just going to "rise up" against a government that honestly doesn't do *that* badly at providing its people with a comfortable existence. 
Also - how little the *majority* don't care about their privacy. It just doesn't affect their day to day lives in any meaningful way. They all give up those rights to privacy to post pictures of their afternoon lunch on FB / Twitter / vine / instagram anyway. Very few people (even fewer with any real power) live in a condition worth rising up over in the USA. We're not a fucking third world country with no clean drinking water. If the price of pissing on a plush toilet is some anonymous government agent peeking into our nudie pics, *most* Americans right now consider that a fair trade. Honestly, the government isn't libertarians biggest opposition group, its all the people who *just don't care.*
There is a very passionate anti-government group on this subreddit who furiously downvote everything that isn't revolving around "sheeple waking up" - and that's fine. They're welcome to do so and quote all the awesome authors in their home library. I'm just gonna hang out and wait it out until more people show up who just think this is as nifty as I do. At worst, they turn out to be right and I can be a member of Bitcoin early-ish adopters anyway. Woohoo!

Being wrong happens. Wasn't the first time, wont be the last. Whenever I type the address into Google nothing comes up for me. Even the maps didn't actually point to that house a week ago when I first did the research, and I don't think of a house as a place to register a business.. Seems dangerous in this day and age, with random assholes being all up in your junk posting your front porch onto reddit. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:52:56
Did you even watch your own YT video..? LOL. You're either incredibly ignorant or you don't even know how the service works that you're advertising.
Edit: Also, the claim that you can spend money "anywhere" on the Internet is bogus. NewEgg, for instance, has policies against this very kind of thing because of the implications. Trying to get them to ship something other than to the billing address of the CC being used is pretty hard last time I tried to order something there (~1 year ago).
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:23:17


I'm sorry, Libertarians, but Bitcoin is no longer your dream child. It isn't even "decentralized" anymore - [GHash controls 1/4 of the network, and 3 pools combined are good for 52% of the network]( This is straight up fact, at some point you let it get away from you as your poster child for decentralization. You can't blame any government for that and I have no idea how anyone with a straight face says Bitcoin is "decentralized" at this very moment when 3 pools could collude to kill the value of the project right now. 


[Yea, totally, man](
[This thread]( puts the current estimate on a 51% attack if you were to BUY MINING EQUIPMENT at a measely 180M.. As if we as Americans don't piss that away on a single fighter jet.
Feel free to bury this in a sea of downvotes, but I don't understand how anyone claims Bitcoin is decentralized and uncontrollable today. I don't doubt or deny that there will be a day when the network is so large that it will out scale current governments - but there's no way you can say that is true today.
If you want to liberate the world from their government overlords then go ahead. Be my guest, I really don't care, but at least be realistic about where you stand on that front.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:45:25


Absolutely yes! ..*In an ideal world where Bitcoin has become mainstream*. Again, I deal in this market, I cannot stress how much it ruins my day when I have to call a parent and explain that their child is the one who "stole" their credit card and has now cost me $ that I want to recover. Be realistic: how many other parents in the world right now do you think do what you do? Do you think its enough to where someone at Twitch should put even .5 seconds of thought into the process they would have to set up for it?

~~You forgot to mention that their [US business registration in Wyoming]( is regstered to a [completely non-existant address](
~~[Here is a picture of Moolah's US business.]( Its a shack. I've said as much on this subreddit and before. has drank the kool-aid and even have rules in place on the subreddit to prevent "calling out merchants."~~
[Offensive and wrong]( 2/2 today I guess, gonna go hang out with Donald Sterling. The address isn't indexed by Google, doesn't come up on any home value searches or anything else I usually use - but its apparently owned and lived in by one of Moolah's employees/partners.
@_date: 2014-04-12 05:41:51
I never said incorporating in Wyoming is an oddity. Incorporating your business at a completely non-existent (ie, **fake**) address is what I don't understand. Again, I speculated there was a fine and dandy reason for it, but I don't know what it is.
I can't use their exchange with a fake address, so I find it odd that they're allowed to create their exchange based on one.

I thought I was losing my MIND the first time this happened to my business. Someone who didn't know what PayPal was just submitted their credit card info (EVERYTHING) on our contact form. I was like NO NO NO NO NO hahaha. I use PayPal specifically so I don't have to be at all responsible for CC data, don't want that stuff delivered to my personal e-mail address. But it still happens pretty frequently.. Not weekly or anything, but I'd guess once every other month or so.. Which is more often than I'd ever expect someone to **email** their credit card details.

Assuming they're nice enough to send advanced notice? Sure, you're right, that's a good way to handle it.
But making that assumption is silly at best. Given all the anarchist crap that gets spread around the Bitcoin community (like this article) I doubt it is going to get posed as a question. It'll likely just be a "we're done listening to this, project over" kind of deal. And we've been kind enough to package it into 3 convenient targets instead of the hundreds, thousands, or millions it was *supposed* to be in that fantasy decentralized utopia.

I'm being serious. As a layman, I don't understand how you can propose Bitcoin survives a collapse of the dollar when its price is entirely tied to the dollar.. Will we just redefine its value based on something else? What?

But the premise behind the technology would have been proven untenable. 
If you can kill the biggest beast in the pasture it isn't hard to either make the sheep compliant or to send them off to slaughter as well. The idea that Bitcoin is some magic idea that governments can't actually squash is delusional. At present the price of effectively killing Bitcoin as a libertarian movement is $180M flat, or less if any government capable of doing so is willing to just hijack the three biggest pools. Or any mixture/combination in between.
The article's premise is that "governments shouldn't try to regulate Bitcoin because they can't stop it!" - that's wrong. They could turn off the lights tomorrow and find a coin to back that wont produce stupid articles like this one.

Most people don't write their apartment manager a bad check, because he knows where you live and can pretty easily have you evicted.
As far as *why* they prefer them to cash its simple, they accept a gigantic influx of $ on the 1^st - 5^th of every month. This would make them a prime target to be robbed if they were always paid in cash during those times, so a lot of apartment complexes opt for checks / money orders / less liquid forms of payment as to not have their receptionist held up at gunpoint every month. Even in nice neighborhoods if a criminal from some other part of town knows you accept $20000 in cash on the first of the month, well, its likely an easier mark than a bank.

Big ol' discount double check.
Again, I just saw the post specifically targeting SC as a place to go to start some Bitcoin based business and didn't understand *why* a place so resistant to change would have specifically pro-Bitcoin (a very new technology, not particularly useful to most of the state).
Turns out, it didn't and its just a dumb luck reason. But I don't see why its hard to understand the origin and motivation of the question. **Its not a specifically political one**.. SC happens to have a bunch of old people and farmers, neither group do I see being gigantic Bitcoin proponents to list it as a "destination state" for Bitcoin versus any of the other options.

Again, the problem is not people who already have BTC. Of course you'd be tickled by the option to pay with BTC. Duh. That's not the point - the point is that people here just don't seem to grasp that - honestly - we don't matter right now. 
The concept of this post is silly. No, Twitch should not consider Bitcoin because Bitcoin has **almost nothing** to offer Twitch **right now**. It has a lot to offer individual streamers as a donation method **if** their viewerbase happens to have BTC users, but there is nothing that BTC offers Twitch that PayPal or regular CC processing doesn't already cover.
I really think we have no concept of how small we are. 113k total subscribers to That means at max we represent .2% (not 2%, **.**2%!) of Twitch's monthly unique visitors. And we both know good well not that many of us use Twitch, but its a incredibly rough ballpark since I have no idea how many overall Bitcoin users there are, just rough logic I feel like its a favorable figure for BTC.


..please tell me you're joking, because unless I'm mistaken - right now the average person cannot get Bitcoin without entering that info to some exchange at some point anyway. If you think its a pain in the ass to enter your CC details to Twitch - what do you think the **average** person is going to think of entering details to exchange -&gt; wait for approval (Coinbase took me 2-3 days to approve my bank account without giving them my online login credentials[this is sketch as fuck by the by]) -&gt; convert Bitcoin -&gt; send to Twitch's address.
It is unfathomable how people don't understand that this payment method really, really blows for people who don't already have it. And the people who already have it are, in terms relative to the market's we're talking about, **no one.**

And then how is your receiver going to get it into their local currency? They're going to have to sell it and likely take a loss on market rates. There is no existing way where you can usefully send BTC as a remittance service.
Sure, in theory its possible. But it isn't currently practical so can we stop acting like it is. Wow, you just sent $50 worth of BTC for $0.25.. Congrats. Unfortunately its fucking useless to whoever you just sent it to unless the markets work in their favor.
Coinbase currently has a $3 bid/ask spread, + $0.15 bank fee + 1% Coinbase fee + 2-3 day wait for deposit. There's the rest of your fee difference compared to Walmart's new service. And there's a Walmart damn near everywhere so you're not waiting 2 days for Coinbase to move the BTC to your actual bank account.
I swear to God as much as the trolls are retarded the rest of this place is just delusional.
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:29:06


The average human is neither interested in or capable of being their own bank.


This is ~~insanely untrue~~ in many instances a needlessly misleading "sales pitch." First of all, in order to get any BTC you probably have to buy it from an exchange (which charges you a fee), and then there is still a fee (albeit minuscule) to send a transaction (unless yours coins have sat idle, leaving you open to the very large volatile risk inherent to BTC at the moment) last I looked. Either way, it is not very often not "free." Will it be cheaper than using WU? Probably, but say that for God's sake, no need to lie.


So true. It can just crash like a 2 ton brick ~~at the whisper of a post written in Chinese.~~ because right now it is still very new, and very volatile. You can still lose tons of money using BTC, let's not act like it is some all powerful savior from all things evil, please.
