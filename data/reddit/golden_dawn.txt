Okay, this is not really believable at all, in my opinion. I'd say your only hope of avoiding prison, and it's a slim hope, is to credibly prove that you're literally retarded. Perhaps the jury will have sympathy.

Breaking news often has a live thread created where the the news comes from a variety of sources, including police radio channels, pics from twits on the scene, and more. I would say those live threads are probably one of the best sources of breaking news that currently exists.

At most, you'll have to wait 9 minutes. I think this is subreddit dependent, as I often have to wait in some subs, while being able to comment freely in others. When I have a delay in a particular sub, I just save that waiting comment and the whole thread in a separate tab, and move on to other posts/subreddits. Come back every 10 minutes or so to post one of the delayed comments and at 6 comments per hour, you'll soon get caught up.

It seems that when you look behind the scenes at most bitcoin enterprises, there is some kind of scam or super shady shit going on. This Roger Ver character is a convicted felon who, among other things, stored explosives in his apartment in a multi-unit building. Also made promotional video to assure skeptics that MtGox wasn't going to steal all their money.

It's not like that *at all*. And I don't have to come up with a competing analogy for yours to be terrible. 
A very small percentage of people are wanting to engage in transactions where they have no recourse. Those are mainly people engaging in illegal activities, or a member of the very healthy bitcoin scammer community. Anyone who is not one of the above is probably (Analogy alert!) like a mark wandering around at a carnival.

@_date: 2015-09-30 02:07:14
$75 - $300
Assuming no major changes or "dramatic" events. There are too many people both financially and emotionally invested for it to easily drop below $75. On the upper side, the *extremely unprofessional* presentation of bitcoin to the public over the past 5 years or so has guaranteed that most of them view it skeptically, and pretty much 'do not want'.
Verdict: It will continue limping along, roughly as it has been.

Bitcoin has a lot of potential, but the unfortunate influx of the criminal element (and the Guy Fawkes mask crowd) probably ended its chances of becoming credible. *Now*, it's more interesting for the fringe element promoting their scams and anti-authority feelings. Bitcoin could still be a great thing, for certain purposes, but it's currently more useful for identifying criminals and subversives. Lots of reasons to keep it on the radar. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 01:55:31


Like it or not, he deserves it because his user name is in the top position. This means the subreddit essentially belongs to him. If this is unacceptable to you, either discontinuing your use of reddit and/or bitcoin will entirely solve the problem.

Agreed, but as someone else pointed out, there actually aren't 5 or 6 heavily upvoted comments calling him a shill, along with every other name in the book.

As if such a thing exists. Sorry, but there have been hundreds of similar posts. Many of them with much larger losses. All kinds of reasons, but the net result is total loss of funds. 
It's always, "Well, if it was *properly secured*, it would be impossible to lose", when the definition of "properly secured" = bitcoin not lost yet. So many people have posted over the past few years about doing everything exactly right, but the funds/bitcoins are just not there. It's time to accept the fact that there are numerous points in the process where it can all just disappear.
