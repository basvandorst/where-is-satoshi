The police is not allowed to ask, and the company is not allowed to disclose private data. 
Even a government agency is not allowed to disclose such data. Only a court order would allow it, with the necessary minimization procedures.

So you are saying the police can decide who is a criminal and who is not? 
In a lawful situation only a judge can decide that, not the police.
And the best interest of the company is to protect it's business and clients, not some police agency. Germany has privacy protection laws and both parties ignored them.

 gives a short overview on the german privacy law, which explicitly mentions public authorities of the federal states.

Several laws were broken.
First the german "Grundgesetz" (constitutional law), and then the cited BDSG.
What the police can do is ask via § 160 ff StPO as helper for the prosecutor, but then still the company is required to demand a court order or official prosecution request to protect its private client data and not violate the BDSG and the Grundgesetz. What they only did the first time.
In Germany even supposed criminal have rights, and violating these will not end well in court.
The company had only two options. Either they must offer the data, or the are not allowed to offer the data. There is no grey area in between.

... or following the law (anymore)
- see e.g. the travelwarning to Bavaria (
or if you are pregnant: 
freedom of press is also seriously overrated, with the major organs being pure government propaganda outlets.

Thanks. Unbelievable loophole

but the police operated above the law, and bitcoin.de probably also.
if you follow the german law, you wouldn't be allowed to ask for such data without a judge backing it, and you wouldn't be allowed to hand over this data to police without a judge's order.
