What would be something that would make it obvious to you that the bear market is over? 
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:42:32
Isn't it the other way around? I mean if many people think something will go up in value, many people will buy this thing, resulting in this thing actually being worth more.

I think the banks in Switzerland are doing something similar with TWINT. Free, instant person-to-person and person-to-business payments, but of course all controlled by a central authority... I don't like this development. Where people used to exchange money by the means of pretty annonymous cash, they are now doing it via TWINT (yay surveillance!). They also seem to have started blocking a few select people I know ("drug people") from using it and it's pretty fucked up for them. I really hope the people will realize that full surveillance and a central, all-powerful authority are just not the way to go at some point and switch to a better alternative

It's actually been there for quite some time. I remember getting some bitcoin there as early as aug 2017

r/Monero has pretty good discussions. Of course the majority of discussions are not about bitcoin but they do have some discussions about it and the way money works in general.

I think bitcoin's biggest problem is it's lack of fungibility and privacy. I think that if these problems are not fixed bitcoin could very well fail because of them. Privacy could probably be fixed fairly easy (to have basic privacy at least) given enough time but to make bitcoin fungible, pretty big consensus changes would need to be made, and considering how difficult it is to successfully hard-fork bitcoin, such changes may never be made.

You will see the value when your exchange gets hacked and your kyc info gets leaked together with all your trades from the past few years. If btc price has risen significantly by that point, that probably isn't such a favorable scenario

Yes bitcoin was designed to do irreversible transactions requiring no trust. Else there would need to be someone deciding wether a transaction reversal is approved, but who would be given this authority? If you really need strong consumer protection with btc, it can be built on top of that using the irreversible txs as a foundation.

Can't have Monero's privacy with the current bitcoin implementation. Allthough bitcoins code can be altered, seeing how hard it is to change the consensus this level of privacy may never be possible to have on bitcoin

Except now your VPN provider can see all your traffic instead of your ISP. If you really want to browse privately you need to use Tor
