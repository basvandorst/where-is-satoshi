Still a few hours to go...
Hopefully some fireworks still to come

If a long or short gets liquidated, then the orders need to be covered.
Also OTC desks connect to multiple exchanges and can offload large volume into exchange order books at the same time if their isn't enough natural flow.
And as other people say, lots of bots trading

They are ok now they accept bitcoin again instead of BTrashCoin

It would just prove he had the keys, which also could be lost, stolen or given away, or controlled by a few multi sig participants or just being kept safely until the time is right, which may be never.
Evidence of absence is not absence of evidence as a wise man once said.

Said the white guy...

And by bitcoin he means permissionless electronic cash folks.

Well, youre technically correct but it isnt a big deal  to solve
You shouldn't directly send prefork bitcoin to a third party because of the replay risk (they can broadcast the same transaction on the other chain and get both)
So send your BCH ( or BTC ) to a new address in a wallet you control before onward sending
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:43:46
On what basis did he make his claim.
Knowing a number can't be illegal, which is your private key to access network value.
Many jurisdictions including the US have accepted the bitcoin network under a regulatory framework, it's not a security, it's currency.
The issues are for traditional governments- it encourages freedom, immutability, free speech and is relatively hard to control and pretty much impossible to stop by design.

60m isn't low volume for otc, minimum ticket sizes tend to be 50-100k.

Not really lightning developers.
Proof is in the pudding.
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:44:50
Technically you're at risk of a replay attack if you sent your coins from one chain to an address you don't control.
@_date: 2018-06-07 04:07:29
I know a number.
Its a private key, that controls access to network value
Where is the asset held exactly - in which jurisdiction?
If someone else sees my private key and moves the value to another address on the network, have they stolen the asset?
If I give my key to someone, have they taken joint title of the asset?
If I lose my private key, and the asset becomes inaccessible, can I write it off as a tax loss
What if I remember it later?
How would the asset relate to other digital currency in another layer like tether or lightning units

Greed vs ideology.
Regulations allow institutional investors to access the space = moon (at a hidden cost)
Ideology - you're bang on.
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:31:05
Power consumption/ transactions. 
Maybe time to rethink increasing blocksize.
The tradeoffs need exploring.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:45:48
Absolutely

Get a wallet and send him a small amount to show him it's real, like less that 1c to show the power of it.
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:04:56
Does anyone have an active user count though?
Some accounts throwaway, sockpuppets or unwanted dissenters might still show up on subscriber count 
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:58:34
It's also built on litecoin.
It's a mistake.
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:25:06
Well, they got noble bank to approve them which raised eyebrows in the industry.
But... what was pumping ethereum iota and eos
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:21:30
I'm a throwaway and ride both channels btw :-)

Doesn't this have something to do with a t-shirt Adam back used to wear
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:14:03
What if it was a loan or profits made from shorting futures, after money was printed.

The obvious place to start is mastering bitcoin by Andreas antonopolous.
@_date: 2018-06-17 06:12:03
Just think for yourself.
Think independently.
I'd advise you to hold on both chains because you keep your options open  and take less risk than backing one.
It's not about ideology.
Dan Krawisz has some great views on this

Except a lot of people just learned something by paying attention to a giant random number generator. Odds of that happening are pretty crazy.
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:01:39
I'll keep monitoring it, maybe in a few years I'll be ready!
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:59:04
Not bitcoin.

Scratches chin
Sure 
@_date: 2018-11-11 12:16:48
You can use the public address to see if the bitcoins moved at any point
@_date: 2019-01-05 05:06:21
Yes some exchanges share or remarket liquidity on other platforms. Its a bad idea for an exchange to do this, because of the time delay between matching engines and counterparty risk often customers funds
@_date: 2018-07-01 10:39:19
Wrong, it's still not enough
