I agree.  A strong message needs to be sent to this company and ANY company that doesn't have bitcoin's best interest in mind.

Nahh...truth is you don't care about bitcoin.  You just want the price to go up no matter what.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.  The price will go up the more bitcoin is perceived to be valid.
If you don't think one group controlling greater than 50% of the bitcoin network is a problem, no one can help you.

Good...then the threat would be known.  We should boast like nuts, piss them off and make them show their hand and true colors.  Otherwise, do we really know the enemy?
Your way suggests we placate them so they can trick us and make us simply feel better.

Everyone that posts on negatively about bitcoin is really a sad person.  They are actively hating something.  They seem to have so little in their life that hate is the thing that keeps them motivated.  It's a weird community.

It's not that people like to be scared of shit.  We're afraid all the bases aren't covered.

The point is they are LOSING money because of their behavior.

The price isn't going to go up until this is resolved.

I'm not comparing bitcoin to diamonds.   DeBeers did an unbelievable job in popularizing something that wasn't very popular.  The same thing was done with lobsters if you check on the history there (people use to equate them to bugs).  Bitcoin certainly needs the public's interest.

is for assholes that are trying to stop bitcoin.  I've seen you actively trying to dissuade people from using it.  You sir, are a class A dick and I will ensure everyone knows it.  I am going to start identifying all buttcoiners that come here to actively promote against bitcoin.

What's this bullshit?

The point is to create a stable, effective network.  Ghash miners are irresponsible and the market is responding.  If they continue the price would be driven down to zero and they will be rewarded with bankruptcy since the bitcoins won't be worth enough to pay off their equipment costs.
There is stupid greed and there is smart greed.  They are being very, very stupid.

Tell that to Coinbase and BitPay.  They've already started to advertise.  Guys like that stand to gain the most.
Money relies on the confidence game.  The public must have confidence in bitcoin for it to work long term.

GHash.io is still at 42%.  I hope the price drops to zero until GHash.io is the smallest pool.  Miners and everyone involved with bitcoin deserve this for not taking care of the problem with their actions.  
I'm sorry but for some things to happen there will always be an element of cooperation needing to trump greed.

There is no way to enforce it but if miners all decide to drop pools that do this permanently,ie put them out of business, we would see some major changes.
They are a bad actor because they should self-impose this limit.  As they approach 50% it scares the market and discourages adoption.
