wow, this is a really cool contest, thanks for that! I will use it next time when someone questions safety of BIP38 in my presence

Hi, organizer here: I invite all of you guys, whether your technical or not, you're going to have a blast at Makerland with workshops like "Underwater Robots", "Hacking Hens Hapiness" and 16 others. Also John Biggs from TC, Kate Drane from Indiegogo, Jason Huggins from Saucelabs, Mike Swift(just some of them) and a incredible athmoshpere. If you don't believe me check out the last conference we organized:
We deliver.
If you're still not sure.. read this
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:56:55
don't get us wrong, we're not let down or angry, we just want to improve if maybe eg. 
1) there is something wrong with the way we embedded the button for example.
2) We should not use coin base widget but something else, etc
We just lack the knowledge you guys have, and this is the reason we're asking here.
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:28:00
yes, we're looking for a right size(s) and form factor, this is the reason we're showing our idea at such an early stage, we would like to build something that is seriously useful out of the box
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:00:38
Yes, thanks for this feedback, the thing was - it was impossible to configure GUMROAD with bitcoin so I found this work around..

I added Bitcoin payment, Ola wrote the blog post, it's a mistake in the blogpost. We have configured the site for selling book a week before the day of release, so adding "bitcoin payment" later is actually true. The thing - it was still before the release.
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:42:18
If you watch the whole movie (90 seconds), we have a plan to put a hologram on the other side of the box with a unique serial number. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:28:05
So what? It's an international conference, it's not that much to come to Poland, and you can find a really cheap hotels, food, beer here.. :)
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:17:08
we have just received 0.017 BTC from someone :) Thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-17 12:28:08
Hi, we're working on the mobile pos, do you have some documentation (drafts works too) in place? We had some ideas of our own for a protocol like this but would love to implement a standard you're pushing
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:53:07
Feedback about the price is really important for us, thanks
Yes, we do have a pdf template on which you can print, we're working on improving that
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:30:19
yes, the potential in this is HUGE, is there a way to follow the project apart from Github repo?
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:02:46
For once, you can use our solution to enclose non-encrypted private keys too. You do it yourself, AFAIR casascius coin owners had to trust the guy who created them.
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:49:47
Thank you for your help and time!
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:49:08
Is it still on or was it a time limited contest? Could you please send me a link to this discussion?
BIP38 is extremely safe, the reason we're asking here - is we're not sure our idea is valid in this form and with this assumptions. Thanks for taking the time to contribute!
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:41:15
Hi, Agent we were thinking about this, it would be to expensive
Having 4 copies in 4 different locations will save your private keys from fire :)
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:38:57
and another 0.025BTC, you rock
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:30:10
A hologram with unique serial id on the other side of the case.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:43:28
Thanks, this will pretty much do it
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:44:57
We haven't thought of that :)
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:06:46
Since this idea requires oracles - take a look at open source oracle implementation - Orisi Project at github.com/orisi/orisi which is already capable of running frozen coin

@_date: 2014-06-03 17:38:20
Thank for your feedback! It's appreciated, weird - this Coinbase thing
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:21:27
+ waterproof.
But yes, from a logical point of view it's an envelope with a seal.
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:50:06
Hi, author here, actually the donation button was there from the day one
@_date: 2014-10-17 12:45:35
This is the problem with banking system in US, it is very very old and sucks. 
In the country I live - Poland it's totally different. Every bank here has it. And you know what? Bank transfer costs 0.3$ at most, no matter how much you send. This makes me "worry" about Bitcoin. No friction here.
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:44:19
We plan to have it waterproof as water is a biggest threat to paper wallets. 
Fireproof would be to expensive to produce.
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:25:20
Thanks for your reply! We were thinking about 0.03 - 0.05 BTC per set of 3 cases, but we would like to hear from you guys what price is ok
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:18:00
there is really no need. you can have a plastic bag and a tamper resistant hologram and it will do the work. 
I don't like my coins to be pieces of paper in a plastic bags. I want something more.. rigid, tough.. don't you? if you're fine with paper in a plastic bag that this is not a product for you, and it's ok too, right? :)
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:24:45
hahahah, nice one!
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:14:08
yes, principle stays the same :)
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:27:59
we will! :)
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:23:43
 Thanks, your feedback is awesome! I especially like "disclaimer for gf" part 100 bits
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:28:49
We can make them, but would you use them? For what? How often? How many of them would you need? 
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:25:48
yes, it is waterproof, this is one of the most important features
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:19:03
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:28:37
thanks! I guess gift-giving is one of the powerful usecases!
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:05:36
thanks for your feedback, we do not plan to produce "shit" :), we want this to be something that has certain quality. Though we're not attached to our pricing, we will adapt. Also engraving unique serial numbers on every each one of them will make this more costly.
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:15:39
Sure, two usecases:
1) COLD STORAGE
- waterproofing your cold storage. 
- making it more rigid/physical - less likely to be thrown out by accident. 
You encrypt your cold storage with BIP38, you put copies into 3 Galaxy Wallets and distribute it geographically, so one is in your house, one at your parents' house and one is let's say at your father in law safebox. If your password(bip38) is good, your coins are very safe anyway, but this way you can say if anynone tried to tinker with your wallet etc. I would move my coins if I knew something like that happened, even if my bip38 password is very safe.  
2) Nice way to give someone BTC
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:34:19
as long as spacebucks can be encrypted as a paper wallet, yes! :)
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:03:17
thanks for taking a time to reply, this is the kind of info we're looking for
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:19:20
Thanks, we will contact you
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:10:14
Actually, I have good news for you, 4th prototype works with  we may end up producing more than one version
And thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:22:15
This was our original idea. It seems though that 3d printing quality (e.g. makerbot replicator 2 quality) is not enough to produce user experience and safety we're looking for. We may end up giving out some version of Galaxy Wallet for free as a STL but it won't be comparable at any level to the injection mold quality
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:11:35
Thanks! This a really really early stage, but we believe in getting feedback asap, this is why we're here!
@_date: 2015-01-09 16:55:32
This is a fake, created just to harvest tips. Do not upvote.
(I am from Poland, no such conference has taken place, this is just a photoshop scam)
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:27:36
no they won't steal your money since you encrypt your wallets with BIP38, right?:)
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:25:19
the problem with usb sticks is.. there is no standard size :(
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:59:17
thanks for the kind words!
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:57:41
It wouldn't work since it would be easy to check on the internet how to open it in a correct way.
Better: encrypt your wallet using bip38 so you don't really care whether anyone see what's inside. 
Important thing is you know whether you need to move your coins or not. That's the goal of "tamper proofing"
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:25:02
:) happened to all of us, no worries
I think.. there is a video of inserting the paper into the wallet, exact moment:
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:24:36
this would be very expensive and I am not really sure you need it since your suppose to have another copy in a different location?
@_date: 2015-01-08 13:28:25
so you would rather have a case without safety features but for multiple usage, right? You're actually the first one to say that.
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:46:52
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:43:24
Thanks! This is just a prototype. We were trying to show how "generic" the whole process is, but you are absolutely right!
