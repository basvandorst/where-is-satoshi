Bitcoin doesn't care on what "state" you are. It's safe to follow that advice, yes. It's also ok not to follow it.

Well, a bunch of them are leaving Bitcoin for Ethereum, so I guess if that's what you want it's working pretty well.

I mean it wasn't as bad as you though. They just kept "loosing" my multiple snail-mail (cannot do online requests, how retarded...) requests to add a wire recipient (Kraken) to my account. That is until I got upset and suddenly they have added that account.

Everybody has an agenda. I think the block-size issue is complex (when it comes to understanding the potential outcomes of each solution), hence I'm happy to read what everybody is saying to form my own opinion. I must say I'm a bit at loss when the opinions of two people I personally respect and "trust" (Mr. Hearn &amp; Mr. Sztorc) are at odds. Being a complex issue, I wish we can keep this debate very open and may the smartest outcome win.

XT being an alt-coin... Mais que fait la police of r/bitcoin?? I no longer wonder what is best for bitcoin, now I wonder what is less worse, larger block-size or censorship? Choice has never been that easy.

@_date: 2015-08-20 09:33:59
That's one way to see it. The way I see it is vote for censorship or vote for a simple and fair fork. Nobody is pushing anyone to install *edited*, also calling *edited* a trojan horse is maybe a bit propaganda? Everything is properly documented as far as I know. I am supporting *edited*. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 18:46:55
*To me*, bottom line is:
- Just like all censorship on Internet, the one about of bitcoin-xt on r/bitcoin is helping the promotion of bitcoin-xt.
- The division of people pro and against the block-increase is driving people to Ethereum, hence negatively affecting both sides of the isle.
- Somehow, we need to vote the admin position on r/Bitcoin.
Let's stop the non-sense and be productive and nice to each other or is it too much to ask.

That's true in most cases. But in some cases people print the QR code of their private keys (right-click, open image in new tab), in which case it ends up in the browser history. This scenario isn't so common but not far fetched either, and since it's relatively easy to correct, I think it should be.
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:17:05
Bitcoin isn't about faith, it's about math. 
When someone protected by the core devs is censoring 80% of the community, then 80% goes away. Get rid of censorship, restore balance. It's not all about programming in life, it's also about human interactions. Watch Silicon Valley if you're lost.

I didn't know the URL was also encrypted with TLS, thank you.
Now aside from a replay attack, indeed my other concern was with the browser history. It just seems unwise to have the private key displayed in the URL when I would think it is relatively trivial to encode it.
I will report this, thank you.
@_date: 2015-08-30 07:41:31
Interesting, thank you. Then I wonder, why use the testnet for "production"? Should a "test gone bad" happen on the testnet, it would then cripple Drop Zone somewhat, no?

I would think nobody needs to go away and all perspectives are worth sharing. With the exception of pro-censorship individuals (-

Should a post be created suggesting people to pledge they will move to if does not accept to make a vote for a new admin by a certain date?
If he accepts, then great, otherwise most active users would unsubscribe from and move to as they would see the number of pledges.
The reasoning being that is I'm currently in a position where I'm actually not sure where most of the bitcoin community users are posting, hence I'm staying. If I know most people would leave by a certain date then I'll move along.
@_date: 2015-08-13 07:23:49
Mr. Hearn, I agree with you on the block-size issue. But please follow Mr. Sztorc recommendation of using a 90% consensus. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 08:12:22
This might help then:

That would be nice. However it can prove complicated when some people get confused with the definition bitcoin hard-fork and altcoin.

@_date: 2015-08-20 15:38:29
tl;dr I'm seeing two possible outcomes here:
1. Core makes the necessary adjustments to stop censorship and regains community trust.
2. *edited* gets 75% sooner rather than later.

Same boat. I'm thinking the bids listing are only represented through the "stats" tab, each small circle being either a sell or a buy? I just placed a fairly small sell order below market price half an hour ago but not much happened so far.

Looking at this post, it makes me wonder two things:
1. Who is NOT using Mychoicecorporate?
2. If everybody uses Mychoicecorporate and for any reason they go down, I imagine it would affect all bitcoin debit cards..?
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:18:27
I don't think anyone is saying Xapo is not a good business. It would simply be better, if like Bit-X, they would disclose how they calculate their buying/selling rate. Actually Xapo is good, 1.5% is relatively reasonable. I'm a bit more at loss with E-Coin's rate.
@_date: 2015-10-04 17:59:20
Fees calculated by comparing the rate used by both services with the rate displayed on Bitstamp.
More specifically, because the rate displayed on their website is the purchase rate, here I am referring to the selling rate. To be more clear, since both services are functioning differently: that is the rate used when I make a card purchase with my Xapo debit card, and the rate used on E-Coin to convert bitcoin to euros/dollars.
Both services have great potential. But I find it very unfortunate that while they are transparent on every other fee, they keep this one completely in the dark. Not exactly in the Bitcoin spirit.
@_date: 2015-10-04 20:31:22
Who is complaining about that cost? Personally I am complaining about the lack of transparency.
@_date: 2015-10-04 20:58:36
Ah yes everything is clear with Bit-X apparently, I am trying to find that same information for Xapo &amp; E-Coin.
@_date: 2015-10-05 17:39:53
"all fees are mentioned on the website and you get exact amount is shown on the screen"
The problem here is that many people, including me, are under the impression that the price you display is not something that is being decided internally but reflects the market price. So, to me, unless prove otherwise that's possibly a lie by omission.
Again the way I have calculated those discrepancies is
- Xapo: Buy something, look at the rate used and immediately compare with largest bitcoin market (bitstamp).
- E-Coin: Do all the steps to convert bitcoin to local currency and compare the rate offered with the rate of the largest bitcoin market (bitstamp).
Those are approximations as I don't have the time to replicate every day to see how things evolve or what not, especially as my point isn't about so much about the commission itself, rather the lack of transparency.
All in all, to be very clear, I mean no harm to your business by sharing my experience. As a simple customer, what I hope is simply for things to improve.
EDIT 1: I just want to add that the whole point of bitcoin is that it's never supposed to be about trust, or if trust is involved it is kept to a minimum. Not sure if my message conveys well so I'll give you an example that says it all: 
EDIT 2: The point where you say that you do not have any hidden fees is like the point where you say that you get the rate that is mentioned on the website, both statements are probably true however if you don't disclose your method of rate calculation we will have to rely on trust and that's not exactly what the community is looking for, I believe.
@_date: 2016-05-19 09:27:37
Rootstock is smart contracts for Bitcoin. It has nothing to do with replicating Ethereum's DAO. 
OP is asking if we are interested by having something similar for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-04 20:16:39
Overall I like their service. But yes there are a few areas I would love to see improved, starting with seeing the details of the transactions on the mobile app maybe? Can't wait to receive the Bit-X and compare.
@_date: 2015-10-04 20:56:29
That's definitely a start. But then it is 0.5% on what amount? We need to know how to get their initial bitcoin price. Otherwise we are left with a not-practical comparison of what they make us pay versus the rate on the very much used bitstamp.net, in which case I personally end up not with .5% but 1.5% difference. Hence transparency would probably do a lot of good.
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:39:22
DISCLAMER: I'm a consumer of both services, I am only sharing what I am experiencing. I am looking for a service that I can rely on and use long term, that is why I take the time to understand you and your competition as well as I can.
FACT: When I use your service, I am observing that the rate you are using for me to convert bitcoin to fiat is about 3% higher than preev.com. That value is 1.5% for Xapo. What gives?
CUSTOMER EXPECTATION: When one decide to use your service, one make sure to be ok with your fees and one assumes the bitcoin price reflects the global market value (AKA weighted average of multiple markets / preev.com, coinmarketcap.com for examples). If a percentage should be added to that then be it, Coinbase does 1% commission and I am happy with that.
PROBLEM: You define that price without being transparent on how. That price is not aligned with the weighted average of multiple markets.
BIGGER PROBLEM: Essentially tomorrow you could use a rate of half of the current value of bitcoin, that wouldn't go against a non-existent definition on how you calculate that rate. So how can a customer feel secure with this scenario? 
SOLUTION: Be transparent. Use weighted average of multiple, defined markets. Make bitcoin community happy. 
We do not mind paying for a good service. BUT WE CANNOT ACCEPT LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.
EDIT: "so please stop misleading people here and accusing well-known services" 1. Freedom of speech, 2. by your logic, apparently accusing well-known services is not ok but accusing lesser-known services is ok. that's deep man. 
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:32:37
Good point. But if one player (such as bit-x) can make a positive improvement by making this rate calculation transparent , the others should probably follow.
I mean I have been using Xapo instead of my bank credit card for a while now, but that single fact will probably make me switch to bit-x. Because 1. it's cheaper and 2. to show support for players trying to do things well.
@_date: 2015-10-04 20:32:10
Wish I would know how to do that. Help?
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:47:37
I think if that is designed to be a transition from the regular banking system, it would be good not to follow their shady hidden fees. I would probably not mind a fee that is publicly stated by the bitcoin card service, but again hidden fee is kind of a red flag by my standards.
@_date: 2015-10-04 21:15:10
My understanding is there are no commissions on bitcoin card purchases for as long as those are made using the currency of the card ( The rate used to convert bitcoins to local currency is the current exchange market price, which is available here:  .
Edit: That 0.5% appears to be for trading though. But maybe they see a bitcoin card transaction as a trading operation? I would think not but it would be good to have this clarified.
@_date: 2015-10-04 20:30:17
By "old" I suppose you mean there is no way to get those now? Ideally to drop my bank's credit card, I need to make sure I have two fully separated services (using different vendors).

Looks pretty cool, I will check it out thanks!! Any downside or TIWIK to share with this one?
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:53:05
I am just trying to find out what is the best service so I can use that one. So far it appears bit-x is being more transparent than their competition. Actually I have only heard today about the bit-x card and I am happy r/Floooge suggested it here.
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:59:22
Nobody really. But the point isn't about the guy, is it?
@_date: 2015-10-04 20:26:53
Would it change anything either way? I don't mind the question, but I'm really only here to express my frustration with this lack of transparency. Not sure if you are using such card but wouldn't you be frustrated too if you would notice that you are paying 1.5 to 3% above market rate and that percentage is not mentioned anywhere? Reporting this seems the right thing to do so things eventually evolves in the right direction. Besides, like I said I think both those services have great potential.
