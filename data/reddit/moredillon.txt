BTC network has been spammed or filled in some other way for a while, and continues to be pushed down/outbid by more expensive transaction fees. If you know how much you spent per byte for the transaction you can follow it here:

It's in a co-op space in the Mission, which is now a retail space shared by many artists and startup shops. Nakamotos is a strange collections of individual products that you can buy with bitcoin, for less than retail price, showcasing purse.io.
When I visited no one was manning their booth, and the ATM/BTM was not operational. But that was months ago. 
Apparently they have a Lamassu on top of the bitaccess machine, which would probably be from a separate ATM owner (hopefully providing rate competition)  
Give their business line a call to make sure someone is around when you visit.

It isn't a lot of space compared to other things, but giving up 25GBs of space on your boot drive (for OS X) has made me switch to MultiBit (light client) until I upgrade my internal boot from 120. I really want to run a full node, I want to support the network, and it is a pain in the ass for me. 
I am a tech savvy person who cares a lot about bitcoin. For anyone new to the game, total turnoff, huge yeild sign, and possibly a dead end: most will turn to centralized bitcoin services.

Probably all/most ASIC producers. Maybe running them before shipping out, probably pushing out miners to highest bidders building mining farms. The only way to control or get a lot of bitcoin besides buying at today's price. It's less about controlling a large part of the mining network, more about the consistent and reliable return. It's one of the worst parts around bitcoin that has been supsceptible to greed in this way. I hope the people that are trying to capitalize in a major way get some sort of karma downfall. I hope that karma doesn't impact me as a small time miner.

cool intro to bitcoin by the same dudes 
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:26:53
The current 'magic internet money' ad works for public awareness. It is lighthearted and funny, which bitcoin has steered away from in the past few months. That mantra has been adopted and embraced by the dogecoin community. It is not as informative and current as it should be.
This subreddit has evolved pretty oddly, the long time fanatics have seemed to dwindle or spend time in smaller isolated core sites and bitcointalk forums. 
is a major start point resource for exposure to the community of bitcoin, a jump off point alongside A place for discussion and reposting for all major happenings and news stories. Focused topics filter into other subreddits and the fragmentation is detrimental to the main page content, reducing it to somewhere between a newspaper section and a tabloid. Either people get caught up in small details and hot leads and don't paint the right picture of the community as a whole, or the community has changed with the value of BTC.
The advertising needs to change, but could be way more effective if the identity of is identified and focused first. We should take a hint from the leading bitcoin evangelists, and tone down their message to something less preachy and end-all. If we could focus on the real world solutions, their progress into mainstream awareness/acceptance, and the problems that need to be addressed, might be a better resource for all.

This is the problem. A call to action needs to be identified and focused.
The ad needs to incite learning more about the technology. This is a tall order, but is the only thing we should be asking for. Probably not going to get much traction asking people to motivate self-learning, but might get a spark going for some and increase bitcoin presence in daily discussion.
The ad should be smart. It should be half PSA (*this is what bitcoin is*), and half inspiring futurist fun (*this is what is now possible, and currently happening*) Nothing that can easily be linked with scheme type behavior (financial gains etc).
The last step should be crowdfunding for placement and ad costs.
There should be a street art side of the campaign that is non-destructive and easy to DIY.
The first step is a crowdsourced script and concept.
Bitcoin needs a brand guide, distilled down to an easy to follow website with downloadable simple resources (vector logos etc) and things to avoid.
Placement coverage should be diverse, but targeted to tech minded plebs, people that are excited about new technology and consumer goods. Placement focused mostly on TV and billboards with some internet.
This ad has huge potential for a first of its kind nature. 
Bitcoin is everyone and no one.

I love what they are doing. It's not only an excellent case study for cryptocurrency, it's also a stark reminder of where Bitcoin lies in the public default world. It is still very fringe, forgotten, dismissed, confusing, abstract, and generally not applicable for most people. 
Once people get it, they get it. Getting there is the hard part. It's almost impossible to instill curiosity in people. 
Still not sure just giving people bitcoin is effective in the right way, but I know it would inspire me to play with it I were at that point of entry. 
While aquiring bitcoin has changed in difficulty; from creating a wallet on alpha software and trusting sketchy foreign sites with bank accounts (or depositing cash into a strangers physical bank and hoping for the best) to now signing up with a known trusted entity and typing in a credit card number, it is still something you have to really really want in order to jump that barrier. The more casual and easier it gets with all the new tools, the smaller that barrier gets. 
It's three steps: curiosity, learning, and aquiring. Flipping that last barrier to the front has a fascinating effect. Keep sharing with others.

Seems odd to see a brand new product/service somewhere like Facebook without seeing it pass through the general Bitcoin community channels at all. Looks like it is a user driven global indexing/rating system for bitcoin addresses. I wonder who/what is driving this site? And who might be interested or represent the target market?
Playing up the long term price gain of bitcoin as a marketing ploy for your service is cheap, so is 'free money', and don't get me started on the picture. Bitcoin needs PR, but the companies spending money on advertisements are filling up the space with odd visual interpretations and scammy slants.

It is a good idea to not trust these from the start, because if they go down or get hacked, your btc/money is probably gone. If you don't control your keys, security is outside of your control. However, it makes it a lot easier and *if it is worth it to you*, it is nice to offload that concern. It is best to use these services to hold small amounts. Also- **diversify** -I don't trust any one thing with everything.
This community is full of people with razor thin or absent trust. But it is because nearly everyone here has been burned before. We are cautious for a reason.
EDIT: Talking about centralized wallet services here. The normal wallets on coinbase fall under this banner. They offer a multi-sig option (where you both have partial access to the wallet) as well.

The 3d clipart look is not done well enough to be convincing, it looks wrong (it looks like the effect was on the B and it was attempted to follow); make it better or lose it and make it flat. It was another thing that caught my eye and took me away from viewing the page as a whole.

Use the highest level of scrutiny when thinking about trusting yourself. Also, with trusting others (services). If you are using a computer, make sure it is secure and not infected (especially if it is a PC)
Cloud/web wallets are not a bad idea. **Know the difference** between centralized (coinbase, circle, coinkite [when they have access to your keys]) and not/de-centralized (rushwallet, hive, blockchain.info,) and shared/multi-sig (copay, greenaddress, bitgo) wallet providers.
For the love of god, use two factor authentication when you can. Simple passwords do not cut it anymore.

Running a full node or even bitcoin core does not appeal to people below the fanatic level. This may be the fault of ASICs being developed (lower/null mining incentive), the high space requirements, the high bandwith requirements, or the *sheer complexity*, it is a **pain in the ass** for the layman/laywoman. 
It is a passion project at this point; a passion based non-profit on the super-user (sub miner) level. What normal activity or community requires such high level complicated time and money and space expenditures? 
I really want to help contribute what I can. I mine with 7 units running 24/7 *at a loss* in SF. I run 5 more nodes on top of that (I thought they were full nodes, but my ports are not open). This really should not be that difficult. The bar is set so high to participate and help something I care about.
There needs to be more lay-people involved in the development side, but it is pretty hard to enter as such. Do I need to learn basic coding and how to use github to help fix this problem, or hang out on some obscure chat board waving my hands in the air? That is a problem in itself. 
This discussion needs to continue.

VR will continue to flop without a lot of good content being created. The Oculus and the Vive have incited a lot of people to start working on VR projects again. We may see another flop before it really takes off, but the VR breakthrough has begun! Right now you need a really decent PC and expensive hardware (if you aren't using a phone with headset) to access most content, and that content is difficult to access, not organized for consumer consumption yet. So there are some barriers. Lots of room to innovate on, no one is doing it quite right yet.
I would highly suggest the Vive if you are thinking about it. Totally worth it. It might take a turn for the worse once walled gardens start happening (esp. if apple gets into the space, i.e. the app store or itunes music store)

The balance for the coin? If it's unopened it should be 1 BTC still. Which is ~$6k. The coin itself makes it worth a bit more because its a collectors item at this point.

Curry Up Now (Mission) 
Valencia Street 659, San Francisco, CA 94118 - The staff are generally untrained and no one seems to have the password to the app/api/payment gateway they use
~~Ramen Underground (Japantown)
355 Kearny St Ste 530, San Francisco, CA 94118~~ 
-They stopped accepting BTC. I was the last person to ask before they wiped the logo off their window last month. Damn shame, great ramen.
I haven't been to these, but they are the only other restaurants on coinmap.
Sake Zone (Richmond)
1115 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118
Bamboo Asia (Financial District)
Montgomery Street 41, San Francisco, CA 94104
Nara Sushi (Nob Hill)

People do need to spend more bitcoin (you can always acquire more asap). 
I always seem to surprise the staff/waitstaff of the stores/restaurants I go to. The issue is they are not trained or do not know the credentials to log in on their POS(point of sale) system. It ends up taking much longer than it would have, and usually the whole experience turns sour for both parties. 
A passive physical QR code based system with a small digital notification system is needed. I would be happy to build it with someone. Coinbase hackathon anyone?
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:26:06
It would be possible for that one address to distribute to a slew of addresses on the back end, some sort of retail fog. 
Alternately, a new QR code could be generated/printed out/displayed every week/day/transaction/etc. However, that would require more electronics for what it might be worth - a dedicated phone/tablet just for BTC transactions is just another piece of gak/junk to clutter up a POS site. 
I think the transparency is okay, because for now it won't encompass all/much of the transactions. There is no way of knowing what the full amount or relation is.
Right now, integration is clearly the route we need to go. Coinbase and BitPay seem to have this down and in their sights. The whole password/training hurdle is the big issue. This is a supply/demand thing. The bitcoin community need to use bitcoin in an increasing amount their purchases.

I had the same experience when they opened. No one staffing the store. The ATM was powered on but non-functional. The experience took the wind out of my sails.

How many of those are actual day to day consumer interfacing shops? I could count the SF restaurants that take bitcoin on one hand.

Round the block and back again
That's the miner's way
Faster, faster, faster, faster
There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're rowing
Or which way the price is flowing
Is it highing, is it lowing?
Is a goxicane a-blowing?
Not a speck of hodl is showing
So the danger must be growing
Are the fires of finex a-glowing?
Is the grisly bearwhale mowing?
Yes, the danger must be growing!
For the lowers keep on lowing!
And they're certainly not showing!!
Any signs that they are slowing!!!

I would say coinbase (or any other U.S. Regulated bank type exchange) would be okay, even if your sources are through an 'illegitimate' source, it's coming from people's personal wallets in small amounts. So it probably won't red flag as anything too fishy with Anti Money Laundering laws. However, if it is all coming through a singular address (like if xotica receives micro-payments then pays you through their own accounting system) then you might want to check with coinbase or circle customer support if it would be a problem. If xotica payments come to you through different addresses each time, I wouldn't worry about it. 
I am surprised to hear xotica doesn't provide info on this, it sounds like useful information to their user base. You should ask their customer support too.

Looks like you can add a debit card, or bank account (routing/account number), or credit card (which will charge a small extra fee). The options are in settings, under 'cards and banks'.
Click around the site and read their FAQs and stuff. Start small, in case any confusion errors happen. Once you feel like you really understand their system and interface, jump in.

Such a thorough, well thought through answer. The AMA proved unnecessary after the first post; but an ongoing discussion on these topics would be interesting to follow. I am sure there is one out there somewhere... 
Pretty eye opening and kinda frustratingly obvious that the burden is put on the Service Providers and their interpretation of the hard rules. I respect the 'personal beliefs are often at odds with "best practices"' line, and appreciate the transparency and diligence.
Were your AML/KYC program staff and technology bought out of house, like as a service, or did Kraken hire/build one internally? 
Identity is an interesting field. What are your thoughts on 
I saw you at one of the SF Bitcoin meetups about a year ago. Keep Kraken going strong! Thanks Jesse!

Well aware of this. On there for convenience and for trading. Depends how much I'm trading at the time, but I try to keep less than 5% in non-US exchanges, and 10% in US-based exchanges. I don't have a lot of capital, but I'd probably keep less of a percentage if I did. Thanks though, it's good to keep these general warnings public.
