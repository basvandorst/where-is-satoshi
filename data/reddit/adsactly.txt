I believe the Low IQ People have already been weeded out and now there are just a few misinformed people involved with BITCOIN and Decentralized Block Chain Technology. We plan to share our Knowledge about BITCOIN, Decentralized Tech and Smart Contracts to anybody interested in learning.

People BITCOIN should be used to Fund the Development of NEW and More Secure Technology that solves everyday issues in the world.
Smart Contracts, Smart Banking, Smart Property eliminate the need for the LEGAL System and we can all finally go back to being Lawful and Living on the Land where computers do all the fair judgement.

You can Always Rewind the Blockchain oh wait Transparent Forging hasn't been implemented yet.

This is ADSactly the kind of people we want to shake hands with and do BIG Business together. People who see the DOLLAR is DEAD or is on its way out and the New System will be Distributed Banking Networks that are controlled by the people not the Oligarchy!

This is an Excellent statement made by 


I thought it would a good IDEA to post this again for those who still don't realize the revolution in the fiat money markets worldwide.
I don't know about you guys but I don't like the fact that Central Banks Print money out of thin air and loan it to us at interest.
With BITCOIN nobody can print it out of thin air and for those who say "You can mine it tho" Think again the Mining Difficulty has increased exponentially since December of 2013 when I first got involved with BITCOIN.
I suggest you BUY at minimum $100 worth of BITCOIN even if you don't understand it.
You will thank me in the future when the FIAT Money Markets Collapse under the weight of BITCOIN and Physical GOLD and SILVER Pairing!
Mark My Words BITCOIN is extremely undervalued and if you miss this boat you will kick yourself I Guarantee you!

The Main Function of this Group is to create Awareness of BITCOIN and help support businesses and merchants that want to accept BITCOIN.
@_date: 2014-01-02 14:39:23
I don't see why people wouldn't want to support this kind of project I am going to do it with or with your guys help. The People that help us make this a reality will be rewarded greatly potentially for life.

ADSactly could easily be made into a Decentralized Exchange that would have a Reputation System and Point Exchange system that could be used to exchange BTC, LTC, PPC, FTC, NMC for Starters and we could easily grow to accept any form of payment because everything would be P2P as you suggest above and we could even share dividends with the people who help Fund this Project.
I am the Owner of ADSactly I believe this is something the entire Bitcoin Community Needs and I believe we can provide that with ADSactly with help from the Bitcoin Community.

People that want to learn more about BITCOIN and live in Canada can meet with many great people in BITCOIN World. Anthony Di Iorio is the Founder and I believe its a Great Resource for Canadians to connect with BITCOIN Savvy People to help expand there products or services to the Market Place or if you just need some help with Mining, or Buying Coins.

Good Question How can you help. We are looking for people that will help us Find People in the Crypto Community. Posting on Forums to get people aware of ADSactly The Ultimate Society which is where the Decentralized P2P Exchange will be developed and built.

You people need to WAKE UP what Ron Paul said here is FACT BITCOIN is not MONEY and we should never try to push that fact... Are Trading Cards Money? Of Course Not however do they have a value Attached to them because there is only so many made of the certain card?
Yes for example Magic The Gathering Cards are Very Expensive for the Limited Print and Tournament Cards.

The Question is. Why can't you cash a Large Check using your Phone. The money is printed out of thin air.
The numbers on the check verify your account balance and it seems to me this is control tactic by the Banks that we will destroy with BITCOIN and other Crypto Commodities!
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:33:46
I Agree with this statement and I believe that more people are catching on to what BITCOIN and Block Chain Tech can do for them!

OK so I did something Stupid even tho I have FULL Security turned on. including TOR Blocking and you telling me I made a mistake.
@_date: 2016-09-29 23:18:02
OK Well Somebody was able to HACK into my Account With a Very Powerful Computer.
I had TOR Block Enabled.
Everybody Get Your BITCOINS out of Blockchain.info somebody has found a way to get access through a backdoor to Blockchain.info Accounts.
This is a Very Serious Problem that needs Attention by the Security Experts in Blockchain.info!
@_date: 2016-09-29 21:29:16
Yes I know this but how could they gain access to my PC without me noticing I want on the PC the whole time. Between the hours that this happened.
I would have seen the person controlling my PC. Also I would have been able to find the Logs showing which IP Address logged in to my Wallet. For some reason Blockchain.info is refusing to provide me a FULL IP Log of my Account Access.
@_date: 2016-09-30 16:59:57
Yes it is they had control of my funds and there is no email saying the another device accessed the account and no IP LOGS!
@_date: 2019-09-07 23:59:40
We used RED-E01
@_date: 2015-09-18 22:53:18
Find people you can Trust that already have BITCOINS and Buy them off them with whatever they are willing to accept for it. Whether it be Gold, Silver, Dollars etc. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 19:24:31
OK well looks like I should start getting a little bit more active here. We are putting together a Decentralized Cooperative Economy and we need some help perhaps you might like to be involved at one level or another.
Contact us on Skype if you interested in learning more
ADSactly is our Skype ID

You Raise some interesting Points however I believe we really need to stop looking at BITCOIN as just another Currency and start treating it like exactly what it is a Simple Ledger Entry. The same Ledger Entry that Accountants have been using for over 2000 Years. The Only Difference here is BITCOIN is Decentralized and Open to the Entire World Publically for everybody to see ALL of the Transactions on the PUBLIC Blockchain!

WOW this is Incredible News I can't wait for 2014 and the Wallstreet Bankers to Dump there Funny Money into Bitcoin and other Cryptocoins we are in for an exciting ride.
