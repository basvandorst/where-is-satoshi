Yeah it’s a too big amount to be a dust attack, I think it’s truly a fellow bitcoiners with a generous heart

I know I hate this slowness but here in Italy it's still the normality unless you live in a big city. 
10 mpbs down, 1 mbps up. And I'm lucky because in my area almost everyone is with 7 down and 0,7 up.
I don't want to limit the upload, I want to give it all to the network but only to honest nodes.

You have to ELI5 because I'm ignorant. Some educational link?
@_date: 2019-03-18 15:45:34
Of nothing, I'm just hungry for knowledge
@_date: 2019-03-18 15:56:01
That's interesting, thank you
@_date: 2019-03-18 15:52:12
Yeah ahaah you caught me I'm here in D.C. and I'm bored, but don't say it around.
Anyway, maybe they're just A LOT of new miners ;)

If it’s like you said, I know the methods to hide my trail, don’t worry. They will fail doing such things to me.  However I will hodl until 1 satoshi is 1 dollar before moving them.

Problem resolved I think, that [127.0.0.1]( it's the way bitcoinj appear when is connected via Tor. Thanks to everyone!

The only idiots are those who get their brains screwed by this propaganda and who concentrate on a molecule as cause of the world's ills, so they cannot see all the rest.
However the climate is an extremely complex system and no one has yet understood it, all the hysteria around the theme stems from predictive models that are as inaccurate and in bad faith as are the people and institutions that programmed them, with a precise political agenda.
Because rulers love us so much and if they'll make drastic decisions that go against us they will do it only because they are good and want the good of the world, saving us from climate apocalypse.

Maybe with a deflationary money we have the right incentives to stop being so fucking consumerist, not buying things that we really don't need.
@_date: 2019-09-04 11:09:27
Do you know that also your breath emits CO2?
And how much does the banking system pollute in the world?
@_date: 2019-09-04 14:39:37
It's not negligible cause all the eco-fascist like who downvoted tend to forget that. CO2 is life, not poison.
Not even I have the answer, but I have the feeling that the numbers would be brutal for the banking sector; payment circuits, armored trucks, banks branches, skyscrapers, millions of employees going to work by car, executives traveling by private jet, etc.

Bitstamp, or therocktrading that is an Italian exchange from 2007, but I'don't know if they have an app
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:36:26
Yes it is, I know how it works but what you say doesn't apply to this because my problem was with the incoming connection not with the upload. If a node is open to others, it would fill the upload not the download.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:49:17
Thanks I hadn't thought of debugging. I looked into it and perhaps discovered what's happened.
I see a long list like this:
ERROR: AcceptBlockHeader: Consensus::ContextualCheckBlockHeader: 000000000000000000639be19a0123a1c99d9fef89f0b8ac055a77f4ef86ae3b, bad-diffbits, incorrect proof of work (code 16) 
for the entire period in which they were connected (before I banned them).
So I think it was some bad guy who wanted to feed me with their bad invalid blocks. 
I don't know why my node didn't automatically banned them, but hey nothing is perfect.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:24:04
No you didn't. I never said I run ABC. The "attackers" run ABC, not me. Is it clear now?
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:22:19
In fact I didn't do it. I never said I'm running ABC, I edited just because people don't read and then comment at random. Before the post was: "I run a **full node** and I've noticed some blablabla..." so I edited to "I run a Bitcoin Core full node blabla"
@_date: 2018-12-10 11:47:47
It can be everything or nothing
@_date: 2018-12-10 11:19:31
Ok I'm not so good as a technician but I'll try
@_date: 2018-12-10 11:15:01
Clear explanation, however the blockchain already exceeds 200 gb ;) 
Yeah it si weird and it intrigues me
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:00:14
Thanks I banned them, anyway others have connected in these days with the same modus operandi so I banned them too.
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:12:58
What does this represent to me?
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:36:14
If you switch to coinbase pro (gdax) you pay just a insignificant percentage like 0,25% for a market order or 0,15 % for a limit order,  and you pay nothing to withdraw.
Minimum orders is 10 euros so I think it's a good choice, it's not simple like buying from the app but it's much cheaper than any other exchange and more satisfying because you act directly on the market.
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:11:32
Yes I know that,  thank you for the advice. Anyway I use the GUI version so it's even more easier to do, just have to click on the peer.
@_date: 2018-12-10 10:33:57
No I don't use it
@_date: 2018-12-10 10:54:42
What you mean with non meaningful 127.0.0.1 Ip? Sorry but I do a bit of effort to understand english well :)
Anyway when I say same bitcoinj Ip I mean that I have 60 connections from this 47.106.143.234 that run bitcoinj.
I will edit the post by adding a screenshot. 
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:38:50
I think it's the first thing you said, but also the second.
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:06:17
I’m using bitcoin core 0.18 (knots). ABC was the node connected to me.
