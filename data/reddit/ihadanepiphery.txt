it's ironic how the rhetoric went from "saving the poor immigrant workers from the evil of westernunion" to "get the fuck out of here you worthless scum" in just a couple of years

i like bitcoin but with such fees it's no longer a privilege 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:26:36
You're in the US and had this much trouble, imagine trying to purchase btc in a third world country where: 
- There are no local exchanges whatsoever.
- Localbitcoins if filled with police informants trying to get people falsely arrested for money laundering and capital flight charges.
- Most foreign exchanges like coinbase and circle don't accept users from non-US residents.
- The ones who do like cex.io require too much verification information + platform fees + foreign currency exchange fees + allowing only credit cards which is unattainable for most people where i live.
- No bitcoin ATMs whatsoever cause it's a legal mess.
- Buy btc from  purse.io with up to 25% markup + shipping fees
My only chance left to get my hands on bitcoin is to buy them from local online forums and facebook groups which are not exactly immune to fraud but what else can i do!

is it too late yet? will we ever regret not buying at $600-700 now cause "it's too dumb to buy this high"? 
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:07:41
it's ok, but why would you send the btc from coinbase to kraken if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2017-01-17 19:59:00
did you try paxful?
@_date: 2016-11-11 04:18:04
Thanks everybody for replying. too bad it sounded like an easy way to make some bucks :(
@_date: 2016-11-01 21:42:51
i am planning to do so when i am wealthy enough to save, right now i am interested in trading and arbitraging as a source of income
@_date: 2016-11-01 21:31:43
That makes sense of course if i want to invest but i am looking into day trading so i have to watch the prices closely!
@_date: 2016-11-01 21:39:04
I am on of those sorry noobs who always buy high and sell low out of panic! never quite knew how the price would change, i have been advised to wait till the price is stable again after a sudden spike which is wise but it seems like it has been increasing gradually recently so i am tempted to buy again in hopes of seeing the price increase more
@_date: 2016-11-25 18:27:27
Aha, seems similar to the restrictions in my country except we don't have any local exchanges! i know some people who buy mining rigs just for the purpose of getting btc/usd regardless if the mining process is profitable or not.. just a way to "convert" local currency to USD or crypto
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:21:09
how do you send cash from coinbase to kraken? 
@_date: 2016-11-01 21:41:17
thanks! i will ask there
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:07:22
If i were in India what stops me from buying from other global exchanges for a lower price and sell it back at the Indian exchange? 
@_date: 2016-11-04 13:45:08
can you explain why? i first thought it must be hard to get your money out of there once you sell but i haven't tried so..
@_date: 2016-11-11 01:23:41
how much in average do you lend per time? 
@_date: 2016-11-25 18:29:08
I bet Indian exchanges are making shit ton of money off of this!
@_date: 2016-11-12 01:37:00
Sounds good! i think dealing with small amounts helps minimizing the loss from chargebacks, right? 
@_date: 2016-11-04 14:24:10
Of course it is! sounded too good to be true because it is. i found [this one]( as well selling for $773.86!! 
Thanks a lot for clarifying this :) 
@_date: 2016-11-01 21:46:56
Yeah that's true, every one expected the price to increase dramatically immediately after the halving and nothing happened even a few months after!
@_date: 2016-11-01 21:40:34
Yeah i've heard that many times but i just never learn!
@_date: 2016-11-25 18:44:09
was going to ask the same..
@_date: 2016-09-16 00:03:06
try cex.io
@_date: 2016-10-20 21:56:20
No bank will give you a cent unless you're traveling abroad 
@_date: 2016-10-20 21:55:24
No bitcoins ATMs here unfortunately and localbitcoins is risky as you mentioned.. [someone already got arrested for using localbitcoins!]( and nobody goes near that site anymore since then except a few people who will exchange for very high premiums which is the equivalent of USD's black market price!
@_date: 2016-10-22 01:43:19
That would work well if there is only one exchange rate but almost everybody run to the black market for much higher rates which leaves no reason for anyone with foreign capital to settle for any low rates. as i mentioned there are already people who sell bitcoin locally but their rates are just ridiculous!  
@_date: 2016-10-20 01:11:12
if you don't mind the 10 to 20% markup 
@_date: 2016-10-29 21:51:13
it's hard to curb the urge to buy when the price keeps moving up, you feel it's gonna be your last chance to buy "cheaper"
@_date: 2016-10-27 11:25:54
try paxful.com
@_date: 2016-10-22 01:44:05
that's why i am looking for an alternative
@_date: 2016-10-22 01:43:43
not sure i get what you mean..
@_date: 2016-10-22 01:38:11
Unfortunately it's quite difficult to leave the country if you aren't wealthy, i apply for diversity lottery every year but that's about it.
Having a relative or a closer friend abroad is almost the ideal solution but it wouldn't be fair to ask them to exchange at the low official rate when they can get a much higher price on the black market, it's almost like having to lose 50% of their savings if they decide to exchange at the official rate! 
 
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:01:34
yeah :(
