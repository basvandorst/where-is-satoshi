They won't survive regardless. They've repeatedly shown over the last few months they don't know how to properly run a secure exchange. I love how a bunch of people are like "If Bitfinex fails it'll hurt the bitcoin market" ignoring the fact that it already failed, it already hurt the market, and the market is recovered already. There are other exchanges, and someone will take Bitfinex's place, just as so many others took Mt. Gox's.

I'm not to blame for any BTC being stolen in the way it was. I'm to blame for trusting Bitfinex to do what they said they would. In no way am I suggesting that Bitfinex owes anyone anything except what they have put in that wasn't stolen (USD/ETH/etc). I'm basicly for allowing people to withdraw other currency and walking away, because no trader who isn't an idiot will continue trading there (save for having fun trying to make money back on their worthless IOU crapcoin).

As someone with 60% of my Bitfinex portfolio in BTC, I say just cut that out and let me withdraw the ETC/ETH/LTC/DOGE/etc. I'd be ok if they said "We lost all the Bitcoin. Sorry, it's gone."

True, but it was a smaller attack and fixed much sooner and they were open and transparent from the get go. Couple this with the Bitfinex outage about a month before the attack and they've left a very bad taste in peoples mouths. Poloniex could bounce back because they could cover their loses, Bitfinex is now all-in and people are still suspicious of them (that they are lying about funds, that it's an inside job, that they actually are investigating with FBI, INTERPOL, or other law enforcement). In a perfect world, they would have an investor who sees the opportunity to double down and bail them out, avoiding the haircut or minimizing it, Bitfinex isn't over leveraged when it begins trading, and people slowly build trust and value in the BFX Omni

I think you are misunderstanding my tone greatly, and I don't care for yours. I'm not complaining that this is risky. I'm complaining that Bitfinex is kowtowing to others who are complaining because they lost money. I'm lucky in that I didn't lose any BTC at Bitfinex. If I had, I would still be of the opinion that Bitfinex needs to die and let another exchange take it's place.

Insolvent doesn't matter when Bitfinex will still be bankrupt by the end of the year. They're squabbling about how they should arrange the silverwear when they can't see the massive iceberg they just hit. How do you run a business that nobody will ever trust again, that is massively in debt due to a robbery caused by their own negligence, and that has shut down all profit generation for over a week now with no timeline to start it back up.

"Oh don't worry about beefing up security. If they hack us the investors will bail us out"
The sooner people put Bitfinex in the same headspace as Mt. Gox the better.

I for one don't care if the Bitfinex stock coin or whatever makes a profit. I'm taking my money and leaving the second I can. Anyone who doesn't suspect that the majority of accounts will do that is fooling themselves. Bitfinex died on the day of the hack. They are delusional if they think they can resurrect it. There is always another company without massive failures waiting to take over

I've taken the stance that I lost everything. If and when withdrawals come back, I'm taking it all out as fast as possible. If USD or anything else is put on hold, I just consider it lost. Better than trusting a company who's shown they have no idea how to keep something secure.

A. It sucks, but Bitfinex is ultimately to blame for not doing what they could to secure things.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:48:02
It's an exchange. It's expressly for the purpose of buying other altcoins/fiat and diversifying your portfolio. Ideally you regularly keep other funds out so you don't lose everything.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:52:14
Step 1: Fire everyone who isn't part of helping users' withdraw their remaining funds. Step 2: Allow users to withdraw remaining funds. If you are unlucky enough to be hit by Bitfinex's incompetence and lost money, sorry but that's the game.
Bitfinex, you're already dead, stop dragging this out.

That's why I think this IOU coin is hilarious. It's not worth the bandwidth it takes up. It never will be. Imagine if Bear Sterns tried to give investors an IOU for their bonds.

Good luck doing any actual trading on Bitsquare. They have no volume and the entire UI/UX is awful. Almost every other site that isn't decentralized does it better. There is a reason it still hasn't caught on. I've tried using it, but it's just too unreliable when you actually want to trade currencies.

I like Trezor, but I hate companies that do the "THE POPULAR OPTION IS NOT SECURE! YOU SHOULD USE THIS METHOD......what's this? Oh yeah, we are the only company offering it. Guess you should buy our product"
That said I agree with the others who mention SQRL. Hope to see it get implemented (it's not officially released though even though Steve claimed it was done over a year ago)

Ah, I didn't know this was the same protocol Yubikey used. My mistake! Any plans to make a smaller form factor Trezor? That would be perfect to carry around.

Well considering he wants to trade 300000 BTC for BCC...I'd want to know he can pay before taking him up on that offer. Not to say it needs to be public, but still...
