This is all I can find.  Is this what you're talking about?

Honestly that's what I was doing until I realized that every week a new wallet is hacked and bitcoins are stolen.
Bitcoin is simply not safe no matter how you look at it.  Given time, all wallets will be hacked--probably less than a year and no one is doing ANYTHING to fix it or explain it.
Hell there's no need to worry about new features because the bitcoin space can't even get security right.

Not at all.  It just means, as always, NEVER give anyone your private key.

I seriously doubt the devs give two shits about twitter.  They likely subbed it out to someone incompetent.

Who gives a shit?  I'll send from the same address over and over as well.  NEVER had a problem.  As long as someone doesn't have my private key, I'm fine.  
If this does become a problem then bitcoin is fucking useless and everyone may as well abandon the whole idea.

Thank you.  Are there any digital currencies currently using this?

I use Bing every night before I go to bed to relax me.

I'll use the same damn address over and over.  This makes no sense.  As long as someone doesn't have my private key, I'm fine.  In fact, this whole change address bullshit is what causes a ton of people to LOSE their bitcoins.  They forget to backup these dumb ass wallets that keep putting their bitcoins all over the place.

The md5sum or sha hash.  Once the developers sign off on it and give you the valid hash, you just check that what you downloaded has the same hash.  You could download it from anywhere.
