But I don't really need to talk to the card issuers... Once I take their money it is mine. If I can automatize recieving it on an optimal ewallet service then instantly sending it to btc via there a.k.a purchasing btc

That's really:
1) Crazy
2) Unfortunate
3) Crazy!!!!
This banks must be fighting like crazy to prevent BTC from taking over!
I have to come up with a system of convenience for buyers!
Problem is I'm not gonna expect buyers to do anything I wouldn't!

Let me explain.
I want to have an e commerce store.
Customer comes, regular prices in fiat.
He purchases and checks out in fiat and recieves invoice.
No mention of btc.
Money is then tranfered to bitcoin on the back end, anonymized with an app like coinbase end sent to storage.
It's a really simple system, I'm sure it's not the hardest thing to build.
This is so I can keep all the potential earnings (heard bad stories of people making $200k and being frozen by paypal with impossible requirements) in Bitcoin, so that if it reaches over a million USD I can pay taxes only when introducing the cash to fiat. Like rich people do with stocks. BTC is essentially like a stock.

I appreciate your response, it's very well thought out and lot's off great links.
However, my main concern is Buyer convenience!
I know I myself would get very turned down if I had to follow a whole tutorial just to purchase something.
That alone invalidates the attempt to lecture people to pay in bitcoin.
I would have to offer them a very substantial benefit if I were to go that route, however knowing how lazy people are, and how easy it is for them to buy things when it's 1-click for 10$ of their eWallet, it's like paying with air, so they do it cause it's convenient.
If this becomes a process where they have to think, they will immediately get turned off so that's why this is key.
