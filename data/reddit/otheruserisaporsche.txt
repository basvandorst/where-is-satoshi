That's how I've seen other subscriptions deal with this: same pricing, longer time period.
If anything Bitcoin payments should be discounted.
At this pricing, this is only beneficial for promotional purposes, or people that are willing to pay for anonymity.

Give them $500k then.

No, not alone at all. 
General sentiment has been headed that way for a while:

Everyone commenting on that picture:

True. 
Though I think we can agree that it's the culture of ridiculing someone who is new to Bitcoin that should be discouraged.

Nice. This is a great way to lower the barriers to entry.

Some other things:
1) When I open it in another chrome profile, no problem, I see the green "QKOS services Limited[GB]" icon beside the address.
2) Even in the same chrome profiel, when I open it in another tab i get the green security icon.
3) When I hit reload in that window, it stays red. 
4) In the insecure window, there is a double diamond on the right hand side of the url field, indicating that the page wants to set gmail as the handler for mailto: links. That doesn't appear in other windows.

Thank you. 
I get this, it's not my first time around the block, and I've heard about all the thefts lately. But at the same time, somehow my windows 7 machine doesn't feel much safer.
I'm waiting for a piper wallet (r-pi, stand alone paper wallet printer) to come in, all other options are too intensive (Live CD ubuntu), etc. I don't even trust printing a paper wallet printed off my windows machine.  
Bitcoin is so paranoia inducing.

If Coinbase did this, maybe it would work.  But you need to have a Coinkite account to use it their POS system.  
And, I wouldn't expect a mass migration of people over to a Coinkite wallet any time soon.  Their pricing scheme is pretty incomprehensible: either 2.47% per withdrawal(!?) or a monthly fee that they appear to manually adjust as the exchange increases. Was 0.06, then 0.03, now 0.01.  What'll it be next week?
When I can get a free online wallet with 10 other companies, why these guys? Security?  I'm not going to pay to test their claims. 
As for the debit card thing. When building a two sided market, you usually need to get lots of one side in cheaply, then charge the other side.  
I want to spend my bitcoin in local stores, but there's no reason that it should be through a proprietary system that tells me where I have to bank to do it.

Hey guy, question, is there only one public key per private key?
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:33:59
That sucks to hear. I guess that saying "Everyone" was obviously hyperbolic, but that what get's clicks these days.
Either I'm delusional, or ahead of my time, or just a terrible communicator. 
Does it not seem to you that Bitcoin has created many new millionaires from thin air this year?  Is it not possible  that it could go up 100x again this year, and then 100x the next year? Maybe not probable, but possible. 
Does that not seem disruptive?

"Adoptation" really should be a word.
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:47:20
Why say "will suffice", when "works" suffices?
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:46:22
Except it's worse because difficulty is meant to go up every 2016 blocks, which is 14 days at 10 minutes per block. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:05:25
oh. That makes so much more sense.

That's quite amazing!  You might just relocate the Blockchain.info server to a little blip off map that says location unknown.
Have you considered trying to analyze this data overtime to illustrate the spread? 
It would be amazing to see an animation across the history of the block chain, with a heatmap corresponding to transactions per day.  (does that make sense).
Anyhow, it's awesome, and I don't doubt you have your own awesome ideas.
