His prediction should have been that Darkcoin will reach 10 dollars a coin instead of Bitcoin
Just messing with him he made a calculation based on idiocy and needs to own up to it

I completely agree with you! The main thing why most of people  don't support btc now is because they feel insecure, and feel that this system is incomplete now, and they are right, it just needs time to develope and complete.

I'll print it as a poster on the wall :)

Not to give interview at all is not a solution, lot's of people read WSJ and they have to know what is happening. we just need to make up the way to control journalists to avoid misinterpretation

experts with at least 10 years experience in Bitcoin, are they kidding?

3 words
Decentralized public ledger.
the supplier is trying to centralise the ledger.. even if he puts them on different ports and IP addresses, its all still in one single physical location with one single physical controller.

Is it possible for a secure hardware wallet or a bitcoin signing tag to provide the "green address" signature?  The idea would be that the secure hardware contains a signing key that the user does not know and uses this to sign authorized transactions.  The secure hardware would track which outputs it has signed in the past to prevent the possibility of double spending.

BTC will never be a micro-transaction platform? sorry

"I just don't see Bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar." it's obvious!
@_date: 2014-03-16 08:38:36
it's normal to have hesitations about it because btc is still a new phenomena to many people, so we all need more time to get used to it 
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:18:52
by the way it's a nice portrait!

Now let's say the manufacturer of the secure hardware learns that one of its signing keys loaded into a device (or devices) in the field is compromised.  The manufacturer can't stop his in-field hardware from producing signatures with the now-compromised green-address key.  Would it be possible for the manufacturer to revoke certification for just this particular key (or keychain)?  If so, can you explain in more detail how this would be done?

gosh it's so difficult to make out which colour is for which section, but survey is really useful.

one entity (the supplier) hosting all of these and in full control, is defeating the purpose of why nodes are suppose to exist.

First of all let me say I'm a noob.
I still use bitcoin-qt latest version.
Do I have to upgrade it to bitcoin core? And, above all, Is it an upgrading or they are two different things?

I seriously dont want PayPal to be a big player in BTC business. Those bulky sharks come with a lots of regulation. Let them die with FIAT.

I think he should charge 0. If he really considers bitcoin to be undervalued, and his report has merit, the correct play would be for him to buy bitcoin, then widely and freely release the report.

Looks like it's so tireds of slow mining

I applaud these guys on there mission as it will only be more beneficial for the community going forward. Hopefully, more Indonesians realize the benefits and free them from the highly inflationary currency. We're starting to take the world by storm.

True, my thought it was going to develop into a large change in the financial world
