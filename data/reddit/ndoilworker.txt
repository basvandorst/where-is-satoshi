Then you should understand deterrents...


...and how they're implemented.


...And how they work


If only they could measure how many plots were thwarted by the fear of having an operative caught and interrogated.

I mean, does anyone enjoy seeing a 20% drop of their investments in a day? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:24:59
Jesus how many do you have

Cry us a river. If even one bomb was stopped by the use of scanners then it was worth you taking your shoes off. And this is from someone who has been on over 30 flights this year. It's really not a big deal, it doesn't actually make your life harder, it's a 5 minute process(not including line) before you get on a big metal bird and fly through the air.

Yea at 13 something. It wasn't just bitcoin, it was the fact that everything I had was down 20%

$9,400 seems a bit excessive. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:35:19
Must be, I can't imagine an old van, scrap steel, and your own labor could total up to 9,400, especially in China. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:39:17
Same.

30 min. Gave me a different price. I bought at 10,050 received at 10,200
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:55:05
Well I didn't know it was down. I downloaded the app and went through the process and purchased some bitcoin via my debit card. Now it shows my limit sans the amount I purchased, but nothing  in my transactions and no debit on my account...im guessing this happens often, do you still come in at the same price when the site comes back up?
Edit: Nevermind, went through. Looks like it's up, my bank just freaked out over the charges.
