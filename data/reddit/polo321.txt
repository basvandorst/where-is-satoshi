Lol are you retarded? why do you think they’ve reduced? Magic? Or the fact that less people are buying btc? What do you think will happen to fees when btc starts going back up??
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:57:31
I bought my first bitcoin before the China dip. I just sold so be prepared to go to the moon. Once I buy again they’ll be another drop
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:56:26
And when the dip comes, you have people running around like headless chickens here.

He should’ve spent more Fiat on a better hair transplant surgeon.

My guess is they already have a bunch of addresses which are given out upon sign up. I wouldn’t recommend having a primary wallet on those sites as they can close at any given moment.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:05:45
Nobody said anything about bubble you fool, bitcoin always comes down after a rally.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:54:33
This is going to sound crazy but try getting high (on weed) sometimes I remember random things I did years ago when I try to remember them

Price goes up-people interested. Price goes down-eh it’s probably a scam- me when bitcoin was £170

Seems like Reddit’s neckbeards have ended up on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:48:16
Did he do it with a currency or stocks?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:14:47
I'm just pissed I bought my first bitcoin at 4400

Come on brah. I invested my first bitcoin just before the dip and I'm not that upset...well I am, but live on instant noodles for a bit if you're getting anxious.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:55:47
Brb selling anus to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:03:33
Good I hope they go, every year they start this bs.
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:57:48
Isn’t it supposed to drop in value a little before nov 18th?
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:06:07
Shhhh...I need the price to drop so I can buy more
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:46:10
To be fair the person who bought the pizza could’ve easily bought the same amount of coins.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:42:55
Who the hell wants to live in Grimsby?

@_date: 2017-10-21 19:15:04
Like everyone here I’ll be buying in at that time
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:18:21
If the amazon rumours turn out to be false then it will drop.
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:12:37
oh damn ok 158k is very different.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:35:21
Trade route :( couldn’t buy any weed yesterday. Plus the main link for dream stopped working.
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:15:07
I bought weed for 0.68 bitcoin 3 years ago. The worst part is I only remembered now because for some weird reason I had a dream about it yesterday.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:39:14
What time would you say would be the best to buy? I bought just before the China crash and was really thinking about selling to buy more btc at a lower price. Unfortunately I listened to the people on this sub and Hodl’d, nothing wrong with it, but I should’ve gone with what I wanted to do in the first place.

@_date: 2017-10-12 10:41:51
Wait a few hours and let this peak drop.
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:50:27
Yeah the reference is the messege, it looks like your username but little different.
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:22:50
It’s the bank address in Estonia. Make sure the reference is in the message otherwise the deposit will take over a week to clear, the gimp at santander didn’t do it after I asked 3 times
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:49:52
You missed he bit where bitcoin is a currency and needs to be spent to give it value, bitcoin is not a stock.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:26:23
Kinda hoping there is some fud so I can buy cheap coins lol

It could be worse.....I made my first 0.5 bitcoin purchase couple of hours before the dip at 3.5k gbp.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:04:02
Oh no we’re not looks like it’s a sale.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:26:58
10.30 gmt as far as I know
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:13:32
Newbies don’t listen to him, sell so I can buy cheaper.
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:02:02
I just use a separate bitcoin account for purchases.
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:47:07
I thought it would’ve been a lot more than 158
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:16:50
This, or maybe even their own hardfork.

So you can’t use a currency that people are using?
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:44:57
Name one person that bought bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin core. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:03:36
Lmao. Do you actually think full blocks are a good thing? I’ll give you a clue, maybe you could rub the last two brain cells you have and come up to a conclusion. What happened in December to bcore when the blocks were full?
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:54:42
Wow lmao you have this whole lightning thing because of 1mb blocks. Wow this sub really amazes me with the stupidity and lack of knowledge. I don’t t what I’m talking about lmao. Btw why is the fees for bitcoin cash close to zero with 8mb blocks? And don’t tell me tx bitcoin cores fees were close to 60 at 19k
@_date: 2017-05-18 09:04:23
I Transferred btc Tuesday 5.30 pm and I had 13 confirmations by 3pm the next day after 14 hours of no confirmations. It was 190 s/b fee.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:39:23
Lol carry on mate, once 32mb fork happens, fees are practically free, along with faster transaction times than bcore. Why would anyone use a currency where you have learn to use a complicated system that isn’t even recommended by the creators??
