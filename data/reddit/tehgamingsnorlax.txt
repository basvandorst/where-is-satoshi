Sorry I don't think I was clear, I was pointing out that for bitcoin to form a new block you needs valid hash. The consensus rule decides which hashes are valid of course but the reached consensus being legitimate and not the result of an attack relies on the fact that the majority of hash power is legitimate. For example if 51% of the hashing power in the network decided to create a fork that reversed the last few hours of transactions theoretically they could outpace and replace the main chain. This wouldn't matter whether that power came from a dozen or a thousand different computers

It isn't the number of nodes it's the power of nodes pushing that consensus, the consensus must be valid which the bitcoin algorithm validates and can be validated by anyone. A node running the correct algorithm if shown a longer chain should drop their chain for that one so more power pushing a chain the faster it grows so for a government to corner the market they need 51% of all the power in the network to create a consensus that is preferable to the other nodes than the legitimate one.

Hashpower is what decides consensus though, this is typically referred to as proof of work. If you had a Blockchain that had nodes vote on the correct Block to add to the blockchain then sure you could that but that's why proof of work is used. Something you could look up is different types of proof like proof of stake where you need to show you'll lose out if the chain gets forked or something like that
