Why are you even wasting you time on a bitcoin sub reddit asking pointless questions that won't ever get a reasonable response?
People believe in what they want to.

I feel that mate :/

It's a pretty shit and old documentary. If you don't anything about bitcoin then sure it's alright

You sad fuck. Correcting other people's grammar online. Kys

I feel like a lot of people get hung up on all the politics revolving around bitcoin which leads to nowhere. Lead with your actions not your words.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:09:59
I disagree, I think that bitcoin in nature would always be a community project, unfortunately some people have tried to tangle bitcoin up with politics but at heart bitcoin doesn't have to involve as much politics as people do. 
I dearly hope that bitcoin becomes what the majority of the community want it to. For now I don't think I want a part in it.

You shouldn't leave coins on coinbase. Keep them in a wallet (software one or hardware one) the hardware wallets, from what the 10 sec research I did, only seem to manage the wallet for you. By manage I mean store your data like your private, public keys and bitcoin address. Its not that difficult to wrap your head around, I would advise to just do it yourself so you understand how it works that way in the future you wont have the problem of trying to use obsolete hardware that fuck all people know how to use anymore.

thank you, I love learning about cryptography but understand almost nothing about it .
@_date: 2017-02-27 13:54:10
This is good advice for anyone! Always doing more research (objective) will help you see a clearer picture of what the possiblities are.

I think its naive to believe that there is a peaceful (non-violent) way to over come what the western world has become, at the same time I don't think anything is going to happen soon because too many people are engrossed in their lives to really look at whats going on in the world and not listen to whatever bs media outlets spew. (yes i knoww there are crediable sources out there but the majority of people do not care enough to find them)
Bitcoin at least is a way to detach my currencies from goverments and countries. I wish I could live a life where my currency was always in bitcoin but sadly It's not very easy to achieve and its not very practical.

That's you need to research it objectively, there are stronger arguments and evidence, including laws of physics, that argue that jumping off a tall building will result in death or injury.

It's not perfect if the price fluctuates. I appreciate it for what it is but storing any amount of wealth in bitcoin is a risky endeavour.
In a wildly hypothetical situation one day you could buy 1 BTC at $8000 the next day it's worth $6000. You've just lost 2k. You could also potentially make more but there in lies the problem. The comparative worth of bitcoin fluctuates too wildly

Your comment makes no sense. Net neutrality, blocking people's accounts, shutting down and seizing assets of crypto currency exchanges l - all of this effects more then your "bitcoin neckbeards". At that point the government would be stepping over so many people that something is bound to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:45:34
That's how you create a revolution.

I don't think the people of r/BTC are gullible enough to click on your link mate, let alone actually read your comment as if you weren't being a shill

Less editing please. The speech/talk had enough merit on its own , I'm not a child that needs to be entertained with bright colours and noises.

Having polish family I was proud to find out that they where investing in crypto's. A lot of polish people aren't as quiet or slow as we may seem. We keep to ourselves but I can vouch for this, no one here trusts the banks.
Our country has been fucked around enough, people aren't as blind as others here.

Unrelated to bitcoin. Post your marriage counseling somewhere else.

Well yeah you moron. Money is the defining factor of weather you die or don't. Learn some skills, humans have lived without money in the past. It's not that difficult to fish, or grow food. My point still stands. If you have a negative attitude and give up because something changed then you're too lazy to adapt and survive 
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:27:55
Don't underestimate how naive people can be. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:45:44


The only constant is change. You adapt or die. Everything instant in your life is life changing, how drastically it affects depends on how well you can adapt.

It's not racist. People fling that word at every single action these days. The majority of our world respects a person's freedom and your free to have your own opinion on who you trust and distrust, your free to express your opinion. However your not free to force your opinion onto others or insult or even be violent to people with other opinions :)
