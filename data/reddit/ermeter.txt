Isn't bitcoin price propped up by fake tethers?
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:51:53
Don't worry a wild ride is coming soon. A real roller coaster.

Mtgox started stealing from silk road related accounts when they had money issues, could this be similar.

Bitcoin has been in early stage for a decade now.
@_date: 2019-11-01 07:50:44
Expect bitcoin to drop to below $100 when this scam finally ends.
@_date: 2018-10-12 11:05:15
Bitfinex has stopped all fiat deposit and withdrawal.
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:21:19
1 tether is 0 USD as Tether does not have to legally redeem tethers.

Scammers and hackers can operate freely in Russia as long as they pay authorities a cut.
@_date: 2018-10-08 17:06:38
Crypto capital, Tether, Bitfinex are all the same people.
@_date: 2018-10-15 18:37:24
All the risk is for their customers. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:52:55
Bitfinex stopped USD deposits/withdrawals. People are buying bitcoin, driving price up, to flee the maybe sinking ship. 
Also tether is crashing a bit, that apparently somehow also makes bitcoin price go up.
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:09:35
Apparently they stopped using their Noble bank.
Now got booted from second bank.
They've stopped taking deposits.
People are complaining that withdrawals are not working.
Tether is selling for below $1.
@_date: 2018-06-23 10:15:09
You mean in 5 years bitcoin will again be pumped by an exchange?
@_date: 2018-06-12 06:24:34
There was no good reason for bitcoin to go to 20000 either, bit noone is complaining about that.
@_date: 2018-06-12 06:29:05
If Tether turns out to be unbacked 1000 can be in a few months.
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:03:29
Some law firm did an audit. There's 20 lines of legal text in the audit on how the audit is actually not an audit.
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:55:37
I agree that people don't initially pay for tether. 
After half a year it was a mere 1.3 billion dollars in tethers. I agree that making 3 billion dollars in half a year is a bit far fetched. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:55:35
It will drop the same way later. Almost artificial.
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:05:02
Tether price sometimes drops to as low as 85 cents. Is instant 15% profit if you buy.
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:37:13
You also have to believe that someone paid 250 million for no interest non refundable tethers(fine print of tethers state they don't have to be redeemed). Same for the other 2.5 billion tethers out there.
You also have to believe Bitfinex/tether went from being bankrupt enough to take 36% of their customers money to having 3 billion backed tether in half a year.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:43:48
I expect to see people camping outside bitfinex headquarters in a few months.
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:24:21
Bitcoin price always goes up after tether print.
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:37:18
Market cap is a useless measure. The second people start cashing out bitcoin in large numbers, market cap will collapse.
@_date: 2019-04-29 07:49:59
It was made by the nsa, there probably is some backdoor somewhere. You are basically drawing a big target on your back that you are doing something illegal when you use it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:11:39
Tether does not have to redeem tethers. Is it in their rational self interest to keep 3 billion dollars or give it to other people?
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:25:27
People are worried about tether. Also next year mtgox refund will be coming.
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:55:16
Bitcoin will give you access to the pleasure dome once Satoshi returns to take the true hodl faithful on his interstellar cometh.
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:29:31
I hear big institutional investors are getting into dollar. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:25:27
People are willing to take a 3-15% loss on their tethers to get rid of them. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:33:07
What did you learn from this?
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:38:03
Next year 100.000 mtgox bitcoins will hit market.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:52:19
1btc = 127 usdt.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:11:37
That is because of growing population. That won't give you astronomical growth though.
I expect Bitcoin to fade to a niche in time.

Best is that Mark will end up a billionaire at the end.

Big capital just won't allow us to profit of our works.

*P1 buys 1 Btc for $100. Bitcoin value is now $100. P1 has $-100.
*P1 sells to P2 for $200. Bitcoin value is now $200. P1 has $100. P2 has $-200.
*P2 sells to P3 for $300. Bitcoin value is now $300. p2 hass $100. P3 has $-300.
*P3 tries to cash out his btc for fiat. However noone wants to buy bitcoin anymore, as there are better coins now. P1 and P2 made a 100 profit, whoever sold to P1 also got 100 for total of 300. P3 has -300. Combined is zero.
@_date: 2019-09-27 11:38:04
What is backing bitcoin? Do you really think miners will give up their profit once the last bitcoin is mined or do you think they will change the protocol?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:35:48
Also remember it is a zero sum game. For you to make profit someone else has to make a loss and vice versa.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:39:40
The eventual crash will be epic. Remember you can declare bankruptcy, don't suicide.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:46:06
People keep falling for these scams. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:06:55
Ask in legaladvice. You might be allowed to keep money. Bank once accidently send me money. Bank could not return it without my permission.
@_date: 2018-07-12 06:14:22
Bitfinex/Tether manipulated the market up to 20000. There was no good reason for that rise. Tether is going to turn out to be unbacked, sending bitcoin to $200.
@_date: 2018-07-01 17:25:35
Tether can dissolve itself tomorrow and not have to redeem any tether. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:16:57
Buy high and hodl.

How does it feel to become a rich rich man?
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:42:07
This might be people fleeing fleeing from tether into bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:41:20
In my opinion bitcoin was pumped to 20000 by tether. That scam is slowly coming apart. Expect bitcoin to return to pre pump levels at below 1000.
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:37:03
The mtgox bitcoins still have to be dropped on the market.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:17:42
You should buy now that way bitcoin needs to rise less for you to make a profit.
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:26:53
They will be returned to the claimants next year. What they do with their bitcoins is their choice. If half of them decide to cash out that is 50000 bitcoins hitting the market at same time.
