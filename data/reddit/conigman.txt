Ok thanks for all the answers.
Can the miners collude and verify fake transactions?

The dollar does fluctuate, but this mainly effects when you buy things abroad.
I am talking domestically. It is almost like me going into a car dealership and paying for a car with my shares. I simply transfer the shares to the car dealership.
Imagine after you pay by Bitcoins, the price of bitcoin falls by 25%....that means the car dealer just sold you a car 25% cheaper than the market value.
I just dont see the practical use of it.

Oh ok, so they are just confirming, validating transactions?

The dollar fluctuating is only a problem for people buying things abroad or exchanging when they go overseas.
You dont worry about the dollar fluctuating in your every day domestic consumption of goods and services.
If you had Bitcoins you would.
How is this even remotely practical?

So the more bitcoins that get distributed the more stable that would be? Sure, but what would that do to the bitcoin price? It would devalue it, no? Also, isnt there a limit of 21 million bitcoins to be issued?
If so then what is the whole pint of bitcoins? I understand block chain technology, but this is also being applied to the banking payments system.
What benefit of crypto currency is there over normal cash in this case?
