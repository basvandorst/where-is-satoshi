the bubble will be end and the revolution will start.

Think about you want to decide something for a group of people, like building roads somewhere, but everyone has his own idea. The decision may never be made because of disagreement. And it would be not efficient.

Guys! You have to admit that whatever you think about Bitcoin cash, it is there forever and will not be destroyed no matter how much you want to it to. Cry more and also feel not comfortable when you see bch rise faster than bitcoin, right? It's not late, join us now. switch your BCE(bitcoin core) to BCH( the real bitcoin ) . Accepting fact is always better than complaining about it

now is always the best time for buying, especially when you see a dip like this , and don't be regret if it goes lower because you know you would be upset more if it goes up again from here
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:17:02
yes, just do whatever makes you feel comfortable. Make sure you understand some fundamental information and knowledge about bitcoin. It's more important than knowing "it's rising and I am making money". It will help you not be panic not only when it is rising, but also when it is falling. " Good trip for us, my friend

Of course i won't sell it. I won't sell it even if it goes 7000% gains. It's a lesson. You learned a lesson, and that's yours, you would't return the lesson back. I will keep these bitcoins forever!

Just sad if you think like this for buying bitcoin. Bitcoin is not designed for making people achieve financial freedom! It is designed for using by everyone. If everyone is financial freedom, then we would all die out. Wake up !

The future thing will only exist in the future. And no one knows what will happen in the future. If everyone is expecting that future would come true right now, the bubble starts. And when everyone figures out that future is not here yet, the bubble bursts.

Thanks for your suggestion, my friend. Here is my view. I loved bitcoin. I don't even care I would get rich or not. I only care one thing, one day I could pay an apple with 0.0004 bitcoin because that apple's price is 0.0004 bitcoin, but not 3usd! That's the reason I bought it.

Yes, I am from the kongfu country, lol . Sorry about my English. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:34:56
Bitcoin: Nope, I am overvalued, sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:48:19
someone knows something bad may happen tomorrow! sell now !
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:00:12
Good example. Yes, it is like a car which be found 500 hundred years ago. Even you tell people that this "Car" thing could run faster 100 times than a horse  if you have oil or gas!  People don't even know what is oil and gas at this time! Using bitpay is like using a horse to drag the car and say: Look, the car is moving!. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:07:29
I won't sell but just for reminding you, you should not give that confidence unless you come from the future. Using the experience to decide for the future is not always right! People believed that earth was the central of the universe for hundreds of years before Copernicus's proof.
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:18:37
Yes , it's necessary process. People get know about this thing during the rise. And the potential of use in the future gains from here. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:48:31
Ok, even that is going to happen some time, it is not the reason you could just imagine about it and do nothing NOW!!! I don't see that in near future like in tomorrow or next month/year, and another question, do we need a currency at the time when everyone is financial freedom? I guess not because resource is plenty for human beings at that moment. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:08:14
If you really think like this way, I can't help. My final word: I am sorry about this and good luck for you. That's all i can do. The pain just started and may never have an end. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:00:39
Ponzi scheme respond. lol
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:51:09
Look at the comments of that video, lol. Most people hate bitcoin, lol 
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:47:42
whenever you have this kind of thought, it's not a good time to buy. when you have an idea like: Oh my god, it's totally dead , it is never going to recover, it's a good time to buy.
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:01:46
so you mean bitcoin is already dead, right? will not be used forever. After the fancy storm pass, it will just become some useless codes. right?
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:09:46
I asked the same question, of course they answered:"Because bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin!"  LOL
