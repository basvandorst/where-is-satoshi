@_date: 2017-12-03 05:58:13
I'm excited because the second volume of the Internet of money just got released.  These books are about why bitcoin is so significant.  If you want to learn how bitcoin works, I recommend getting your hands on the book "Mastering Bitcoin" , which is also written by Andreas.
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:02:25
You don't get it.  I'm looking for proof of where Amaury calls BCH 'Bcash'.
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:12:03
Ah,  I see.  Didn't notice the username of the poster.
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:03:52
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:57:03
I mean where he calls it 'Bcash'.  Even a screenshot will do.

You should have just played along with it and pretended to be outraged.

@_date: 2017-03-29 19:05:24
That's right.  Segwit transactions create outputs are spendable on the BU chain (making it possible to have your coins on both chains at the same time), plus you have to consider the coins yet to be mined after the fork will be mined twice.  
After everything's forked, there is definitely be more coins. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 21:09:57
Who knows?  We might also see a litecoin Unlimited. :)
@_date: 2017-01-13 21:49:11
Yeah, I sure wonder where u/theymos is right now.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:23:13
Yeah, I hate the politics of both sides and hope we can all understand and respect each other more without any hard feelings.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:00:15
Yeah, but if the Lightning network is a trustless system, then it wouldn't happen with the current implementation, and no one would want to upgrade their hub to software that creates coins out of thin air.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:44:58
Interesting, but is that technically possible with current development? Or would it require some huge controversial software upgrade to the network?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:00:08

@_date: 2017-08-14 16:22:10
Correct me if I'm wrong, but from my understanding, all it would take is for one of these KYC hubs to be connected to one that is not.

1.  Move your hashing power over to slush pool (The give you the option not to signal for Segwit 2X).
2.  Upgrade to Bitcoin Core v15 as soon as it comes out, and run a full node.
3.  visit coin.dance/poli 
to see which companies do not support segwit 2X.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:15:11
PM me so we can talk.
Honestly though, I think both both sides have gotten too political and that we should more respect to bitcoiners with opposite views.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:26:06
Not necessarily Core, but it will happen upon true user consensus, not the Silbert agreement.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:35:36
UASFed for it!!
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:21:06
What do they disagree on exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:45:25
If Bitcoin is "only a store of value", then it is just going to be one big bubble.
It must be Peer-to-Peer Electronic cash like the original whitepaper says.  (It must have everyday use cases)
@_date: 2016-11-19 08:22:19
Yes you can take your bitcoins to heaven. (I've thought of this before too)
 Just use a brainwallet or memorize a private key.  
The question is how would you communicate transactions with the Internet still on earth?
@_date: 2016-11-01 01:17:57
I like it!
It would be great if you drew up a cleaner map of this on the computer. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:42:18
But SW is related to the blocksize limit because it caps the blocks at a new limit.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:25:43


I like that.  So worst case scenario, we'll have to use a bunch of TOR connected hubs.
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:24:30
Too bad.  It looks like you would agree with them more.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:05:03
Let me get this strait, a 4mb SW block (witness data and all) = same amount of transactions in 4mb non SW block?
@_date: 2016-12-09 06:48:59
Yep.  Just have to wait patient for the scaling issues to iron themselves out. :)
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:53:05
Should have bought a less expensive car &amp; more bitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:55:49
Good argument against Bitcoin Unlimited.
Is the lightning network compatible with BU?
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:20:05
It's taken by threat of violence.  That's why.
Shouldn't have done that.  Only sell a little bit on localbitcoins at a time or use to to buy stuff.
If you are on coinbase, they automatically generate a report for you.   
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:50:45
probably, but the bigger the pool, the more chance of finding a block
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:00:11
Very funny!!
@_date: 2016-11-24 05:47:55
So what if coinbase has low fees.
If bitcoin is one day worth millions, then the government will be after you.

Thanks for encouraging bitcoin users here to take back their privacy. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:50:38
So is that why bitcoin changed its code at one point from having an adjustable blocksize to having a fixed limit?
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:04:12
Very funny!!
You should post it in as well.
@_date: 2016-11-06 22:51:58
Can't you already run smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain using Counterparty?
@_date: 2016-12-11 03:02:25
At most, I think it would probably just consolidate a little before the next spike.
@_date: 2016-11-05 00:02:18
I'm talking about full nodes, not miners.
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:42:58
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:53:42
The question should be was it ever unsafe? 
And if so, is there a better alternative to making paper wallets?
@_date: 2016-11-24 05:37:58
Is Bitsquare fully functional right now?

Andreas has two more books coming out in a few months.

That would be an ad-homonym.  It is no argument against my coin or my "scaling world" view.  Still, that does not change the fact that I don't approve of such behavior.

Ok, that makes a lot more sense.  I was wrong on that one.  
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:33:52
you should use their handles to get their attention
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:39:51
The main focus for now is wallet integration, which means that your LN node is running in the background along side your wallet and can handle going on and offline smothly.
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:46:03
Question:  When funds are moved to cold storage, do you have to use an on-chain transaction, or is it possible to close the channels off-chain?
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:52:51
As long as you have control over your private keys
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:06:59
Then how are we going to stop the 2x HF network attack in November without a hardfork?
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:17:33


the POW one, right?
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:03:36
~~1.  Why the lightning network won't be centralized:
Simple: the sender of the funds has to have the amount in their payment channel that they wish to send. Node connectivity is the only requirement, and if you think about it, your LN node can help relay transactions without any funds as long as it is connected to other nodes.  (correct me if I'm wrong on this)
Example: 
(10&gt;0&gt;0) (9&gt;1&gt;0) (9&gt;0&gt;1)~~
I like to visualize the system as a Newton's cradle.
2.  Auto-pilot channel switching.  Wow this is quite a game-changer!  You don't have to be "always online" for it to work.  Now I'm curious of how a hardware wallet implementation would work on this, or if it's even possible.
3.  KYC/AML concerns:
The fact that LN uses onion routing, means that most of the communications between the nodes are already encrypted.  That just means that your ISP could only see that you run an LN node, but not know what it is doing.
But like he said, maybe future releases will have built-in support for TOR, I2P, or some type of obfuscation method that will make your node invisible by default.
**Edit:** *My first point was incorrect, as u/cm9kZW8K has pointed out.  When you send a LN transaction, your node/wallet has to find a path of channels with enough funds.*
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:59:07
I think it could save us from segwit 2x.  I hope more discussions about it happen.
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:30:56
good question.
Does anyone know if it's possible to close payment channels off-chain?  How would this work?
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:07:42
Do some research and pick the side that you think best contributes to bitcoin's usefulness as money.
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:19:31
It depends on how much bitcoin you have locked up in your payment channels.  The more you have locked up in you payment channels, the larger of transactions you are able to help route through your node.  Each user will have settings on their node that will allow them to set the maximum amount of fees per transaction, and will calculate a route accordingly.
So, the more you have in you channels, the more transactions you will be able to route through your node, which means you'll be able to set your fees slightly higher.  
However, like Andreas mentioned in the video, If you put too much BTC in your channels, then you become more of a target for hackers to steal your private key.  This should discourage overly-funded hubs, so that LN should be able to stay decentralized.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:39:40
Yeah, I'm a BCH supporter, and I think that's pushing it.  The real bitcoin is the one with the longest POW chain &amp; market cap.
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:58:50
Are you talking about the privacy/anonymity of the LN?
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:38:45

@_date: 2017-09-29 16:03:39
Check out the Bitcoin Gold fork.  Even if we reject 2x blocks, if more than 90% of the hashing power is mining 2x, than bitcoin gold might be the only way for the chain to survive.
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:42:55
The USD supports wars + Government corruption and is backed by government violence.  
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:34:51
Good read.  A few things though,




But if the original bitcoin chain isn't moving, then nobody can sell their 2x coins for bitcoin and in  that that case, 2x coin would have the value of bitcoin.
So it must fork to survive, and Core must push these updates out early so that exchanges can update their wallets so that people can dump 2x.
@_date: 2019-09-13 15:17:43
As long as they can't increase the supply of bitcoin, they cannot take advantage of you the same way central banks do today.
@_date: 2019-09-13 15:21:53
How long did it take to confirm?
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:36:03
I agree!
@_date: 2016-10-27 02:21:47
Have you thought of trying to double spend the transaction with a higher fee?
I think that you might be able to do this by importing the private key into a different wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:16:20
Wouldn't any upgrade require consensus from the entire ecosystem whether it be hard or soft fork?
@_date: 2017-07-15 05:32:24
It tricks the old nodes by dumping a random string into where the old witness data was supposed to go (correct me if I'm wrong on this) so it appears to the old node as valid.  The witness data is stored separate in a type of "side-chain" along side the transaction block.  There are now both the the transaction hash and the witness hash per transaction.  For example, in a 1mb blocksize, the witness data would get 3mb.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:43:29
I don't know.  Do you think that the 2mb part will activate?
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:42:33
This is awesome because small dollar amounts that aren't worth withdrawing because they can't be moved around can be put to good use.  
Check out the  demo page.  They're such an awesome payment processor for lightning, and their demo page donates to a good cause.
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:25:30
Good point.  I didn't think of that.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:50:12
I suggest that you run your node with prunning enabled.
If you really want to support Segwit, than mine with a pool that supports it.

You're probably thinking about Metcalf's Law.

@_date: 2019-05-20 06:57:32
Seriously?  I'm only suggesting as creative idea for closing out small channels, plus I don't get any of it, or am in need of.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:12:51
I think that Miners activating Segwit2x is better than miners waiting around like sitting ducks till August 1st for a network attack via contentious soft fork.
