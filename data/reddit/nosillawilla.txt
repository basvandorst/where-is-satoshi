Alts are having their fun until second layer solutions really get implemented imo. That is why we are seeing a lot of sideways trading imo, people trading bitcoin for other alts but imo that currency will be back into bitcoin once second layer gets going since bitcoin is the most popular and accepted crypto. it will take alts years to catch up to that presence that bitcoin has
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:38:21
Most definitely. Shoot, buy a few bucks even just to have some so you can understand better. I think we are on the tip of the iceberg for crypto. Bitcoin and a few other crypto currencies are gonna have a very bright 2018

@_date: 2018-01-12 06:05:28
market cap has been growing, though. people taking profits, idk. i'm hodling for the long haul so todays, weeks, months price points don't bother me much
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:45:29
I think bitcoin and crypto will be here to stay despite regulation. The US loses ~4 trillion a year in money laundering and crypto pretty much has nothing to do with that. The illegal aspects of spending bitcoin are pretty moot too considering the US dollar has just as much potential to buy seedy things with it.
I think wallstreet in the end will want to keep bitcoin deregulated. Its a wild west and wall street loves to gamble. 
Block chain tech is incredible.
Have you heard of this project? I see a direct benefit for democracy in ensuring there is no voter suppression or manipulation at the polling places. And they are gonna use the bitcoin blockchain so i hear from one of the members in microsoft. And that is just one way that the identity project can use the blockchain tech.

Get a SegWit wallet. Should help cut costs by ~40%
Also, use GDAX to transfer funds. One, it's free. Two, punish them for not implementing SegWit yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:02:30
I'm fine when people sell alt coins for bitcoin. At the very least, Bitcoin is a great store of value. Got to hodl your gainz somewhere. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:53:32
Jokes aren't dead. But I see stuff like what you said all the time and a lot of the time those people aren't joking. Keep hodling. You have a 'liberal' bitcoin ally at least in that regard.

Huh, thanks for this different perspective. That makes a lot more sense now. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:43:12
This is the right attitude to have. What's good for bitcoin is also good for altcoins and vise versa. There can totally be a symbiosis of crypto currencies out in the real world. The whole "my coin is better than your coin" logic is bad for crypto. There should only be healthy promotion.

nah, they just removed them and added them back later. bots can do all this work autonomously pretty much. Anytime a wall gets eaten into and orders start to fill then they are removed until things calm down then are added back
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:59:11
I'm trying to keep everyone calm. As a HODLer who has felt some painful drops I'm trying to tell everyone things might work out. We don't know what is going on since we can't even contact TransAmerica. Nothing in the news, and no press releases from their website or social media.

It doesn't work from Proof of Work like LTC or BTC. Transactions take 2 to 5 seconds. It doesn't mine blocks. It has been stress tested to handle the equivalent of over 40 million bitcoin transactions a day. 
"This paper introduces a new model for consensus called federated Byzantine agreement (FBA). FBA achieves
robustness through quorum slices—individual trust decisions made by each node that together determine
system-level quorums. Slices bind the system together much the way individual networks’ peering and transit
decisions now unify the Internet.
We also present the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a construction for FBA. Like all Byzantine agreement
protocols, SCP makes no assumptions about the rational behavior of attackers. Unlike prior Byzantine
agreement models, which presuppose a unanimously accepted membership list, SCP enjoys open membership
that promotes organic network growth. Compared to decentralized proof of-work and proof-of-stake
schemes, SCP has modest computing and financial requirements, lowering the barrier to entry and potentially
opening up financial systems to new participants.
CCS Concepts: •Security and privacy → Distributed systems security; Security protocols;"
Check out their white paper. It's also a non-profit run out of SF and IBM is partnered with them. It's completely different from Bitcoin/Litecoin. And the tech is really promising. It's also decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:56:44
Like a million 0.01 buys. Is someone trying to keep the price low by buying this way? Is someone trying to buy a ton to either hodl and get in at a cheap price or are they trying to collect more for another sell wall down the road? Or is someone's Coinbase app frozen and they clicked buy 1,000,000 times trying to make the transaction go through?

Idk, bitcoin is money to me. I buy stuff with it. I think it has a higher value than it does right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:31:02
It's really sad. I want my viewpoints to be challenged so I can strengthen or change them depending on what the best answer is. I side with supporting the people instead of corporations so that makes me liberal in a lot of ways. But I also think those same viewpoints follow the bitcoin belief as well that currency should belong to the people and not big banks or corporations. 
I wish this poster could entertain a rational debate but it appears its easier to bury their head then challenge their own beliefs for fear that they may have to think differently than what they are accustomed to.

If you think it will go up again then it is worth waiting and hodling. We never know when things are at their ATH or not. Everything is a catch 22. The ATH was not my selling point. I like to think that 2018 is gonna be a good year if we are patient enough
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:48:28

If you buy on coinbase for example you buy at the time you bought, even though it might take days to transact. unless you're day trading, no problem. you can also move money prematurely into your USD account if you want to try to time buys then the buys are instant. I guess what you're doing is ok but the fees irk me. I might recommend gemini as I believe you can make immediate 500 dollar buys using a bank account and fees are less than 1%

Very diversified portfolio. TransAmerica is unreachable right now. We all had retirement accounts through them and they created a portfolio for us. A month ago I had 16% returns for the year.

Miners still have a purpose. They will continue to mine blocks, but profit from transaction fees instead of block rewards(bitcoins being released)
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:49:50
regulating the market will corrupt the decentralized philosophy of bitcoin. the way we can prevent this in the future is the market cap growing of bitcoin. when bitcoin reaches a market cap of say 1 trillion it will be 5 times harder to affect the price as it is now at ~200 billion. we must hodl in the meantime

I guess it was a software glitch that misread the prices, not that things were removed. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:01:08
Yep, and as bitcoin becomes less volatile it becomes a 'safer' store of wealth. People can still play the day trading with alt coins but I like the sideways trading bitcoin has been going through and as more people buy into it we will see a slow rise and growth over time which will also help alts grow too. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:37:51

@_date: 2018-01-24 05:42:11
Use a Segwit wallet. I like electrum. It helps increase the blocksize and allows for more transactions in a block and makes your personal fee less per transaction.
Schnorr and Lightning well on their way to being mainstream. Schnorr can help cram more transactions into a block with multi-sig technology. 
Lightning is second layer and therefore works off the bitcoin blockchain but transactions on lightning take seconds instead of 10 minutes like the bitcoin blockchain and fees can be less than one cent. 
If you want to help yourself right now though, get a Segwit wallet. It makes transactions about 30% cheaper. If more people pick it up the better the Bitcoin network will be. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:11:19

@_date: 2018-01-13 03:08:12
they are gonna lose customers when people don't want to pay outrageous fees when other services using segwit can do it cheaper. word of mouth is powerful advertising -- more so than coinbase's easy ui. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:40:13
yeah it is, that's why there are huge sell walls up on GDAX to suppress the price imo

We can't ignore the fact that the housing market is considered to be over-valued anywhere from 10 to 30% across the USA. Trumps Tax Plan will also add to our national debt which we are already nearing 21 trillion dollars. I smell a bubble personally. You might be right in that the stock market will continue to thrive but I can't help but think there is going to be a collapse soon. The middle class is not doing so well which spurs much of our economy. Considering the value of the USD has fallen by 10% in 2017 and wages have not increased by 10% this year there is going to be less buying power coming out of the middle class which can effect companies.
All politics aside I am a very bullish person but I think there should be cause for concern in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:14:00
Another thing to think about the long term efficacy of our nation is automation. Self-driving cars/trucks are going to kill hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country within the next 10 years.

I just don't understand why some people refuse to compromise or hear a differing opinion. It's amazing the lengths some people will go to be on the wrong side of things simply because they refuse to listen to other perspectives. We need to start communicating to each other again. Everything doesn't have to be a conspiracy or fake news. 
At least for Reddit, there is a downvote button worst case scenario. Meanwhile Facebook is a cesspool on any news article with the most divisive comments always make their ways to the top.

Hey, I'm trying to send some funds from Binance to my bech32 Segwit wallet address. It keeps giving me a "withdraw address error"
Is this because Binance does not support Segwit or bech32?
Their support hasn't been very helpful. They keep telling me to check the FAQ section which does not have a topic on why this error is occurring. Is bech32 not widely implemented yet in this regard so there can be trouble sending to these addresses? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:09:20

It is my guess there is obvious market manipulation still taking place. Huge sell walls on Bitcoin, and false pumping (buying 20, 40 Bcash coins) on Bcash to keep the numbers high. The trade volume for Bcash is actually pretty low on Coinbase.

Invest for sure. Dont buy mining hash. You will get MUCH better returns by buyingbitcoin. I almost think of buying hash as a scam since youre basically supporting a miner for a low ROI vs buying bitcoin yourself and get more for the same amount. You will do so much better for yourself if you buy what you can afford every payday. What I speak of is dollar cost averaging.

bcash won't take over. ripple is about to take over ethereum in number 2 position though. but the bitcoin blockchain is still an important piece of tech. there is a lot of market manipulation from futures trading right now with bitcoin. the price is being suppressed imo with huge sell walls keeping it below 15k. anytime it hits 15k which has happened twice tonight it is immediately met with a new sell wall. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:14:43
BCH has a malleability issue because LN needs SegWit in order for it to work and BCH does not have that at this moment. SegWit also increases the block size to 1.7mb so there will be some scaling solutions there. SegWit and LN are just two scaling solutions. There are active developments into Third layer scaling solutions that step above LN even and have some interesting futuristic properties outside of currency transactions, even. 
With SegWit and LN being widely adopted I can see a huge majority of transactions being done on the second layer which will help the congestion on the blockchain. 
Keeping under 2mb for a blockchain makes a ton of sense since after we start to get past 2mb it is hard not for nodes to be decentralized as the data and bandwidth required to run a node would be enormous. I run a full node at home for Bitcoin and I can easily push 250 to 300gb a month in uploads. That's just for a 1mb Blockchain. Imagine 4mb or even 8mb as some people are talking about that. No way can a person run a node like that. Nodes would then be run from data centers making it centralized which is not good. 54% of nodes for Bcash are in China running on Alibaba virtual servers. It is already centralized from the get go.

we really need to start talking about Segwit. I guarantee you EVERY user of Coinbase does not want to spend more fees than they have to for a transaction even if they don't know what Segwit is. As one of the largest exchanges you can *really* make a difference through Segwit implementation and your customers will stay vs finding a different service/wallet that can offer better transactions because of Segwit implementation.

Hodlers need to keep holding and buying on dollar cost averaging while we wait for scaling technology to catch up to the transaction volume as more people start to adopt bitcoin and boom, bitcoin skyrockets again. I think CME is going to help boost the price of bitcoin as I'm sure there are a lot of traders wanting to bet the long price as there is a ton of resistance for shorting it as there are a ton of people wanting to buy on the dips(looking at buy orders for 15.5k and under. )

Definitely, but BCH is a short term solution to scaling while better developers are working on long term scaling solutions. Bcash has the upper hand for now by having an extra lane on the highway, but with second layer solutions getting close to completion with Bitcoin we aren't talking a highway with more lanes we are talking a new means of transportation altogether. Mass transit, bike lanes, rail, flying vs adding more car lanes. The goal for bitcoin is to have less cars on the road altogether. That is why I think bitcoin will succeed in the long term.

if you buy stuff with bitcoin you are still paying a sales tax just like you would with any other fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:00:25
Well, we are already subject to inflation. A gallon of milk or a pair of jeans already costs more every year than it did in the past. If one day bitcoin were to completely replace the US dollar or other currencies, then yes we would be in an interesting circumstance where the early adopters were more successful than people getting in to the game. I don't think that's a bad thing necessarily though as bitcoin could just replace the value of the dollar. So say that bitcoin replaced all currencies you would just be paid a value in bitcoin instead of the US dollar. It wouldn't affect peoples lives accept for those who bought in early

bitcoin isn't in a bubble. it's a deflationary currency with limited assets. as demand increases, the price rises since there are only so many bitcoin. just hold for the long haul and don't worry too much about day-to-day prices. we are already getting near all time highs today with 17,200 prices
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:09:55
i think when the technology gets implemented on a bigger scale this won't be such an issue. the market cap of 250 billion is quite small compared to the 200 trillion dollar us stock market cap. that is a 8,000 percent different in cap. and futures isn't necessarily destroying bitcoin. i kind of like the sideways trading since it allows spending of the currency at a less volatile price. 
and just remember, this can't last forever. 2018 is gonna be a whole new year. I'm very happy for bitcoin for what it has done this year. 2018 is only gonna get better imo.

The vendor on the other side taking your payment is taking a risk just as much as you are, yet you can literally book a vacation around the world with Bitcoin and buy tons of shit with it including houses and cars. With 2nd layer scaling we will be able to do even small transactions rather affordably. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:44:52
if you have 100 to put in, then do it all at once. and hold for a long period of time to get good returns.

Good work bitcoin community for lighting a fire under their ass. Lets hold them accountable to implementing as quickly as possible

Bitcoin has went up over 40% this week and over 2,000% this year lol. Those are incredible gains. I'll take 40% per week gains for the year, thanks.

You can help out though by using SegWit wallets

The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago, the second best time to plant one is today. If you can afford the risk, then I would definitely buy. All time high this, all time high that, waiting for the dip is a bad move because in a year from now the bitcoin price will be much different than it is today
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:54:55
lol, it's not a religious belief but more a philosophical belief in the technology that by being an early adopter you have the most benefit and by sticking through someday you won't ever have to sell your bitcoins back for USD. You can book a vacation around the world, furnish your house, buy cars and any technological device you want with bitcoin. In a few more years I bet you can pretty much pay for almost everything in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:27:03
It looks like the foundation will be using the bitcoin blockchain as the backbone of the decentralized ID network(Head of decentralized identity at Microsoft strongly hinted that bitcoin would be used). Voter suppression may one day be a thing of the past. This was really hard for me to comprehend since it is such a new idea, but it is very intriguing how cryptography and block chain technology can end voter suppression and allow for 100% accurate voting systems that are absent of manipulation using a trustless and decentralized network. Voting is one small usage of a new technology such as this but that in its own is very important for the future of democracy. 
With companies like Microsoft, IDEO and IBM working together to make a system owned by no one with open source code but able to be trusted by everyone for identification and verification is really, really interesting!

Pretty much. It is what it is. Shoot i have ripple myself. But it is not Bit coins competitor in no way. It's completely different since it is centralized

@_date: 2017-12-29 06:58:02
I see where you're coming from, but I'm gonna have to disagree with you. I have some friends who bought in late who are upset with the price not going to the 'moon' but if you explain to them that we are in it for the long haul and that even though the hype on bitcoin is mainstream the technology isn't completely implemented they understand we are still in the early adoption phase. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:56:37

get coinbase then use gdax for zero fees same company but gdax is their exchange
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:55:53
please implement SegWit. Coinbase has a lot of clout and your service would really make a difference if SegWit was implemented as fees are ever-increasing with the user base. It would be no hair off Coinbases back to do this and a huge difference would be made. Please continue to be pioneers! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:59:22
Sure you are. Also if true, a great time to buy

They've been wanting to since the fork. And there are paid accounts and vote manipulation on top of many other things to try to spread FUD and fear. I don't think it is them though as this is MILLIONS of dollars being spent to keep a price point. I think it is the futures people trying to manipulate the market. Most people are playing smart and HODLING through this. I think we will hit 20k by Christmas time. Let's see!

thanks for sharing this. Huh. 4mb blocks? This is how you get centralized nodes. I run a full node at home and I easily push over 300gb of data a month. If I ran a 4mb block I would be pushing terabytes in uploads a month. No way can a home user support that.

@_date: 2017-12-30 14:00:51
Meanwhile merchants pay 3% on credit card transactions. Many merchants offer slight discounts on sales for using bitcoin. I don't see the point you are trying to make. Centrallized vs decentralized currencies makes the p2p user pay the transaction fee instead of the merchant. And if you're a believer in second layer solutions, your attitude probably wouldn't be like this.

Can't help but think this is a short and lots of panic selling from everyone else. A lot of people are getting weak hands and jumping ship. I think of this as a great time to buy personally. Just know where the bottom is is anyones guess.

The panic selling is over and hesitant buyers are seeing that bitcoin is on sale. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:55:05
Well you are supporting the network. Even if the blockchain is 160gb when other people get nodes or use the core wallet they need someone to send them the information of the full blockchain so they can provide consensus too. Same idea with torrenting on a p2p network. Say a book I torrent is 30mb but yet I can upload gigabytes more than the original file size because I'm supporting the network.

I'm fine with death, personally. I'm just saying that the chance of this working is incredibly small but some people are willing to bet huge on it if they have money to throw away when they are near death. I mean, why not, right? But cells are incredible little things. And they are also extremely delicate and near impossible to repair, that is why your body constantly generates new ones. The brain is going to be impossible to recover without losing everything. I am a skeptic, yes. But only because I know of the chances of this actually working. Its not like we can repair people like we can to Shepherd in Mass Effect 2 and I don't know if we ever could. No one wants to die but chasing immortality is a fools errand. Nothing lasts forever and we must learn to find comfort in eventual death.

@_date: 2017-12-21 05:09:09
lol, explain the high transaction backlog then? with 2nd layer scaling coming soon, it will be a great currency for even smaller transactions. i would still more than gladly buy a house or another high dollar purchase with bitcoin right now despite the high fees because of its security. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:07:12
Ha, buy through the sell walls. If you think bitcoin will go up, not a bad price point to buy right now 
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:16:09
basically someone wants to sell a large amount of coins at a certain price. For instance the 1,500 bitcoin sell wall set at 17,250. On the GDAX exchange it looks like a literal wall of red that people have to buy the entire volume of to surpass it and raise the price of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:26:41
coordinated attack to pump Bcash. Spam transactions, take away hash power for mining, pump Bcash and do a little insider trading with an exchange called Coinbase while getting Roger Ver on the news to say that Bitcoin is terrible and to buy Bcash instead

@_date: 2017-12-14 14:01:47
it all depends, we can only speculate. i'm just thinking that lesser bandwidth sites won't be targeted initially. i am not brushing this off because i really do love the internet the way it is and i am just as concerned as you are. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:48:08
yes, i thought this was important too. i know a lot of people are on the sidelines wanting in and ready to buy any dip.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:20:09
You're right. It's a bit ridiculous. Also I feel like some of it is intentional and misdirecting. We have lightning coming out soon that will drastically reduce fees and transaction times. We just need to be patient. ALSO another important thing to think of is that a lot of businesses who accept bitcoin give you 5 to 15% off on purchases so a lot of time you are still saving money despite the transaction fees. Cheers. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:05:29

Tons of sell walls. If people were jumping ship they would be selling at any price point, not waiting for it to get back up to a certain price to sell. Anyone else think the price is being kept around here for futures trading?
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:34:04
If you are a verified account you can stop limitations based on scale of verification. Also, just because you can only withdraw 10k a day with some verifications, it does not stop the fact that you can't make a million dollar sale. You'll just have to get it off the exchange over time or contact the exchange itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:23:40
use GDAX. Your coinbase login will work for GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:55:31
i bought some more too.

I love the blockchain tech. It's a very secure way to transfer money. It's faster than a wire typically (especially international and people joke that hopping on a plane with a check is faster than those wires) and I think it has other tech values that make it an important future for currency. I'm a believer in crypto and Bitcoin, that's why I use it for more than just a store of value. As second and third layer scaling solutions become implemented, Bitcoin will be a very strong contender for currency though right now Bitcoin *is* experiencing growing pains but I can imagine by the end of 2018 we will not be talking about high transaction times. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:31:31

@_date: 2017-12-15 11:00:06
No, you could totally sell 60 bitcoin today if you wanted to. You would have cash sitting in the exchange that might take a while to get off depending on the transfer limit you have.

Get a personal wallet. Trezor, ledger good ones or try a SegWit wallet. Then move your coins from Coinbase to the Gdax exchange because it is then free to transfer from there to your personal wallet. Then you can sign up for the Gemini service and do transactions through there.

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:18:46
A massive back and forth trade. My guess a lot of people converting BCH to bitcoin since bitcoin is low right now and a good buy if you're looking for a dip. Cuz right now people have had to sell their BCH and then buy btc. Being able to transfer directly one coin to another will make things a lot easier 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:12:43
lol not really I didn't say they should buy or sell. Just that at the end of the day it should be them making that call and not someone on reddit who they've never met before

we already went through that a few days ago. you must be new here :3
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:00:25
Just buy and HOLD. Bitcoin is appreciating all the time. Day trading puts you at a much larger risk because if you get a sell wrong and buy back at a higher price than selling points you are LOSING. I would only recommend day-trading with what you are mentioning with MAX 1/4 of your bitcoins and hold the rest long term. I have only bought more or spent it, never sold it back for USD because you are playing a riskier game by doing so.

I think there are a lot of people ready to buy on the dip. I don't think the price will tank below 10k. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:18:06
i think when BCH/BTC trading goes live around 9am PST things are gonna get crazy again. But seriously for those reading who are getting nervous stop looking at the prices and come back in a few weeks.

@_date: 2017-12-15 10:26:16
 here is the one i'm watching and you can see a big sell wall at 18k. 
And yeah with CME I expect the price to stay pretty steady as what  has been happening this past week or there is a massive surge in buying as people look to bet a long position. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:06:09
dude, losing net neutrality is a bigger deal than you think. it's not just netflix and reddit, it is the consumer who also want to preserve net neutrality. idk about you, but i like the internet the way it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:22:56
Nah, it's just a different class with the wealth. Considering that 1% of the people in the US own 40% of the wealth already does not concern me that new people are getting to have some type of wealth. I don't think there will be a class warfare like you might think there will be. Late stage capitalism wants you to oppress for more money through business. Investing in a technology is a different source of wealth generation. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:50:17
looks like you hit the bottom of this dip. Payday is friday for a lot of people and I think we are gonna get another small pump boosting us past 16k by end of day.

If you have tens of millions of dollar to spare, you can influence the market. This would also happen in the stock markets but it is illegal. Crypto is the wild west. We are still up over 140% this month so I'm not tripping. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:31:29
If you make under 38k a year I think there is a way to live off of your investment gains without being taxed but I don't think you can sell outright. I would instead try to buy as much as I can with bitcoin to get buy. Expedia, Overstock, Newegg etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:20:54
We just need to be patient and not panic sell. Things will swing up again. For those reading-- you only lose money if you sell. In a month or two, I can see us past 20k. Bitcoin has exceeded all expectations already for this year. And we are only getting started.

Buyer fatigue? That was a ton of money to burn through the wall. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:43
No one can tell you what to do with your money but I am going to hold. Why? Crypto Currency this year has outdone ALL expectations and I believe it will continue to do so. Seeing all cryptos down tells me that Bitcoin isn't dying and instead the market is down right now, which does happen quite often in any market. I encourage you to look back to the monthly timelines to see the impressive gains we have had.
If you are still concerned and you only put in what you can afford to lose then I encourage you to turn off your exchange and find ways not to check the price every 5 minutes. Things will recover imo. There is too much going for crypto currencies for them to disappear. HODL! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:28:11
No one has any clue what's gonna happen. I think the opposite will happen when futures goes live

Crypto dips ain't nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:53:35
Yes, imo. There are tons of false sell walls that disappear once they start to be carved away. Futures trading started with CBOE, CME and those playing a short position could have definitely bought 10's of millions in bitcoin to create these false sell walls of 200-300 each time you see one. it's a way to try to anchor a price.

Do you remember what happened in 2009? Everyone's 401k took a shit. And I fear around 2019 the stock market will take another shit. Investing anything always has a risk. Just some are higher than others. I am fine with Bitcoin's volatile growth as adoption grows. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:44:25

if you use coinbase move your coins to the gdax exchange and transfer them off of that exchange for free. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:40:00
probably futures market manipulation to keep the price at certain points. Someone REALLY doesn't want to see the price go above 18k. The same thing happened last night with a 1k bitcoin sell wall at 17,250. We broke through it around 5AM PST and we are going through the same thing again now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:43:11

bad advice. I bought at the previous all time high of 5,400, 7,200 and 9k. It's now 12k. Think I'm mad? Waiting for the dip to buy is bad advice. Better to buy and hold. If there is a dip then I would consider spending extra to buy it. But if I'm waiting to invest the time is always now since you can only speculate if there will be a dip. But Bitcoin has always risen past the previous all time highs. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:41:54
No one really has a clue. We can only guess. I think it will,keep rising. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:54:58
if you move your coins from coinbase to GDAX and withdraw to your wallet the transfer is FREE. coinbase and GDAX use the same account credentials. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:07:20
lol, with segwit and LN, fees won't be that high. if the majority of smaller transactions happen on a LN network, that could easily clear up half of the transactions on the blockchain. And with SegWit allowing up to 4 times the amount of transactions in a block Bitcoin is looking pretty good. When is the big question, though. I think it's soon, personally. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:29:25
Yep. They are profiting on both sides from this. CME goes live on the 18th. It's gonna be interesting seeing if whoever is doing this can keep it up as there might be someone betting big on a long position that will pierce through future sell walls. Also not to mention that a lot of normal people are adopting bitcoin and starting to buy too. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:37:51

I think it is important we discuss of attacks against Bitcoin because they are illuminating to the community and it allows us to better defend them through knowledge divvying. I agree something in the sidebar would be better but I consider stuff like these comments from Roger as news and worth sharing/discussing as it does pertain to Bitcoin.

huh, interesting. thanks
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:51:48
Its gonna be on coinbase. I read it somewhere on this sub Reddit. Looking at the GDAX exchange it is an option that is blank(no trading) but I hear they are rolling it out today. We will see I guess 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:57:35

@_date: 2017-12-27 01:43:05
Yep just transaction fees
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:55:27
This is illegal typically. But basically they can just put huge sell walls of coins up that have been bought over time to keep a price locked at a certain point. That, or someone with a lot of coins wants out. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:51:03
1,000 at 18k. We broke through 400 at 17,250 in like an hour. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:08:38
I was just about to say this too. Interesting the number is at 17,250 AGAIN. Market manipulation anyone? Someone must be betting big that Bitcoin won't get to 18k. Not to be a conspiracy theorist or anything.

Lol nah. Apples to oranges. Bit coin is a decentralized currency. Ripple is centralized 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:49:28
They do a default 7 days. Basically there are no charge backs in the bitcoin world once a transaction goes through so they need to be 100% sure a transfer cleared even if yours went through earlier than 7 days. Your price is locked in at the time you bought it though
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:16:35

To be honest I will be happy to see us at 16k for the end of the year. We have had an AMAZING year for Bitcoin. Now that the world is catching on, it would be foolish to think that 2018 would be any different. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:36:07
Yes, but there are those who will prey on newcomers of crypto currency and I would rather protect them and let them figure it out for themselves vs being purposely lured into buying something (an altcoin) that is being advertised as something else.
IE telling someone they are gonna buy a BMW M3 when it is infact a used Ford Pinto with some body mods.

Hang in there. If you believe in the technology, the upcoming scaling solutions, the decentralized store of assets, then hodl on to your coins. Last month bitcoin was at 7,200 then dipped hard to 5,400. People were super worried then. In less than a week bitcoin hit 10k. Bitcoin is super volatile. There will be ups and downs. But only you will know what you think is best. But I'm gonna hang on for now personally
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:57:53
I was told from Coinbase it would be January 1st, 2018. Not December 19th. That and a few other reasons is why I am led to believe that at a minimum collusion has taken place between Coinbase and Bcash. I mean, CME gave us a pretty specific date when they would start futures. They didn't suddenly just start trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:30:29
I am glad when you google bitcoin the bitcoin.org site is a few sites above of bitcoin.com. I'm not sure how we keep it that way but I think that is important to do.

Basically Bcash is a centrallized currency with a CEO. Bitcoin is a decentralized and open source platform. Bcash defeats the purpose of the white papers for temporary scalability solutions while heavily marketing against Bitcoin to confuse new adopters of crypto into buying their product. Nothing wrong with an alt coin, but the problem lies in that they claim Bcash is Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-15 10:53:22
It's a very interesting theory at the very least. No one really knows what's gonna happen but I'm gonna guess is this dude is applying experience in futures trading to what might happen next to bitcoin with these rather prominent sell walls.

i was watching it. someone ate through over 1,000 of them and there was only about 110 left before i went to get a drink of water. when i came back it was gone either removed or eaten up in a minute. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:09:14
and behavior like this is exactly why i can't support bitcoin cash when a lunatic is the CEO. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:24:42
Not necessarily it depends. An ISP might breeze over coinbase or trading platforms compared to using higher bandwidth sites like video streaming services. No one really knows what's gonna happen with *every* website but that is my guess. We will have to pay more for sites that use higher bandwidth. Other websites might get a pass, at least for now
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:44:45
A lot are doing that. And I think when the BCH/BTC opens on Coinbase it will make another leap too. Still some plausible market manipulation going on but it looks like Bitcoin has been a honey badger today 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:22:27
This is a question found in the FAQ  but basically once all bitcoins are mined miners will make money through transaction costs. I suggest you read the FAQ as there is a ton of cool info. Take care.

@_date: 2017-12-14 10:10:30
Market manipulation in my opinion from futures trading. Someone bet big on a short and doesn't want to lose. Hang in there though as this is temporary and CME is going live on the 17th/18th. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:41:30
Depends how much you have to transfer. I'd probably just wait as Electrum is a pretty safe wallet. As long as you have multiple backups of your seed you should be alright. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:25:23
I was trying to be conservative, but yeah, it definitely could happen way sooner than that!

Last month bitcoin dipped down from 7,200 to 5,400 and then reached to 10k within 5 days.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:42:55
if you claim that your fork is the original bitcoin, yeah. i would be advertising that bcash is something different than bitcoin (which it is) instead of trying to say that bcash is the true bitcoin. i am not averse to different crypto currencies it is just how things are being handled that is upsetting and i believe a lot of newcomers are going to get confused and spend their money on something that is different from what they think they are getting. do you get the point i'm trying to make? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:30:06
they mine blocks which hold the transactions. so each time you make a transaction there is a small fee that goes to the miner for processing the block that holds your transactions. a block is the core principal for blockchain technology

Top 15 coins are all in the red. Don't panic thinking that Bitcoin is the only one falling. Hang in there and consider it a good time to buy if you are looking for the dip and only spend what you can afford to not get hurt by. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:15:02
For LN to work. We need Segwit. I heard if SegWit is fully adopted that essentially increases the block size to 1.7mb

@_date: 2017-12-22 10:46:27
if you are expecting life changing results in two weeks then you are in bitcoin for the wrong reasons. it took the bitcoin millionaires years to realize their own gains and many still hodl instead of selling. don't know what else to tell you other then offer some perspective and to relax.

Electrum is a good software one that supports Segwit. Otherwise I would buy a Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:58:37
the price could definitely and probably will go up higher, imo. i have bought at 3 previous all time highs and i haven't regretted where i'm at. i'd buy more but i already bought my allotment for this week ;p
just remember to only spend what you can afford to lose, worst case scenario.

@_date: 2017-12-21 10:07:49
debatable. Bitcoin is a honey badger and is staying strong just around 17k. I can see us getting back up there
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:19:27
We just need to be patient and not panic sell. Things will swing up again. For those reading-- you only lose money if you sell. In a month or two, I can see us past 20k. Bitcoin has exceeded all expectations already for this year. And we are only getting started.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:58:24
You have to buy it. Nothing in life is free, especially from internet strangers. Read the sidebar and the FAQ

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:51:58
I use coinbase and GDAX all the time. I have not come across any of those problems. If you dont like the coinbase fees and are in the US, use GDAX.

yeah i haven't heard of any of this officially. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:40:03
SegWit is available. If you move your coins to a SegWit wallet you are helping out and youbwill enjoy decreased transaction fees 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:36:52
This would essentially make SegWit upgrades for exchanges too since a lot of them use core wallets if I am not mistaken.

I think mid 2018 we will see a lot of changes in Bitcoin. It's a definite sink or swim moment. But I'm still looking forward to the technology regardless of price. I think a lot of people have been blinded by greed
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:44:36
Bad advice waiting around for a dip that may or may not happen. If you have money to spend that you can afford to lose then buy whenever. I bought at the previous all time highs of 5,400, 7,200 and 9,100. Think I feel bad now that the price is 12,333? Think again! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:31:41
What is so bad about calling it Bcash? I think it sounds way better than bitcoin cash and it helps to differentiate the two coins so people aren't as confused as to which is which. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:12:02
I dollar cost average. I don't wait for dips because half the time you're gonna get burned waiting for something that might not happen or if it does dip it never gets below the number you were thinking it was going to. Better to just buy in what you can afford and dollar cost average. I have bought at previous all time highs of 5,400, 7,200, 9,100 and 12k. Think I'm sad? Better not wait for the dips and just buy in what you can afford.

it will but for how long? and if it dips, does it go back up? all we can really do is guess like anything in life. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:41:39
I think we have a sticky on here that shows some of the easiest ways to buy bitcoin. Sorry you are going through a hassle trying to get into the cryptocurrency world. I use coinbase initially because they really make it *so* easy to buy and store bitcoin. 
But yes, getting into the crypto world right now is like learning a new skill. It takes time, but once you understand it you can be quite proficient. 
I will circle back to Coinbase as an easy way to get started and head into GDAX exchange once you become proficient enough to really get going from there.
Cheers and goodluck!

@_date: 2017-11-28 12:54:27
it's deflationary so supply and demand is completely different from the norm. also it's a currency so it can be spent like money because it is money. the bubble people speak of is the increased demand for it but the rise in price is due to a finite supply. as more people read about bitcoin more will want to use it. i see myself travelling the world and never having to exchange for normal paper money wherever i go and i can buy everything with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:38:07

dont just buy in dips. buy all the time. i read a thing saying that if you bought 10 dollars worth of bitcoin everyday starting in January of this year you would have 38,000 dollars worth of bitcoin today. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:14:07
what if it doesn't drop? what if it keeps going up? in the long term it's better to always buy now and to keep buying when you can afford to instead of waiting for the dips

The average is 10 minutes to an hour for 6 confirmations. But when making a purchase it could really be up to the vendor as to how many puzzles in the blockchain they want to confirm transfers. A pending transaction shows up in seconds to minutes but can take longer to process. It takes sometimes days for transactions to get approved when I use my credit or debit cards.

Because of the monopoly on ASIC miners. Only one company really owns all the miners. It is true the more you scale more profit you get I think that if we can get actual cost miners it wont be so terribly expensive. Also, I mine ether with my pc at home and make 40 dollars a month after paying for power. It can be doable. I just mine to help out and speculate on a long term gain on ether like bitcoin. I would mine bitcoin if I could with my pc.

You are speaking of the top end of transaction prices that have been artificially inflated due to spamming. Transactions and times are usually not this high and won't be in a few days. Usually transactions are quite reasonable. You can also set up your transaction prices too. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:07:35
That's fair. I guess I am just getting tired of the 30 other comments mentioning the transaction fees and costs which are *temporary* from spamming. It wasn't like this a few days ago even. There is nothing wrong with using other coins but I tired from giving the same response over and over. You might be sincere, but I can tell you at least 1/3 of them were not. There has been a ton of manipulation on this subreddit lately with verified hacking and vote manipulation. Excuse me for being weary. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:17:40
We really need another ASIC manufacturer to come along to help get out of the miner monopoly. I would gladly operate a miner even at a loss if it meant for more stable currency. I only am able to mine ether at the moment with my system.

Get a good graphics card and mine alt coins using nice hash. Perfect setup for a hobby miner. You need at least 1,500 bucks to make some profits for bitcoin as you need a special miner.

So glad I bought in the dip. If there are any take a ways from the BCH attempted heist is that as much as they hate bitcoin core they helped me make more money. So thanks. (Sorry, had to pick at that fresh scab)

Cuz there is a finite supply of bitcoin and bcc is an alt coin. The money will come back to bitcoin az it always does imo

@_date: 2017-11-28 08:16:39
Wow, you sound like a very nervous person. Perhaps you should keep your money in bonds if you are that worried. I personally am not concerned and I believe the value will continue to rise. If people don't know how to spend with bitcoin then show them how. It's an amazing currency. I use it to buy stuff all the time and always ask business owners who don't accept it to consider it. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:34:32
What was the transaction fee a month ago? I believe the fee is artificially high right now

@_date: 2017-11-13 07:46:18
and prices are low so people want to buy in the dip
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:29:24
I would sell those and buy ether or litecoin for now since they are stable and also trending upwards then when the transaction queue calms down sell those for bitcoin. another day or two and these transaction queues won't be so bad

@_date: 2017-11-11 02:51:08
Yep. Buying low and selling high has been standard practice in investing since forever. Knowing WHEN to buy and WHEN to sell is the subjective part of investing. I personally agree in buying in the dip. I know the prices will start to go back up. But also, I'm not trying to make money for today. I'm trying to make money for tomorrow. So hold on and play smart. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:22:37

Roger Ver is an absolute psychopath. But he can't top bitcoin. His last attack dropped bitcoin to 5,400 and now it is almost to 10k at around 9,900. If the price drops, there will be billions of dollars on the sidelines to buy bitcoin back up. I'm not worried. Transaction service might get slowed here and there but that's about it. In a few months with Lightning coming that will make it much more difficult for him to do. Also, by spamming the transactions he is spending millions of dollars in transaction fees to keep it up. It is artificial and is very expensive. There is a huge push for bitcoin right now around the world. If Roger can somehow make bitcoin dip I will be one of the first people buying.

I don't think this is sustainable. It is costing millions of dollars to keep these spammed transactions up and as I hear BCH blockchain difficulties will continue to rise to the point where going back to BTC will be the more profitable move to mine. Miners want money. I think they will come back after their little get rich quick scheme with a dash of collusion.

I say only pull out what you need if you are short on cash in the real world. I will continue to keep buying every paycheck and investing. I think it will only go up, especially due to the fact that Bitcoin amounts are finite. And more and more merchants are picking up Bitcoin, Ether and LTC. My favorite taco truck is taking Bitcoin now for tacos. I have a Roth IRA for traditional retirement investing but since that is maxed out I am putting any extra savings into Bitcoin and Ether right now. With news of Amazon possibly picking up cryptocurrency I can assume that the prices will continue to grow as merchants want more avenues for money. Especially since credit cards are becoming high fee and chargebacks are a problem. 
I also see cities and real estate companies using crypto possibly in the future to try to curb financial fees for large purchases. For instance a city might spend 2 million dollars on a project but might have to spend 10 to 20 thousand dollars in fees to get the money vs a few cents to dollars per bitcoin transaction.
I am very hopeful. But we just have to hang in there. What do you think? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:55:00

I love to live the modest lifestyle. I don't need a lot of things. But when I do buy things I try to make sure I buy the best quality or longest lasting items I can get. I think this is also important as it reduces waste over time as I throw less stuff away which is good for Mother Earth. But yes, I think holidays like 'black friday' are terrible consumeristic ideals that we shouldn't follow.

I'm gonna answer your second question first.
I think with lightning technology transaction fees will become lesser as volume of transactions increases. Miners will in turn make ~ the sameish amount as it becomes more efficient to mine despite the volume increase.
And to answer your first question last... As the value for bitcoin increases and I think will plataue, people will be purchasing in fractions of bitcoins. Maybe a coffee one day might cost .0000001 bitcoin but it is a possibility. I think a digital currency will one day be the norm though. Also, I think at a certain point we won't be buying it with our fiat money and instead be exchanging it with one another as intended.

you make some interesting points here. but in the end i am thinking of BTC as your savings account and BCH (if it even survives)more like your debit card. But Eth or LTC could easily do that work too. I like that BTC can take time for transactions by its design. I think BTC is where we will store our assets. There are other alt coins that need to define themselves more to try to fill other roles. That's just my two cents though. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:03:42
i don't think it's gonna dip. i would just skim and sell only what you need to get buy and hold on to the rest. if you sold now you might hate yourself when it could be at 15k in december.

@_date: 2017-11-11 07:55:05
With miners doing BCH at the moment and shit tons of micro transactions the network can get slowed down. I was watching the live block chain for a while. There were tons of spam transactions going for like .0002 bitcoin. It takes just as much processing power to transact .0002 bitcoin as it does for 400.57 bitcoin. It is almost like a DDOS. But I think it is gonna get resolved once more miners come back and BCH try not to sabotage the game. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:00:30
Hey thanks! That book might be fun to dabble with. My estimation that by 2025 bitcoin will be worth 100k to 500k. Depending if nations and companies start to store some of their GDP into it and as more vendors pick up crypto support for transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:03:55

Well of course they would say something like that. Crypto currency is a direct threat to banking institutions because if people start storing more money in crypto the banks lose out on profits for playing the stocks with peoples savings accounts. My Savings account is 0.5% interest. Meanwhile they probably make a cool 7% a year with it. 
It is in a banks best interest to speak against Bitcoin and crypto currency.

same age as you. if we are wrong we are wrong and are young enough to recover. it's not a bubble though. we can't look at bitcoin like any stock. it's a deflationary currency with real intrinsic and life changing technologies. as more people adopt it the stronger it gets.

They speculate normally. They have all kinds of funds and investments from low risk to high risk like investing in bitcoin. 7% savings is a moderate risk investment. 10% and more a year is considered high risk. Most investors go for moderate risk. I can guarantee that banks are doing all of it and if they ever collapse they can always get bailed out by the government like what happened in 2009.

People probably pay 2 or 3 times the cost of say something from Ikea. But they might only have say an ikea desk for 5 years before it starts to wear out and get wobbly. With my desk, you can give it to your children and grandchildren if you build things right and maintain the finishes. 
i'm trying to bring back the old way of doing things right the first time.
thanks a lot! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:12:41
they are losing money too though stop with the fud and hold on
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:02:41
Well of course they would say something like that. Crypto currency is a direct threat to banking institutions because if people start storing more money in crypto the banks lose out on profits for playing the stocks with peoples savings accounts. My Savings account is 0.5% interest. Meanwhile they probably make a cool 7% a year with it.
It is in a banks best interest to speak against Bitcoin and crypto currency.
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:05:49
Not necessarily. And Bitcoin shouldn't be centralized. By the blockchain itself it does not matter who mines it. It is secure and you put the trust in the network. But as more people mine the better and more secure the network becomes. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:30:24
yeah, i don't blame the government. i mean, they need money from taxes so of course they would say something like that. i think the government if they were to regulate bitcoin it would be to ensure that they get their taxes from it. i don't think they'd even try to kill it

Insider trading much ?
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:39:54
3 to 4 transactions a second? lol it was up to over 10 times that earlier tonight. also, this is why we must be patient for lightning implementation. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:15:16
THE DIP! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:09:21
*high five* thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:42:19
I bought some more. I don't think it's stopping anytime soon. But that's just me. PS, I also bought in the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:41:58
I have all that . I have a decent job. But you're right there are definitely other fees. To avoid capital gains I can always make an S corporation ;p

Ah I guess Gemini then or blockfolio ? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:33:42
??? got a link to that. i saw coinbase speak at a senate hearing and they knocked it out of the park and i've also seen the coinbase ceo speak on the news and was also very well-spoken. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:06:44
It's because right now a mass of miners went to gobble up profits on BCH. They will come back to bitcoin in my opinion soon. The more miners in the system the faster these transactions gets processed. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:36:16
It is sticky'd on the front page. As a reminder before posting on any subreddit, try to find the FAQ or sticky page as a way to find answers before posting. There are a bunch of links listed in here you can check out. Goodluck

Good question. I don't know. Since the code is open source I dont know if the name itself waz copyrighted
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:38:04
coinbase! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:58:51
You are updating to the new blockchain. The blockchain is now around 150gb from 80gb because it logs all the bitcoin transactions ever, basically and makes it more secure over time
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:18:16
Pretty shameful. We just have to weather the storm, eh?

hellz yeah! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:48:53
Spend only what you can risk losing. But yeah I would do it personally. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:41:08
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:19:16
Times are different now, and there is so much coming into Bitcoin right now it won't be toppled like you think it is. Regardless, I'm buying the hell out of that dip and I know millions of other people around the world will too. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:49:11
Buy the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:20:06
as a long term  investment buying today wouldn't hurt. just spend what you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:45:50
I agree with you. I have grown weary in the past 48 hours. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:24:16
I wish people could lose gracefully. This is just bad taste with all of the salty attitudes. So much so they feel inclined to harass everyone on here.

if that is the case i'll keep buying

These are my thoughts too. Miners are gonna come back to Bitcoin very soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:04:48
this is just temporary to help out the network. i usually am on ether mining

I think so. But only spend what you can afford to lose. I think it's gonna keep going up. Better jump on the train now. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:43:52
I also have stake in Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:41:19
It is collusion because a lot of BTC miners went offline to mine BCH. But it will be back in a day or two. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:43:43

For security in the transaction basically. You get an instant notice on transactions usually but they take at least 10 minutes for one block time to be solved to up to an hour for 6 blocks to be solved and verified for the transaction to complete.
When I buy something with my debit card, it can take days for my checking account balance to reflect that.

i'm certainly optimistic
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:56:22
I lost the link, but they are looking at 12 hours before difficulty jumps 400 PERCENT. I'm sure some will have switched back well before then.

i don't think it will fall so much at this point as there is a lot of people wanting in and mass adoption is starting to happen.

@_date: 2017-11-12 13:11:31
I don't think so. There is still a huge community behind bitcoin and arent going to jump ship over a few days no matter the stranglehold on the market. We have passionate vested holders and a team of great developers who work hard to make good code while BCH is smoke and mirrors over profiteering helped out by a cartel. 
But yes, I think possibly developers should work with new manufacturers to make mining easier for the average Joe to try to get behind and for larger miners to be disrupted(at least the cartel ones)

credit card fraud is much more common than bitcoin wallet fraud and is much more secure. for some businesses it accounts up to 15 to 20% of their losses ie. grocery shopping is a big one.

I've been watching the live feed on cryptowat.ch for hours now. Bitcoin is not in a total free fall. I would be worried if it hit 3k or something. But if it gets down to 5k I would start buying. At the very least I'm doing nothing and holding on for the ride. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:44:06

you aren't outright losing it but it is a calculated risk. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:43:23
they also drove the fees up by congesting the network. i think the fees are gonna go down on top of the time it takes to do a transaction. like 5 days ago things were working fine.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:09:31
just because the value increases doesn't mean you can't use it for currency still. you will just be paying for things in a fraction of a bitcoin. say a coffee one day might cost .00008 bitcoin or w/e. it still serves a purpose. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:49:00
and they can trade other cryptos for bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:03:26

Hey, I did say that if you didn't believe me the best thing to do is follow what you think is best and not the opinion of others. This is borderline stuff right now. The market isn't the only thing that's volatile right now. It is also some of the community members of bitcoin who are trying to splinter.

some people are selling, others are buying when it is low. both sides are taking huge risks. but i think buying or just holding on and not selling will pay out more. i am sort of a rookie at this too. but this is my gut talking to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:54:30
Yea, this is what I believe totally happened. Just made himself richer. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:44:24
yeah, but they have to buy bitcoin first in order to damage it to sell it back and try to tank the market. That is how Ver and Wu were temporarily causing some mischief. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:54:44
I look at the markets everyday. I will jump ship if that were to happen. But since bitcoin is the first and also one of the best I think through name recognition they are here to stay. ie Ford motor company for instance 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:01:33
I'll try to find it. It was a twitter post I think from one of the developers working on it. I saw it on here a few days ago.

Buy now. Even if the price dips which may or may not happen ( we never really know) I believe for a long term investment the price of bitcoin will keep going up. The sooner you can get a piece, the better off you will be for a long term investment. I'd also setup a weekly buy order of whatever you're comfortable with. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:11:45
I agree. I think a lot of people see that if they are able to walk through all of the smoke and mirrors. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:41:52
was that you who bumped bitcoin from 6,200 to 6,400? ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:07:18
Yeah ok. Still though, I really wish Bitcoin Cash would call themselves something that isn't so misleading. Ver coin sounds kinda cool, don't ya think? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:38:45
yep. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:38:47
That's a growth of over 10 times it's current market cap. I can see this happening today as awareness of crypto and bitcoin continues to grow. In that sense, I can see bonds as quite a safe place to store/invest in. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:47:32
the consequences is that if they sold their bitcoin to buy more BCH they are shit out of luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:27:45
that's a bigger gamble imo. cuz what if it doesn't go back down? what i'm talking about buying now is called dollar averaging it's the best way to keep out of volatility in the market
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:25:31
wow, that was a great article.

Thanks! The key is to live very modestly. I have everything I need because I live a minimal lifestyle and live within my needs. So a lot of my income goes towards saving anyways.

It's really fun too! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:28:34
Yes. And if lightning doesn't come out soon then I can see people using Ether or Litecoin more often but I already felt like that is what is happening. I use bitcoin to store wealth and for large transactions. For paying for tacos I'll probably try to use litecoin

"Rumors spread in the past day – based on a circulated document – indicating that the country's State Grid was moving to ban bitcoin mining at a county level in Sichuan province, an ostensibly notable development given the area's abundant water supply for electricity generation and the fact that profit-chasing bitcoin miners are headquartered in the region."
A ton of hash power comes from China and China is making a huge push for renewables. 360 billion dollars worth actually as renewables become more profitable and lower cost than fossil fuel.

Idk, there are pretty easy to use sites like Coinbase right now that make it somewhat easy to navigate. If people want to tug their new beards from dipping into bitcoin they can expand from there. As the years go on, it is gonna be more common knowledge. But you're right though, maybe a new coin could eventually take over but I think crypto currency and the block chain is confusing for many people *regardless* of the coin to use.

it depends on your server setup. But give nicehash a try and see what happens. They should have a profitability calculator where you can estimate the hash power you have in combo with the amount of wattage you are using and how much you are paying electricity for. It is worth a shot! But nicehash works pretty well for me. I use my graphics card to mine with though.

if you do cash out though, then you have to pay a gains tax. if you continue to spend bitcoin at stores around the country that accepts it, these businesses are paying their sales tax and you are stimulating the economy. i work in local government. no one is worried on crypto. shoot, it might be nice to use crypto in the future for low fees on funding projects etc.

that's ok no worries then. things will settle down soon. with this SX2 stuff and the market in korea things are going crazy and really testing the network but it is going to stay solid. bitcoin transactions will catch back up.

not that much really. you might have your coinbase account which is attached to you but as soon as your bitcoin to say a bitcoin core wallet and send it to another wallet the transactions get pretty anonymous. Even more concerned about anonymity? buy bitcoin in person from localbitcoins or something where the transaction to an offline wallet is completely private and anonymous. But for my purposes for bitcoin i want to buy everything with it as a legitimate currency.

I'm happy I am a part of this too. We are such early adopters. The market cap for Apple is over 800 billion. The market cap for bitcoin is just under 200 billion. There is over 200trillion i hear floating around in the stock market. If even a small portion of say like 5% of that went into bitcoin it would sky rocket. And with a bonus as a currency with real world uses? This is really revolutionary stuff. I plan to go on a vacation later in 2018 with expedia as a small reward to myself but i will pay in bitcoin. 
i think society right now is so focused and being trained as a consumerist society. i think with a deflationary currency like bitcoin we will see a whole new generation of savers and better spenders.

@_date: 2017-11-29 04:51:50
It's a deflationary currency so the value grows with more vested interest. Buying a laptop might have cost 20 bitcoin 5 years ago but now a laptop can be bought for like .1 bitcoin. Even though the value of bitcoin grows it can be spent very much in the same way. With more adoption comes more stabilization of prices. I don't see bitcoin going anywhere but up. I don't plan to ever sell, but continue to use my bitcoins as a currency. I plan to go on a nice vacation in 2018 with bitcoin using expedia.

they got it that high from their last attack. bitcoin bounced back and is stronger than ever. that said, there are some concerns but i think they are short lived and bcash should just accept themselves as an alt coin and stop with the attacks. what's good for one crypto is good for every other one.

By design the blockchain transaction is supposed to take 10 minutes as a security measure. I guess you don't buy much with it but I don't have problems with it. Also have you heard of lightning? That can be huge for crypto currency when it drops. 96% test rate on github if you want to read up on it. That said there are other cryptos that compliment bitcoin. I think bitcoin isn't going anywhere as its store of value is stellar and it has name recognition. I read up on crypto everyday. I'm not misinformed.

they have actually gone down. it was at 170k a few days ago. earlier today the queue was at 90k. 70k is progress as the miners work their way through the pool. if you didn't catch there was a giant orchestrated attack against bitcoin and they tried to kill it so they could get people to use a new coin instead. didn't work out for them but now the pool is playing catch up
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:53:02
there is still a fee for handling cash. big businesses get armored trucks to pick up their cash for example. that comes with a fee. also there is the risk of counterfeits and other things. bitcoin is resolute. i think over time paper cash will become obsolete as digital currency and debit/credit cards trump paper. i mean we are talking about 2060. also, i think the 10% fee for bitcoin is absurdly high. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:27:22
exactly. I want to be part of the change. Nothing wrong with trying to be an early adopter. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:41:38
usually ~15 minutes or less last time I took a payment. If you read my post you would see that I stated that I believe the wait is coming from an artificial spam attack. A few days ago the transaction queue was 170k. Right now it is at 70k. It is already getting better. You have a nice day now. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:15:13

I am giving you the perspective of the other side of bitcoin with merchants. Also just relax. Bitcoin was attacked by spam transactions trying to take up the mempool and delay transactions. A few days ago the transaction queue was 170k and now it is 70k. It's gonna get better. 
also, a lot of businesses offer a 5 to 15 percent discount for using bitcoin. so you don't end up paying more to use it. usually less than normal because you are also saving the merchant money. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:48:57
there are hardware wallets that are really easy to use and safe. i'm sure a nice grandson could help her get set up. but yes, bitcoin is not for *everyone* just yet but if there are services set up i think we will be fine. i mean, our local senior resource center helps people balance their checkbooks and pay their taxes for free. i can see someday a service for bitcoin

I mean, I have a savings account and a yearly maxed out Roth IRA. I could use either one of them for a down payment but I'm betting on crypto.

I think bitcoin will remain the savings account for crypto while alt coins like LTC and Eth will be everyday purchasers. Remember though, all you need is an initial transaction for some small time merchants to be good on deals. Such as affording a few dollar risk for tacos. Look at how long it takes for a debt card transaction to clear from your checking account. It takes days for my account balance to finally be deducted

I don't worry about too much of the price surging ahead since I usually just buy more bitcoin once I've spent some. 50 dollar spendature? I'm buying 75. etc etc
you do make valid points but i think over the next few years once square payments and other vendors start to widely adopt bitcoin as a payment people will look to spend instead of sell their bitcoin.

I've had 500 dollar bottles of champagne before. After a certain point youre just buying because it is expensive. Look at chinese business men for instance buying tons of overpriced stupid shit.

I think the term is called packet sniffing. On a public connection you can sniff traffic that is happening across the network. This can happen to people punching in their credit card and shopping etc as well. You have to have some sort of talent to pull this off.

Japan uses the shit out of bitcoin for currency. It makes up like 60% of all bitcoin transactions. You can also shop on Newegg, Overstock and Expedia for starters. I am looking at buying a vacation with bitcoin this summer. We need more mass adoption of businesses accepting bitcoin and to stop talking about bitcoin being like a stock because it's not. If we keep using it more people will learn to appreciate and respect it and the value will continue to grow.

I think that's a load of BS. People want to see the price go down so they can buy more. There is a lot of big money and investors coming into the bitcoin space. I think it would be foolish to sell right now without seeing how 10's of billions of dollars in new money will effect the price of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:37:39
There is usually a base rate built in. But yeah, if you're paying over 20 cents a kwh hour you will lose money mining. better to just buy more crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:36:53
wow, just stop. you stay in your subreddit. i don't go to yours and shill. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:09:13
I bought an extra monitor for my PC just to keep  so I don't have to constantly alt tab out of my games to see what the price is doing. It is an addiction -- but it has been making me money-- and slowly killing me from stress lol. HOLD! 
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:24:18
My friend who told me to buy and use bitcoin is in her late 60's. I'm 27. I think people of all ages can and do spend bitcoin.

here is the copy of the coinbase testimony if anyone wants to read
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:50:29
it's never too late. go for it. i think it's gonna keep going up
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:03:54
i still think crypto will be the future. though greed has always been a part of civilization. and for the record, these people suck.

I'd rather not share online since it has my name involved. But here is a picture of a coffee table I built  
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:27:36
what the hell am i watching? what movie is this from? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:18:52
I will continue to tell everyone I know and ask every business to support bitcoin, ether and ltc. Coinbase says they get 30k new users everyday. This is still gonna keep taking off and eventually with a larger network and user base shit like this won't be able to happen as much. Cronyism at its finest right now. They should all be ashamed. 
Just got to keep strong and tell everyone not to panic sell. That is what they want. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:55:55
can you explain this a bit? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:44:48
Bummer. Sorry to hear that. I hear Gemini has a good exchange place. Perhaps check them out? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:01:31
there are tons of reason to use bitcoin as a real currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:15:26
Sorry I thought it was January already lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:08:13
My GF buys bitcoin just as much as I do. She's pretty hot too. Don't think that women in bitcoin is a barrier because it is not. Tell them about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:09:42
Are they really called "Wealthy Man Group Fund?" I can't read the article on my protected network
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:44:39
Heck yeah! I'm way too busy to do online and that is a headache in itself. I'd much rather focus locally and carve my way (pun intended) 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:05:06
Look at the prices already. But yes this is my guess it will go up higher 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:16:33
yeah but new hands are exchanging and entering the game including a lot of investment money. i think we are losing the weak hands but the rest of us better hodl on once we shoot past this sell wall. i think we will break by today or tomorrow and 11 and 12k by thursday and friday. all guess of course. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:59:10
I bought at 5400 earlier today if that's what youre asking. I don't think it will dip that low again but who knows! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:05:39
Coinbase is good. Maybe in Germany try Gemini or Gdax if you can. Coinbase is the easiest though. Good luck! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:30:14
possible money laundering is my guess. if you aren't doing anything illicit you have nothing to worry about. that said, move your bitcoin off the exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:13:09
And I thought the first one was pretty bad. But I like watching bad movies as a hobby. Still can't watch Michael Bay though
is a great place to find treasure troves. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:45:59
what if you're wrong though? i'd rather just hodl and not take the risk. i'd just buy more on the dip and keep the rest. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:12:53
Hold on for a bumpy ride. Dont panic sell. I'm all in. At least this is how I feel. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:39:57
is it fair trade though
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:23:37
I agree. I think we need to make mining more accessible for all so shit like this doesnt keep happening. Also, give it a few more years for more acceptance and user base. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:26:37
FML probably
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:44:34
if it dips, i buy the dip. it will go back up
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:49:05
I just looked at right now. I don't even know what to say. This isn't healthy. I feel like there are a handful of people talking to each other with multiple accounts to keep the hype train chooching. 
I think the mod here should try to sticky something to calm some worried people down. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:09:27
This is why I don't use the mobile phone app. Sorry. Thanks for letting us know
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:45:52

Sometimes I feel like I'm drinking the kool-aid. But not in this instance. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:09:44
I am looking for a 20 to 50k downpayment on a home. I will keep the rest in bitcoin as I suspect that I will get more than a 4% roi every year compared to real estate which is what I can get a mortgage for. No need to buy outright just yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:50:39
i think the market is gonna bottom out here, hence the drop in housing prices. a lot of growers here who have literal barrels of cash buried. when the price of the pound drops though, it's not gonna be so elusive to live and grow up here
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:28:45
Seriously. Credit cards can charge up to 3% per transaction. A lot of businesses in my town are cash only because they hate the credit card companies. Even at 5$ a transaction that is no big deal to me and I think the prices will become cheaper as the market smooths out some more. There is so much BS hype going around. I feel like this is all propaganda. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:36:55
It's definitely an interesting thought to consider. Do you ever go to always great discussions and content on there about stuff like this. The debates on basic income are always fun to be a part of. But I think eventually that is where the world might go. I mean there is always a demand for products and say 200 years ago manufacturers built things to last. But due to things like planned obsolescence which companies like Apple are famous for exploiting people have lost or never knew the values of buying and cherishing premium goods. I have a pair of work boots that are on their third pair of soles. I am a woodworker and use tools that are over a hundred  years old because they were quality to begin with. It is possible to bring this back. The manufacturers will make what the market is asking for. Right now it is the cheapest things possible. But perhaps one day it will be the best value (ie quality/life)
As the saying goes, "buy once, cry once"
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:55:16
You can still play fantasy football but for free instead! I think the opportunity to make more money is way greater with bitcoin. Good luck !
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:33:47
so why the volatility in the market? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:55:43
This is fucking glorious. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:20:33
Yes it will be more less. I think you transfer to a usd wallet on Coinbase and then you can transfer it to GDAX. At that point you can also get your coins immediately when you buy some
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:41:00
oh shoot i glossed over that part that you currently mined. well in that case, do yo thang! but i still think it will be the most profitable to pay off the mortgage while you focus on your gains. but that's just me living dangerously
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:09:54
Hahaha. Fair dinkum callout. Some people would rather be wrong than right it appears 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:02:41
My thoughts exactly. I bought the last dip at 5400. I think we might hit 7k or 6800 at lowest. Definitely gonna buy more. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:39:08
Wow, you must be *so* much fun to have around. I wonder what the predecessors of your generation were saying about you? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:49:59
Accurate 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:58:06
no prob. i think mining is a fun hobby to get behind that can also generate a small revenue stream
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:14:23
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:14:00
yeah, but tether has nothing to do with bitcoin in many ways. i wish an objective reporter understood this. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:40:12
bitcoin decided to have a sale today
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:03:05
i would only take out what you need to get a good mortgage. say you only take out 50k for a 250k house and get a mortgage for 200k over 30yrs.
why would you do that instead of cash out all together? cuz you can probably get a mortgage for 3 or 4% interest. Meanwhile the leftover savings in bitcoin might explode another 1000 percent, but definitely at least more than the 3 or 4% mortgage. I'm telling you, you'll make way more money doing it this way! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:04:56
They can better control the price of bitcoin though with their purchasing power. And with that miners will stay as it is more profitable. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:34:09
if you're looking to get in long term, don't wait for dips. put in what you can afford to lose each payday. it's called dollar averaging and is a great strategy for long term investments. cheers
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:26:55
oh i guess i have a gtx 1070. damn it is getting confusing after a while. i have the 8gb one.
i would look at mining ethereum as they are set up for video card mining. i might put better thermal paste on your gpu or get a waterblock since they will be running hot 24/7 but it is no big deal. if electricity is free then go nuts
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:45:24
don't forget girls too. my gf has a lot in bitcoin and ether and one of my best friends who is a chick owns a few bitcoins.  edit: why the downvotes? I'm just saying that there are females among us who use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:35:54
I guess I was trying to say if you want to hobby mine as a pc gamer it is somewhat fun but yes, it is definitely better to just buy more bitcoin instead of investing in hardware that won't make much of a profit. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:57:25
your post history shows your obvious trolling
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:35:04
he's still muttering about bitcoin cash on his twitter at least 17 hours ago. i wonder if he has seen the prices yet. which are 7,190USD at 0436 pst 11/15/2017
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:46:39
it's deflationary that is why 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:22:02
I guess either of us are right depending on the amount of risk we want to take. Either way I'm not too nervous right now
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:54:40
Instead Mr. Deutsche bank would like you to spend your money at his bank instead!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:39:46
you won't profit anything fyi since you'll be operating at a loss! much better to mine ether for a pc i reckon. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:19:34
China has banned crypto. Look at the south Korean currency. China is buying their bitcoin with that 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:37:58
This is my opinion but these are my thoughts too. There is a lot of collusion going on and I think just a few people are gonna walk away from this making a tidy profit. I think sticking with old faithful is better than the one night stand. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:08:48
This. But if you tell them about it they will likely adopt. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:15:21
nah the queue is going down it was at 170k a few days ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:53:37
I'm going to hold for at least 3 more years and then I'm gonna see if I have enough to at least get a down payment for a house. In the meantime, I will continue to put as much as I can afford to lose into Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:05:33
I doubt many miners will at this point. They need 50% or more right? Its super profitable to mine bit coin right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:12:42
I think Bitcoin will max out at around 500k in probably 15 years. I think Ethereum will become the traditional use for everyday purchases while Bitcoin will become asset storage and for larger transactions.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:49:11
An even better reason to switch to credit unions that are member owned and not corporate owned. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:08:22
Hahaha! Slick one. 
I am feeling a lot better though. Even though we aren't at where we were a few days ago, btc and the community is showing its resilience. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:50:12
I think they can only do this so many times and get away with it. And each time these big names do stuff like this they lose respect and leverage with the community. I think roger ver is done for and so is jihan wu at the end of this. Might not matter to them as they will cash out big.
We need more personal miners and not cartels running calculations so there is better consistent power. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:33:41
CME, now Nasdaq? I can't help but think if we are patient the price will go up. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:37:04
better to buy bitcoin directly from places like coinbase instead of mining. mining needs big $$ and low electricity costs to be powerful
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:55:05
I bought at 5400 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:37:31
I mean, it makes sense for a financial institution to say something like that. If more people store their money in crypto  then they lose business. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:26:00
i think the slight mystery would make things fun if you already know his wallet address. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:22:16
Thanks for sharing. I still think hash will swing back to btc. BCH is facing a 400percent difficulty increase and btc is becoming profitable to mine due to backup queue. There is a mining cartel jihan wu trying to mess with the market in this way in my opinion. The others will flock back after the dump and difficulty increase
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:05:08
I dont think it will. Regardless though call your Congress and tell them no. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:21:02
it's not. you're not thinking large enough. this is a deflationary currency. it changes everything. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:48:35
mastering bitcoin is a great starter.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:02:54

Even a complete outsider would know this is a troll. I feel sorry for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:50:53
to be fair, your us dollar gets heavily tracked if you're using a bank account. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:48:57
I think everyone wants to jump onto the rollercoaster that is Bitcoin right now. I'm not selling my Ethereum right now but I also won't be buying anymore currently and instead keep putting more into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:41:21
There is a site floating around showing all the businesses that accept it. I have bought plane tickets, tacos, sushi, electronics, groceries and so much more with bitcoin.,keep asking businesses if they will accept it or not. You can totally spend all your bitcoin easily with the businesses that currently accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:00:03
Who else is buying some of this dip? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:51:48
what do you mean by this?
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:16:23
this. I have backups in email, encrypted drive, and on paper. it would take a lot for me to lose access
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:15
you have to remember that this is deflationary currency and therefore does not act like ANY typical stock. Also, bitcoin is literally money. As long as there is an economy for it which is growing then the demand will continue to be there as people can buy and sell with it. i can book a trip around the world right now if i wanted to with bitcoin on expedia. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:32:37
i hope so!

@_date: 2017-11-29 05:27:18
i don't think it's gonna dip much. we will see. i only see it going up for the next few days
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:09:50
i'll keep buying into it for the next 20 years too. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:48:14
If it dips, buy the dip. I am up a ton since I bought in at the dip when it hit 5,500 last week. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:50:11
A lot of people setup automatic transactions to go through on exchanges. So say someone wants to sell their bitcoin when it hits 10k they can do that automatically in the exchange. Same with buying if bitcoin ever hits a price point that the buyer wants to buy at. Right now there is a big sell wall for 10k. Probably a lot of psychological reasons behind it as this is literally record setting and we are sort of watching history. Some people wanna sell at this milestone. I personally think it's foolish as it will keep going up over time
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:56:24
i love it
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:16:57
I don't believe this. Also for any others reading. HOLD. I bought MORE for 5,400. You won't lose any money if you aren't selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:04:20
Another reason to go into lightning.  we are getting close to completion. 
I don't think attacks can be sustained for long either way. Especially with new releases on tech. I feel like our mempool was attacked already by the BCH pump and dump yet we survived. I think with lightning this will become even more difficult to achieve a similar effect. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:08:17
Who says this?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:01:33
gemini is a good exchange to start with for the UK and i would recommend downloading the bitcoin.org core wallet (takes a long time to update) to store your bitcoins. Goodluck and only spend what you can afford to lose. I personally think its gonna keep going uP! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:33:02
ledger nano s. i honestly just carry my cell phone around with me. you can also get a bitpay card that works just like a visa debit if you are looking for something like that
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:28:29
I think a lot more people are looking to buy into bitcoin. And with lightening integration payments and use of currency will become even easier. There will be some ups and downs but I don't even think we will be close to a correction
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:33:59
this is amazing. thank you for your detailed comment. i'm totally going to look into this more i appreciate the input
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:38:50
Well if you can purchase physical items with it I consider that a currency regardless whether the currency itself is physical or digital.

yeah, but bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:20:03
i don't think it will get that low as many people will want to buy in at that price. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:46:10
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:52:29
Yeah, no. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:34:14
i'm looking to at least double what i have put in and i am already close to doing that. my real end game though is to never cash out and use a more widely adopted currency as the years go by. i bought bitcoin to use it and i'm rewarded for being an early adopter
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:34:17
Start digging to China.

@_date: 2017-11-15 13:46:58
we are talking about a temporary fluctuation in price and time on transactions that i believe are artificially created and have only been this bad over the past 2 or 3 days. it wasn't like this a week ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:44:17
I still think you came out on top! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:59:49
I work until 0630 PST. I'll let you know. If it dips I will buy more. But right now I suspect that bitcoin will continue to rise. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:16:52
Very interesting indeed
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:23:00
A ledger wallet is just something that's portable and convenient. I might be wrong but I consider a hardware wallet that uses physical properties to store your data instead of a software wallet. So, a physical hard drive for instance can be used as a wallet. A Ledger or Trezor is just convenient for carrying around with you for transactions. Cheers
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:21:29
Someome woke up and decided to sell lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:58:24
so like any stock
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:43:29
i think they do care about it. bitcoin made them very rich as it is. then it got to their heads.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:05:05
What about all the rewards from high transaction costs? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:26:39
a pending transaction is good. should take about 7 days with coinbase to receive funds. not sure why there were cancellations otherwise. do you buy with credit card or your bank account?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:30:05
I m not gonna say! But enough and I'm gonna keep buying. :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:07:38
Opposite end up in Humboldt! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:57:04
it was 150k two weeks ago and transactions were still getting through. relax :) 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:24:40
Better buy up then. But seriously, I don't think it will go that low. Bitcoin is used as a legit currency right now. Newegg.com for instance, a huge retailer accepts it. I would not be surprised if Amazon picks up bitcoin for purchases soon too. It's gonna keep gaining steam. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:37:04
i think we are still early adopters. make sure to ask every small business you go to to see if they accept bitcoin. more and more people are adopting. this is good
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:04:16
to your checking account? yes, and just in case you have other transactions coming through into your checking. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:26:08
I usually buy more the day of a transaction. Also, you usually get 5 to 15% off from merchants so there is an incentive to buy with it. Your attitude is to be desired. Bitcoin is an awesome currency and it will keep getting better as adoption continues to grow. If you want bitcoin to be more widely adopted you have to start spending with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:08:56
You're not losing anything if you don't sell. Hang on and wait for it to bounce back 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:33:43
Yep very true. Just hang in there and buy low.

The economy wouldn't be lost though. People still need to buy and sell things. Sales tax will still occur. People paying capital gains tax. The economy won't be lost what so ever. Banks on the other hand might lose some of their sweet profits from investing the money you keep in your savings account. I moved a lot of my savings into bitcoin (still very well prepared for a rainy day) because I think the 0.5% interest on savings is literally losing you money by keeping it there and I might as well take a calculated risk.
The USA is gonna love my capital gains tax, I guarantee it.

True, but I just didn't want to start any confusion with newcomers on here. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:29:27
Exactly. Antminer or jihan wu moved 20 percent of hash power I hear. He might stay to push his interests, but the other miners in it for business will probably move back to bitcoin for more profit. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:45:17
Wouldnt nodes be more important at that measure?
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:29:15
they are looking at a technology called lightning. check it out! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:22:17
this one was super helpful for me
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:45:17
I bought when it was low! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:53:31
Probably bottom the market to worthless or damn near kill it 
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:39:22
For now it does, as 7nm tech comes out for mining things will just continue to become more efficient and efficient.

Just keep waiting. There is a lot of movement of Bitcoin right now from all the shit going down in Korea right now. I'm almost thinking of switching from mining Ethereum to mining Bitcoin for a bit to help catch up the network.

i just worked a 13 hour nightshift. can you elaborate for my tired brain? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:02:54
I really couldn't tell ya. But I did buy when it hit that low. I think it will keep going back up personally. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:53:47
It is a gamble. But like I said only spend what you can afford to lose. I personally think it will continue to climb. But I haven't spent all of my savings on it just yet. Just in case something were to happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:43:10
Cryptowat.ch saw the drop of almost a thousand in a few minutes. It could well be back up. I am on the shitter and dont have my pc near me right now. Shit is volatile
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:12:45
I buy the british way. I buy all the drinks I think I'm going to drink first. I would start my transaction and drink my drinks. Right now the transaction queue is going down and is finally below 100k. Normally transactions take me about 10 minutes. That is plenty of time to finish my drinks before I really have to pay. I have a small business and I accept bitcoin. The technology like lightning is just gonna make it even greater but right now the currency can work and does work. Don't follow the FUD

@_date: 2017-11-15 10:42:37
for a desktop pc yes, but we don't know the kind of hardware they got and scaling. 16 core server CPU's could really do some damage potentially. He should run the nicehash benchmark and then use their profitability calculator and see if they come out on top. Also, some server farms do use GPU's depending on the kind of work they are applying their machines to. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:16:05
 if you're in it for the long term, better to buy now then wait or it could be a gamble trying to see if it will come down.
i like coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:42:50
get guiminer and make an account with slush pool. it wont be profitable but you can help for a bit. i made a thread on it if you wanna read what i did in the comments section if you're unclear on how to set it up. cheers for helping
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:59:22
yeah, i don't use credit enough to justify the subscription costs, so i pay a percentage fee instead which is 2.75% to 3.5% depending on a swipe or manual entry. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:02:24
This will get harder to accomplish as more people start using bitcoin and more people start mining. Coinbase says they are getting 30,000 new accounts everyday. Exponential growth. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:07:29
I've never visited bitcoin.com before. What do I win?
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:49:24
More than 50% of the miners have to be willing to fork though so that keeps stuff like this from happening every time
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:07:33
Good for europe since they can buy when it is low. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:20:57
Could be possible. Better buy more

Hoping we reach an all time high today. I have 6 more hours to watch the market at work. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:31:22
I bought more at 5400. Hodl! ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:50:05
yes, please spend it. and when you spend it make sure you buy more of it to replace your spendings. i plan to book a vacation this summer using bitcoin on expedia. but i have bought electronics, shoes, even tacos using bitcoin before. it's a super convenient currency once you're up and running. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:41:01
no prob! it really is up to the business owner to how much they believe in bitcoin too. taking a payment of 20usd for a pizza 2 years ago could have been worth 7k dollars to them today. with the amount of people buying stuff with bitcoin i would be more than happy to store some transactions in bitcoin and not necessarily cash them out and invest that way. you'd be surprised in what you can buy with bitcoin though. you just have to ask around shops and see. i always do that at any small business i go into cuz you never know if you plant a seed or not and they start reading in to it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:48:23
3 of my friends bought more yesterday. It is never too late to buy more. I think we are gonna keep climbing in price as more people adopt bitcoin as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:50:37
Yes. You have to. Volatility is the name of the game. But i hope you only put in what you could afford to lose worst case scenario. I don't think we will get there though 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:12:16
If it dips again, I'm buying again. Looks like the miners are on our side though and won't be chasing another coin (for now) 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:46:31
I mean there is always room for improvement but the whole hyped this currency is dead fallacy is really grinding my gears. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:48:22
i think right now at 6400 is a decent time to buy
save half of what you plan to put in in case it gets lower. if not keep buying btc over time. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:08:21
I hear lightning implementation is coming out first half of 2018. That should help immensely. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:41:18

@_date: 2017-11-17 07:45:22
And buy more! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:02:57
At this point it would take a mountain to be moved to dethrone bitcoin, especially with all of the press and companies looking to back it.
I think bitcoin or custom made block chain technology will become standard in banking institutions in no time. My one concern is that banks may make personal block chains themselves to deal with their own internal transactions in a centralized marketplace. That said, there is a ton of appeal to decentralized currency and I believe that the value of bitcoin specifically will continue to rise. 
Also, technologies like Lightning  almost nearing completion I suspect Bitcoin will continue to remain on top. There are a lot of powerful factors behind this in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:41:41
Hundreds of millions but I got a B+ in Statistics like 5 years ago.

@_date: 2017-11-30 05:57:03
They have to buy in order to short. I don't think that will happen as they will see their profits grow at least 20% per month which is much better than a futures short imo. But again this isn't a stock, it's a currency so there is more value to it than say an apple stock. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:50:35


THIS THIS THIS. Calm down everyone. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:12:19
For gods sake everyone move away from banks and support your local credit unions. You get such better deals. And with the savings you get there you can buy more bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:30:56
Haha I can imagine. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:24:51
There is room, but not for Bitcoin Cash because they are trying to say it is bitcoin. Litecoin and Ethereum for instance make distinct differences. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:21:39
it could, or it couldn't. i'm not so quick to say that bitcoin is dead like is.

Can you give a TLDR of the article since I have no clue what that is saying? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:54:55
this exactly. there is a current shitstorm of buying/selling due to sx2 drama. this will calm down in a few days and as more miners get online again i think things will continue to get better again
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:09:54
so I'm 26. I have a maxed out Roth IRA (5,500 a year) which should set me up nicely when I retire when I'm 65. But I'm also putting a bunch of discretionary income into Bitcoin every payday on the thought that this will be my secondary investment. It's high risk but I am betting it will pay off and by the time I would want to cash out I would have no need as Bitcoin is a much more adopted currency. I think I would have an extra special retirement or be able to work part time when I'm older and only pay for things I need in bitcoin to get by. But if bitcoin fails in a year or two which I think is highly unlikely, I do have my Roth as my typical retirement account so I won't be hurt too bad. I think it's gonna keep going up. As long as Bitcoin is making more than 20% a year, I am very happy with my investment and hope I get to keep buying more things with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:32:14
Japan. But the USA just wants your capital gains taxes. Unless banks start paying off politicians to ban crypto I don't think that's gonna happen. The USA always just wants a piece of the pie.

Noo! That's the worst feeling. I think the Gemini exchange is super fast with cash transfers? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:54:52
i usually mine ether but i wanted to help catch up bitcoin on the transaction queue no matter how small my effort is
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:50:42
It's ok. I make about 30 bucks a month after paying for power. I'm just holding on to Ether coins in the prospects that their value might increase. My largest stake is in bitcoin though but it is a money loss to mine with a typical PC setup
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:41:52
I hope one day that when I travel to other countries I won't have to worry about exchanges and I can just pay for everything using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:19:51
Just remember, bcash doesn't have CME futures, Coinbase setting up investor accounts for an estimated 10 billion on the sidelines, South Korean banks making vaults for customers, etc. You can't buy anything with Bcash meanwhile if you want to spend with crypto bitcoin is king as is most widely accepted. Good on you for holding bcash and if it rises again to say 2800 like it did for mere seconds I would sell it then. I don't think it is going to ever be close to what bitcoin is. Especially since it is centralized and has a CEO. That is basically almost going back to normal banking in my books. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:58:48

@_date: 2017-11-11 07:55:54
Yes I bought some around that amount too. I am not concerned in the long term. Just keep holding out and don't make a panic sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:44:42
Why do people need to transact now all of a sudden? I think of bitcoin as my savings account and use smaller crypto for transactions that are replenished by btc. I think it works fine as it does now. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:50:19
Right? I totally forgot about my fantasy surfing league. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:45:14
I think a really easy way to get into bitcoin is to use something like Coinbase exchange which also has a wallet built in. Once you get into it more (the sticky in green on here might help) then you might consider transfering to a different wallet then.
If you really just want to get your toes wet, Coinbase or Gemini can be helpful.
Cheers and welcome to the Bitcoin world! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:35:54
So, even though these guys are kind of breaking the system for profit, us current bitcoin holders are gonna make it out in the end OK anyways? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:16:21
Why not buy when it is low?
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:14:15
I think bitcoin is gonna keep going up. There is a ton of speculation and guessing as to where it will be but I think the price will keep rising. I would only invest with what I can afford to lose. Coinbase is a great exchange for starters. Goodluck with whatever decision you make!
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:12:30
Very well spoken dude

@_date: 2017-11-15 09:52:46
thanks! but yes I feel like I charge a fair price that pays decent enough and to what the local economy can afford. I am happy to just be able to work as little or as much as I want. 
And lol about the shoe rack thing. I totally agree. I should have just made a built in closet for shoes. I think I have 4 pairs of shoes total. I wear them to death and then get a new pair. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:35:43
yeah, i still stand by my statement that pretty much *all* or a large *majority* of electronics are made in China. The highest quality electronics seem to come from Taiwan and Japan but speaking in generalities China really does corner the world market for electronics for largest producers. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:53:53
To be fair I also use Ether and Litecoin. I think with the 3 there is a nice synergy of advantages and they all have their place. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:52:41
a lot of people will also either hold or new money will come in to replace those who sell. i personally think it's stupid to sell at 10k. i'd rather sell when it hit 40k if at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:53:22
I just need to stop looking at the market every 30 seconds. Maybe I can make it. I'm gonna keep buying as much as I can afford to lose over the next few years though. How do you think the market can get manipulated if investors have to buy coins initially? dump them all at once at a later time?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:11:20
Just wait. Months if you have to. I think it is gonna go back up. Zoom out to a larger trend of the prices. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:04:34

I want to believe. What's your rationale on that? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:39:49
there are so many ways to protect your money in crypto i'm not even gonna list them lol. but for everyday purchases you can keep a small amount of bitcoin in your wallet and have your other coins stored offline.

i forget the other company but i would not want to use bitmain or antminer even though they do make the best ones just on the pretense that jihan wu is the person who owns bitmain and does seedy things such as the last BCH scheme. 
you basically need an ASIC cpu though to mine bitcoin effectively. there are other coins you can mine with a GPU though and you can use a program like nicehash to mine with.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:38:12
I don't just hodl. I spend with it. It's a currency and I use it as it was intended. Not to say I don't replenish what I spend. Cheers.

offer your customers a 5% discount for using bitcoin. that way they don't get mad about the transaction fee and you both walk away saving money. conversely, litecoin and ether work too. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:01:35
I sort of lean towards a Democratic Socialist in some regards. But honestly that 10% rate is what is better for the people. I always try to think of my decision making as who will be affected most by it, and is it for the best? If many people will benefit from it and only a few will "suffer" (banks) then it is possible that we want the best for the people etc

" but my and large, mining concentrates in areas of low energy cost, and that generally equates with fossil-fuel burning."
You couldn't be any further from the truth. In China where some of the biggest mining organizations are they run their power from Large Hydro and not fossil fuels. 
It seems like you took a long time to write this up but if you researched a bit better you wouldn't have had to waste your time or my time or any others times reading this in that energy consumption really isn't a big deal especially with the surge in renewable energy. In fact, during some parts of the day there is too much energy on the grid for renewables so you can pretty much get that power for free to use for things like mining bitcoin etc 100% renewable and carbon free.
I work for an energy authority. We buy power to sell to our customers. If you have more specific questions about energy sources I might be able to help.

depends on the government. my guess is that governments want at least a fair share at taxes from it. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:13:17
By design, Bitcoin takes a minimum of 10 minutes to solve a block in the chain. So if it takes up to 6 block solves to 100% confirm a transaction that is why it can take up to an hour. Things like transfers from one wallet to another can take this long. Purchasing things in real life don't always have to take that long as you can get a notice of a pending transaction and wait for maybe one solved block chain to trust the purchase. It is really up to the vendor and how legit they want things to be. Right now there is a backlog due to some shenanigans I made in another submitted post trying to explain what's going on and why transaction times and fees are higher right now.

yeah! i would recommend downloading bitcoin core from bitcoin.org and setting up a hardware wallet on there. make sure you backup your backup.dat on multiple hard drives/flash drives as if you lose your keys you can't access your wallet anymore. once you take the proper precautions you are pretty darn safe. 
bitcoin core will take a while to download the entire blockchain which is about 150gb but once you're set up it is a nice thing to have.

They will be able to get more work done with the same amount of power. So the 203kwh for each transaction that was mentioned would change.
Also, using more energy isn't necessarily a bad thing with emerging renewable technologies. I work for an energy authority and during certain times of the day buying energy is incredibly cheap or even free as there is too much energy on the grid from renewables such as wind and solar so there is a lot of incentives to use the energy on the grid. I'm trying to work with the state on focusing excess energy on the grid into desalinating water to restore watersheds, though that can be an expensive endeavor in itself. 
Also, we must consider what Lightning will do for the bitcoin network and how it will also lower the cost for transactions through scaling efficiency changes.

I hear you and validate your concerns. I know the core devs are a great team and want to release something that will be perfect. I hear they are at 90% completion and that might come in less than 6 months. At the rate of expansion I sure hope so. Regardless though. It is still a good system when it is working the right way. A few days ago before the pump and dump and network spam, a transaction took me less than 15 minutes and cost a negligible amount. It can be done. And I think in the future with development it will become even better. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:45:13
i think the leftover fiat could be protected by the government as they continue to take money out of circulation to protect from inflation. they do this with the US dollar as it is. and to counter your argument, look at what has happened to Zimbabwe and their currency. or the Deutsche mark after world war ii. it's gonna boil down to the response of the government and adaptation.

I'd say the transaction queue will get better by Monday. Other implements like lightning probably come January. I'm far from an expert though but I definitely think the transaction queues are artificial and not typical whatsoever. There was one user sending 1 cent transactions while paying 10 dollar fees thousands of times. It is artificial congestion to hype bcc for a pump and dump. In a few days this should be more blown over but that is just my opinion.

I don't think Bitcoin will drop again for a while. Maybe a dip but I don't think it will go down past 7k USD again.

I think in the next few years it will be easy to vacation to different countries and pay for everything in one currency (bitcoin)

what bitcoin debit card do you use? i was wanting to get one. but that's pretty smart! i always replenish my bitcoin with more than i put in if i use it. i feel it is like paying a credit card bill, but instead of paying interest if i'm late, i usually put in about 15% more than i took out at the time. =) 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:52:16
who sits through and looks at these? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:18:03
a few days ago the transaction fee was not that high. it is artificially high imo. it is usually much less then that. But i see the point you are trying to make. But another thing that businesses do is offer a discount for using bitcoin. I've seen even 15% off products for bitcoin. So you are getting a discount and usually your transaction is less than the discount so it can be an incentive for customers to get bitcoin to use. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:25:51

if you are wanting to hang on to your coins for a while buying even at an all time high is now big deal compared to the interest you will amass over time. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:11:39
I think once it breaks the 10k barrier that will become the new floor as a ton of new money will come in. Can easily see us hovering around 13k as a conservative estimate for December and 15k by January. I think small 'corrections' will happen around this time. But also remember that Bitcoin is a currency and not a stock so it behaves quite differently. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:48:00

I think the cost of transactions will go down once people stop selling like crazy out of fear or speculation. That is what is backing up the mining networks. Also, we are talking stored value here. I think owning Bitcoin and Ethereum is a good move. Ethereum for everyday purchases, Bitcoin for storing assets and larger purchases. I think the cost for transactions will go down soon.

fees go to the miners who help process the transactions. without miners we don't have an operational decentralized network.  fees will go down eventually as transaction queue gets cleared up. also, with lightning technology which is almost near completion  we will see smaller transaction fees over time.

he'd make a lot of money temporarily, the price would dip down, i would buy when it is low, and eventually the prices would fluctuate back up again.

I love how excited Jim Cramer is about this. I am glad he is so enthusiastic about crypto. We all should be. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:14:50
Everyone has their price to sell. 
Also, once all bitcoins are discovered then miners will operate solely from transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:35:12
well the world economony is estimated at 1.2 quadrillion dollars. even 10% of that into crypto would be huge. say you invested 1000 dollars you would have 1,200,000 million dollars if that much of the market moved to bitcoin. not gonna give a timeline to when that might happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:47:59
So those are sells? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:57:49
Well I bought when it hit 5400. This is fun but insane at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:43:59
if it dips again i'm buying more.

Yeah, my last transaction done yesterday took around 15 minutes and I paid less than 2 dollars. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:16:13
Right now the system is out of wack as miners are trying to gobble up BCH. They will come back to mine BTC again and the cost for transactions and transaction speeds will come down again. Usually though you order your food and pay first. While you wait the few minutes for your food the transaction already went through and you were good to go. I obviously haven't bought anything with bitcoin today but the times I have it has usually been pretty quick. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:07:24
thanks. i guess i won't be watching it since i haven't watched any other ones but the first one
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:14:15
Thanks for that. I am hopefully Coinbase will follow through if it does happen. I just know it's gonna be wild for a bit as things get figured out. I feel like the price will start to go back up eventually though
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:24:03
I think so too. And with multiple wallets one day when making a transaction it would be no different than deciding whether to pull out your debit card or credit card to make a transaction. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:12:31
Its 1am here. I bought at 5400. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:16:11

I mine Ether to keep my room warm at night. I make about 30 dollars a month after paying 10 dollars in electricity. Who knows, maybe one day that 30 dollars a month could have worked out to 1,200 dollars a month but I personally think unless you have tens of thousands to blow on a setup the best thing to do is just buy crypto and hold it in wallets. I just mine as a hobby not as a serious plan. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:09:06
i don't think they have to. but basically it is a well oiled machine but the problem is that it is a centralized alt coin and in the end that is what will keep people away from it. if i wanted centralized currency i will just continue to use fiat money.

Like where can you buy stuff with it? Bitpay is a debit card that you can load up and use bitcoin for everyday purchases. Inside the crypto realm it is up to businesses to accept or not. I have a small business and I accept bitcoin, ether and etc. I have bought tacos with bitcoin before. 
Newegg.com a huge retailer lets you pay with bitcoin. 
I think Amazon is gearing up for bitcoin soon too. 
There will be more growth for crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:52:48

Great advice for not even just crypto currency. But yes, so far I have made a decent profit from buying in at 5,400 in the lowest of the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:08:04
yeah no prob, help out too if you can afford to do so!

@_date: 2017-11-16 12:38:24
i see what you are saying but if they were to buy into bitcoin now with that kind of capital on the premise of selling it all later to destabilize bitcoin that would make us all rich in the meantime. we would just jump off the ship early if we all saw a huge sell order. not gonna happen. i suspect they will try to adopt it and regulate it for tax purposes. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:44:34

@_date: 2017-11-29 06:52:50
it takes up to a week for your bitcoin to arrive in your coinbase wallet. you are locked in at the price you bought at though. so say you bought at 10k but 7 days later bitcoin is 14k you are receiving bitcoin that you bought at 10k and you made a nice increase. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:26:41

@_date: 2017-11-30 10:11:52
a great counter argument to darknet and terrorist money is that bitcoin is transparent and anyone can see the transactions. but with current currencies and especially with paper money it is very hard to see how it's being spent.

the price will probably skyrocket imo but it could also take a nose dive. but they aren't actually buying bitcoin (unless in the background) and are just speculating

lol its 7076 right now 
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:32:14
Someone is always willing to sell if the price is right. But since things can be transacted at say .000008 bitcoin the nomination of 1 entire bitcoin doesn't mean too much in using it as a currency. That's the beauty of deflationary currency. You can buy a bitcoin from someone locally or you can buy some on an exchange where someone wants to sell their bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:33:29
i've bought freakin tacos with bitcoin. expedia, newegg and overstock all accept bitcoin. that's a great starter point. deck your house out with furniture and electronics and then take yourself on a vacation around the world. not a bad time to be alive when buying with crypto currency
if you don't know what to buy with bitcoin then you are either a troll or not looking hard enough. go visit japan if you really want to spend some bitcoin! tons of shops take it there.

I just saw this too. This is confusing to me. I dont think the fork will even happen?
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:38:37
And business owners raise the price to offset the credit/debit/cash services. Them paying 'zero' is an illusion hidden in the price tag. Some stores even give discounts if people pay in cash (or bitcoin) and if people get a discount for using bitcoin for instance and they have to pay the transaction fee then technically their expense is the same.  Just some thoughts. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:08:45
you just have to send it and leave a little personal message outside of the bitcoin network. i think that's the only way at this point. but that's a great gift regardless.

I rent but I'm totally fine with that since I live less than a mile from work and I think the housing market is going to go down as the USA eventually enters a bear economy and due to our local economies shifting since cannabis is legalized in CA and our black market growers struggle to sell pounds for the same price as they did a few years ago. (estimation that our marijuana industry is up to 50% of our local economy) so I see housing prices fall as demand lessens from inflated black economy. Great time to move in and buy then

yep, they are one in the same essentially 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:40:59
what about people who invest *and* buy with it? cuz i do both. and with mass adoption comes more places we can spend our coins and volatility reduces.

Assuming that if the worldwide economy is around 1.2 quadrillion dollars and assuming that over the next 10 years the world decides to put 10% of the worldwide GDP into crypto a thousand dollar investment today could be worth 1.2 million dollars 10 years from now. It's a hell of a long shot, but I'm holding on and I'm putting some of my retirement into crypto I'm that much of a believer. I think this is gonna be one of the next huge things for the internet. But I think Bitcoin and Ethereum will stay out on top, especially with Ethereums abilities outside of currency and its real life applications. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:50:03
transaction fees could be less, or even more convenient. a hardware wallet for bitcoin is a pretty interesting concept. i see the future of using bitcoin as no different than deciding whether or not you want to use a debit card or credit card for a purchase but the thing with bitcoin is that you can use it anywhere in any country at any time

The standard right now the Antminer S9 draws about 1,500 watts of power. The S9 if running on 10 cents a kwh you profit around 450 to 550 a month. That's running it 24/7. You're gonna need some energy storage options if you plan to run off of solar 24/7 otherwise the energy cost can get expensive when your solar is not running. Or, you can only mine crypto when your solar is running at best times of day

Just keep waiting. There has been a delay in transactions from the loads of buying and selling right now. Things will catch up eventually in my opinion. Also, personally I wouldn't pay someone to mine for me. I would rather buy and hold as I think you get a better ROI.

We have to look at other sides too though. There is potentially just as much money waiting on the sideline to buy the dips. I see this balancing out and not creating the effect they are thinking
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:51:16
look at the new crony of consumer affairs that Trump hired. They don't care about the government being in control. All that matters to them is the mighty dollar and bitcoin is taking away from their profits. I'm not saying that banks are paying people off as I was joking, but I honestly think this behavior is highly encouraged out of fear.

i think with more people buying into bitcoin the prices won't fluctuate so wildly but i do think we will see a steady increase over time that will benefit current holders and users of the coin. so buy now if you can before the price keeps jumping in my opinion. any new money source into bitcoin is good.

I don't think it's gonna go below 6,500 so I would buy now. You might make a few more bucks if it drops some below 6,500 but I think that with all investments come a risk but I think this one is gonna pay off as the value will start to climb back up. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:28:35
yes, there are forecasts that it will hit 40k by end of year. it's all a guess though and only invest what you can afford to lose of course but i think it's only keep going up

Where in Cali do you pay that much for power? I get 100% renewable energy (I pay extra for it) for .15 a kwh and late at night when I mine (10pm to 0600) it is around .05 cents a kwh due to not much usage on the grid. Also I can mine at around 1 to 4 pm for a pretty low fee when there is a large amount of power on the grid due to renewables (solar/wind)

I'd go for it personally. I have afforded what I can to lose this month but I think it is gonna reach past 7k and 7500 later this week. But don't take financial advice from anyone but yourself. And spend what you can afford to lose. But personally I would buy now. Hope that is helpful. Cheers and welcome! Also, I like coinbase as it is super noob friendly.

yeah i think bitfinex is privy to larger companies trading etc. but yeah if you can't use GDAX then I have heard pretty good things on Gemini. Hope you get in soon! I am kicking myself still for thinking way back in 2013 how complicated it was to make a bitcoin wallet and I gave up on the process. I am glad I'm in now but hold tight. I think with bigger markets coming companies like Square will make bitcoin transactions much easier
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:14:31
no. what happened was that bitcoin was attacked and spammed by transactions. whoever did it was transacting cents on the dollars but paying huge fees to do it. it affected everyone and they lost tons of money doing it. this was artificial. prior to that just a few days ago fees were no big deal.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:19:00
if it got to 20k and it dropped to 15k that would be huge, yet you still coulda bought now at 10200. you'd still be up. it's not gonna drop like you think it might. there is *so* much interest and new money wanting to be a part of bitcoin. we are still early adopters.

At first glance, sharks and dolphins may seem to be similar in size and shape, though sharks obviously appear to be stronger for obvious reasons already mentioned.  However, when taking a closer look there are many differences in the two that can be noted and give the dolphin quite an advantage.  Sharks are an ancient fish with skeletons of cartilage, where dolphins are descended from mammals that have returned to the sea and sport skeletons with hard, calcified bones.  The skeletons of sharks have joints that are not as flexible as the dolphins.
It is for this reason that dolphins sometimes have the upper hand and are much swifter than sharks.  They have also been known to maneuver very quickly and are very agile in the water.  The tail of a shark is also different from a dolphin.  A shark’s tail has a fins located on a vertical plane that move from side to side which limits its ability to quickly dive downward and /or rise upward.  A dolphin’s tail however has horizontally mounted flukes that move up and down and enable a dolphin to change direction with ease, allowing it to move upward or downward with no problem.
Since dolphins normally travel together in groups, if one of the group is threatened by a shark, the other dolphins will join in without hesitation to do its best to defend the dolphin that is in danger.  The dolphin’s main weapon against a shark attack is its snout, which is made up of very strong and thick bone and has a hard rounded end.  The dolphins circle the shark rapidly from different directions thus confusing the shark and rendering it unable to chase any of the other dolphins.
When a dolphin is positioned below a shark at a distance of several yards, the dolphin will often make a sudden rush at the shark’s soft underbelly and ram it with its snout.  The effect this has on the shark can be quite effective.  It resembles a powerful punch and can seriously injure a shark with just one blow.  When dolphins use this as their weapon against sharks, it often renders the shark stunned or knocks them unconscious immediately.  Sometimes a dolphin will repeatedly ram a shark that has been aggressive in order to protect itself or its group, and in some cases have even been known to kill large and dangerous sharks.  In most cases, even if the shark does not die as a result of the dolphin driving its snout into its underbelly, the force that it has on the shark will often leave some kind of internal damage.

Why is everyone panicking? We should have all known how volatile these markets are, and we should have all only put in what we can afford to lose.

@_date: 2018-02-01 13:41:10
If people actually use it as a currency it has value to it. I bought something with it yesterday and something with it today. People need to be obsessed with the technology, not the price. If you replenish what you spend immediately you are not subject to market volatility

Insurance has cost. And so do the fees for accepting credit cards. Merchants have to pay to let a customer swipe. These costs are then added to the goods and services they are selling. If you pay in cash. In a way you are subsidizing those who use credit.

lol, washing is subjective on how you approach it. but there are ways to stay anonymous despite the public ledger just as much as spending physical cash can be anonymous as well.

if your wallet is not attached to your name though there is a ledger of the transaction and for what amount but they still won't know who spent it or what for. i see it almost as me going to the ATM and pulling out 20 dollars and having a record of me withdrawing, but them having no clue what i spent that 20 dollars on. Honestly though, probably burritos from that baller taco truck in that one part of town.
