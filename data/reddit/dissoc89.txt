If you dont want a hardware wallet a bootable Linux USB live with persistence + Virtualbox will do the job. Only requires two USB sticks. 
Bit of a hassle but saves you 70€ :-) The VM will function as a safe enviroment. Can recommend multiwallets for this solution like Exodus. And i also only recommend this if you have a substantial amount of cryptos. Otherwise i don’t believe it is worth it. Its subjective though. 
A normal desktop wallet is fine on windows if you don’t visit malicious sites and open random files. KeyScrambler is also an option for extra security layer. Anti keylogger which scrambles your keystrokes in real time. Can protect your wallet password and then remember to generate your private word phrase offline and your good to go!

Bitstamp or BitPanda are great alternatives. I would give BitStamp a go :-)

Your options best options:
Coinbase 
BitPanda 
I will recommend to create a Revolut account for cashing out. Works perfect. Send your Money from one of the above exchanges to your revolut bank account and cash out from revolut to your own account :-)

Works perfect in most EU countries. Also their VISA and mastercard.

Well, no more portfolio apps are needed. Overflooded with it. Waste of you and your girlfriends time.

Perfect logic. Awaiting topic which dictates that all investors with under 100.000$ invested should shut the fuck up about holding. You see? Money is subjective and what is much for you, is maybe not much for someone else. And the other way around ofcourse. This is a quality shit post though!

Thanks for the elaboration and the knowledgeable answer. You clearly know what you talking about. Respectfully, It can be hard to seperate one product from the other. Seems every other day a new one is advertised. I will check your app out though :-)

But all these functions is already available in other apps. Blockfolio, Delta, Crypto Tracker, HODL App and so on. Just go in @ App store and check the numerous tools with the exact same features like yours :-)
