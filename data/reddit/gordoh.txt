This is such an eye opening comment. This is the first time I've ever converted my BTC holdings into Sats, and it looks much better. Instead of feeling helpless like im so far from 1 btc, it feels good thinking im a satoshi millionaire.

I used to use it often when I lived in sa. Last time I used it was tax season last year. No issues.

I unsubbed yesterday, I had no idea it was a BCH sub. It bothers me that these BCH shills are using as their sub instead of @_date: 2019-07-22 10:16:31
Tradie. I feel like its a waste of my potential but at least I can try educate the less tech savvy people in industry and trade jobs.

Personally I think in the long run we wont look at what its worth in dollars. We wont say dollars or cents when we talk about buying stuff. It will become sats.  
" How many sats for a big mac?"  
Thats where I think we are heading eventually l.

I wish they would put it in the description that it is a bitcoin trash sub. I was very confused for very long.

A good heart these days is hard to find

I did a transaction 19 hours ago with the blockchain.info wallet which hasn't gone through yet. Using tradeblock.com I see that the fee was 57.15 sat/B. I don't understand how bitcoinfees.21.co works though. It says delay 3-inf. Does that mean that the transaction could have an infinite delay? Please give me some advice on this.

Thank you for the information. It finally cleared now. after like 2 days lol
@_date: 2017-02-07 08:55:52
I have been waiting nearly 20 hours. I paid 57.15sat/B but it was automatically selected by blockchain.info when I did the transaction. I didn't know you could set your own fee until now.

Fair point. Truth is nobody knows so its all speculation
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:34:58
Well i hope you are right. I look forward to January to see what happens
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:55:13
I hear this kind of comment all the time. Next month is Christmas so people will be selling to buy presents, january nobody has money to buy, February is chinese lunar new year so chinese people will be selling to buy gifts. I dont believe any of it. Its market manipulation by whales, thats all.

He's not your buddy guy!

I thought so! Do the miners currently make money from tx fees? Also, how will it work? Im assuming the miner that completes the tx will get 100% of the fee. Is that right? Sorry for asking so many questions.

100 million satoshis = 1 Bitcoin

Is it probable that once the rewards get too low, people will stop mining and it will compromise the security of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:09:46
That means that the price has to keep increasing as in order to sustain the security of bitcoin. If the price doesn't increase then will it be the end for Bitcoin? Also, once all the coins are mined, how will the network maintain the security because I'm assuming there wont be miners right?

This looks like the bar from one of the old space quest games. Awesome work!
@_date: 2015-04-20 08:18:13
Its hard to make money in the crypto game. I would suggest rather try get a proper job and buy some bitcoin on the side as a hobby. Rather be safe than sorry, Nobody knows where Bitcoin will be in the future. I hope this helps.
