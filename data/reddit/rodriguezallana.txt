Can't wait for the next upgrade on blockchain, i'm sure it's going to be fascinating. My opinion, Blockchain wallet is the best and safest wallet only if you follow their security instructions. You only use your money if you don't abide by the security tips. If you are having coins missing,wallet issues,unusual access to your wallet by anonymous.

Please beware there are many fake bitcoin mining/clouding out there, I got scammed twice before I met a genius hacker who helped retrieve my bitcoin. The whole plan was so smooth I could not doubt it. Bitcoin is actually a great investment option but one thing I discovered over time is that it is not possible to mine bitcoin so don’t be deceived. I invested $250,000 on a particular website called bitcoincloudminer, I monitored the profit yielding but got locked out of the account before I could withdraw. I went online and met this recovery expert recoverywealthnow360 at geemail dot com  who helped me retrieve my bitcoins back in few hours. You saved my life and I will forever be grateful. I referred my friends whom we got scammed together right away and they got help too. You can contact recoverywealthnow360 at geemail dot com. Thank me later!
