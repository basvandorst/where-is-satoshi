what lost dominance are you referring to... technological hype?
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:18:07
he seems like the kind of person that would forget he has it, then check it a couple years later to find millions of dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:24:38
they're working on it
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:36:55
wait, do we not go to the moon with btc?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:32:31
in general how can it be free, doesn't any transaction carry a small fee to "pay" the computers?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:27:55
i saw a counter article that had the costs of processing gold. made bitcoin seem pretty good.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:26:57
still learning but trading fees are listed at .1%.
however they have their own coin, BNB, that if you use it to pay the fees, you get 50% off, so the fee is .05%. still looking into how that's paid exactly - seems like there's an option to automatically do it, so it might be a no brainer.
edit: seems the option means you have to already own some BNB to get the fee discount... not hard to get some, but means you need to have some sitting in your account.

yeah, either down or very slow loading.

as far as i could tell all the US exchanges got slammed with new users and getting verified is taking forever.
if you already have some crypto, try binance. pretty fast verification, but seems to trade using crypto as the primary currency. tons of different coins available, though.

let's all send Dorian danish butter cookies to show our support.

i really hope this is a meeting about how to buy audio equipment with bitcoin.
but really, who's going to be there? president of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:33:32
i think the vending business is slow to adapt, since each individual machine is not a big earner, and to buy a new vending machine is a large investment vs using/fixing a current one.
i've only very recently seen machines for soda pop/fizzy drink that take credit card. at that rate, we'll see btc machines in 10 years.
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:48:09
which sheets did you order that are now out of stock?
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:25:20
i thought in general the cheap prices on release day are russian/foreign CD keys... not sure if true or not.
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:46:45
we had a required econ class my senior year (there was also an AP option). this was 10+ years ago.
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:26:22
steam also needs to give me BTC for selling my hats in TF2.
or at least some dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:34:13
it'd be funny if the bitcoin was on a usb drive, and in 4 years no one uses USB anymore.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:06:30
i don't understand the question then =)
do you just call them butter cookies over there?
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:57:00
it's one of the items that were reviewed.
i had them when i was younger, i'm not a fan (different brand though).

also last night's NBA scores. Assange should just become a news anchor.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:17:30
get an NBA player to sign it and that team will win the championship.

is there an actual btc institution that has (well regarded) insurance?
@_date: 2016-11-17 21:25:37
bank if FDIC insured (assuming you trust the govt, etc).
btc is not.
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:40:53
it's definitely a good fit bc then crypto spending will be less anonymous.
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:20:55
what? dollars in a bank are insured... if someone robs the bank you don't lose anything up to 250k.
are we talking about the same thing here...
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:30:49
so what would solve the problem... educating everyone about bitcoin markets and not spending more than you can actually risk?
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:27:02
I'm with you, but my conclusion is that maybe people shouldn't be trusted with their money and government oversight is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:02:38
they just want to sell the "Steering wheel classic" addon that will fit over the existing one.
going the EA route.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:05:16
if you talked to a real person, consider yourself a lucky one.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:40:56
well they're going to have paper wallets so it'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:30:44
surprised at all the hate here. everyone looks smart during a bull run.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:13:19
you don't have to wait, you can get one for .5 btc right now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:48:53
tbh the 10k memes were pretty bad/non-existent.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:31:30
at least they solved their dust problem.
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:06:04
hey i have some too, will give to some of the newer posts.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:50:20
i think the best thing would be to create a fork called cBTC, with 100x more coins.
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:35:30
if you really did you should go back in time and add the spoiler warning.
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:15:01
how did they get video of this, did they invent time travel?
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:26:24
i mean that's great but it probably wasn't worth the electricity cost.
I refer to the local processing power to open your wallet and displaying the balance on screen.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:26:32
they'd probably wrap it in with PayPal and charge an admin fee.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:24:27
have a downvote.
