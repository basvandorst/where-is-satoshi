If you looking for dapps build on Ethereum network I would say Exchanges Kyber Network and IDEX. If you are friendly with NEO platform and some dapps build on top of them you should have install nOS on you desktop I personally like and follow them work from very beginning. If you looking for mobile wallets, I have a few of them I love ARK wallet its one of my favourite, Metaverse huge potential, O3 if you are holding NEP-5 tokens from NEO network, also Aphelion looks amazing.

Well I don't get your question. First of all I'm not British or American, so if you about my grammar. Second if you want explanation about my first post with tips: you don't need $9000 to buy Bitcoin just buy satoshi each time you have some backs. If Wirex Visa card available in US each tx on main street they will pay you % of cash back in satoshi. If you buy Bitcoin you can lend it with % on Binance. You can also use stacking for some alt coins and profit convert to Bitcoin on exchanges. For example  gave you over 20% in annual for staking and you can convert to Bitcoin any time you wish. Read about DPoS, PoS, TPoS research also   simply staking for beginners
@_date: 2018-10-22 20:03:45
So you can just make transaction in person easy ;)

1) Well so developers work on app. It's very often updated. You also on newest iPhone so I guess app need a update.
2) Customers service sorted out lots of my issues I created myself and they always responded in up to one hour. But you very welcome on Wirex telegram where you can have a help too.
3) If you dont like all mails just scroll down and unsubscribe them.
 
4) Wirex work awesome for me personally. I'm happy with them service. Sorry to hear your bad experience.

That's awesome. Thank you very much.
@_date: 2019-02-24 01:43:46
Coinomi it's not open source anymore as far as I know. But they develop awesome product. I'm user btw.
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:25:17

So how I can trust someone who engraved private key, didn't keep copie of it? Its awesome idea but only if you make it for yourself other way it's not safe.
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:52:28
We call this "private key" export to compatible Bitcoin wallet and you will recover your founds
@_date: 2019-04-17 11:19:39
If you don't have "privet key" provide from your personal wallet so you don't own any coins. So if you have an any seed or private key import to compatible wallet to recover funds.
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:42:33
Past your "private key" to exactly same wallet you got "key" from.
@_date: 2018-11-10 09:55:13
Ok so about Bitpay, there is some connection between Roger Ver and them so I think Bitcoin maximalist don't follow them also is centralized, and not open source code. Fees to be honest it's high everywhere in this space. I'm using Bitpay for past two years and no issue but I only pay in BTC online and some pay in BTC on main street Amsterdam never issue, but if you want to deal with customers service there is no best experience, at the moment I want to test Coinomi, also not open source code, but great build app.
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:01:19
I don't know what Country you based, but for myself, more safety and recommend way its Wirex card with mobile app build in exchange.
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:25:37
RIP my small caps. Classic scam exit. Very shady from beginning

Conversation should be 1,5% as I remember so best on market.
@_date: 2018-11-10 09:44:24
Also if you US citizen you can use .Bitpay, I applied for them visa, but unfortunately I'm in UK. You should be good with Bitpay
@_date: 2019-01-14 19:29:02
Is Blue wallet available for mobile, also If I want to use LN can transfer Bitcoin from original format of btc address to lightening address. TIA
@_date: 2018-11-04 16:04:53
So why he facking report this?
@_date: 2019-01-08 10:40:48
I guess for now Coinomi its best choice but it's support address "1", "3" also "bc1" 
@_date: 2018-11-05 05:16:20

Wirex! 10 verification, I'm using fir over one year, very safe. Build in few wallets, and ofcourse you can transfer you crypto to you personal wallet. Very recommended by me if you wish you can use this link so both of us on your first purchase can earn up to £10 BTC Come and join me at Wirex!
 
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:53:31
In Wirex you can withdraw in cash point, but not by transfer to  your bank account you can, also withdraw your crypto. No transfer to bank account.
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:51:46
If you can't afford expensive ASIC for real mining, then I have for you solution for beginning. Set up your Visa Wirex and you will earn satoshi each time you pay in shop by card. I just left McDonald's after breakfast and earned 600 sats. You can also you my link so I guess its $10 bucks for you and I. Enjoy your experience mate.
