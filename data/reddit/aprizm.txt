Wow, File under paranoiac 12 y-o who don't really understand anything about how the financial works lol. But lets entertain the fact that VISA would declare war on crypto... Don't you think crypto is a threat to their business model ? So that would be a motivation if they ever needed one.

@_date: 2018-01-07 19:00:35
from what Ive heard a lot of the on-stage people are in on it. They work for the bald guy and If they are not well there is a psychological factor when you want to believe so much in something that your brain will generate patterns and you will interpret them as you want.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:06:08
im pretty sure people using GPUs arent mining BITCOIN lol do your research my guy

@_date: 2018-01-18 17:26:40
Its a psychological thing, people (especially insecure people) need constant validation so that they don't feel less than. Since bitcoin is a revolution nobody wants to be the person who didnt get in at the right time. So its easier to just believe it was a scam so that they dont feel bad not understanding it or taking part in it. anyways fudge those normies.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:44:02

You do realize that were not living in the middle age right? nowadays information is worth more than gold. So why do you think it has no real life value? The WHOLE goddamn network is the value. You potentially don't understand the importance of this new technology.

Sadly the reality of Fibonacci is that its a self-fulfilling prophecy. That being said if enough people use it to trade it will become a thing. Read on game theory it might help you understand this concept.

@_date: 2018-01-25 12:04:11
You need to understand that we have evolve in a society that works by aggregating everybody's money and use it to build the infrastructure (city, roads, hospital(Canada) etc) So if everybody would stop using fiat and stop paying taxe then the world would be a very fucked up place.

Why do you talk to conbase in here, dont assume they spend time in here go on twitter brah
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:56:34

@_date: 2018-01-03 12:25:06
Yeah im sure they talk about bitcoin in the qoran :))))
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:22:07

@_date: 2018-01-04 18:41:06
lol this idea sounds like a scam in itself
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:04:32
no offense but this guy has no idea. Ok hes an engineering student but managing money is an art more than a science and this guy is not cutted for it. lol Ive seen gamblers with better money management skills than this guy. What was he expecting ? making a shiton of money every week lol 
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:27:38
how many more time are people going to make this joke *sigh*
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:30:05

@_date: 2018-01-21 11:39:35
Not sure if its part of this but my exchange (soon to be ex) Coinsquare still charges 0.0025 to send crypto away so I believe it must be exchange that are still sending those in an automated way. On Coinsquare I cant even use a cheaper fee. to them its 36$ im guessing they use 5$ fees and pocket 31 which is a huge scam imho. Quadriga here i come

Honestly the fear of not waiting until at least 2020 to think about selling is haunting me to this day. To me its simple : I rather lose it all while trying to do something extraordinary than just have a little because it was the safe thing to do at the moment. nobody gets rich playing safe 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:26:01
dont you think people are spending way too much atm ? so that would just be a nice lil correction

@_date: 2018-01-30 18:43:05
If you want an honest opinion don't try to engage with them. Troll them instead its better for your soul. People want the instant gratification, they don't want to wait for a smarter solution or something appropriate.

My take on this is we are not chemtrails believers and that p-o-w takes some sacrifice and energy is a good one since most of the extra unused energy ends up being lost. So the fact that we are now using it to build this infrastructure is a miracle. Enjoy da future

you lost me lol
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:14:15
well its a good start especially if you have no db background. In a way blockchain is an evolved shared-db. Don't worry about learning stuff, learn as much as you can about everything and you will be surprise in the end how everything will connect together :) good luck to you my friend
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:47:58

@_date: 2017-12-20 23:53:18
youre right, its almost like having your coins on Coinbase instead of a real hardware wallet like a man would use.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:38:24
sorry Buffett but this technology is too profound for you and you are wrong. Its producing value in ways that you cant even imagine yet. Time will teach you
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:52:03
we attack Ver on his character because thats the worst part of him. Also he has no technological knowledge worth debating so its like fighting with a child. Havent you see him doing the finger, he just cant help himself. Intellectually hes a little boy
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:10:13
I just can't wait for BCH to crash to oblivion and hopefully Roger Ver(min) loses most of his money and maybe just then he will become a less arrogant piece of shiet
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:30:12
yeah I predict 25k by first january
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:02:26
if you hodl to the past tense it means youre not hodling anymore which is bad so dont talk about it.

wow thats stupid. When you watch a weather forecast you don't follow it on a 5min charting software so financial weather should be tackled the same. You maniac
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:22:25
dude hodl that shit another year and youll have like 50-60$ 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:25:56
Core could dev a program to verify the blockchain's conformity before unpacking. That would not be the only way to build a rig, just an easier path for those of us who dont have the resources 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:49:29

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:21:33
youre actually wrong, most people try to buy low and sell high and fail so this guy decided to sell low and buy high knowing that he will fail at that hence winning at the real strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:34:44

@_date: 2017-12-23 13:27:03

@_date: 2017-12-23 18:31:26
lol ben doesnt even understand the internet so give him a break lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:13:32
If only there was a way that the nodes could get some cut of the fees, I bet you there would be X100 the number of running nodes. It would give an incentive and motivate a lot of peeps
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:04:02
they are still selling it 1000$ higher so fuk em 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:26:04

@_date: 2017-12-24 12:35:49

Bcash shill alert
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:06:29
Thats very interesting, I hope nobody abuses this for evil. Imagine replaying a tx with higher fees and front-run the original. Hopefully im pretty sure there is something to prevent this from being abused. Reason why yours is working is probably because you cancelled the original tx from your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:47:06
wow people are idiots, the golden rules of investing is : 
Invest what you can afford.

coinsquare is the one im using and it works great. I can send money right from my bank account
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:28:09

Roger Vermin aka The Bitcoin Judas

Yeah because exchange lets you play with IOUs instead of real actual btc. Btw transfering btc to an hw wallet is not considered selling :P
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:54:39
hes such a snake I cant wait for him to fall.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:00:39
I just found a message from Hal to Satoshi... I know it could be a decoy but I don't really believe it. 


Quote from: Hal on December 11, 2010, 08:08:45 PM
I'd like to hear some specific criticisms of the code. To me it looks like an impressive job, although I'd wish for more comments. Now I've mostly studied the init, main, script and a bit of net modules. This is some powerful machinery. (end of comment)
Satoshi's response :
That means a lot coming from you, Hal.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:34:05

ill give you 200 satoshis for a bottle of tears
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:18:57
maybe they could start selling pre-filled external Harddrive that would have most of the blockchain already on it so you only have to update it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:14:19
also Bitcoin Diamond and Bitcoin X (BCX)
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:29:46
they are so stupid they actually think this is going to cost 2mm to spend. as if the internet archive is going to use this to buy stuff with btc lol they are definitely going to convert it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:30:52

@_date: 2017-12-22 14:17:40
Bitcoin is not your usual market please stop acting like you know how this will play out because the truth is you dont.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:03:20
I think the more they are going to try to attack bitcoin the stronger it gets. This annoying part of crypto history is kind of necessary. If we don't battle-test our own structure the big banks wont have any problem trying to kill it. Do you know how bad the oil industry tried to kill the electric car ? Dont  you think big banks at some point will try to do the same... :D Bring it on, you cant stop progress
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:15:54
Just had a terrific idea, im going to register like 3000 wallet and hope to get lucky with these guys who cant seem to double check their addresses before sending money
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:27:20

the same Goldman Sachs who was hit for mortgage bond fraud ??? lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:25:39
no theyre not, people who follow Roger vermin aka The Bitcoin Judas have no interest in the potential and the reach that this technology has. All they want "ironically" is to control a part of it and theyre not even subtle about it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:09:49
who the hell leaves 300k on an exchange in the first place lol what was the plan ?
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:00:31
Its understood that walmart will screw their employee and will aggressively discount to get the market share. So yeah we know why they are doing it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:18:43
I personally dont even flinch, but lately Ive started to convince people to get in now they might think I am an idiot but in 10 years well see :D

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:13:19

@_date: 2017-12-23 13:58:57

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:33:04

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:42:54

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:12:07
the fucking emperor has no clothes even their bots are shitting in their boots at their telemarketing center
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:17:01
Im using Coinsquare, but wait until the fees are down before you withdraw it back. It usually takes 3-4 days before they let you withdraw so be aware of this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:14:51
dont look at it, make an entry in your calendar and check it like once a month a every 2 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:19:47
Bitcoin Core needs to reward node with a cut of the fees, so that we can get from 9000 nodes to like 9million nodes aka unstoppable
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:33:17

it wasnt easy, but I did it. I added to my position at 14k then it dropped even harder... my heart sank and 2 sec later I was buying again. The thing that keeps me motivated is that im telling myself : if this was easy everybody would do it, be ready to do things other wont so that later I can live a life they cant afford

@_date: 2017-12-04 13:24:32
Easy, because women are genetically less incline to take risks. They take care of the babies and are driven by feelings so it would be a bad combo. lol I get the feeling I'm going get downvotes to hell for this. oh well
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:13:11

are you sure I just checked and it says 32.46$  yesterday it was 28$ at some point
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:55:49
Your face when : They all take instagram pictures of it to brag to their friends LOL please warn em about the keys lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:54:45
lol this is funny and accurate lol I love that womyn on the left lol so dumb
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:38:44
lol youre kinda right there: I have some coins on an exchange that im waiting to transfer just because the fees are too high. But I seriously cant wait to transfer it back to my real wallets
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:30:17
what if my enemy is Tai Lopez?
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:26:33
They actually refused it because they thought 35$ was too much fee for a btc tx. They are waiting BCH offers... LOL 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:39:21
ask your dad to make a Coinsquare account and do it there
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:13:45
could you draw bitcoin judas aka Roger Vermin 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:31:55
 2 BTC = 30K and youre affraid the 30$ fees will eat it all
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:44:41
technically he will have to pay the capital gain at the time of the purchase which is going to be complicated since theyre is many. fred is fucked lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:31:50
you joke but thats how trump won the election.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:23:16
hahah kids lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:27:45
Read a little more on the subject because you seem to be on the right track except the part where you don't buy it. What is there to buy ? The less time you have to access the blockchain the less you will be able to congest the network since the ln will catch it first and feed it to the mothership in the end.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:38:24
why did u put it in the cat litterbox?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:05:53
dude stop insulting bitcoin master with your low offerings !!!! lol just kidding. of course its enough. Just add to it dont think about it and in 5 years you will be happy
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:24:30
sorry i dont trust foreign link
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:02:20
how the hell this guy gets 300k in the first place, this story makes absolute no sense. Also the price is back up :D 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:11:51
long time lurker (guy joined in january) :P 
Also the point of investments is to set em and forget em. So don't blame bitcoin for being addictive you shouldve just bought some and totally forgot about it and wake up in 10 years with a good surprise. anyways weak hands
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:50:13
Linux is technologically better than windows, yet Windows is the winner. Explain how linux is not winning since it has better dev, tech etc... 
Then explain me why bitcoin would win against a shitcoin like bcash or ltc
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:15:02
easy, the sheer volume of those low tx is enough evidence. You cant justify this in any logical way lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:25:28
bch literally means bcrash now
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:24:29
Well for one the blockchain is less accessed so technically it makes it impossible or very very very very expensive to actually clog the whole thing.
Instead of sending every transaction to the blockchain until it makes a block the LN will group em beforehand and send complete blocks at one time. Its way more efficient and I cant wait to see it in action.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:18:43
that made me lol
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:17:24
hahah theres some gems in there : A friend of mine is up nearly a grand having put 1000 into ithereim (sp?) and 500 to bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:34:53
got in at 4K :) I am not stressed at all. See thats the key the longer you hodl the less you have to stress about it.
Also have a plan that doesnt require you to check the price every 2 min for your sanity
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:58:17
Very good analysis, except when you say we cant blame them... I mean the only reason we are in cryptos is because bank dont behave honestly.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:17:05
wow sir you are an official retard
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:25:29
what if he doesnt tell you his passphrase ? you kill him, no gain
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:05:53
also usually a bubble is build on false promises, thats why i don't consider the dot com to be a bubble. It was built on the promise that it would bring the world (the citizen) together. Now with Bitcoin and the blockchain they will soon be able to join us again in the financial world. So I don't think bitcoins price is overpriced.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:21:27
thats what I love about Roger Vermin, whenever he gets call out for something crazy he said : he doubles down :DDD 
its going to be nice seeing him fall 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:05:09
When I read your title I could hear Roger Vermin's voice in my head. HI Im Roger Ver the first crypto investor blablablabla
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:03:27
Yeah in commerce its a given and people assume that they pay fair prices (usually the prices are the same or close in different stores), in finance its called a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:01:40
sounds like a scam youre trying to get people to send you free coins :P
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:13:22
wish this was a video, i love to see Roger get upset.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:11:36
its not our fault our currency is worth more than yours, when bitcoin was measly 3500 those fee wouldnt look so huge now. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:23:22
meanwhile bcash is a cardboard box with wheels drawn on it
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:58:52
wanna bet ?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:19:03
Roger Vermin? oh yeah the bitcoin judas
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:38:15
lol I was thinking the same
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:50:43
to be fair its in front of a police station
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:04:43
honestly I totally enjoyed that interview. he was totally trying to avoid saying : Were trying to takeover bitcoin lol but you could read it in his eyes
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:53:41
also you didnt buy Google and Apple stocks 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:00:41
im gonna start using bitchcoin cash aswell
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:43:21
yawnnnn meanwhile in reality btc is preparing for the war
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:24:27
hey thanks for the link and also stop being so contentious this is not Satoshi's original vision
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:03:32
yeah we need a truck to hold all those coins 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:56:38
its called African-american friday :P 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:50:24
yep :) discount time boys :D get your dip buying money ready 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:52:32
that would imply that he sold it at top which most people wont. You dishonest malicious forking peace of sheet
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:36:42
then you could disguised your traffic as something super normal and use another layer to pass the data. I won't go into the technicals but whatever they do if they angry hackers they will regret their careless actions.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:58:00
 Well first thing is gov money is going to dry up so well finally start losing most of benefits we were paying for. Which is not a problem since most of  the these utilities can be replaced with a blockchain equivalent. So don't think gov will lose control of the whole money in one sweep, it will take years until we are able to blockchaintivize every aspect of the structure. But it will happen it has no choice to.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:38:54
I understand it but why would someone give money for a post lol maybe I havent read one worthy yet
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:10:30
youre a good crypto-samaritan :D
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:12:39
Well technically there are instant in the fact that you will receive the amount of btc at that price at that moment. But yeah it sucks they hold to it. I guess it has to do with anti-money laundering laws or something
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:38:37
its not sad man, if everybody would be into btc it would be harder to buy it :) were the pionneers. keep buying and stop looking sideways
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:22:45
lol thats cool that you BROUGHT it but who bought it ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:02:36
ahhh man I wish I could see Roger's face when he sees this
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:05:41
are they seriously trying to patent our (the people) technology ? Hope they burn in a chemical fire. Whats next they will try to patent water
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:50:56
those are coinbase fees bro lol look it up
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:41:26
bclashic is the future muh frends
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:36:54
you sound like a nazi appologist
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:31:55
adding 3500$ every month is not a small hodler :P 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:33:52
You know when its so bad its becoming good ? well this is NOT one of those time :P
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:16:54
dip to 7777
then 10K 
also BCH will be dismantle
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:09:41
I buy on coinsquare and have to wait 3-4 days before I can transfer to my trezor. Its okay I usually buy on wednesday and like saturday Im able to transfer it all to my HW WALLET
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:24:51
hey its bcash's own Roger Vermin
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:55:59
shouldnt it be the opposite ? stay with your btc dont flirt with those black friday deals
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:52:48
This post is aligned with Satoshi's Original Vision ! I support this
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:55:21
dude when it goes back to 100$ you probably will be dead and wont be able to talk lol but seriously it will never go to 100$ unless there is macro deflation of fiat usd which I dont think is even possible.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:50:58
finally tru vision of satoshis 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:35:21
so reasonable, ok lets start analyzing this puppy:
What we know
-Not english speakers (probably not from america because of the way the sentence are builded. Could be google translate) 
-Probably comes from a country so poor that 8K sounds like life changing money to this guy, yes I say guy because I don't believe this is a team.
The fact that he start by saying I and then goes into we makes me think theres no WE its only an I. 
anybody has a guess on what country could this be coming from?
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:51:45
honestly the shit has hit the fans so I doubt that we will live another crash, another dip maybe. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:35:52
The fact that we aren't talking about it should tell you what we think about it. To us this doesn't even exist.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:42:45
cockroaches always disappear when you turn on the light,in this case the light is the moon :D Hodl forever
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:06:59
yeah, usually like on bitfinex it took an hour before my withdrawal was reviewed and processed then came the btc transaction which took like 10-30min
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:27:54
I did a hashtag with bitcoin in it and same thing for me lol
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:42:38
looks like a very interesting idea sadly I don't trust most of the google store apps because lets be honest theres is no way to figure if this app is trying to hack other mobile wallet or hack your email to access your coin on an exchange and maybe even hack your sms at this point. anyways good idea. make a desktop version with open source on GITHUB im really intrigue to know what kind of machine learning technique you've been using :) 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:02:56
sadly very on point :P
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:38:31
Also if you think about fiat, the way its printed, transported and needed to be held into secure warehouse. In the end I am pretty sure cost way more than making bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:33:42
also larger than BCH oops i meant r/BTC/
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:00:16
hahah rage quitting pathetic response
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:50:15
dude you too late you are the last person to get in, im sorry were at capacity *go back in the line*
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:35:50
BTC doesn't even notice BCH, its beneath it
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:33:07
file under drama-alert alike bullshit
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:32:42
If you need to ask please leave reality and go buy bonds or something
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:12:30
They could actually patent a process build on top of the Blockchain but that would be shitty since the whole point of this technology is how open and everybody can use it. Satoshi  would not approve
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:57:09
lol yeah thats pretty much it lol cant stop watching the loop tho. now i need to find the whole fight
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:49:38
yeah hes trying to create himself a good dip
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:40:20
lol the bank in your pocket is more advanced than the one you're visiting.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:28:55
those guys are real mvp hodlers :D dont waste their time with BCH. You go there to buy giant tubs of coffee not little lady cups.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:59:04
lol its call the art of trolling, let us have our fun with him

lets buy 30sec and explain why bch is NOT bitcoin :) lets have a PSA
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:56:11
Satoshi's originally envisioned a world where pronographies would be decentralized. This is pretty much aligned with the oracle's vision. Long live cybersexdependance it will change crypto 4ever
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:13:41
said the 2 weeks redditor :P
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:40:35
Of course a redditor for 1 week. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:03:45
let em celebrate, it will even better when it blows in their face and backstab eachother trying to find who is the culprit :) meanwhile you and me will have the hard choice of what color our lambos should be.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:55:27
haha i love how he called it bcash :D this guys fox
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:27:20
The real flooders are those USD$0.01 transaction polluting the mem pools. We should find a way to batch these transaction on separate network.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:18:28
fees are in bitcoin and believe you me, when bitcoins are all mined it will skyrocket so those fees will be well worth your efforts.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:55:43
lol its okay we dont need weak hands hodling :P
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:50:36
Dude let me stop you right here, you don't understand this vehicule and stop comparing it to other financial product. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:16:57
god our money is beautiful tho :D I can't believe US is not revising their ugly green money at this point
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:18:37
From what ive read its important to let company do what they want and not have the gov telling em to operate, that being said the company have some sort of access monopoly when it comes to connecting to the internet. We need to punish them by making a more powerful wireless technology that would permit everybody on earth to connect for free to the internet.

as much as I love those macintosh and the lc computers they were considered fringe and PC was the master race (as today) 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:29:41
not really some things do stifle innovation while other completely kills it. The gov intervening so that we get a fairer market is not against my beliefs. The hell dude you think im some kind of anarcho idiot ? lol 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:00:58
Honestly I don't trust Roger anymore and to me anything thats not BTC (core) is an altcoin so I don't waste my time with these cheap knockoffs
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:43:58
Pro tip : just say like 3500$ (in bitcoin) because youll go crazy following the price. :D
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:55:22
dont hidl just hodl
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:01:43
I don't think I don't like where this is not going
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:30:17
I want to buy one aswell but for us canadian its almost 10k lol 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:51:58

@_date: 2017-11-10 17:31:43
he used to look like Artie Lange lol 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:19:35
It would be funny if in like 5000 years people who think about printing bitcoin and went back to fiat because theyre too stupid and didn't have any trace in history to benchmark their ideas against.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:02:38
You're so wrong its funny to us. Keep talking da manure my friend and well keep crushing your sad attempts
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:23:28
Love this guy, where can I susscribe to him ?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:58:38
yep its the og vision bcash 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:53:52
haha this guy had like 5K of bch and now all he can afford his mcaddies lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:45:14
Just because your altcoin uses the bitcoin name doesn't mean its the same quality. Rip Bitcoin C(r)ash
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:38:02
Yep that is exactly the way this is suppose to work, meaning that the system should be designed to make it so expensive to people trying to break the network that they would actually be helping by trying to hurt it.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:33:10
weird they made a typo : It's Hodl
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:35:56
replace gold coin with bcash coins and you got my luls.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:24:15
lol ok thanks guys for the precision, now I feel like ive jumped to this guy's throat without double checking. is it too LaTttttttttttte to appologize
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:06:04
I give the finger(he gave us) to that apology, you goddamn Ver(min)
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:43:59

@_date: 2017-11-22 14:21:33
because nobody cares about tether
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:56:38
What you fail to mention is all the other 99% of dot com that went up in flame. lol but okay 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:11:50

@_date: 2017-11-20 18:47:57
TLDR;  so basically the tool that pretend to help you verify if there is a virus is a VIRUS itself. Honestly people get your fucking life in order and don't ever trust a url when it comes to security. Also do your own security checks don't trust any claims (especially in ads) .
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:50:32
im glad but honestly dude dont make a post every time your dick's get's hard. We have bigger fish to fry over here :P
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:49:46
yeah just do like openbazaar and you say :
this cost 10 USD (in bitcoin) 
so it will convert to whatever the value was at the time of the transaction
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:42:03
Domian names are so overrated. its like about dem onion address

and yet a proud hodler who wont stand for this cheap trickery known as bitcoin-c(r)ash
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:27:55
It does matter what if someone replay your transaction with different settings and gets confirmed before you :) oops 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:44:52

If you see Jihan please ask him about BCASH :D
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:49:16
well in Canada its already 10k sooo lets see this
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:21:51
You are very shady my friend. Satoshi's original vision is decentralized and you're trying to hide your intentions by not telling us your idea. Don't worry about someone stealing it from you (its expected). They will fork your idea my friends but don't worry it barely ever works
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:47:48
technically it didnt close over 9k 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:58:02
lol please someone tweet that at Roger Ver(min)
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:38:19
Welcome my friend :D get ready for maximum profits and no contentious bullshit! You are now part of Satoshi's original vision. He would be proud.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:11:34

Wow we have a bcash hodler over here lol Dude by posting this you expose how little you actually understand of how and why trading works so keep being mad and hopefully you will die young and people around you won't have to deal with your very toxic attitude and stance towards others and things you don't understand.

attack ? or you mean those greedy narcissistic vermin who tried to takeover our badger? Don't worry, they arent patient enough they have good ideas but arent willing to debate them and wait for the right time so they end up looking like idiot when it doesnt work. I truly believe in core's philosophy and the fact that nobody can takeover btc is a testament to their good decisions until now.

Its an obvious malicious takeover that did not work. The people spearheading it aren't as smart as they would lead us to believe and bigger blocks is stupid. We don't need bigger blocks... we need smarter blocks.  anyways I understand this is a lot to take in all at once but believe me BITCOIN is the original and the only true worthy investment, all the other bitcoin are like stupid experiments

from what ive seen even when you own a bitcoin you dont own a bitcoin but a many fractions of a bitcoin that equates to a bitcoin. Now if you buy a fresh new bitcoin in one transaction I guess you could own a total 1 piece coin.

I came here to express the same message. 
If you only transact in btc, It's going to be near impossible for the IRS to figure out what you doing. Bitcoins should only be taxed if they are converted in dollars which would equate to a property sales tax.

@_date: 2017-09-29 15:02:29
You're right, thats why wallstreet dont like it. They can't squeeze it like they usually do. The fun part is their greediness is taunt by this volatility but this is just a way for  nature (math) to kill the cancerous financial elements of our system. Once they're gone btc will truly succeed and we will celebrate with our drinks in the air. :D

@_date: 2017-09-29 15:32:55
Just keep what you can afford to lose, but that being said : making a killing is never easy and thats exactly why. Just ask yourself : can you live with the knowledge that you had a stake but decided to liquidate it because it was 'too complicated' when the price goes to 200K. Its like that guy who sold his Apple share and basically dumped million of dollars that he couldve made in the future. 
anyways its your call :P

Maybe in a spot where theres a lot of tourist it could work. Tourist instead of getting rekt by the forex could use their crypto and get the most out of it.

how the hell can they seize  bitcoin? somebody didnt do a good job. they probably had an account on coinbase or something
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:24:25
its only a bubble if youre trying to git rich quick.
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:53:09
Actually thats the exact reason why they hate it. Because they FEEL like they understand what it is but they usually dont.  
Honestly at first I thought it was just some AIRMILES, STEAM, FACEBOOK COINS kind of money. Only after you understand how it works under the hood you have no choice but to see the potential of the blockchain technology and how it will "hopefully" shape our future.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:23:35
yeah he went on saying these are paid actors lol but the funny part is we dont care about these accusations because were decentralized. He feels attacked because his coin relies on him and Jihan.

lol no but from the look of it it always look like nobody is living there. Hell it looks more like a small company office not the home of a normal human.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:38:00
Have you ever heard of delayed gratification... there is no reason to switch 100% crypto atm. This technology is going to change everything and we owe it to ourselves to get it right because the consequence can be disastrous. What Roger is doing (fork+big block) is not a good idea and it would damage the network in the long run. So stop with this ITS USABLE NOW because nobody will use it except to make twitter donation and useless shit like that.

Yeah but guys like Roger Ver calls the coin BITCOIN CORE aswell... I know its a sad attempt at trolling (much like his BCH PLS shirts which basically is calling his own coin BITCH COIN xd xd xd ) But its also confusing for newcomers... So thats why we defend that term.

actually when I started trading 10 years ago people were making fun of buy-n-hold because shorting was so much sexier ( betting on the demise of something ) but now we have Bitcoin which is a pivotal moment in human history where we are decentralizing the power of money without the  consent on the power that be. If thats not poetic then I dont know what is. what was the question again ? sorry Im preachy

yeah Roger was super insulted when people ask if he was doing this (paying shills) which makes me think that he did it. He should have just said no and when on to another topic. The fact that he becomes extremely unstable during those question makes me think hes trying to deflect.

@_date: 2017-09-13 14:45:09
That would actually make a lot of sense since market manipulation is a crime and nobody should be shielded of those accusations
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:15:17
I understand where you are coming from with this, but let me tell you this: Everything you own is subject to misuse so its not really an issue here. Yes it is a bit more complicated when you become the only responsible of your money, but it also brings a torrent of advantage :  lower transaction fees, Unfrozable assets and a certain security because you can physically hide your keys anywhere in the world to name a few. 
So basically there's a learning curve to understand how to secure it but once you're there nothing can stop you.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:21:39
Because the whole thing with bitcoin is the decentralization of power and well China is all about the centralization of power. So implying that China wants bitcoin is so against their best interests that it has to be a conspiracy.

@_date: 2018-02-09 15:09:58
There is such thing as being logically sound but morally wrong, so your logic is playing against you in your example(your first line).
My position on BCH is technical first and then moral, Roger Ver(min) being the big honcho of that technology has the ability to confuse newcomers by trying to convince them that BCH is the real BTC which is very unethical to say the least. I will keep pointing it out every time this snake pop his head out in the media.

@_date: 2017-09-25 15:30:30
dude its already priced in. to put it bluntly : every time youll have an idea about the market you wont be the first guy to think about it, hell its someone's job (out there) to know these things before you and act on them. That being said you could take advantage of the movement generate by these early informed big players, because one thing they can't do with such big accounts is to move in silence. So you can actually surf their waves

@_date: 2017-09-12 13:25:48
The funny part about all this is that Bitcoin (or the underlying technology) is (by design) unstoppable by any kind of governments. So the mere fact that they are trying to render it illegal will only highlights how easy it is for a chinese with bitcoins to trade on another platform.  Of course now we need an exchange that is willing to accept chinese customers... WE NEED A DECENTRALIZE EXCHANGE ! :) coming soon.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:49:32
Honestly if you understand the implication of this technology you wouldn't think of it as wasteful. The problem with retarded ecologist like you is that you will block anything youre affraid of. Did you know that nuclear power could power the whole world and its very safe... No because you live under a narrative of dumbass hippies who are affraid to hurt the ants but have no problem hurting the plants(which by your logic should be protected since they have a nervous system).

I speak french as my first language and basically they say: 
Gold is real crypto is not. So they end up talking about maybe to buy bitcoin as a form of hedging against fiat currency. 
What I think its funny with these articles is : 
1st they said it was a fraud
2nd they said it was a bubble
3rd now it might be good for hedging
you see where this is going right? no need to trace any trend line to see that they are going to praise it in a year or so. 
So sell your house, wives and kids and buy the dip

what is this scam ?
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:39:15
Yeah people just don't understand the technology and difference between this and other currencies (or stocks). So they listen to what you just said and they come in the comments asking stuff like : so in 3 months whats the target? STOP TRYING TO PREDICT THE GODDAMN MARKET. 
Just buy what you can afford (preferably when its dropping = better bang for your bucks)
Thats it ! HODL NEVER FODL 
if every time it drops you start selling some, you are doing the exact opposite of what you should do.
 
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:26:05

I hope jackie chan plays him when they make a movie about bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:02:12
Maybe the stores could give a little rebate when using bitcoins since theyre saving on CC fees which would give incentive to use it instead of fiat.

"While rogue states have practiced counterfeiting even longer than they have been computer hacking, counterfeiters are easier to catch. Once a cryptocurrency is stolen, it is virtually impossible to stop the new owner from spending it, and doing so in untraceable ways."
Are these guys for real ? Instead of focusing on the fact that crypto cannot be counterfeit hence destabilizing the economy they try to scare us about the fact that money will be spent and we wont be able to trace it. Well newsflash idiots : real fiat us money is being used as we speak to sponsor crimes around the world and since the money is being cleaned it's ALSO impossible to trace back. 
These articles are hurting my brain, since when these senior journalist are becoming such dumbasses.

Your level of innocence is kinda cute.

At first I was like : nice more support for hodlers.
Then Ive noticed the last line : GET YOUR BETS AT STOCKBET
Then ive noticed OP`s name ... 
nice promo dude :P
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:11:39
Yeah listen to CNBC 
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:14:10
I go to BTC because I study psychology and I love to see how they pat each other on the back while creating an incredibly skewed narrative lol. gotta love human behaviours.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:31:48
Who are you talking about ? 2Xer ? or is it dogecoin owners ? please explain this is important
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:33:37
nice straw man but no were not talking about actual usage but store here. Can't tell if youre stupid or trolling...
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:30:27
Wow you got scammed about a scam. Marketing manager is a scam in itself. Btw If you don't mind me asking... why did you pay him in bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:17:23
This is (to me) akin to the french revolution when the people had enough and decide to take back power from those cruel aristocrats (bankers).
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:28:17
Finally an honest way to use those mining javascript snippets.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:43:42
its an history report why would it be fake
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:46:17
they're basically trying to make it real by repeating enough time. they are delusional lol
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:54:15
Its nice to see this community is filled with humble folks :P
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:09:22
this is what weak hands look like
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:52:57
not to be an asshole but people were saying that at: 7k, 8k, 9k, 10k,12k etc 
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:00:57
Haha I made the math an hour ago actually. I need to buy 50k USD worth of bitcoins at present value
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:12:59
oh and the asian girl too
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:49:04
lol -63 points lol youre a brave soul posting that NOW DEBUNKED post
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:57:07
maybe because im part of the community but I honestly thought people understood it was a shared ledger at least. But wow this is eye opening... people just have no idea yet that this will change everything. I think we should be talking more about the trust-less part of the technology.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:52:27
too bad, im sucked in. they had me at FREE 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:10:38
what if its been flashed to check another url :P
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:53:14
I dont know why but your comment made me laugh a little too hard. Not even sure I interpreted it correctly :)))) 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:32:31
why not switch to TESLA ?
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:16:04
I already wear my moon-flying-lambo socks for the occasion
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:57:31
I think Eidoo is actually an exchange I could be wrong. But yeah it would be nice if the exchange would let us use our hardware wallet to hold our bitcoins when were not in a transaction.
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:15:42
You seemed somewhat schooled on logic and yet you get scammed this easily by guys like Roger and Craig... lol good luck in life 
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:20:03
uhh who cares what you think. please prove it 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:46:49
now that its back down... lol sorry 
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:49:09
dude come on this is the 2nd rule of this board : 
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:30:22
low fees is bad but even that's better than the actual fiat system in place right now. The only reason why you get instant money is because they are fronting it to you, with a fee of course. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:51:49
thanx for the find :D also it works look at the charts right now
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:25:18
Im actually out now and waiting to catch the falling knife for the comeback :)  and yes it is called timing the market
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:26:04
wait what picture ?
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:36:41
Honestly to invest in BTC you need the 2 B's.  
Brains &amp; Balls 
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:27:39
I cant believe we have to explain that to people.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:30:42
200 000 usd ??? are u crazy lol
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:27:19
Ill split the pub prize money with you in doge.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:55:33
You should short that gf and buy more bitcoins with the profits (if any, seems like a bad one)
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:43:08
Hey there, you seem to be lost little one. Here go play with your friends in here . Its cute when little trolls get lost from their groups. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:01:17
yeah stop telling people to read the whitepaper lol they wont get it. they need to examples. Check out Andreas for good use cases
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:05:17
First they laugh at you, then when a drop of sauce is worth 10K they start to fear you ! :*_*:
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:57:34
thanx for quick reply but I meant saying BOYES instead of candlestick or bars
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:29:49
What a scammer, now shes using her SJW friends to try to portrait her as a victim... She didn't code it herself so she should at least give credit to whoever actually did the code. If she stole some code (aka copy and paste) she should be forthcoming about it. What made people mad is the clear attempt at looking smart... No offense but this will hurt women's cause in the end because every time we hear about them its negative... Where are my real coding gals out there ? 
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:31:19
are you fomophobe?
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:25:25
hes like a robot with a shitty grin
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:24:01
now youre gonna get your celium wallet hacked and youre going to come cry about it in here :)  /prediction
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:13:17
lol youre right but he also said that crypto was a bubble so you cant just pick your favorite part about what he says lol
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:56:21
check what is the best gpu mined crypto and choose it
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:03:21
awww its like the doge version of cat-talk :D thanx dude you delivered
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:33:20
Naw, but you can buy any of those artist with bitcoins for a sexy night

MY BALLS ARE READY for the dOrP^!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:17:46
lol they should make prisoners mine by hand as forced work.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:56:01
get a knife to go with the fork and youll be ready for supper
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:52:45

@_date: 2017-10-10 13:06:33
haha thank god I transfer some coins this morning. OOOF :D that was close 
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:22:42
please post it on paste-bin or something :D 
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:40:01
to be fair fiat money could be the same we just have no way to calculate people exchanging dollars with each other
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:12:34
Bitcoins and crypto in general are like a puff of smoke so when they try to catch it POOF they have nothing to hold on to. For some reasons they dont seem to grasping that part of the technology. Its like torrents. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:51:45
I wish I could call up my bank and ask for a big loan and when they ask what for... urgh akward
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:31:54
yeah the bit coin (as they say) didnt exist. thats what you get for buying on an exchange
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:16:57
how much btc to marry ? I want IT!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:27:08
youll need both, use the phone wallet for day-to-day transaction but use your hardware wallet as you would with a bank account.
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:34:49
Try to go to a Car dealership and buy a car with your 10 "bitcoin" paper :D
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:47:59
wow government controlling the bitcoin hahaha watch a few documentary my friend because you obviously don't get why bitcoin is the future. also lookup the word DECENTRALIZED.
Remember when government wanted to shut down bittorrent? yeah exactly
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:45:28
Thats nothing, be scared when D-wave start making Quantum miners :) it will pretty much kill the whole decentralized part of the network and could potentially  render sha256 broken
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:58:57
I hope this text was google-translated because huge parts of it makes absolutely no sense.
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:52:51
    1: Entice to come by telling em energy is cheap
    2: Raise the rates
    3: Profit 
what a scam
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:30:50
Give it to me ill hodl it for you my good friend
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:59:07
Honestly if Roger had nothing to do with it I would probably dont even care. But the misinformation has to stop
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:32:55
lol Imagine this guy he wears his shirt everyday, thinks everyone seems to notice about crypto currency...
reality : omg this guy has been wearing the same tshirt for 2 weeks, eww what a bum.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:06:14
We get the confidence because we understand this technology and the potential it brings. Not only its enough to convince us but also inspires us to come up with new ways to apply this paradigm to different sphere of life. 
In a world where everything is manipulated and corrupted this new idea is giving the people of my generation hope to break free of all the B$ currently slowing this world's progression.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:14:13
well 7 days waiting to get paid a few satoshi is kinda time wasted my friend
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:11:55
Trezor supports: Btc, BCH, Eth, Etclassic, Dash thats a few on top of my head but theres more
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:44:39
I honestly almost shat my pants... I thought they actually broke the Sha256 algo and were now able to double spend or something... OOOF That would be disastrous unless we can switch algo on the fly for SHA1024 maybe lol
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:55:40
thats why I got in :P
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:41:04
4900 already :) 5K is so close I can smell it :D it smells like new money
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:33:49

@_date: 2017-09-25 14:41:47

@_date: 2018-02-09 11:31:14
worse than the scammer... is the incompetent.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:25:46
I thought the idea of crypto was to stay away from VISA and their ilk
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:14:50
you should link the pages not the fb post
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:18:23
ok so blockchain is sexist now? is it racist too ? patriarchal ? lol 
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:30:06

@_date: 2018-02-12 12:31:01
try MYBTC.ca  
JUST DONT USE COINSQUARE they are scammers and will cost you 0.0025 btc just to send crypto to your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:35:55

@_date: 2017-10-10 17:20:06

@_date: 2017-09-13 17:32:00
Excellent article, he hits on a really important factor about the money and imho crypto should solve it by being something new that might give a new wind to our whole service and goods transaction system.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:17:26
People are using this the same way hes using the fact that weeks ago fees were high. Now theyre super low and still Roger will play his endless marketing bcash tape in loop.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:03:38
Thank you very much, will spend some bitcoin profits on this. That`s how you buy good karma :D 
I have checked and they seem to accept btc :D

Dude can I borrow 10K ill give you back when we hit the moon, cool ?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:36:05
dude wtf, the first rule of Bitcoin is you don't talk about bitcoins. Especially to your wife goddamn bro
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:48:22
next time you wanna put your btc address, put the QR code instead. nobody will actually type that address
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:52:27

@_date: 2017-10-05 12:55:52

@_date: 2018-04-15 10:13:43

@_date: 2018-04-15 09:49:17

@_date: 2018-04-15 10:20:08
Wanna break BCH for good ? Make bitcoin Asic resistant
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:54:55
