My point was not about opening a debate over Friedman's book. but that being said, people either choose leftist or rightist persuasion at some point regardless of how many more events and perspectives they hear and learn about. I have settled on libertarian right spectrum for ages :) 
Inequality exists, especially in new frontiers like cryptospace. The only case of bringing down inequality successfully is through using the Scandinavian socialist model, which the countries there had adopted only after becoming rich countries in the first place, but that model is not the recipe for high growth potential. Lucky already to just stay afloat. Most other places that adopted socialist model have gone backwards / stagnant.

Then I assume you along with most other people who use USD, have read cover to cover on Milton Friedman's 'A Monetary History of the United States?' 
I don't think investors need to understand *fully* on anything, but do enough research before feeling confident enough to put money in.

My holding was in the red for the first two months hodling last year. But having looked at price history, I had never worried in the exact same way as you do now. Eventually these humps and troughs will look minuscule by 2020 halving.

lol me too but why not both? I've HODL through 10x gain and 80% loss since May 2017. never sold one sat and being called crazy by many. I couldn't care these remarks any less because I'm here for both the tech and the amount of fiat money each btc will be worth few years later. 
I believe both Bitcoin and fiat are here to stay in a similar way that bimetallism monetary standard had existed before.  spend your fiat for immediate uses, but put long-term savings into btc.

As much as being a core maximalist hodler, I am doubtful that BTC will replace fiat money any time soon. No one wanna spend money that grow 10x every year, at least not until btc price is in the maturity stage.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:09:14
HODLing since $2000 in May 2017. I was in the red for the first two months, watched it grew to 20k and crashed all the way back down, with all the bcash and regulation drama in between. Never sold even one Satoshi.

You can't say this to him, he's been fighting for BTC for so long. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:57:06
that's what I'm thinking. those guys are probably saving their money on b2x instead. bcash will never reach above 0.10 btc again 
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:23:34
As much as being a great fan of BTC, I am skeptical whether it will totally replace the status of legal tender. It is a store of value as well as informal tool of payment, but people probably wouldn't use it for formal type of payment. 
I think maturity of BTC market cap is somewhere between gold and all physical money (USD 8-31T), which implies price per BTC between 0.5-1.5 million USD by then. (with 20m coin supply)
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:00:47

It all depends when will BTC go back to the near ATH vicinity. It took slightly more than a month to easily triple from 6k on November last year, if BTC can largely recover by late 2018, I wouldn't be surprised that it shoots above 50K by end of this year.
