I really appreciate your generosity but I do still have food on my table, a roof over my head and a healthy family. There are a lot of people who could probably use it more than I as it was only a couple of bitcoins where some lost alot more. It was not my intention to solicit donations and cannot accept. Thank you Human4897 you are a shining example of what I perceive to be the bitcoin community.

Strange how on Almost Human where they regularily mention bitcoin the robot's name is Dorian.

I wish I would have found you people 2 months ago. My daughter came home from school also praising what her grade 5 computer teacher stated was the future of money. She asked me if I could buy her one so she could pay for university when the time came. as she has 4 siblings I cave in after reading a lot of positive feedback pertaining to this new type of currency. I told her that although I could not afford to buy her 1 coin i would buy each of them .5 coin and let it sit until they were ready to spend it on education. She was so excited. I search the web and being niave to storage practices back then I depositted them in the safest most secure place on the net. MTGOX. You can guess what happened from there. I have not told her what has happened as she would be crushed as I cannot afford to buy more. I will need to replenish them slowly maybe .1 at a time which will take a couple years. Now that i know what I know things will be done differently. Please when talking to children about bitcoin let them know yes it is exciting and may be the future, but there are people out there that are always trying to steal what you have.

If there is one thing I know about crimainals they cannot keep their mouths shut. Why hasn't 1 said yeah I stole some coins from Gox. Hackers like to brag don't they?

Yes although I was burned by Gox, I still believe more than ever that this is not a passing fad. If this is truly the future then I want my children and I to be a part of it.
