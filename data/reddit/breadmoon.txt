Is this worth reading -- how do I know this isn't anti-Venezuela propaganda?

I don’t suppose western foreign policy causes problems do you?

How do these things happen? There was a massive purchase below the common rate, right?

Thanks for all your posts. I'll be able to digest and make a decision with this document. I hope it helps someone else.

He's playing games. The stock market sunk as a result of his shut down shenanigans and trade wars, then when these things were lifted, anyone who invested during that time made a big return. He wants to see bitcoin lower while he gets his money together for it. You'll see. By the end of his administration he'll have a different sound bite for it.

Congrats thats not small nest egg. You can definitely turn that into a retirement. I'm the kind of guy that likes to diversify any money I run into or save over time. I'd say, grab some bitcoin to hold over the long haul using a genuine wallet, but look at gold, silver, stocks, IRA and CD accounts as well. If you're going to strike on Bitcoin do it quickly.
