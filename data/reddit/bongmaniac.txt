You don't need to overthrow fiat, fiat will overthrow itself. (eventually in ~2050).
just one little oil crisis... and a few nations abolish the dollar as petrocurrency. others follow, the demand after dollar decreases. dollar inflates ad absurdum. thus fatal feedback loop. land of the free is free again.

I am by all means not against free market per se but Fiat is literally from the devil and will push to the edge of the abyss (for about the 7^th time in history) if we don't abolish it. I understand its purpose and why it was useful for developement. But seriously, how can any minded human being aware of the exponential function possibly endorse fiat? In the 21^st Century?? It's not even about ideology, it's just math.
