Well, yea, until segwit activation..
Who the fork cares? It's an altcoin just like clams or basic attention token.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:01:50
Keep in mind, BCH is only 15x more valuable than LTC because it's syphoning value from bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:20:27
So someone with some really great posts can make a lot of money there?
How many steem per upvote? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:14:46
Since you automatically get a new address each transaction, the whole system will still take just as long while being more complicated. 
Great. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:44:44
Even tho that's true, something's can't be found out. Like, you'll never get a good estimate of how many individual people own Bitcoin by extrapolating data from the block chain. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:05:09
Maybe because you need more rep?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:29:15
We're still below $4000.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:15:01
For under 5 cents.. Oh man, good times.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:41:27
So if I have 1 bitcoin that is linked to a dozen or so addresses, and I wanna set a payment channel with 5 different friends. I just stick one of my addresses with the 5 of theirs? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:35:31
Not with bitcoin. Nothing is. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:45:59
HODL means don't sell for fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:08:01
Litecoin dipped in the hours before Segwit activation... and continued to dip afterwards. lol
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:26:40
10%. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:04:42
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:29:26
S..segwit will do nothing?
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:55:42
That's in the past?
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:01:10
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:51:24
Can you have one channel for everything you send Bitcoin to?
How do you connect other wallets to this channel, and does that process take time?
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:42:08
Did Bitcoin's difficult go down?
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:56:07
Mycelium has high fees?
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:03:41
How many per video?
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:31:04
My paper wallet doesn't give out notifications lol
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:41:32
Is this what caused monero to go up?
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:43:31
Buy from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:42:56
I kinda wanna buy an ASIC to be apart of the fun but they're all sold out :(
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:18:09
Fucking localbitcoins...
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:34:47
Thing is, I get a different wallet address everytime i receive bitcoin. So, wouldn't I need to add my new address in to a channel every single time? Same with other people's new wallet address that I'm sending to.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:31:08
I hope you didn't sell...
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:09:49
is a bunch of paid shills and eth bag holders. 
Sold all my bcash  for 0.13 btc each.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:12:03
Decentralized YouTube would be amazing. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:57:01
Too bad buying Bitcoin is still a really fucking convoluted process without a bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:20:57
How much larger than 1 mb?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:27:58
If Bitcoin goes up to $25000, you'll need maybe 90 or do bitcoin to ensure you have $50k a year. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:29:57
Yes, technically
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:59:18
I don't think this sub is for discussing Bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:54:49
Aww man, that's like in two days.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:26:21
So.... Short BCH?
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:12:25
I thought steem was another altcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:54:08
After most transactions become segwit, how many tx/s are we looking at?
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:37:25
An unknown amount? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:34:08
Will we expect fees to half? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:18:08
Since segwit txs have lower fees, I'm sure everyone will use em'
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:53:12
Check it out on testnet
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:54:51
7 BCC also
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:59:59
Shorting anytime now is dangerous af considering we've only been going up and up. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:00:21
How do we know lighting is a good enough solution? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:53:11
So when is LN coming?
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:14:30
I upgraded last night and just realized that. Why wouldn't the pin be required?? Lol
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:35:35
Wait, no! The miners need to move back in 2 hours or else the difficulty won't adjust. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:03:10
It happens automatically, right?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:29:14
I've compared the technologies and the differences between the two and made an informed decision. 
Bitcoin cash isn't sustainable since 8MB blocks will lead to the blockchain increasing in size 8x faster (more centralization), and will only lead to 56 transactions per second (20x less than Visa). You guys will eventually want even larger blocks, going for 16MB to 32MB. It's like a simple variable change is better than fixing up obsolete code. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:19:49
Any Bitcoin that's donated to him, he will sell for fiat. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:54:16
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:12:58
If it was bitcoin, it would be called Bitcoin, not Bitcoin &lt;random word&gt;. I believe there's an altcoin called Bitcoin dark? 
Regardless, looks like you're the one whose brainwashed haha.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:53:17
After most transactions become segwit, how many tx/s are we looking at?
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:56:07
They'll probably delete it because bitcoin cash is an altcoin.
It's like saying, "hey, litecoin has low fees, go check them out" here on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:27:23
It has a different ledger... Copy/pasted, but different.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:03:38
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:39:39
I don't like how nobody's answering the tx fee question 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:57:24
I have no friends but I'm sure the people around me are talking about it :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:24:10
Less or more security? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:02:08
Cool, what can you buy with BCH?
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:11:33
Why 3?
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:54:23
I do a lot of nsfw picture selling on fetlife and I always encourage people to try bitcoin as a payment method. I think I've gotten 3-4 people convinced that it's superior to services like paypal or amazon gift cards. 
I'd love to actually give back and encourage others in a different way. 
Thanks for the opportunity.
