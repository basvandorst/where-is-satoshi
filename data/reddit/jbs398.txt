Also, out of the gate there will certainly be more retail locations taking NFC/Apple Pay than Bitcoin currently has.
This should be NFC payment vs Bitcoin, not Apple Pay vs Bitcoin which is a different ballgame in terms of this chart, since NFC is not just built into the iPhone and has been around for some time on Android and other platforms.

What would you rather declare them as?  It's just classified as something you own (personal property).  Like anything else you sell that you own, if the value of what you get for it is more than what it cost it's subject to capital gains.  Why would there be some special exemption?
@_date: 2014-01-04 13:50:26
Is that the case though?  If one lost a total amount of bitcoins over a year of trading, but since the price climbed so much (especially near the end) that the amount of dollars pulled out is greater than that put in doesn't that still mean one owes capital gains?
Edit: Nevermind. I had to add some transactions manually to make it balance out.  However, it doesn't seem like you're subtracting fees at least for Mt. Gox for realized amounts.  This would inflate the capital gains taxes significantly for those who made a lot of trades throughout the year.

Is that actually the case aside from after this vulnerability was disclosed?  Code quality has definitely come up before, but from what I've observed it didn't seem like that was the top concern.
I feel like at least some of the points is making in reply to this same comment were more prominent before. Perhaps I'm wrong?
All of these other concerns aside, we've now got a really major "us" vs "them" conflict that's not going to get resolved any time soon.  In a recent debate Ver indicated he doesn't see a problem with segwit in the long run but doesn't see it as a priority.  On the other hand, explicit or implicit, BU has very little likelihood of landing segwit any time soon.  Now supporters of Core an lob criticism at BU's code quality, while BU supporters decry the mode of this exploit being exposed or exploited.
While I have more confidence in Core, I'm losing confidence that we'll have consensus on anything that moves us forward unless one side or the other has their credibility obliterated through a string of embarrassing failures that cost supporters of that side a lot.
Meanwhile we have altcoins pulling in these features that we're fighting over and incorporating benefits of all sides with far less controversy.  I understand that there's a lot on the line and that there are different ideas of what Bitcoin should be and how it should work, but if we fight until the bitter end over a sets of competing technical improvements that will never get activated due to fighting something else is going to eat Bitcoin's lunch with its own code and solutions.
@_date: 2017-04-01 01:09:58
That's arguable.  Even if that is the case, the gloating over things like the assert issue in BU really doesn't help and just adds fuel to the fire on both sides.
I'm not really sure what this feud will do to bitcoin in the long term, but it will definitely slow things down.  There were times where I recall at points int he past much of the news being about conferences, retailer support, new technologies, bitcoin-related companies, and new paradigms enabled by Bitcoin. Everyone was excited.  Now, while some of this is still present, the overall mood is really different and we're hung up on this issue.
Meanwhile, Ethereum's raiden network (like BTC's LN) is getting close to MVP, major companies are making commitments, and lots of interesting new things are coming and there's a ton more interest in other alt coins.
It's not the death of bitcoin, but this and future conflicts will shape adoption and use of bitcoin.

We're not even talking about mining here, we're talking about the equivalent of a wallet. When's the last time you spent $5,000 on a wallet, that is permanently stuck at home having to download terabytes of data, just to make transactions happen.  I'm not saying what's being suggested is impossible or entirely implausible, but just unlikely.  With where things are going people are going to want to transact using portable or mobile devices like phones.  If doing that transaction is dependent on keeping a machine running at home are you really going to want to be in a situation where you have to tell the waiter at the restaurant that your home internet connection went down, machine crashed or power went out and therefore you can't pay your bill because you can't verify that your wallet is current with the network?
I'm not making a "64kB is enough for anyone" argument here, I'm just saying that for that to be viable, other currencies (which don't require a multiple-thousand-dollar wallet), like fiat ones are going to start sounding more appealing if this is really the case.  I know that times change, but convenience and reliability are damned important and the future that's being described here has some problems given that a $20 wallet is portable, doesn't draw 300 watts and doesn't require terabytes of data to be transferred to it each month to hold value in the form of fiat currency.  Replacing that with a server is going to have to have some damned convincing logic or strong economic forces in order to get people to actually do it.
Perhaps the solution comes in the form of supernodes (banks), perhaps it comes in the form of individual parties agreeing that it's acceptable to transact with slightly higher risk without the  weight of full cryptographic verification behind each transaction (credit cards, after all, have a risk factor associated with them).  It's just that it will be fighting an uphill battle in comparison with alternatives unless those alternatives fall apart.

[Here it is](
@_date: 2011-06-21 23:05:02
It's certainly not infinitely stronger, but length makes the search space size grow very quickly. In this case, since that password is so much longer than the other, the fact that it's only alpha + spaces (26 + 1 possibilities) outweighs the other password's greater alphabet (which could be up to all 94 printable ascii + spaces as well).  One thing that is a little problematic about using english words separated by spaces is if hackers start adding this construction mechanism (valid grammatical constructions, common words, etc..) each word would then become a possible letter in an alphabet of search possibilities which is constrained by proper grammatical construction.  It's not perfect, but assuming a "dumb" search of the password space it works.
Frankly I think I somewhat prefer Steve Gibson's concept of [password padding]( (nice search space meter there as well) where one starts with a shorter password containing mixed case, digits, symbols, etc.. then pad that out with low entropy using some mechanism you choose yourself.  Under this condition an attacker will have to search a huge alphabet up to the length of the password you've padded in order to brute force it.
As a mixed alternative, instead of padding the password with repeats of a given symbol or simple patterns you could also do something like this
**S&amp;3i love protecting my bitcoin wallet**
and that would probably be even a bit better, assuming one chooses a phrase of good length.
**Edit:** Also, [LastPass]( is awesome and quite well designed from a security perspective.

They're kind of between a rock and a hard place on this one.  People will be pissed that when they bought at 0.01 USD / BTC as it flash crashed, but on the other hand they don't have a clear way of deciding which accounts where compromised and which weren't so they're rolling back the transactions.  Either way, they're going to lose a lot of faith and business both for the breach and the rollback.

Is not a formula essentially a set of mathematical rules? :-)
So maybe they're using something like cracklib ( to make sure there's enough entropy.  I'd prefer that they would post something with minimum requirements that could be followed that would always suffice like:
mixed case (at least one alpha char must differ in case from all others), at least one digit, at least one non alpha-numeric symbol, and a length of 10 or more  (or whatever)
For brute force attacks this would mean that an attacker has to search 10+ char passwords that include mixed case, digits and symbols which considerably increases the search space (well, aside from telling them they can start at 10 chars in length), but that starts with a 94 letter alphabet (printable ascii) and a search space of 2^66 (from [Wolfram Alpha](

I'm sorry, but unless more details are made available, this doesn't really hold as much water as you might like:
1) They may have salted the passwords, but at least from what I saw they used the same salt, "1" for most of the passwords, including my own :P  This is just lazy. Even salted md5 hashes aren't that great because the computational cost of computing the hash isn't horribly expensive. They should be using different hashes and multiple rounds (hell.. the concept of cryptographic difficulty should be pretty reasonable for people familiar with Bitcoin and/or Bitcoin mining)
2) Why the hell does this auditor have the credentials database on his/her machine?  This seems like a security breach in and of itself.  That should be locked down on a separate machine handling authentication and not commonly available. It shouldn't be easy to just dump all the hashes to an external networked machine, if anything as a resource it should just be handling authentication requests.
They're in a bad situation. Their security could have been better and they're pretty much doing what they have to at this point to be "fair."  I don't envy them. They're not going to be trusted after this.

Fair enough on the first two points.
On the latter point:
1. I didn't say that those had to be required (or at least didn't mean to say that), just that those would guarantee that your password would pass the test.
2. 10 char case insensitive alphabetic 141.2 trillion, digits 0-9 10 billion, case insensitive alphanumeric  3.656 quadrillion, case sensitive alphabetic,  144 quadrillion, case-sensitive alphanumeric  839 quadrillion. All those together: 9.876 × 10^17.  The full set for all printable ascii, 10 chars, according to wolfram alpha is 5.386 x 10 ^ 19.  At a guessing rate of 100 billion passwords/second it would take you 17 years, 28 days.  The set you excluded would have bought you another 3 months, 23 days. I dunno, even though that takes a fairly large number out of the pool it doesn't make that huge of a difference because we're talking about sets that grow exponentially.  And these numbers are just talking about 10 character passwords, not the set below for the total set size.  If all those were allowed you might add another 3 months or so of time to explore the full space from 1 to 9 chars as well.
3.  Presumably an attacker can legitimately sign up for an account (or many) and experimentally determine some of the rules anyways.
You do have a point, but either way it's a damn huge space to explore especially if you _started_ with 10 chars and required the alphabet be expanded with mixed case, numbers and special symbols.

This says the same thing as the video.  RBI will not itself deal with crypto or provide services for anyone enabling it.  Presumably this would be like the Federal Reserve in the US refusing to do business with banks that interact with exchanges, for example.  So.. as stated in the video, you could use cash, but exchanges in India probably can't get banking services, and, as I read it, banks themselves would presumably also not let you transfer to exchanges.
Is it banned? No.  On the other hand, does it make it difficult to operate a cryptocurrency business in India?  Sounds like it.  Does it also make it harder to exchange non-trivial amounts of local currency for cryptocurrency? Sounds like it.

Uh, washing machines are &lt;$1K even at 5 cu-ft, furnaces are probably 1 - a few K. Window unit air conditioners are like 1-200 dollars, central ones are 1K+ (just quick googling + what I can recall off the top of my head.. I haven't been in the market for any of thes recently).  So kinda, but I think the argument breaks down when you start to consider that for average use nobody has need for a 50-core machine, and that the cost of machines that provide enough horsepower for average use is well below 1K (depending on form factor and included features), why are they going to buy something with such a high computing throughput capacity? Just for Bitcoin?  Especially if they're going to have to tie up a ton of resources just to keep up with the network.  Do you run your dishwasher to keep up with your financial network? No, you run it to wash your dishes
On the other hand, if the computing model continues in the current direction where a decent amount of work can be done with GPUs and things like the general BitCoin client could support this through OpenCL which is becoming more common, that would potentially provide a lot of the capacity without going for "50-core computers".  I have no idea whether the bulk of this work could be handled in that manner, just suggesting it (and not talking about mining). I have no idea whether it would be in any way efficient to handle non-mining verification on the GPU.
Now, I think the real issue might be bandwidth rather than compute resources.  All the ISPs are starting to throw in caps right around now, which would make for sucking up a reasonably large portion of one's bandwidth each month just keeping track of transactions (even compared with things like watching video online).  If it's all to stay equally peer-to-peer and the bandwidth he's talking about is correct, caps need to disappear and bandwidth needs to increase significantly or something needs adjustment in the network (either supernodes, or changes in protocol/procedure or something else).  I don't think it's impossible to solve or overcome, but if his calculations are correct, these are issues that need to be addressed somehow.
@_date: 2011-06-22 18:07:19
Personally, my solution for all of this would be to use one rather strong password on LastPass and then use generated passwords for every other site.  Yes, there's some irritation to have to open the LastPass app on my phone to copy the password to the clipboard and paste it into apps to log in, but frankly I prefer that to the other password vaults out there for the single reason that: LastPass pretty much runs _everywhere_.  They have desktop apps, Phone apps, plugins for every major browser, and if all else fails bookmarklets that can be used in place of plugins (which work for browsers on the phone).  It's all encrypted client-side, so any attacker that gains access to their database just gets individually encrypted blobs that they would have to brute force, LastPass _cannot_ decrypt your data.  In addition, post recent traffic irregularities they saw they've changed the way their hashing works to be even more painful to brute force by [switching]( to SHA-256 with 256-bit salts using 100,000 rounds (complete overkill :-)
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:58:08
Fair. I’ll admit I had a bit of a knee-jerk response to a comment painting what bitcoin is now primarily in terms of what Satoshi said its goals were. I don’t deny that was the hope and that it has had (mixed, albeit mainly due to governments overreacting, all the things that have gone on with fees, and other ease of use factors) success in bringing that.
I don’t think there’s anything wrong with selling some for a profit. While it might be secondary it has brought more interest to it. Personally I don’t really care why people are drawn in if it keeps building a larger user base and use cases. Heck, the broader crypto space is now starting to have effects on the semiconductor and GPU industries to the point that they’re citing them in their earnings calls and designing related products. The more this happens, the more it’s a given, the more it is a normal, accepted thing, the better.  Instead of the press taking about dark web using it for drugs primarily, it’s just another part of the financial ecosystem that isn’t going anywhere.
Additionally, I sold a bunch of eth last year for an Africa Twin, don’t regret it one bit :-). At the time, selling gave me some freedom since everything was fluctuating so wildly. Frankly, though I’d love to have more profits from some crypto, I’d also like to see it get to be boring so it can be used more as a value transfer system and people can be less worried about how much their assets have fluctuated in value overnight.
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:24:38
It doesn’t care about making people free either. Bitcoin doesn’t want anything except for participants in the network to follow the rules. That is only enforced because enough people agree on those rules. Asserting anything further is ascribing motivations to the network participants that may or may not be true.
Also, the rules, which limit supply are inherently deflationary in a situation where more and more people value it. It may not want thanks, but it’s behaving as expected.
Additionally, motorcycles are colloquially referred to as “freedom machines”.

OK, The concept is hypothetical at this point anyways, and no technical details of how an implementation of a supernode would work have been established. So, complaining that it's "completely dishonest" is ridiculous, especially without going through the implications delegated authority like this.
Presumably, though, it is not a wallet that holds your funds, but it is a centralized control point that acts as a gatekeeper that is essential for performing transactions. So, can an individual supernode freeze your account? No, but it can refuse to perform transactions for you.  Would there be other supernodes that you could run your transaction through? Most likely, but if resource costs are high enough there might be few enough of them where refusals could matter. Also, a bank doesn't have to  have "all your data" it just has some amount of your funds and some identity data about you that they can use to uniquely identify you.  On the other hand, if we're delegating authenticating the torrent of transactions to supernodes, they end up having, like all participants do currently, a record of all transactions that have been performed by you and everyone else, so actually they have a heck of a lot more information than an individual bank would.
Sure, at least under one hypothetical implementation they are not necessarily the equivalent of a vault, but banks aren't just a vault either, they're financial intermediaries to whom we delegate authority or must get authority from to perform transactions.  This is what a supernode would be doing.  You would be dependent on these nodes being up to date in order for your local wallet to be able to be able to know how much funds were available as a result of all previous transactions.  Bank might not be the ideal word, but they would be strong concentrations of authority, and you would really want to make sure that there were plenty of them around so that they can't individually or in small groups prevent the flow of transactions.

Yes, and they [typically do great with that]( Arbitrage opportunities exist for those who happened to have the timing, resources, or "foresight" to put assets in places they can be leveraged.  Technicals are pure fortune telling bullshit for the most part. Fundamentals are useful priors, but also not always predictive. News is a timing game that everyone plays (hence all the high-speed trading links between Chicago and NYC).
People figure out tricks that others haven't observed but those opportunities don't last forever and eventually everyone ends up playing the same game grinding the benefits down toward the level of costs.
No clue on this as far as real stats but I wouldn't be surprised that the vast majority of wealth increase bitcoin holders/users have realized hasn't been through skillful trading and rather through just holding dollar cost averaging.
Someone can try and correct me if I'm wrong but "pros" aren't magical oracles that generally beat the market in the long term (without insider advantages that might lead to legal troubles).

I'm not sure that everyone using the same software would necessarily be a good thing.  If all them are using the same data and algorithm and suddenly all decide to sell, you can guess what's going to happen.  I think some variety of approaches is probably the most stable with nobody individually holding or trading so much that it makes a single actor one that can swing the market around.

To some extent they do, but it's dependent on how algorithms model the market and respond.  You can probably attribute flash crashes like [the one from 2010]( to algorithmic trading.
Edit: One of the things that _is_ different about bitcoin is that the barrier to entry to participate is practically zero, it's exactly what you want to put on the line so you don't have to even have a minimum of thousands of dollars to get in, you can experiment with $5 of bitcoin.

Yeah, note that: "used his computer time"
These are shared machines that _lots_ of people are using for granted periods of time.  Not to mention that most of them are based around CPUs that are geared towards being able to do 64-bit floating point operations quickly and they're not GPUs (which aren't yet that heavily used because they tend not to have tons of 64-bit FP units).  SHA256 is integer and doesn't run that fast on CPUs.  I'm pretty sure it'll be a losing energy cost proposition even on supercomputers.
It might have been worth it before GPU clients came out, but you're not going to be raking in that many coins on a supercomputer unless its a GPU cluster that's running AMD cards (and I think nVIDIA tends to be more common in these applications so far (Tesla cards)).

From the latest update description for how to do this it sounds like rate limiting wouldn't help that much except to space out these types of things since you could build up your 100 orders over minutes/hours and all it takes it adding/cancelling 1 order to get the engine to start doing things with the previously added 100.
~~It sort of sounds like this is related to the creation/deletion of price slots in the order book.~~ Actually it just sounds like adding/removing orders from the book is expensive, whether the slot exists or not.

Even though they haven't demonstrated volume, as these things trickle out they _are_ going to influence the overall hashrate since they're an order of magnitude or two faster than using GPUs and they're quite a bit cheaper than Avalon's products, speaking of which how many of those are there out there and how long will it take for even small quantities of BFL's orders to make a difference in the network hashrate?.

I have no economics training as a background, but I'd imagine the one thing one might expect to be able to compare it to in the long run are precious metals or any finite resource that can eventually be exhausted or becomes prohibitively expensive to get.  Sure there are differences in that resources often  have inherent utility to them as well, and bitcoins are entirely virtual.
What are the reasons that we don't currently use precious metals for regular transactions?  For one at current value it's hard to divide them up into small enough units for small transactions. This isn't a problem for bitcoins.  Is their deflationary behavior the problem though?  Certainly deflation encourages people to hold on to currency rather than spend it, but would some stability to that _rate_ of deflation make that less of a problem?  I don't know if there's any precedent there.

Well, it's a plotting library for Python. By itself there are plenty of things that if you're familiar with the R language would be easier and more terse to do with R.  On the other hand, if you include all of Python, you have a really broad tool set for doing a lot of things (including in the [numerical/scientific realm]( ) with a language that's not too bad either.  That said, I'm sure there are things that R does really well that corresponding Python libraries might not do particularly well (or the Python libraries might be a PITA to install).

I wouldn't be surprised if this is essentially what happens regularly with any emerging technology or market.  Did the first banks that put themselves online have all their ducks lined up and offer bulletproof services?  Sure they might have had existing knowledge to draw on in the organization to have enough sense to use decimal numbers or integers for currency (or they just had existing internal systems that they hooked into that already had that), but was their network security perfect, were they designed to scale effectively or efficiently?
There's certainly a lot to be said for forethought, but best practices require either a lot of intelligence (and an ability to think through all the places where something might go wrong) or experience to deal with beforehand.  And for all the public failures, imagine how many screw-ups are just smoothed over internally?
Do organizations or businesses that survive get better at these things over time? If they have competition and stay in business, yes. Is anything that anyone shoves out the door perfect? Never.  You just hope that when you do business with them that they had foresight or experience to avoid catastrophic failure or they have enough resources to make it right when they do screw up.

Exactly, look at how many pools there are out there that continue operations that have [single digit percentages]( of the hashrate plus the whole "Unknown" category.

... that have fairly well tested and perhaps conservative algorithms.
I've lost and gained a bit in the past few weeks (overall haven't lost money invested because the coins are from mining a few years ago), some was trading myself, some was with repeated adjustments to technical heuristics in a bot where it made stupid trades.
At the moment I would be better off had I forgotten I had some bitcoin in a wallet and just discovered them today, but it's entertaining.

Yep, there are a couple of interfaces.  There's at least one for the other direction too.
That said, I'm more familiar with Python these days and I'm finding the [pandas]( module which OP used fairly useful for working with timeseries data.

There are other alternative cryptocurrencies that people have put together (which are essentially Bitcoin with some changes).  One of them is [PPCoin]( (pdf), which does have a different model for controlling ongoing supply.  I haven't thought about the details much, but I believe it's supposed to target 1% inflation per year eventually. [Some short descriptions in the FAQ](
[Some of the other ones]( have some different models as well, but most just play with the total supply and the timescale.

I think they know about this and have known about this.  This is the first time, however, that I've seen someone post a recipe for it.
The [press release]( they made back in early April was to make one version of this slightly harder.  I think they've also implemented some order rate limits at some times.  The problem with this is the order rate doesn't matter, people could build up 100 or more orders on an account over minutes/hours then trigger it with 1 order.

I assume this is basically abstracting away usual interactions with the other exchanges so crypto.st basically has one or a few accounts with each one that it uses for all this trading?
Is this actually in line with the TOSs for the existing exchanges? Or do you have a special relationship with the exchanges?

The main response to this would be (ills or not of legislation aside). Uh, the licenses for none of this software precludes its use for purposes the author doesn't like.  How are there any values encoded in it other than, please use this, credit us but don't sue us, and if it's the GPL please include the code if you redistribute it.
Also, how is this new, even if they end up concluding that it's neutral that the NSA is contributing to this.  Where do you think a lot of SELinux [came from](
And I really wouldn't be surprised if some of the [DoD use of open source]( has been used for warfare.

Exchanging it for bank debt?  Can you elaborate?
To my understanding you'd have to have either the fiat or bitcoin in reserve make this work on an ongoing basis.  It's not a credit card/loan, unless I'm missing something.
One of the things that is currently not well supported is subscription payments, which a lot of businesses will want in order to switch to bitcoin. Personally I'd rather have a common service (be it local or in the cloud) where a reserve of resources could be placed and have those stream out on a schedule in a reliable manner.  Meanwhile this would seem to put a bit more control in the hands of the user where individual subscriptions could be added/canceled unlike signing up with a credit card which unless it's a single-use number puts you at their behest and/or going through chargeback to cancel a subscription.
In addition it makes for a convenient way to buy in on a regular basis.

Right, there's predetermined rate of generation that doesn't care about the demand for them.  There is no "target" for inflation or deflation, nobody can say "print more" or "print less" in response.  As long as interest in it keeps growing, one can probably expect it to continue to deflate.
Which does have an interesting effect of encouraging people to hold onto currency already in their wallets instead of buying/selling.  Or for people to hold onto the bitcoins they've got and only buy/sell with funds just recently exchanged from other currencies.

This is true.  I was going to say that the total monetary base for USD might be more stable in certain respects since we have less seasonality in good sales, but if I'm looking at the right thing, it looks like that might have been the case from around the mid 80s to around 2008, but it's [spiked quite a bit since then]( but then it [depends on what you're measuring](
On the mining point, there is another way to look at that.  The overall supply rate is based on a pre-defined curve for supply vs time, but an individual can take in a larger percentage of that output rate relative to other miners by adding ASICs or GPUs more quickly.  So, people can exchange bitcoins for more hardware and mine relatively more bitcoin than others.. that is until they either are all gone or hardware/energy costs make it not worth it.  The evaporation of the supply is definitely on a very much shorter timescale than precious metals or other natural resources. And the rate/quantity of this is known whereas technological changes and modeling can change the availability and cost of getting new physical resources (Oil is a good example of this where deep water drilling and tar sands sources have become economically/technically feasible).

I find that really odd since from appearances they will let you buy cards in the app with a credit card.  Why would there be a problem with allowing bitcoins in addition to credit cards?  Perhaps they provide a cut to apple for the gift cards, but couldn't do so for the bitcoin transactions (or at least to the same degree?).
Anyways.. lame :-P  Maybe they could allow purchasing of the cards through their website?

Quick question on this front: Do _any_ of the existing exchanges publicly indicate anything about their DDoS protection?  I don't mean the bits and pieces that people have intuited by noticing headers or that their requests are proxied in some way.
I ask because, if they don't, there's a lot less leverage to get other exchanges to share this info.  Although personally, I'd be more concerned with an exchange's ability be internally stable and consistent, i.e.: following [ACID]( And also security procedures, like using second factor auth.

John Hunter who created the project was a quant so it makes sense for it to be quite useful for plotting financial data.
Speaking of which, I wonder if his [memorial fund]( could take BTC?
Edit: matplotlib also kicks MATLAB's 2-D plotting to the curb.

Um, I dunno about that.  I think that "smoking gun" indicates that they filled that form out incorrectly:


I dunno, but it'd have to be some fine parsing of that to insist that they  don't act as a currency exchange OR send funds based on customers' instructions.
I'd guess that perhaps the US-based part of the company might not be considered to act as an exchange, but how could they then argue that they're not sending funds based on customer instructions?  Because they're the same company with different divisions in the US and Japan?
I don't think those original things that they filled out documents on have anything in themselves to do with the "clarifying" document (since they were already potentially doing things that that should have said yes to on that form), however the release of that might have nudged this seizure forward.

I think a lot of us have had pretty much the same experience.
If you want to read up on using technicals for trading, which I've started doing there's [babypips]( and [investopedia](
Be prepared to lose more though.  No clue if I'd ever get good at this, would never pursue it as a "job" but I'd be happy if I figure out how to get a trading bot to make small consistent gains that I could just leave running :-)

Admittedly I've never run a conference, but this would seem to be one reason why one would:
1) Record projector feeds (which for example the Next Day Video guys have done for [PyCon a few years back and some other conferences]( (disclosure: I've gotten a ride home from one of the guys who runs this and watched some of their recordings)
2) Get slides from presenters beforehand.

"Electrum also allows you to import addresses (and their private keys of course) from external sources, e.g. from another Bitcoin client's wallet"
Looks like it, though I've never tried it:
To add to this: 
Actually, I just tried this and it worked.  The one caveat is that it won't be able to regenerate the imported keys from the brainwallet so you'll still need to keep a backup of them separately.
