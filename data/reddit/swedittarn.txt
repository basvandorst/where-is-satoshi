no you are just dumb. You pay a fee everytime you transfer money, the question is if the bank shows how much you pay.

1) Keep injecting newly printed money into the ponzi to keep it afloat
2) stop injecting new money into the ponzi causing it to collapse

This ^
how is this not the obvious solution? what moron decided to force people into registrering at coinbase to get a refund? wtf?


use your brain next time and do whats obvious and ask for a refund address? wtf? are you serious? At least now I know that I will never ever use coinbase.. if you miss something like this it makes you wonder what other obvious shit have you fucked up?
I apologize for the language but I cannot believe my eyes, is this real life? does coinbase not know better than the average user? thats..  not very reassuring.

The Murican armys job is to keep the US dollar as the world reserve currency. If that ends, the ponzi may start to fall apart.

Buying access to the same article on the web = not supporting journalism.
Can you explain? because that is the part I don't understand.

I dont understand.
Aren't news articles published on the web written by journalists to begin with?
How is buying a piece of paper = supporting journalism?
Buying access to the same article on the web = not supporting journalism? [edited for clarification]
Is the joke about "everything on the internet should be free"? because I think that is something that bitcoin can help address.
