No reason why they should not. If this was a scam they would not offer a chance to get coins out and let people rush out like this.

70% of people have not heard of bitcoin or think it is something it isn't, the best way for them to learn is to try to buy something with 10$ worth to start with. 
Also bitcoin address use is at an all time high.

Who else will develop the protocol, will you fill the role and offer suggestions or are you just venting what you see as corporate interests when the fact is decentralization is hard and centralized easy to use stuff that grandma can use will always have its hand in the cookie jar.
Look at facebook vs freenet.

Get 1000 BTC buy something for 50USD buy 50USD that same day you spend it. You are back to 1000BTC and the price can go up or down tomorrow and it will not effect the cost of your item.

They won't think of using bitcoin until the price is STABLE. If it is stable at 10 dollars a coin it will still be the same level of success as 10,000.
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:20:04
Just use it as a currency and rebuy what you spend the price does not matter.
