Our team is attempting to change the game with [Blockchain Poker](
We expect to be out of alpha by the end of Q1.

[We]( have had users receive warnings from Coinbase on this. We definitely don't recommend depositing directly from Coinbase to *any* gambling site.

BCH currently provides a better user experience for players. It's as simple as that.
LN needs more time to mature before we'd be willing to support it. We need something that's fast, cheap, and reliable. LN does a good job on the first 2 but still struggles on the last one.
These problems don't exist on other versions of Bitcoin.

We're completely agnostic but whichever network provides the best experience for players is going to be what we recommend people use.

No actually we only have a web version but it works well on most modern phones (still making improvements to make it even better).
You can get rid of the address bar by adding it to your phone's home screen.
If you thought it worked well before, it's much faster now as the team has been focusing on scaling as MTTs are being rolled out.

Don't let your personal investments prevent you from seeing the irony of that statement.
If you don't like it, perhaps you can help by contributing to [Bitcoin Core](
Seriously, give both a try. You might be surprised at what you'll find.

It's good to keep in mind that you may not have the full picture when it comes to both the current state and the history of each project.
We communicate with the development teams of each project regularly so we know where each is heading.
We're hopeful that L2 technology can get Bitcoin to a state where it can do well on the usability side even with a throttled base layer but that's on LL and the rest of the lnd team to make that happen.

LN needs more time to mature. There are better (and safer) ways to offer instant low-fee transactions which we've supported for over a year now.

At low volume, the issues are manageable. System-level problems are, however, amplified at scale.
Each of those services, for example, is simply a proof of concept built to showcase the LN's utility.
Our goals happen to be different and therefore require networks, tools, and services that operate at a different caliber.

Glad you like [it]( We've been working hard on it since 2015, currently in the process of rolling out support for tournaments.

You would have to provide us with the hand ID to get a breakdown. Rake is 0.0%-2.5% at 250/500.
You had either split the pot with somebody else, didn't have as much equity as somebody else in the pot, etc.

You can contact the support team by using the in-app feedback form within the menu (top right), just be sure to include your email so they can get back to you.
I'm sure they'll be able to find the hand for you.

We've acutely familiar with the state of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The team has been involved in the space for a very long time.

There's a few things we're doing to drop the barrier of entry:
 - No registrations.
 - Free bitcoin (via faucet).
Also keep in mind that sites like Nitrogen have higher operating costs so rake is always going to be higher.
You can get a sense of what we've been up to on our subreddit: @_date: 2017-04-04 01:16:56
Just a heads up that Blockchain Poker entered beta last month.

Give [this]( a try.
Other sites require you to sign up (at least giving away your email). [Blockchain Poker]( doesn't.
