We were told SegWit would be here in April--before the halving.  It's not here.  The halving is coming and everyone is afraid of this:    
This is about trust.  That is why Ethereum is rising.  Bitcoin has lost trust.  How much will it lose?

Why is this not a horrible, horrible thing?  I don't understand what is going on here but I read this little bit:


Won't this pretty much end the way bitpay does business for instance?   Also, this waiting on bitcoin really sucks ass from my perspective (the dumb end user).  I wanted to buy some Ether(first time) the other day so I transferred bitcoin to poloniex.com, traded and transferred eth back.  The eth moved quick as hell.  The bitcoin was like waiting on a damn bank again.  
I just don't get this if the point is to slow down transactions.  If this slows down transactions while lightning speeds them up, shouldn't lightning get put in place before this?
Now I use electrum which is totally awesome and you really see how it sucks for ethereum not to have something like that but this sounds like a huge step back for bitcoin to me--at least without lightning.

Does electrum manage this for you?

That's not what was said at all.  Pretend all you like though.

Sorry, the technology is way above my head.  I thought BitPay relied on being able to reliably determine whether a transaction was valid or not a double spend before a confirmation.  If this will cause people to wait until after a confirmation, that sounds like a problem.    
Thanks
