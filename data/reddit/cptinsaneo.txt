Oh okay, I read that totally differently--my bad. That's great.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:23:18
I wouldn't. You're already divorced.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:21:00
Probably this. Buy bitcoin, tell no one except your S/O.

I guess it depends on your relationship. But yeah I mean if your wife is annoying then don't tell her, haha. But I wouldn't lump my/our savings into it unless I'm trying to get divorced and lose half my assets anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:22:01
Basically, yeah.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:55:33
Yeah that's pretty much it. I don't really talk about it with anyone, but granted I'm not heavily invested.

Wanna get married?
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:03:35
I just do that all the time to everyone about bitcoin.

Don't invest/covert what your can't afford to lose in USD. If you use btc as a get rich quick plan then you're in for some heartbreak. Let it ride, or convert back to USD and save yourself time, stress, and whatever else you're missing out on because of btc.

I'm a ling term btc hodler, but I don't really pay attention.. What are these physical wallets, how are they better?
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:21:22
Hodl is my middle name.

The key is to not tell anyone.

Too bad Twitter can't turn a profit.

Since you care enough to comment-- it was a very quick implication that I'm distrustful of a social media platform founder's opinion of crypto currency when it took 11 years for his company to turn a profit (not even sure how much). But IDC, not being skeptical is dumb imo, and I'm not trying to argue about dumb shit.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:47:26
Yep. That's me.
@_date: 2018-03-22 05:45:42
Took 11 years but here we are! I love twitter btw. My only social media platform I browse other than reddit..
