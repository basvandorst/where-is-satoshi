I'm in the same goddamn boat buddy and I've been trying to get help for days. I'm completly lost. Does it atleast go back into your wallet if it sits in limbo? I hope somebody helps lol.

0.0000452 BTC

Sorry for my ignorance but how can I check if my TX is RBF enabled?

I'm at work now doing intensive research on the matter so sorry I haven't answered in awhile. 
Long story short I don't know anything about bitcoins other than I got some on a whim back in 2011 after a friend talked me into it. I saved it into a bitcoin core wallet,encrypted it and as they say here hodl for 6 years. I got a debt that I need to pay so I figured I'd cash out some bitcoins to pay my current debts and hodl the others hoping it takes me to the moon.
So 2 days ago I found my old computer backed up my old bit core wallet to a thumb drive. I went to bitcoin.org and downloaded what I'm assuming is the newest version of bitcoin core( I think 0.15 something not sure I'm at work). I then put my old .Dat file into it and viola I had my old wallet on my new computer.
Since I made my purchase back in the day I saw my balance pop up relatively quick. As soon as my coins popped up I attempted to send some of them to coinbase to cash out using the default TX fee.  That was 48 hours ago and my transaction on coinbase is still pending which sucks bc I want to cash out now. After looking into it for awhile I think my TX is stuck and it's bc the default fee was to low as you helped me find out.
Could it be bc my bitcoin core isn't fully synced yet? Or is it stuck bc of the fee? If it's the latter does bitcore have the option to resend with a higher fee? Do I have to wait until it's fully synced for it to process? 
Again sorry for all the questions but I really appreciate the help. Shit at this point I'm willing to throw some bitcoin to somebody who helps me get this resolved bc I feel alone.

Transaction size is 225 bytes.
I will mention my computer wallet is still synching. About 2 years worth of synching left. Would that play a factor as to why it's been 48 hours and it's still pending? Or is it coinbase just being super slow? 
Thanks for answering by the way.

I'm not going to lie like most people. I'm solely in it just to get rich while simultaneously diversifying my bonds nigga

Regular currency such as US Dollar, English pound, Japanese yen, etc.
People here are from different parts of the world so fiat covers everything instead of saying dollar and maybe confusing folks

I got a few way back in the day in 2011 and just held till now.
I got debts that I really needed to pay so I sold half to pay debts while hodl the other half to see where it goes. If it crashes I win, if it goes up I win. 
I also sold some bitcoin to buy lite coins at 60 bucks. Same thing selling half and holding half.

I'm at work now away from my computer but when I get home I'll out the I'd in here.

I'm brand new to this as well so I can give you a noobs perspective as I see it.
Coinbase is like a bank but in this case it's for bitcoin and not fiat. That's where you can buy,sell bitcoin,lite coin, etc and convert BTC to fiat and vice versa.
Wallets are like they sound with real money. It's a wallet that you keep your money in with fiat but In  this case it's where you keep your BTC on your persons. 
You can keep your BTC on coinbase but think of it like a bank can get robbed and your money stolen but if you have it in your wallet as long as you protect it, it can't be stolen from you.
Don't make the mistakes I made if you make a transaction please please please if you take anything away from me remember to pay a sufficient mining fee (400sat/b). Low fees will cause you transaction to become stuck or pending for seemingly forever where if you pay the fee you'll see your transaction processed in an hour or so. Unfortunately for me I have 2 stuck transactions with significant amount of bitcoins.
Hope this helps

Don't have the ID with me I'm at work. But somebody said earlier I'm sitting at 20 sat bite for a fee. Does that mean I'm fucked? How can I expire it? Can I? Options
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:35:25
I should also mention that when I click on the coinbase transaction details tab now it's now saying that my transaction hash can no longer be found whereas before it just kept saying 0 out of 6 confirms and 88% confidence,etc. Hopefully this helps

Not that exactly but I got something similar.
 After trying to synch a bank account twice it said that my customer name was to short? No idea what that meant 
 After the second attempt it said I tried to synch to many times and to try again in 24 hrs. WTF I just want to buy some coin Jesus christ the hoops you have to jump to even get an account setup.
