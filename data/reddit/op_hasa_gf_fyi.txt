Dude I did a remind me in one year on btc when it was $600. You don't want that painful of a PM, trust me.

Another 300x it's current price and it's larger than all world currencies combined. There is some kind of ceiling to this. We're not going to double the wealth in the world with the invention of Bitcoin.

Perfect reason to invest more in eth.

That's a good analogy. Hopefully we can have a lot of different coins be successful, it doesn't have to just be one winner.

I can't claim to know enough to agree or disagree with you, but if what you say is true it makes me wonder what you know that all those eth developers and corporations don't. Are there more cases or wrong moves locking up eth than btc? Are there any more forks in eth than there have been in btc?

It has so much more going for it than btc. Tons of huge corporations and governments actively using eth and building new dapps on eth. It does everything btc does and more. Only a matter of time till people start figuring it out.

Sorry to reply to a month old thread, but can you clarify one thing thats still unclear to me after reading your comment.
I buy at $1000, sell at $1100, see a $100 gain. I later buy at $1100, sell at $1000, for a $100 loss, and net profit of 0. I understand I won't owe capital gains tax, as I didn't gain anything, but... 
 
When you say you have to account for each trade, do you mean outside of that grand total (Which may be positive or negative) you have to pay some other tax on every profitable trade you made? In the above example would you owe taxes on $100? If you repeated this 0 sum trade 1000 times, would you owe taxes on $100000?

Thanks for the reply. I've done *a lot* of trading but only have a small profit overall. If I had to pay a tax on every profitable trade I've made it would bankrupt me a few times over.
