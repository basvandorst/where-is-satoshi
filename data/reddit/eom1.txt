Shouldn't the freebie coins we got from all the forks be part of bitcoin's market cap?

Are they accepting LN?

How will this work: Bitcoin fees are too high. It would have to be that everybody opens a LN channel with Amazon. But how much money should we fund this channel with. To open and close the channel should cost approx $60. I would amortize that value over the number of transactions I plan to make with them. So if I am willing to pay 1 dollar transaction fee it would be 60 transactions.
And if the average $ that I spend an Amazon is 20 dollars. I should fund this channel with 60 x 20 dollars or $ 1,200 dollars.
The only problem is if Amazon closes the channel before all the money is spent, then my transaction cost might be more than 1 dollar.

Do they accept lightning?

Miners are making a lot of money mining TX fees. Sometimes even 10 BTC per block (when blockchain is busy). If you raise the block size limit, transaction fees go down substantially, causing some miners not to be profitable. And they made substantial investments for the network. So increasing block size is propably not going to happen.

They still don't support segwit
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:52:24
Because Bcash has short addresses.

How much money is this attack costing the spammers?

If bitcoin is worth 1 million, I would be happy to pay a transaction fee of 5,000 dollars

Words change with time. People give words meaning by using them.

Same with the dollar. Some people have billions and some have five cents. Everybody can have some.

They do own over 100,000 BCH. Eventually they will add it on Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:38:06
Should have used segwit.

Pity the pour soul who would have taken a loan in bitcoin this past few years
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:46:32
This ^
And when friends and family want to send the bitcoins, LN should be ready and will be much cheaper fees.

It's missing the word "Cash" after Bitcoin.

Bloom filters?

He was too smart for his own good. Better be dumb and just run the software. That was 2008!!.

Careful with the Fork because you could end up with more chains
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:01:10
I have a feeling she hates soft forks.
