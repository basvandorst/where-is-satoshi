Coinbase is fine.  It's not like you're selling your soul to them just to exchange some fiat for BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:33:21
It's completely ridiculous how they can squat on  and r/btc.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:12:36
What is VET?
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:37:36
What a weird spectacle.
Also pole vaulting.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:46:41
That's gotta be some sort of record.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:37:22
It's very well thought out, agreed.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:25:41
Chapeau to the pyramid step sell wall @ $15100 on GDAX.
It's a thing of beauty.
I want to walk up it like Q-bert

Whale bots generally buy and sell every coin in the top 50.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:48:26
I mostly agree but saying "never" is foolishly bull-headed.
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:23:24
I think the whale thing is more autonomous than most people think.  Reason being is that their bots have the ability to go into sell-only mode under certain market conditions, which will drop prices across the board without any actual whale interventions.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:29:03
The question is simple enough and doesn't warrant a whataboutism.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:33:37
Ah, but each variable has a different weight.
The whale variable for instance.

I call it "dark flow" and it must be respected.

Binance or Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:57:05
A decent of thumb is you shouldn't need any of this money in less than six months at any given situation you find yourself in.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:41:06
But not so common/useful as bitcoin.

Believe everything you read on twitter.

When things get tough, the tough raise the price back up with limit orders while pocketing a little profit.

@_date: 2017-12-23 23:11:27
A lot people hate on bitcoin automatically since they have no money to invest.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:16:42
All these alt coins have pretty much killed all the institutional momentum going into crypto.  I'm surprised it's not being mentioned more.
Coinbase had things perfect with the three coins being offered.  It's not a coincidence that the best parabolic gains were during this time period.  Now that they're offering "Bitcoin Cash" new people won't know what hell is going on and it shows with the massive slump going on.
Three is a crowd (good), four is a party (bad).
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:35:54
True but most people know that if you panic sell for a loss then you've sealed losing money, and it's best to hold.
Hence the invest responsibly campaign to prevent nervous money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:15:25
It's still way under the ATH, you'll have lost a little profit but peace of mind knowing it's fully back on the up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:43:45
Also the height is way too antisocial.  Blocking everyone's view behind you so you can have a "commanding view" if such a dick move.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:43:02
Why doesn't the UN or whoever do something about all these paid shill farms?  It's objectively evil, completely invalid, and affects everyone's day to day lives on the internet.

Unfortunately they're almost all backordered on Amazon.

Seems like a tax nightmare too.

We're in the wrong business!
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:13:30
Retarded hindsight comment and typical illiterate moron use of ellipses.  Checks out.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:43:15
Hopefully all this ridiculous civil war bullshit doesn't effect these kinds of institutional gains.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:13:18
Right, it's especially bad with people that have money tied up in other things like a new house or business.  They have an excruciating mental tug of war of whether they should sell that and buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:57:54
The whales will just sit on them.

I don't think any of us are in it just to 2x our wad.  This is at least 3x worth due to all FUD.

Gemini, although they tend to have stricter deposit limits.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:01:50
Typo, those are 2016 prices in the 2013 screenshot.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:27:35
I had to buy, such a historic and probably extremely profitable dip.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:21:24
Note, this only applies for 2018 and onwards.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:21:37
It should be noted that your marginal tax rate is going down.  So a lot of investors will be better off.
This just closes a loophole.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:32:15
No fee for limit orders.  Tiny fee for market orders.

Wallets are roughly equivalent to a safe-deposit box at the bank or a safe at home.
You keep your long-term coinage there, leaving the smaller stuff you might want to trade at home (the exchange).
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:00:22
Welp I was wrong, now sounds like it's for a new identity platform using the Bitcoin core blockchain.

1. Bots buy up the coin
2. McAfee announces on Twitter about the coin
3. People buy it FOMO'ing

Yep, Litecoin is silver to Bitcoin's gold.

No, with gambling you can't win unless you play more. With crypto you can win by doing nothing.

The 2014 "crash" was barely a blip in the S&amp;P 500.  Do you mean 2008?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:40:07
The FUD'sters cherry pick this like it's gospel.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:45:49
Dollar cost average it over time.  It's emotionally worse to be unlocky than the gains for being lucky.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:02:57
Gemini lets you make a bank deposit and instantly put that money into a coin, locking in the price.  You'll need to wait a few days before you can withdraw it however.
Coinbase too.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:29:16
Looks good, but might want to diversify a bit more by opening up a Bittrex or Binance account and get some more coins you like in the top 10 in market cap.  Wouldn't pull that from your current four though, those are the most important.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:07:01
I agree overall and am hodling myself but the key to understand is that money has no past, only a present and a future.
It doesn't matter how much profit you made, all that matters is what you're holding now and what it can be in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:57:50
Dark flow.
The dip goes double or triple if people haven't been doing their sacrifices at the alter.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:44:26
Seriously, just keep it coinbase and worry about transferring later.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:33:34
GDAX needs a chat box.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:02:29
Anyone exchanges with very advanced limit/stop order settings?  I'm talking like specifying the falling vs. rising edge and debouncing/smoothing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:19
I think that's the more accurate price all along.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:29:57
In order for it to ever be at 99% we'd be in the middle of some sort of mass extinction event.  Even then, the last thing you'd care about is cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:41:01
What a pathetic dip, disgraceful.
We need better dips than this!
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:01:41
Nah dude, for $70 just keep it on the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:10:18
Shouldn't be putting your rent money into crypto.

Better to make 1000 millionaires than one billionaire, which is how things seem to be heading thankfully.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:34:10
It'd be interesting to compare the walls to the impromptu market orders by casual investors.  Not sure which is heavier in terms of volume.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:52:45
Watch the buy wall for BCH on GDAX.  Someone keeps putting up a big order then canceling it right before it hits.

@_date: 2017-12-18 19:29:36
There were bigger sells walls last week, one of which was 1000 coins at $19250.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:03:33
Grammar is for loosers
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:38:31
Except they're much more likely to find an asteroid or underground deposit full of gold rather than bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:35:36
It always has to be lower than the last price to be a buy wall.  But for a non-flippant answer then it means the price will go up after it hits, how much depends on how big the wall is!
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:03:56
Yeah, Coinbase and Gemini lets you deposit directly into coinage.  No waiting while the price goes up.

Guessing he means Microsoft will be involved in a new exchange app that will rival Coinbase *and* only offer decentralized coins, not Bcash.

He's just a nasty bigot. It's fine to shorten common words for casual discourse and he probably doesn't shit himself unless it meets a certain biased criteria.
