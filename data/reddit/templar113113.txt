Get a segwit address mate
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:53:17
You could go to BTC ATMs if you re living near a big city there is probably already a few, I ve never tried but I guess you don't need to ID yourself to buy BTC.
Those ID requirement are only rules made by exchanges,nothing to do with the cryptos. 
Good luck mate

Bth is working fine because it doesn't have to scale like btc does.  Its like saying car 1 works better than car 2 without mentioning that car 2 has to pull a trailer with 500 people in it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:53:17
I think its because if you send from non segwit to segwit address there is still the fees.  But then segwit to segwit should be fine.

Nailed it mate :)

If you wanna know a lot more about bitcoin :
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:34:11
Yet... check well in case it jumps back or you ll hate yourself. I did the mistake of not HODLING. The HODL gods punished me well.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:44
I thought the same thing than you when i bought at 4.6k and it went down to 3.5k few days later....
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:49:04
I love coinmarketApp, all the cryptos are on it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:56:00
That s what I do, main investment in BTC and then I got a few small investments in ETH, LTC,XMR, because those are cheap coins with maybe some chances of rising high. Beware of ICOs though Andreas A. said that 99.9% of ICOs will just fail.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:48:00
I dont see that happening unless all the newbies sell off in panic, even if it would reach 5k some whales would buy back + auto buy orders and it would go back up in a very short time.  I wish 5k tho so I can buy some more.

Jaxx is pretty good

Travel, at least it worked for me. Of course I wish I would not need to worry or be constantly limited by money, but man, you can obtain great memories by just traveling alone (as I did), it cost little ( a flight ticket + visa + some more for everything else), the secret is that you must work there.
Working in a foreign country changes the whole traveling experience, as you ll meet people, mostly from work and accommodation (backpackers/hostel) and live the real thing. 
I would recommend Australia. Make friends, get a 4WD and go for a road trip for a few months, living by the day, working in farms, exploring everywhere is to me, much more valuable than few millions. 
Because when I 'll die I want to tell myself "well you dead but at least you lived some amazing stuff, here is the entire movie of it, please sit back, and relax"
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:40:49
Thanks for explaining details about it, but the fees should go back down a some point right? 
I am also wondering why those wallets do not include segwit transactions, for cheaper fees.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:33:08
WTF is going on with the fees ? AUD $76 to move AUD $200 from jaxx to a paper wallet ! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:32:20
Haha you should shill out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:24:01
PANIC BUUUUUUYYYYYY
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:16
There is no winning nor losing, it is not a competitive match, it is a revolution and we the people have the power to decide which coin we wanna use and what the value is.
You should watch some A.A. videos mate.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:11:19
You are more than welcome mate
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:03:11
Initial Coin Offering. Like a crowdfunding but with cryptos. You basically buy coins to support a project. 
I advise you to go watch some videos of the smartest guy in the crypto community. He explains so well he actually changed my perception of cryptos. Anyone getting into BTC should listen to Andreas.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:37:46
Its a very good question, we need Andreas A. on this one.
EDIT: Just found that one:  [Bitcoin Q&amp;A: Energy consumption](

You don't even need to count calories, just need to eat lots of fruits and veggies, less meat, less carbs and the most important, less sugar.
Being more active is an obvious thing to do as well, especially if you work sitting.

Oh yeah you're right it helps but its quite time consuming and boring (to me at least). There is a few golden rules to respect that are life changing and easy, like avoiding anything processed and overly sweet stuff. 
 Like coke should be illegal IMO, 40g of processed sugar in one single can is criminal when you know that the maximum intake is 20g a day.
The food industry wants people to watch out for fat content, so they can sell their fat reduced bullshit with huge amount of sugars to make taste edible. E.g. that 98% fat free mayonnaise that contains about 30% of sugar in it... bastards.

I d rather be poor and healthy/good looking than rich and dying of obesity.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:27:03
Yet. The tech isn't ready and the apps around it even less. Decentralized exchanges are already here (don't remember the name tho), segwit is not supported by most apps and LN is still in his infancy. 
There is a lot to come and more and more devs working on it. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:27:44
You can buy for just $10 if you want.
You should check the info post on this sub, there is everything on it for newcomers.
And welcome by the way ! :)

Thats why you can back your wallet up. You wont loose your funds even if you drop your phone in lava.

I ve got a few white ones in the garden if you are interested. When my dog eat bones the shit is white.

Hahahaha.... 
I live in Australia :'(
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:26:14
It will get back down for sure so I ll do the same if I were you. 
Good idea to buy a little every week. 
If I would have put all my savings in BTC instead of that shit bank account I d be rich.
But yeah if my grand mother would have wheels she would be a bus, as we say.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:24:27
Yeah but with "if" you can rewrite the whole history. Look at the future mate! I ve got some for my little 18yo sista as well, even though she didn't really understood/givadamn, I hope that one day those 100e of BTC will become 10000 and she d be like "best brother ever"
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:49:44
Im with you...
My gf wanted me to get her some cryptos, I was like "wanna wait a little more or I get it at 4,600?"
She said " no just buy them now".
Then we went to bed. I woke up at 6.40am and saw it was down to 3,900. I couldn't believe how unlucky she was on this one.
