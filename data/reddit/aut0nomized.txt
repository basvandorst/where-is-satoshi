Maybe a zero.

This sounds like something interesting. Have you got more information?
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:52:40
Sure have, we offer free delivery on all Australian orders. 
The snacks are for international customers who can't purchase gift cards and that is AU$10 flat rate or if the Oder is over AU$50 it's free.

Hey guys,
Just letting you know that I have taken some of the feedback from my original post and modded our website to work better and cater to more needs.
I would like to point out the fact that we offer gift cards with free shipping to our Aussie mates and free shipping to anyone who spends over AU$50.
So please have a look, follow us on our social media sites and as always happy to take special requests and suggestions.

Edit: Sorry read you comment a little quick. You will have a remaining balance of $10 on the card for your next purchase. You can always use the remaining $10 plus the difference in fiat if your next purchase is over $10

Ok fair enough, I have dropped the price. The price I used was on a singular purchase. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:41:00
Yes, some of the prices may seem a little high, but I was not planning on moving the price of the products with the exchange rate to a certain extent. 
As for shipping, there is a free shipping threshold of B .08 which I realise now I should have advertised.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:26:40
Yes, I agree with you but the bitcoin plugin that I am currently using doesn't have that option yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:31:41
Shipping is not included but there is a free shipping threshold of B 0.08 spend.

Yes, I like that graph it helps explain to people how it works. 
The difference with bit coin is you could see the chart develop like that in a lot less time then stocks, property or gold.
