What does alegal mean?
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:14:36
Right, I was thinking the same thing. How is something out of any juridiction? I thought anything that isn't formally typed, it's still on it, making it ambiguous but still legal.

Of course people will want to choose the terrorists, hackers, weirdo fork over the institutional-backed fork. /s
Thing is, they have enough power to sell the "private blockchain" as he himself has pointed out. That's why this is bad, but it's far from beeing the end. As you said, you don't need permission to innovate, and institutions, governments, possess A LOT of metadata which puts them in a better offering possition of "innovators". 
Edit: sorry for bad format, I actually don't know how to write better on reddit :(

So we must be cautious, Bitcoin ETF can start a series of events that could lead to an eventual centralization from which we won't be able to turn back. He's got a point where he talks about how oncoming privacy developments could potentially be shut down when big players (and governments) enter the game, not because they have the power to do so, but because they most certainly will have the power to influence people to buy their bullshit. But as he himself has said before, we've got to make privacy (or other descentralized-related tech) more apealing than centralized ideas.

Hi guys, I was thinking this:   
What if the nodes that vote on a given block are randomly chosen? Like, everybody is mining but no one would know who are the ones that are voting. any thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:17:36
Have you thought on showing yourself to the public and maybe prepare some words to inspire the world? You are a hero men, I'm from chile and no one even knows about crypto, so I talk about it with my friends and I always tell them about you. If there's a heaven, you're god in there.

If ver is a threat to bitcoin, then bitcoin isn't worth a shit given the fact that it's surviving banks, but apparentely it won't survive roger ver lol.

I was speaking to meltem demirors a few months ago, about how everybody keeps bullshitting about Bitcoin being descentralized, but it has so many centralized flaws that they end up eating their own tails. She said: you want descentralization? Then work for it, go fucking do something for the things you want.
I love that woman.

This sub is happening to be a perfect example of what andreas antonopoulos said about the rising popularity of a technology. Weird People that made it interesting are no longer here to make it interesting.

It's obviously a reference to cryptocurrency, and of course he must know, don't be such a pain in the ass.

Bitcoin can be whatever the fuck it needs to be. Just leave it bearish to buy more.
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:14:39
Dude, all OP just said was a "joke" related to crypto and buying low, because we are in the bitcoin subreddit. You can't be such an asshole. Is it my turn to guess? I'd guess you are so comfortable with your life decisions that you have to be an asshole to people after a fucking joke. 
@_date: 2019-08-10 03:01:42
what's the problem with it?     
Everybody knows Litecoin, for example, is better for micropayments, they've been saying it for years.    
BCH is not exactly used for micropayments, but their philosopy is to be used for payments, different than BTC which has been developed to store value.      
So, why would a company use its hashing power to attack these irrelevant txs?     
More so, why would I, average user of litecoin, fear an attack? I'm not moving millions, right?    
And a coordinated attack on the blockchain by anonymous actors would be far from profitable, unless the conditions are optimal. This is the only case it makes sense to attack the blockchain, and it has happened very few times in history.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:47:21
I think andreas misses a point here. What if quantum technology is used to disrupt the blockchain, only once? What will be its impact? Can this actor go back 1 block, 2 blocks, 6 blocks? Can he change the protocol?
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:38:21
I'm trying to, you're not helping.
@_date: 2019-06-13 08:33:07
it doesn't.   
It creates a desirable environment that creates its on rules, when the power behind it allows them. The power itself is dynamic. It is built upon rules and creates more rules.   
Therefore, Bitcoin is subjected to these rules. Creating corruption.
@_date: 2019-06-11 04:02:49
I admire andreas for his way of explaining Bitcoin, thanks to him I understood it in the first place and have tought it to others. But it's hard when this fucking friend goes "bitcoin is a pyramid scheme" and you only have like a minute of his attention to explain him basically what took me an entire week of searching stuff. At one point, when my friends were so eager to point out the "obvious bullshit" in bitcoin, I just told them to fucking sit and listen to what I'm going to say because I ain't talking about this shit again with you unless you understand these key concepts.   
Now ethereum... holy fuck it has been hard to explain. My dad is clueless about all of this shit, imagine telling him how that crap works.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:52:16
I'm from Chile, we've been protesting for over a week now. People died, many are hurt. The government and the congress will pass bills that will make the public happy. And that takes money. We already were in an economic regression so this will take us much further that path. And this is happening all across the globe. So what I'm saying is that bitcoin will moon because it will be the visible option to this catastrophe.

I think Libra could bring efficiency to online mainstream payments, which is good.    
And as it hasn't especified how is this PoS going to work and when (they said the consensus will "eventually" be open, lol), it's not exactly a "new challenger".

But it can, with coloured coins, satoshi's coins, etc. A rather unfortunate problem on bitcoin's fungibility.

Man, the joke is that venezuelan people use bitcoin as a currency, contradicting the posters in the pic.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:36:58
I think Bitcoin is a lot of things, and there are a lot of people out there coming out with ideas of microtransactions, offline wallets, etc.   
So I'd say that trend is, if anything, getting stronger. And we will see it. Vitalik said "2019 is the year of the second layer solutions". 
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:14:44
I don't understand why some companies once accepted bitcoin and then they stopped. I mean, what changed their minds? Why now? 
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:19:23
Well to begin with, rather than expecting crypto to solve social problems of inequality, I was thinking more in a way of changing the way people WITH money (different from millionares) will have a new freedom of investment that will allow them to express theirselves and their concernes. Not just paying taxes to contribute and work, but investing in start-ups, just as an example. Note that this is just a "crypto could" line of thought. I'm not saying crypto already won or that it will.

What an idiotic statement lol there are no correct responses
@_date: 2019-09-23 05:01:45
This is incorrect.      
The fact that fiat can increase at governments means it can be much more inflationary than bitcoin. Even gold is inflationary. The point here is we all can have a stake on how is something inflating, thanks to the consensus algorithms. You can't have much of a stake on your US dolars, for example.

@_date: 2018-07-04 03:10:41
Well, it's not that I know the absolute truth behind these kind of bans around the world;
But there are A LOT of scams on the cryptocurrency space and some of them you don't even have to worry about law prosecution because there is NO LAW about it. So that's huge. Believe it or not, a lot of naive people is being scammed and you gotta do something as a government (or legislator) because that is one of your goals, to protect people from this. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:38:39
I don't agree with that line of thought. Descentralized applications can have leaders now and in years to come. Smart contracts may evolve eventually to the point in which everything is descentralized, but that is just a possibility.
You don't say "not killing someone with a gun is the polar opposite of shooting a gun" 
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:52:47
So we believe in something, and as it doesn't take off, we tend to believe it will remain the same.    
Afterwards, IF it takes off, we keep thinking it won't go as far as we thought when we "believed" in it. But this happens IF it takes off. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:32:49
bitcoin as the technology (not the coin) will have usage i believe, but I think it still won't be a payment system.   
It will be like with computers. Yeah, back then we could have computers or don't, it didn't matter that much. But companies REQUIRED them, and with it, knowledge that few had.    
So, how do you think bitcoin is going to evolve to provide that utility?
