Holy shit, I think your right!

You really are a Boomer lol. Happy for you, dude.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:41:17
Exodus wallet. Free to simple. Also, Coinbase Pro is free to use while also sidestepping fees. I recommend you use that service once you become familiar.

Finding support at the 26EMA on 1 hour chart. Honestly, a little correction is due.

Real HODL'er roll call!
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:40:24
That's my logic too but I don't care to argue over terms. It's ridiculous regardless of name
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:13:35
Why do people buy Gucci, Prada, Coach, etc? Not currency but a show of money. BTC can be a luxury too, man!

You know you can use Tradingview if you want to do technical analysis? Pretty sure it's free. Oh, and also better than MS Paint.

You, sir, are a gentleman and a scholar. I wouldn't have checked but was happy to do it. 
Let's gooooo!

You bought a Bitcoin as in an entire 1BTC?
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:08:23
Ummm, if your trading currency with a $1k spread then your spaced out
@_date: 2019-06-19 04:07:30
By law, you're freaking me out

@_date: 2019-06-25 22:30:50
Thanks for the backup, I stand by those two services as my main system of accumulation and online storage. Not a trader of BTC by any means but also don't prefer to offline every transaction, rather do so in bulk to cold storage at different stages of accumulation.
Good luck and fair winds!
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:24:15
A stone a day into the pond is better than the whole handful at once. If you prefer to put all your savings into BTC, the best bet would be to continually add over time.
*By no means financial advice.*

@_date: 2019-06-18 23:42:35
Yes, not sure why they renamed/brandee but it was GDAX. I send money directly there and trade because of the low fees.
Give it a try!
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:57:32
Will you please continue buying until 8k ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:06:27
Oh, cool. I was about to recommend maybe a dollar cost avg. approach since it's on a tear right now but good to hear you went in smart. Not that my opinion matters but buying 1 BTC off the rip is ballsy! Welcome to ride, brotha!
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:41:24
Haha. Damnit, he tried!
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:00:48
Where have you attempted to buy Bitcoin in which you paid "hefty fees"? Hefty is subjective, so do you care to share what you consider hefty? Maybe someone can point you in the right direction, provide some low fee insight if you will.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:34:44
This is exactly what I fear my kids would hate me for if I didn't HODL. You will have your time.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:55:37
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:13:40
That's very broad logic but ok. I don't see a dip to 6k, although it would be nice, but who really knows. Almost a bearish engulfing candle on the daily so a retracement to mid 8's is certainly a possibility. Just my opinion!
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:44:56
Stoked to be old enough to give a fuck and young enough to actively participate. Like past family reflected on the Great Depression, we will brag on our decentralization of currency. Fucking badass.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:43:12
If you put money into BTC via Robinhood you don't actually own any. If you want to have BTC to your name, get started on Coinbase, buy the amount you want, then send that portion to a wallet offline.
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:53:28
My God, this is genius. I'm by no means a financial guru but this is great. Thanks for all the information and background, I am definitely going to take a look into nexio. As a matter of fact, I was just debating with someone the other day who was concerned about having to sell assets to pay bills in a potential recession. This could definitely be a solution. And honestly I think more growth will come during a recession.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:51:52
Sensationalization. One of many tactics, but still not buying what your selling.
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:04:17
Coinbase Pro?
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:36:29
That's a pretty cool link
@_date: 2019-06-18 16:10:55
We know when Bitcoin will be at its final original accumulation, only broken into smaller portions to create "more". Bitcoin won't be the backer of a fiat currency such as good was, and accumulating Bitcoin according to price is only a thing now while we have a tangeable currency to compare it to. When it's no longer feasible to accumulate cash, that tipping point will come as access to BTC becomes *easier*, price will be a delusion. It only matters how much trash you managed to trade to accumulate the new.
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:29:28
This would be a book I read to my kids.
@_date: 2019-06-11 00:18:43
I'm so glad I checked back on this poetic Justice.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:58:50
You will. Life doesn't *seem* fair because your perspective is only 17 years old, man. At your age, your parents couldn't talk to a manufacturer in China for free from home, start a business online and expose the world to product in 24 hours, whip a mini computer out of their pocket and do business. The fact you know what forex is and you can participate from your phone is a fucking dream for many people.
Brother, you have so much opportunity to succeed the only reason you won't is because you don't know how or you don't care to. The former requires some research, thick skin and unwaivering peristance and loads of accountability. The former is an attitude problem and I don't know what to tell you.
You will get 1BTC. Chip away, don't stop, and HODL.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:59:01
Good shit! Some is more than none, and when you want something as bad as you want your next breath of air, you can't not achieve it. It's cliche and wack sounding but when you shove your head under water, you definitely come up. Let that feeling drive you to obtain anything and everything you want. 
Use Coinbase Pro to buy if your going Coinbase route, it will save you money giving more bang for your buck.
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:48:05
Coinbase Pro - No fees to transfers to wallet and minimal fees to buy BTC. Much cheaper than Coinbase (non-pro).
Exodus Wallet - Free and SegWit enabled. 
God speed!
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:13:22
If you want to send USD, use Venmo. If you want to store and spend BTC, use a real wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:59:11
Very true. The Richest Man in Babylon is a great read and touches on this.
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:45:28
That's a stretch of a game plan but I guess it makes sense. Seems really desperate since the people who are interested in buying know better, and someone who doesn't would likely ask someone before just buying. I could be wrong but I am curious how many folks have fallen for this gimmick. Freaking nuts.
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:59:43
Just get an Exodus wallet
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:55:11
IMO, a dip to support under 12k for a bit is coming. Wouls be nice to chill there for a bit!
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:58:02
Hmmm, based on?
@_date: 2019-06-19 04:11:12
Holy shit, this is priceless. Thanks for the share!

Anyone who lives on Earth in 100 years is fucked.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:45:18
I can't promise you anything, but the current push for privacy, connectedness, security and independence makes me believe something else will come along. It may not be BTC, but there will be many more opportunities to place *money* somewhere and get a return. 
If you feel like your missing out because it's something your passionate about, then find a way to generate some revenue and buy! You can easily set up a Coinbase commerce and start accosting BTC as payment, that could be a strategy for accumulation. 
If you feel like your missing out because of all the *potential* returns, you can learn and practice trading forex and makes a shit ton of money. 
There are opportunities to make a fuck ton of *cash* with discipline, rules and effort. Hell, you can learn crypto from a technical stance and create a solution to people's problems, I wish I was young in school when this shit was coming to surface. Uou have inctesible opportunity. You will be fine.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:45:09
And now back to 11k. Gotta be tougher than that!
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:45:02
Damn. That really stinks. Did you try Coinbase again like mentioned earlier? Curious if that worked?
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:10:53
Yes. Stick to your Coinbase Pro plan.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:04:40
Sorry champ, I'm buying property on Mars with my BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:38:46
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:09:58
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:58:05
Crazy. Last I checked there was like 360 for sale and 100s leading up to it.
@_date: 2019-06-19 12:08:22
It lets you borrow against your investment without having to sell.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:16:31
Looks like Robinhood
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:32:47
Yes, you should buy *some* BTC today. You should also continue buying *some* BTC. Not all at once and not none at all, keep accumulating.
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:27:35
You paid 1k transaction fee and bought 1 BTC? I can't imagine paying over $30.
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:36:57
Ok, I'll take that and stand corrected. Paying $1k in transaction fees to obtain $11k worth of BTC is absolutely insane.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:03:34
Yesterday is history
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:30:10
They didn't mention a percentage. I can't imagine AT&amp;T accepting any portion of Bitcoin as a payment because of extreme volatility.
They are utilizing a third party (BitPay) who converts to fiat and pays AT&amp;T therefor avoiding risk. 
This is a step in the right direction by by no means a direct p2p Bitcoin payment.
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:22:54
This is a great point. No one is sharing keys, info is way to sensitive plus people kill people for life insurance, I can't imagine a private key. 
Anyways, until a solution to this is made, Bitcoin will only last until *maybe* the next century. 
Make your money while you can!!!
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:26:44
You need to read, The Richest Man in Babylon before you invest anything. 
Everyone knows it's steady input over extended time frames, not all at once brotha!

@_date: 2019-05-15 14:41:33
1) who is your target market? what do they do for a living? Where do they spend their time both online and in person? 
2) Why does your target market need this? What are their pain points and which of those does your excel sheet solve?
3) Are they other resources they currently use? If so, why is your better? 
Once you answer  you will use  and  to put your product in their hands. This is not all inclusive but may help get you there.
I don't have a need for this so I cant tell you where to find these folks, but you can! An idea and product is only as good as it's execution. It looks like you have value to me but I am not in your industry so you will have to answer those questions.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:56:59

@_date: 2019-05-30 04:51:38
Hmmmm...selling for a loss (assuming) then spending cash? I can't see how that would be a better alternative than buying everything you possibly can with Bitcoin, cutting all unnecessary expenses, and continuing to average down when possible. 
Maybe I just haven't been in the scenario, but even in the stock market selling is far more risky than holding through.
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:55:40
I think you make a landing page, something simple, with screen shots and an over view of the tool along with benefits.
Create content here on Reddit, maybe some Instagram posts, medium blog posts, launch on Product Hunt, post on Indie Hackers.
Also, crypro traders is good but think bigger. Crytpo traders enjoy finance - maybe target Forex as well? There some some forex niches on insta, Reddit, etc. How about folks on stock twits? Hit all "traders" if you will, make some sales, get some emails, the refine your target. 
If you need a landing page, let me know. I can throw something together that look professional and collects payments and make it affordable for you. You need to tell a story! Stories sell! You don't need to be the hero here, you need to provide the tools so everyone else can be the hero!
Hope this helps!
