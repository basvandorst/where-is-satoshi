Fee's for POS are amazing small, inexistent. Withdrawal at ATM is low like 3$ per withdrawal, but it's worth to withdrawal only at big amounts. I usually use it for POS 99% of times.

You don't know that you can Press Release anything on any media outlet in world ? . Oh poor guy . Man you can buy articles on Wall Street Journal , Yahoo , BBC , Huffington Post actually on ALL NEWS MEDIA OUTLETS IN THIS WORLD . Who says they aren't taking money are balantly lying . As well as you mister who wrote this article . You probabily pissed cause you don't have a slice of all that money ? And YES we admit we take cryptocurrencies or bitcoin for press releases and i don't see nothing wrong with it . Specially when i even do giveaways and help in their distribution to population . I really don't see NOTHING WRONG . 
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:30:09
wow . Hahaha that's hilarious . But no seriously if you got that thinking use that website .
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:57:07
Actually it's not a problem :) and we admit it . We have NO PROBLEM WITH THAT WHATSOEVER ! I am just amused of your republican closed-minded person that you are . We are moving the economy and helping creating jobs &amp; opportunites . What do you do ? :) 
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:24:30
Exactly you call on bullshit , because you are envy . I can see CCN offered you a job ? If you are in that dispair of money and want to be part of this economy be part of it . Embrace it . This was way before we even existed in Media that we are daily reading  , it was part of Meda &amp; News from the time it when kids were selling newspaper in the corner of the street . You think you can change something ? Then create your own News website , pay the advertising , pay your editors , pay all necessary to keep it running . My question it's from where if not from Advertorials &amp; Advertising ? Or if you don't get a donation from a certain community and your article gets ignored , you going to write about them again ? So yes i can only see envy and no logic whatsoever . I asked you for a business model , a solution to the problem you mention  . Where is your solution ? Tell me and we will follow it . Specially when you are little and you start with little to none advertising budget . That's why i call it envy . 
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:55:07
For sure it should accept too ! 
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:29:40
Jump with a solution . Or you are just a troublemaker ? :) and nothing to do all day ? Why we are dishonest ? First before that you should take ALL YOUR CRYPTOCURRENCY FROM ALL EXCHANGES THAT ACCEPT PAID-VOTES . It's against your belief from start . Dishonest ? I am totally honest . Yes we accept bounties for our articles . And WHAT ?! If we see something that's not quite right we mention in article ! I can show you a few paid articles that have BAD NOTES in it regarding what it's bad REGARDING THEM . But you are enclosed in that lil box of yours screaming " Stop , stop this people are making money for writing , they are impostors , kill them all " . Pathetic . 
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:10:40
This guy is so retarded that he never heard of Press Release services :) that get your news on all major news websites . But it's a bit behind ...it lacks of money i guess ...it's hungry or something .

It's so simple to see . I don't know why are you hidding like that . But i guess you want free advertising and couldn't afford to pay . If any smart user will look on profile will notice that all he done on reddit was commenting on Coin Fire articles . It's so easy . And also they are posts on Bitcoin regarding Coin Fire that he wrote making publicity to your website , much before this . So you telling me that has no affiliation what so ever when all his profile it's full of pages and activity on CoinFire community &amp; spreading CoinFire articles . And not just USMS coverage .  - Let me give you some titles "NewEgg + BitPay Ends Speculation Regarding BitPay Announcement for Tuesday" - " Tim Draper says VC, Investment Banking and Banking Are Going to Change (Updating)" - "Mastodon Makes Waves With 6th Position on Billboard" i can keep it like that ? Or you understood that we can see clear crystal that he is a shill of yours . I won't continue . I will let you guys have this one ;) You played it well .

@_date: 2014-07-14 14:29:41
Yeah buddy :) it amuse me with his post . It won't do a thing . Press Release Services are before he was even BORN . So i think he needs to go back and learn more about Media &amp; News . He don't realise to keep a media agency you need to pay adverise and hosting and editors ... I advise him to check out all News Agency Owners reddit accounts i bet all have paid at least once ads on reddit . That's moving the economy . But what could you ask from an ....i have no words for such uneducated human like him . 
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:37:15
Well when you find a solution contact me , then you can call me whatever you want . Until then you are full of bullsh*t and hate . Nothing MORE . Nothing . Have a nice day ... hopefully .. since you are full of hate and bs envy i can't figure it how your day will be nice , bad persons don't really have good days . They always bad &amp; full of hate. So contact me with a solution and then maybe we can speak humanly &amp; serious . Until then i can only see a very fustrated person , without solution and only so called "problems" .

We don't abuse nobody trust . We are posting fact based news . We are taking every information we can get about them on boards and we simply publish them .

We don't do sh*t like that . I think MY TIME SHOULD BE RESPECTED , PERIOD . If you don't respect my time involved in researching a coin , writing and offering my critical opinion , then how should i respect you ? Make some logic and sense and imagine how many news you read and they were paid without your knowladge on broad media . And to be honest ,very honest many of those trusthworthy websites are lying because we worked with some of their sponsors &amp; coins and we got devs telling us but heh that's another "issue" cause i don't see any issue getting paid for your work .

Yeah its happening. See what drama of that bs. BitcoinXT is doing to us ? :) 
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:52:35
WTF this dude talking about? Like really. WTF?! He said at one time in that github pull that transactions are 0.25$ fee. Seriously ?! They are 0.02$ for under 10 minutes confirmation! Max 0.03$ and get it under 5 minutes confirmed. I bought products that use Bitcoin as payment method and I am pretty sure it was SUPER instant. Under 20 seconds.
@_date: 2015-08-20 00:34:28
As guys from video said . Bitcoin-XT is BAD MOJO! Also Gavin &amp; Mike should not be suck butthurts and put their brain together with Core Developers for a better solution.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:08:02
I feel like this will go even more down. I regret that I didn't sold my 100 BTC's at 260$ .... I lost 3k$ because of that. Also if you look on all exchanges the support is so low that in any second the price can fall under 200$ anytime now. Why all this ? Simple as me people are sick of this argue , black or white , good or evil , Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin XT :) All it does is making Bitcoin harder to adopt, harder to trust into it.
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:33:15
Yes because I was a true believe of Bitcoin. But with Bitcoin-XT ...what an lame name ...anyway with this B.S! I am starting to lose confidence big time. And make me regret all my investment of time &amp; money.
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:10:57
No I don't day trade. I am just a big Bitcoin supporter from 2013 ... nothing more. I don't trade I earn Bitcoin by offering my services. But what is going on now it makes me cash all in FIAT and relax from all this DRAMA. Last night in that flash dump I was gone from 20.000$ to 16.000$ in my Bitcoin value... It's a bit fustrating ..a bit more. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 22:01:24
What a big BS. I must admit I was agreeing with the increase of block-size. But as I saw last few months of transaction stress test. I do think Bitcoin can leave another good years with the blocksize that is now. Now people will lose money due to this hardfork. I don't want to lose mine. So I am thinking seeing this retarded war. Is to sell all my Bitcoins and wait to see how this will go on . But that will not be just be. Will be others to, because nobody wants to lose Bitcoins because some Bitcoin coup and forcefully hardfork.
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:43:11
2FA bypassed ? How that's possible. Hmmm..
@_date: 2015-08-20 00:15:15
Read the article and feed your brain with useful info. You don't want Bitcoin to have a centralized decision "Mike" to be it's dictator and Gavin ... seriously.... you don't want that. Also the scalling issue it's people already working on it not just 2 psyho's also a big meeting in september regarding Bitcoin Scalling. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:16:04
Well it's not about you Greg , it's about Gavin. Who went and speak with them ...we don't know what:) .
But me as a long member of Bitcoin community and user. Thank you and Core team for staying strong against this coup. Just speaking with CIA itself those who tortured hundred of peoples in their broad concentration camps ..is evil . 
I know you guys will find a solution or even increase block size in a safe way.  Keep on the good job.
@_date: 2015-08-22 02:04:05
yeah Mike is an egocentristic male *****. People should know that.
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:02:02
So far the results are what I expected. The trust is low.
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:13:14

@_date: 2015-08-22 09:43:36
And the rest can do the same as they are commit access developers. :) And they will remove him from that also. I really sorry to say but these 2 guys are destroying Bitcoin itself.... 
By the way in their really small mind, they have tough at bandwith usage? Like literally at al ? Some people have only 500GB-1TB bandwith cap...over that they pay extra. Specially in US.
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:32:53
I can say you one thing. It will lose a lot of value and we can see an under 100$ very soon. Why? Incertitude , drama , childish acts.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:01:22
Not really is here. your post. But yeah XT morons just fucked up. Not to say about Gavin and that Mike guy. I hope they leave Bitcoin community as soon as possible.
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:51:29
Thanks for your positive reply. But XT is just a brining big bad name to Bitcoin Community, Economy and even to the name itself. It sounds so Ugly. Bitcoin-XT ... I am like WTF?! Anyway Now again I should've sold at 234.... I don't know what is in my head waiting for this to blow up to the ground...I am idiot for not selling. And maybe buy back when this drama and cock fight is over.
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:15:35
Gavin should leave Bitcoin foundation as soon as possible. Because he is a total moron and most of people who support Bitcoin XT. You guys don't see that the core team are discussing and debating the right approach for achieving Low Fee's and fast confirmation without fuck up bitcoin on long term. That's why is a freaking Summint at the start of september called :"Scalling Bitcoin" wtf.... why people are so retarded with BitcoinXT bs.
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:53:17
Finally ! Mike &amp; Gavin are very evil. BitcoinXT is part of FBI / CIA plan when Gavin went and meet them! 
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:32:40
Yup , can't be worst then that.
@_date: 2015-08-22 09:21:20
What subs ? BitcoinXT Aka BitcoinNSA ? 
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:33:53
This is simple bs , and it's affecting Bitcoin Economy.

Dictatorship happens in both situation. Authoritarianism is actually at the base of Communist gov's.
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:08:02
Well I have nothing against bigger blocks. I am against Mike &amp; Gavin being in charge by themselves. Specially against Mike. That he offers hisemf to be the Benevolent Dictator of Bitcoin code.
@_date: 2015-08-21 22:44:08
I am stopping you ? Or anybody else. Sure go with the dictator. While some countries are looking to escape dictatorship.
@_date: 2015-08-26 21:50:22
Yes all people should get their funds &amp; bitcoins out of Bitfinex ASAP. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:53:46
Yeah we should sorry since that flash crash had left people without liquidity and even broke because their stop loss didn't triggered on time. Also it is an uncertinity due software factor and many other factors. Because of this flash crash I can see it go below 100$ 
@_date: 2015-08-22 10:33:17
Yes but US is pretty much bandwith capped. 
I also wanted to say something . People seem so obfuscated about Blockstream....while Mike Hearn is pushing commits so BitcoinXT to work better with his app Lighthouse ... :) Just sayin' ...everyone is following their own PERSONAL agenda. Not to say that Gavin &amp; Mike are ...in hands with gov...it would be to much and without 100% evidence ...but their acting looks like .


-Mike Hearn, BitcoinXT developer, lead author of Anti-DoS "patch"
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:30:20
Yes it has to do with all the drama. I said it for couple of days that this will be a harsh suffering for the whole Bitcoin Economy.
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:20:10
Wow this article is good for brain. He is 100% right. Nobody should support Bitcoin-XT if they aren't aware of the damage they are doing. If they support it then , they want to see Bitcoin dead!

@_date: 2015-08-22 09:25:47
Well they pretty much have a very aggressive community right now. And if you want I can search you something interesting, that Mike is planing and posted on Bitcointalk....if it isn't reaching 75% he plans to do a major cluster f***. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 21:05:19
Allegation. You guys don't know how to read a god damn code! All you see is increase of blocksize ! The rest you ignore ... WTF?!
@_date: 2015-08-22 10:27:58
True words. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 09:27:18
Not really. He can't do shit and his EGO is suffering because of that. That's why is doing BitcoinXT a.k.a BitcoinNSA a.k.a BitcoinCIA .
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:36:39
They didn't nosedived that hard. But they did nosedive :) They only had more buy support then bitfinex. But the gap is still there. 
Bitstamp from 249 to 221$ , Huobi from 1600 to 1440 CNY ... and so on. The big gap is still there. Everywhere. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:58:25
Neah they don't . Your coins are very safe in COLD STORAGE. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 02:40:20
I don't know. I have the same view as you have. But some are selling in hope to bleed more and own even a bigger chunk
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:09:27
I will search for you, an beautiful Mike comment that if he doesn't achive the 75% he will force it.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:04:46
Sadly BitcoinXT bs will kill Bitcoin overall. Thanks Gavin and Mike!
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:56:13
Hearn and Gavin are increase block size as an excuse to do other commits that invade your privacy .
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:47:14
Yes circle.com is an amazing service and gives CLASS to coinbase.
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:41:48
Yes it's a joke of company. I heard that before. And they are doing it over and over again. They aren't having the best customer support, you end up getting an answer in 2-3-4 days. And when you get it's a copy-paste answer. We will make an article regarding Coinbase ugly support &amp; cancellations soon. 
I can tell you I am very pleased using Circle.com, no such issues like that with them. And I suggest everyone to move from this Hitler type of service "Coinbase" to "Circle" which is easier and after some time you can do instant buy with your Bank account!!
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:54:49
Most of BitcoinXT adepts are having big tin foils on their heads all they see is Blockchain increase. They don't see other commits to the project that put in danger their privacy and also giving Bitcoin to 2 communist leaders like Mike &amp; Gavin who wants to take over Bitcoin with full collaboration with FBI and CIA.
@_date: 2015-08-22 00:48:39

@_date: 2015-08-20 00:55:29

@_date: 2015-04-03 15:56:49
I must agree , the fact that the small miners who are doing it right now are going on loss. You are better of buying straight from market. Or else you end up exchanging coins for energy . Which is like buying coins from a high-fee exchange. 
Centralized mining, be serious we all know about FARMS, and you know that some are so big that they had to split around so nobody will notice that is centralized. You know that guy from china who is mining almost 1 mil$ / month of bitcoin. Right ?
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:23:41
Good job! I have a lot of Bitcoins also. All my cash assets are in Bitcoin. Some people may say that you are crazy. But let them think that. Let them sell now and clear the market as much as they can.

And what bitcoins aren't money ? Then you don't know their real concept and you use them as only a get rich scheme and that's not the point of it . And now we are back to money . Yes they make the world goes around and a lot of in world are unfair because the money are at the wrong people full of greed . But if we become like them and have only money in our heads when we hit it big we won't make a real difference won't we ? .

That's not rich thats poverty . You Chinese people you are at the beginning of the bloom . I was in China in Yiwu and Shanghai i know the poverty the old lady's chasing you the streets for a few coins, but i know the rich too it's full with mercedes or copy-cats of them and tons of merchants, amazing buildings and business centers . . It's a big population it will take time until all will fill the wealth it's a long taking process and thats why your goverment don't want their wealth out of the country because then you will stay poor forever :) .

Q-coins, created by internet company Tencent, were banned in 2009, affecting millions of users, after authorities clamped down on virtual currencies being used to buy real-world services and products. What did you expect to happend with Bitcoin ? Get a warm hug ?

I hope people will keep calm . It's simple mathematics Chinese drop out like bunch of pu*** . No reason to panic . Many other countries never heard of it yet don't forget that !.  Chineese will follow much more later that's all when their fortune is more managed , now they afraid that their RICH population will flee out of country with their money , if CHINA was yours , i think you would be afraid of that too after all the sacrifices that China made too become an economical power ! Keep calm , drink a coffee , smoke a doobie and don't forget that you still have money :) . If you start to become sad search on google "Poor childs eastern europe" or "How people die in Syria" :) . I live in Romania , i am poor as fuck and i don't complain even if Bitcoin was giving me a big hope for moment . But i think long term :) So you too because BITCOIN is in hatch stage , few months ago everybody was ignoring now it got attention . EXPECT FULCTUATIONS ! Cheers &amp; Peace .

Yes i know . I worked to make it fast ;) . At age 15 years i was on blocks pulling network cables :D . Why Romania has high internet speed . Because of the people we made our own LAN's and few users have made ISP contracts and shared the internet too people those few users were are people like us wanting the best so they starting too pull 4-5-6 providers and spread too the network in one single provider so then a lot of peerings happened and because of that the big companys had too drop they prices like crazy . Now the big companys are buying this private networks one by one and they are switching all in full 1GBps network . Ah and yes very cheap components around here like 1km of cable 50$ . And we were all working pro-bono for us :P so that made the expansion very fast and local ISP's put money togheter and bought switched and cables and no more limits exagerate limits and all for 9$/month.

I hope people will keep calm . It's simple mathematics Chinese drop out like bunch of pu*** . No reason to panic . Many other oportunities open when one door close :). Chineese will follow much more later that's all ! Keep calm , drink a coffee , smoke a doobie and don't forget that you still have money and your freedom they don't have it full in this moment and this is the reprecussion of a country that lacks Freedom  . If you start to become sad and depressive search on google "Poor childs Eastern Europe" or "How innocent kids die in Syria " , "Sierra Leone Blood Diamonds":) . I don't see any of you crowding for any of the ALT-coins that research cancer like "Cure Coin" and then think again if you got a suicide tough . I see people scraping metal everyday why they don't have suicide toughts ? :) I always wonder . Cheers &amp; Peace.

Wait too see the hyperinflation that USA is preparing for the world . Then you will see "The Hunger Games". Then everybody that has bitcoin it will live without worry . Imagine if Zimbabwe people would had bitcoin before their hyperinflation sets , their wealth was untouched and they wouldn't need to cary bags of money to pay for a piece of bread . We need to learn as people too live off-the grid or else we saw how Big Depression 2 was :) . The second one it will be worst cause things got out of  control . I feel pitty for those without patience they only make it worse for temporary moment ;) Bitcoin can do it without them because of the large acceptance !
