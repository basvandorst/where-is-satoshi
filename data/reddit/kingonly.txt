Whenever there's a lightning tx, the state changes. Users need to maintain the off-chain tx information.
@_date: 2019-07-26 10:50:24
It's for the on-chain wallet. Doesn't help you to recover your off-chain funds.
Breez doesn't expose the on-chain wallet it's Lightning only).
@_date: 2019-07-29 12:10:03
Definitely. But even in places where bitcoin is a valid currency, the issue remains...
@_date: 2019-07-26 10:09:12
Breez is non-custodial. It backs up the channels to Google Drive.
@_date: 2019-07-26 10:11:58
With Breez, you simply restore the channels from Google Drive (we'll support iCloud soon). Channels remain open since the user has the lastest state. Using static backup, channels are closed, and you need to trust the other party to send you the correct state.
@_date: 2019-07-12 14:37:05
These channels are funded by Breez
@_date: 2019-07-26 10:43:21
I know Breez, Eclair and BLW have dynamic backup. Lightning Labs doesn't and not sure about the others.
@_date: 2019-07-26 10:55:04
Don't think so. I think the seed is like any other on-chain wallet seed. 
Where did you try to restore the seed?
Do you understand the seed doesn't help with you off-chain funds?
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:06:41
Not sure why... You can take a look at btcwallet which is the one lnd uses
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:46:41
Definitely. Will do. Thank you!
@_date: 2018-09-14 06:22:57
We'll also add the wallet soon
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:26:03
Thank you! Breez is open source btw... I'll be sure to make a PR once we have a release... Breez is build for cross-platform (written in Flutter/Go), but we will release iOS after Android.

We will support NFC w/o using a card (POS will pass the invoice directly to mobile). Bluetooth card is much more expensive than an NFC card.
The POS reads an identifier that will enable sending the invoice via mobile notification.

Unlike ISPs/Banks, barrier of entry is low. Users will choose a service they trust or choose arbitrarily. UX can be dead simple. The system will be decentralized due to proliferation of routing nodes and p2p connectivity. This is all written in the article. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:04:47
Read the article. Strike is a  mobile app with a card extension. There's big advantage to using a card, you can give it to someone else (and still approve the payment via your mobile app). 
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:11:19
I'm sure you'll find a system that helps people to have control of their money. I think you'll find a decentralized network that works with many hubs of different flavors. I also hope this network will facilitate p2p economics.

Also, if it wasn't clear, Breez simply uses ln node which is connected to other (non-breez) ln nodes. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 12:57:05
Yes, that's us! We absolutely love Flutter &amp; Dart. We'll take a look at Dartcoin... Btw, most of our business logic is in go... 
@_date: 2018-10-13 20:08:57
That's awesome! Let me know if we can help in any way... 
@_date: 2018-10-13 07:44:23
That's incorrect... You can use Breez to connect to other ln nodes.
Breez hub is an anonymous ln node. Breez uses a hub simply to bootstrap ln. 
I suggest you take a look at the code first... 
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:32:16
As it says in the article, there's a very low barrier of entry to become an LSP. You can even be your own LSP. There's no risk of centralization at all, on the contrary, this will provide support for P2P that will prevent users from using centralized solutions.
@_date: 2019-10-29 15:44:47
It's an open protocol, we're hoping more clients will support it.
@_date: 2019-10-29 13:10:18
We're hoping to have it available in Breez by EOY

It's layer 3

The use case is two mobile Lightning nodes (payer/payee)) running on mobile devices. When the wallet (support by the light node) is in the background, the node is inactive.

1. Currently Breez "eats" the fees, but it's a business decision, not a technical one. We can charge setup fees if needed.
2. It's a costly attack. It requires installing the Breez app, waiting for confirmation and the "know-how" of closing. Seems to be more costly than the fee.
@_date: 2019-06-18 10:21:40
I agree. Added to our todos.
@_date: 2019-06-18 09:41:51
If you opted to backup and there's no warning icon, it means the backup works.
Your channels state is saved to a private Google Drive folder (soon iCloud) only accessible by you via the Breez client. 
When you install the app, there's an option to restore fr backup.
@_date: 2019-06-09 04:53:03
See 
And 
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:17:01
So why IOU and not cash? Both on-chain and off-chain are Bitcoin transactions. There an extra layer of responsibility from the user's end with Lightning. Like there's no x number of confirmations in the chain to say the funds are yours, Lightning requires you to monitor your channels. 
It's not an IOU if I can pay anyone anytime w/o anyone's consent.
Think about it like a safe: I put cash in a safe and I need to make sure no one steals it from my safe. It's not an IOU - it's my money. In a Lightning based economy, the chain is just a distributed judge in case of a dispute.
@_date: 2019-06-18 09:52:20
Sorry I wasn't clear: if there's no warning, the backup works... 
Currently, the only way to see the last backup is via the logs (backup is executed on each tx). We'll add an issue to make it more explicit to avoid confusion. Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2019-10-29 10:40:29
UX can be very simple: Alice sends a unique link to Carol via WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram etc. It can also be an in-app feature.
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:22:06
If you mean atomic swaps, it's like asking what if the cash I have is in  euros and dollars. It doesn't change anything. It's still the same artifact(s) on and off the chain.
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:46:34
I think you need to better understand the basic concepts of P2P money.
1. Why "at least 3 block"? Why not 1, 6 or 100? In theory the chain needs to be validated endlessly... 
2. They are my bitcoins... The fact that someone can try and cheat me (by posting an old channel state or by trying to double spend on the chain) doesn't make them less my bitcoins... They are my bitcoin on 0,1,2,3...100 confirmations, right?
@_date: 2019-02-01 10:09:11
That's the idea behind Bitcoin. Trust yourself: 
Breez is about using Bitcoin, which means freedom for all.
A. Breez is not just Israelis
B. You really don't know my personal views, do you? 
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:06:26
There's no problem making tx lower than dust. There's an issue if I send someone under the dust tx while she has 0 balance. In this case, she wouldn't be able to spend the money due to 'channel reserve' mechanism (can't spend money below dust balance). So in theory, someone can cheat you and earn your dust - he will lose more money due to on-chain fee...
You can ask the bank the same question: how can I cash out an account with $0.001 in its balance.
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:09:10
Trust yourself: review, build, install: 
Why are we to blame for the crap other folks from Israel are doing?

It's not included in the app permission in iOS
It's a private app folder, so you can't see it in the Google Drive interface (only accessible via the creating app).

You are the one that is wrong. Both on Submarine Swaps description and on Loop description. I suggest you go and educate yourself instead of trying to educate me...  Loop is basically a branded Submarine Swaps (and reverse Submarine Swaps) service from Lightning Labs. Lightning Labs is a trustless 3rd party.
The link has a transcript btw. There are plenty of other resources out there as well. Google it.

@_date: 2019-06-03 15:52:36
Yes, but it's not anymore, is it? Just like cash, I don't need to claim it before I can spend it. LN transaction are Bitcoin transaction, same artifact: bitcoin (unlike in the case of IOU).
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:32:55
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:09:45
That's the first point... The second point is it's the same money, on-chain and off. Same artifact, unlike gold and paper money - that's the reason I reject the analogy.
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:39:40
Currently, only altruistic watchtowers exist. In the future, you would pay them to monitor, not necessarily in case of a cheat.

I think it tells a very partial story. Mobile clients like Breez, Zap, Lightning Labs opens private channels, so the adoption of mobile doesn't show up there. Also, from a Fiat value standpoint, I think the increase in network capacity is significant.
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:43:38
And I think this is well outlined in the post... We're working on an ISP-like model where users will be able to choose the inbound channel provider. Our goal is simple, to build a trustless solution for bitcoin payments with great UX to drive adoption. Our real competition is fiat, not other players in the ecosystem. We just doing what we can to advance the tech...

You can run a full node and use Neutrino to communicate with it. Don't you trust yourself?

We've released the source about a month ago and the project is super active. Why don't you give it try? Feel free to build it:  
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:03:22
I think there are a couple of things to consider:
1. You wouldn't have necessarily a direct payment channel to these places, it enough they will exist in LN. 
2. You wouldn't spend in LN more than what you would normally have using fiat. 
3. IMHO, one of the keys for LN's success is to keep the payment channels open.
As an example, take a look in the technology section here:

@_date: 2018-03-25 13:28:44
I’ve received a lot of positive feedback following my previous article, [Lightning Network is the Future of Bitcoin]( However, while reading some of the feedback, it became clear to me that some people don’t fully understand how Lightning Network (LN) actually works. In this article, I tried to demystify the concept behind LN and its payment channels using an abacus as a metaphor, without getting into the technical specifics of LN implementation.

Btw, Breez uses submarineswap when adding funds to the channel.

Breez server: 71 commits
I'm not counting the dozens of fixes we've committed to lnd, neutrino, btcwallet and our new submarineswap lib. Oh, and all this in a month (we created new repos when we've opened the code in GitHub).
Not sure where you got the 3 commits nonsense, but I suggest next time to take a deeper look before posting your rubbish.

This is NOT a hosted solution, Breez is a trustless solution... 
Breez client is a light Node (powered by Neutrino). The user is the only one with access to her funds.
When you install Breez client (a light node), a channel is automatically opened with the Breez hub (a standard ln node). This is funded by Breez...

Peter Thiel says that bitcoin is “like bars of gold in a vault that never move” and that it is too cumbersome to be used as a payment system. Lightning Network will hopefully prove him wrong.
