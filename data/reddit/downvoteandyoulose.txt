And... what happened?

If they let it slide they could possibly get their asses kicked really hard by the feds if word got out or that kind of activity was actually occurring.

Even if they did kill you, would they be able to "recover" any money off of you once they did? Otherwise, it's just a wasted effort.

That sounds like the equivalent of "I won't buy anything ever unless they accept Bitcoins."

I wouldn't be surprised if Coinbase had to report them to the feds.

So you want them to commit something that would end up causing them to have criminal charges and spend years in prison?
Edit: My bad about the duplicate comments. Reddit was 504ing at the time when I was trying to post.

Good thing you did that because they deleted the thread.

I've lost some respect for the pfSense project. Not because they refuse to accept Bitcoins but because of how their response to a suggestion was handled and the amount of ignorance from @_date: 2014-08-15 07:00:14
[I might have found the original post]( but since it's against rules to post screenshots of reddit the real original post may be hard to come by.

Oh derp, I should check the dates next time. Thanks.
