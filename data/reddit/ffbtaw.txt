Which for ETH is growing at an unsustainable rate. and since Vitalik doesn't consider decentralization to be of much importance I suspect that trend will continue.

Significantly reduces decentralization.

Moore's law isn't valid anymore, maintaining a full node will become prohibitively expensive within a few years and sharding is a substandard solution.

The number of people invested in said cryptocurrency.
If 1000 people make 10 transactions/day it is worth less than 10000 people making 1 transaction/day.

The lightning network can be layered on most cryptos, with ethereum though the growth of the blockchian does not depend on the additional layers, it will grow regardless.

I think you mean why should he care about decentralization.
And I agree he shouldn't if he justs wants to get rich, centralization is a sure fire pass to quick banking success.

The retracements we were getting in the last couple months haven't been happening. I think there'll be a correction in the next week to ~11k

Or perhaps he mined coins later that weren't obviously linked to him that he has sold.

It makes a little more sense if the ATH is 750, not 7500.

If Satoshi doesn't mine at the beginning then Bitcoin won't catch on. You could argue that he could have sent other people the coins later to encourage participation but he may have lost the private keys pretty early on, who knows. Also he is probably dead now so he did everyone a favor by reducing the total number that will ever be accessible.

Imagine being this dumb.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:29:39
I don't think 2% is unreasonable but I'd personally err on the side of 2.5% but that is partly due to location. General inflation doesn't matter as much as location specific inflation and spending habits.

Depends on so many factors, I've typically seen reported rates between 2-3% but on an individual basis it depends what you buy. I checked the CPI for Canada and food from supermarkets increased by 1.5% whereas restaurant prices increased by 2.9%. Of course it will be highly variable year-to-year.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:15:03
They may have the math to back up their predictions but four significant digits on a upper limit for how a high a price can go in the nebulous 'short term' is recklessly precise.
It would be fine to say that the price may surpass $7900 in the short term and eventually trade higher.

8.6 mos at current growth rate of 0.4%
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:20:24
If the average rate of growth is 0.42% per week she can get there in ~25 years (or at least very close &gt;0.99). That corresponds to a price of $1,400,000 USD/BTC by 2042.
