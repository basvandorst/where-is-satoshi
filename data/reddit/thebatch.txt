Does the buyer have any protection when doing cash deposit with localbitcoins or bitquick? What is stopping the seller from keeping the cash and not sending the bitcoin after the deposit is made? The seller controls the escrow right? Or are all 3 parties on the escrow?

I purchased 1 coin on Monday, funds pulled from my account on Thursday and 1 coin showed up in my Coinbase account this morning.

Yeah, I wonder how they flag it. I was a bit concerned after reading all the posts about issues - especially after prices went up $100 over the pending period. I did confirm my identity and used the login method to confirm my bank account rather than the test deposits (too impatient and wanted to buy). I haven't added a Visa card yet.

I made my first purchase this past Monday (11/4) at around $224 with a new Coinbase account. The expected delivery date was today (Friday). The charge to my bank account cleared yesterday and the coin showed up in my Coinbase account around 10am this morning with a price of around $325.

After reading all the posts on here about this, I was a bit concerned. I'm wondering how they flag people. However, my first purchase (for only 1 BTC) went through this week.
