@_date: 2017-08-01 13:46:56
They probably temporarily shut down because of the fork

What is replay protection? I've heard the term so many times but I never understood what it meant.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:00:41
The only way to solve a problem like this is a child pay for parent transaction but if that doesnt work, I dont know hot to help you buddy. I had the same issue but the CPFP worked for me. Good luck. :)
