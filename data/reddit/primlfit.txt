Adolf, that’s a super innacurate assessment. EVERYONE feels nervous investing any amount of money on any volatile/risky endeavor. I was nervous on my initial crypto buy and it was a small amount relative to income. People don’t belong in boxes, brother.

Buy some now, buy the rest when (IF) it drops at all. Most “drops” last a couple minutes tops. Don’t be the person who keeps waiting and waiting.

Sunday the 10th  then the 18th

LOL “destroyed by a bad software decision”. Do you have any clue how crypto functions? ��
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:16:07
No, every transaction takes time. Patience, brother.

These clickbait article titles are so cringeworthy.

I’ll never understand the odd notion that length of time on reddit equates to expertise regarding a specific subject. If reddit members are the primary authority on crypto we’re all fucked.

On the bright side, everyone is holding which people keep desperately asking for. ����

He stated it has been “stable”, this is not stability my man.

Redditor for 1 week here though, so my understand must be limited to 7 days. :(
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:57:18
IT HAS BEEN 1 HOUR, there is NO trend whatsoever. It’s as volatile as ever. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:38:45
Nobody knows, we haven’t had close enough time to determine the actual impact of today nor the 18th. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:58:27
LOL if that were you case you would only “lose money” if you bought higher than $5k and sold @ that price point. Shitpost.

This exact sentiment has been posted abouuuut 30x. 
The result of the futures may negatively impact price, positively, or have little to no change. Absolutely no one knows for a fact.

Why does everyone keep calling this a crash? Does anyone have a clue what constitutes a true crash? These comments are killing me haha

Many say less volatility. No one actually knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:50
Literally no one knows, it’s pure conjecture. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:48:52
Shitposting 101.

This question has been asked like 50 times a day the last two days. Just scroll through my man. 
“Buy some now, buy more IF there’s a dip. Spend what you can afford to lose” This point has be reiterated. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:18:44
Only if they ask you about hobbies, etc. Other than that, stick to information relevant to the position. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:44
You’re over 1k behind now, mate
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:47:20
These comments crack me up, man.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:38
Technically no one has seen anything like this in history my man. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:07:39
Damn, you must have 0 BTC and you’re living out some weird ass fantasy where you’re looking for praise. ����
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:49
This would be a drop/correction, not quite a crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:35:41
LOL these shot posts are excellentx
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:09:00
You have either missed the boat or have done absolutely zero due diligence regarding the technology. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:41:19
The community could most definitely influence fluctuations my man.

Coinbase, very easy for any beginner.
