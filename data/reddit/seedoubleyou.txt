$12, if you're interested.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:17:51
$12 to ship to EU, rulplefistbump.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:47:33
I'll gladly do this.
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:52:45
Actually, I think I may be able to work out a machining strategy. Give me a couple of days to get in my office and run some simulations to see if I can make it work.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:42:58
[That's why laser engraving is the best choice for this kind of project](
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:59:27
[This one work?](
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:02:37
I'll also take PayPal! lol
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:52:40
I can actually change the finish to Gold Alodine, if you're actually interested!
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:01:47
I can add a border if necessary.  No biggie!
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:53:26
[I'm totally doing this](
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:28:59
I'm working on getting one done, hopefully by 3PM today!
for all orders, add $4.50 for shipping internationally.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:43:08
I don't know what any of that means, but show me an example and I might be sold.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:50:03
Clear coat anodize (as opposed to clear paint) would increase the durability a lot.  Raw aluminum scratches like butter.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:21:31
Outstanding idea!
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:48:43
^This.  Otherwise, you'd fling your fixture out when it gets cut (with a .049" cutter, it'll just hop up enough to break your end mill and set you back $30)  Also, bandsaws don't leave a very appealing finish.  Metal splinters suck.

[The new style engraving works fine with every device tested](
If you'd like one, either PM me or email me your QR and text requirements.
I'll make the keychain and send you pictures of the final product, then you can send your payment and I'll ship ASAP.
I posted this thread yesterday, and boy, did it explode on me. I'm super excited that you guys like my work, and I'm beyond proud to be a productive member of the Bitcoin community.
I've got about 5x as many orders as I can handle at the moment, so forgive me if I'm a little slow responding. I'm out of stock right now, and I've got a little bit of a backlog going, so it may be a week or so before I can take any new orders.  I do have a massive shipment of blanks coming in soon.
If you'd like to order, you can email your order inquiries to see_Doubleyou and I'll take your info and get back to you when the stock comes in
For each order, I'll need: 
Bitcoin address you want engraved 
Text you want engraved, OR
Design, logo, whatever
An email address where I can contact you 
A shipping address 
Due to my not having a website at the moment, it'd be handy if you could list them out as noted above, to save me the time of sorting through it all.
[Example of the keychain](
[Example of the card](
As of now, all keychains are made of .060" thick aluminum sheet (there are minor abrasions on the back surface from shipping) anodized and engraved with your info. 
Business cards are a slimmer .030" thick, with a brush finish on the top side, also anodized and engraved.
Pricing is as follows:
$7.50 for a single sided tag with one QR address, and some text or a logo 
$10.00 for a double sided tag with a QR and text/logo 
$20.00 for a business card-sized (and shaped) plate with your info engraved on it 
$23.00 for a double sided business card
I can take BTC: 19B2wQZEQUQMTfoiRRvhWNTRuYYcMEeZNp
or PayPal: seedubarticles
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:51:25
It worked perfectly with my phone (iPhone barcode reader)
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:42:53
Before I send out any orders, I'll make sure the codes adhere to ISO standards, and are readable by as many devices as possible.
[this one]( seems to work with Coinbase for Android.  It seems I just needed to invert the engraving image.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:33:51
$7.50, subject to change.  Supply is somewhat limited.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:37:58
Awesome! Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:32:50
[Try this picture.](
See if that works.

@_date: 2013-12-09 04:47:51
How big do you want it? I'd say standard credit card size, probably. The sheet is ~0.03" thick
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:48:19
Email QR and text requirements to see_doubleyou and I'll get back to you ASAP.  I have a day job, so it might take a few hours for me to get back to you, but hang in there!!
EDIT: Commented on the top comment for visibility.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:00:18
Of course I'll add the quiet zone and border, just trying to see if it'll work on your android device before I go any further.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:47:37
Thought I had replied to all of them. In currently out of stock (waaaay more orders than I thought I'd get) Check back at [my website]( to keep up with my stock situation. PM me your email address!
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:56:20
[Yes, but is it ***metal***?](
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:55:06
$12 for shipping to Europe!  Email me at see_doubleyou to send me your info!
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:34:28
If it's black and white, I can do it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:28:50
Er...the email is see_doubleyou
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:54:12
They're made on a punch press, and anodized.  Then, the anodizing is lasered off by a, well, laser.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:21:12
I'd say .025 BTC at current market rate, maybe?
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:46:27
It seems I need to invert the image.  I'll get a new blank up so you can test it out.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:09:53
I offer a similar product, single orders, and the design is customizable. Prices will drop massively soon, as a production order is in the works.

@_date: 2013-12-09 04:06:11
This nameplate I made for myself is all I have at the moment, but the engraver will engrave any black and white image at roughly 500dpi.  
[terrible example](
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:55:39
[Oh, you mean like this?](
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:55:10
[Try this.](
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:04:25
I've never used wood fixtures before, but I have used tape to some success.
Ever use hot glue?  I used it to hold down some 3/16" thick material to a fixture plate while plowing through it in one pass with a 1/2" end mill.  I was shocked at how well it worked.  A few seconds on the hot plate and an acetone bath later, the part is clean as a whistle.  Added bonus: the fixture is pre-adhesived for the next go.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:28:34
Pieces are punch pressed, then anodized and the text/qr code is laser etched off.
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:50:18
Afraid knot.
Lol, I may be able to bend one out of brass and braze the ends together...not tok sure it would look very good. I might also see about getting one 3D printed for you if you're interested.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:55:24
That's what I'm hoping! :D
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:54:28
Whatever you can dream of.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:48:54
My phone reads it fine...
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:46:01
So would you be interested in one with the QR image inverted, so as to work on Coinbase for Android?
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:20:06
1.64" diameter, blue anodized aluminum. $7.50 sound fair?
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:46:29
[Or you can go with anodized aluminum.  Cheap, strong, and won't wear off unless you throw it in a bucket of rocks.](
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:12:34
Shouldn't take more than a week to ship all orders, if time permits.  27th should definitely not be an issue.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:54:54
Another strategy I've used is to screw down the main plate, and on the final cutout pass, leave .010-.005 of material at the bottom.  It's enough to hold most pieces when working with small end mills, and afterwards, you can just break them off.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:41:43
[Oh, like this?](
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:19:53
Yeah, unfortunately my day job and my children take the brunt of my time.  It's a miracle that I get anything done.  If you know of any web developers who would take BTC to design a simple yet functional website, let me know!
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:49:39
So do they typically have a single address the money is sent to, or does coinbase/bitpay change the address for every transaction?
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:34:17
10-4!  Just send me a PM with the details, and I'll make sure to get back with you.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:33:05
Black, red, blue, and gold, I believe.  I'll check on other anodize options to see if additional colors are available.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:39:49
Or whatever you can afford. I really don't know what to charge. Make an offer?
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:22:48
Market price on Mt. Gox is typically higher.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:41:23
[this one]( seems to work fine. Let me know.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:23:19
[might have been me.](
Mine are anodized aluminum, though. Very durable.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:45:45
email me with your QR and text requirements, and I'll send pictures before you post your payment, then I'll ship.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:52:32
I've got black, red, and blue anodized aluminum keychains/business cards  that I can laser engrave with your bitcoin data.
