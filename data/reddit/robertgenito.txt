what i'm saying is quite simple. just go re-read it.
@_date: 2016-04-05 03:20:52
Before answering the questions, I'd like to point out: yes, you *could* be making an error in analysis. I only say this because you have to know what you're looking for. If you're looking at small orders of $10 then you're more likely to see them having a combined fee—seller fee and Wall of Coins (WOC) fee—of around 11%-14% depending on another market's reported price, unless the buyer has bought consistently from us for a period of time. If people don't like paying $1.10 to the seller and WOC for a service that is swift, the fastest turn around time on the planet for cash payments, and the easiest service to use, then that's OK. We're here to make things as easy as possible while supporting our infrastructure and paying local, living wages.
Also, thank you for taking the time to type up the questions above. Here's the best answers for a quick type-up:
* What is the mark-up or "organic fee" for a first time buyer? And for an average buyer? That depends on many variables, including the amount they are purchasing. The amount they are purchasing is priced with a formula that we do not intend to release, as the formula's intention is to give us a competitive advantage in certain contexts. Sorry! As a basic rule of thumb, you will always receive more of a discount when you are buying more bitcoin, and the fees get lower the more you use our service. The formula also takes into account user-based discounts, country discounts, and discounts specifically for certain payment methods that we are promoting or looking to get more people to try (for example, through our Money Gram billers). The first time buyer's fee to the seller is always what the seller wants--whether it is a fixed price or a dynamic/formulaic pricing model. The first time buyer's fee to WOC is always higher than the returning customer--unless we are running a special promotion.
* How can buyers determine what their organic fee paid is? I'll admit, it's not easy at the moment. As more people use our service—although no one has asked for this yet—I do see it being valuable information. I will bring this back up with team when we compile new features for development. In our original design, we did not believe this to be useful in the buyer's decision of whether to buy from us or not, and we have research that shows this: if the price is lower than another market, then that's all most buyers care about. However, to determine the organic fee paid, in some cases you can find out by looking at the bitcoin transaction itself that delivered your coins. Alternatively, you have to know which offer you received on the order book--while generally it is the lowest offer, it could be the 2nd to lowest offer depending on your volume needs, or a combination of the 2 offers if you selected a "Best Value" offer.
Our goal with Wall of Coins was to keep things extremely simple and secure. We didn't wish to bombard new-comers with unnecessary numbers because that has proven to be a factor inhibiting adoption. We are hyper focused on marketing bitcoin adoption to people with little to no previous experience in the space, and the seasoned bitcoin veterans are smart enough to figure out how our system works. As stated, we conducted a ton of research while writing the design document for Wall of Coins to determine the easiest way possible to acquire and sell bitcoin, and this research--along with the advice of our lead security analyst--dictated how we would design the system and experience. We are a market maker where people buy lower than a price relative to another market and where people buy higher than a price relative to another market. In a world where there's more buyer demand, then naturally there is more buying pressure and prices go higher. Instant bitcoin with cash is proven as valuable...and that's just the reality of the world we live in. This is our style: instead of saying, "You're paying a total of $100 for X bitcoin, where technically you would pay $96 at some other arbitrary market for the same bitcoin, $2 to the seller, and $2 to WOC.", we opted to be different and simplify it by saying, "you're getting $100 for X bitcoin." Plain and simple, and ultimately the only figure that a buyer cares about.
* How can sellers determine what organic fees their buyers are paying? You'd have to link up the transaction with the orders in your history. This question is the same for bigger institutional markets: how does the seller determine which tier the buyer was on and what fee they paid exactly? I don't know of a single market where you can tell this... and I'd wager that the markets did not have their development staff implement this feature for the same reason we haven't: it's not in demand. In the end, all sellers care about is whether their coins sell. The less work they have to do for their coins to sell, and the more liquid their coins are, the better the experience. Wall of Coins excels here, and our sellers are happy with our service and extremely loyal.
* How does an organic fee differ from a hidden fee? It depends on how you wish to look at it--it's all perspective. Are chain grocery stores charging a "hidden fee" because they don't tell you how much they make from the wholesale price? Are all of us (bitcoin exchanges) being dishonest when we say the current price of bitcoin is $420.40 USD when the buyer actually paid MORE to get the bitcoin after you include fees, incoming wire fees, etc? I'm more of an optimist, and I would say that we're all just looking to make the experience less confusing and as easy to understand as possible. If you're looking to spend $440 (or even $4,400) on acquiring bitcoin and you see that Wall of Coins will give you the most bitcoin for your buck, obviously you'll use Wall of Coins. The opposite is also true, unless the other source (market) is just too difficult to figure out how to navigate and operate.
* Do you consider this transparent? If we weren't transparent, would you have even known to ask these questions? Our 100% transparency refers to our bitcoin deposit addresses—you can make a watch-only wallet of our entire operations. This is a huge step up from any bitcoin exchange—from my knowledge, even after 18 months of solid operation—Wall of Coins is still the only exchange that practices this.
* So I'm wondering whether I'm making a methodolical error in analyzing your transparent market, or whether you are actively misleading people about fee sizes by about a factor of ten? Honestly, from experience I know that there are many opportunities where things can be misunderstood. For example, is the number that you're looking at both the compiled seller fee and WOC fee? It would have to be. Considering our website does not yet have literature on this difficult to communicate topic, I think it's fair and easy to rule out and say that we are NOT actively misleading anyone. Our philosophy is basically: does the buyer see an attractive price? Then by all means, buy it before someone else does! Don't see an attractive price? Check out another service. We understand that these situations exist in these purely demand driven markets.
In closing, there's a reason why most people continue to use Wall of Coins: we take customer feedback very serious, we're constantly updating our service to reflect this, we apparently have the best security practices in the industry (this was our intention, regardless of how expensive it is), and we make an effort to hear and communicate with our customers—we are still the only exchange with a toll free number for customers. I think we should definitely release an API that specifies any dynamic premium prices, as well as determines an easy way for buyers to determine what fee amounts they are paying to the seller and WOC. Likewise, these questions and answers will be brought up in our next feature meeting. Thank you again for taking the time to look into our service, comment, and ask!

We don't have a normal markup... our system utilizes a technology that we call "organic fee". Basically, 1) any fee we charge is built into the pricing to get your coin, 2) the more you spend, the lower your fee, and 3) Wall of Coins does not always collect a fee--it all depends on the reputation of the buyer and our ability to fulfill our promise.
Examples: the other day someone bought $6000 worth of bitcoin. Wall of Coins collected a fee of 0.6%. Another large order of $1000, and Wall of Coins collected a pretty high fee of 1.3%.
Wall of Coins is the fastest place to get bitcoin on the planet. I hear bitquick is pretty quick with their 3 hours order fulfillment time. Then I guess we're pretty quick with our 5-15 minutes! thank you for asking!

Well first of all, I had to rid myself of the attitude that "i'm some dirty hippy and no one wants my bitcoin". That attitude is guaranteed to turn people off. And i'm serious: I had this somewhat anxious feeling about asking other people. As soon as I stopped caring and put off more positive energy about this, and by "put off more positive energy" i mean that I approached people with enthusiasm, things began to change and turn around.
So far I've helped local companies get a bitcoin wallet and allow me to pay them with Bitcoin. Sure, some people are weirded out...but those aren't the types of businesses that I want to pay anyways :P

tl;dr version: multisig is not the only solution. the only steps are forward.
Multisig is good, eliminating a theoretically rare and highly probably edge case scenario where Wall of Coins runs off with people's coin or business becomes entirely un-operational and unprofitable for anyone to step up into. There are no problems with multisig, other than they add another layer of friction that restricts new-coming to acquire and liquidate coin.
My thoughts on 2/3 multisig is that it loses its value when you're working with a centralized *publishing* avenue to find your goods/services (such as WallofCoins.com). *Obviously* the buyer always has their maximum of 1 vote. Obviously the seller always has their maximum 1 vote as well. This leaves Wall of Coins with the final vote anyways, should the seller become unresponsive. Multisig value is only lost at convenience: no newcoming buyer is going to know how to use it at today's technological convenience.
I know that will change eventually, but I am working on a solution that does not involve multisig, and I believe it will simulate it and guarantee its extra trust (with buyer and seller's combined effort to release the coins)...*without* the seller and buyer *both* needing technical knowledge.
Plans to support multisig? Absolutely.
Plans to support "get your coins even if Wall of Coins doesn't agree"? This feature will come first :)
I hear "bitrated" is working on a system to make multisig transparent and easy for everyone. I really want to know more about this. Wall of Coins' purpose is convenience for everyone, and that comes at a price until the technological means have been developed and are aligned with Wall of Coins' values: convenience, security, and easy of use for the layman.

Nah, you definitely haven't tried this with people. I've approached over 10 businesses about accepting bitcoin and downloading a wallet. Only 1 has refused. "Merchant" account is needed for people that continue to use an old payments model ; with Bitcoin, you don't need a merchant...you only need a way to liquidate coins for the moment you want to. If you're a company holding only $50 in bitcoin, and you *really* need those funds or else you're going to go bankrupt, then true: the business shouldn't consider accepting bitcoin. However, if the business isn't hurting for that $50, it's worth it. Make sense? :D
For liquidation, that's where easy services like wallofcoins.com comes in. You don't need a merchant account; you just need a place to liquidate.

Your question was "How do I access my bitcoin when I have, for example, no access to an internet connection". It would've been better for me to answer, "use the internet connection of the person you're paying." This all goes back to "transactability":
* how do you use the ATM when their connection is down? You don't; the ATM has the same limitation.
* how do you access your money from a branch if their network system is down? You don't; they have the same limitation.
* how do you access your bitcoin when your internet connection is down and the cafe's free wifi is down? You don't.
* how do you access cash in your pocket when the whole world's internet is down? You reach in your pocket.
...etc, etc...
I know you can figure out what I'm saying. I'll use the format as well: "A _____ cannot spend your ____ without a connection to the _____ network".
* "A **device** cannot spend your **bitcoin funds** without a connection to the **bitcoin** network."
* "A **merchant** cannot spend your **credit/banking card funds** without a connection to the **processing** network."
Once again, this is about transactability, and because both systems will fail if they do not have a connection with some network, then both systems have this issue. If you're buying something online and paying in bitcoin, then guess what? Bingo! You have a connection to the internet! If you're at a mom-and-pop cafe shop that accepts bitcoin, then guess what? They will have wifi for you if they want you to be able to give them bitcoin ;) If their wifi is down, then you can at least broadcast the transaction yourself. You're not stuck, like in the situation where the payment processing network (or the store's connection) is down.
If you're at a restaurant and their connection to their payment network is down--and this happened to me just last week--then you're just going to have to wait. Unlike with the bitcoin world, you don't have the option to process the credit/debit/bank card transaction *for* them on your mobile phone's connection to the payment network.
This goes back to my original comment: Bitcoin definitely has "high" transactability, while USD is moderate and lacking in areas.

Well this is a good point. And yes, if I refuse USD cash, then i basically turned down the client. I don't turn down the client, but I *do* refuse to accept paypal, credit card, and out-of-state checks. Chances are that my company gets paid from an existing customer with bitcoin. But if they still haven't jumped on the band waggon, they'll need to go to my bank and deposit cash.
So the alternative for them is: go to the bank to deposit cash and get themselves some bitcoin ... 
Besides that, the market we go after has most people dealing with bitcoin anyways (we service bitcoin miners and develop software / web services for companies looking to work with bitcoin).

I do want to add that this is something I meditated on for over 2 years. around 4-6 months ago it was decided to abandon formulaic pricing. This also complicates things for your average and "new" coin user ... one of the largest goals of WallofCoins.com is to make acquiring and liquidating coins as accessible as possible and as friction-free as possible. For example, this is a huge problem with entering and exiting the Bitcoin ecosystem today: there is a ton of friction and learning curve for the common means to acquire or liquidate coins. We want to change that, and WallofCoins.com is a young manifestation.

@_date: 2014-10-16 10:04:12
As much as I hate talking about LocalBitcoins.com, go find a reputable seller on LocalBitcoins.com , and request information about them to do a background check on them.
Your quickest option is probably using cash-based services like BitQuick.co and WallofCoins.com
While hey, you may have to work a little for it... but that's why Bitcoin is valuable and not a walk in the park. Think of it like this: work hard and you'll end up making the best out of it ... avoiding a situation where you get screwed or pay *way* too much of a price for the coins :)

The only thing that makes USD a successful tool is the fact that it will legally disolve debt between you and someone you are in debt to. That's all. Before this, all currencies that popped up in the USA basically failed.

I promise to fix once banks in the UK are supported! Then again, I'd rather license the code to someone in the UK who really loves and cares about people having an easy way to get coins.
Oh...do you have a google voice line? That may be an option.

Heya thank you for asking. As I said earlier, I still need to exchange some of my coins for US dollar. I only need to do this because not everyone in the world accepts bitcoin yet. What happens is I'll have a good chunk of my *DEBIT* card (sorry, earlier I was just general and stated "credit card"). When bitcoin is for a good price that I cannot refuse, I'll take some of my extra cash out of the bank and go get some coin.
Hope that's clearer :)
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:44:30
Having a debit card has nothing to do with personal responsibility. It's about a lost opportunity for the business. Eat it!

tl;dr ... Thank you for this input. Who else does all 4 of these features, or even just 3 of them? No one.
Here's what we're doing differently:
* Wall of Coins is 100% transparent -- all of our deposit addresses are published, on separate servers, and GPG signed by 2 companies.
* We are the *only* service where we select a professional building *near your location* where you can obtain Bitcoin.
* There are no extra costs: what you see is what you get, and the bitcoin and USD rate you select as a seller is exactly how much cash you get!
* Furthermore, we protect buyers and sellers from scammers, which is a huge problem today. You will *never* hear of a buyer or seller being scammed on Wall of Coins, yet you hear this constantly on services like Local Bitcoins. This protection comes from the distance we keep between buyers and sellers, similar to a traditional market.
Who else does all 4 of these, or even just 3 of them? No one.
Once other development features of ours are rolled out, we'll continue to have distinct, special features that no one else has; other platforms will have to play catch up. We're fine with this, because want to directly inspire all competing networks to change and adopt.

...probably like 10,000 BTC :) edit: but damn, i shouldn't smile :(
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:41:44
For those that missed the private invitation, here are some photos taken by a fan :D
We're all very excited about the public release, too... Wall of Coins can serve people without the need for a user account. Just as another recent service has said (forgive me, I forget the name): "No need for a user account: The way markets should be." And I agree: imagine if you needed an account to shop at the grocery store?
As for before, Wall of Coins was *never* online as a "beta" version. We've spent significant time on automated testing to cover a more-than-healthy portion of the code base to deliver an overall smooth experience...even for people privately using the site :)
@_date: 2014-09-20 06:44:33

...how do you have access to your USD when there is no internet connection? unless you have physical cash on you, you don't. Edit: in the age we live in today, USD, EUR, Bitcoin, etc. *ALL* depend on the internet's infrastructure for the common person to transact.

Oh I agree. Unfortunately, your newbie doesn't know (and probably will not read) the best practices :/
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:01:53
"Easily Transactable" should be moderate: USD is not easy to transact. I could sit here and make a table itself showing why USD is moderately "transactable", but basically, the more money you have, the harder it is to spend on whatever you want, whenever you want. Considering with Bitcoin you *always* have access to your money, and you can *always* transact it where ever and when ever, Bitcoin definitely has "high" transactability, while USD is moderate and lacking in areas.

The employer keeps BTC on hand for a very good reason. Bitcoin is a growing economy, and as Bitcoin's market cap scales and expands...guess what happens to the company? The company also scales and expands :)
So year after year, for each BTC company that has kept their holdings in BTC, that company has grown with Bitcoin. Imagine being a small company with only $4000 in holdings (all in Bitcoin savings), and the month is Oct 2013 when the price was about ... I don't remember... $120 ? In today's market ($360 per BTC) your company's holdings JUST GREW 300% ... without ANY work or effort!
And going from Oct 2013 to December 2013, your company's value basically grew 10X, all because the company decided to hold in something that would only appreciate in value over time. Basically, the employer who keeps BTC on hand for the long term is an intelligent employer, and you should work for him.
@_date: 2014-10-17 02:56:15
Further more, if you hold more than $10k in foreign assets, I heard that you need to report that. Bitcoin will probably be considered a foreign asset in the future. Who knows. I do know that declaring it as real estate was surprising ... And kind of lazy considering bitcoin is its own thing.
@_date: 2014-10-17 16:24:37
Well, the response you received is definitely true.
@_date: 2014-10-03 13:13:21
Ty...I really appreciate the request.
Similar to how Bitstamp never offered formulaic pricing in the past based on Mt GOX, WallofCoins.com will *never* offer formulaic pricing. We are not a broker-direct service...this is an entirely new, different market. While non-formulaic selling isn't attractive to all sellers, we're taking a bet that sellers will find WallofCoins.com's other qualities very sexy: *ZERO* fee, funds available for immediate withdrawal/use, saving the seller a ton of time in general, etc.
Btw: 
@_date: 2014-10-08 18:49:14
Where's the proof though? I'm having a hard time finding it on there page... And the only thing I have found so far is that people are trusting that their code is the same as their deployed code, and that their figures are correct that they post on a frequent basis.
This doesn't seem like fully transparency to me ... this is why Wall of Coins posts ALL of our deposit addresses: you can see everything going on at any given moment.
Let me know if I missed something on coin port. I've been checking them out for a little bit so far.
@_date: 2014-11-30 21:38:10

@_date: 2014-10-18 01:03:46
Ok now you two... you can get along :) Frankly, claiming that the US Dollar has "low-volatility" isn't very accurate. US Dollar is, frankly, also volatile. Is the price of bitcoin going up? or is the price of USD going down? Is the price of USD going up? Or is the price of BTC going down? Either way it doesn't matter: you're always going to find someone desperate enough to sell their BTC for much lower than it's true value simply because it is not as widely accepted as USD. With BTC acceptance continually rising, this isn't a problem.
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:37:58
Furthermore, the "cash market" world that wants to acquire Bitcoin will pay a slightly higher price. Why? Because they get the coins instantly. My business has been doing this for a while when we've needed USD. If you're liquidating, get some extra percentage points by selling through a cash-based system such as Wall of coins... 
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:26:52
just about as exciting as having an online bank account :D wait, i already have a couple of those...
@_date: 2014-10-16 09:51:37
man are you serious? ok i'll be fair...coinbase is *at least* an option. if the person has an iphone: get bread wallet (  ), if the person has an android, get Hive Wallet from the play store ... or, there's also  for other devices.
After that, find someone locally or use a cash-based service such as  to get some coins.

Eh, a dumb move on his part was possessing marijuana in a state that would rather you be dead than smoke grass.
It's unfortunate that a normal citizen has to worry about using too much electricity. If you're worried about this, you may as well consider using a miner hosting service such as hashingplex.com ; at least it wouldn't have drawn attention to the point where his bitcoins were confiscated. Because the reality is: cops will confiscate your cash, and you must prove that you obtained them legally .. and unfortunately, proving this in court will likely cost you more money than the value confiscated... =\
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:22:14
So at this point you should learn to *call* them first. This is what I do: if they no longer accept bitcoin, changes are they simply do not have a wallet. Ask whether they have iPhone or an android. If iPhone, tell them to download "bread wallet". Problem solved! They now accept Bitcoin once again!
And if they don't want Bitcoin, they're probably hurting for cash. Talk with the manager or owner, and kindly let them know that they just lost your business. Accepting Bitcoin is not hard, and losing a Bitcoin customer is easy.

still a horrible idea to store your private key with another company.

Basically, servers do not store *anything* that runs on the client-side, unless their client-side software sends the data to the server. Client-side code *only* runs locally on the user's computer.

While you're right, you're also not seeing the positive: it's an opportunity for me to *save*, spend less, and be happier when the price goes up. But here's some good information I think you should know about living off bitcoin:
Have at least a week's worth of cash to live off of. You never know: you might lose your bitcoin spending wallet (just like you might lose your physical wallet).
I'm guessing you ask because you don't prepare for the future, or prepare for a week ahead of time ... if this is the case, you might want to consider that :)

The same that artificial intelligence* has to do with parallel parking your car for you: do you need it? no. is it useful depending on the circumstance? yes.
Concerning cash deposits where many people are selling their Bitcoin across 11 banks with over 32,000 locations in the USA ... where sellers often have multiple bank accounts ... *and* considering these sellers are all selling at different rates, have different amount of bitcoin that they're selling, have different minimum purchase requirements, etc ... do buyers want to look at all of this information? No, but they will if they need to.
Instead, Wall of Coin's determines which cash deposit options are best for you and **available** to you, which are most convenient, and which give you the best deal, etc. Our algorithms solve many problem that the user doesn't have to solve, which limits the friction involved in obtaining bitcoin. There are many benefits; all out of the sake of convenience and making things simple and direct for the buyer!

Good question. While this turns into a huge web of a flow chart diagram, here are the basics: All coins are held *entirely* in cold storage. When you vouch to buy coins, you're asked to either SMS text reply with a code to verify once you've made the payment, or text reply with a code to cancel your purchase. My team members (or myself for when things get too busy!) fight for your coin's release.
If you're a seller, you receive a text message when the buyer makes the payment. If their deposit is correct, you SMS text a verification. If the deposit is not correct, or is missing, you text reply with a different code. I could literally write a book about this...and already have in our internal docs. I should release them:)

I don't know about the internals of Blockchain.info, but it really depends on how your private key is generated. If it is generated from some API, then they still have access (and in some way hold) your private key.
However, if you generate your private key on the front-end (client-side Javascript), then Blockchain.info does *not* have your private key...unless they have another javascript call send the private key to their back end. I'm sure they wouldn't do this, because many hackers would call them out on it :)

Besides the obvious points to remain silent and not give them permission to search your car, here are some important things to know:
Regardless of your race, your bitcoins would have been stolen anyways. Same with cash: any cash you had could have been stolen anyways. Basically, by obviously enforceable law now, any and all cash on you can be seized, and you must prove where you legally obtained the cash before you will get it back. And btw, you're going to spend WAY more cash on lawyer fees just *trying* to get the money back.
Moral of the story? You did the right thing. Just give it to him. Next: password protect your paper wallet. If they ask for the password, it is simply written down somewhere else. And they can go f* themselves :)
@_date: 2014-10-03 14:21:55
Fight: no fighting really. It's more accurate to say that we want people to buy coins, and we're working in the best interest to get everyone their coins ASAP.
Scam seller: it's definitely not in the seller's interest to do this, especially when you could have a police report written up and a detective looking for ya. At first, let's take the benefit of the doubt that you (as a seller) legitimately believe you did not receive the deposit. Does the buyer's receipt look legit? Does the photo forensics imagery look legit? Did the buyer perform our request on the receipt and respond in a responsible manner? (These are only in high-suspicion zones.) If we believe the receipt looks legitimate, it is then in the seller's best interest to clear this quickly (for the sake of time). If that is rated closer to "trustworthy", now what is the seller's response? Willing to get on the phone with their bank? Etc. In the end, even though it's still an area of caution: it's not hard to prove whether or not a deposit was made by the buyer. If we must spend the resources as a company to dig deeper into an issue, that's simply our duty to serve our users.
I understand this does not fully explain, as mentioned earlier this quickly "...turns into a huge web of a flow chart diagram". If you'd like to give it a try being a scam seller, you're more than welcome to really experience our procedures and policies :)

Really, I meant that the term can be misleading. By definition of the word "address", it would be more suitable to say, "Here is a bitcoin key of mine. You can pay me by sending coins to this key!" This doesn't mean that bitcoin "address" doesn't work as a good metaphor, but it does confuse people new to crypto currency, as they already have presumptions about what an "address" is from terms like "email address" (which never changes), "home address" (which only changes when you move), etc.

@_date: 2016-03-23 18:21:39
point was that calling it an "address" is misleading. No wonder so many "consumers" are confused about what a "confirmation" is and commonly ask why their bitcoin "address" is always changing.... ;) I'd say basement-dwelling nerds that you put down are the individuals who came up with the term "address", but that's fine...I mean no disrespect to them.

Check out the proof of reserves for Wall of Coins:  ,  ... I think everyone should do it like this: offer a "watch only" wallet of all reserves. If they're using someone else's address, they get publicly called out. These would be addresses given to customers.
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:58:18
"and don't touch our servers unencrypted" -- so basically, your servers still have sufficient private keys to spend. I've read the site, I understand it, and I understand how to implement this as I've implemented it with the team from our own company. My statement still stands that creating private keys on a website is NEVER full proof that the customer is in total control.

@_date: 2016-06-05 20:43:16
This remains unanswered and hidden from general viewing in a deep thread:
well, [for Coinbase] to "compare hashes", you'll have to either 1) make your hashing method publicly known, or 2) send the password to the backend via HTTPS to keep the hashing method private. You've gotta weakness either way. Solution: do not share 1 key with the end user. That's an easy tweak to get the "most secure and resilient solution", don't you think?
@_date: 2016-06-05 20:39:46


This is terrible logic at it's best. This is like saying no fees equals dishonesty. Our service charges no fees those holding and selling bitcoin...and some days we do promotions where there are zero fees for everyone. what's so dishonest about that? If your service really sucks so you work hard to attract more volume, you're not going to be able to service that volume when you get a bunch of big buyers or big sellers unless there's an equilibrium of supply/demand.... and in a finite world where bitcoin is in high demand and low supply, that doesn't exist.....
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:41:48
*sigh*, yup.... you're right... can't believe that there are still only 2 exchanges that have proof of reserves. Technically, these 2 places are called "markets", and only 1 of them is online.

I have nothing to prove. i know luke, and he's been involved in the bitcoin industry longer than coinbase themselves, so for you to say "Do you know anything about the business world, Luke?" is pure disrespect, and there's no reason for you to be that way. Grow up.
@_date: 2016-06-09 04:56:29
1) Are you kidding? No where there am I suggesting to have "security by obscurity", and that has nothing to do with hashing. So far, people are storing coins in coinbase's multisig "vault" and apparently your hash method is known. Since this is public information--which it shouldn't--that will be a shit storm when your database leaks. Even just to think that won't happen with your data is worrisome. This combination is horribly dangerous for your end users who store bitcoin with the hopes to forget about it. If this is what Coinbase is doing, then they're not the "most secure" solution, and their marketing is deception.
2) Of course that's silly...that was my point. That's the only way Coinbase could keep the hashing/salting of passwords non-public, but that very compromise gives Coinbase access to 2 of the 3 keys. So if Coinbase does the responsible thing and doesn't make their hashing/salt methods public, then Coinbase ultimately has access to the 2nd key that they're claiming to not have access. If this is what's happening, I see you agree that this is ALSO not the "most secure" solution, and is a form of deception on Coinbase's part.
I understand you're likely a developer and not a security analyst, so to follow up with what you don't understand, I hope to clarify with this: the better solution, if Coinbase's service wants to claim that they're the "most secure" solution, is to have Coinbase hold 1 key and ONLY 1 key. The end user should have complete control, exclusive over the other 2 keys. If they don't, or they possibly don't, then Coinbase's multisig vault is not the "most secure", and calling it so is a deception on Coinbase's part.
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:52:59
Sure, I got it. Did my comment make sense? :)
@_date: 2016-06-05 20:35:52
Why is the company even calling coinbase multisig the "most secure solution" when it's obviously not and better solutions knowingly exist? (Trezor, CoPay, etc) This is another form of deception on coinbase's part.
@_date: 2016-06-02 01:25:32

@_date: 2016-06-03 17:44:27
I'm logged in. I click "create your vault" -- nothing happens. Besides, creating private keys on a website is NEVER full proof that the customer is in total control of the private key, and your company damn well knows this. So to pretend that it's the answer is also another form of deception.
@_date: 2016-06-03 22:23:43
The verbiage on Coinbase's website makes it sound like Coinbase *does* have sufficient keys on the service. In the 3 key example, it says that 1 is stored with Coinbase, the 2nd is SHARED with Coinbase (and the user) and encrypted using the password on Coinbase's end. No matter how you try to cleverly craft these words, it boils down to Coinbase having both private keys.
"We built the most secure and resilient solution possible." -- if Coinbase really wants the "most secure" solution possible, they will not have a "shared key". This is dishonest marketing hype at best.
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:46:16

    Hi Kacper,
    
    We’re preparing the transaction for you. Let me clear up any more
    miscommunication. You remember BitPay had fallen to an email scam
    --the advice of our lead security analyst was to treat this with
    caution for many reasons. One of the main reasons being that
    communication from you was so sparse and limited.
    
    These precautions are not un-reasonable, wouldn’t you say? I’m not
    saying this is at all your fault, and I truly believe we could’ve
    handled things better. I apologize that it had to come down to this,
    as I’m a huge fan of your site, consider you a friend, and
    sponsorship was solely because we greatly appreciate your website.
    You’ll have the payment within 30-40 minutes.
    
    All of us at Wall of Coins would appreciate it if you could have a
    banner up on your site letting your visitors know that this was
    settled.

Why are you avoiding posting the GPG-signed response? If anything, I'd hope the public could see that you are being dishonest without supplying GPG proof.
@_date: 2016-02-18 22:15:33
For everyone's information, this is the GPG key Kacper and I have used in the past to verify our emails to one another, and this is the GPG key we are expecting to have a signed message with, proving that it is Kacper.

    Thank you. I’m glad to see that everything is still OK.
    
    As for the bitcoin address and dollar amount—or this email—I’m waiting for this to be posted on Bitcoinity.org and the reddit thread (linked below). This is to inform your viewers and the public that this was paid. Things did not have to come to this, and I wish you would’ve talked with us instead of allowing several weeks to go by in between communication. For the sake to undo any unnecessary damage to Wall of Coins’ image and reputation, I’d also request that you keep this address posted on Bitcoinity.org for at least 1 week with a “Thank you WallofCoins.com !” message once you’ve received the payment.
    
    Let me know if you have any questions, and feel free to contact me over Skype or Google talk if that is convenient. All lines of communication are open.

    Heya Kacper,
    
    I know you’re a good guy, and you would not attempt to promote a bad image to your users for whom you’ve labeled as your largest sponsorship supporter: Wall of Coins  — especially with the public not aware of our communication.
    
    The fact that you’ve posted this public is good—my intentions and Wall of Coins intentions have always been 100% transparency—and I believe this can help us easily resolve the locked problem of your verification and our payment to you. Our efforts and intentions with you to resolve this have been clear in the past. Being that we have not received responses from you, besides about 2 moments on Google Talk and 1 email from your Google Email since November, we also take security very seriously, and want to make sure this is indeed a request authorized by yourself to the appropriate bitcoin address of payment, and that no security breaches have occurred to your accounts within the last 24 hours. If this was authorized by you, please accept our security measure with appreciation.
    
    I have no hard feelings in my heart, and based on our relationship, I feel it is likely that is also true for you. I’d appreciate a response signed with your GPG signature including the amount of bitcoin due as well as the bitcoin destination address. If you did post the banner on bitcoinity.org, I would also appreciate that you publicly post on every location that includes the “PSA: Wall of Coins" banner a fresh, new bitcoin payment address, including the amount of bitcoin to pay, to where we are to send payment. Please also include this bitcoin amount and address in your GPG-signed response so we have security knowing that this is a legitimate request. Under those conditions, Wall of Coins will pay the bitcoin address the amount you ask for by the end of today. Thank you!

    Seriously? You want me to thank you for 4 months delay in the payment?
    This is exactly why I did the announcement.
    
    I can confirm publicly on reddit that you did the payment when you do
    it. In case I would deny you have an e-mail signed by me with the
    bitcoin address (actually, many of them).

accounts is still unclear if we owe you for 1 month, and the lack of responses from you does not make it easy for us to resolve this quickly. i've attempted to communicate with you but you haven't responded. seeing this message coming from another account is a good thing. at this point, i say we unite together and become an example to the bitcoin community with transparency. I will send a copy of this to your email. Hope all is OK over there.

Honestly, my life is the same. I do not let fear, greed, or money control me.

How so? Is it unreasonable that the company (Genitrust) policy requires a GPG signature or phone verification for bitcoin payments &gt;$3000? He was paid once this policy was met, so how is that scammish? For all we know, someone could've hacked his email account and demanded a large sum of bitcoin be sent.

As you can see, LBC has issues. It's a great site to reach people, ask about bitcoin, develop a little bit of a relationship, maybe meet them for coins, etc. I'll give LBC that, which they excel in. If you're looking to sell bitcoin, give WallofCoins.com a try for selling your coins. FYI, I am part of the Wall of Coins project, so I might be biased.

@_date: 2015-04-12 09:19:32
this depends on the number of machines you have, or the number of "clients" hashing. Look up the "stratum" protocol, and you can find out about how much bandwidth each client will consume.
@_date: 2015-04-17 17:54:58
do you mean that LBC doesn't have reviews? it seems like everyone trusts that site, but who knows.

To be fair, regardless of the service you use to obtain bitcoin, even though the "fee percentage" is a number you're not happy with, a lot of times these alternative places to get bitcoin DEFINITELY beat the fees involved when you consider sending wire transfers, receiving wires, the time just to setup an account, etc.

Well, you have a good question: "how do we combat this bs?" First, realize what is happening: whether these articles or tv *programs* are right or wrong, it doesn't matter. Their goal is to alter the consciousness of human thought. The more people that believe something, the more that society considers it true. The only way to combat it is to know what you're talking about, and spread the word to everyone you know.
My response: the internet is used for terrorism, too. Yet we kept the internet.

Hi InfinitelyOutThere, really appreciate you making this post :) And I look forward to your review! Take care!
@_date: 2015-11-27 16:51:10
Well, apparently your step father is smarter than you give him credit for ;)

I see. Well this makes sense. Apparently you don't have to actually be trustworthy: you only have to "sell" people on trust by having a flashy About Us page. Considering this works, I thank you for mentioning this and siting some links, and I'll make sure an "About Us" page in the future doesn't try to go against the norm. Much appreciated!
Here's the best I can do to thank you: here are some useful links to help you determine the effort that a company has gone through to be open, rather than being sold by their flashy web design:
*  -- find information about who's running the web services. Check if they're using an anonymous service or "privacy guard".
*  -- Search for Florida entities by name.
*  -- for California companies.
*  -- for finding "businesses, brands and charities they can trust".
*  -- type in the owner's name, see if they have some sort of social presence.
*  -- see if they have a personal website. Here's my website on my drumming career, right before I entered the bitcoin world which consumed me: 
*  -- educate yourself about PGP / GnuPG. You can download my GPG key from almost any key server... the key fingerprint ID is "CD14CD15", has my company email, when I created the key, other people who have signed my key, etc.
Also, look at the SSL certificate of the company. While this also isn't perfect, it's a good place to look. Here's a diagram:

hehe good one. I guess we could dynamically tell users outside of our supported countries, "get in touch so we can support your country!"

marcmerica wow, i *really* appreciate this. Thank you :) I really look forward to seeing InfinitelyOutThere's response, so I'll be keeping an eye on this!
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:55:13
...not for much longer! But pretty much yes. Is there a country you'd like us to bring this to?
@_date: 2015-10-10 19:13:40
yea, but why the hell would you support a company that doesn't support bitcoin?

Hi Digital,
My name is Robert Genito, and I am the project leader for Wall of Coins. We're *extremely* open about who we are. Not only can you find our facebook, twitter, instagram, etc:
* we have a GeoTrust Extended SSL certificate. Not just anyone can get one of these, and your identity must be published and verified. It is not easy to get one of these. 
* Our business is in the better business bureau
* you can find information about our company "Genitrust, Inc" on sunbiz.org
* our "whois" information does *not* use privacy guard: all of the business's consistent information is on our "whois" domain information.
* We have a toll free number. Give me an example of 1 bitcoin site with a toll free number, and you won't find one.
* Our system is 100% transparent, meaning that we have published all of our bitcoin deposit addresses:  ... NO single bitcoin service has done this.
So if this is "shy" to you, then apparently we're the least shy bitcoin business the world has to offer :D

Which would you have rather had... the short, temporary experience of an "8th of weed", or 500 BTC? You (and we all) know the answer :)
@_date: 2016-05-01 17:31:04
duh. it's a good way to keep the company not profitable, thus no taxes to be paid. that's what i'm exposing.
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:41:38
Thanks Rudayb, i'm glad it helped :)
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:16:49
247CryptoNews ... how about your news campaign tones it down on attacking the people who literally have the whole world of the bitcoin protocol on their shoulders? Be appreciative, or code it yourself, or fund it yourself. Jerk.

then the scammer just opens another account and repeats the scam =\ there's nothing for LBC to freeze when the scammer leads the transaction outside of the trade. I've studied this recently and have exercised putting people in this weaker position. Of course, I didn't not scam the individuals; purely research for others* benefits. It still happens...read up about people getting scammed, and you'll find it's still happening at LBC =\

a thousand bits is closer to 20-25 pennies. Today, $1 is somewhere around 4,000 bits.

It's not just Bread wallet's passion ... it's the passion of many other Bitcoin leaders.
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:48:30
it's out?!?!?! YES!!!
@_date: 2016-07-12 21:29:36
sure you can! buy an old one...they're still much better than many new mobile devices :)

Converting bitcoin to bits: remove the period (.) and replace it with a comma (,) ... put a comma after the 3rd digit ... and then put a period on the 3rd digit after that newly placed comma. Examples:
* 9.18772348 --&gt; 9,18772348 --&gt; 9,187,72348 --&gt; 9,187,723.48
* 0.00015541 --&gt; 0,000,155.41 --&gt; 155.41
Once worked out mentally, most people can do conversions quickly, and even without any effort after a short period. Onto the next one...
Converting bits to bitcoin: if you don't have a million bits, then you don't have 1 bitcoin. Done.
You got this :)

I found out friday that Chase closed my bank account because their analytics shows that I am "risky". Which is completely BS. So basically I'm having a difficult time accessing my money. Considering I've never had a criminal record, have established a long relationship with Chase, and have a legitimate business (which resides in a different bank account)...I'll consider their actions as a limitation on my withdrawals. A sneaky one.
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:11:27
...in fact, the only reason why I even found this reddit on google is because I'm trying to figure out if something's going on with Chase! Looks like something is!
