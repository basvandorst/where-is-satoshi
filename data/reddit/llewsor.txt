overall this is great news. the difficulty will drop temporarily since there will be less miners competing/mining. then other miners in other countries will pick up the slack and the difficulty will go back up. 
the bitcoin price may also take a hit temporarily due to fud - but this is healthy to smash the mining monopoly. 
china cracking down on their miners will decentralize the unhealthy concentration of miners under one government/jurisdiction. this could help reduce the effect of chinese miners manipulating the mempool when they flip between mining bitcoin and bcash during emergency difficulty adjustments.

This, looking for cheaper (renewable) sources of electricity is a major incentive for miners since it is capital intensive and profit margins are so thin.
Also some miners are already utilizing the "wasted heat" and recycling it to heat homes, green houses and fish farms. So bitcoin mining could actually be a net positive economic and environmental activity:
The media just screams about the cost and "waste" of mining. But creative miners are already seeing the problem as an opportunity to utilize the byproduct of heat for other commercial purposes.

"They were successfully forced to participate by contributing directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem instead of relentlessly and freely profiting from it."
This sentence articulated what I've been thinking about for a while. Because Bitcoin is fundamentally transparent, decentralized and censorship resistant it exposes/disintermediates any party in the ecosystem that tries to manipulate or strong arm their will onto others. But it also elevates and rewards any party that plays fair and honestly.
Coinbase got exposed for playing dishonestly. They must choose to capitulate and come clean and play by the consensus rules or be  disintermediated by another party like Bisq who will step in and play fair.
The Core devs once again have demonstrated that they are honest and play fair by the consensus rules otherwise they would have been disintermediated after the dozens of crisises (Bitcoin Unlimited, Segwit, Bitcoin Cash etc). Time and time again the ecosystem (wallets, miners, exchanges, merchants and users) have shown their support for the devs and their fair play.

Although he means well and is being objective with the facts - Erik has no concept of time in regards to how young bitcoin is. 
In terms of the fees, that's like complaining why you can't watch Netflix on your 28.8k modem (which probs half of Reddit are too young to even know about). It took the internet which is a fundamental institution in our lives today, over 20 years to scale to be able to stream hd video content when it used to take hours to download a single image. 
Bitcoin is scaling - just follow the developments with lightning network, rootstock etc. We need to remember the time scale we're at with this revolutionary yet nascent technology. 
In terms of the mining energy consumption, that needs a more nuanced analysis. It is true that mining is incredibly energy intensive but forward looking thinkers are recycling the "wasted" energy to heat homes or to heat green houses or to heat water for fish farms. Bitcoin mining can be sustainable if you think creatively of how to harness the heat to be used for other commercial purposes.

this. people don't understand that the key to bitcoin's security is incentivizing people's self-interest to mine bitcoin by forcing them to commit skin in  the game in the form of using electricity -  a real world cost. the more miners there are burning capital and electricity the more it takes for a bad actor(s) to commit even more capital and electricity to attack the network. it has become so obscenely costly to attack bitcoin's network that it's cheaper just to mine bitcoin rather than attack it.   
the majority of electricity that miners use comes from remote rural regions where surplus energy was being wasted. excess energy is being sold to mining pools. it's like people look at the amount of electricity it costs to mine bitcoin and become hysterical and think each miner is building a coal plant or something.

As Andreas Antonopoulos phrased it: banks, visa, master card and paypal suspended service to wiki leaks - but you can still donate to the kkk. This definitely more than about "hate speech".
People don't understand that ex communicating people and censoring their free speech sets a precedent to go after broader social groups. 
Only totalitarian governments censor free speech. Here's a quote from Martin Niemoller a pastor who was ultimately executed in Hitler's regime:
"First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—Because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out a - Because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—Because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."

congrats, the first thing i'd look into is storing on a hardware wallet like trezor, ledger or keepkey. this is because they are not connected to the internet and so are virtually impossible to hack (unless you are not careful with your word seed - do not type it into your computer or any reason). rule of thumb is not to keep any amount of bitcoin in an online wallet/on your phone wallet unless you are ok with losing it.  
lastly, there's an etiquette about not sharing your bitcoin holdings - not only is it just private info but also protects you from malicious actors in this space from knowing how much you have and becoming a target.

this article needs to be stickied, very balanced explanation of how bitcoin works, how ICE will trade and how custody and transfer of bitcoin will work. this quote is huge:  
“Our system would operate on a layer above the blockchain, and we’d keep our own omnibus ledger apart from the blockchain,” explains Loeffler. The Bakkt design isn’t revolutionary. It closely resembles a technology called “the lightning network” that’s already in use. In the lightning network, the same two participants, say an appliance-maker and a parts supplier, engage in multiple Bitcoin transactions. As long as the parties are using a fixed number of Bitcoins to buy, sell from one another, and store for that purpose, the transactions aren’t reported to the blockchain, and zap back and forth within the same ecosystem."  
maybe they'll consult blockstream about liquid?

btc holders and bitcoin core devs are not necessarily opposed to a block size increase. it is just the priority of increasing the block size vs other methods to improve the efficiency of the current block size to maintain security and decentralization. 
it is the equivalent of planning to build high rises to make more efficient use of the current land size and building vertically vs just creating an urban sprawl and building horizontally and making a bunch of one level buildings to accomodate the increase in volume. 
once every solution to optimize the current block size has been exhausted (lightning network, schnoor signatures, mast, bullet proofs) then there will most likely be a block size increase. 
there is no need to merge the chains back together. we both have the road map we want and believe in.

this is what frustrates me about the fud surrounding mining and destroying the environment. bitcoin is energy intensive for a reason: to ensure security through game theory. 
people just need to be creative about how to utilize the byproduct of heat generated from mining. 
1. you need real world costs/investment from the natural world to keep miners competitive and honest by having skin in the game and losing real money if they cheat. that's how bitcoin achieves it's security: through game theory.
2. the majority of energy consumed in bitcoin mining comes from surplus power - power stations that now have a revenue stream to commit excess electricity that otherwise would have gone to waste which was the situation before bitcoin mining. 
3. people are already experimenting  with heating their homes with mining. they have even devised a system of heating the water for a fish farm and greenhouse ecosystem:
bitcoin mining could be a net positive for the environment: imagine home appliances that mine while not being used or re-distributing usage/power to other devices. 
people need to understand that bitcoin is energy intensive to secure the bitcoin network - the only one that has proven itself with no downtime or hacks for 9 years.

if custodians like bakkt end up becoming bad actors and print more paper bitcoins than they have on reserve, they could influence the price of bitcoin by inflating the supply.  
but this is only bad for people that don't hold their own keys and don't run their own full node. hodlers and full node owners can just fork the chain and custodians like bakkt will be left holding coins for a worthless chain with no users. miners would follow suit since no one would want to buy their worthless mined bitcoins so they would switch to the chain that would have the consensus coin.

good points, as andreas antonopoulos remarked: technology is never perfected when it is first invented - it is only "good enough". then it continues to "fail gracefully" as iteration after iteration fixes and irons out weaknesses and faults or something better is invented.
so far bitcoin has existed for 10 years - it's good enough in what it purports to be: trustless, censorship-resistant, borderless, open technology. so far it has demonstrated that it is been "good enough" in these properties. obviously there are many ways to improve it, but this unrealistic expectation concerning trustlessness is a pretty fruitless exercise - especially if nothing better is proposed to compare it with.
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:52:59
this is andreas antonopoulos' argument as well. if a group successfully develops a quantum computer capable of compromising bitcoin, why the hell would they target bitcoin (volatile price, barely anyone uses it etc) when they can target nukes or the legacy system worth way more money. the quantum computer argument against bitcoin is over-hyped.

and bitcoin will arguably have the most profound impact on humanity out of all of them. hard, sound money isn't sexy - but perhaps that is our saving grace: a revolution wrapped up in a ponzi scheme that gave this technological gift a fighting chance to sneak under the radar of governments and give regular people a chance to take back freedom and sovereignty.

the all time high bubble was funded completely by retail investors - which is generally the opposite of what happens with new investment/asset classes.
usually it is the institutional investors/wall street that get first opportunity and drive up the price and then let retail investors in at the peak. so there is tremendous potential for the price to go up since weak hands have been shaken out and bitcoin has more or less bottomed for institutional investors to start to take positions.
also the fact that the u.s is 22 trillion in debt and must print more fiat to stay solvent will inflate the price of everything including bitcoin. central banks around the world are all in the same situation and must print more fiat to service their debts. so it's not necessarily that the price of bitcoin will go up so much as it's the price of fiat that will collapse.

here's my two sats about being a christian bitcoiner:
in a sense, satoshi nakamoto decentralized our access to sound money just like jesus decentralized our access/relationship with god. the religious elite during the time of christ claimed exclusive authority and righteousness about god just like bankers today claim exclusive authority and righteousness over monetary policy or as ex-goldman sachs ceo lloyd blankfein stated banks are "doing god's work". indeed, the only time christ expressed anger was to throw out the money changers from the temple.
just like christ, satoshi disappeared into the internet or ascended into heaven like christ did. not that i'm deifying satoshi, but he understood something as important as bitcoin couldn't be trusted in the hands of one person similarly to how christ left the gospel up to believers to fulfill the great commission and to negotiate consensus about the truth of the gospel just like node operators come to consensus about the true bitcoin protocol blockchain to follow. christ initiated the og: "don't trust - verify" so to speak haha.
also jesus came not as some big shot messiah with a military to overthrow rome, but as a humble baby that grew up in poverty and matured into a man to fulfill his destiny - similar to how the bitcoin protocol began as a very humble/fringe experiment that grew up in the slums of the internet and has been maturing for the past 10 years and didn't start out as some facebook/libra big brand initiative.
we definitely live in interesting times. all i'll say is that god told noah to build an ark - and in my years of casually reading up on the monetary system, the history of banks, the gold standard - i believe that god brought me to bitcoin to build an ark to protect the ones i love. just like noah endured ridicule from the world i don't mind enduring ridicule from our society today. the financial flood is coming.

pretty much every waves coffee have a btm. i prefer btms since they are anonymous (over $1000 purchases you need to provide your phone number and possibly other id ).
when buying, you get the btc into your wallet as soon as it gets confirmed (5 mins to several hours depending on the mempool) compared to exchanges which can take days. 
when selling, some btms require a confirmation before giving you the money which can take 5mins to several hours depending on the mempool size.
however there are some waves btms that don't need a confirmation when selling and give cash right away. i'm not sure why some need confirmation and some don't.
their rates vary between 7-10% so you sacrifice cost and anonymity for convenience I guess.

had a friend mention bitcoin in 2013-2014 but it went over my head. it just didn't impress me and to be fair no one could really explain it that well back then. so I ignored it. 
between then and 2016 I got into precious metals since I was always fascinated with history, the banking system and money.
during the same time I was listening to max keiser who preached about bitcoin ever since it was a dollar. I think while watching YouTube videos about max I stumbled upon andreas antonopoulos and fell down the rabbit hole.
I knew bitcoin was true sound money because andreas confirmed and reinforced many of my beliefs that I had developed over the years studying the history of money and the banking system.
I eventually sold all of my precious metals for bitcoin around mid 2016. and now here I am with the rest of you hodlers.

sprecher gets it in his gut, but he can't quite articulate what he means: "often times in finance, it's not about being the best — it turns out to be about being the broadest and the most commonly accepted and for whatever reason bitcoin has become that."  
that reason is because bitcoin is: anti-fragile, immutable, censorship-resistant and decentralized. no other blockchain has proven otherwise.   
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:56:41
as benjamin franklin said: "those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety".
after generations of people have grown up under the state with insurance/trusted third parties, personal responsibility/freedom over your finances and property (indeed your own life) is a foreign/incomprehensible concept. 
freedom/personal responsibility can be dangerous, but at least you're free. otherwise the state treats you like an infant.
when i explain securing your bitcoin to people they often scoff at the idea of how you can permanently lose your coins - and regard that as "scammy". they value security over liberty and so they overlook the deflationary, immutable and decentralized properties of bitcoin.
fair enough, the western world has had a fairly stable monetary system compared to the rest of the world and so it is difficult to see why bitcoin's properties are features and not bugs/weaknesses. but people that have experienced painful economic shocks like venezuelans, greeks, cypriots, zimbabweans, indians etc understand the value of bitcoin and so will the rest of the world.

gotta admit i was a bit repulsed and it wasn't one of his best interviews, but 99% of the time in interviews trace is humble and eloquent. trace is og, and for being around for as long as he has and hearing stories about people's lack of "personal responsibility" even when he personally told them what to do - i think it's ok for trace to be brutally honest and let the filter loose every now and then about the sheer foolishness and risk people take on in bitcoin.

i'll keep buying as along as the devs keep updating the code. price is not an accurate reflection of the value of the bitcoin network.
bitcoin "coins" were just an instrument devised as an incentive to pay miners for their service for creating blocks of transactions and securing the network since mining is capital intensive. the coins were not about investing or speculation even though that's what happened.
people need to realize that we've never had a technology that people could buy a "share" in the form of bitcoins. bitcoin is not a company like facebook or amazon - it is a protocol like tcp ip which makes it unique in terms of buying a "share" in it in the form of bitcoins as opposed to a share in facebook.
think of how ridiculous it would have been if people could buy a share of the "internet" such as a tokenized tcp ip or some other instrument. the same obscene price pumps and crashes would have been observable as well.
the fundamentals have not changed. coders continue to code, infrastructure continues to be built (lightning network, dandelion, schnoor etc) and institutions are preparing to move in (bakkt, etfs).
disregard the price, at best it's just a crude thermometer about public sentiment and manipulation/mania.

-miners in china are decentralized. they have no loyalty to either chain, don't care about the ideology, they mine the chain with the most profit. 
-the only part that is centralized in mining is the manufacture of asic chips which 70% is controlled by bitmain
-chinese miners don't communicate with the bitcoin community because of the government firewall of the internet, they are located in very isolated rural regions, there is the english language barrier and they are hiding their operations from the government so they can't post on social media
-there is a lot of fraud and scams going on with icos in china, but some people are making money and some icos are legit. however, people will realize that bitcoin is the true and most proven store of value with the profits that they make from icos. so there will be huge movement of profits from icos into bitcoin.

unfortunately in my experience bitcoin very much is a personal journey kinda like the matrix: it's difficult to explain, it needs to be experienced or studied on your own.
it's like when neo is brought into the real world and doesn't understand why his eyes hurt and morpheus explains that it's because neo has never actually used his eyes before.
the same with money, people don't understand why bitcoin is money because they have never used real money before - generations have lived and died using the fiat fractional reserve system believing that it is real money - which is why bitcoin is incomprehensible to their eyes (minds).
i would explain bitcoin to them by first explaining how the current monetary system works (banks, money printing, inflation/loss of purchasing power) and then explain the difference with bitcoin (decentralized, deflationary, immutable, anti-fragile). 
also, any lectures by andreas antonopoulos are very well articulated:

this was my shower thought: satoshi believed in the value of the decentralization of trust so much that he didn't want people to trust in him either. satoshi was a cypherpunk: "don't trust. verify" as the saying goes. 
satoshi knew his presence and influence would lead to the deification of his personality like some are currently doing for their own agendas and turning his white paper into dogma. 
science and technology don't have dogma. everything is subject to scrutiny and innovation. there are no sacred cows.
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:48:32
looks like you're off to a solid start. i would also look into developing the psychological aspect of your experience with bitcoin because when the big dips come - you'll need more than technical analysis and "head knowledge" to keep yourself grounded and from panic selling.
"he who has a why can bear any how".
you'll be asking a lot of "how" questions when the big dips come and so it's critical to have a solid "why" or reason why your in bitcoin to weather the storms. 
andreas antonopoulos explains the big picture about why we are in bitcoin really well:
good luck and congrats - welcome to the fucking show :)

people dismiss bitcoin because it seems out of date and attribute it's dominance to first mover advantage. but they don't realize that the first guy through the door gets shot first. 
for 9 years bitcoin has been shot at and attacked from every conceivable attack vector (and some unseen thx to the brilliant and diligent dev community that constantly test for bugs and hacks) and it's still thriving. bitcoin legitimized cryptocurrencies and paved the way for alts to succeed.  
you are correct to conclude that for other alts to succeed - bitcoin needs to succeed. of course something else may come along to the fill the power vacuum - but it won't be censorship resistant, immutable and decentralized. if bitcoin fails - the world will embrace a centralized cryptocurrency because a censorship resistant, immutable and decentralized cryptocurrency isn't sexy.
all of these alts are like apps, while bitcoin devs are building a protocol. people understand facebook and amazon but they don't understand or care about tcp/ip.

i understand the concern regarding distracting devs and now this update that will require closing channels. but if you listen to magical crypto friends where elizabeth stark makes a cameo:
(skip to 28mins in) she addresses the question of when lightning network "will launch". she makes a good point in saying that lightning network will never "launch" in terms of a hard deadline because technologies like lightning network are constantly being improved and debugged. 
so she says that the proper way to look at lightning network going mainstream is more of a roll out - an organic rate of adoption by merchants and other stakeholders.
so sure, psa's about lighting network not being ready are fine but in reality lightning network will never be "ready" or "launch". it's not like we're launching a rocket ship on a specific date.
as andreas antonopoulos says with software "once you launch, your problems are just starting because now you have to maintain it". 
so i don't think we should reprimand the risk-takers that are exploring lightning network on mainet because in reality lightning network will never "launch", it's going to roll out forever just like we use bitcoin even though it's still technically in beta.

This line of argument is like declaring: "8 reasons why the World Wide Web fails as a communication platform" in 1990. Communication applications like email was just the first application of the Internet. Nobody conceived of Google, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, Facebook, Snapchat, streaming gaming and video. The Internet isn't just a platform for communication \- the Internet is anything related to data.
In the same way, currency is just the first application of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a platform for anything related to Trust \(value\) and there are applications related to the transfer of trust and distribution of value that we can't even conceive of. But Andreas Antonopoulos gives us a glimpse like the concept of streaming money:

the point of bitcoin security is that it is decentralized - not impossible to hack.
so of course if someone was really dedicated and resourceful they could hack your cold storage device. but the point of bitcoin security is that the network itself as a whole can never be hacked because everyone controls their own money on their own cold storage wallets. 
so a hacker would have to have hack every single wallet - not like a bank or a server where a whole bunch of people will lose their money or data to a single hack.

I suspect that "bitcoin" will change its name soon to something more relevant just like the information super highway/ World Wide Web became the "Internet" and eventually just "the net" and lately "the cloud".
Andreas Antonopoulos remarked that bitcoin/blockchain should be more accurately be called "trustware" since at its fundamental level it is software that decentralizes and disintermediates trust in third parties. 
Who knows what bitcoin will be called 5 years from now, the name/brand of bitcoin isn't the end-all-be-all and the least important if it's properties. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:45:43
maybe my analogy is wrong on a technical level. but i think that andreas antonopoulos is correct that our design metaphors are going to change. wallets should be called keychains since they carry keys and not coins and you can't back up a wallet but you can make copies of a key chain. and there are no "coins" in bitcoin but entries on a ledger.
roger can keep the brand name he's so obsessed with. but as bitcoin evolves, it's going to become more of a backend process and fade into background as layer 2 and 3 applications are developed and adopted.
i'm not saying that there will be a hard fork type name change to bitcoin, i mean that as layer 2 and 3 technologies are built on top of bitcoin, culturally we won't be talking about or thinking about bitcoin at that point just like how people think they are on the internet when they are logged onto facebook.

an even more profound parallel is that both satoshi and christ believed in the decentralization of trust/power so much that they both made it a point for people to not trust in them either. so much so that they both disappeared from this world to avoid risking becoming deified by the masses and becoming the authority figure they stood against leaving it up to true believers to pick up the mantle and continue the revolution. 
i'm not saying that satoshi is a christ figure nor do i want to wedge religion into bitcoin - but what we can all agree with is that the decentralization of trust in every sphere of our lives (economy, spirituality, government etc) is a good thing to fight for.  
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:15:08
i find it interesting that christ came to break the centralized power of religious authorities and to decentralize our access to god (peer to peer relationship with god with no third party so to speak). also, christ had a particular contempt for money changers/bankers.
satoshi - whether he did so consciously or not, did the same thing with the banking system breaking their centralized power and authority and decentralizing trust so that we can engage in commerce peer to peer.

^ this is key, the bitcoin block reward is what incentivizes miners to burn money and electricity while creating blocks of transactions/ securing the network.

@_date: 2018-12-07 20:59:22
depends on which of the groups in the ecosystem get co-opted: developers, users/nodes, miners, exchanges and wallets.
if the miners, exchanges or wallets get coerced by the government to do something destructive to the bitcoin ecosystem, the developers can use the nuclear option to fork bitcoin and as long as the users/nodes follow the new fork then bitcoin will carry on. 
of course the price and hash rate will take a hit but bitcoin will still be censorship resistant and decentralized from being manipulated by bad actors. 
if the developers get co-opted then users/nodes can refuse to run the code and run the old code or different code from a different development team.
this is the beauty of the bitcoin ecosystem and game theory. not one group can claim to control bitcoin. it is more profitable to cooperate rather than try to cheat.

makes sense, miners take all the risk with asics, warehouse and electrical costs. when the prices are good then then the block reward can be sold or held. when prices/block rewards are too low, the warehouse and electricity costs still need to be paid. So shorting bitcoin as a hedge makes sense.
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:14:01
you have to come the right conclusion about eventually increasing the base layer block size, but this has been known for a while. the scaling debate was never either/or for block size. the devs and users for small blocks were arguing about priorities: first maximize the current block size (schnoor, mast, dandelion, bullet proofs etc) combine it with layer 2 (lightning network) **and then** increase the block size after. this is because you get exponential increase in efficiency when you increase the block size on the base layer, the effects/benefits cascade onto the other layers like lightning network.   
but if you increase the block size first before maximizing the current block size then you risk losing security, censorship resistance and decentralization.

it's true that politics has influenced adoption but bitcoin didn't set out to be political - bitcoin is what people make it out to be: if your currency is collapsing bitcoin is a store of value. if you're being deplatformed from payment providers bitcoin is uncensorable money. if you want the freedom to buy drugs or just buy privately/anonymously bitcoin is peer-to-peer cash. if you want to be a part of a cutting edge future technology bitcoin is a revolutionary protocol.

it should be obvious not use your phone as a cold wallet to store for long term.

we need to move on from satoshi nakamoto. does it matter who euclid is? does it matter if he was a good person or not? 
no, the only thing that matters is that geometry works.
same thing with bitcoin - it works and that's all that matters.

well said, i learned recently about how the world wars affected gold and the monetary system and how it influemced the shift towards a fiat based monetary system to pay for the war. 
it's fascinating that bitcoin seems to evolve during times of crisis such as first being released after the 2008 financial crisis and with another financial crisis (and possibly war) looming aheard bitcoin now has the ability to stay functional without the internet.
