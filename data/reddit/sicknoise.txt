im doing both! what a time to be alive :D

you can check this site for lightning stats :) 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:58:47
this is awesome :) i cant wait to use it :D
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:51:10
just wait for it to go back to 20k and the average joe will start buying in again lol. now is a good time to invest if you ask me
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:35:32
yea i should've worded it differently. the effects get more noticable once the majority uses segwit. it's still useful right now for anyone that want's to use it.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:36:31
watch everything from andreas antonopoulos on youtube and you will know it :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:12:15
yep that's very well said.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:16:32
fair enough. and ye my original comment was also a bit sarcastic :P just because i hate these articles.. this is way more complex then most people think. take a look at this vid for example 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:46:26
actually that's wrong. 
this is from 2 months ago : 
''Still, it’s important to put things in perspective. A recent report suggests that at current prices, Bitcoin miners will consume an estimated 8.27 terawatt-hours per year. That might sound like a lot, but it’s actually less than an eighth of what U.S. data centers use, 1  and only about 0.21 percent of total U.S. consumption. It also compares favorably to the currencies and commodities that bitcoin could help replace: Global production of cash and coins consumes an estimated 11 terawatt-hours per year, while gold mining burns the equivalent of 132 terawatt-hours. And that doesn’t include armored trucks, bank vaults, security systems and such. So in the right context, bitcoin is positively green.''
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:03:48
i'd rather turn off the banking system to save some energy 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:49:34
im gonna start buying now :) great shopping day!
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:45:09
of course! how can you not buy at these prices :)
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:45:16
it only helps if the majority uses segwit. 
@_date: 2019-07-28 07:09:53
this should help you 
@_date: 2019-07-21 17:15:11
there are so many that i dont know where to start. for example you can buy any item on amazon and pay with btc. or you can book flights and hotels. you can buy luxus houses and cars. you can pay bills and refill prepaid phone cards. you can play most casino games online with btc. and so much more.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:41:36
pretty much anything you can imagine
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:15:21
maybe because in the last year millions of people joined this ecosystem ? no one ever said that bitcoin will scale fast.. good solutions take their time and im glad it is that way because it insures the security of the protocol. why are you even transfering bitcoin right now if you know the fee's are high and the network is slow ? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:19:27
no it's a serious question. do you really need to transfer right now ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:24:52
this should be a sticky post imo.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:15:38
lol wtf you have to give them private details before you can donate with bitcoin ? fuck that.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:13:02
depends why you want to cash out. so many things can be bought for bitcoin. but there are many ways if you really want the fiat. coinbase is probably one of the worst with 10k daily limit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:58:06
you have to look at every one of them if you actually want to know that. not every fork is 1:1. and yes it's just other altcoins so they cac all have a different value.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:31:40
i was asking if he really needs to send RIGHT NOW.. weekends are always slower and fee's are usually higher too.. just wait a few days and you can already safe a good amount.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:30:20
fair enough. i agree that the current situation sucks but bitcoin just needs time to scale. it's a slow protocol and that has pros and cons. you will make enough profit anyways fuck the fee's :P complaining about them on here wont make the development faster.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:04:32
it's as easy to sell as it is to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:12:33
just saw a list earlier there are like 5 more coming in december alone lol but they wont be worth much.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:23:22
this is interesting af!
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:29:09
it was a rhetoric question lol
@_date: 2019-07-29 09:48:35
depends how you define "best" 
i personally use samourai wallet and sometimes the mutlicurrency wallet from eidoo.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:40:28
yep all for from bitcoin.

finally a new one and not the one from austria lol 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:44:32
aaaandd it happend .. :p
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:59:57
segwit will be included in the next update for the core client. it was supposed to be in this update but it got delayed due to the s2x fork and no replay protection. they had to prioritize that.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:39:10
i didn't mean they can implement what they want i was just saying that not all of them are getting paid and they could just stop and do something else. lots of the improvements actually came from the community and just got implemented by core with consensus of the miners/community. 
the whole thing is not easy to explain and im getting at my language barriers so sorry if i can't address your other points.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:06:36
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:42:11
i still love bitcoin! :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:09:33
korea is known to pay premiums on every coin out there lol.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:19:06
dont worry it will be back soon
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:58:26
im just gonna leave this here. 
take your time and read through it. lots of work is happening right now. and yes it takes a long time to upgrade bitcoin but this is also what makes it the most secure cryptocurrency out there.
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:08:19
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:56:18
nice i will have to do that too :P
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:04:58
you sound like you have no fucking clue how much work it actually takes to implement something like this.. not gonna argue with you.
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:06:18
you should check out purse.io
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:04:33
you might want to check out Digitalbitbox too, i prefer using it over my ledger. not sure about trezor i dont own one.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:56:56
read the title again..
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:56:11
just do it manually. the QR codes dont work sometimes i've had that problem before.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:00:13
net neutrality is only at risk in the US so not much is going to happen to bitcoin itselfe.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:15:45
yep. this sub has just been waiting for this moment lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:17:11
digitalbitbox, jaxx and exodus.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:07:29
im still waiting to retest 5k$ at some point but this might never happen :P
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:52:09
this whole debate happend in the last few months so why should i go back further ? im confused.. segwit has been in works for a long time yes but it also had to get tested frist and that took a few months. after that it could've been implemented but miners blocked that. really not sure what's so hard to understand about that. 
everything you asked me was discussed many times on this sub and other forums. 
also im sorry if it sounded rude that was not my intention.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:45:17
look at the whole post history to get a small overview on what is going on 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:13:01
it's over 9000
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:46:53
if you take a look at the website of digitalbitbox you can see what they have to offer. i really like the ability to make an offline backup. i also like that they kept the box as simple as possible with focus on high security and privacy. i might be a bit bias on this one because it's made in switzerland and im from there :P but i do believe that we have some of the highest privacy and security standarts in the world that's a big plus point for digitalbitbox imo.
Edit: this is one of my favourites too 
Plausible deniability:
Secondary password accesses a hidden wallet.
A wrong password for a backup creates a different wallet
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:26:42
yes pretty much.. Segwit got delayed by miners first and without UASF and S2X we would probably still be without segwit. 
The thing about core is they dont have to do anything. they all work for free on bitcoin and there is no one that tells them what they have to do, this is just how the developement of bitcoin works. 3 months might sound long in this space but it really isn't. other companies have big teams that worked on segwit right away because of the NYA.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:43:18
like i said english is not my first language and im having troubles explaining everything i read about this in the last few months..
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:02:39
yeah im sure there are a few.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:06:40
i would not be excited just yet lol :P lets see where the price is in 24 hours.
@_date: 2019-12-21 14:55:30
7% does feel a bit high but still nice that it's without kyc. We have the same here in switzerland but the fee's are lower. Around 4-5%.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:20:17
are you new ? this has happend a few times already.. hash power will be back soon
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:14:47
it's coming in the next update im not sure what your problem is... as far as im aware many of the core devs didn't even support segwit for a long time that's maybe why it took them a bit longer.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:18:35
i will wait to see if we break 6k everything under that is a buy for me.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:01:44
i get most of the news from twitter and reddit. most of the crypto media sites just post clickbait titles all day long with boring stories and no sources to back them up.
@_date: 2019-01-27 03:17:38
i use my bank account too. it takes 2-3 days for a wire transfer and as soon as the money is in my account i can buy btc and instantly transfer it away. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 01:59:39
Got into safex a few months ago, it looks very interesting. Cant wait to use the marketplace :)
@_date: 2019-01-13 14:53:11
what are talking about ? this is one of the few good games left. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:58:58
he had 1.8k before the meeting started today :P lots of new crypto followers.
@_date: 2019-01-27 01:15:41
this has to be US only. when i buy on coinbase i can send my btc instantly. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:19:00
Its very convenient and you can pay with cash which some people like.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:07:24
I think they just let sweepay use the atm infrastructure and than they can put 5% fees on top to make some money from it without any risk at all. Its a really smart move from sbb.
@_date: 2017-09-04 07:52:12
Here are the buy/sell fees 
@_date: 2019-01-27 01:17:55
that's so weird. i can also instantly withdraw when i buy btc on coinbase. im not even using pro.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:23:56
Not scared at all. China is just 1 country
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:21:03
Sounds like you have no idea how much potential bitcoin has, and how big the current fiat/forex markets really are.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:05:40
The sbb fees are 6%. Bitcoin suisse charges 5% so i think its not that bad.. Its not meant to be used for big amounts.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:03:18
Im actually panic buying right now lol 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:04:10
Why would you sell now ? Should've sold at 4900.. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:46:44
Same as yesterday or the day before. It wont be "stable" for many years imo.
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:25:27
Nvm i get it now :p
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:04:10
Why would you sell now ? Should've sold at 4900.. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:55:35
FYI you can just import the wallet if you have the private key. This saves you the tx fee and time.
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:07:52
Not a good idea to post something like this on reddit..
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:17:20
The market overreacted and people started buying the dip around 3k. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:44:33
Good luck buying at 2500 :p
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:49:47
No but there could be one, we never know that for sure. Bitcoin is never really stable because the market can react so fast and its still a small market compared to stocks for example. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:28:53
No need to get rude.. English is not my first language.
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:43:21
what exactly are you trying to say with your post ? 
yes bitcoin is a big experiment and no one can say what it will look like in 20 years
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:55:56
it's actually a pretty decent panel imo. not much FUD at all.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:28:53
No need to get rude.. English is not my first language.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:19:48
looking at the transactions alone is useless. you have to consider outputs per transaction aswell. and that stat is going up.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:23:56
Not scared at all. China is just 1 country
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:59:56
How come you didn't backup the seed phrase ? It even tells you that its the only way to get the wallet back.. Sorry to say but it sounds like you lost access to your funds. Not sure why it kicked you out of the wallet tho. I would recommend you to get another wallet if you plan on getting more crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:21:45
find someone that wants to buy it from you. shouldn't be to hard.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:03:18
Im actually panic buying right now lol 
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:32:54
True i did not think about that. But as long as you have the private key you cab just import it again.
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:50:04
To a wallet where you controll the private key.
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:14:39
A few things like stuff from amazon, vpn, using a btc debit card from time to time, paying my friends in btc/crypto, and some more stuff. And no i dont regret it one bit. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:50:11
Try localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:47:58
Are you really asking that ? Lots of people are buying the dip
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:34:59
Maybe i should stop buying there, but its just so convenient :p
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:53:02
Glad i got myselfe a digitalbitbox :)
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:02:33
Yea the fees are pretty high :p but i still use it from time to time because it's so convenient.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:17:20
The market overreacted and people started buying the dip around 3k. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:39:20
I would not cash out tbh. Maybe just get a btc debitcard and spend the btc that way if you need it to buy food and stuff. If not just hold longer ;p
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:01:26
The fees are 6%. Bitcoin suisse charges 5% at their ATMs. I uss the sbb atms to buy btc more than i would like tbh but its just so easy and you find them everywhere.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:05:44

That's not how it works.. Or else you could just buy bch and get free btc :p
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:36:38
It's impossible to answer your question. Everything could happen to the price.
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:56:10
Just do it now

Good luck buying at 2500 :p
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:14:19
If you look at the growth in last 24 hours you can see loads of different crypto reddits :) the whole space is growing so fast it's awesome.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:29:14
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:07:15
Currently you can buy bitcoin at the ATM but you can not use it to purchase tickets. This is planned for a later date afaik.
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:10:47
Only if you swap back to fiat ;) 
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:52:42
If you look at history evolution is getting faster and faster.. 10 years ago smartphones were considered to be useless. Its not that crazy. Also if you look at all the money that's being made ( physical and digital ) and than think of bitcoin as a black hole that can suck in all the new money, its not that crazy anymore :p
@_date: 2018-04-11 09:54:56
anything is possible. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:38:07
The price of btc or alts.
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:11:40
Any update one this ? Did you try to contact jaxx support? Would really like to know what's going on..
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:11:14
its saturday.. just saying :P
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:58:26
Why would it be illegal? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:37:55
you cant buy btc for USD on polo
@_date: 2017-05-16 10:47:52
not sure what you mean tbh.. bitcoin is pretty easy to use imo.
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:02:59
I prefer shapeshift. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:50:24
how the fuck are you able to tell what i will be in 20 years? its all speculation.. it could be worth 100 trillion for all we know.. and i dont know about you but x10 is still a lot of money to be made imo. and if you really want to make more look at some alt coins.
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:47:11
i think you will just have to pay the price if you cant find any cheaper ones in australia. did you check if there are any BTC ATM's near you ? 
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:43:12
thats not true im using a credit card from europe on coinbase and it works fine.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:07:46
you dont.. you can not buy btc on polo with fiat ( USD, EURO, Yen and all the others ). you can only exchange btc on poloniex. if you wanna know where to buy btc i would suggest you look for an ATM near you and if that doesnt work you can always use coinbase.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:30:18
Thats exactly what im doin right now! :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:45:30
because more and more new people find out about bitcoin and want to be a part of the hype. also many people that cash out or try to margin trade. there is only 16m bitcoins atm with a MC of around 40b. this is still nothing compared to other markets so the price can still rise way more than it already has.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:48:34
the one i use has 6% fee and you have to give a phone number. i dont mind it to much. 
i wouldnt buy a large amount there but if you just want to buy for a few 100$ its fine imo
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:30:38
The risky thing with paypal is that you can chargeback pretty easy.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:11:50
chill it cant up all the time.. it will go back dont worry.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:03:58
i hope so

Where are you from?
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:43:56
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:16:33
More people buy/use bitcoin = price goes up.
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:42:18
IoT has probably the most use cases.
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:46:21
i dont think they accept bitcoin but you can buy bitcoin at every ticket ATM in switzerland which is pretty huge imo. the fee is 6% so its somewhere in the middle with other ATM's.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:14:37
im pretty sure the opposite will happen so please dont spread rumor here without backing it up..
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:43:42
im still pretty new so im not sure about the cost for exchanging tbh but i just like shapeshift because you dont have to register. i use bittrex as my main trading site though.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:22:27
I would recommend you to read more about bitcoin before you buy some. Youtube is also a great place to learn more about bitcoin and crypto in general.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:33:44
maybe for some time but it all depends what people do with their money. i dont think all the people would go back to fiat. which means some of the alts will get more volume and higher prices.
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:18:29
I would just keep them on the ledger and not worry to much.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:02:27
i agree with everything but point 5. :P
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:19:22
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:15:58
Sure i think it will be even more
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:01:25
they are probably getting a ton of new orders :P
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:06:32
well maybe you shouldn't listen what other people tell you and maybe you should research it yourself .. its obvious that crypto is still very volatile.
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:25:53
I would guess that people use it because there are no limits if you dont use an exchange site. 
To your other question, yes you can buy with cc on coinbase for example. They also give you the option to store it but it's not recommended to store anything on an exchange except if you want to trade.
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:15:00
Yes you can transfer from your bank account but it takes a few days 
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:57:22
Coinbase,kraken,gemini, local bitcoin, bitcoin ATM's
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:51:00
sounds like we need a decentralized card issuer :P anything in there about BTC apps on your phone ? looks like we'll just have to only use those.
@_date: 2017-06-26 10:02:38
Look for a btc ATM near you.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:44:08
true everything could happen.
@_date: 2017-06-25 07:39:52
you should research some more if you dont see why bitcoin will change the world. i will give you some hints :
1. its decentralized
2. EVERYONE with internet can open a bitcoin wallet and use it.
3. there is no inflation. the maximum amount of bitcoins is 21m.
4. its faster and cheaper.  its getting a bit slow and expensive right now but this can be fixed and it will be imo. 
5. no bank or gov can control bitcoin. ( this goes with point 3 )
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:42:53
no i mean the amount of bitcoins that will exist. there will never be more than 21m bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:56:02
oh ye i didn't think about shipping cost for people outside switzerland sorry. yes i know most hardware wallets are sold out right now. they will deliver july 10th.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:01:16
jaxx is probably the most popular one but its a hot wallet so i wouldn't store much in there. if you want to store a lot of BTC i would recommend you to use a hardware wallet or even a paper wallet if you plan on holding for a few months/years.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:10:58
Im in for the long run. No exit stratrgy. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:32:24
looks like someone wants cheap btc's lol.
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:36:12
Wtf that sucks. Not sure how i feel about this but it sounds like BTC cards are useless now :/
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:02:43
fucking gov always trying to ruin everything :P  we can only hope that more and more merchants start accepting it :) 
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:39:26
we will see.
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:20:18
hmm ye you're probably right. but how would that work with prepaid cards ? how can they track how much is on the card if you dont give them the pin.
@_date: 2017-06-25 07:46:02
it will have to change from PoW at some point. i hope we will have something better than PoS until then :P

Uasf = user activated softfork
Uahf = user activated hardfork
Google soft and hardfork if you want to know more about it.
For your other question. I would recommend you to read up on the basics of BTC and ETH and then see for yourselfe what you like more. Its always good to diversify a bit so you have a lower chance of loosing it all. Rule 1: NEVER invest more than you can afford to loose. And if you know you will need the money in a few weeks/months to pay something just dont invest it. Cryptos are high reward but also high risk.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:39:50
because bitcoin is getting slow and expensive to use compared to other cryptos out there. its simple. segwit could've been activated last year but it didn't and now we just have to do it.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:28:31
ye that's how i understand it aswell. asians seem to love ETC.
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:04:53
and ? it probably changed because they get so many orders.
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:14:21
you can get it back if you did a back up of your trezor.
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:06:23
Can confirm i sold all my btc and am now holding a few different alts. As soon as the debate is over tho i will come back to btc for sure.
@_date: 2017-06-30 06:26:36


that's your problem lol. also you can just turn off gps. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:40:46
also i can just exchange my alts for btc whenever i want to. its not like i went back to fiat. im still kinda holding btc.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:01:49
Yes lots if news look at the front page :p
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:55:46
Thats what happens. It can't go up all the time that's impossible.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:46:26
Challenge accepted! :)
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:11:28
lol the first pair is ETC/BTC :P 
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:03:43
oh well good time to buy :P
@_date: 2017-06-27 07:33:42
Mining btc is hard enough with good cards ^^ you can't mine on a phone.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:33:59


good point. thats also how i feel about it. its sounds pretty sketchy.
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:33:46
I use coinbase
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:32:52
Not sure if its actually possible at once. I would email some exchanges and ask. And also your bank.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:52:06
can't buy it with btc :/ what a shame.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:32:21
No but RSK will.
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:49:08
if you need a cheap hardware wallet take a look at this  its only 50$. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:10:14
thanks i was on my phone and didn't want to type so much lol.
i actually wonder how long a phone would last battery wise if you were to start mining on it :P probably 1-2 hours and the battery would be down.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:24:02
have you looked for a btc ATM near you ?
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:38:30
I wonder how they are going to regulate this. Are they working with visa ? Well another reason more for me to use annonymus coins. :p
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:00:02
i ordered 2 days ago and it was july 10th.
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:35:31
I have no idea what people charge on skype and i also dont know how safe it is.. I wouldn't use it personally. 
The limit on most exchanges depends on how much info you give them. Not sure about the exact limits but for me its 500€ per day if i buy with cc. With bank transfer its like 2000€ per day but it takes longer.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:54:09
there are always a few that are not affected as bad as the others.
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:50:22
Sry i cant help you but nice name :p Woox won!
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:26:38
No you can't. You can buy btc at every ATM but you can't use btc to buy tickets. Also the fee is 6% for anyone interested. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:23:27
yes 
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:59:24
Buy more :)
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:54:34
Seems like they want everyone to switch to crypto lol. Now i understand why asia is buying so much :p
