Why some serious manipulation? Why not just some serious selling?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:16:34
Yeah it’s a gamble. Either the price will go up or down. If it goes down then I’ll sell and my loss will be the % it has dropped by before I can hit the sell button + the fee. I can handle that. It also seems likely so I’ve got my sell order ready. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:29:36
Exactly. It climbed and then as soon as it started dropping, everything else went with it. The difference is everything else was already down before hand

All you're saying is many people saw bitcoin as an investment and are cashing out. We know that. As you said, the question is to what extent will it recover and how quickly. That's what we are all clueless about.

Why don't we just be honest with ourselves. No one has the slightest clue what the fuck is going on. No one. Amateurs and seasoned investors alike.

Tried working a bitcoin joke into my sex life. My wife was giving me a bj and I said “Baby, you must be bitcoin cause you’re going down.” She took my dick out her mouth, said “No you must be bitcoin cause you’re struggling to stay up.” She then slapped me and asked for a divorce.

The cult of hodling never fails to astonish me. I agree that it is a very safe strategy in the long run, but there are some clear moments where hodling is not the best strategy. For example, when you can see the price starts falling like a knife and shows no signs of stopping, selling and rebuying at a lower price just makes sense. 
Day trading is definitely a nerve racking way to live though. I personally like to hodl in general and trade when there is a clear opportunity.

You talk like this is all a conspiracy. This is how markets work. They go up and down. The idea that BTC is the victim of mass collusion which has full control over the market is so sinister that I’d have to question why you’d even choose to own any BTC if you really believed that.

This entire discussion is always neurotic as hell. I thought it was a given that the price goes up and the price goes down. Yet the mood in this forum swings dramatically with each price movement. The price goes up a bit “Woo!! Lol at all the people who sold! We’re going to hit 20k soon.” The price goes down a bit “Why is the price going down? Guys it’s over. It was good while it lasted. I’m getting out.”
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:31:41
I don’t think this can be reduced to any one change. I doubt bcash or coinbase is to blame. In my opinion it isn’t worth trying to pinpoint what the factor is that is driving the price down because it’s likely to simply be market forces at work. 
BTC saw staggering gains throughout 2017. It’s often the case that the price becomes more voilatile and starts to decline after such a price gain. If this never happened and it really did just inflate to a higher and higher price than it probably would burst like some people claim. These periods of decline are healthy for bitcoins future as a currency. They contribute to long term stability.
I just hope what we aren’t about to witness is a replay of 2013/2014: Exponential gains followed by a bear market that took a couple of years to recover from. Personally, I’m far too impatient for that sort of thing. I really hope things recover soon and we start bulling again.

If that happens I’ll immediately sell and cut my losses. Won’t be a massive loss if I sell fast. I’m going to take the risk though because it looks like it has found some support

You could argue that this was simply a case of being a greedy bastard. After turning a few coins into $5,000,000 he should have probably stopped and actualised a good amount of that profit. Why risk everything at that point? He probably had visions of becoming a billionaire and all sense and rationality went out the window along with those visions 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:49:14
I think we’re in the clear. It seems to have found a slightly higher support level now. Given that it broke 10k that’s a good sign. I think we’re going to slowly crawl back up to 17k over the next couple of days 
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:43:20
Yeah that’s my point. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:16:33
I mean yeah that could happen, but considering the amount the price has fallen people are still lacking confidence 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:35:23
Surely it could go either way though? People could wake up, see the shit show and sell. Or, people could wake up, see the low price and scramble to buy. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:30:50
Could be 100k. Bitcoin has done a 1000% increase annually in the past. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:06:10
You could be right. However, I think there will be a threshold where once crossed the speed will accelerate again due to investor excitement

@_date: 2018-01-26 09:31:34
They regret not having invested and are now trying to enjoy feeling like they made the right choice. That therefore implies that you made the wrong choice. Let them enjoy their little moment until the correction ends. Then they can go back to being resentful and full of regret as the price soars again
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:31:15
In my opinion this is just normal bear market movements. I still think this time next year we’ll be far beyond the current ATH. However, the bitcoin community really are the type of people to HODL to oblivion if it ever did collapse. I can just see it now “What’s everyone worried about? $1000 BTC is incredible? We’re still up 1000% since 2011? You wouldn’t get that with stocks.”
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:25:19
The price is far less correlated to news than it seems. Mainly it is market forces at work. Plain and simple. We are in a bear market. There’s an overall downward trend. It doesn’t take much to cause a continuation of that trend. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:15:49
Pretty good. I've gained more during this dip.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:12:49
The price isn’t always correlated to good/bad news. Sometimes it’s just market forces at work. We’re in a bear market right now. The trend could reverse itself any day now and we could start reaching new highs again but it could also continue the way it is all the way through to February for all we know. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:39:44
Thanks for the advice guys. I set some limit orders last night and went to bed. Looks like the dip down is happening slower than I thought. Better to be safe than sorry though!

To tell you the truth, this post appears more like spam than any with your all caps “ATTENTION” and your bold text. 
You’re saying that if anyone makes claims about which way BTC price will go then they should be reported, despite the fact that discussion of BTC price is allow on this forum. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:57:46
Mike is partially right here. The ideal scenario would have been for more and more people to decide they want to make transactions using bitcoin to buy everyday items. If using bitcoin as a means of payment were to have gained popularity the price would have steadily climbed. Instead what has happened is a small fraction of bitcoin holders see it as a currency and the majority see it as a valuable asset that they wouldn’t dream of spending because they see the potential for more long term price increase. 
The price is not what it is because there are many people using it. The price is what it is because there are many people buying it purely for the belief that the price will climb higher and they can cash out one day. 
This is not a failure of bitcoin as a currency. It is still being slowly adopted as a currency. It is however a sign the the true value it has as a currency at present is overshadowed by a much larger value produced by speculative trading. That creates the potential for a “crash” in price to occur one day. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:29:53
I would say in the next 6 hours if it’s going to happen. Seems to be the case that when it starts to dip really low the rate at which it dips accelerates. Last time it started dropping like a stone and then suddenly bounced back up

BTC and a bunch of alt coins are going through a correction right now after seeing massive price increases. XRP is currently undergoing its own price increase at the moment.

I think a lot of the big dogs in this game are using the same models to make their moves. When you have that much money at stake and an immense amount of profit to gain you are likely to seek the advice of professional analysts, etc. I reckon a lot of the big players are pulling out and buying in at similar price windows and it's all us little guys who are trying to keep up

I think this is just how dips go when there is a large market correction. I was expecting it to dip back down again tonight around this time, as were others. This analysis came out this morning and so far it’s been holding up to be a pretty accurate forecast. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:38:04
That's not true. Cryptos have entered the mainstream more than ever now. Everybody and their Granny is talking about bitcoin at this stage.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:28:34
I personally think it’s highly likely that BTC will continue to climb throughout 2018 and beyond. There’s still far too much excitement for people to drop out now. That being said, there are many people at this stage who are extremely rich through their BTC assets. These are people who have a strong incentive to actualise that profit by transferring it all into fiat. Therefore, as the price of BTC gets higher, the excitement grows, but the desire for large players to “cash out” in times of price decline also grows. 
Basically, it’s going to get even more volatile than it has already been. I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it actually did crash pretty low at one point, but I find it unlikely that it wouldn’t recover. This is simply because of the number of people who would see the low price as a massive opportunity to get in on the action in a way they never could have before. As for those who just HODL HODL HODL, I don’t see why they aren’t willing to sell and rebuy at a lower price.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:12:48
You will forever HODL alone.
When you HODL through a storm, hang your head in shame, at the end of the storm just more wind and rain.
Don’t treat your gains to a roll of the dice, instead sell and then buy again at a lower price.

@_date: 2017-12-31 00:22:28
That's the public perception right now because there is a drop in price which is being presented by the media as the cryptoapocalypse. Once the price starts going up again the media will start up their hype stories again and the public will regain their optimism.

Nah mate this is just people sharing their opinions
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:23:29
I think things will remain bearish. The price will continue on the trajectory it has been going down for one or two more days until it plummets quite low. I think it will then bounce back up and maintain its momentum, being clearly bullish again before the end of the first week of January 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:53:43
I reckon bitcoin will endure a couple of serious crashes in the future. Each time people will be more reluctant to see cryptos as a pump and dump money making scheme and will be more likely to only put money into it so they can actually use it for transactions. By this point the usuability of cryptos will also be very good with lots of different companies and services accepting it. The next couple of years will be the time to make money out of it. Beyond that it will become more like a true currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:20:51
Okay, so it's 2:17am here in the UK. I'm really tired and would like to go to sleep. However, I have some money aside that I'd like to invest. Only problem is I want to wait until a nice low point to get the best buy in opportunity. If I go to bed and get up 6 hours from now do you think I'll have missed it? Essentially: In your opinion, is the low going to come in the next hour or so or is it going to be in the next 6 or 7?

@_date: 2018-03-30 09:02:37
The crash will not be over until some clear signal indicates that it’s over. That signal would be strong buying power that sustains itself based on new money entering the market.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:24:00
I think more downside is likely because we are in a bear market. In a bear market downside is the trend. People have been saying it is quite likely we’ve seen the bottom for months now. 
There is no reason to think the bottom has occurred until there is some kind of real turn around. I agree with you that it’s always a risk. Yes, you could sell now and then the turn around occurs causing you to buy at a higher price. But that’s why I said to wait until something confirms the price is going lower first. 
If the price breaks down below 6k you can be assured that panic selling will occur and it will start dropping like a stone. We’ll just need to wait and see I guess.
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:50:34
Personally, I will never understand the HODL mentality. If it is clear that more downside is likely then when not simply convert to your local currency and buy back in at a lower price? Currently there has been a slight bounce. I am going to see how far this goes. However, if we see the price touch the point it bounced at again and then breakdown below it, I will sell. There is just no logic in holding in asset that you are well aware is devaluing. By buying back in at a lower price you make a profit.

Diversifying your portfolio is seen as a good strategy in stocks and the same is often applied to crypto investments. It means if one coin goes down the tube, you didn’t have all your eggs in one basket. It also means you can make some risky investments in coins which may or may not take off whilst still maintaining other safer coins as well

@_date: 2018-02-03 12:38:39
Try not to think about this as a narrative. It can be tempting to imagine that there are these cunning, manipulative, shady characters that are scheming away together behind a locked door. In reality, most of the price movements can be explained through simple market forces. 
The bounce that occurred yesterday happened because a crucial resistance level was met. The price fell back in level with the overall rising trend-line. The assumption from a lot of investors at that point is that it has reached the bottom. Therefore, a lot of buy pressure is suddenly triggered. We are currently stuck in limbo beneath another key resistance zone. If the price is able to break above then another sudden jump in price will occur. If it is not able to surpass that level, the price could just grind back down again.
Everyone is looking at this the same way: through guesswork, which is an educated guess at best. This includes whales. The graph itself can be looked at as the sum of all guesses. The true price then reflects the guessed price. It is sort of like a self fulfilling prophecy. If more people guess the price will move up than down, then the price actually does move up. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:23:46
I did the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:42:48
Essentially what you are saying is people tend to capitulate. That's true and one of the factors contributing to crypto volatility. However, that doesn't necessarily make the information useless. For example, throughout this correction we've been in there have been numerous support lines indicated by analysts. Each time one of these support lines were touched a sudden bounce occurred. The people who decided to hodl through the whole thing were not in as good a position as those who sold and bought back in at those support levels. There are people who used this strategy all the way down and actually profited enormously from the correction.

I see a lot of naive people here. I know it’s important to avoid FUD, but saying things like “We’re still up from last year” is just not wise. There has been a serious amount of damage done to the market. If you look at the all-time chart, the rise and crash we are experiencing looks a lot like what happened at the end of 2013. The only difference is that the peak was way higher this time.
I have no doubt that BTC will be worth a fortune in the long-run, but that does not mean we will not endure another major bear market before then. 
Hopefully there’s another bounce that fires us back up and maintains it’s momentum. I’d love to see that. However, BTC is not your friend. It does not owe you anything. There is absolutely no reason that the market could not callapse temporarily as it has before. 
I’m just waiting for the people who HODL all the way down and then claim “Guys it’s still up since 2011?”
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:54:29
I wouldn't say technical analysis is bullshit. It's guesswork like everything else in this market. But an educated guess is still a better guess than a complete stab in the dark. If you can improve your decision making overall by even 10% that can have a big impact on your long-term profit.

@_date: 2018-02-10 22:47:27
To me a lot of TA reads the same. "As you can see, we have found strong support at the fibonacci retracement level. Some bullish momentum is now apparent. However, strong resistance still remains over head. A successful break of that resistance level could see a move towards a breakout. However, failure to cross that resistance will likely result in a head and shoulders pattern and the continuation of the downtrend." In other words, the price could go up or the price could go down...?
Don't get me wrong TA is very useful and there are many successful traders out there who have made a fortune through it. But there is a lot of TA which is really just a very fancy way of saying nothing at all.

I will never understand why people cannot just accept the way that market forces work. Manipulation on any scale is not necessary to explain why people would sell at that point. The trend is downwards. The saying goes in trading "the trend is your friend". People sell in a bear market and then buy back in at resistance levels and short to make some profit. That's why you see these sudden spikes during the overall downward trend.

What do you mean true scientific evidence that it is useful? It is based on mathematical models used to predict economic trends. The fact the the models exist is based on the fact that what happens is in reality not completely random. However, no one can see the future. Therefore it is still only a prediction. But even if TA only improves your decision making by just 10%, that's still better than nothing at all. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:41:17
A lot of people are calling this a dead cat bounce. I don't think that's right this time. Yes, the price will obviously dip back down again after this little climb its been on today, but in my opinion it will not dip as low as it did before. If you look at the graph you can see that something as changed. The pattern has been broken. Instead of seeing these sharp bounces followed by slow dragging drops to a lower low, we are now seeing a slow steady climb with a quick dip to a slightly higher low. The bulls are returning.

Why would everyone capitalizing on that information make it useless? You don't have to be quicker than a computer or even quicker than other traders. If you have reasonable buy and sell decisions which are thought out carefully you will profit more than buying and selling erratically. Obviously hodling is the safest and easiest option, however, it is not random which traders are successful. Successful traders aren't just lucky. They are the ones who are best at analyzing market trends and making good decisions.

Day trading cryptos is a little like playing blackjack. It’s unpredictable and ultimately a gamble. Day trading cryptos using TA from well experienced traders is more like playing blackjack where you are counting cards every second hand. It’s certaibly better than not counting cards at all, but you’ll still get that random element thrown in every other hand that can knock you out of the game pretty quickly if you’re not careful.
