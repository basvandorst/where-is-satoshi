If you have another method of getting the attention of possible BTC investors then I'm all ears.  This project is still in stealth mode and has been in development for over 10 years.  Totally on the level.

I understand you skepticism.

Thanks for your reply.  Do you have a suggestion for another subreddit that would be more appropriate?

All of you posting your smarmy comments, I get it.  I understand your skepticism.  It's tough to find funding for anything.  I thought I would reach out and give this a try.  If you had the funds to engage you would find that I'm talking about a pretty cool project.

It's not tech or some hotel scam like that poor European guy got suckered into.  But if you have at least 600BTC then PM me.

Not sure my accountant would be up for something like this.  I need to locate someone who is up on the latest Crypto rules.

Thanks for that clarification.

Yeah, probably not the best place, but I thought I would give it a try and see what shook out.

Thanks, I've been reading your posts and a few of the articles.  Still trying to wrap my head around all this stuff.

Thanks, I was hoping it would be something like transferring an asset to a non profit so that they would adsorb the tax liability.  Yes, I definitely need a tax pro.

This would be equity in the company/production.  Returns on profit would be in fiat.
