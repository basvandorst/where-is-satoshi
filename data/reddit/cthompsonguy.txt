I don't place an order of less than $100 for that very reason.

Especially with their recent black eye. They should do something to generate good will in their customers.

I was mining when it was worth less than a dollar. I had about 5 BTC at one point. Rode the wave to $20, and when it crashed back down to $3, I sold out. $15 for 5 BTC. That's not even enough to cover the alcohol that I consumed because of that decision...

Especially knowing now that if I hadn't sold in 2010-ish and held to sell more recently around $19,000, I would have already paid off my mortgage and car loan.

The price has dropped a bit, yes, but that doesn't mean that the market is dying. That's standard fluctuations.
You seem confused about what the blockchain is... There's no such thing as a "Blockchain of Gold" because that would require a real-time public ledger of where every ounce of gold is in the world at any point. 
The Blockchain means that Bitcoin can't be "hacked". It means that counterfeiting is impossible. It means that you can see if someone is trying to manipulate the market.

No, he was trying to offer advice about a mistake made by someone 8 years ago. That's not how advice works.
I'm not an undergraduate college student anymore - I was 8 years ago. My point is that judging someone's financial decision making abilities based on what they did 8 years ago at the young age of 20 is foolish, and offering "advice" to that person - 8 years of time and maturity later -  is pointless and condescending.
The "removing yourself from the gene pool" comment is the hyperbole I was talking about.

Nobody is suggesting that BTC is ready to replace government-issued currency for government purposes.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:05:11
You continue to prove with every post in this sub that you have no idea how crypto works. BTC isn't backed by a government or company because it doesn't need to be. There's no "criminals and scammers" backing or controlling the network. You're clearly projecting here. **Who hurt you?**
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:17:57
That's quite a thing to say about an undergraduate college student...
That was a long time ago. I've learned a lot since then.
Your version of "friendly advice" is pretty damn close to "You'll never amount to anything."
You are a hateful person and should probably remove yourself from the gene pool.
"Sorry to sound like a dick just some friendly advice :)"
EDIT: Apparently people don't understand the use of hyperbole to make a point about the previous poster's comments. I meant no offence to anyone but that individual in hopes that he would learn what "friendly advice" about a person's *past* **doesn't** mean.
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:48:24
The market has already made that case for us.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:13:50
Except that it doesn't do that. It's an established currency and store of value because people accept it as such. The price fluctuates, but it's in no danger of becoming suddenly worthless like fiat is.
See [Zimbabwe]( and [the USSR](
Your comparison to MySpace is invalid because BTC is decentralized.
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:59:16
Because I used hyperbole to point out the problem with his "friendly advice"?
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:26:38
It takes some learning, but [knock yourself out](
the most useful part of it is automatic. Mining programs analyze it to verify transactions. Let's say John sends 0.05 BTC to Tommy. There's a delay while it's verified, but only 5-10 minutes, usually. If John somehow spoofed coins and submitted an invalid transaction to the chain, the mining program says "Hold up, John has never received more than 0.03 BTC, and he's already sent 0.02 BTC of it anyways. Invalid transaction." Automatic anti-counterfeiting.
Also, the wallet addresses and contents are public information, although there isn't anything to identify the actual owner. But if you see a bunch of massive transactions on something like [this visualizer]( you can keep an eye on that wallet to see if they're trying to throw the price with their large transactions.

You're missing the point. The open-source-ness of BTC and Blockchain is what makes it great - it's transparent. We can see what's going on behind the scenes. Can you say that about USD or your other fiat of choice?
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:02:59
You clearly don't understand how Bitcoin works. It's not a "set of 1s and 0s" that can be copied like data. It's intangible property made tangible and transferable through a public ledger.
@_date: 2015-03-26 15:45:05
That's exactly why I came to the comments.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:29:10
Because a larger block size leads to more of a monopoly on mining - limiting it to even larger and more well-connected pools. Or, in the case of the current debate about the proprietary mining system, monopolizing all mining into *one specific pool*. At that point, you throw out all notion of a decentralized system.

The only problem with this is that it requires companies/developers to pick up and start using these "hidden" functions. As I see it, Bitcoin is currently successful only because of how many people are getting "free" money by mining it and the people who are playing it like a commodity market - very few businesses are actually accepting it as a legit currency. If these features are actively developed and used, the Bitcoin will take off as a standard world currency. Only one question remains - will that happen before it dies from reduced mining profits? These developers need to get busy if they want to save the currency...

Is this site (or rather, both sites involved) legit? I've never dealt with either of them.
Even that price is rather expensive for a t-shirt (roughly $12.50, and another $5 shipping), but I think I'll go for it once I get out of class. My bitcoin wallet is on my phone, so I'll have to wait a bit before I can pay for it.

The problem is that BTC still falls into the "geek" category, and most service providers are not geeks. Now, if computer technicians were tipped normally, that would be a great tip.
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:40:17
Only because the Bitcoin price as at an all-time high. How long will it stay there? Are you expecting the price of the Bitcoin to triple every time the block reward is halved? And the block reward generated from just transaction fees (after our current reward period) will be so small that only the extremely-efficient miners (pretty much just ASIC machines) will be able to profit from it.
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:40:24
Thanks for the tip!
I just placed my order. As far as "making it look more legit", I honestly don't know what to add... At this point, it's mainly just name recognition. As a first sale, that's obviously impossible, but the best thing you can do is make a name for yourself through multiple successful sales and get listed on some of the forums and pages of links for online retailers that deal in BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-29 12:48:01
The problem is that a public key and private key system on the card is even more confusing than this. At least with this website's system for tips, redemption is easy to understand and complete. And the system that you described does not provide refunds for unused tips. If someone throws that card in the trash, some amount of BTC has disappeared from the economy completely.

It does on modern browsers ;)

I received a receipt from BitPay, and my wallet says that the transaction to BitPay was confirmed. The delay that you're seeing is probably the network delay as it tries to confirm the transaction, but even that should only be 5-10 minutes.
