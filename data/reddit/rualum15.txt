Thanks for all the help!

Got it. Does that make selling bitcoin through PayPal on localbitcoins somewhat safer? Or still no?
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:06:34
What? How can that happen?

The queue appears to be backed up. I sent bitcoin 2 hours ago and it hasn't reached its final destination. A few other users also mentioned a similar problem within the past 12 hours.
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:39:49
I've done a lot of refreshing in the past 2 hours, but it still won't go through. While we're in this boat together, it's still a shitty boat to be in.

Yep, sent some btc at 11 A.M. from Gemini. Nothing has arrived, but the transaction has been confirmed 35 times. It's bullshit.
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:06:36
I sent 300 worth of btc and it's been pending for 2 hours

Boners at full mast boys!

This guy gets economics!

I imagine a mythical war between dollars and bitcoins where the bitcoin is just overwhelming dollar bills, similar to the scene in 300 where the Spartans push the Persians to the cliff.

Supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:09:30
Can't wait for it. This train has no brakes! All aboard!

Depends on the state. Some states give tax breaks for purchasing electric vehicles, while others no longer provide the same incentives.
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:09:59
Pssh...20K hopefully
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:12:03
Hey man, thanks for the advice. I thought I tried it earlier, but I double-checked. Still doesn't work, but any tips help.
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:56:54
I have no idea, I live in the U.S. Just do a conversion from Euros to USD.
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:25:16
Yeah, I read a lot about these P2P decentralized exchanges and didn't believe the hype. Is Coinapult safe?
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:02:15
I always trust a man who lifts.

I have an account, but don't feel like verifying it because it doesn't seem worth the hassle to me verifying my proof of address, since the utility bills aren't in my name, but rather my roommate's. Would you recommend it?
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:25:51
What would you recommend? I want a website that I can link to my bank account to easily sell btc.
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:13:55
Just bank statements, a pay stub, and maybe a hospital bill.
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:18:36
Yeah that was what I wound up doing. Sucks that they suck. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:06:38
Thanks for the response my man! I figured that would be the case. What a terrible policy. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:01:39
Sent one transaction 26 hours ago. Still not confirmed. Agitated, but happy that the price keeps rising.
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:14:45
Gone? As in refunded to the original address? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:21:06
Thanks, maybe it's just because of previous great experiences, an average one seems bad by comparison.
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:25:07
I think after the Mt. Gox incident, it sort of triggers bad flashbacks for a lot of us.
