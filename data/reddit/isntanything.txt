Don't forget about visa etc blacklisting wikileaks.

Maybe pretend to 'spend' them?
Move them around a bit etc. 'Mix' them?
 Then For all they know you sold them for cash.
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:06:56
Surely you're not cashing out 100%?
May as well leave a bit as a speculation/gamble.

That wallet belongs to an exchange where the thief has sent it to sell.

Some sweet profits available as a local bitcoin seller!

Speedybitcoin.co.uk charge only 1.75% after you're verified. I've also set up a recurring weekly standing order. Best fee I've found.

I wish we could do this in uk but coinbase only offer out to us =(
@_date: 2014-07-31 21:14:31
We can't do auto buys in the UK. Your a lucky us customer.

Self inflicted 1984?
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:17:04
A shame huh.

Yeah I only started a few weeks ago and saw their previous warning so had similar concerns. Their support is good though, I think they would be upstanding. I also watch the wallet so see the weekly bitcoin get added to my wallet.
Once they paid me in bitcoin twice be mistake and let me keep the £10 extra bitcoin after I offered to send it back.

I disagree and think there is a psychological aspect at play here, especially when people know it used to cost $1, $7, $50 etc - they then feel that 500 is 'too expensive.' 
Even though this isn't very logical and simply means they could bet against it/short.

Actually an anonymous pool was doing the no claim thing on g hashes pool recently, to lower g hashes profitability so users would be more inclined to mine elsewhere.

My workmate follows tech news daily but hasn't heard of Changetip. 
...  Have any large tech s sites covered the news?

If tons more people buy tons more btc then the price of btc goes ... tons more.
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:36:35
Bitcoin devs need way more funding for this to happen easily, unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-11-23 08:56:47
I've tipped friends, family and celebs. No one every collects my tips. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 08:28:46
Dude was a great trader and shorter.

Someone said the 400k wallet belongs to an exchange.
@_date: 2014-08-13 22:54:46
The enterprising students sent out emails straight away, months ago, offering to buy bitcoins!
@_date: 2014-10-11 22:47:49
Surely this relies on your device remaining secure which a user can't guarantee. 
Personally I'd recommend mycelium for amounts you'd store in your fiat wallet. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 07:04:42
Exactly. So just hold and top up every now and again, especially on the dips down.

Hey, what search engine was it?
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:32:43
You need all of that for this weekend?
Just dollar cost average it if you want less risk of buying at the wrong time.
@_date: 2017-01-11 23:47:27
Love my new red shoes!
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:13:53
Makes no sense when a 3 is better then average!

The easy way to remember is; moral involves people you know.
@_date: 2015-07-23 05:05:05
But do they explain this on the rating system? That's the crux of it. Hopefully they do. Otherwise many meet think 4 is a good rating.
@_date: 2015-04-27 11:41:31
Real shame.
A great service with great communication.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:32:29
It shouldn't matter.
But I just love grabbing popcorn and hitting refresh.

As useful as w3c is, I think many devs claim it's shite.
@_date: 2015-11-18 08:21:42
I think the idea is that they pay the markup, as they have no other method to purchase btc.
@_date: 2015-10-28 07:00:54
Because it is completely game changing and revolutionary.  But you have to jump down the rabbit hole and learn about it to understand.
@_date: 2015-11-12 22:27:08
A man of many words, here.
@_date: 2015-10-20 19:22:59
I think UK banks are too anti Bitcoin. They tend to shut down all the bitcoin business's.
Speedybitcoin was good with scheduled set it and forget it recurring bitcoin buys, but the banks stopped working with them.
@_date: 2015-11-11 07:44:28
Looks great, but it's only probably fair if it is never fixed. 
It would be easy for the creator to game this and cheat, what's stopping them from hand picking the winner intentionally?
