I'm not a ChangeTip employee at all. I didn't even know that I was shadowbanned. This is just a random idea that popped in my head and someone told me : "Post it on Reddit just to see the reactions".

I've tried them all and I have to say : they don't improve at all the usability of bitcoin. They are shinier, they are easier to use *if you know bitcoin* but the absolutely don't bring bitcoin to the public. Usability is *not* about making a prettier software. Usability is a complete field of engineering.
I really think that, in that regard, my article is as valid as it was when written. Nothing has changed regarding bitcoin's usability.

If you need to find alternative and read a lot, then there's definitely an usability problem. Most innovations I've seen, including smartphone client, include opening an account and sending all your bitcoin to a webservice. And so far, there are none that I'm aware that can really be trusted. I really welcome your suggestions :-)
@_date: 2012-11-09 11:03:00
I don't agree. The usability hasn't evolved at all. The GUI is nicer but the usability is exactly the same (using bitcoin 0.7). Or did I miss some new tool?

I've tried multiple times to fill the form but the form seems to be sent into a blackhole. I have to admit that I learned this a bit after everyone because I was not following closely every subject on the bitcoin forum. I tried multiple times to enter into contact with former people from Tradehill without any answer at all.
They had my email so it was trivial to just send an email to customers.
The fact that they didn't allowed me to get my funds back a few weeks after the closure (instead of the day that followed) and the fact that they didn't send any emails to their users make me regret to have used their service and have the result that I would not be enclined to trust them anymore. Those are straight facts. (I challenge you to proove that any of those facts is wrong. If you can't, then your use of the word "FUD" is simply uncorrect)
Apparently, I was not alone in that situation. I've seen multiple people telling the same story on bitcointalk. But I'm speaking only in my name here.

According to the report, the man is a drug dealer and tried to have a murder committed. It sounds fairly reasonable for him to be convicted.
In that regards, I think it would be really interesting that you justify why you think that he should be helped and why you believe he should not be convicted because I cannot find one good reason to help him.

Take all the android devices, all the tv top boxes or devices which have Linux. Even some cars, some ATM. Now take the users of those devices : most of it don't know what Linux is.
Bitcoin will be the same: you will pay through digital money platform, you will transfer money, you will spend, earn, all of that without knowing that there's an underlying layer of bitcoin. That's of course my take ;-)

Well, it can be seen as "This is part of the plan, we will work on it when we have the funding". The approach is similar to an entrepreneur pitching a VP with only a sketch on a napkin: sometimes it works.
But I admit I wouldn't bet 1 satoshi on Mars One succeeding ;-)

I can show the emails I received from their automated system telling me that "My request is pending" (looked and, wow, it was already more than one year ago).
I can also show the private messages I tried to send through mail (and that bounced) and through bitcointalk (and that were never answered).
I also have a very old account on bitcointalk and my bitcoin talk history shows that I was an early supporter of TradeHill. I was also a redactor at The Bitcoin Sun (the only bitcoin related venture I was ever involved with) and did a very positive paper about TradeHill.
But do you believe seriously that someone would put so many efforts just to write on this obscure post on reddit? Come on, this doesn't make sense.
But it's even more simpler than that. In fact, you are calling me a liar but I'm sure Jarred himself will confirm that 1) they didn't send an email to their users and 2) they stopped answered their request form after a few weeks. So if he confirms that himself, there's not even a discussion.
So my questions to him:
1) Why were the users not warned by email? Why warning users on forums only when you have the email of all your users?
2) Why did Tradehill stop to answer to any request after a given time? (and what was that time exactly?)
3) What became the bitcoins of the people who didn't make a claim in time?
Don't you agree that those questions are essentials to answer if you want to ask people to trust you a second time after you broke that trust the first time?
You could argue that it wasn't their fault but it is. They trusted something (Dwolla) and make an error of judgement. It's a professional mistake. The fact that they were transparent about it on forums is good but they didn't send an email (second professional mistake). Two professional mistakes in a row = lost of trust. I don't see it as FUD.

I've explored some of the changes induced by bitcoin in

Building a trully usable bitcoin bank. Not a nerds software but something really easy. I already wrote the spec here :

Those are really good questions but what if ripple.com is opensourced? What if having XRPs is not that important (unlike bitcoin which holds the value)?

The problem with bank is not that they are bank: it's the fact that they are hugely centralized and thus having full power.
It's like Facebook or Google: you don't hate them (if it happens) because they allow you to communicate or to search the web. You hate them because they are centralized and it gives them a lot of power over you.
Ripple is completely decentralized. It is to bank what Bitorrent is to Megaupload

I'm in the same situation. Tradehill owes me 50-60 btc. If they don't reimburse, there's no way I would trust them with my money.

If the argument is "fuck the durg war" (which I understand), then you should help every single drug dealer. Why helping that one and no the small dealer next door?

No, I've many friends working in the space industry and they all know about it. They all say : "They can try but I'm not betting they will succeed". 
So maybe it is not a consensus but, at least, what several people in the space industry think.
Maybe the are also not willing to explicitely say that it might be a scam without any evidence.

Flattr is web service that allows to give micro donations to the content on the web ( you can read my description here:  ). Because of a popular request, they are actively looking into support bitcoin to:
1. Allow people to fund their account in bitcoins
2. Allow people to withdraw money earned as bitcoins
This tweet seems to says that there is still a need for bitcoin services. Point 2 seems to not be offered by any provider so far.
I will ask for more details about what is needed on the Flattr side but, in the meantime, what would be your advices?

In the space industry, there seems to be a consensus that Mars One is "legit" (they will really try to do what they say) but very few believe that they will succeed.
I'm really curious to read some more in-depth analysis about whether it is a scam or not.

From a legal point of view, he's innocent until proven guilty, indeed. But you will not help every single person facing trial because he may be innocent.
There are two cases where you would want to help someone in such situation:
1) If you believe that he has been wrongly accused and have evidences that the trial will not be fair. It is not the case here. I have no reason to believe that he's not a drug dealer linked to Silk Road and I have no reason to believe that, if he's innocent, the trial will not be fair.
2) If you believe that the person is guilty of breaking the law but that his actions were morally good for mankind and that the law is broken in that regard. Examples: Mannings, Swartz. It is not the case here, at least for me. Even if I'm in favour of legalization of drugs, I don't think that drug dealers are helping the society. And they exactly know the risk they are facing.
So, all in all, that makes absolutely no reason, at least for me, to help that guy. And I suspect that other think the same, given the reactions.

If Flattr doesn't want to host its own bitcoin server (and I guess they don't want), they need a provider that would automatically buy bitcoins.
If I retrieve 100€ from Flattr, the provider will automatically buy 100€ worth of bitcoins and send them to my bitcoin address.
But it seems no such providers provide this feature.

I hate all the replies saying "Just accept bitcoins and handle them yourself".
It is exactly the "But it’s easy, you just have to do that and that. It cannot be more easy than that." I've described in 
If you want to promote a technology, please learn to listen to inquiries first.

Well, then it should be really highlighted on the defense fund web page because it is, at least to me, not an intuitive argument.
