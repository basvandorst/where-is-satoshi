I came here to say this as well. I really do commend him/her for doing this and being so generous. I know this is world wide but please vet the organizations you send to. charitywatch.org is a good resource.
  
And as OP said, I wouldn't limit to just organizations. Sending just 1-2 BTC directly to a family in need, could make a huge different in their lives. With as big as the sub is I'm sure some one knows a struggling single mother or father. A solider with PTSD, etc.

Nothing. A sun storm wipes out the electric grid.

I'm at loss because I'm a very cautious person when it comes to downloads, but I must have slipped up.  
Downloads are gone. I also did a cipher /w:X on my drive yesterday too so its GONE, gone.    
Never installed teamviewer and remote access has been disabled on my PC since day 1.      
Only extension I have is adblock.   
AV up to date and it hasn't detected anything.      
I do use VPN's and TOR occasionally.   
I removed everything and just downloaded Electrum again. Looking for software differences and maybe I'll try and get some BTC from a free faucet or something this time and see what happens.   
Thx 4 feedback.

sucks. Prepare to have your buying ability disabled by coinbase though. I'm at my wits end trying to find an exchange that doesn't have a 2 week + waiting period..
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:56:14
thx :(
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:07:12
I get it, but maybe if places like coinbase provided proper customer service people wouldn't charge back. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:08:10
thx i figured ot out. going to post an update later. i got phished... at 9 am, sleep deprived
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:27:07
I thought about that, doubt this is the imposter...
