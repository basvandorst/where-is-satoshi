Ooh I hate hearing that in conversation. It really dumbs down the speaker in my opinion.

I have no idea, but this sounds awesome! Good luck.

Loss of bitcoins from the system don't really matter to an infinitely divisible currency.  we'd probably start referring to them as 2.5x10^-33 or some such jazz.
There could be one bitcoin in the whole world and we could divide it up to handle all of our transactions.

Also let him know its a protocol first, and a currency second.

Yea this is what im wondering.
I think its fine as long as you dont exceed 100 transactions. Not sure tho. Someone pipe up.
Edit- ah now i see what you mean. Im thinking that really its the same wallet just your hot one is (watch only). 
So im thinking it would write to one of the 100 addresses the two versions of your wallet share.
