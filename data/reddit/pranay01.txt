Oh.. Interesting. I was thinking Bitcoin Core doesn't have UTXO pools. If I understand correctly, having UTXO pool is not necessary for a bitcoin client right? These clients would then have to verify if a txo is spent or not by tracing the blockchain?

Yeah, miners can include what they want. I am just wondering is there a case of censorship or giving preference to particular transaction issuers even at the cost of losing on transaction fees? So may be they are getting some out of system payoff?

True that

There are issues with decentralised exchanges also:  
1. The UX is very poor. One needs to first transfer the money to a specified bank account via NEFT etc. and then wait for Bitcoin to show up on your wallet. Compared to this centralised exchanges are much faster.
2. Decentralised exchanges have poor liquidity - the prices differ a lot between an exchange like Zebpay vs a dex like Bisq.
Of course, centralised exchanges are security hole and also are subject to censorship as in the present case. I see exchanges like paxful and localbitcoin picking up after this step

Though I agree, I am not sure how much people really value it. For example, media is still primarily supported by ads (which in a way infringes privacy by sharing your data with advertisers) and efforts to support media on subscription (consumers paying money directly) have not been very successful

Can you give links to the more effective attacks you point in 1?

Folks, any thoughts on why BTC and ETH are inversely correlated? Does buying ETH makes sense (at this lower price) or only hodl BTC?
