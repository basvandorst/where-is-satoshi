Bitcoin lovers swarm to ponzi schemes like this.  It should be very lucrative.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:09:42
It's completely unregulated.  Somebody can state whatever price they want.  Fox news also proved it's legally okay for the media to lie to people so that basis is covered too.  Don't people realize that Mt. Gox is a single-point-of-failure and the recent hiccups proved this?  
@_date: 2013-03-01 07:32:42
It seems so... we will know for sure, shortly.
@_date: 2013-04-28 18:05:15
It's possible people will hedge their bitcoins with something like litecoin which would be much more difficult to dilute the mining rewards with a flood of asics.
@_date: 2013-05-02 09:45:13


That's what he said.
@_date: 2013-05-09 00:46:09
It wasn't really a complaint, just an observation that many people seem to have not noticed.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:18:04
This just reinforces the fact that people are using it as a (risky) stock and not a currency.  There's no other incentive to actually buy it to buy goods you would buy with cash anyways unless you're doing illegal dealings like buying/selling drugs on silkroad.  To mine it and sell it to some idiot who thinks it's worth 100 dollars and make a small profit... hey, there's a sucker born every minute!

Only .05?  I'm running a Radeon 7850 and get ~300Mh/s and have done about .05 a day the past week.

It's fun watching all the bitcoin tards cry about how their single pt of failure (mt gox) was taken down a peg.  I told them this time and time again and got severely downvoted and admonished for even suggesting it.  
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:53:14
Those people want something less volatile than the German Mark in the '20s or Zimbabwe dollar.
@_date: 2013-03-16 10:30:37
Yep... definitely *notascam* :P
@_date: 2013-05-03 00:15:42
So a short time passed and it went up again.  Try refreshing it again.  That's the thing about things that are super volatile;  it changes every minute.
@_date: 2013-03-15 06:57:23
I wonder how long before most people finally figure it out.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:12:55
This is a good reason why using this novelty as a currency is a joke.  With credit cards, you have recourse and chargeback options incase of fraud.  Here, you're screwed.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:50:22
That's not really a good deal since he would still be out 1BTC.  I'll get his 1btc back for only .5BTC.  
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:46:11
I thought only people dumb enough to fall for Nigerian e-mail scams did wire transfers like this.  Are you really that stupid?
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:16:46
If this exists, you guys should probably exchange your bitcoins for other cryptocurrencies like litecoin because when people discover they can't mine bitcoins anymore they will move to things that can't be mined with asic.
@_date: 2013-05-08 05:07:52
Or trust an exchange that oh... quotes wikipedia on their front page?
@_date: 2013-03-05 09:21:24
Likely market manipulation going on.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:44:26
Then buy them all back up and repeat.  It doesn't take much to game this market.
@_date: 2013-03-01 07:07:16
They only take btc or wire transfer as payment... that's already a red flag.  They could pack up and skip town tomorrow and nobody could do anything about it.  Also, look into who their CEO is and his criminal history.  I think most people know it and are playing that bubble like a game of hot potato.
@_date: 2013-03-01 00:57:53
Your stupidity is hilarious.
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:41:06
They will rake in lots of taxes from stupid speculators.  Of course they would.
@_date: 2013-05-08 07:35:29
And it's still there!
@_date: 2013-03-15 07:37:31
It's amazing how gullible some people are.
@_date: 2013-03-20 05:51:22
When will you guys finally realize it's a huge scam?
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:38:23
Same weird thing happened to me, I had a buy order for $55 and when it dipped to 50 a few days ago, I never got the buy, it just pretended like it didn't exist and the order is still there.
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:31:31
Link isn't the video, it's a spam ad.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:11:28
It's not a war, it's market manipulation.  Sell them all, ddos, wait for price to crash, buy back; wait a few months; rinse and repeat.  Profit.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:19:16
I can see more interest in Litecoin after bitcoin gets saturated with ASICs and nobody without them can mine anymore.  It uses the scrypt miner which has about 1000 times fewer hashes/sec and would be much more difficult to make an ASIC for.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:43:56
Quoting Wikipedia is hilarious.  How can anybody take that site seriously.
@_date: 2013-03-01 01:08:31
Seriously... what were you thinking.  But hey, if you want help catching the guy, I'm pretty familiar with freenode.  My fee is only 40BTC up front with money back guarantee.   My name is Jamal btw and I'm from Nigeria.
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:00:53
I kept getting bad gateway but I got it to load just now.  Price just dipped uner 100.
edit:  Not loading anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:33:08
Assuming BFL ships.   LOL
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:23:15
If you want to use a form of payment that has no recourse when somebody scams you then go ahead.  I'm still going to call you stupid though. :O
@_date: 2013-03-01 06:42:15
Because it's a scam.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:24:23
Because the makers of such hardware wouldn't just use it for a week to make the money they want to sell it for because... lol idk logic, what's that?  Surely they'll deliver!  I also am doing research and development for an ASIC to do 100GH/s with only 400 watts and would love to have 50 bitcoins each to secure yours when (if) I finally deliver!  How can you possibly lose!
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:08:52
They will because if people lose confidence in Mt. Gox, the price of bitcoins will crash and they make money by keeping the amount of trades high.
@_date: 2013-03-25 23:12:35
Mt. Gox getting hacked/played again could easily cause the bubble to pop any time.  Single points of failure like this and an unregulated volatile market makes this really shaky and some people are going to learn a very expensive lesson.
