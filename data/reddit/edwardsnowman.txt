A generic scenario their marketing department constructed sold you?  Really?

No.  My surprise comes from the fact that he saw such a transparent fabrication and immediately decided that was convincing enough to jump aboard.  That and his comment just screams "low-effort shill."
**Couple that with the fact that his account was created yesterday.  It's a fucking shill account.**
To spell that out in simple terms, since nobody else seems to be catching on:
He created that account yesterday in anticipation of today's post, participated in a few discussions to make the account have at least one page of activity, and then came here with the intention of looking like a typical user while posting an overwhelmingly positive opinion about the service, sprinkled with an additional description of what the service does in order to reiterate the concept of the service to the comment readers.

Yes.  This thread has a disproportional number of shills.
*EDIT:* My comment is getting upvoted here, but my previous comment pointing out one of the shills was downvoted to oblivion immediately after being posted.  The "Magic" people are using their shills to downvote all comments critical of their service.
I called out a shill **whose account was created yesterday**:
 .  My comment was immediately downvoted below the threshold.

It's for people who really stupid and/or really lazy.  They charge you a fee, or a "tip" as they call it to further insult your intelligence, to Google things and order things online for you.
This is what America has come to.  Sad.

He created his account two days ago, posted the comment yesterday, and deleted [his account]( today after seeing he was called out on it.  All that, plus the content of his comment, couldn't possibly make it any more obvious that it was a shill account.

You may have misunderstood me.  You said initially you didn't "care enough to look into it."  I was saying you don't *need* to look into it to come to any conclusions because I already stated all of the evidence right there.  It's obvious and clear as day that it was a shill account.  No further investigation necessary.
That said, this thread as a whole is an example of the subreddit getting gamed by marketers with bogus accounts.  Hopefully this won't become a common occurrence in for every little service that accepts Bitcoin for payments.

Stop oppressing me!!!!!!!!!!

Some would say discovered him.

50 Cent has some hip marketers.  He himself probably hasn't the slightest clue what Bitcoin is, though.

Tacking on "oh and I also accept Bitcoin" to the end of your title doesn't make this any more relevant to this sub.  Post this in or something instead.
