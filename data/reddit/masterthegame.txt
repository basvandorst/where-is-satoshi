Sorry kinda wanted to rant on this too cuz I'm high! I think we do agree, its just history is history and we dont know for certain or to the same extent as what happened. We just learn what we find and are taught. Gold is a money making business. The gold mining industry is nuts. Its sad when you google some of the pictures now. They gotta make a proffit and the last I remember in 2015 or so it was about $700 an ounce to mine. Then you have to refine. Then you have to mint. But ya its all just supply demand. Like bitcoin, mining rigs/ farms will be turned off if the price gets too low. Some people actually mine at a loss because they believe they'll actually make more in the long run. Interesting stuff

Keep in mind gold was illegal to own 46 years ago. Therefore there was no market for it. The central banks set its price

LMAO! OK Yes, I didn't know that. Fuck that guy. Im smoking a blunt right now. Literally!


I see what you mean but check this out, in the 30's and before price was set at around 20$ per ounce redeemable for physical gold at your bank. Then FDR made gold illegal, because wallstreet let WAY too many people trade on margin (credit) and when those margin calls came in and people couldnt pay their shares were sold to cover their margins and caused the market to crash hard. FDR was experiencing a crazy bank run because the market caused a panic which made everyone want their real gold. He made gold illegal, confiscated it, and then a while later changed the price of gold to around $33 per ounce. Then after gold became legal again because it was no longer money it became an asset thrown into the wild (like bitcoin). Gold was good for jewlery and a few other things but many knew about and didnt  like this new monetary experiment. That caused a new price discovery of a well known asset so a bubble occurred, just like bitcoin. Then it popped and continues its way in the market


EXACTLY! The Fed was enacted to do just that, they said controlling the currency would keep booms and busts from happening, but some say it's made them worse and more often. They said that as a lie because it's well known if you control the currency you control the people.


I dont understand that first part. Like were they illegal to keep offshore? Idk if we had that capability back then at a normal person level. But yes I believe the Rockefellers, Carnigies, Rothchilds, Morgans, etc had all types of everything. They were the multibiliionairs in todays value, many think they partly own the Fed which I really cant doubt because the Fed wont allow us to conduct an audit and keeps the owners anonymous. It makes sense because the government has borrowed money from a few of these families during the previous wars.
Its a crazy world thats been formed and its gonna be interesting to see how this plays out

In 33 gold was money... so how can money go up 50% a year - after it was legalized again it went through booms and busts just like any asset


OPEC can only fix the supply of oil production to a degree, remember only monopolies can fix prices -thats why they're illegal. But yes if you cut supply, prices will rise as demand for oil is relatively stable (remember the US broke up Standard Oil as they became a monopoly, which in turn created that oil cartel OPEC)


Again gold was Money... think of it this way, **if we never got off the gold standard  would one ounce of gold be +/- $1500 an ounce?!** 
The rate of inflation only came from the rate gold was mined from the earth


No. an asset's price is what someone is willing to pay for it. Gold was down to 1050 a couple years ago, i know cuz I bought some (I am a bit of a gold bug). It is true that miners wont work at a loss for long and the oil example you gave was spot on. When its profitable Texas starts pumping (I live in TX, so I know a lot of people in that industry and its crazy)


The law didn't have to forbid US citizens from owning gold certificates, onshore or off. The DOLLAR WAS A GOLD CERTIFICATE (it just was no longer redeemable) so it didnt matter where you kept your dollars, and there were international banking regulations set by the Bretton Woods conference that established the IMF which acted as a global coordination body between central banks which attempted that all other currencies be exchanged against gold (known as the US dollar)
But then... the Nixon Shock and the new currency was established in 1971 (they still called it the US Dollar) this is why people like me who like gold, bitcoin, and hard money in general take the time to write these posts to help educate. 
And dont be so hard on FDR. He was just a puppet for the people whom the US owed money to, the same people that created the Federal Reserve in secret, and the same who have set the monetary system to what it is today
I am not trying to put you down, just sharing what Ive learned. If any of those mentions were incorrect or if you disagree lmk

All the articles that have been posted declaring the end of bitcoin ��
When will folks learn and stop fighting?
@_date: 2019-11-05 22:52:05
Yes that is correct. Gold was possibly traded on the black market. But this point was about gold's value relative to inflation. Gold has been hoarded by the central banks and they set a dollar value to it as the dollar was pegged by the metal. Now when you talk about illegal substances the controllers such as drug lords, corrupt governments, etc... they want to unload the risky asset for currency as quick as possible therefore supply and demand was able to set the price. When central banks hoard something and set the price its different than the traditional supply and demand economics because the supply is relatively controlled/ diminished -kinda like the diamond industry
@_date: 2019-11-05 20:35:50
Yes that is correct. Any gold bullion such as bars, coins, etc. Small amounts of gold jewlery were legal. But if you had a treasure chest filled to the brim with gold jewelry it would have been confiscated. 3 years after the Nixon Shock gold bullion was able to be owned and traded again on open markets

I think the older generations prefer gold. No surprise there.
The younger generation for the most part prefer bitcoin. 
In 10 years much of the wealth the elders have will transfer to the millenials and GenZ
Therefore bitcoin would be a pretty safe bet
We've all seen what it's done in 1 decade. Imagine another ��

Yes the global monetary system needs a reset. The way it currently operates is unsustainable and is a house of cards waiting to fall...
The biggest threat the world is underestimating is climate change. Within 10-20 years a lot of the planet could become inhabitable, a lot of land will be underwater, ocean life could vanish, and if you think we have a lot of "natural disasters" now just wait. It will soon get out of control causing devastation throughout the world.
And being the petty humans we are, we're more concerned with how we're going to trade more fossil fuels...

I know me too lol. What if that was actually the case though? Like if the private keys were seriously lost...? Think they'd just make you sit in jail for eternity?

Good job for averaging in during the bear market. I had similar experiences during 2015 and 2016 just when bitcoin was moving flat until Brexit hit in 2016 and it started gaining speed. People would listen about it but brush it off. 2017 comes around and all of a sudden Im the expert. Just give it time and dont talk about it much

I dont own any bitcoin... or do I? If I do I purchased it otc with cash at a local mall and maybe a couple coffee shops with no KYC. I really didn't though. But wouldn't it be cool if I did? Jk I did...not
