I have to disagree. I know lots of people who have taken profits out of stocks and bought houses and crypto.

You misunderstood me. It can never get tipped in favor of buyers. For every buyer there is *always* a seller. The dollar transfered doesn't disappear, it always stays with the seller. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:10:06
How does that work? Are they saying the Japanese have been net btc sellers vs the rest of the world? It's a zero sum game.

You're an idiot. 99% of futures never expire and get rolled into another contract. Look at the volume that actually expired - it's about 30BTC worth. Pennies.

BTC has been going up because people have the disposable cash to buy it. People have free cash because the stock market has been rocketing up and the economy has been on fire. If we get a recession and a crash then disposable cash will disappear (like in 2008) and BTC (along with every other asset) will fall.

@_date: 2018-01-11 05:55:58
False. Buying crypto does nothing to the price of a dollar. All you are doing is transferring a dollar from a bitcoin buyer to a bitcoin seller. The dollar stays in the economy unaffected.

It's not 7% it's 14%. When you are self employed you pay the full 14%, when you get a W-2 the employer pays the other 7% but either way it comes out of your paycheck. $16k per year for 40 years is $600k. Guy is right.

You probably weren't around in 2014 during the bear market after the Mt Gox crash. There very much was a capitulation. Remember Peter Todd sold his bitcoins. There won't be a bottom until at least a few bitcoin maximalists publicly sell.

I think you are missing the point. You can't create money in a Bitcoin world, since the supply is fixed at 21MM. All you can do is redistribute it. But nobody will be willing to part with theirs.

You could have said the same when bitcoin was $1. Why didn't everybody front run it and push the price to $10k back in 2010? The reality is that adoption takes time. You need new holders of last resort to raise the price floor.

Not a chance. Silk road auction was 50k bitcoin and that was a large fraction of the free floating bitcoin. There is absolutely no way there is 20 times that much free floating bitcoin now - 95% or more is locked up in cold storage and not on exchanges. The exchanges just dont have 1 million bitcoin to sell.

Absolutely not. When you sell BTC for a tether, there is a buyer on the other side of the trade who gives you a tether. Zero tethers are created. 
The only time tethers are created is when somebody gives Tether Inc actual dollars. The fact that tethers are printed during dips is a clear sign of fraud. If anything, they should be creating tethers during bull runs when USD is flowing in from new investors.

You can already do that with multiple transactions, each with one input and one output using timelockverify. I don't see the benefit of doing that in one transaction (one input multiple outputs) but that is already possible as well.
