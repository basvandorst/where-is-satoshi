If you consider BTC etc to be currencies, then hyperinflation has led to far bigger wipeouts.

Actually, what makes bitcoin more valuable than any other alt-coin is the network effect (Metcalfe's Law). The more people that use it, the more valuable it becomes. Bitcoin's first mover advantage is huge.

It's not what you asked, but I got a Trezor and love it. Recommend.
@_date: 2015-12-24 07:17:35
Easy to do on either Bitstamp or Kraken. You will have to do the KYC/AML stuff though.
Edit: also, I really like the Trezor, because getting the BTC is only half the job - you have to keep it too. DON'T keep it on the exchange.

Good people, as far as I can tell.

Dubai is already pretty much out of oil, fwiw.

It's pretty slow.
There used to be a meetup at the Smokin' Pug in Bangkok on Mondays (if memory serves), but that was back when they were accepting BTC for payment. Last time I was there they weren't taking it any more.
Sway in Arena 10 is supposed to take it, but in practice I don't think they have much experience with it, so be prepared to pay cash too.
Eat Me definitely accepts BTC - I was there last week and the food / service was excellent.
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:20:41
That's interesting, but I'm not sure it makes sense.
The thing is that if they were in trouble and needed to make up cash they could have just arbitraged the difference in prices between Gox and the other exchanges. It would not have taken long to raise a few million dollars.
Remember - they were the only ones that controlled who got fiat out. If they sent fiat to a confederate who could buy on Bitstamp and then sell on Gox they would have made a fortune. Crashing the price and disrupting that opportunity makes no sense in that view.

Sometimes if you send the wrong currency it will end up in what is called a nostro account.
It's not at all uncommon and I wouldn't worry about it too much. 
For follow up with Bitstamp, make sure that you tell them the currency your bank sent the money in and the account you sent it to (along with any intermediary banks that you referenced). You might also ask them to ask their bank if it has ended up in a nostro account.
It will almost certainly help to ask your bank for a copy of the MT103 to send to Bitstamp as well (although some banks won't give that to you, *ahem*, HSBC).
Hope this helps, and again, don't panic...

There's more here:
That's astonishing if true - loss of more than 744,000 Bitcoin to theft?

Nice - good tip, thanks!

One way that I come up with a rough floor for the value of bitcoin is the amount of currency needed to replace outfits like Western Union or Paypal just in terms of transaction volume. That's about half a billion a day. BTC now has a market cap of more than 3 bil.

...but the time you were wrong it was because you thought you were wrong about something, but actually you were right about it.

It's coming in Thailand for sure... I've got a few people in Bangkok on it.
If you head back down to Bangkok, try Sway Urban eatery or the Smokin' Pug if you want to spend BTC. Great food and good people at both places.
I tried to send money to the Bitcoin address on that sign, but it is the URL for their spa, not a bitcoin address...

Being "long" on an asset means that you own it, not that you plan to hold it for a long time.
edit: it's the opposite of "short" an asset in which case you borrow it from someone else to sell on the market in the hopes the price will decline and you'll be able to buy it back cheaper before returning it to the person you originally borrowed it from.

As he squinted at the screen on bitcoinwisdom.com, Satoshi Nakamoto suddenly felt a surge of pride and a smug satisfaction that the price of a bitcoin had crossed the 1000 dollar threshold.
He sat back in his chair with a sigh.
With his 1.5 million bitcoins he was certainly the richest, if not only, bitcoin billionaire.
Truthfully, a certain amount of greed welled up within him and he briefly considered not selling any bitcoin because he knew that inevitably the price would rise further. But Satoshi had been around long enough to know that to second guess his plan was foolhardy at best. He had established his plan to sell at this price and knew that he had to stick to it for the good of the bitcoin ecosystem. It wouldn't do to have him too rich, after all - people were already starting to question his motives and altruism.
He leaned forward and pushed himself out of his chair and then stepped away from the warm glow of his computer monitor that now showed the price had already risen already to 1050.
He walked with a mixed feeling of excitement and trepidation to his closet to retrieve the laptop that held his fortune.
As he opened the closet his heart dropped when he realized that his wife had apparently tidied it up.
"Shit." he swore under his breath.
He gently closed the door of the closet and walked to the living room where he knew he would find his wife sipping tea and reading her favorite magazine without a worry in the world.
"Honey, what did you do with the stuff in the upstairs closet?" he gingerly asked, his lip trembling.
"Oh, I cleaned that out about a month ago. It was time to get rid of some stuff and I gave most of it to Goodwill."
Satoshi felt his knees get weak and stomach began to turn.
Without a word he turned back to go upstairs where he sat in front of his monitor again, eyes silently watering his magnificent beard.

What (s)he is saying is that all the information we need to make pricing decisions WRT the halvening are already well known. Not that it won't affect price, just that it won't affect price *in that moment*.

I'm not sure where you're getting your news from, but Facebook is _very_ profitable. Here is a link to the latest financials from the Fourth Quarter 2015 and Full Year 2015 Results:

It’s not possible. In fact, the USDT documentation makes it explicit that it is not redeemable for USD. If you need a source, pls use your Google-fu as I’m on mobile atm.
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:00:54
There is no, and there never was, a promise for redemption. The whole thing is a mirage until they come up with an actual audit. The price is moving up as people flee tether and then will quickly plummet when the people who were holding USDT convert to fiat. Caveat emptor.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:35:57
If they wanted BTC, they would’ve had that instead of the USDT they were holding. In other words, that was intended to be money of the sidelines. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:02:32
Yes, except everyone who was sitting on USDT who needs to buy BTC in order to make way to the exits showed a preference of USD over BTC. Otherwise they would've had their value parked in BTC already.
When these traders that want to hold USD move back out, the hangover could be severe.
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:06:21
Spoken like a true American. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:40:55
Nobody held on to USDT looking for capital appreciation. It’s a parking spot and transfer mechanism.

TL;DR: Patience, grasshopper.
It is still in process, but don't hold your breath... These things take time. I've never been involved in a bankruptcy like this before, but I have been the recipient of funds from several class action lawsuits and it is never a quick process.

Once again, I appreciate you taking the time to highlight these charities and bring attention to the BTC community.
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:06:16
This is a great list of worthy causes. Thank you for supporting the expansion of the community like this.

Slashdot for me as well.

It's wild that you do this... Thanks!
@_date: 2015-11-30 01:46:16
You'll have no problem buying that amount on any of the exchanges (Bitstamp or Kraken are both okay). If you buy in small lots (10k or so at a time) you should be able to pick it all up without moving the market much. The key is to be patient.
@_date: 2015-11-30 05:07:08
Right now the price on Kraken is 371.05/ 374.97 (bid/ ask). If I put in a market order to buy $100,000 it would push the price up to $400 per bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-25 05:37:18
I sent them a request about a year ago about the same thing - I'm very surprised that they don't have a more formalized answer by now.
What this means is that they are getting far fewer requests for BTC payouts than I would have imagined.
If you are an AirBnB user (host or traveller), take a moment to send them some feedback on this - they need to know that there is demand for it.
@_date: 2015-03-25 05:35:02
The thing that I find most interesting is how wrong the "haters" are about so many things. The first time I decided to buy some BTC was after reading a lengthy article about how the whole thing was flawed and realizing that the author was wrong on some level about pretty much every single point. When the people trashing something don't get it, that's a very, very positive sign for the future.

Good resource - thanks for putting this together and actively working to move the BTC community forward. We need more real action instead of the constant braying that we so often hear.
