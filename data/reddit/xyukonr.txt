Thanks everyone for the input! I was able to recover my bitcoin! Not sure what happened but someone replied here and wondered if Jaxx and Breadwallet were compatible which I'm not sure is the case or not but got me thinking. The trouble with breadwallet started after I rooted my phone. After restoring and syncing Breadwallet on my now rooted phone my balance was 0 and at the same time Breadwallet never assigned me a public key. I re-synced multiple times, letting it complet the long process and always the same conclusion; 0 balance and no public key. I installed Mycelium Wallet, put in my recovery phrase and still a balance of 0. Installed Jaxx on my laptop, put in my recovery phrase and still balance of 0. Anyways, my wife has Breadwallet on her stock Nexus 5. I tried putting my recovery phrase into her wallet and my bitcoin reappeared!! Funny thing is though, Jaxx is still saying my balance is 0 and the public addresses are different. SO glad I was able to restore my Bitcoin. Thanks again everyone!

Your reply got me thinking and I got my Bitcoin back! My wife has breadwallet on her phone. I restored my wallet on her phone with my phrase and my bitcoin returned! Thanks for getting me thinking! Still doesn't show up in Jaxx which I find strange...

Well the original wallet disappeared when I rooted and formatted my phone. I was under the impression I could just install it again and restore it with my phrase.

Yeah man I'm with you on that too! Love Bitcoin I think more for it's potential (ie disrupting oppressive economic systems) than hoping it will make me rich.

That's what I was wondering. I thought I may have gotten the seed wrong because I tried changing a few words and it wouldn't let me. When I changed the words back to the original list, it would accept them. I even used a tool to check the addresses created with my seed, and it tells you if you are using an invalid seed. Like if you use a wrong word or spell it wrong.
