Oh, they know this already. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 12:07:48
No, not yet at least.

Why are you trolling a Bitcoin forum?
I would guess it's because you have fears about the U.S. Dollar.
How cute.

Paying it forward, $9.98

It may provide them some legal standing later, I'd suggest.

I've never seen anyone in talk about violent overthrow. Not that I remember, at least. Trying to use violence against organizations that monopolize violence is a losing proposition, and most AnCaps recognize this. As a result, many believe in some sort of Agorist styled principle, being that counter-economic action is the route to eliminating states.

No, because individuals are their own on and off ramps, meaning that they can still engage in trade with one another even if the companies and organizations in the country can't. Bitcoin may be curtailed on a larger scale, but it can't really be banned entirely.

"*Currently, universities with a significant Austrian presence are George Mason University, New York University, Loyola University New Orleans, and Auburn University in the United States and Universidad Francisco Marroquín in Guatemala. Austrian economic ideas are also promoted by privately funded organizations such as the Mises Institute, and the Cato Institute.*" ([Source](

3 To assess who is interested, and how interested.

Is this a thing? It really needs to exist.
@_date: 2014-12-29 03:08:08
Sounds like a lot of rationalizing to make this somehow okay.

Drugs are bad, mmkay?

Nah, he's a genuine villain. But he's not alone. Most of the world's politicians are varying degrees of evil, even the most "benevolent" among them. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 12:23:02
It's the government. They (sort of) have a clue, but they know most of the people they're talking to don't.
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:34:15
Yes! Let's pretend that stuff wouldn't exist and people wouldn't get educations without stealing money from everyone to do it! We'd all be cavemen eating dirt if it weren't for taxes! Yay!

No argument from me. Just don't count on it being worth what you paid for it.

It is at odds with LE providers who force participants to use only its services, however. There are lots of reasons to be at odds with law enforcement as we encounter it today.

The free market cares about whatever the free market cares about, which may or may not include fraud and theft. 
Let the problem become pervasive and the provision of solutions to it become profitable enough, and the market will change its mind. Undoubtedly, there are individuals at this moment considering how they might profit from making Bitcoin more secure.

It's hard not to suspect that he keeps at it *because this scam works.*
@_date: 2015-04-05 12:54:26
Well, I'm glad we're all *certain* that the government will follow it's own rules. Surely they'll just stick to the list, even when it's to their favor to stretch beyond it.
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:05:47
Well, whomever can solve that problem for the "idiots" stands to become a very, very rich individual.

When he slings things like that about, it makes the entire rest of his article come into question.

Even that may not be entirely safe in the future. ("[badBios](
"Three years ago, security consultant Dragos Ruiu was in his lab when he noticed something highly unusual: his MacBook Air, on which he had just installed a fresh copy of OS X, spontaneously updated the firmware that helps it boot. ... A computer running the Open BSD operating system also began to modify its settings and delete its data without explanation or prompting. His network transmitted data specific to the Internet's next-generation IPv6 networking protocol, even from computers that were supposed to have IPv6 completely disabled. Strangest of all was the ability of infected machines to transmit small amounts of network data with other infected machines even when their power cords and Ethernet cables were unplugged and their Wi-Fi and Bluetooth cards were removed."
