Cashed out my original investment, paid the interest and cashed out a few more times my original investment. Semi made it refers to the fact that I could have made it, cashed out hundreds of thousands during the 2017 bullrun but instead only cashed out some and held the rest to the ground. Ouch

The simple things are already very difficult; wallets,private keys, seeds, satoshis etc. All the newbies I know simply buy on the exchange, and hold it there (“it’s only a few hundreds, I dont mind losing them etc”
Don’t even get me started on something like setting up LN. It is virtually impossible for the average Joe

Best case scenario: the 2019 bar will show $3500. Not so impressive
Worst case scenario: the 2019 bar will be lower than $3200 :(
