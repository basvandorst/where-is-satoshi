right...smart money bit from a few years ago...forgotten about this one
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:30:01
not even gonna check. if you have to come here and ask, it's a scam!!!
@_date: 2019-12-21 12:56:43
...ves to  sound money. there, I fixed it for ya. yeah, I know, it's new!!!
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:01:52
what is the practice? are your funds kept hostage?
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:14:01
then it's just a matter of you not understanding the exchange's filters. also normal that you dont.
@_date: 2019-12-18 05:03:33
you are all over the place hoping for a better entry...
@_date: 2019-12-21 17:05:46
nice scam
@_date: 2019-12-20 11:22:41
yes, but patent
@_date: 2019-12-31 18:49:19
I went through a similar experience with Changelly. My deal was through Trezor exchange platform. Trezor got involved and had a good outcome. Thank you for sharing, keep us updated, it is important we see the trends. Coinswitch and Exodus BIG NO!!!
@_date: 2019-12-31 19:44:54
changelly not safe. check my story:   [
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:56:36
nope, that is it. I entered crypto space 2 weeks ago and I am heavily invested in crypto, almost $100.
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:25:42
yet still...
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:11:16
I think not. I would also be interested for something that works with adwords
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:26:31
So, you think by security and keeping wealth safe I meant less volatility? I couldn't care less about volatility. I know how it feels government and banks middling with your own wealth, and telling you what you are allowed to use it for, and where. So, if banks are out, all the alt(shit)coins are out. Bitcoin is only good for miners, tell us mister productive, where do we keep our wealth...you know...the rest of us that don'y play with pocket change, and are not day traders whores? under the mattress? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:43:19
Anyone can get lucky on a few bets. You know the key to browsing private jets catalogs? Buy BTC and hold. THERE IS NO OTHER FORMULA!
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:52:45
- service
- claim tool
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:38:01
so you're in his shoes too..how does it feel in fiat over there? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:04:42
yet cu keep fudding in hope for a better entry point. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:46:50
This is no place to talk alt coins Report!
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:56:05
A+ LOL
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:08:52
Dudes have all their wealth in fiat. I would call it poison too. Instead I have everything in btc, for me fiat is cancer. It's just a matter of protecting your wealth, the arguments have nothing to do with anything.
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:35:41
you really shouldn't give your opinion out there. there might be some (other?) mentally disadvantaged to read this crap.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:18:41
I'll be here with my dick in my hand...attached still (or not :D )
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:14:28
I've been all in since $200 level. You know the key to prv jet? HOLD, don't time the market. Your advises can be speared ;)
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:22:22
just listened to the ultimate crap...5 minutes I will never get back.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:59:09
we can always print more
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:07:01
FUCK YEAH!!! I hope they do, I've been waiting to exit that position for ages. I hope it pumps real nice.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:08:24
what a retard. I am not gonna type the same things. Read the rest of the replies. Other whores tried the same old angle. It feels like you are not even trying.
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:41:25
absolutely 
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:58:53
You'll give me an opportunity? Am I here asking for something? I think you might be mistaken me for someone that gives a fuck about your approval. Are you retarded or somthing? Can't you read. I said 10k by monday. Where did I say anything about any dip? Again, Are you retard? Did I say I ever sold? And "this site" is full of holders (them) ridiculous rich, you know why? They weren't whores looking for a $100 price swing difference to afford dinner. They were holding and holding and...yes, you got it now, even as slow...holding still.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:32:07
I'll eat the fucking thing raw, bleeding, if we don't hit 10k.
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:39:05
have to? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:05:35
oh, I didn't catch your bulshitting earlier. you are one of those whores, looking for a better entry. Sure, it can, but also it cat shoot up and leave you with your dick hanging. I wonder if btc is that in the shadow now, to stay in sidelines for more than 2 weeks. It feel like you are not even trying. Remember how much last dip lasted? No? Short memory?
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:59:37
right...because your crystal ball is that good
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:01:26
no worries, I know how to cut off my own dick, duh!!
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:57:21
co.uk?? yeak!
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:41:06
whores! :(
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:30:39
not a maximalist by far. deluded...hmmm...how come?
EDIT: also noob? I missed that one? Define noob? My first purchase was when mt gox was a thing...Indeed I missed the big train, but I moved all in in bitcoin not because of getting rich from the rise, but because of freedom that was offering, being able to decide on my wealth, without the government option to seize my shit. It just happened that the rise made me ridiculous rich.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:48:41
good read.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:10:27
LOL, agreed!
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:04:01
You have no idea how GREAT my life is. NO IDEA :)))))))) Again with the prick? Didn't I just admit it? And forget about bitcoin? How does that work? You are taking my badge or something?
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:30:39
And that is why you'll be left with your fiat in one hand and your dick hanging, loosing sleep for thinking past bear market guarantee the same time frame. again, another whore, already tried all of this. Read above, you are just saying what he said 20 min ago. You have won the clown contest so far. Keep it coming dude. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:55:53
no no...you don't lack vision...you are just plain stupid, but not your fault..it's a nature thing...so, security it's worth shit to you...you think real wealth can be held in any shit coin? The fuck is up with all the retards lately?
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:04:59
:))))))))))) still a better method than any TA
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:39:37
in this case, it is the only way.
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:05:46
This is an inside job. Someone in your house does not like your crypto passion. This is in no way a Trezor security breach.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:21:12
:))) hi bro. still not in yet? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:36:52
right, but we are talking about us citizens...big shortage of that...
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:17:58
then all is good in the universe :)
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:35:46
I was thinking war as well
@_date: 2018-03-10 04:26:40
so another type of FUD then ;)
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:31:26
I loled
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:48:28
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:27:55
I am not saying every time. I am saying now ;)
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:41:47
sir, it's not big, I'm telling you, full disclosure. It gets me going though.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:02:59
Any time during Monday if it hits 10k, my dick stays attached.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:13:36
right...because if you called me son, you have established yourself an authority, is it now? And how about it. Are you that retard to compare those times, with the shitshow and media attention and governments attention, and banks attention this time btc is getting? Yes, retards like you might help the price going down for $100, but to be in an extended bear market, the entire crypto world would just have to disappear and everyone loose interest. Can you elaborate, on what would that extinction be based on?
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:11:28
You be a retard and end it, or judge bitcoin's history and check when did it never recover. I personally hope you chose the first option ;)
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:37:32
I have my tin foil hat on. With all the cartel theories around, I feel like anyone is trying to fuck bitcoin, and indirectly my wealth. So, you say stupid things, you are being treated like a dumb fuck, until the price recovers, at least.
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:51:29
yeah, you need a friend to help you out with a new email to open a new account, just for appearances.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:24:14
dude, you know you are full of shit with all this TA...it never worked EVER on btc market, and I have been around when mt gox was a thing. stop fuding everyone with this bull shit, hoping no one will call you.
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:31:13
you should worry china not to sneeze on usa army, it might catch a cold.
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:30:20
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:55:57
true that brother!
@_date: 2018-03-19 06:33:21
eh...I've been through worst. 3-4 years ago was the same, people bragging with 200%. I have chosen the lazy, not trading whore, holding option...you know, the one that allows you to browse private jets catalogs. But hey, 200% is good as well, if you want to keep your mcdonalds job your entire life ;)
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:56:38
so...fuck decentralization for 2.0
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:30:24

@_date: 2018-02-17 01:42:10
thank you. yeah I have heard about them...every now and then...somehow they don't seem too impressive...sometimes I make them buy me coffee...btw, where did you read about them? I love the whales stories.
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:21:09
hard to stay on top of everything :D
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:23:20

@_date: 2018-02-22 14:10:04
very cool listen
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:41:55
then change the background why tf would you put that shitcoin on the background? Until then you are shilling. 7 minutes btcp background for 10 sec advice? move your coins! that's it...all your 7 min video.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:23:01
same deal. and yeah bitaddress won't do it. I looked for an alternative myself. no luck.
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:51:16
me: This would be so fun to watch the next couple of years you: literally nothing will happen, stop betting on an apocalypse

She was just a lot smarter than you but too emotional. Maybe together you would have made a great team and complete each other...you know like a family. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:19:04
Sorry, can't point you to some specific. I believe you are a IPhone guy (assuming you are from usa). On android you can find lots.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:01:53
lol, agreed. quite a long description for just a +1
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:56:54
this is what you get for being stupid and not checking the needed fee
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:55:19
Hey, not my native language, I can afford a few errors. How many languages do you speak? And yes I'm an ass, cannot disagree. Me being an ass, doesn't change the facts. Also luck has nothing to do with it, it was a counter measure against my government wanting to seize all my shit :D
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:36:51
I am rude because the way he formulates his sentences it's a clear sign his intentions are to create FUD. When I'll see something worth a debate, or some good arguments, I'll pull my guns and not LAMBOS.
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:20:34
And your arguments are, because you say so? I was in Greece promoting bitcoin at a very interesting point in time...saw something that opened my eyes. This being said..it's sucks to have your wealth in the wrong place, doesn't it? You base your theory on wishful thinking.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:18:43
fair, it was rude on my part...sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:58:00
:))) what a sorry fuck you are :)))) you would suck a dick for a few bucks lower, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:16:28
bitcoin can hit any price because of the FUD from all the retards. That doesn't mean that money is going anywhere besides the sidelines. There is no better option, unless you wanna try to time the market. I bought my stash at $200 level, and I have been through all the FUD there is. The money ALWAYS comes back in, and the only ones getting fucked...you know who they are: day traders and panic sellers. Moneys doesn't leave this space. Just stays sidelines. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:40:25
You can value at whatever the fuck percentage you want. Thing is, who the fuck cares about your value, to sell you at that price?
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:03:47
if you think hiding the money from the banks, inside the banks is easy, then go ahead,try....I understand them because I tried that once, when I was denined their services. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:05:13
fuck yeah you are!!!
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:12:04
lol, right. tell me a bit about the tech then...it might be that you are so slow, you cannot process what you read...if you still think btc is going down with all the new innovation in this space, you are really slow. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:09:45
My apology then, but someone already answered.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:16:51
you can see by the way he expresses his concern he is just a sad fuck looking for a better entry, with no understanding the market whatsoever. he knows he is full of shit, he just hopes others don't.
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:51:08
I am sorry but the other coin is doing much better (look at coinmarket today) shh...I think I will have one more chance to dump that shit, don't ruin it for me PLEASEEE
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:03:50
I don't day trade...too afraid of exchanges. Just take positions from time to time.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:03:59
LOL, agreed
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:36:00
lol denied? you just got to love TA
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:14:23
please enlighten us with more advices. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:24:02
dude, you are too stupid to be alive...you've demonstrated shit...you can very well not agree with me, but not pt words into my mouth. I told you to shut the fuck up if you cannot sustain a discussion without making up things like "by my definition" and cherry pick comparisons. I do not reconsider shit. When I said well educated I was referring to the fact that I understand the definition of hypocrisy, and I know how to avoid one. You ps was so funny I actual had to look up what the fuck that means. Such a bad profiling, I do not know where to comment, I really do not understand how is that related. I live in a country where if you drive a little too aggressive you risk to get shot on the spot, and I love it here. I made my fortune by picking on the strong ones, and avoiding picking on the weaker, it has nothing to do with social protection. I am on reddit because I have all my wealth in btc and some brigades are trying to manipulate the price which is in direct conflict with my position. Therefore if I cannot solve the problems like I am used to, because as you stated it's the internet, then I try to comment on those fuckers. Now, you being as retarded as you are, don't understand that all I said was for me it is offensive, and then I got trolled (very aggressive I might add) by some sad fuckers, and most of my anger came from their approach towards me. Sure, when I get mad, because is not my native language, I tend to type fast, and translate word by word from my language, and that might confuse the conversation. But to go and say that I social protect anything, this is where I smiled and understood you were a bad profiling. I said for me it was offensive, then the discussion turned to alpha vs beta. I stated that picking on the weaker ones shows insecurity, and not alpha. And yes, my lifestyle sais that if a 150 kg, 2 m long guy picks on an old lady and spit into her face, then I have found my target (if you really needed a cherry pick example). If a successful couple with millions starts to make fun of a young couple because they sit in the rain and cannot afford to buy a car, then I have found my target. If that fucker OP would have made a silly joke about bill gates, I would have never considered offensive...and you don't have to agree, I don't give a fuck it's my opinion..today I learned again how facktard America is. And I guess this is why your country protects you for the likes of me, and we are not allowed in :)))) you should really thank your social protection, you would have gotten burned alive.
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:54:26
right, why not 7k? I think your crystal ball is fucked up dude. mine sais 7k 
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:46:18
came here to read this.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:14:35
oh, it's you again. can you tell us the number of posts today about this fud? :)))) I told you before. It will feel even worst. Can't you understand this angle is long smoked? People here already know that, the price is still climbing. You are just a sad fuck that missed the train and now hopes to do some damage maybe, just maybe the price goes to previous low. You'll have better changes begging for money, people here won't fall for this shit. You are just assuming, with no facts whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:59:50
you sir, are a clown
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:58:03
paxful is a joke, run by scammers owners. Check google about them selling the bch fork and not crediting their users.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:07:13
Because it's time to correct some sorry fucks, that don't get enough attention, and explain to them, as uneducated as they are the difference between secure and insecure.
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:56:04
yes, I am working on that.

@_date: 2018-02-21 02:41:11
No worries, I am here to correct. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:12:43
omg, thank you for that laugh. here comes the TA guys with their crystal ball shit and their double dip and triple resistance :)))) alt TA, right? We should all be millionaires 
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:33:02
you mean my prv jet?
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:55:46
lol, this is not the place to shill. shut the fuck up with your I didn't hear about the other 200 forks before this magical one. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:31:02
dude, you are shilling for btcp, hiding your advertising intentions through some lame advices everybody here know. This is the place for you:  REPORT!
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:42:00
right...so true intentions with your warning...no fud...it hurts that you waited too long, doesn't it?
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:07:41
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:20:24
lol, it went down $300 after going up $1000 :))) here comes the fudsters
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:07:42
And this is how noobs learn not to give their heard earn bits to these fuckers. Hope you guys didn't fell for this brigade. check out heir history. They do this all the time.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:59:44
they are kicked out by the police every time. so funny
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:16:41
because not everybody has (just?) $100 invested in crypto, and to keep real money (amounts?) in anything but the king...
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:56:47
If the target was weaker, of course I would. It's called bullying, and I don't need a lesson in hypocrisy, I am well educated. Edit, I misread, so to add: If that joke was directed to a weaker couple than the one saying the joke, again, yes, very.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:18:12
lol, at least you gave it a try. not a good one, this theter angle is long smoked...you are late to the party, all the real fudsters bought in, you are alone in a very long bull run...:))))
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:50:52
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:57:00
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:25:52
a "poor" shmuck 
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:20:42
paxful is a joke, doesn't return people's money. They took the bcash from the fork sold it, and din't credit the users...lol...
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:38:32
fuck yeah!!!!
@_date: 2018-03-03 08:00:16
If you got your prv key from a hd wallet to electrum, I think electrum  does not provide a correct wif prv key - at least this is my conclusion.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:09:14
hey, if you are honestly interested, I can show you the shit show that is going on when a pump or dump is announced. they burn each other on the same team, because it's a sure thing knowing the moves beforehand, and having a different agenda. I understand the developer point of view, but those guy are not friends, and everyone is part of all the clubs...sure everyone has a team in the background, a team that acts according to the whale, not according to a fixed algorithm. You said you worked for whales. Were you instructed what actions to take or you did the bets according to your algorithms? Did you ever try to tell your boss: but boss, I think we should not...because my math says otherwise. Or maybe this is how you got fired? :D:D
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:10:52
lol, again with ta shit
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:06:13
wallet.dat should be the file to import. If you don't have it, then there is no wallet. You might also have the private key (that long character string). Then import as private key. Do not paste that string here until. If it's the private key then it will be stolen.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:45:45
the fuck are you talking about, you are dumb as fuck. How can you say there bitcoin is no better than 2016? Boy, read some about the tech and GTFO of here, stupid clown.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:28:10
If you have the prv key, you are good to go. nothing lost. Download electrum wallet and import wallet with prv key. Let it sync for a few minutes, and you should have the balance from 2012
EDIT: you did not have bitcoins on your pc ever. just a key to access the coinbase of btc.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:23:31
comon, read above...agree with you, not a nice person, I made sure about that.
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:40:04
I also can eat a lot of shit, and say you eat dinner. But your breath will give you away.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:30:01
my dick is not big, and everything that matters is still up...so everything
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:12:08
lol, another one that missed the train waiting for $5k. Jump in, it will only feel worse.
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:03:02
what's with all these post today?  only a retarded person would think otherwise
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:56:22
LOL, thank you for that sir :)))) I needed that laugh. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:42:33
sir, you have established yourself a truly fucking clown.

you want me to say you? she made the very best choice, than got caught in all the fud and sold at a bad time. I bet a lot of that heat came from you. Most probably instead of trust you just ranted like you do now. taking the kids from their mom does not yell smart
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:31:44
you can sleep well knowing you at least tried. btw, I know you missed your chance, but waiting longer will only fuck up your mood :D
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:38:32
This should calm down the fudsters using this angle...but have no fear, they will come with something else.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:01:56
LOL, here comes the gang. How does it feel trying to get even $100 lower just because you missed your entry point and now you are loosing sleep, knowing you fucked up big time. You day traders whores are the only one playing this game. You are stealing from each other, no btc holder will fall for this FUD...it's been done over and over, it's much like China bans bitcoin with you...nobody fucking cares, you are not even worth replying to.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:48:51
so, not so perfect analogy after all...and why don't you go invest in whatever the fuck you want. I know, I know...maybe, just maybe you get to make another $100 no matter how much shit you have to eat. Hey whore, I can tip you that much, just so I won't see you around for a while.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:48:54
my crystal ball says no. where do you get your predictions?
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:36:31
I did that, can't go wrong with that move.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:56:44
cocaine lemon mixed, no doubt
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:17:56
This will be fun to watch when every fudster will take any angle just because they waited too long to hop in.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:23:12
I am sorry, I don't understand (not trolling) what you are asking me. they were subpoena and didn't close shop. They were audited by the friedman llc, and they closed their audit, but the guys that audited never said there was something suspicious. it's really hard to hide money from the banks, inside the banks, especially when they had BIG problems...at one point all the banks denied them services. My best guess they are using banks and deposits all over the place, through so many companies, so the track is not that obvious...and my guess this is why the audit ended, because quote: the procedure was excruciating"
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:53:33
fuck yeah!!!

@_date: 2018-02-21 00:28:49
what is there to learn? ta? :)))))
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:50:58
I bought all the way down from 1k to $200 about 5% of my stash, and when it hit $200 I sold everything and went all in. You either understand the tech and revolution that comes with it, or speculating on short term. My method worked out great so far, I've exceeded my wildest expectations from life, and during this time I've experienced all the fud and the scams and the manipulation that is natural in this space. Only time I've moved my coins was In Jan, this year, to claim my forks.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:40:55
I think we all know about "Alpha" man being so insecure that they feel the need to make fun (or approve) on other people expense.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:37:42
I have my own crystal ball, thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:59:56
I took a similar step at $200. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:54:22
localbitcoins.com-&gt;cash option. Meet the person, give the bits, get the cash, spend it...cash out only what you need, leave the rest in btc...Jeez..people is running to btc for safe keeping and you go the other way around. For buying houses and shit like this, get the fuck out of USA, it's the worst place you can be. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:55:59
I recommend for conversion. Just finished those 2 coins myself.
And for his legendary script.
And the place for your post: 
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:52:59
I saw it...unfortunately everyone there was against Juan, and it's hard to keep up with all the questions. Roger is a very experienced scammer and that skill comes in handy on a debate like this. There should have been at least another pro btc person there to help Juan...I agree, it did not goo to well...on the other hand, like you said, who wants to learn about tech, can go ahead and read...a debate is just a debate. Also the most important part was the finale, where a very good point was brought to the table...the one were there will come a time where all crypto world will be force to join forces against governments crack downs...let's hope till then everyone grows his coin enough, so together there is a fighting chance.
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:42:11
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:01:19

edit: it's not just bcash guys, it's everyone against Juan. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:17:15
you are truly retarded. check LN
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:30:53
LOL, wait what? :)))) just putting some random shit to make it seem smart? I whish I had a beta personality, it would have saved me some problems over the years. This being said, don't quit your day job for profiling.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:48:30
wow, that upsets me deeply. thank you for correcting me, now I have to get out of the alpha male club.
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:09:31
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:51:18
Hey, I happened to love a good scammer. This is why I held onto beech...roger thing...but he is kinda of dropping the ball now...tell him to PM me if he abandoned bch so I'll know I'll get out as well.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:19:02
LOL, I hope you are a troll...else just truly imbecile. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:06:01
LOL, what the fuck did I just read? no way people are falling for this shit...you got to love the fudsters looking for a better entry.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:23:23
same here brother...all in house and everything on $200
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:25:09
lol, you are in a point where I could troll you, I really thought about that for a minute..probably would have been my first time with intention. dude, re-read my post...defending a country when you called it communist and shit, has nothing to do with your rant. good luck with your (what are you doing here?).
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:25:50
if that 36 string wallet didn't work, then it's not a private key. And yes, if you put 32 digit string (receiving address), you will create a watch only...which means exactly that. You are doing the right steps, but it appears you do not have the prv key. But, when you get the watch only address, does it show any balance? If the balance is zero, then there is no reason to figure this out.
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:58:12
LOL, that is some serious non sense shit
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:15:30
brother, I thought I was subtle enough, but now you are either slow, or you are fudding. How can you believe all whales buy and sell at the same time, using the same strategy? How can you think the whales are after burning your $100 investment and not after another real chunk of money? Your logic makes me think you are not over 16 yr old, and if that is the case I apologies for being rude. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:48:50
:)))) so now because you feel sick to your stomach, for the low entry you could have gotten into, everyone correcting you is a fraudster...I am telling you, it will only feel worst...I've been around since mt gox (it was my first crash)...I've seen them all, you will go straight to and complain on how ridiculous this market is :)))))
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:04:37
lol, you guys are not even trying anymore
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:53:40
It's time for Coinbase to fuck up bitcoin's price again.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:32:27
I am fighting depression 3 years already. You are just not smart enough to understand. re-&gt;reverse if you missed that one.
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:31:21
I've read today some really strange stories about coinbase taking money out of people's accounts. Now this? They give money back where they shouldn't? LOL, I guess they really fucked up this time.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:46:35
just because you are slow, I will let you have this one. not everyone can afford to move large amounts into exchanges. for me it's a no go, I value my coins too much to take that risk of loosing them....
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:06:54
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:19:26
This doesn't make sense, maybe you can rephrase.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:27:25
Dude, I am laughing now...Are you kidding me? I have in front of me private jets catalogs just browsing.. because I took this path.
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:32:35
funny you mentioned rights.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:41:08
so...slow then. This amazes me...over the time I have corrected other that understood pretty fast that ... let me sum up.. so you believe millions of whales all over the world, have diners together and make plans for when to buy and when to dump, having the same agenda, no enemies, just friends all is good in the univers?
EDIT: and what is with you CV? I am not trying to hire you, but instead I can tell you I am part of the biggest whales clubs out there, and it's s hit show...a real shit show...more often than not, they burn each other on the same team.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:03:32
For sure. It appears you have no idea why Bitfinex was forced to create tether. Banks all over the world denied them accounts.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:46:21
27 minutes and still up? mods must be sleeping :D
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:20:32
why not? you based your theory on wishful thinking? day traders will forever take their gains and will forever miss the big launch. Seen this over and over. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:08:30
yes, a 20% in 24 hours can only go down, according to your logic. sir, this is why you are gonna be a poor fuck for the rest of your life. ;)
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:35:51
:))))) again, it will only feel worst, as you see, there were anti fudstaers brigade, that don't even correct you guys anymore, it's not worth it. You ar e only a few sad fuckers that believed into that FUD, and waited WAY TOO MUCH!!! cboe cme LOL FBI LOL :)))) dude, wake up, you are in a very strong bull run, this is the last time you will see these low prices...look at 2017 what happened, it is the exact same pattern....and this time we have LN, no more high fees, just everyone waiting for their LAMBOS
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:58:55
that is some serious non sense shit TA my friend...you won the contest
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:11:45
all the good names are already taken by all the shit forks. :D
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:26:40
of course there's a new angle to fud, especially when you missed the entry. I was afraid fudsters are gone.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:21:48
sir, I am a man of my word. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:32:47
:)))) wait a little longer and you won't be, if you cannot read the tech innovation in the crypto space, it's ridiculous to point you in the right direction. don't forget, this time we have LN, we are ready!!! 
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:43:10
waiting to dump that shit first hand
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:27:18
holly shit...this is why you can still hear the term early adopter. these old furts will never put the effort into reading about the tech behind all this. they need to die first so younger people come to the table.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:48:09
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:55:30
welcome, but you should leave btc aside for a while, it's not for you...go back to usd.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:33:27
I'll take a look. thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:09:46
Be careful to not have gotten into a phishing scam email. Check the real balance on coinbase before releasing your goods.
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:09:29
Hey, first, I 'm just an ass, that's my thing, it has nothing to do with this community. I cannot talk about the future, but anything else that's out there is junk, although I am invested 20% in many shitcoins, just for fun (you know...free money from all the forks). Yes, there will be something to replace bitcoin. A better, improved bitcoin. LN so far, is the best shit invented, after bitcoin. Tell me any shitcoin that comes close to btc and we can debate. Sure, we could imagine a world where aliens land on earth and bring better tech. But basing our future prediction on the present tech and development, BTC was, is and will be THE KING
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:25:25
I've been all in since $200 level, and I mean sold my hose, my cars and everything I could turn into fiat...so thank you for the advise, I was one step ahead ;) And yes, throw a little bit of TA shit maybe you can find some clueless guys around to fall for this nonsense. I was talking $100 down (further) with your help, because this half assed FUD won't do much. And again with the guys that bought in at 19k? It was ages ago, do you retards still use that angle? The fuck, you are not even trying.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:01:55
so you are repeating what the other guy said. what are you two? a group of alpha males petting each other and day dreaming on how beautiful would actually be if aggressive, uncivilized, uneducated fucks, picking on the weaker ones, would actually be considered alpha?

@_date: 2018-02-21 13:56:47
guess it's a matter of volume combined with wanting a little freedom to run your business.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:44:02
it hurts, doesn't it? I can prove I have never moved my coins since $200, just once to claim forks, but I am in the possession of both wallets. I would say a bet for...30 btc? fuck, I'll even let you choose the number to bet...maybe you are a better gambler than I.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:31:06
everyone knows that...or I will eat my dick EDIT: oh, he meant the mining costs...didn't read
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:44:21
yeah, stay tuned, this guy also day dreams :))))
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:09:30
You got to be a bit slow not to have found out about LN yet, but to have an opinion on that.

@_date: 2018-02-25 16:53:55
no, no...he is dead on. you're just stupid. I bet you know shit about the tech behind this magic money, or else you would understand that layer 2 is the only option. Might be LN is not the savior (although it might just be the second best after btc invention)...but layer 2 is the only way to scale.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:46:39
We didn't win the war on banks (yet), but we are about to start a war on governments. I don't think we are prepare for that.

can you please enlighten us on your 2k btc true price opinion? you got to love the fudsters
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:28:53
that was clever...and offensive as fuck.
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:05:26
which coin would that be? btc is the first to scale, ethereum hasn't implemented shit yet, and the others...common..you are an idiot to think there is a coin so step up.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:03:51
this is a healthy correction, day traders taking profits. The price will be on it's way up in a few days.

I know, I am not trying, just using the same shit no arguments the brigading did when the price was crashing. It feels so good to just say shit that doesn't make any sense. LAMBOSS...did you ever read the shit they were saying (and probably you) when the price was dropping, and all the noobs felt for it? How does it feel now?

@_date: 2018-02-15 21:12:52
dude, coinbase is not gonna scam anyone. they fucked up a little bit...it was about time...they seem to always fuck up and bring down btc price, whenever there's a bull run.

they sometime do, when the other person assumes all kind of shit. By my definition? I think you should let me decide whom I consider weaker, you are just another sorry fuck that tries to twist my words. Edit: you are the one to put a weak vs strong comparison into a cherry pick example, so it makes you look good. For me, the joke was an offence. You give me another example and I will tell you what I consider, but please, don't put words in my mouth. If you can't handle a discussion, shut the fuck up.

I am trying to understand what is your angle here...I might say a little fud, but it's poor one so maybe not this...trolling...maybe...I got a bit emotional thinking you don't understand...if you are looking for attention, again, not the best angle to use...so ...slow I guess.
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:53:51
btc no doubt. it's the oldest.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:22:26

Don't judge a country until you have visited it (at least as a tourist).
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:21:17
lol, missed your chance, haven't you?
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:06:06
:)))) what is core? never heard of it. beecash is in a big pile of shit, I am afraid it won't last 4 months, and I won't get the chance to dump mine :( I waited sooo long...eh...a shitty fork is a shitty fork...
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:35:09
no brother...government- best thing could have ever happened to me...now browsing private jets catalogs :))))
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:16:09
you hope, don't you? :)))) you also hope you will see again low prices, so it won't feel so bad that you missed your entry point.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:21:48
you can find on google store. coinmarketcap
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:31:25
I cant help but notice you have given zero arguments on your opinion. Just because you say people are naïve for thinking different, does not make you smart(er)...on the contrary. If people will be allowed to use crypto, there is a plus for Venezuelans, it doesn't really matter if the country per se will rise.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:48:37
LOL, who is we? you are the only sorry fuck that missed the entry point. the sentiment here is positive. Hope in or it will feel worst by day.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:25:54
it seems that way, doesn't it? especially when you missed your entry point. who knows, some dreams fulfil, but day dreaming is not a price prediction.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:49:54
shhh, they will hear you :))))
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:31:55
they didn't buy LAMBOS? :(
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:37:49
yes. In the payment link, after invoice add -noscript and hit enter
something like 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:29:06
it might be that you think it's not a continuous action? they fork but they don't go live the moment they fork.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:43:43
lol, I always wondered, do you guys believe in the crap, or you are just using it in hope you find some clueless guy that thinks TA is for the smart guys, and not for the FUD whores
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:08:03
Your bitcoin address (the one you give to people to send money) is not the same as your private key. If you only have your bitcoin address, then you don't have anything. Either wallet.dat or private key.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:40:53
and we found ourselves another whore. No, like it did the last time from 6k.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:58:38
not a chance. and never will :D
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:22:33
I made sure I was being an ass while slipping an advise. No person in distress will ever hug the person that bullies him, but do the opposite.
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:29:13
welcome. it seems that you have your btc stored on coinbase, and most definitely they are not lost.
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:44:28
these would be my first 2 questions as well
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:10:29
I don't know if that's sarcasm, but where I actually live to know at least 3 other languages besides your own, it's a must to survive.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:39:15
I cannot believe how organized this fuckers are :)))) read all the comments and then check out their history. This should bring you some peace.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:28:16
dude, this is not the place to marketing, I gave you the correct link. now I see you are spamming. go away with your shit coin.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:56:10
Again, different whales, different interests. The whales go to war on each other more often than you think.
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:05:49
it's called arbitrage.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:38:39
I have been, since $200
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:10:49
yes, you cannot work a business like you would in a more civilized country. Personally I prefer to do business with the common folks, than to suck a senator's cock to get some weird approval. You have to tip now and then to get things going. You only get stuck if you have a civilized country mentality and try to apply those rules to a poorer one. EDIT: also assuming you are English based native language, what other languages do you speak so you expect other countries to know yours. You visit that country, it's nice not to have weird expectations. This being said Belarus is a little behind on tourism. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:30:11
That is how much he still has.
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:58:29
You are really retarded. First of all newbie? you have a few weeks, I am using this account for privacy, needed for a few more days. I've been around for years, and I am not defending Changelly. It's the first time I have heard about it, I couldn't give a flying fuck about them. I was curios and (if you will) pointing the OP's approach over Russia. Ohh.I see OP, has changed his approach over Russia and edited his post. Still, my reply doesn't defend Changelly at all...you are just slow to process.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:47:28
yes, it's ltc I belive
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:58:10
If you don't see any difference between these 2 time periods, than crypto is really not the place for you.
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:33:11
Agreed. After a few burns, you start to filter fud from facts.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:15:51
Were you looking around hoping to find some weirdness? I have some bad news, you have to look still.
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:04:17
not cracking, just preparing for that day, duh!!
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:39:23
dude, shut the fuck up, I am shitting my pans I won't get the chance to dump that shit. beecash is the king BEE CASH BEE CASH
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:43:09
What you think and what's real are 2 separate things. And thank you, but no luck involved here.
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:17:24
What is faster than pressing send? Do I really need to watch a 12ve minutes video?
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:16:17
I think I know a bit more than you about re/psyc. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:28:29
great, we have established now, you are a really really sad clown. Now, GTFO, with your half assed FUD attempt.

paxful is nothing but a joke. The owners scammed the users out of the bch fork, promised them the money in btc, and then delayed until the matter was forgotten.
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:15:16
Paxful is a scam site. The owners scammed all the users, promising to pay the bch fork in btc, sold the bch, then never credited anything to their customers. The owners are scammers
@_date: 2018-04-04 04:08:33
I liked it
@_date: 2018-04-19 22:45:55
What proof? They announced that. The said they sold and the users will be credited with 1:10 ratio, but that they have a problem with BitGo wallets. When BitGo wallets was inquired, they said they resolved the problem 2 weeks ago. That happened in Feb. If you follow the paxful forum, you will see, people are looking for a class action law suit.
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:36:48
who the fuk are you, though?
