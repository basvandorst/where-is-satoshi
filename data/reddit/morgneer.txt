A wallet can have many addresses, so I could be making a transaction with you and have 8 other addresses that you would know belong to me, while I could have much more than you can tell, all that's visible to you is the amount in the address you know of.

That would make 1 whole bitcoin be $100,000,000 at the current amount in the network, that would meant that bitcoin as a whole would have a $1,251,420,000,000,000 market cap, which is about 993x the amount of U.S. dollars currently in circulation

There is a reason exchanges don't accept credit card or PayPal because of chargebacks. But go to bitcoin-OTC, it's an irc channel that connects buyers to sellers

They seem waaayyyy too sketch. When I first saw butterfly labs ASIC ads I thought they looked sketch but looking further in to their company I found that they were legit.
Sadly, however I am starting think that people were right and that they will never ship

As for fliers, the bitcoin magazine put an easy to understand beginners guide in their magazine that I've used to explain bitcoins and bitcoin mining to other people, then my friend who is also Ito bitcoin said that we should put it up at our school, so we made copies and put them all around

They would be jealous of the profits early adopters are gaining not the fact that they can't get any, but the fact that so many are profiting soley because they heard about it first

There are transaction fees from the bitcoin network that go to miners. Bitcoin -qt (default client) has it set at .005 for transactions under 5btc I believe, while multibit allows you to set it anywhere from .001 and up, and electrum allows you to set whatever you want but gives you a suggested size for the amount of the transaction
@_date: 2012-12-11 00:08:28
@_date: 2012-12-11 00:11:08
Yes, I believe on the main site they advertise armory and multibit as alternatives. Also downloading bootstrap.dat will speed up the process as you are not using the p2p network

The beginners guide in the bitcoin magazine is a great way to introduce people to bitcoin in an easy way, if I have time I will scan it and upload it

Well bitcoins are meant to be used as a currency not as a way to get rich, so your using them as you should

Indeed,it helps explain to people that I don't just have a magical fairy in my computer that uses pixie dust to create money
@_date: 2012-12-11 07:24:18
Well, eventually miners won't mine for bitcoins as the amount per bock will be s small, but instead transaction fees would go to the miners for supporting the network

It's because people fear that which they don't understand
Also, people are generally skeptical about foreign concepts. non-tangible money is very foreign to some people, and they therefor reject it. Also people are quick to say bitcoin is insecure simply because of the amount of attacks on exchanges and such, but there are equally if not more attacks on businesses running on USD just that because bitcoin is new and strange to some people they will try to find excuses to label it as a scam. Also some people are wary of the volatile market and how one day it could be 15$ a btc and the next day 10$ per. This brings me to a separate point that people tend to only value bitcoins in their worth to usd when the true value of bitcoin isn't it's worth compared to other world currencies but the problems it solves in how we handle our money. Generally, because it is only digital people tend to put it on the same level as video game money or other meaningless digital points, I am often asked how I "won" my coins. Also people are detered because it is not backed by the government, but really that's some of the beauty of bitcoin, that it's decentralizedOverall the non-tangible part is the thing that deters the most people
Tl;dr analyzing various reasons why people don't like bitcoins 
most common reason  = non-tangible

Only if it is the speed that's broken, if it's just set to a different time but same speed, then it is never right

Yes both electrum and multibit have osx clients
@_date: 2012-12-13 07:04:15
Are you guys workin on anything for us OSX users?

I'm not too offended, I too am a young male. But I think that of we are going to let people know that bitcoin is a viable option for everyone, then we can't go claiming that it's only for certain people. If we are treating bitcoin as a currency that this isn't something that is true, it's like saying that dollars are for young males
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:56:10
I honestly have given up faith in them, they even invited 2 people from bitcoin talk to come and look at their products, they documented what they saw. So their stuff exists, but basically we are paying them to mine bitcoins for themselves

I bought 25 BTC at 10$ each last year, I too am in the long haul and am not worried about the price drops
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:46:05
It seems that bit stamp and mtgox are both at 170$ but btce is still behind at 116$
Edit: I had some old data, they are all together now at about 170$

Bitcoin is easier and cheaper to transfer than other methods
The dollar cannot be decided into 100,000,000 smaller units
The dollar is printed by a central controlling government, there is not a fixed amount
@_date: 2013-03-09 18:23:12
This is a terrible idea, while it might pay off, the volatility of the market makes this a very risky decision, never invest ALL your money in ANYTHING

What I do, is I place the wallet.dat on an encrypted drive with a complicated password of personal things in a mix of upper and Lower case prompted by things like,"your first dogs name in all capitals + moms middle name all lower case", there are about ten such prompts in a text file that I place in an encrypted drive alongside the first drive, except this one is encrypted with my regular password. I then take this new drive and I place it on 3 usbs and delete it on my computer

By far the easiest way to buy bitcoins that I have found, is bitcoin-OTC. It took me a while to understand how it all worked, but instead of dealing with big exchanges, you are dealing with individuals looking to sell
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:31:26
Is it normal for exchanges to have this big of a price difference. Mtgox appears to be at 130$. BTC-e appears to be at 120$ and bitstamp appears to be at 220$
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:57:42
Same here, been in since 2011, I was questioning my decision when it went from the 8$ that I bought at to 4$
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:25:06
No one has, at the end of each quarter it's "has been delayed for 1 or 2 quarters" then at the end of that timeframe they delay it even more
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:24:26
Not necessarily a good estimate, I've probably downloaded the client 9 times
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:46:26
*young, male, and tech-savvy*
Really? We are going to now start claiming that only young males use bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-03-28 08:29:18
Yes, you run a command to create a buy order, then someone contacts you looking to sell

Considering that post was made 3 days ago, bitcoin was well in the news at that time, it would have been rising. If they didn't know about it then at its peak of publicity, I doubt they will know about it for a long time. But, when they do learn the potential of bitcoin, they will be hitting themselves in the head for not thinking of it sooner
