In my mind one of the arguments for Bitcoin being 'the one' currency for the digital age is it effectively got there first. Its network is far bigger etc.
If however a big player like an Amazon or a country like the US decided I like this cryptocurrency thing and created its own what is to stop a company like 21-inc or even all the current Bitcoin miners saying I like this pony and re-purposing all that hardware to support the new DollarBit or Bitzon?  
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:48:40

Agree on a meetup date for the world. On that day turn up to chat Bitcoin but you'll also hold the Bitcoin sweepstake. Fling say 0.004 of a coin ($1ish) into the global hat (on-line wallet). After closing time that day everyone gets a percentage back that is randomly generated. So you could put in 0.04 bitcoin but get 1 bitcoin back, or 100 or just 1 bit!

Whilst I agree with your sentiments, well made points and  style I differ in not wanting to create NeoVictorian societies where those with genuine need have to rely on the charity of the few rich people who actually care.

Bitcoin is turning energy 'directly' into currency (and a network). Scaled up is is nowhere near the legacy system. Not even close. If you think bitcoin hashing energy usage has a linear relationship to scale you are also incorrect. 
If you think that the nightmarishly cut-throat mining industry will 'not' have to tap into renewables and use waste heat just to maintain parity with competitors you also need to do some more research.

All the sell the 2X coin shout need to be a little more nuanced. 2X dicks have deep pockets. They might get very much deep pockets by sell BTC before the fork then buying 2X as you instant dump the price low. Then they will shovel cash reserves in buying up the price of 2X as everyone panic buys back in.
Insta-dump 10-20% maybe. Then...
Make them pay for pumps! Make them bleed! Sell into tops of a pump a little at a time, keep reserves for a long drawn out week/s of fighting. IMO.

I also think WU's latest tweet saying BCH is not (never will be) BTC is actually a way of him trying to placate the Bitcoin community. So most likely he will mine BTC and BCH (with his boost) after 2X fails.

A friend visited this weekend. They work high up in a well known charity. We were talking bitcoin and they were interested, especially as this person said the charity marketing/outreach is complaining they are always late to new technology. This person could see that bitcoin or at least some form of crypto is going to be the future.
My question is if this organisation wanted to reach out to someone in confidence about bitcoin who would be best to approach? I assume they would be most interested in changing donations into currency that is immediately of use in research. The security of funds etc.. 
I was thinking a good match might be one of the big wallets, exchanges etc...? Co-promotion?

Safest answer to protect your investment is hodl both and for quite a while till you know the air raid sirens have stopped days/likely weeks.
To support a decentralised BTC that does not weaken the amazing resistance to government/company level 'persuasion' I would say hodl the initial line and sell intelligently. 
Hodl X2 through the initial dumps. The corp deep pockets will scoop up the cheap easily thrown fruit. Make them pay good money (good BTC) for the alt X2. Keep bleeding them. Save reserves, make the attack they are attempting hurt!

I think like many people I'm interested in Bitcoin for a whole host of reasons. A foot in a new ecosystem is enough for me. Its potential is interesting for me in many ways. These young educated technophiles are human and hopefully desire art for many of the same reasons we all do. I'm in it for the long term like many people here so maybe they might be future art patrons. I don't see why not?
I obviously sell most of my work face to face. That said I think certain art sells well online (editions of works in print format for example). This sort of work is going to sell for well under 1 BTC in most cases.  You could buy a limited edition signed etching by a really famous artist like David Hockey for less than 2 BTC!

Bitcoin is such a precious thing. It has a great lead and is in a unique position in history to create a different path for humans. NYA actors subvert this. Erode decentralisation and ultimately erode or destroy the lead we have in the chaos.
Erik you 'are' damaging Bitcoin. The hodlers of bitcoin will not recommend friends and family to your services.

The price... seems no-one really understands it. For example it just did a standing leap and shed 4/5%. Is it possible to look at the blockchain and say oh that happened because of that sale/buy/transfer? I hear that news also has an interesting negative function...

I recently watched Andreas M. Antonopoulos address Senate of Canada about Bitcoin 
I think the committee members seemed to think the same as I did, that he was crystal clear, genuine and insightful in his testimony. My question is, surely governments can see the strength in his arguments that this is early technology similar to the early internet. Why are more governments not tripping over themselves to get a slice of the early action?
@_date: 2015-04-20 12:37:18
Ok, fair point. 
As an artist who is optimistic about bitcoin I am 'tempted' to see early bitcoin adopters (which in my mind is everyone who has any bitcoin in the early 21st century) as potential collectors. r/bitcoin could be awash with potential millionaires with a nice wall or two spare... Artists tend to be supported by just a few patrons who like that artists work.

Should we be worried about a Clinton victory? This is given her camps statement on bitcoin and the waft of libertarian stink they think it has on it. Also I know the US vote is soon but when does a new president take the reins of power and start trying to make changes?
I know many in crypto investment land seem to want a Trump victory. I'm personally with Nadya from Pussy Riot When asked What is your opinion of Hillary Clinton?
Nadya - I wish America to have the first female president. I do not wish America to have selfish misogynist orange pig as a president. But maybe it would be better for bitcoin...

Still think a lottery/gambling ticket is a great way to go. Example business. Every ticket is a paper wallet. You pay $10/20 for one and every wallet has a guaranteed 0.04 Bitcoin in with 1/XXX chance of it being 1 bitcoin or jackpot of XX bitcoins. Recipient can choose to spend or horde them which would make these lottery tickets very unique (I can't think of anything gambling product that is similar?).

I like his thoughts about thinking of the long term returns.
Might be more profitable to Have a series of miners that would turn on at different energy points and forget a big battery bank or run only when the sunshines or/and stick a wind turbine into the mix. This would make it cheaper in up front cost and save the headache of working into the mix dying batteries. Mining at night happens if its windy. Very light mining when its overcast to full mining when its blazing outside.

I saw a thread asking why the full nodes are decreasing. When you mine is that the same as a full node? 
What are the odds of getting a block by mining is it better or worse than a lottery ticket? In the UK a lottery ticket is £2 and chances of winning are 1 in 14 million. 
I'm musing if someone who decided not to buy a ticket each month but put that money into a cheap USB asci would be better than the lottery odds or worse?

I decided to put of artistic thought into the Bitcoin standard coin logo. In my take I imagined the Bitcoin network as a coral. Corals rely on the resources of the colony, they are not one animal but a collective. They can colonize remote parts of the ocean, reclaiming ship wrecks and detritus. Where corals flourish complex ecosystems develop supporting some of the most unique and varied life on our planet. Whilst they are robust the reefs they form can be destroyed by the careless or wilful actions of humans. Respect and nurture the network! 
The B is made up from three different corals that connect the two nodes of the standard Bitcoin B. The three corals connect all six of these nodes (ends of the B).

The key point is security. The stakes are so high when you have taxes and voting etc. You cannot invent your own crypto test it for a year and launch. Not when bitcoin has been testing for 8 years. My bet is they will use a sidechain/coloured-coin etc that uses the bitcoin blockchain to verify.
