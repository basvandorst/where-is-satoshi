I mean if nothing changes I will be rooting for bitcoin to fail too. This digital gold narrative is stupid. 
But I hope bitcoin core gets their fucking act together and implements a solution. But until then i'm glad I pulled out my investment from bitcoin. The politics made me uneasy and the fees made me leave.

Honestly get a book. Actually get a couple of them and compare them. Best intro book is probably "the art and science of technical analysis". Most of the internet shit I wouldnt trust. Anyone can write and claim they were something on the internet. With a book its a little more difficult to produce a book... 
I dont use TA go trade but I use it mainly to find decent entry points into a crypto I want to buy and hold for a while. I compare the crypto to others within its "sector" so sort of fundamental analysis first and then after that I use TA to enter. The art and science book will help with that. It goes into more a little depth about the quant side and provides references which then you can pick up those if you want to dig deeper into the statistical edge TA can give you.

The tech behind bitcoin is basically stupid. The decentralization is good and powerful but proof of work is a ridiculously inefficient method. The tangle or proof of stake or proof of space are all more efficent methods. Using proof of work is stupid and she be destroyed. we are moving towards a period in history were energy is gettinf scare and we decide to put alot of it towards proof of work? God damn we're stupid as fuck.

Well i hope it does. But not until the space gets evolved enough. 
Well let me correct that. I hope bitcoin dies IF nothing changes and the fees remain stupidly high. If the fees get reduced like i hope for then I dont mind at all.

While I agree all of these are wonderful good features and drive a higher price level and make a good store of value for bitcoin (as well as crypto in general). What's to stop the US government from flat out banned cryptos just like they did with liberty dollars? 
If the US banned them other governments would likely follow suit. If the government bans companies from accepting them as payment they then go from being a actual payment method to a peer to peer payment method. While that still has some inherent value thats far less valuable than the ability to purchase physical products.

I wonder if bitcoin and other digital currencies are actually worth this much or if we are just in an insane half a year bubble? 
I think the answer is the technology is worth more than gold or traditional currencies because the processing speed is ~10 minutes or less. But maybe not as much as its currently valued.

Well it kind of deserves to die for not keeping up with the times. Decentralization is important. But utility is wayyyyyyy more important to your average consumer. In the end, utility wins over ideology every time.

I'm not arguing with you about that. But the argument that has arisen which is "its like digital gold so it should have stupidly high transaction fees" is stupid. And very clearly not his intention. 
Just because he's comparing it to gold doesn't mean shit. And the comment in regards gold is relating to miners and deflation its not difficult to see the comparison there. 
But sort of hard to argue with the literal title of the paper. "Peer to peer electronic digital cash system". News flash: Cash has very little if any transaction costs. 
Edit: took me a little bit to find Nakamoto's comments on the fees issue. But it's literally nonsense propagated by people from this sub who want smaller blocks (whether right or wrong). I'm fine with smaller blocks but I am not fine with huge fucking fees. Source Bitcointalk. But also these posts were quoted over in the sister sub; Feel free to read into it as you please. 
Satoshi talking about almost all transactions being free.(post [488](
"Almost all transactions are free. A transaction is over the maximum size limit if it has to add up more than 500 of the largest payments you've received to make up the amount. A transaction over the size limit can still be sent if a small fee is added.
The average transaction, and anything up to 500 times bigger than average, is free.
It's only when you're sending a really huge transaction that the transaction fee ever comes into play, and even then it only works out to something like 0.002% of the amount. It's not money sucked out of the system, it just goes to other nodes. If you're sad about paying the fee, you could always turn the tables and run a node yourself and maybe someday rake in a 0.44 fee yourself."
Satoshi talking about only "big transactions" paying a "small transaction fee". (post [492](
"There's a small transaction fee for very large transactions. The node that generates the block that contains the transaction gets the fee.
If the same money gets sent again, it won't incur the fee again. If all you have is generated coins in your wallet, if you send them all in one huge transaction, it has to bundle hundreds of 50 bc coins together. After that it's just one line to send the combined unit."

Youre not even mentioning the fact that the creator owns a huge amount of bitcoin about 5% or more of the total amount. All someone has to do is gain access to that and sell it all. 
And its not even hacking or government banning it. It could be triggered by some other event in the world. Its folly to think that nothing can stop it.

Yeah there's possible centralization in any market. Perhaps less with crypto than traditional markets. Even the creator owns less than like 2% or something of all bitcoin. That's not to say other whales dont own more. But thats a problem with every market not just bitcoin. For me the major draw in bitcoin is the Decentralized trust aspect and knowing banks (or the system) can't just inflate or deflate the value due to "economic conditions".

Yeah well Nakamoto said the solution to the fee problem is to not care how big the blocks get. I personally am in favor of smaller block sizes because I dont like centralization but its slowly been happening even with the small block. 
As long as BTC keeps the original bitcoin name I don't mind. BCH seems to be a failure and gets manipulated by miners often. Just look at the confirmation times... Its pretty insane.

Everything in the market has value because people say it has value. Why does a paper dollar have value?

Errrrrrrr except if the government bans apples completely from growing, selling, or being useful in any real way the purpose of apples is defeated. Just like with bitcoin its a store of value. But if bitcoin is banned as a currency, from owning it or keeping it or using it as a currency its value and thus store of value will be destroyed. I guess we could all move to a country that does support it. But if bitcoin gets banned in America that sort of fucks us with most desirable places. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:04:59
The difference this time around is people are more informed about the space. And until we get a ton of new and stupid investors bitcoin likely isn't going to sky rocket. Bitcoin is fundamentally not as strong as even litecoin. As a investor, I don't understand why I would ever want to invest in bitcoin. It can't even upgrade its fucking protocol. Which honestly makes me sad AF because bitcoin got me into this and I no longer believe in it. :/

God there's so much miss information out there. This is COMPLETELY THE WRONG IDEA!!!! 
Do people not know math? If your bitcoin core drops by 500 dollars but your bitcoin gold is only worth 400 then you have lost money. And from the way the market is looking, it seems like core is going to drop and gold will not be worth enough to offset the drop in core.

The futures are trading between 200-400 USD. So that's a decent amount of money. Perhaps not for a developer in the crypto space but for most that's hella good money for their time. Of course it depends on how long it takes them.

Well considering most large exchanges aren't even listing gold its sort of dead in the water out of the gate. It really just made core go on a bull run ��
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:23:51
No not really.... The high was 6200ish due to people wanting free money. Most exchanges aren't listing bitcoin gold and even if they were its only trading for about 500 or less. And since the high bitcoin has dropped more than 500. So you have lost money. Of course these are all only paper gains/losses unless you sold them. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:31:02

Frankly it's a big deal to hardcore anti centralizationists. Which is basically what bitcoin is about. It comes as no surprise to me that this is a huge deal to lots of the Reddit community as I bet some or most of these redditors were around for a long time. 
Seeing the history of forking from bitcoin it hasnt been good for the forks. However that may change because, at the time of writing this, 83% of miners support 2x.

Litecoin and ETH I bought when it was super low. Xrp has had a boom recently due to adding the 100th company. Sadly my neo, xmr, dash, and zcash are.

I wasn't talking about long term price movements I was talking about past price movements. And its true. Short term you will have lost money if bitcoin falls more than the current value of btg. Long term price movements are impacted by fundamentals and economic conditions. Short term shit is dictated by fear, greed, and hype.

Currently living at home and most of my expenses are paid for. Its a risk I can take on without fucking myself. Lol

There will probably be a big crash after the fork. There was last time and history repeats itself.

Don't be stupid. Bitcoin gold is trading futures at about 200-400 right now. About the same as cash has been.

The thing is this meme isn't even implying they are shitcoins or trash... It'd saying bitcoin is taking off. 
Anyone who says other coins are shit is stupid. At this point most coins have better tech than bitcoin, but that doesnt mean bitcoin is bad just means network effects are very strong. 
The reason for the rise, at least currently, is the move from altcoins into btc for the free money in gold. There will probably be a pretty significant pullback in November right after the release.

While I can see why you think that. You really believe that there aren't better coins out there that do things better, faster, and sooner than bitcoin does? 
I think crypto in general is a highly valued asset. But to say bitcoin should be higher is sort of insane. 
Bitcoin is neither private/anonymous, has higher confirmation times than lots of coins, updates are slower, the hash method has allowed acis and increased centralization. 
Just even at a basic level litecoin is better. But in my opinion xmr is better. Has more development the any other coin except bitcoin. Its actually anonymous. Has more transactions per block. GPU miners. Faster confirmation times too. 
The two reason I think bitcoin will go higher is because of network effects and generally uneducated investors entering the market place. This bull run is due to the up coming fork and everyone wanting free money even though gold is a scam.  
I think, if ever, the investors get a sense of bitcoin they'll realize its not as amazing as they once thought.

It was an example lol. Its ignorant to say that bitcoin will always be the dominator in the space.

This shit was back in 2010  its unlikely anyone would have held onto those until now. They likely would have sold most when it reached 500 in the first boom. Its just igornant to say its worth 29 million. He needed to hold them all till now.

I don't really trade them closely so I don't notice a ton but ETH, litecoin, and btc all seem pretty correlated. At least they were before this last boom. Sometimes I had trouble telling which graph I was actually on between the three. 
Now they don't seem to be as correlated.

But does that mean that bitcoin will even be around still... will it be a good place to store value... will it be a good currency for consumers to purchase big goods with? Who knows. Most emails are dead and gone but only a few have survived. 
I think email will stay around or blockchain will stay around. But saying BITCOIN will stay around is very much up for debate. Let alone reach a price of 400,000 dollars.

Yeah there's possible centralization in any market. Perhaps less with crypto than traditional markets. Even the creator owns less than like 2% or something of all bitcoin. That's not to say other whales dont own more. But thats a problem with every market not just bitcoin. For me the major draw in bitcoin is the Decentralized trust aspect and knowing banks (or the system) can't just inflate or deflate the value due to "economic conditions". 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:18:22
Wtf has this sub turned into... 400,000 is outrageous when large potion of the world population don't have access to the internet. You can get into bitcoin without the internet but lets be honest. What fsrmer in India is going to trust something based on tech he hasn't even really dealt with. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:29:29
Fees purchasing or selling bitcoin + the miners fees for purchasing or selling or transfer coins. But hey at least its less and at least theres no wallet or bank fee.... For now. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:41:34
So should I dump my 600 dollar paycheck Into bitcoin right now? I get it tomorrow ��
I sort of dont like buying at all time highs. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:03:43
I mean before cash it crashed due to... China I think. Fuck feels like forever ago ��
But yeah the alts didn't recover nearly as big as I thought they would after gold forked. Nor did bitcoin correct as much as I thought it would. 
Hell there's another fork happening in december. Lol. I think btc or 2x or whatever is the bitcoin then will be going higher until this fork nonsense stops.

Most people aren't traders for numerous reasons (day jobs, its scary/can't deal with the stress, would destroy their capital, can't come up with a system, ect) but its easy to continue pushing a narrative which is holding. Holding is basically taking liquidity off the market and making it harder for people to sell. This drives up the price which in turn benefits bag holders, mostly. Its a self reinforcing prophecy, until it doesn't work. Which is precisely when you should be buying and holding is when people are panicking and selling..... That is with GOOD INVESTMENTS. and in my opinion bitcoin is likely a good investment... Still really speculative and at risk of being dethroned (bitcoin gold and other altcoins) but bitcoin should represent a small portion of your investments. 
I am young so bitcoin and alts represent about half of mine and growing. Cuz I can lose everything I have in bitcoin and its literally pocket change in terms of my long term earnings. 
Sorry sort of rambled...

As much as I hope this is true I live in reality lmao. This is not going to happen. At most we'll get currencies ran by government and everyone will go there because its "ran by the government so it must be better"

I think you're overestimating the amount of people who know anything about bitcoin. Just yesterday in my econ class at a somewhat affluent college it came up through me and another student who share similar interests in crptyo. The majority of the class 
all thought it was insanely risky and thought the actual system could collapse at any moment. 
And its not like most econ students dont keep up on the news, most do, and we have access to more than most people in the world. It will probably be a very long time before crpyto becomes a widely accepted alternative to normal banking.
