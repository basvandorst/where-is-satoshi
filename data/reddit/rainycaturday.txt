Not seeing an update on GooglePlay. Still on version 2.3.1
Also, I wish the app would timeout your pin entry (dunno if I am saying this right).. Had the app open and went back to it a day later and was still past the initial pin request.

Wow! Thanks for the bits! They will definitely go towards getting my friends interested in Bitcoin!
I'll make sure to check out Dark Wallet so I can offer more options to them (currently recommending Mycelium).

Thanks for this explanation and your thoughts!

So this gives me the opportunity to clear up something I was wondering about.
Is it possible for a company like Circle, lets call it Octagon, to move their servers to a country with no regulations but still do business with Americans? I mean.. really my bitcoins don't exist in any one country so they shouldn't be bound by any one countries regulations.
Would I have to use something to mask my IP or would they just not have to care about my location anymore?
Also, when can we expect a decentralized automated wallet + mixing service that keeps my coins in my control that is purely autonomous (not run by people)?

I don't understand why Coinbase and I assume Circle is so popular with bitcoiners(?). It's centralized and supported by banks right?
I don't get what it offers, that would make someone want to use it instead of holding onto their money themselves. Can someone explain?

Ahh thanks didn't see that. Just sideloaded it, that login thing is pretty slick!
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:56:25
I'd say I like your style OP but to be honest it's a bit 'Meh'.

Here here, good jorbs all around!
Glad to see people promoting Bitcoin!

Why are everyones answers so convoluted?
Uhm.. Send a secure encrypted email with the private key to an account with however much bitcoin you want to send?
Unless I'm wrong, totally possible.

You need to train the wolves to not eat the sheep.
You will reach a lot more of the public by getting governments and other big companies approval and use of bitcoin than you would by trying to reach out and teach them individually.
They have the attention and trust of their customers and if they embrace bitcoin, so will their customers. Rather than some internet people trying to convince them that the companies they already have been using for years are wrong when they say bitcoin is bad.

I dunno.. yea I agree it is still in a volatile point but it seems to be starting to stabilize for the longest period so far.. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 03:37:07
Holy shit, this guy.
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:53:12
That was fun.
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:35:30
Probably because blockchains don't work without an incentive like the bitcoin rewards and the value that makes them a valid incentive.. Unless you run centralized blockchains with nodes held by one or few entities.. The opposite of the whole idea.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:24:07
Sure, will do. Although I think we all use Android.
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:34:01
Shhhh... Don't say that.. Do you want to attract the attention of our Google overlords?!
@_date: 2015-06-11 12:37:38
Hey thanks, glad someone else got a laugh out of it ;)

Have your higher ups said anything about it?
I mean it's pretty much advertising what will be their undoing isn't it?

I'd also enjoy a ELI5 why we are certain we need blocks larger than 1 MB.
Is it because a large influx of transactions causes validation to take more than 10mins, opening some vulnerability I assume?

So I've just been researching/learning about Bitcoin and have seen a lot of Andreas' talks on youtube.
His information seemed very useful and knowledgeable, but now I'm seeing that reddit doesn't like him?  Regardless of his statements, is his technical info and talks worth putting value in? I learned a great deal.
Also, so if I get this right, we aren't trusting either party in this whole OkCoin/Cpz thing?

What are they gonna do when we have the 'keys' to our unbreakable encryption in our head. Torture? I mean.. at some point they have to accept that there is nothing they can do to stop personal encryption.
