like encrypting your key you can encrypt your "old-states". in fact, this is most commonly done in LN wallets, often using fingerprint / passphrase to decrypt.

@_date: 2019-07-16 20:57:43
never forget that technology is still in development. risk scenarios like yours can be critically valued in future development, and can for example lead to prevention strategies (shower thought: a 1MB or other fixed value base layer blocksize limit, but LN emergency / penalty transactions can always be included regardless of blocksize / don't fall under the normal base layer restrictions). 
There are many possibilities in future development. Keep up your good and critical work, as this can be used to further strengthen a developing system!
another point: if you fear that penalty transactions will be abused: eltoo is a LN technology, that can simply overwrite with latest state, instead of penalty txs.
@_date: 2019-07-17 09:23:33
don't forget that LN is still in early stages. There have been times where hardware wallets weren't available for normal crypto. as development continues, it will be possible to keep LN keys and states offline, too....

@_date: 2017-12-28 16:02:44


this is bullshit. it would require &gt;50% miners to agree on that. if &gt;50% miners agree on somewhat new rule, then it's a takeover. Exactly the same could happen when &gt;50% miners agree that there are more than 21m bitcoin. It's possible, but would instantly get rejected.
By the way, &gt;50% miners could also agree that legacy coins get worthless. Doesn't make sense, but they could.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:46:30
^ this sums it up. The BTC vs BCH thing is DONE as soon as LN is working properly. Main goals right now should be
a) increase segwit adoption
b) accelerate LN development
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:27:50
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:01:28
actually you see two effects: one immediately (-30% on fee), and a passive effect of lower fees if segwit is massively used on chain
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:59:24
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:55:42
using 2 layers, when channel gets empty, you have to use an on-chain transaction to rebalance your channel, which costs fees and takes ~10 mins until confirmation. using 3 layer makes refunding your channel instant and zero cost.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:44:25


@_date: 2017-12-17 00:50:33

just out of interest... were they segwit paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:14:55
no one said that 51% attack is _not possible_
but rule changes using 51% attack are not limited to segwit transactions, they could rewrite EVERY BTC consensus rule.
Signatures haven't been removed, but have been relocated and are still mandatory to proove ownership. try publishing a segwit transaction without witness, you will see that it is impossible. By the way, the intention was not to save space, but to fix malleability security hole. I am pretty sure that this change doesn't affect any of your "legal advisor's" concerns. 
Please don't create arguments out of nothing  and stop spreading FUD. As you can see, bitcoin works like it worked before (but with a slight capacity increase), tons of money is safely secured using segwit addresses. If you don't like the concept because of some personal aversion, then don't use it. Segwit is not mandatory, old-style addresses can be continued to be used even though there aren't any good arguments for legacy usage anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:57:18
this amount will soon be able to be trasfered fee-less to my lightning channel ... at least i hope so :)

definitely. just wanted to add some clearity :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:08:11
actually is enough, but can be further optimized using layer-3 solution. right now, we should better focus setting up LN as fast as possible. when it is running smoothly, we can proceed further, ...

@_date: 2017-12-27 17:03:49
wrong.... segwit tx use space BOTH in block and in witness appendix
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:45:44
added benefit of layers that allow flexible instant moving, rebalancing, and refunding of channels. not mandatory from the beginning, but gives an idea about some awesome solutions that could be added later when LN is running.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:46:46
i was assuming the tipbot will withdraw solely using LN, and will transfers its funds into a payment channel when LN is ready (of course that would require a one-time on-chain transaction for the tipping service, a single tx which moves all funds of all users into LN once, so you are correct :) )
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:47:02
define "normal" fees. In a direct LN channel it is feeless. Routed transaction: It will be possible for LN nodes to set a fee. But routing algo always chooses cheapest. And it's easy for everybody to setup a node, so big fee competition = low fees, like 1-2sats
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:35:40
i thought it gets deleted from mempool after 3 days?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:50:59
i am doing the same to be honest.... but moving back to good old BTC asap when technologies are ready!
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:53:00
Yeah, it's expensive, but would've been more expensive using legacy format (e.g. $40 instead of $30, segwit saves about 30% space in blocks)
google transaction "vsize"
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:18:34
i hope you are right so badly!
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:42:19

I've got a technical question to ya guys: Let's say we have a lightning transaction from A to B routing over hub H
before transaction it is:
A(1btc) &lt;--&gt; (1btc) H (1btc) &lt;--&gt; (1btc) B
after transaction it is:
A(0.5btc) &lt;--&gt; (1.5btc) H (0.5btc) &lt;--&gt; (1.5btc) B
Is there a way for Hub H to rebalance the channels WITHOUT an on-chain transaction?
A(0.5btc) &lt;--&gt; (1btc) H (1btc) &lt;--&gt; (1.5btc) B
Or did i get something wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:45:58
no, segwit can't be abandoned at that point. Would require a hardfork, so it wouldn't be bitcoin anymore. Additionally, it doesnt make sense to abandon it, as all the upcoming technologies are built ontop of segwit, so segwit is required for them to work. Also keep in mind, that there are no negative aspects about segwit. It increases block space and security, fixes malleability and so on
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:29:03
one could think it's on purpose... but in the end... at least they support segwit. that's more than most other wallets do :o)

@_date: 2017-12-11 04:07:19
there is always someone on the other side. if not, price is higher for your long / lower for your short until you have a matching order. basically how an exchange works, just with futures
@_date: 2019-11-17 12:25:40
so if my LN channel gets depleted, i have to push an order for a contract on fees before i send an on-chain transaction to top-up the channel. Then i have to constantly check if tx went through and manage the fee-contract accordingly. No, i am pretty sure that's not how future of crypto will look like. Note that constantly adding complexity to the system will also add sources of error, unreliability, bad UX and so on. And all this just to try to fix a problem that shouldn't exist (full blocks, high fees). Remind me in two years, i am sure that this solution won't be ready or used by end-users for day to day tx .....
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:01:21
that's right. It's called first-mover advantage, which BTC is still profiting from. But this can change dramatically during 2-3 years.

people are lazy. they don't want to read manuals and instructions. They don't want to prepare off-chain funds for fork. And they definitely don't want to risk off-chain money during protocol upgrades. Masses don't search bitcoin forums for upcoming fork schedule.
I you think "hey, no problem. we can deal with this" i sadly have to add:  They don't want to calculate fees. They don't want to risk not being included into block for weeks and then get rejected. They don't want to overpay fees. They just want it to work; quick, reliable, cheap.
@_date: 2019-11-20 17:46:49


i thought babies are dying because we use BTC instead BCH ;)
@_date: 2019-11-20 17:44:23


no way. for a pig farmer, this makes obviously sense, no question. For a simple A --&gt; B transaction, this is way to complicated and fault-prone, even if software manages this. Contracts have maintenance fees, rolling fee, can get closed by provider, make me dependent on provider, and if i can't predict the date of my next transactions, contract has to stay open for a loooong time. If fees are constantly high (over weeks, like Dec 2017) this contract doesn't help me in any way. After a few on-chain transactions, my long contracts get depleted, as i close a contract for every transaction, and i have to use the spot tx fee, which is high. 
Your tx fee market doesn't solve the underlying problem (even less then LN does). It can only save you some tx fee in very circumscribed situations, and if you are willing to give away some freedom. And sure your tx fee market doesn't allow for independent cheap, near rate-unlimited on-chain transactions
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:17:04

@_date: 2019-08-12 20:31:53
instead a blocksize increase, one could cut blocktime &amp; reward half (5min blocks, 6.25btc block reward), thus inflation stays the same. Would this be a hardfork? Would older clients accept the blocks (as they are &lt;1mb).

@_date: 2019-08-12 19:36:20
i am talking about peg-out, that's right. Currently, i am dependent on the willingness of the federation (as it is a "federated sidechain") to swap my L-BTC for BTC. 
As soon as lightning atomic swap tools are available, i can swap my liquid-BTC (LBTC) for a loaded btc LN-channel. But in this case, just another user gets the LBTC, it is not "pegged out". For a real peg-out, authorization by members of the federation are always necessary.
You can compare LBTC to tether, where the tether holdings are administrated by 15 comporations (exchanges). Of course i can trade my tether with anyone, i can have as many tether addresses as i want, send it back and forth as many times i want to in my wallet. But as soon as i want my $ back from the issuer, i am dependent on the administrators (11-out-of-15 exchanges).
Please, correct me if i got that wrong.
@_date: 2019-08-12 10:06:30
core refused to hardfork over and over again. High transaction fees block crypto adoption day by day and currently leads to negative adoption in many cases. Even a reasonable slight blocksize increase, which could relax the situation &amp; pave the way until LN/Schnorr are ready, is declined. Even 50$ fees and crashing nodes because of mempool overflow in 2017 didn't change their mind. I'm highly sceptical we will see a hardfork in btc, even if necessary.

@_date: 2019-08-16 15:58:11
just like it will take time to put bitcoin in the right light again after L2 is finally working, explaining them that fees aren't high anymore
we should vote for blocksize increase as interim solution until all the other stuff is working (2mb is possible with today's hardware without significant centralization). if bitcoin doesn't deliver when it is needed (like 2017), critical phase of adoption is left out, and it will take many many years to catch up again.

sry, but 70cent fee is unacceptable. I do my day to day transactions for 0cent. Would be willing to pay a small amount for financial freedom, but 70c is way out of range. 
Devs should pull themselves together, stop blocking crypto development for their own purpose/ custodial products (liquid, ....), and find an interim solution, like increase blocksize to give the other techniques time (LN to evolve / schnorr to be developed, ....)
No way crypto will win this race with fees like that. If we don't pave the way now, cryptos will stuck being a 	niche product forever

that's what i hear since 2015. I believed in this for years. 
* the right moment to gain momentum and the opportunity / chance to widespread adoption is now. Maybe more precisely: Best moment was 2017. Btc was not delivering when it was used and needed most.
* we were happy with an 1mb limit in 2010, when it was implemented. Hardware efficiency and capability has increased a lot during those 9 years. I am sure, that a 2mb limit would be reasonable and possible without leading to drastic centralization, and is easily possible with todays hardware.
* In fact, the favored solutions like liquid sidechain are much more centralised than btc nodes would be after blocksize increase to 2mb.
* core has to finish hibernation, and organize some increase of btc throughput on baselayer as interim solution, until second layer is ready. Second layer solutations are not reliable and working for end users right now. Btc has to stay functional on baselayer
ps: longterm core supporter here. But things have to be said.
@_date: 2019-08-31 23:15:10




because adoption is dropping because no one can afford to use BTC right now


those are perfectly fine with SPV clients. In fact, also today, most apps don't download the full 200GB blockchain data, but focus on their own addresses (SPV or neutrino). There is no need for the whole UTXO set to be stored on the phone.


that's ok. Not everyone needs to run a full-node. There is no evidence to 100,000 nodes being critically more secure than 10,000 nodes.


if we are THAT afraid about blocksize, we could go step-by-step and rise to segwit1.1mb (2.4mb average) and repeat until we see critical bottlenecks. AT LEAST we would START scaling then, instead of doing nothing right now. U really think 2.4mb average would shut down the network?


yeah, if you want to stop the bitcoin project right now once and forever, switch to 270kb blocks. BTC impact and market share mostly gone by the next day then.


segwit2x (4.4mb average) blocksize should be okay for todays tech
You know what the problem with L2 / lightning is? Average Joe doesnt want to first get BTC, then pay high fees to lock their BTC up on LN, then keep their wallet online 24/7, backup channel states, maintain a well routed node, etc. If we depend on LN for further BTC scaling, this coin development is dead end.....

you got me wrong. You can hard fork with consensus to a dynamic blocksize, while staying completely decentralized.
I would prefer a blocksize increase WITH consensus (with core's will to upgrade, consensus would have been there 2015; but they blocked progress). 


as i said, i prefer blocksize increase WITH consensus (which we had in 2015). What core did instead was shoving down 1mb blocks down everybody's throats, and the inability or unwillingsness to upgrade. Or force segwit down everybody's throat. Who said majority wanted to stay with small blocks?


I'm not a bcash promoter, but can you explain how it "failed". Bch working fine since hard fork.


no need to start swearing in here. Community is deeply divided since 2015, with many small and big players having left Btc and core because of their inability to act. It's not that "people" all were against block size increase from day one, please read threads from 2015 to see how conflicting the topic was (and, it seems, is until today). The decision to go segwit1mb+LN, which still mainly can be considered experimental, and doesn't fully deliver until today, was a minority decision, ignoring large parts of the community.


already 2017 proven possible  and i don't propose GB-blocks, just increase to segwit1.5mb, go step by step from there. "impossible" is a big word for something that works flawlessly on many altcoins until today.


still they are a rarity on BTC. I would be perfectly fine to accept 0-conf tx as a restaurant if blocks were not constantly full, which would represent a reasonable security trade-off. I even would prefer 0-conf on Bch over 0-conf on Btc from security perspective and prefer bch 0-conf over LN, which has many limitations and risks itsself.


doesn't explain why they are very very rare, if it is so simple....... Simply broadcasting doesn't mean a successful double spent.


while this is technically true, honest nodes running core won't accept a replacement tx for non-RBF tx, and will obviously accept a replacement tx for RBF-tx (as it is part of its functionality). Technically, 0-conf replacement is still possible running other node software.
I didn't say 0-conf is never replaceable. But it offers a good security trade-off if blocks are not full (on Btc 2009-2015 and on Bch 2015 to today).


don't need to answer this. Let's stay with facts, not accusations.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:04:47
that's the easy answer..... 
segwit for example (softfork, different case, i know) is recognized as valid by old clients, because they assume older blocks as valid (they couldn't validate anyway because they don't request segregated signature data)
what about the difficulty of the PoW? Is it checked on older blocks?
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:30:17
can we please stay realistic and acknowledge that segwit1mb can't handle demand for on-chain transactions right now? Fees of .5$ are too damn high and prevent adoption day by day. LN not nearly ready, at least not for medium volume transactions around 5-10btc. Liquid is custodial. Next bull-run and fees will be 50$ again. Best time to care about scaling was 2017. As this failed, we should keep discussion alive and care about scaling NOW.
ps: long term core supporter here
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:03:37
ok then let's say 1btc transactions: no routes on LN for this. Opening direct channel cost more on-chain fees than a standard on-chain transaction. 50$ fee for a 10.000$ transaction is not competitive.
If at least there would be some good arguments to not increase to segwit2mb. Devs fear lower decentralization of nodes, but drive people into using highly centralized L2 solutions like liquid instead. If 1MB was concidered a reasonable limit in 2010, why is 2MB concidered too high in 2019, where hardware is a magnitude cheaper / faster / .... 2MB is possible today. Fulstop.
Every single day btc development stays like a deer in headlights, we lose more of the possibility to take over larger % of traditional financial markets by delivering a expensive slow unreliable product. Time to show a well functioning btc to people in NOW. I've already met so many during last year saying "well, it's too expensive, slow, unrealiable, unusable". Opinion is hard to change after it has formed. Sad to look back @ the last 2-3years. Devs have to wake up.

If blocks wouldn't be all full, a 0-conf non-rbf transaction would provide SOME degree of security, as inclusion into a block would be realistic. This degree of security is OK for many transactions, thus waiting up to few hours for the next block isn't necessary anymore. 
Personally, i would totally be ok accepting 1000$ 0-conf on bch, but not ok to accept 1000$ rbf 0-conf on btc. Only on btc i have to wait for the next block (maybe a few hours). 1000$ on lightning often causes routing problems and channel opening, so not competitive in terms of usability and fees.

@_date: 2019-08-28 16:14:39
Yeah, i do 1sat/byte, but because i am a nerd. But a large % of people wont do that. You will lose them by delivering an unreliable, slow, expensive product. And even for me as a tech-savvy user, BTC user experience is awful.
remeber Dec2017? So you are totally ok with
- nodes crashing because of mempool bloat
- tx being removed from mempool because they don't get included for 2 weeks
- tx inclusion into blocks gets totally unpredictable
Of course, there will always be a possibility to get your tx in somehow. Much more important, if we want people to use BTC is, that 50$ are not competitive &amp; totally unpredictable tx inclusion into blocks doesn't drive adotion. A working product shouldn't demand you doing tons of research about fees, constant checking for inclusion during the following days / weeks, perhaps rebroadcasting, replace-by-fee transactions etc.
I wouldn't be so drastic, if there were any good reasons not to increase to 2mb right now as an interim solutions. If we fear a lowing decentralization of nodes, we could start with 1.1mb blocksize and increase step by step. But what we do instead, is applying the same limit since 2010, wait and see the technology fail because of unnecessary limits, looking at negative adoption. ......

for people judging btc by end user experience, not GIT-proposals (when Schnorr?)




correct! 2010 is the correct year where 1mb block limit was introduced, not 2012. So we were fine with 1mb blocks in 2010, 1mb blocks were possible to broadcast in 2010 (and were perfectly fine for the network back then), but in 2019 we still refuse to upgrade to higher than 1.1mb average. There goes your scaling btc.




possible, but not used. In times of heavy blockchain load, often only 1.1mb can be produced due to blocksize limitations.


source please. Something, that works on many altcoins, can't be wrong on the much better powered btc network. Please show me proof, that btc would be doomed, if we increase blocks +20% for example. We can. Today. We would acutally scale then.... 




 "Outsourceable enforcement: if one party closes a channel in an old state in an attempt to steal money, the other party has to act within a defined period of time to block the attempted theft." If the other party doesn't act (or can't act due to full blocks ---&gt; money stolen)




i needed to pay sats in many lightining apps because of this, so NOT unfounded drama




please show a (today!) working solution without using expensive on-chain tx, always like to learn something new.




 "an attacker could pretend to open a new payments channel and send fake transactions. Being duped, an honest user could then send back real money to the attacker not knowing the previous transactions had been completely artificial." resulting in the lighting-btc of the victim not being backed by real btc. This is not obviously visible to the victim until a settlement tx is broadcasted to the blockchain. Then, at latest, you see that you were stolen money on LN, and you don't get any real btc from your ln-btc.


there is no "can't happen by definition" in software development. Like this LN bug has shown: everything can happen, it just was not INTENDED by definition.


no need to start swearing here. And no need to talk about bch in here, let's completely stick to btc discussion.


no, you can't. As blockchain doesn't equal to the latest channel state. I have to trust the LN software. And, in case of any bug, like the recent LN bug, i can lose real money on LN. No way to see this on blockchain until settlement transaction.




I just concidered a working blockchain safer than LN (because LN security is always dependent on underlying blockchain + just adds own risk to the system. no way it's the other way round).


i dont


as i don't own any Bch, i don't lose any value.

there's no evidence for this. Reward dropping to zero won't occur for a looooooong time. Still can softfork to a lower blocksize cap if needed then. What we do right now is killing adoption, usability, UX, and many other things because mining COULD decrease long in the future. Block rewards still be high in 8 years without fees, please do your research.

@_date: 2019-08-30 05:40:15


so the only alternative i have is paying 50$ in tx on-chain fee or use liquid centralized custodial solution (for me liquid is nearly equivalent to using a custodial exchange and transfer btc from user to user over there)


 
i was refering to segwit2mb. which should get up to 4.4mb. 
and look at blockexplorers, most blocks are cut way before that 2.2mb limit due to low segwit usage...


this is a blod claim. i'd say 8mb would NOT cause centralization. Today's hardware is ready for that! But if we still FEAR that it could cause centralization, we could still go step-by-step and set segwit2mb as new limit. I see centralization forming as "federated sidechains" much more critical (as people actually hand over their btc into the hands of the "federation" of 11 exchanges) as loosing some poor connected nodes on L1. 
I repeat once again:  If 1MB was concidered a reasonable limit in 2010, why is 2MB concidered too high in 2019, where hardware amplified multiple times during this interval. I just bought a 5GB HDD for 80$ a few days ago. In Dec 2017 that would equal 1.5 on-chain transactions' fee.


i really apprechiate the the throughput analysis for all the hard work that was put into it. however, it has some serious drawbacks, when it comes to real-world scenarios. Compare this comment: 
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:32:50
any substantial updates / milestones in this?
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:43:57


no need to swear. Let's stay with facts, not emotions.


i know. And if you look at the halving schedule, you see that there is plenty of time until we become "dependent on fees" as mining reward, i doubt we ever come to that point.


let's kill the project with high fees before we face any significant adoption is the better way? The point of "being dependent on tx fees for network security" will, if ever, be reached gradually. It's not "the ONE day" when an emergency fix needs to be thrown in. It can be seen, if we even come to that point, over many months, and an easy soft fork can be applied then. Still, i doubt that it is needed in the end.




again, no need to swear. If fees are really (as you say) required to secure the network, we will have easy consensus, then, no worries.

for example, tether or XRP supply is huge, but only the coins released to public are counted on CMC. Correspondingly in your example, not 1billion, but only 1 coin (which was publicy released) shound be counted and marcet cap equals 1$.

I am not associated with btc. If you dig deep enough in my account history, you will mostly find differing opinions to bch people, and heavy fights with egon01 ;) 
my arguments come from technical analysis, benchmarks, field studies, .... from my point of view, the bcash community doesn't play a big role in BTC consensus finding; nevertheless i am still happy that they constantly show that crypto is there to be USED and that blocksize increase IS safely possible even though they only have a limited hashrate, market share, power, .... compared to btc. 


example code doesn't help me as end user in any way. Real product updates help. all those points didn't change my end user experience in any way during the last 5 years. I recognize the effort, but problems didn't get solved yet / persist.


i am talking about segwit1.5x .... or 6000 block weight. Or in other words: +50% from current limits


that's exactly what i am talking about. There is no 100% uptime guarantee, nowhere. I want to be safe even during power outages etc. I dont want to pay a 3rd party watchtower, + hope &amp; trust they do their work correctly and dont face outages themselves. I want my money to be safe, indepented of 3rd party and uptime.
If i would take a guess and compare LN reality to your proposed "own basic security": I think most of current LN is NOT using watchtowers or is NOT online 24/7 (except custodial solutions which is against what bitcoin stands for: be your own bank). The lightning apps i used and that offer watchtower functionality additionally take fees.


they may be altruistic _at the moment_, but i still have to trust them to do their job when i am offline. Yeah.... trust..... I thought, with bitcoin, we build a trustless system.


There is no 100% uptime guarantee, nowhere. additionally, i don't want to have my keys on an 24/7 online node. But i have to.


i want zero fees for just keeping my money and not moving. And i dont like relying on a 3rd party, which is taking fees, in general.


i was not talking about routing hubs, but hubs with many open channels, a business for example. If a big (commercial) LN-node with, let's say &gt;1000 open channels, decides to mass-broadcast old channel-states to the blockchain to steal mass amount of money, there will not be enough space in the small blocks to put penalty tx in there in-time, as blocks are intended to be already full on normal load. People will be forced to pay extremely high fees to get their penalty tx on blockchain in-time (50$/tx like in Dec 2017), or will lose their money. As LN is designed to manage amounts of around 1-50$, this will eat up the whole reserve in any case.
Additionally, in most LN apps, i don't know how to set the penalty tx fee. It is either fixed rate (which is risky in the above mentioned scenario = penalty tx will not be confirmed in time), or other pre-defined solutions without user interaction possibility.


this becomes a problem as soon as tx fee will be 50$ again on next bubble. Opening channel (50$), rebalancing (50$), top-up (50$), closing channel (50$). This is not sustainable.


Thank you for agreeing on this. LN is forced hot wallet. It's a security trade off that wouldn't be necessary if on-chain scaling would have been on core's agenda during last years.


i didn't say that higher amounts are technically not possible. They are de-facto not possible right now, after years of development, as no hub will open bigger channels with me in real world scenario. I simply can't use it to buy a new 1000$ computer right now, not possible.


LN security will always be less than on-chain security. Why make things more complicated then they need to be. We don't need the security &amp; usability trade off with LN, as on-chain scaling is possible today.


yes. For serious amounts, just wait a corresponding higher number of blocks. If bcash would have the hashrate of Btc, and would be in btc's position, i would take large sums as confirmed after 2 blocks (like i do on Btc right now). Bch's double spend risk is more because of the lower hashrate. Double spends happend in BTC, too, and are always possible. On LN you take exactly this risk PLUS x. 
By the way: the LN bug was abused and people got hurt. The Bch double spend action was undertaken by a big miner to prevent segwit UTXOs being stolen by a single unknown entity, and UTXOs were given to their corresponding owners. No one was hurt. It was only necessary because of a (from my point of view very controversial) change in consensus of how segwit UTXOs are handled on Bch. You see a can criticize bcash, too ;)
To sum it up: On-chain i can just wait to have the desired number of confirmations until i am fine from security viewpoint. On LN, i do the same (LN channel open/top up/close/.... can be double spent / reversed, too), so same security implication PLUS i have to pray my watchtower does his job or my node stays online, my LN-btc is still backed / no further peg bug gets found, and my hot wallet keys don't get hacked, channel partners dont broadcast old channel states, and if they do, blocks hopefully have space for my panelty tx.


I dont "shill" bcash. I recommend no one to buy bch. If you ask me about specific coins, i would recommend holding some BTC as small chances are that they see the need to scal on-chain, and use an low-fee altcoin of your choice to transact for transactions of everyday life, like DOGE or any other.

@_date: 2019-10-04 18:31:54


 


i never said that 0sat/byte tx should be possible again (like it was 2009-2014). I am fine with a small fee (up to 0.01$), a 50$ tx fee like in dec 2017 will prevent btc adoption @ root.


I would be fine with a reasonable 0.01$ tx fee to prevent spam. If you still see it as too low:


as it is technically possible today, WHY NOT?! That's how btc works. And if demand for many transactions is there, YES, i demand that everybody downloads and validates those many transactions (this is how the network works in the end!). And NO, i don't demand to store that forever, as i am open to snapshot solutions / UTXO commitments / aquivalent solutions.


no need to swear. And let's stay with the facts, not personal emotions.

fully agree. when it comes to scaling bitcion, i 100% support the off-chain scaling approach lightning is going. I am running a full node on raspberry pi, and like the idea of a fully decentralized first blockchain-layer, where every small home user can contribute to the network and help securing it. This is bitcoin how it was meant to be.
If we really want to scale big-time (and i mean &gt; 10,000x times of tx throughput we have now), using the current blockchain system will lead to fullnodes being only managable through big data centers. The decentralized idea of btc would be gone. 
Another important point why i support lightning development is the fact, that i don't think the whole world has to store my coffee purchase transactions on their computer, it is just inefficient and wasting storage space. Blockchain is 160GB and counting. Off-chain scaling is THE solution. Doing things off-chain also significatly increases privacy.
On the other hand, i see that bitcoin in its *current form* is not usable for small transactions, BCH / LTC and others just work much better for this right now. For this reason, i WILL use and store some BCH/LCT right now for everyday transactions, low fee, instant transactions etc. And i can understand people which are doing the same. 
I just hope that development continues and adoption is fast enough that btc doesn't lose its market position in the mean time. New people flowing into cryptospace everyday, opinions about technology are tightened *right now*, and if people remember btc as slow and expensive, maybe abandoning the product before it is actually using next level technology scaling.
**TL;DR**: Technically, off-chain scaling is superior but not available right now. Current situation gives BCH/LTC a big usability advantage. Hope LN is ready for usage soon.

after reading deeply into it, i am convinced that this is the best answer to current scaling problems. i really hope LN is ready during the next months and gains traction. This technology is the only solution to the scaling problem, which allows an enormous increase in tx throughput on the one hand, while it doesnt boost up blockchain size much further on the other hand. Would be the perfect time to implement it right now. Big blocks are only a finite solution and will bottleneck again sooner or later (or btc network slowly moves into big centralised data centers). 
Time to start future is NOW.

@_date: 2019-12-02 18:41:22


no, the trade-off is avoidable. BTC has been working flawlessly until 2016 by transacting on-chain for near-zero fee using userfriendly open-source wallets. You were your own bank without commandline-skills and without relying on centralized 3rd party services. Then many core developers were exchanged and fixation of blocksize was decided ..... to give growth to centralized corporate products like liquid..... or unsafer unnecessarily-complex second layer solutions like lightning....
@_date: 2019-12-01 12:21:06


If you wanna force-close channels, always do it manually, one-by-one when your node is FULLY SYNCED.
Create SCBs (static channel backups) every time after opening a new channel and keep your 24 words seed.
After pressing the "RETRUN" button, don't panic, WAIT and don't press Ctrl + C (like me) instantly after that.
i think this is enough info to realize how far away from mass adoption LN really is..... i would call myself tech-savvy, but don't want to mess around with perCommitPoint, channel.db, UPS power supply, SCBs or be careful not doing many steps too quick after another......

@_date: 2017-11-03 18:37:05
true. One on-chain transaction if you want to settle. but as long as every participant plays by the rules, on-chain tx aren't necessary at all. Blockchain is only a backend to solve problems then, lightning transactions would become standard (afaik)

But - in a capitalist society - when a merchant accepts BCH, and buying BCH&amp;withdraw is cheaper then send BTC, i will choose the first (LTC/others accordingly). I think of it as a route-around-the-problem-until-solved.
And - thank god - btc is not my girlfriend ;)

no, LN is way more complicated, has many more error vectors, is forced hot-wallet, backup is more complicated and can ruin yourself if you do it wrong, LN is much more restricted concerning amounts and channel-imbalance etc., and incours the same fees when on-boarding, topping-up or re-balance channels..... NOT competitive from my point of view (although i take my hat off to the LN devs from the technological / cryptographical point of view)...

i personally trade on an timed "all-in/all-out" strategy, which worked quite good in the past. I will most definitely settle to base layer after the trade, so liquid brings no advantages for me. Also don't forget about the "emergency keys" that can be misused by a single entity after DDOS liquid for 1mon, and steal all the btc in liquid.
You are right with your "still better than trusting ONE exchange" though.... :)
would still prefer if Core would care a bit more about on-chain scaling instead developing &amp; deploying their semi-custodial solutions. LN still not usable &gt;1btc, we are waiting since 2015. What about Schnorr? What about a healthy new blocksize debate after years of improving hardware. I don't see much progress, maybe because core development is in ultra-slow mode.... or their main focus are profit-oriented L2 tools right now :(
@_date: 2019-09-10 21:06:34


indeed, technically, it is not the same. But if money is gone, i don't care if it was due to reorg or due to a RBF double spend. Gone is gone. 


yeah, but security doesn't come from high fees. If bocksize would've been increased, you could send 1billion with 1sat/byte and EQUAL security. fees add no extra security. 1sat/byte is equally safe after inclusion. 


that's simply wrong. both RBF and non-RBF are vulnerable to 51% attack in an equal manner. But double-spend risk is higher with RBF, because, just like the feature is called "REPLACE by fee", it is - right: replacable (by another tx)
@_date: 2019-09-10 17:18:03
i am usually pro-core, but in this aspect i see RBF-tx more "reorgable" (e.g. double-spendable) then Bch blockchain, which had only 1 reorg without negative consequences. During the sometimes long time i wait for conf on Btc, double spend is possible. On bch i am included next block and security grows way higher in a comparable amount of time.
@_date: 2019-09-01 15:36:25
"The problem is [...] no average Joe wants to first get BTC, then pay high fees to lock their BTC up on LN, then keep their wallet online 24/7, backup channel states, maintain a well routed node, etc.
They just want to open a wallet, send/receive money quickly, and then close the wallet and not have to worry about it until they need to do it again. They don't want to worry about the mempool, current sat/byte fees, RBF, 6 confirmations, etc."
user experience is horrible, if you are not moving to custodial expensive 3rd party solutions. i don't want to pay a fee to just "hold funds" in LN.
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:52:55
hashrate grows on btc everyday mostly due to the mining subsidy, not fees. Tx fees are negligible % of reward and have no impact on security. the "blocks have to be full for better security" rationale is nonsense...
@_date: 2019-09-29 12:05:26


yeah, from 1mb to effectively 1.2mb (biggest avg blocksize/24hr with segwit activated). still we have times of big congestion


biggest misconception! why did it work from 2009-2014? blocks were never full, you could send using 0sat/byte


kind of right, but effect is way too low to work as smart e-money. still way to expensive &amp; slow. Trust me, the blocksize lock was the biggest mistake in BTC history and will kill adoption before it even could gain traction

have you tried LN yet? 20$ is not possible. With multiple wallets i had 50$ locked away for possible force-close of channel. Amount spendable was negative right from the start.




a fair, open and unbiased discussion on blocksize increase is another option.


he once was open for on-chain scaling but seems to prefer custodial solutions right now
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:54:23


who says that bitcoin is not for micro transactions? Who defines what bitcoin is for? Bitcoin was designed as p2p money, including microtransactions, in 2009. The narrative changed years later, somehow "some people" mean that it shouldn't be for microtransactions anymore. There is no good reason not to cover the important market of micro transactions.


"more substantial" is a subjective term. is 50$ substantial? Why not 49$?


maybe you are right with this.... maybe not. All things offered for free are also abused quickly and not sustainable. Thus, i am highly sceptical of this theory.
Nevertheless, there is no good reason to allow microtransactions on BTC with low fees, as the time we live in, NOW, microtransactions play an important role.
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:26:05


they talk about this since 2015. No measurable progress for end users since then.


if users were fine to validate 1mb blocks in 2012, why is 1.5mb blocksize concidered "unsafe" in 2019 with increasingly better hardware? The "we need small blocks for better security" argument is not right anymore, it's just a narrative that never has been proven. 1.5mb would be possible today, easily.


a slight increase of blocksize would not result in a security downgrade. Where does this come from? any source?


i disagree. L2 still suffers major disadvantages and security flaws. 
- Malicious nodes can broadcast old channel states and steal money
- because of this, expensive watchtowers are necessary (3rd party, which can also have a downtime) or you are online 24/7 to watch blockchain yourself (and hope you don't lose electricity/internet connection and nothing happens to your watchtower hardware setup) to ensure no one steals youre money
- a big malicious hub could mass-broadcast old channel states to steal money in massive amounts, massive users have a small defined timeframe to act and prevent this attempt to steal money. as blocks are already full during normal usage, many people won't get their penalty tx included into blockchain on time (as fee can't be bumped up for those transaction) so large-scale theft will be successful. 
- channel rebalancing not solved yet (except using expensive on-chain tx)
- hardware wallet solutions difficult / not available, so only hot wallets possible (with possible key theft)
- LN not usable for larger amounts
- security flaws (like the on published recently) can cause unbacked LN-btc. You never know if there are more bugs, and if your LN-btc is fully backed and redeemable for sure.


but how will they rebalance / top-up? 


EVEN with a low Bch hashrate like it has right now, i concider Bch safer than LN (see arguments above, old ch. states, watchtowers, unbacked LN-btc bugs, hot wallet, and much more.......)
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:56:18
sadly, expensive on-chain transactions are still needed to onboard L2, and L2 still suffers major problems.
@_date: 2019-09-01 15:20:25


this is everything btc stands against..... same with liquid "federated" sidechain.
From my LN experience it is
- expensive to onboard
- complicated to manage 
- funds unspendable because "reserved for settlement fees"
- force close have fees pre-defined and those are high
- need to constantly monitor on-chain or buy an expensive node
- custodial solutions, which are against bitcoin's idea of "being your own bank"
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:08:57
again: this billion tx is an absolute rare scenario. Nevertheless, with low fees it would be equally safe.


can you elaborate why? let's please completely stick to BTC for simplicity, not overcomplicating things. the only thing a miner can cause using reorg is to prevent the transaction from being included. Can you explain what the benefit for the miner is in this case? If an (on BTC extremly expensive) reorg would be successful, you could just rebroadcast tx and another miner will include it. Please also beware, that low average fees don't mean that you aren't allowed to pay high nevertheless. You could still attach a 500$ fee to the tx to incentivise inclusion. The difference with big blocks is, you have to choice to pay high fee. With small blocks, you have no choice and always pay high.


why should the sender pay ransom? to whom? you only pay ransom if you are blackmailed. But that's not possible in this scenario...


do you have any facts supporting this? centralization on Bch is due to the lower market share, less people use it. I bet if we upgrade to 2mb blocks, it would NOT lead to less nodes, nodes would increase because bitcoin is usable again, bringing new people aboard.


that is clearly not due to low fees, but due to low hashrate on Bch. By the way, no one lost money to this reorg. If you want to be really safe, wait a few confirmations


can you elaborate how they would be possible to do that? Sender just re-broadcasts transaction until some friendly miner includes it. Attackers would have to constantly reorg for a long time, which costs a lot of money. Sender always wins in this case.


i don't have any bch, as i don't like the coin. But i like to stay with the facts and like to see development on BTC instead years of stagnancy.

Not suddenly, but constantly since 2015.
Things that result in an awful user experience are:
- Fee calculations. People don't want to do this kind of stuff. They want to send immediately without doing research before each transaction. So they tend to use bad fee calculators resulting in.....
- Bad fee calculations resulting in overpaying or stuck transactions. 
- People don't want to constantly monitor their transactions until confirmed after days 
- or even worse: tx have to be fee-bumped, causing user reintervention long after tx was published
- Long waiting times until confirmation. 0-conf got killed. RBF-tx are double-spendable. So everything fast, that worked flavlessly before, for low-amount tx is not usable anymore.
Larger blocksize fixes all of this. Segwit is a good invention and could stay as "segwit2x" or something like this
@_date: 2019-09-30 09:13:22
it's 3c in rare occasions. And still too high for micropayments in developing countries. LN not ready. Still a long way to wait how this develops.

it's adoption leading to higher node count, not the technical requirements that drop them. Ethereum, which has absurdly high hardware requirements for full-nodes, has a higher node count than bitcoin. Think about that!

blocksize increase would fix all problems i mentioned.


constantly modifying blocksize (dynamic blocksize according to tx amount needed) is what i would prefer, and this is not a temporary solution, it is a definitive solution. There are good algorithms already out there for this.


what you call the "problem" to "fix" is people TRANSACTING, and actually USING bitcoin. Yeah, you already fixed this by not scaling, steam and other big players already left because of fees.


i advocate for a dynamic blocksize, automatically changing blocksize according to need. As is explained above, this is NOT a temp solution, it's a definitive solution. There is no valid reason to not increase blocksize if it is needed by network.


yes, me too


source? where did it get tested, or "proven" wrong in practice? All i experienced was, that UX got constantly worse since 2013, and nobody did something meaningful against it. Segwit, which i support, is a drop in the sea as "scaling solution", however, is important to fix transaction malleability.


as i said, i support segwit, i don't want to undo it, and i am glad that it got included, as it fixes transaction malleability. However, its low capacity as "scaling solution" is long reached, other additional scaling solutions are needed urgently since 2017.


0-conf was a well accepted method for low value transactions when i entered the ecosystem 2012. If you buy a coffee, 0-conf has a perfect risk-to-reward ratio from security perspective. Now that the blocks are constantly full, 0-conf gets way less secure, as tx are often not included next block, and sometimes even never get included, but discarded after 2 weeks in mempool. Why 0-conf is "even safer" now is over my head, really can't follow this argument.


sure, all tx are double-spendable, that's right. But with non-full blocks, 0-conf offers a good risk-to-reward for small transactinons, with very high probability to be included next block. If someone double-spends my coffee-transaction with an enourmous effort (needs access to mining rigs preferably), then ok, take the 200sats.


It IS relevant, as RBF tx can be (as the name "replace-by-fee" already suggests) replaced (and this way double-spent), while classic transactions' replacements are rejected by honest nodes by protocol ("not-replacable").

can you elaborate on that? system was working perfectly before 2014 without any subsidy.

this wont be the case for a looong time. Fee % is negligible in relation to whole block reward. And this will stay for many years. If we are at a point where block reward goes down to a point where mining becomes unprofitable and hashrate plummets to a point where network gets unsecure (somewhere &gt;2100yr), then we should limit blocksize with a simple soft-fork again to increase fees (or switch to a different algo like more ecofriendly POS or equivalent).


and it is still not 0, and wont be zero until 2140

to be precise, you trust "11-out-of-15" exchanges, the multi-sig where your btc is locked away, or the "emergency keys" which become active if liquid is non-functional for 1month.
If this group of exchanges decides to misuse your BTC (e.g. end the L-BTC/BTC peg), money gone. With all the hype about liquid, we shouldn't forget that this is a "federated" sidechain. Trust is with the federation instead of an exchange!

mining subsidy is still main income for miners. Fees are NOT needed to "secure" the network right now.
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:16:27


it's the other way around. Devs force a new technology onto users. It's called segwit. Which requires software updates in wallets etc. Don't mix cause and impact.


can you elaborate? who grants a subsidy to whom?


can you elaborate? why not? segwit2mb would be a good solution for current problems right now. Full blocks are NOT needed for the system to function.

Sounds interesting! ELI5?

Just tested the proposed Blue Wallet. Thoughts:
- custodial :(
- if i want to top up, i need a separate BTC wallet in the app. Why? Technically this is not necessary. I thought the whole point of LN is to recude UTXO size on L1. By forcing me to create a separate BTC wallet, it takes the idea ad-absurdum.
- services like LNbig, which open a channel to me (otherwise i have to pay up to 50$ on-chain fee like in Dec 2017) are not supported it seems(?)
- no possibility to close channel and withdraw to the in-app BTC wallet (da fuq?!)


You compare to on-chain fees, which are artifically bloated because unnecessary blocksize limit. 
You should compare your whole experience to BTC, when blocks were not full. No custodian. No channels. Balance fully spendable. No top-up. No blockchain monitoring/watchtowers. No backing up channel states (seed is enough). No fee calculation for top-up on-chain transactions. No routing failure. And much more!
By the way: blueWallet centralized solution is vulnerable against shutdown by authorities. Money gone.
