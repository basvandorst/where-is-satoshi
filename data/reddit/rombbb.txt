I'm sipping tea in the east tower of my holiday mansion, just fresh out of my spa, petting my tiger, chilling and relaxing.
Later on will go to the restaurant in town I bought, then back on my private jet back to mainland, to my 2nd holiday estate.

Dont know Ver Coin but am pretty new to crypto.
Do know Vertcoin and find that indeed a cool name. Am actually mining it, like their mining for the people philosophy.
Made some investments but it went down and now in BCH. Also like that one a bit better than BTC (which I also like), because they simply did what had to happen already a long time ago, while keeping the upgrade in line with original Bitcoin roadmap.
Such a simple upgrade, just raise the block as required, no problems whatsoever with it anymore (costs and speed).
And I guess it has more upside potential (but downside potential as well of course). 
Anywhow, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 .......

That's true. I was in a bit of a black-white mood when wrote it. Am a relative layman and just got a bit allergic from the gazillion technical analysts during last bull-bear run. But of course can't deny that reality is more nuanced and probabilities are certainly a thing (I'm not good at ;-)

Technical analysis = ooblakahoola fortune teller.
People using hopium are more realistic than people kidding themselves they consistently can predict price movements by calculating stuff with fancy names like Big MACD, your nice moving averages and the 5 waves of Elliott (not 6, not 4, but 5, just because !).
Everything's different depending on the time frame you use, choice of which is purely subjective.
Who said that 'tested and true techniques' suit totally new industries like crypto ?
One regulator stepping in can break your 'quantitative system' in a sec.
So many variables that hopium does just as well, if not better because at least your not giving in to a false sense of control.
