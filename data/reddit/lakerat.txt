That looks really cool but I'm afraid that if I complicate things too much I'll end up Karpelessing myself.

Excellent point.  
I've been using bitcoin for a while, but never delved into paper wallets and offline storage.  I'm definitely going to go through the process (and reverse it) with small sums a couple of times before going through with the large amount.

The bitcoin community needs to flood this guy's opponent with bitcoin campaign donations.

Perfect.  Thank you!

Same. Got a phishing email yesterday. It's a relatively new email account and I haven't had any at all before this. Could be a coincidence but...
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:33:23
Thanks.  There isn't much localbitcoin activity in my area, and I'm hoping to avoid the bit premium that the nationwide localbitcoins people charge.  Anyone know which online exchange will get coins into my wallet the fastest at close to the current market price?

Would it even be possible for them to have gotten insurance that covers bitcoin loss or theft?  Bitcoin is such a new and evolving technology. I have doubts about whether any insurance company would even understand it, much less underwrite it.

Does this guy have a BTC donation address?
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:18:32
The background info on bitcoin in his press release is taken from, appropriately enough, [Bitcoin for idiots: An introductory guide](  Much of it has been lifted word-for-word with no attribution.
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:49:53


Based on this line I'd say it's not so much that he's talking to interested buyers and pitching it as a good investment.  Rather, he's going to big players in the bitcoin world and begging them for a bailout based on the idea that if gox fails it will have a bad impact on bitcoin.

*"...using a technology based on raid."* 
Does this mean [RAID]( as in the electronic disk-based RAID storage technology? Or is there another meaning that I'm not aware of?  
Or maybe they mean they were using the concept of RAID in an offline environment by splitting up the private keys into three parts that were stored in three separate physical locations?  Anyone have any further info on this?

Great analysis. I wonder whether the BTC hashrate dropped by a similar amount, or if this all new miners...
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:03:41
Ugh. If they can't keep up now imagine what's going to happen once BCH trading opens.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:09:43
And unfortunately they didn't update everyone's balance at once, so I'm sitting here at 0 waiting for my credit while I watch everyone else have all the fun.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:07:27
Thanks, but no luck here. "Insufficient funds."
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:17:34
The difficulty wasn't supposed to adjust yet. Assuming it hasn't, there's likely a LOT more hash power pointed at this chain that previously predicted.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:52:14
Where is the fork being traded at 0.01 BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:54:31
Here are the stats for the most recently mined BCH block: 
The reported difficulty matches BTC's difficulty. Either:
1. The software is reporting a different difficulty than is actually being used
2. There's a LOT more hash power pointed at BCC than anyone anticipated.
3. The miners just got EXTREMELY (statistically nearly impossibly) lucky.
@_date: 2011-06-22 14:48:57
Point taken.  I realize that this is a risky type of trade.  I guess what I'm looking for is suggestions to help mitigate the risk as much as possible.

For the sake of argument: All patents held by Google, Apple, and any other companies who won't follow UK law are rendered unenforceable in the UK, paving the way for other companies who WILL follow the rules to steal the technology and start marketing replacements within the UK. Now what?

Thanks. I did go ahead and request the Bitcoin withdrawal. Unfortunately, coinbase now tells me that they're placing a 72 hour hold on the withdrawal, but I can "accellerate" the withdrawal by sending a photo of my ID.
So... I uploaded my I'd and got a confirmation email that they accepted it and I'm now identity verified. Unfortunately, my pending withdrawal is still shown as "72 hour hold" with the option to accelerate the withdrawal by providing my ID.
Of course, in 72 hours it will be too late. This is maddening. I'm so done with coinbase after this. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:08:49
Interesting. Was the delayed transaction a large amount compared to the successful transaction? Some people are speculating that Coinbase is delaying larger transactions while letting smaller ones through.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:50:07


Could an argument be made for a cost basis higher than $0 based on the fact that one must own BTC in order to get BCC?
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:50:00
FYI, my smaller test transfer of BTC from CoinBase to my own wallet just completed a few hours ago. It sat in "pending" on CoinBase for 15 hours before finally being pushed out to the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:43:09
From their blog post about not supporting BCC:


Before 11:59 pm on July 31st huh? I'm starting to doubt that the withdrawal I initiated several days before that will even make it through in time. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:02:12
So at best we can only see an updated estimate after each block is mined?
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:32:37
Crap. I initiated my final transfer about an hour ago. Fingers crossed.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:16:57
Yep. I've already taken screenshots. I was actually pretty surprised when I saw them post that. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:41:51
Withdrew early yesterday and it took 15 hours. Initiated another one almost 6 hours ago and still waiting.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:57:25
I'm not confident they'll be able to deliver on this. A transaction I initiated early yesterday morning took 15 hours to process and judging by the comments I'm seeing online it's only getting longer as time goes on. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:24:15
Can you explain, or point me to an explanation of why it's risky to make btc transactions right after the fork?
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:00:10
I'd love to see a live graph of the hashrates of both BTC and BCH as the fork progresses.
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:02:04
Oops.  My mistake.  So I guess the question is, can the market handle transactions of $32 million?  Theoretically could it handle a transaction of $350 million?
