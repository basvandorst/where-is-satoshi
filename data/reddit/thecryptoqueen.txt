Please, do read the rest! I'm in NYC, hardly an irrelevant location..

Believe me I would've...but then you get labeled an "emotional" woman and no one takes you seriously.

Very helpful thanks! Added a quick note in right now. I am literally falling asleep on my keyboard but will clarify further in the AM if still confusing

You are correct, and that makes my point even more true :) I was just taking the worst possible scenario, one in which they COULD crash the system.

Thanks for the comment! That's useful. Why exactly is it confusing? Let me know so I can clarify, thanks!

Thanks! Based in NYC but will swing by next time I'm in LA

Thanks for the sentiment! However there's a reason I didn't put his name there. Destroying him is not my point

Totally agree. Even if bitcoin is not the *only* currency in effect, having an alternative that can sustain the economy if things go south is absolutely fundamental.

I have a red Yamaha fz6.

I guess it depends what your expectation benchmark is. I figured it would drop by a lot more than it did :)

You, my friend, are the man. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:17:02
Hahahaha well thanks...but I was trying to have a serious conversation at this meetup, not be hit on 
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:56:59
Haha, I do. No gossip though!
