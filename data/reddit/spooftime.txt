It depends.  Do you plan on holding the bitcoin indefinitely or long term, or if you plan on liquidating it immediately into fiat.
If you are holding it and have an amount that is significant to you, buy a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor, and make a request to the poker to send the bitcoin to the address you will set up with your hardware wallet.
If you prefer to liquidate, then setup an account on an exchange, have the bitcoin sent there, then sell the bitcoin for fiat.  Of course, you will need to shop around for rates to see what works best for you.
I hope this helps.  Good luck!

If you are located in Canada (like myself), you can use a website like ndax.io
Otherwise, I am not sure who I would recommend based on your country...

For such a speculative investment, the right amount is whatever you ate comfortable with losing entirely.  
If the answer to that question is zero, then bitcoin isn't for you.  If you have a comfort zone, then invest within it.
