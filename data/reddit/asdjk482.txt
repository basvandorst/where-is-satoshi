Yeah, it’s not true, “bear market” is a term that’s been around significantly longer than its counterpart and likely has its origins in the colonial bearskin trade.

I’m an anarchist opposed to the entire existence of the state and capitalist economies, but I can’t help but point out the sheer stupidity of comparing sovereign debt to personal household debt. They aren’t the same things, they don’t work the same way, and the popularity of the totally unjustified comparison is a dishonest conservative trick to get ignorant people to support exploitative fiscal policies.

Not only is that not obvious, I don’t think it’s even true. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 06:18:49
It’s not like that at all. A state economy is not like a household. The respective relationships to currency and financial markets are pretty much opposite.

It’s not that debt’s good for the economy, debt *is* the economy. Where do you think currency comes from?

Issue 5 should be issue  if ranked by severity.

A ‘bubble of privileged cruelty’ is actually a great description of US libertarianism.

Sovereign debt is not the same as personal debt, not even remotely. They should probably stop using the same term to avoid this confusion.

I’m not a huge fan of neoliberal economics, but maybe you *should* take econ 101 so that you’ll know when you don’t know what the hell you’re talking about. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 06:23:55
But it doesn’t help understanding when it’s just flat-out wrong.

I sure wouldn’t count on it though.

So, what government is running an economy without incurring debt? 
@_date: 2018-10-26 06:21:21
When the state spends money, what is it that’s being spent? Where does that money come from, where does it go, and what relationship does that spending have to measures of economic productivity and currency value? 
Please, stop and think about it for longer than two seconds.

I don’t follow. How is optimism going to create new energy sources? Is pessimism what’s preventing cold fusion? 
I want to make the world a better place, but I don’t see how hoping for sci-fi to save us is going to help.

Thanks for exemplifying why we need a capital gains tax.
