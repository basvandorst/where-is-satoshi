Well...it more or less makes them not related to you. You send them from one address. You have other bitcoins sent to another address. Those BTC that you bought off website.x is now cleaned and untrackable to you.

What do you think about net neutrality and the ISP fucking over the customers and blocking fiber from rolling out.

Your are still assuming that BTC will be at the price they are. What if next year at this time they are at 10x what they were today just like last year. Today im still making $2 a day if next year they are at 10x I would have been making $20 a day. Making payback only in 13 days. If you save them.

... I dont understand. Dollar (used to be) backed by gold, gold was/is worth something. But math isn't worth shit.

Could you start assigning numbers to the gift cards? And then have that number on the receipt? Especially on large amounts. I really doubt this would happen again. But it could keep some people safe. Maybe for anything over $100 get a scan of their ID and the receipt? 
IDK just spitting out ideas to see if any are good.

The year is 2032. Mining as long since stopped. BTC are at a year low of only $110,367.64 each. OP is able to pay for his son's college in full and OP's son gets a nice new BMW like all the new BTC kids.

Thank you for the fast replay. Is CampBX safe? I would use localbitcoins but I live in a smaller town.

 THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE. It says exactly were they are in this shipping process. They are hand made. Not mass produced. There was disclaimers everywhere. That they were ordering pre-orders and might not get their unit for some time. All he had to do was send a PM on the forum/create a thread and he would have easily got someone. He is just pissed off that he spend 5 BTC that he paid ~$100 for and now they are going for over $700.

They have a warranty.

Sorry I swear I got it in late July but apparently according to the tracking number I got August 30, 2013 , 2:18 pm. And the 2Gh/s upgrade was $100 + the original $149 + $14 s/h (see image). So the total was $263. Sorry for all this mis-info I posted from my phone I was doing it all by memory. 
Also the reason I got it was if your read the forum you knew that others were going to be delayed as everything moved up one case size.

Well sucks for you. I ordered a 5Gh/s manner and got the 2+GH/s upgrade around Feb 2. Total was 274 with shipping. Got them in July. I hooked them up to my server and started Minning 24/7. Cable broke and I missed a week of Minning. Even with that I made over $1300 on btc sold at 1000. Its peoples own fault not watching this shit closely. I ordered one and the 5 GH/s as they were shipping the fastest and paid in cash as I knew BTC would go up.
