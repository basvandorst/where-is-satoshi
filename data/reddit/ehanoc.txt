@_date: 2018-01-24 11:09:57
How many countries exist out there that it's people cannot trust their own governments? You may like and trust yours, which might be a bit naive, but crypto is global and it helps a lot of people right now that need it.
This falls into more philosophical discussion than crypto itself. But governments are given power by people so they can govern the system that we all contribute to for the benefit of all of us. All these systems came at the time we couldn't develop trustless systems. Now we can.  
I submit that decentralisation systems are one of the best tools ever developed to keep governments in check. And it's a good thing.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:26:37
This. Also people that know what they are doing don't simply follow the herd mentality of "just hodl" and only trust points-of-view in the echo-chambers that is specific crypto's sub reddits.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:16:23
Don't look for advice in memes. Everyone will tell you to hodl or buy.  
If you're uncomfortable losing the money you invested. There's no shame in protecting yourself and ride the rest with some peace-of-mind.

There is a handful of people that make sense being Satoshi. The Bitcoin documentary on Netflix covers this nicely. And this dude is not one of them. 
My bet is that Nick Szabo + Hal Finney agreed on a pseudonym. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:45:42
Yup.  That's why we need a new generation of wallets (specially mobile) that are literally scan &amp; go. 
Regular users aren't going to bother in creating &amp; maintaining lightning channels for example.
For all the UI / UIX wizards out there... go crazy. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:55:52
This is so bluntly misleading and false. 
You can't claim to have scalability without having reached scale. Most altcoins wait for bitcoin blockchain innovations to integrate on their own projects. 
And btw, ethereum is having scalability issues too. Blockchain's are slow by nature. 
Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum are the only projects at this moment that can really test their scalability solutions.

Yeah you can exchange them.
But try to make your case to people that had their assets froze, law suits and their lives thrown in complete chaos because they received "tainted" coins. 
In real life, even $ or € bills don't have a transaction history stamped in them...
As a user, i want to be protected by such cases. Monero protects me, Bitcoin does not.

Why is this being down voted? This is a legitimate concern. Either Tether is backed by USD or is not. 
A lot of crypto was bought with tether, if it turns out they just printed tether, it inflated the price. 
For these reasons the whole hodl/buy memes with no justification are borderline irresponsible and intellectually contemptable. 
Not everything is FUD or an attack. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:25:12
First of all, congrats on your returns. Well done.
Unpopular opinion here, but, i also don't believe in the whole "just hodl" mentality. But i do believe in the technology, i'm not in JUST to make money, i believe in it.
And it's smart to take incrementally some profits out to project yourself and diversify. 
But why would you just take it all? Sounds like you were just lucky. It could have went up straight to 50k and might still... You have just taken an possible big opportunity away from yourself.
Furthermore, if you think the tech is the real value here, why would you put your entire returns in the old system.

The whole market does care. After this whole hype period, what are seeing is a selloff after people are losing confidence. Also negative media attention and what not.
The project did promised decentralisation, privacy, censor resistance, fast p2p transfers... Now, I still believe in Bitcoin, but most people that joined this last year are in it just for the money ( nice but kind of missing the point ).
Bitcoin needs to prove itself once again with more adoption of users/merchants and adoption of its scalability solutions. 
This whole "just hodl", "to the moon" herd mentality is not constructive, neither it helps the newest people understand the purpose, current stage and future of the project. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:54:11
Yup, just keep following the herd. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:50:21
Every negative view point is FUD of course. Be a good hodler all the way down.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:22:19
this! No one knows! 
But if the technology delivers, is one of the most revolutionary &amp; disruptive systems we have conceived. Then it's way under priced. 
If it doesn't deliver or people don't adopt it... it will take some time for some other tech of the same nature to do so. The price will likely suffer for a while.
Don't listen to the herd mentality of "just hodl". Protect yourself. It's no shame to take returns from time to time. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:32:12
Yeah, a BIT conservative :D ... Maybe increaseBy(takeYourGuessHere) is more appropriate .  
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:06:06
Unpopular opinion.... (Yes, let's not become an echo chamber of "just hodl" &amp; "to the moon" memes ) 
I'm a strong believer in bitcoin &amp; crypto... but after the hype period, weak hands are getting off and even the techies are thirsty for the increase of adoption in use and in the implemented solutions for scalability. 
Wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin wouldn't see these high prices again until it proves itself again.

What is this thing called HTTP? 
How long did you thought about this before posting? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:46:33
Because I'm entitled to opinions and express them. I love the tech. And I think that some form of this tech is here to stay.
But, there's a bit of an echo chamber around. There are barriers, hurdles and risks outside tech that might impact things in a substantial way. Just posting memes about hodling, buy the dip and lambos are not constructive neither given the newcomers a realistic view of the risks. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:00:47
Timing for scaling is the critical bit here. Bitcoin is becoming mainstream. It's now or people will lose confidence in the project.

@_date: 2017-12-12 16:09:40
Just to clarify, in bitcoin, although you can't counterfeit, it's very possible to trace coin to previous "illicit" uses.
Does anyone know if there's plan to address fungibility? Monero keeps looking ahead of the game in this. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:55:15
I'm happy to see that this community is actually openly discussing more the issues, risks and problems of the project without blindly just shout "hodl".
After the whole mania period in the media, it might go even lower than now, but, lightning is up so let's get that moving and see how it goes. 
This is not just about price people. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:15:04
I understand Segwit is already live. But for someone as me, who is a wallet developer, often we depend on other implementations...
Bitcoin core wallet doesn't support it yet and in my case, i'm waiting for bitcoinj to have it implement it too... Just seem so slow.
Do you have any points on LN adoption? Any projections? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:52:57
Not sure if i agree. Lots of projects base their implementations on other projects that have better competency in a particular domain. As in this case. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:40:34
That's not really helpful is it? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:27:02
Bitcoin's price needs to stabilise at some point for people to be more comfortable using it and become an actual "currency". 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:56:34
I've mailed coinbase asking for segwit. They replied saying that they have already posted their views on Forks.....
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:16:10
You might be up to something there. Monero does seem light years away in terms of privacy. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:31:37
True to that. Also, core needs to release their wallet with segwit support. There's loads of wallets who use it as a dependency. And then there's the exchanges... 
Segwit adoption has been a sh*t show 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:55:41
A lot of wallets depend on core. There's a Pull Request on github with a lot of activity &amp; review on Segwit Wallet Support. 
Check it out
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:38:10
I'm happy that you trust governments so much. so much so you can trust them with your money, your future, your information. You should also be joyful that you weren't born in Zimbabwe or live in Venezuela
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:34:14
 show's the projects dependencies... Loads still waiting for core to support it on their wallet.
Implementing it at the protocol level is not the same as implementing it as a client. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:27:15
Bitcoin isn't a commodity and nothing has decentralized really existed. Decentralized doesn't just mean that there's multi points of entry / attack, it's also about control. Blockchain tech underlying bitcoin solves a very old problem. How could we build a functional system without a central trust-controlling party?
You talk about markets and it's the government's job to keep scarcity... with bitcoin i don't have to trust them to do their job or not-be corrupt, it's pure mathematics and transparent.
Government's fear cryptocurrencies because they can't control it. I say that's a good thing. Government's should be afraid of their people, not the other way around. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:29:43
Government's are also responsible for the destruction of progress and other civilizations. This whole "team" game has always one lion and a sheep. People / Groups that have too much power need to be put in check. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:49:42
I think what you are describing makes sense to a certain point. But becoming a niche market wasn't really the goal of the project.
There are millions of people that can't get a bank account and need to trade in small amounts. 
I'm not a big blocker, but truth is, no one really knows how well will LN work. Just look at Segwit, barely anyone is really using it and Core doesn't even release their client update to support it. 
Saying that people should just use altcoins to trade instead, signals failure on the premise for what bitcoin set out to achieve. 
Imo, scaling &amp; anonymity need to be addressed ASAP ( as we become mainstream ) or it's really plausible that bitcoin might lose confidence from the market.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:31:22
I'm a hodler, but serious question, doesn't bitcoin needs to somewhat stabilize for people to actually transact it? 
If the project really succeeds, there won't be really a need to cash it out. We would just use bitcoin normally.  What am i missing ? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:25:06
Do you know if as a user, i need to "find" a channel? I'm wondering if is as easy as "pay" or if there is more steps. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:23:22
That's right. Just follow the herd and keep hodling all the way down
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:14:01
Yup, everyone is selling
@_date: 2018-06-30 08:26:44
I'm not talking about the efficiency of new mining hardware... Which by the way, is really expensive. 
Mining (bitcoin) is a massive operation these days, with a lot resource consumption. The barrier of entry to compete is getting gigantic.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:55:28
For people downplaying this, saying that wouldn't be at Bitmain's interest to temper with their majority 51&amp; "powers"; True, but that's trusting in one single entity way too much. 
What if someone on their side does a mistake, the 51&amp; majority allows any small mistake to be disastrous.
That also makes Bitmain a target for everybody to try to hack, corrupt, bribe and manipulate. 
Let's stick to the principles that got us here. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:31:52
The average cost of mining 1 BTC is at almost 5k$ (Source : [ ).  
Wouldn't make much sense to drop below that (unless the hashrate drops), as it would be better to buy it straight up. 
Important to note that China's average cost is at below 4k$. 
Take your guesses, but i would say that big time investors won't give people a chance to buy near the mining cost.

@_date: 2018-06-29 13:25:52
No one questions that is revolutionary. But none of you people that fell for the hodl meme, can honestly point out the technical flaws with the system that need to be addressed. And they might be in the future, but doesn't even mean that they will succeed, adopted or that even bitcoin will retain it's marketshare dominance. 
You are falling for a herd mentality &amp; confirmation bias 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:43:01
That's not entirely true. Just because Bitmain wouldn't have any incentives to temper with the chain doesn't mean it's not a worrying situation. 
It makes them a target for hacking, bribes, manipulation, etc. 
Others can move into the space, but it's getting harder and harder to compete with ASIC's manufacture. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:40:25
Of course it keeps improving. But have you ever heard and paid attention to opposing views of yours? Sounds like your closed off to criticisms. 
There are technical challenges and some solutions don't have any guarantees of working. Or, how about this. They might work but not get adopted. History is filled with brilliant products that just didn't got adopted. Time will tell. Or do you think this is all 100&amp; certain?
I don't have a "fiat" mentality, so much so that i'm a dev and investing my career in blockchain tech. But i do not deal in absolutes or close my mind to other points of view or criticisms. Decentralised tech is here to stay , but being 100&amp; confident and blindly bet everything on bitcoin is delusional and shows a lack of perspective. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:03:12
How does tor affect the blockchain itself? You don't know what you're talking about. Anyway, Monero guys are working on Kovri which masks the initial IP that broadcasts a tx. Does Bitcoin does that? No. 
Good luck getting the kind of same data you get from Bitcoin in Monero. 
And yes, you can get Monero without btc. But even if you get BTC, how do you track what exactly the user is doing with his money after that point? That's right, you don't.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:24:04
Gross!!!!! That's a lot of blood! Has anyone heard from him yet? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:49:38
Right, so tor doesn't affect the blockchain. And using monero doesn't make you automatically a criminal by the way. I know what you're trying to imply but you should know better being a cop. 
I would like you to explain what information you can really deduce from that tx even without ct (which afaik it only hides amounts).
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:03:39
good. cheap coins. Monero is so far ahead of the game in privacy, making this news actually quite funny.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:59:04
It's still early to tell I think. But even if they wanted to... How could they? The same way they can't stop bitcoin, it's decentralised. And with monero they can't tell who sends, receives or owns xmr. And very soon even the user's IP's when they broadcast a transaction is going to be masked. 
I can't see how, but I'm open to ideas. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:33:09
Do your research of course. But it's hardly an "alt' as it's not a bitcoin clone in any way, was started from scratch and the community actually funds scientists &amp; cryptographers to do their own research.

Thanks bud, but don't worry, i'm grand
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:13:27
- Crypto Ad ban impacts exposure to crypto companies, therefore, arguably there's less value for them in bitcoin, less business, less txs, impacts price. 
- Mt. Gox folks &amp; whales selling off big amounts drops the price. 
Now, this is probably the best time in a long time to actually use bitcoin.
- Fees are considerably lower than 2 months ago
- Faster confirmation times
- Segwit adoption % is increasing, companies already testing Lightning network. The Scaling debate might be in it's final stretch.
Next issue to tackle might be Privacy / Fungibility. And prepare for massive crackdown on Bitcoin from banks / government agencies. 
But i'm a tech guy, so i don't know about investments or price moves. But bitcoin is dealing with every roadblock like a f'ing champion. Technically speaking, the project continues to show all the promises for a future currency or what backs some-form of currency / value. 
I'm a believer
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:12:08
Go away. Enough of this stupid hodl mentality. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 09:02:55
Since we're throwing in random guesses, here's mine.
Tech is evolving, but this year, we're not seeing much adoption, public interest is declining, more governments attention &amp; regulations... 
We're going down. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:38:35
If you don't understand or not up to date with the project developments, you should give summaries on something else. 
This is misleading and inaccurate information that might influence newcomers or the easy-influenced. You might get away with this on subreddits where people only care about drawing lines on charts, but more technical subs are going to call you on the BS / bogus analysis.  
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:11:45
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:53:24
With Monero, you can't. Unless you give away or lose your spend key, no chain analysis known to date will reveal that information. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:32:59

@_date: 2018-03-29 14:37:57
Sound. Timing bottom is always really hard though. 
But overall, i think it's oversold at the moment. 
As a tech guy, there's a lot of things happening that the general public isn't aware yet. And we're falling below the average upwards trend line.
I would be shocked if we hit 6k as a bottom.

@_date: 2018-02-15 09:50:46

Scaling, Adoption, Privacy, Regulations, Competition and reasonable price stability for validation as a currency
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:04:44
The truth is somewhere in the middle. But i do think there is a case for Bitcoin being currently way overpriced.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:08:25

How much does a 1T drive costs?
Same argument you make for Monero can be done for Bitcoin. Everyone is working on shrinking txs size. 
This has been debated to death. 160GB is the price you pay for a decentralised, censured resistant, trustless system. Do you know a better way to do it ? Because so far, alternatives are yet to be seen.

@_date: 2018-02-06 14:41:54
See, be careful with your claims when you don't really know. 
You're most likely talking about the posts about the IP broadcast being visible. Which by the way, are visible for every crypto. Monero is the only community (afaik) that is addressing this right now. 
Btw, Zcash is a disaster of a project by claiming it's a truly anonymous currency. Centralized, it's privacy features are not default, and no proof of it's fungibility. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:35:27
No. But i would imagine that they have been keeping up with cryptocurrencies &amp; blockchain tech though. So wouldn't be surprised if they just state "we're going to look into it".

When you sell / buy you don't have to "wager" all your available funds. You can buy or sell amounts that you are comfortable with. 
Now, if you can't afford to lose all this money you have but you still want some skin in the game. Buy in with a smaller amount.

Thats why you still have the same amount of coins and I have more than I used to
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:14:15
That's a very specific definition of merchant. You have people selling digital goods &amp; services too.

You don't need a full node to use bitcoin... 
Segwit was added a few months ago, next is Schnorr signatures. Do your research, it's all available for you to get more educated on what's going on.

No, this is contemptible. Privacy isn't just for criminals. 
I don't want you to know how much money i have,  or have my information sold given away, having my transactions tracked and on what so someone can target me with specific ads. And more importantly, it's my earned money, i don't want to be bullied, intimidated or censored for what i do with it. 
Don't even get me started on fungibility...

Username = RESEARCH! But not a single mention on the technical improvements and the adoption of batching by the major exchanges = NO RESEARCH

Bitcoin has never seen so much development as now.
Blockchain is 160+ GB for 10 years of history .....
Monero needs more space for the transactions to mask the addresses. It's just a smaller project and have you tried to download the blockchain? 
Just shows how much you really know 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:49:54
Do i owe you something? If you want someone to explain the incoming tech improvements, it's all available online in depth.
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:49:10
Sounds cool. I'll have a look. Thanks
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:10:08
And that's all of course

I'm also a software engineer with twice your years. 
Besides bitcoin and ethereum, which projects can actually prove scale of their features at these highs of usage? 
Which blockchain project has more active development and contributes the most with innovations to the blockchain tech? Most altcoins merge the improvements from bitcoin. and why wouldn't they?
This project has more to it than price. You as a software engineer should understand this.

This herd mentality of blindly hodl is stupid.

Eventually everything is settled on the chain. Only if you have multi-hops between channels you might ommit certain transactions because this get settled when you close the channel. 
But still, all the sender, receiver for the channel transactions are visible, as the amount that was settled. And, no coins in bitcoin are fungible so they have a history. 
Not really private
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:28:06
Have heard of segwit and Schnorr signatures? There's active development in decreasing txs sizes... You don't know what you're talking about. 
If you can't afford a 1T drive, you don't run a full node, simple. Very affordable in the technology space. 
Still, you know nothing.

We need a meme for people that claim to know what will happen to the market
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:23:55
See you all at $2k 
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:12:46
This. 
Although i must say, the lack of privacy in bitcoin is going to be used by the powers-that-be. They are going to find ways to deter it's use by you, companies, merchants, etc ... .
After scalability i hope bitcoin addresses privacy to protect us from the over-reaching powerful entities.

You think bitcoin is the same as online banking? Or you're saying paypal is? 
If you can't understand why decentralisation and consensus networks are important, you need to do more research because you're way behind.
This is the first time EVER, that we can build systems without a central party control in a trustless manner. 
Paypal is centralised and has been hacked several times. Last time i've heard they had a data breach which hackers stole millions of users data. 
Bitcoin's network has never been hacked and you don't need to trust anyone with your data &amp; funds. 
Makes sense? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:49:14
For these reasons and others, the bitcoin community should be more aware of Monero.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:27:57
Chill padawans. This might be a trap. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:52:14
You made me go check the sub-reddits of those shitcoins. I need a shower now
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:50:00
I believe in bitcoin but I'm not stupid. Do you have a full node running? Because that's how you help bitcoin. All this price stuff means little
@_date: 2018-07-03 09:41:45
There's barely any volume though. Just big spikes and then "silence".

Yes of course, there should be more detailed modes for knowledgeable people. But average Joe won't understand multi\-layered solutions by default.  
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:43:52
I think about building something similar, but it bothers me that those concepts are forced. 
I'm trying to figure out something of the lines of :
If trying to make payments to ln addr AND no channels open or path to address :
Open &amp; Fund channel, wait for confirmation, and send ( otherwise reuse previous channels )
Also, counting Balance, there would be extra work on considering both layers? 
There is loads of edges cases, but I think it's possible.

Roger is such a child. Around 10:54 he get's offended because according to him, bcash is a derogatory term.
