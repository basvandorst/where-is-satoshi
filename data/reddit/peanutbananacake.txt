The user you asked your question to is a bot, try asking him what is the result of the addition of three plus seven hahaha

You are speaking in an echo chamber, don't expect much unfortunately :)
BTC can't work as a currency for the moment and no improvements has been seen that supports the rise in value.
I agree with you, there is a problem.

Yes you are living in an echo chamber in this sub.

This I get but I mean a stability on a geopolitical point of view? A single country can only maintain its influence for so long, every empire falls at some point.
However we could have reached a point where countries are so intertwined that the US can't fall without bringing everyone down with it. I don't know.

The article states that there will not be inflation if the USD supply is freely increased because demand is so high that it can absorb all the new supply.
I think this is not correct, no one wants to be bound to a currency they do not control so naturally counties will naturally want to break free from this external control. Basically if the USD is the world reserve currency and you are not a US citizen you won't be happy. This is not a stable situation long term.
Therefore I don't think the demand will forever keep up with the bigger supply of USD.

Sure but I would like to know what you think if you care to share, I would tend to agree with the article but since their assumption seems a bit off I am left in doubt.
USD being the world reserve currency is in my opinion not a long term stable point of equilibrium, what do you think? ��

Your deserve an upvote and some

This makes no sense
Because the relative increase is what matters not the absolute value 
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:38:54
50% is a kind estimate haha
@_date: 2019-01-07 13:10:08
This actually makes sense

This is exactly what I am going through, it starts clicking after more than a year of crypto reading. Next step is to start running my own node on a pi!

BIS report?

Thanks for sharing. 
I agree with the thought that crypto currency such as btc do not play the role of a currency.
I am also glad to learn about an estimation of the actual crypto users. 
The other sources preaching 100% dollar stability do not convince me totally.
Considering everything it seems btc could have a store of value function but with no demand it won't, so unless there is an unexpected trigger it is not the best sov right now and looks more like a gamble. However should such an event occur you d be better off having some just in case.
I remain interested in altcoins that leverage blockchain tech to bring new ways to interact with the digital world. It d be sad to see their development stop because btc disappears. 
Thanks for sharing, have a great day!
Edit : brainwashing goes both ways, when everyone believed earth was flat you d have looked pretty stupid trying to find an alternative and preaching it. Here we talk economics which is in not an exact science so yeah there are dissidents, the fact that they are a minority does not imply they are right or wrong he he

Thanks you are so kind!

I would add he is biased af I m reading it right now
@_date: 2018-12-19 03:15:05
I feel that he is not presenting its reflexion in a scientific way. He presents its Austrian views as if they were the only truth and dismiss the opposing ideas without properly presenting them (sometimes using ad hominem arguments), what kind of work is that?
To me, it would be much more interesting and relevant to present the two points of view in detail and then conclude why his views are above.
What I am currently reading looks more like the same idea repeated over and over without any counter argument. It's far too long for what he has to say according to me. Some points he makes are valid but so far it s lacking auto critic.
Edit : see this link for a more in depth critic
