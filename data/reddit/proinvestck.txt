For you dollar cost averaging is your best bet.  Just buy at regular intervals no matter the price.  You’ll be buying in smaller quantities, not waiting for an ideal time to bet it all.

A lot of funds have mandates they need to stick to.  They can’t just buy crypto Willy nilly.  That’s not to say they have not adjusted mandates or traded with company money but for regulatory purposes there’s a lot of work and prep that goes into it.  Red tape might be the burden to larger funds who have stricter clients.

Invest it with a private equity firm that has funds invested in companies that are being built on top of bitcoin or for whatever the dominant cryptocurrency or system turns out to be.  I would still buy and hold a very small amount of bitcoin but maybe like 2.5-5% of the portfolio if you understand it and are very comfortable with the risk.  If the risks work against you, you will at least understand why they did.

Personally very interested to see the mechanics of this work.

Maybe not too far in the future.  There is a company called Validsoft (I don't work for them, just know they exist and what their product is) which is creating voice biometric security solutions to replace things such as passwords or RSA tokens.  They work by giving a call to any device you're connected to, all you have to say is "authenticate" and it verifies or denies you.  So I would think a wallet service could implement voice biometrics as a security layer.
From my understanding biometrics are currently ranked in this order from best to worst: retina, voice, fingerprint.  Retina systems are a bit more far and in between now.  Voice might be a bit easier to implement and would be quite reliable.
I'd like to see more biometric features coming into bitcoin.  I've seen something called the HYPR Wallet, google this if interested.
But there's probably some R&amp;D costs and implementation costs involved, as with everything, so maybe the security and biometric companies want to see a bit more use of Bitcoin before they start committing more of their own resources to building products for Bitcoin applications.

I was just going to post the same thing.  Just goes to show that there is still a mass misunderstanding in how the whole system works.  Which also goes to show this is still the early days, just as people were wondering what to call the " symbol before email took off.  Email was fascinating... but that " symbol was a silly little thing.  Turns out you couldn't send an email without using that or the internet as we know it.
I think the writers believe someone will create another "blockchain" network that will be more "legitimate."  There are many other blockchain like networks however the Bitcoin network is the 900lb. gorilla in the room.  Many might integrate into blockchain one day.  It would only make sense to be on the biggest most diversified network in order to split resources and security.

I had a similar recent post here that you might find useful: 
A lot of responses were coding base but I'm not a programmer. I majored in finance and use some light very basic coding such ass SQL in Access or VBA in Excel for financial data analysis.  I still see myself being in the financial industry most likely, but possibly at a bank or trading firm, should they decide to do something with bitcoin, I hope to be a relevant source of information at whatever firm I'll be in.  It's still a young space and not a lot of people know what Bitcoin is and/or how it operates and how would a company use it.
I think staying educated by keeping up with the latest developments in the space is key.  Keep tabs on the emerging technologies in the space, especially those dealing with ease of access of consumers and security features such as biometrics.  Attend some bitcoin conferences if possible.  Learn about databases and data analysis/analytics.  If there is a local bitcoin group or meetup, attend that.  
Computer science makes sense if you see yourself being a coder.  Do you want to run a company?  Then you probably want to do business/finance.  You might find a class or two that deal with cryptocurrencies at your school but doubtful.  What I would do is take some initiative and reach out to the head of the comp sci program or go to the dept and talk to some profs or teaching assistants there.  Tell them you're interested in Bitcoin and blockchain and would appreciate their recommendation on what courses could complement this interest.  See what they recommend.

I could see Visa offering an exchange like service where you can charge your bitcoin purchases.  Preserves some business for them.  So you would charge your bitcoin buy, get bitcoin instantly, and do what you need with them.  Better than most current cases where you must wait a few days for bank transfers.  If you use the coins for an immediate purchase, maybe they could integrate some consumer protections or benefits.  Anyone see problems to this?
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:26:41
Kind of inspirational as I'm in investment finance currently but Bitcoin has had my attention since 2013. I think fintech is going to dramatically shake up this industry. What coding languages do you use for working with Bitcoin? I'm exploring to transition to more coding and fintech product knowledge type of work.

For now, most of my everyday household items I buy when I go to Target, Walmart, or Costco and get a good supply of a lot of things.  Costco only accepts Amex, and that is pretty much my preferred card to use everywhere else for rewards.
Bitcoin would be great to buy food and drinks with.  I was just on vacation and decided to talk a walk down a beach boardwalk.  I left my wallet in my hotel as I didn't want to lose it in case I went in the water but did take my phone.  I was getting thirsty half way in and was wishing I could buy something with bitcoin at that time.  Eventually maybe the wearables like iWatch will have bitcoin apps in the future.
I would personally like to use bitcoin more often when buying food, an everyday essential for me.

And by using the smallest units of bitcoin and attaching messages or "contacts" to such transactions and using this as a ways of settlement or transfer of property or rights of use, etc.

Most likely they are not in favor of it as they lose control over money.  However I think they feel it would be worse to try and stop it and then fail and have to accept it rather than just letting it go.  On the other hand a few people do realize the innovation aspects and what it could mean for developing another smart industry that wouldn't rely on cheap labor.  This can be evidenced by new jersey offering tax benefits for NYC based digital currency companies to move across the river.

@_date: 2015-05-17 18:53:52
Well could we really live without banks or other organized sources of funding? I'm thinking about loans for example. Bitcoin is a good solution to the transfer of value and lowering costs there, and automatically executing some types of smart contracts.  But I still feel you will need an entity with capital to loan out and their ability to evaluate your ability to pay it back.
@_date: 2015-05-17 06:05:43
What if a financial institution wanted to work with the blockchain data and analyze it, what do you think would be best in such a situation? SQL?
Or if an accounting firm was verifying transactions and say in the future we can trade stocks, transfer real estate, etc via the blockchain, and people need to reconcile or analyze such data, how do you see them doing this?

@_date: 2015-05-29 03:54:10
Thanks for helping to clear that up.
I currently work for a financial data aggregation company. Like a Mint but more for complex investments, more customizable reporting. The biggest problem we typically have is in the data aggregation process, especially since clients have multiple banks and brokerages. Not every institution currently integrates with "auto data grab"  solutions or exports data in a nice format.  So there's quite a bit of manual and painful data retrieval and normalization work involved.  If data could be grabbed right off the blockchain, sounds like it would be cleaner and more standardized no matter what institution you're with.
For grabbing data off the blockchain and analyzing it, would you know which tools or coding languages would be best for this? Possibly Python or SQL?
@_date: 2015-05-19 03:34:55
What an abrupt ending to that article.
@_date: 2015-05-29 02:37:08
Just to go a little deeper, how would Mint recognize which transactions and holdings are yours? Possibly unique transaction and holdings IDs? The IDs would also somehow need to be generated by the blockchain and be universal across all brokerages as to not risk having two separate brokerages use the same IDs for different transactions.  We would need to tell Mint somehow which IDs to look for.
@_date: 2015-05-28 23:12:34
I'd be very interested in your progress and helping however I can.  I currently live in FFC and work in Stamford so if a few companies could move or start up here I would be thrilled.

Currently mid office/performance analysis so I answer to internal clients like a portfolio manager. External client questions come to me through a client associate.  I've been trying to learn about Bitcoin from an asset mgmt perspective, how hedge funds might use it for trading or simple cash transfers to more quickly fund accounts to begin trading on them.
I've had some exposure to excel vba and just started learning sql and python and I see  those being requested in more quant like job descriptions.  Been told python could be used for blockchain data analysis as well.
I will investigate java as well, thanks for this suggestion
