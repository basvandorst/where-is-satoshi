But you’ve made it dogmatic, it’s not about good vs evil it’s about how people conduct themselves. As you’ve looked at my post history, look at the down votes and responses. I’m not talking about BCH vs BTC.
Let’s take your reply as my example, you don’t agree with me which is 100% okay, but most importantly you sent a respectful reply and because if that I read (and reread) your reply as it deserves that. You didn’t scream shill, or reply with some idiotic reply. It’s an excellent response to a post you disagree with, you struggle to find that quality of response in the other sub.

No, I expressed an opinion (in my bias) and the other commenter disagreed (in their bias). My bias is to the community, not the coin. My reference to dogmatic was BTH vs BTC. Every conversation in both sub has to come down to some battle royale between the two.
I have zero issue with a post saying I believe/love/enjoy this or that because of these reasons. This is a community, not a clinical experiment.

I agree the ETF will drive the price up if/when it is approved and it's one of the key benefits of Bitcoin over other altcoins is the prospect of more institutional investors getting in.
But no asset or commodities price just goes straight up, everything is a cycle and caution should be heeded. I'd rather bitcoin had a steady rise than doubling in price in a single month.
High wealth individuals rarely actively manage their funds, it's not them you need to convince but wealth managers and I don't think they'll jump in until we see a correction (or two).
Remember, prices rising and falling is healthy and normal.

I suspect you're right, but we could see futures instead which although less accessible could be the half way house between nothing and an ETF. Hopefully, that'll then pave the way.

Haha funny you say that, I just pulled the pin on a Ledger Nano S. I'm really impressed how both companies have continued to improve their platforms.
