People who say "Bitcoin will never be replaced because it has name recognition" clearly have never heard of Yahoo, Blockbuster, Pan Am... IBM used to be the term people used before they called computers "PCs". Copiers were "Xerox machines."  
My point is that people can adapt very quickly, and name recognition can be replaced. There is no such thing as "too big to fail." People today think that Google will never die. They're wrong. Maybe not in our lifetimes, but it will go, and when it does, it'll slowly disappear into obscurity while some other brand moves into their place, and people will look back and say "hey, remember when we used to use Google for everything?"

Still wrong, but not *as* wrong. Throw the little bits at your debt. Cut the amount down so that it doesn't grow. You can get a really good exchange rate on the dollar by paying off debt early. *Really, really* good.  
Retirement funds are great, but you can't dip into those if you have an emergency. A standard savings account makes a very small interest, and should be used for an emergency fund. That should be considered "full" when it can cover 4 months of living expenses without aid. Then and only then should you look to the long term investments.

Can confirm, I know a guy in his 30s who is now retired, just sits on tons of bitcoin and day trades other crypto.

 Just... as long as you take the time and crunch the numbers. Nothing bugs me more than when someone throws $1k+ at something without analyzing the investment. That applies to my view on attending college, as well.

No, if you have debt, you should be doing nothing but paying off that debt. There's something called paying towards the "principal". That is, you can pay more than your monthly installment and put that money towards the initial debt. This ripples through and actually cuts your total number of payments down. $1 carries to more than $1 when you pay this way.  
If you have debt and you have expendable income, pay off your debt. Put the extra money on the principal. This is one of the best ways to get a larger value out of your dollars than the actual value. The next best way is if you work at a company that matches 401K/IRA investments. If they match 50% up to the maximum investment, let's say that investment is $1,000 for simplicity, then you literally are getting $500 put into your 401K *by your company*. That money will then grow.  
Long term financial planning is important. Short term is, too. Paying off debt is the best short term investment, better than crypto. There is no risk in it at all. You can sit down and do the math and determine exactly how many months will be cut off of your car payments if you drop $300 towards the principal today. There is no guesswork, no risk, just math. And it's always going to be a positive percentile, usually fairly high. Long term investments are something you can weigh, but *if* your company offers to match your investments, don't let that free cash go to waste. That is, again, a quantifiable immediate gain. If it comes down to putting $1,000 in your IRA or $1,000 into crypto, and someone says that they'll match every dollar you put into the IRA, then the answer should be clear. Once you've made your sure money, then start looking to the more risky money.  
It's worth noting, however, that you can split between long and short term investments. And types of crypto investing can be either/or. But they're always high to moderate risk, so hit your low/no risk investments *first* before looking to the moderate/high risk.

For me, I put $100 in BTC two years ago because I supported the concept. A year later, it had doubled. I though "cool" and withdrew the $200 to help cover holiday expenses (this was January 2017). Last month, I scrolled through Reddit and saw what BTC had hit. I checked on my Coinbase account, only to find it empty, and how stupid of a withdrawal it was. I could have thrown my chair out the window.  
So I put $320 in, spread across BTC, LTC, and ETH. 2 weeks later, my $100 LTC was $350, and the others had gone up as well. I was happy. I pulled $300 back into cash, and took the remaining $300 worth of crypto and moved it into an exchange. I'm now "gambling with the house's money," as even if I lose everything trying to play the game, I have already secured my initial investment.  
To be clear, this was pure dumb luck. I had no clue that LTC was due for a boom. I had an inclination that BTC was about to jump up again, as it had spiked huge and then dipped, and I expected that if I bought the dip, I'd be good long term. I was not thinking of it as a short term investment at all. However, with a little coaching from someone who day trades crypto and makes 1BTC/day as a baseline, I feel confident enough to play the game and go for the short term gains. So far, my choices have been decent. Today, I've taken some bad hits. But I've got a huge spike to ride up tomorrow, so we'll see if I can make it up.  
You're right, it is gambling to an extent. I wouldn't actually drop thousands of dollars into the crypto market unless that was expendable, or if I was trading full time and knew the market well enough that skill/knowledge truly played into it rather than pure luck. I'm getting there.

But when confronted with it, she didn't defend it in that manner. Why? Because she clearly had no idea that what she did could have caused issues.
This was not the result of an informed decision by a person who knew there was a risk in acting outside the bounds of company policy, but choose to cut corners because the risk was minimal. This was the result of someone who was not trained in proper account service protocol and worse yet didn't even understand why those protocols were important.
Not to mention this person was a service representative. *Representative* to me means that they represent the company, thus what they say is what the company says. If she says "use another site" for security, that's the company's official stance on account security, so I'm not touching them with a 20ft. pole.

Points for responding here in an appropriate, well-worded, and enlightening manner. You response should help put your customers at ease.
I have always said that a person or company should not be judged by their mistakes or problems they encounter, but by the way they handle those hurdles.
However, this remains to be an indicator of poor service representative training at the least, even if the company has a system in place to minimize problems that could stem from that.

Even though the site may not be a legit source of news, it is true that the Federal Reserve is privately owned.
When designed, there was a large debate over having a politically run central bank, and the Federal Reserve was a compromise. It is technically a private bank, but it has special privileges and oversight from the government.

It seems ironic that this is being posted on Reddit, a website nearly completely kept online by non-obstructive sidebar ads. A website that fills a good portion of those ads with "thank you's" for not using AdBlock.
I've never used AdBlock, but I might if it had a way you could just hit one button to allow ads on a site you're on. That way I can keep supporting sites I like. My friend gets money whenever I visit his blog because I'm viewing the ads on his site. I would be a massive douche to be blocking his ads. My website uses ad revenue that allows me to keep it up. Ads are great. All those liberals complaining about there not being a "redistribution of wealth" don't get how much money big companies pay to individuals and SMB for ads.
Sure, some companies are going overboard with it, like Pandora and Youtube, but I'm not so arrogant as to bitch about how saturated my free content is with stuff I don't like. It's free for fuck's sake. Who am I to complain about ads in my free shit? I would like to see a paid Youtube option to turn off ads, but I expect it would be an arm and a leg.

Eating up memory is due to caching, which makes it run faster. It's what gives you all those great features like being able to re-open closed tabs and still have all the memory of previous pages for that tab cached.
Note that I have not done extensive testing or anything, but I can tell you that being memory hungry is not a bad thing by default. If web browsing is what you're doing, then it may be worth it. If you're playing a game in one window and have a browser open in another, IE *may* actually be a better option.

I really hate to say it, but that is a compelling argument for Bing. Not just the bitcoin part of it, but the concept all-together makes me want to give Bing a chance to see what their search engine can do.
On the other hand, I remember that Bing is a Microsoft product, thus I wouldn't support it if you put a gun to my head. Having my clients buy Windows and Office is just a necessary evil that I would avoid if there was any good way to do so.
So in closing, my techie curiosity makes me want to try Bing, but my moral obligation not to overrides it. Kinda like being offered cheese cake while on a diet. And you're lactose intolerant. And Al-Qaeda gets a royalty check for every bite you take.

To websites like the one you're on currently that get nearly all of their revenue through ads. Revenue that they use to pay the massive bills associated with a website this size.
Don't like ads? Maybe mandatory paid membership in order to post on Reddit is a better choice? Didn't think so.

I concede to point 1, but point 2 has a quite simple answer: lazyness. The  was left on so we knew that he answered with his email address, and the rest was blurred out because it probably didn't cross his mind that someone could look at that and say, "wow, this email address looks like it's between 7 and 9 characters, I know *exactly* who's email account that is!"
