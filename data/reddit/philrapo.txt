Does Elliptic Vault protect me if I buy something online and the merchant never ships it to me?   My credit card does.    And I get ~3% in rebates via membership rewards using Amex.

Your example does not seem reasonable to me, unless your family's grocer accepts bitcoin.  Wouldn't your family member in France need to convert BTC to EUR (and withdraw it from an exchange) in order to buy groceries this evening?  
I suppose they could go to a localbitcoins meetup to exchange for cash... but that is far from convenient.   


Sorry, I do not mean to seem concrete.  I am genuinely open minded, and I have been a bitcoin enthusiast for several years.  I am interested in this discussion because I find most people are not realistic in how they speak about the uses of bitcoin.

 Credit cards are loans, but they are not subject to interest unless you don't make payments on time.   You're actually getting a series of 1 month interest free loans when you pay your credit card on time.   Another example of how CCs are great value for the consumer.


Paypal is faster, no?  I can buy something on Etsy and pay a foreign merchant with paypal pretty instantly.  


This is a legitimate benefit of using bitcoin.   But I'd think most people wouldn't send money to China without fraud protection... I certainly wouldn't

The obvious uses seem to be:
1. buying illicit things online
2. transactions that require increased anonymity
4. consumer/merchant interactions with regions deemed to be high fraud risk (like selling to someone in Ukraine).  
5.  tipping
what are the other use cases?

1 -Interchange is usually 2-3%.  That's basically the same value as the rewards points given to consumers for using the card.   
So even if it was a 3% merchant discount for payment with bitcoin, it would be a flat value proposition for the consumer, and the consumer is still giving up recourse/fraud protection.  
still seems like worse economics.  
2 -Consumers didn't lose money in the Target breach (not overall, in any case).   Credit cards provide fraud protection.   The Target breach was a liability for Target and for the credit card companies.

Doesnt this suggest that micropayments arent a long term use case for Bitcoin?
