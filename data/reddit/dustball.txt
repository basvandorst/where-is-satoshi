Man, Anathem is one of my favourite novels of the last 100 years.
@_date: 2014-02-01 05:19:36
You got it!

The fan does not run -- at all -- at low power consumption levels.  It is an amazing power supply.
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:46:42
I love it, too!
I just made a video in which I (as a notable point!) declare my satisfaction for the power supply in particular:
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:25:31
1/40 sec
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:02:44
A joke, yes, BUT, who here can actually tell me what is on the other side of that cable?  :D
@_date: 2016-12-05 17:50:32
What do you mean?

Make that 23 customers, $419.16 revenue

I can't find their prices on their website.
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:47:27
In what sense?
@_date: 2016-11-30 01:39:55
Simpler to just give someone a phone number and a link.

Yes, that is the type of customer.  That is how I pitch my similar product, Extra Phone Number: [Google Play Link](
Both Credit Card and Bitcoin are accepted.  The question is really, why NOT Bitcoin, right? :)
But a bitcoin provides better security, too.  Perfect for the extra paranoid among us.

Welcome aboard.  Please PM if you have any issues or have feedback of any kind! :D
@_date: 2016-12-02 01:34:25
Now that you bring it up, I think the best thing to do is remove it from the server when the user clicks 'clear chat'. I should also turn off logging and specify all this in the privacy policy.  Thank you for brining this up.
@_date: 2016-11-30 18:11:14
This will work, just check the 'renew' option and make sure you have enough credits, 100 credits a month for the phone number, which is around $2.50 per month.
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:21:07
Yup, if you click "renew" it will just deduct 100 credits every month.  It's all pre-paid so you do need to make sure you have enough credits in the account.
The app only supports US numbers, but you can use it from anywhere in the world.  
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:40:07
How's this? 
@_date: 2016-11-30 02:30:20
I know people use it to verify other things.  
@_date: 2016-12-01 23:07:28
First sentence is:  "Send &amp; Receive Texts Online with disposable.io"
Does that help?
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:20:02
Look at 
API endpoint: 
Example request: 
Returns JSON
This is how the call is used in app.js:
@_date: 2016-12-01 23:23:05
Use US at the moment.
I'll post here once International support is added:
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:40:53
They can be one time use or repeatedly, can renew or delete at will.
@_date: 2016-12-02 01:40:51
Agreed.  Thank you for commenting.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:43:03
Twilio is providing the lines.
Neither Twilio nor self have any more responsibility than a normal phone carrier, which is none unless reasonable precautions are followed, and compliance with court orders.
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:21:03
For years, I've maintained an Android application that is similar.  
Inspiration for that?
I wanted a disposable phone number for people I met at bars.
Would you mind providing a testimonial? Thanks for your kind words!
@_date: 2016-11-29 22:39:59
If both users use the service, it skips the SMS network entirely, and everything goes over SSL (encrypted).
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:31:21
Yay! May I quote you on that? First name last initial (okay to make it up)?
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:30:34
Yes!  Subject to availability, which works 95% of the time.  
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:22:01
Phone Forwarding: 6 credits per minute 
SMS Forwarding: 10 credits each 
Monthly charge: 100 credits 
Purchase a Phone Number: 100 credits
360 credits $8.99 
1,000 credits	$22.50 
5,400 credits	$99.99

Fixed. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:40:37
Cell is just fine :)

USA. 
Here's my answer for you:
I'm working on a solution that will provide AES encryption, so not even I could read messages. I have formal training in implementing crypto in software.  
How it would work:
When sending a message, optionally specify an encryption passphrase.  Then only a disposable.io user would be able to decrypt it with the same passphrase.  
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:40:18
How about this? 
@_date: 2016-12-02 03:03:15
Yes! Great feedback.  Agreed with all points.  If you have more feedback, please keep it coming, this is good stuff.
@_date: 2016-12-01 23:23:57
Great feedback! Love that you took the type to provide this.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you.
@_date: 2016-12-02 03:07:42
Oh, I thought they were rhetorical! I'll answer them.
Dremhost is my provider for all projects while in the early stage.  Any project that takes off gets it's own EC2 instance. 
Twilio provides the numbers.
I don't know how often they are re-used, BUT, I can tell you that there is always at least a six month delay before reusing a number, sometimes much longer.
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:52:03
See: 
Should entertain your brain :)
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:05:24
Fixed.  Thank you.
@_date: 2016-12-01 23:02:25
Through my payment processor, Stripe.
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:01:46
Where do you see that? Bitcoin is accepted everywhere. 
Oh, just found it.  Fixing.  Thank you.
@_date: 2016-12-01 23:01:39
Fixed, thank you.
