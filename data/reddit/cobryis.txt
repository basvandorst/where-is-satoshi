Is this something LN is capable of now (on the test net) or does this require the additional layer whose whitepaper was posted here a few weeks back?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:03:02
Alright, so I guess what I'm asking is where or how does this  come into play.
@_date: 2014-05-19 03:24:39
Lol, did you just accidentally tip @_date: 2014-03-08 06:34:21
Didn't they already learn a lesson when they lost hundreds or thousands of bitcoin? Pointing out what is now obvious just seems egocentric to me.
@_date: 2014-02-17 16:25:41
Nope. I've never used Mt. Gox. I also wasn't defending Gox. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:00:02
We aren't obligated. The point I was making that posts like these are immature. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:55:57
I don't think this is particularly mature. Every time users say "oh, it's a Magic the Gathering Exchange" or "look at Mark and his gluttony" or "basement dweller", they're not contributing to the discussion in any way useful. Making fun of someone or something isn't going to bring Mt. Gox any closer to its resolution, whatever that may be. Nor is it a reasonable way to pass the time.

I haven't seen tipping like this in some time on Good on you OP!
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:08:08
I think you replied to the wrong guy.

I read a lot of comments like this. They all seem to paint a very black and white picture - that is, we're only here to make money or we are only here because we believe in the currency.
There are likely people who are simply gambling here. They've heard of people doubling or tripling their wealth 'over-night' so to speak, and so they hop on board with the hope that they may be that person in the news who made it big on Bitcoin. Those people are here solely to make money (at least initially).
Then there's someone like myself, and possibly millsdmb, who believes in Bitcoin and yet also is excited by the prospect of making money "off" Bitcoin. I'd suggest, though, that we're making money "on" Bitcoin. We're betting on the technology, not necessarily in a gambling sense, but in the sense that we've found something that really excites us, and we want it to, or believe it will likely, continue for the foreseeable future.
Think of it this way: other hobbies cost money and what you get in return is the fruitation of whatever that hobby entails. This hobby I've developed (which is really solely to follow Bitcoin and cryptocurrency related news) is ultimately about money ("about", not simply "for"). I don't much interest in stocks and other investments. I truly have interest in the way Bitcoin works technologically, financially, and socially. With those in mind, I've come to the conclusion, like many others, that Bitcoin (or potentially some derivative) is likely to succeed, and that success is going to mean an explosion in value (as we've already seen to some extent). 
So, my excitement for Bitcoin is shared in part by an excitement for monetary gain. But again, this isn't the only aspect, and I'm merely trying to describe my stance.

Or because he ate a hat..
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:11:05
And how do we know that this is actually LeBitco1n and not someone that made an account after noticing the post also on bitcointalk?

I didn't plan on watching the whole thing, but now I wish the video hadn't ended. Absolutely brilliant stuff.
@_date: 2014-01-24 06:22:06
Can we get cash back like debit? Seems like it would be possible.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:40:05
I did this back in 2013 when sr was taken down the first time, and bought back in a month later with a 30% less Bitcoin than before because the price was only going up. I've been slowly buying back to what I originally had ever since.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:45:37
Both subs are full of tweets from crypto coin celebs that agree with that sub. Both claim the other's coin is doomed to fail and any major drop in that coin is proof it's failing while for their own coin it's just a great time to buy. And worst of all is the constant demonization of the other side. Shills, twats, delusional, ignorant, corrupt. Very little desire from one side to understand the real people on the other side. I'm not claiming they're exactly equivalent, but it's certainly not ridiculous to find them both intolerably toxic.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:20:28
I've been here for almost 5 years. They aren't that different. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:20:22
I think in this analogy bitcoins horizontal scaling is node creation.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:25:27
He might be referencing Bojack. No idea why.
@_date: 2013-10-09 05:32:31
The 1 doesn't represent a bitcoin, it represents a percentage. You get 100% (x1.0) back + (Opposite pool/ (Your pool + Your Bet)). So you get at the very least 100% back, but then you add to the 1, maybe 1.2. So YourBet*1.2 = your return, which is clearly greater than YourBet.
@_date: 2013-10-16 19:07:06
That's quite the evidence you've gathered.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:46:37
That makes me feel a bit better. I'll save a screenshot just in case.
EDIT: Nvm, it just came through.

Where did my BTC go?
I withdrew a little under an hour ago:
Wed, 17 Apr 2013 21:55:54 GMT	-1.17584000
~~I sent all my BTC to a bitchain.info wallet, and it never showed up. I put the address I sent it to in blockexplorer and there's no unconfirmed transaction. As of right now, it seems my BTC has just disappeared.~~
**EDIT: It just came through in the full amount!**

Hang in there buddy

I just got my RaspberryPi! Thinking of hooking up an FPGA for mining, but also just excited to play around with it. Where did you get that display and how easy is it to set up a display like that?
