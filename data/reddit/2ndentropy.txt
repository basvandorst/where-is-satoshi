Will people stop posting economic articles that don't actually mention bitcoin, this is just regular news, I get it "The next financial crissis is around the corner and bitcoin will be the peoples saviour!"
Give it a fucking rest already this is a **bitcoin** sub not a "Oh look at this! I found some one confirming that we are not deluded and are correctly preparing. Not like all the other brain washed plebs out there."
I am crazy for putting as much into bitcoin as I have, I have lost money, I believe in the dream, I will continue to put money in. I come here to read about bitcoin developments not the impending financial doom of the world.

We know that the federal agents had control of the severs at some point of the investigation but we don't know when. This is highly speculative but isn't it possible that the agents faked the convosation or was it all with PGP verification? If they had the servers did they have the PGP encryption keys? Also why are they not investigating the claim that there was more than one DPR? The whole thing is pretty upsetting. I hope he wins his appeal.

I think the only reason she does this is because in the media using the word "bitcoin" is still taboo, if you want to be taken seriously, especially with the silk road verdit on the minds of the public. Also her financial instruments don't use the value property of bitcoin, she only uses it as a unit of account i.e. coloured coins.

From my understanding two transactions are hashed together and the result recorded then the next two for all the transactions in the block. Two results are then hashed together and so on this is repeated until a merkle tree of hashes is formed with the transactions at the base of the tree and a single final result is found. So does adding transactions increase the hashes required to find a result? If this is the case this must increase the time to come to a final hash that can be compared to the target. Is is conceivable to not include any transactions to increase the number of hashes per second increasing your chances of finding a block?
@_date: 2014-01-19 04:29:43
I doubt this is true. However if it is it is most likely an issue with the entropic value used as the seed in the program used to generate the address. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:26:18
This. These are the types of figures people should be using when talking about why, bitcoin is better than fiat for an individual. Its about the long term benefit for me. For example, I'm never ever getting a pension, all my savings are going into Bitcoin. In my old job the public and private pensions where all being cut and everyone was complaining about how they've just been screwed, that is when I realized that pension schemes are not in the interest of the person putting in the money. Its only in the interest of the people making the trades.

"I'm not involved in that any more"
He might of just bought some bitcoins a while ago and got scared when the FBI started looking at it. So sold them at a meet up or on localbitcoins.com. This would explain the people saying they recognise him from the early days of bitcoin meetups.
This scenario to me fits with all the information in a much more complete way him being the creator of bitcoin.
It is very likely that more than one geek on this planet is called Satoshi Nakamoto that has owned some bitcoin at one point in their lives.
Just my thoughts but I'm biased. I think it is better that we don't know who Satoshi is.
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:04:48
No it doesn't. He has not claimed these coins, no-one has, therefore they can do what they wish.

I think Satoshi destroyed all the coins he ever mined. Every single block he mined assigned the bitcoins to a different address and have never been touched since. 25% sounds about right to me, half of the half that where mined in the first 4 years.

I agree, we have not had a financial crisis (yet) and we have not had a destabilization of exchange rate/money supply (to the extent that digital money has caused it).
Expansion stage is logarithmic and clearly states the problems that we are only just starting to see are money laundering and taxation.


We don't even have the rules/laws/standards yet.
These are the things that are on the governments minds at the moment, bigger problems will arise for them in the future when they lose all control of finance.

Can they really report the death of Bitcoin for the 4th time just because of a price correction. Bitcoin will only die if a major flaw in the code is found, and after 5 years of the best coders in the world experimenting and analyzing it I think that it is very unlikely.

But the cold stroage wallet could be emptied by someone of malicious intent. The point is bitcoin is more secure only if you use it in the correct way, but if it goes wrong there may well be no way to retrieve what is lost or stolen. You have to be more cautious not less.

But each trade on an exchange envokes its own capital gains tax doesn't it?
Off blockchain or on blockchain is intresting to think about. I think that the most likely scenario is that we will have off blockchain services that for things like newspaper subscriptions, Netflix and investment services that will have a fractional reserve system. The percentage of bitcoins they don't have that you have given them effectively gives you a share in that business, if it goes bust you get a percentage of the liquidation. I just can't see every business working on the blockchain. Not to mention what that would do to the block sizes. Heres to hoping we can use the blackchain for everything though.

As bitcoin is a decentralized consensus network, surely we should implement a voting system in the network itself so that everyone in the network has a vote on who represents us as a community.

I choose Bitstamp because I did not like the fact that the guys are anonymous, I'm not sure how good their code is either. But I think it is great that people can be anonymous if they wish, they may prove to be honest actors but things go wrong and I would like to have someone accountable if they do. It may seem pretty draconian but it also seems rational to me.
With everyone moving to bitstamp/BTC-e I'm thinking of moving to kraken as they seem to be very good and are not as much of a target for hackers as they are smaller. Also smaller fees!

As everyone is just giving their opinion I'll actually try and help you come to your own conclusion. you have to start with understanding what bitcoin is and estimating how far you think it will go in the very long term.

No proof that the real satoshi has any bitcoin at all. I personally believe that the creator of bitcoin destroyed every coin they mined i.e. sent the coins of each block to random addresses without ever knowing the private key. Maybe kept one block of coins when it started to take off.

Bitcoin is programmable.  You can still have automatic subscription but they don't control the subscription you do. You pay a month in advance with a program, if they don't see a payment into your account with them, for that month then they don't give you access.
Simple.

They may well be but they are not going to explain very technical details to everyone that emails about an issue. Also if you are telling them there is a problem and say that there is no problem and you are wrong this is likely to infuriate people and make them turn to social media and talk negatively about their business. Obviously no business wants to risk this. Remember "The customer is always right, even when wrong."

I imagine it is multi sig with 3 private keys and two are needed for a transaction. Thus you can keep it a third stored somewhere secure.
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:03:18
Its the same as someone publishing your private keys which are not publicly available. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:05:35
IMO this is secure enough and is how I have been creating my paper wallets. However I can see that when running a venture like this some will expect more security and assurances that the wallet has not been compromised. A possible suggestion, would be to leave the wallet on the SD card for 24 hours or so to ensure that an attacker has not compromised your computer and taken the coins from an address that has just been generated, because if an attacker finds some coins they will have them moved instantly.
Not sure about Mac but on pc the problem with just deleting them from the trash it is only the header for the information that is removed, the information is actually still there. You could get round this by encrypting the folder that the wallets are created in then transferring them on to the SD card. That way once the header is deleted the attacker wont be able to access the keys as the information is encrypted. This is different to 2FA of the keys as when the keys are printed they will not be encrypted.
Love your design, will be looking to buy one soon.

The 1.2 is from my graphics cards which I had already. The miner at the time was more in btc than I will ever make from it which will never be more than 0.6btc (I paid in fiat). At the moment the only reason mining is profitable is because the price keeps going up. Lesson learned in these early stages it is much more profitable to buy in. But i do get the warm fuzzy feeling of securing the network a little. :3

Doesn't this leave you venerable to a ddos attack? If I send you every header that I find to be not within the target you check it while I continue on the block, then providing it takes us about the same time for me to find the next invalid header as you to find out that the previous one I propagated was untrue. You will never find a header before me because I'm one result ahead.
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:50:45

Unfortunately this is due to the English banks deciding not to deal with any bitcoin related business. A bitpay/coinbase business can not exist in the uk as they can't get a bank account. Someone will have to do something very clever to change this. The banks might change their tone but I think that its unlikely. Or government intervention but I don't see that happening... ever.

Could of said the same thing at the start of email or text messaging or steam engine to combustion to turbine, or CRT to LCD, or writing to printing press, the list is endless because worse in this use case is subjective. The current system doesn't work for example, when you pay for something with your debit/credit card and then your card is lost or stolen, you call the bank and they reverse the charge. This is where it fucks up, the merchant is the one that loses out, it is just like them being robbed. They have done nothing wrong they sold an item to a legitimate customer with a legitimate payment. It is either your or your banks security that was compromised. So why should the merchant pay for a mistake that was not theirs? There are endless cases where the system is broken or bent to serve curtain people. Bitcoin is a fairer system, if you are not prepared be part of the change then thats fine, but maybe just maybe you will look back and think "I missed out on a massive opportunity because I got bogged down in the small temporary inconvenience."

They could open a payment channel for your device and pay you for each hash you do, then clear it at the end of each week, this would mean only one transaction is need instead of hundreds. The system you described might be considered an attack on the blockchain by bloating and filling blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-23 11:02:31


They can do that at the moment.


There is a measurable cost to creating large blocks that the rest of the network deems to big, and that is in the form of increased orphan risk.


This process that core has set up categorically rejects any on-chain blocksize increase, so of course the forked code will be done outside of Cores process. BU has it's own process that you can contribute to if you wish.

It's a rhetorical question.
If lower level capacity is not increased hugely (factor of 10-50) no second-layer transaction will be guaranteed because you won't be able to get it on the blockchain. If I gave you a "transaction/IOU" for gold that you could never claim did you ever receive the gold?

I think that 21 will have a database of every devices bitcoin address, each divice will make microtransactions for services and to other devices, all the while 21 is monitoring the blockchain. Then they will use this information to transfer dollars on an internal system to the owner of the device/service i.e. they are not using the value of the bitcoins, only the ledger.
Having the devices mine also ensures that the blockchain continues if the rest of the bitcoin economy fails, it is redundent system that is not dependent on the rest of the industry, this might be why that are getting so much more investment than everyone else.

Its an accounting trick. Cooking the books makes it look like your business is succeeding but it doesn't change the truth.
If everyone uses the old transaction type then you don't get any additional throughput. With a raw block size increase you can actually fit more data in each block.

Quick question though, do you have any clients? If not how far away are you from being able to take your first one? What has to happen / do you have to do?
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:28:18
I am against SegWit for several reasons.
1. This was not a big reason at first but has now become a huge one. Simply, I don't trust core to develop critical features that the network needs pre-emptively. If they were capable of doing this we would not be in the mess we are now. I think the cla ss ic and un lim ited devs have proven themselves with their innovations such as x th in blocks and fl ex tnxs. The former of the two was the inspiration for Cores compact blocks.
2. Segwit would be better as a hard-fork, it would be cleaner to make the witness merkle root part of the merkle root that is in the block header (instead of in an OP_RETURN output of the coinbase transaction)
3. SegWit uses fields for things that they are not designed for, this is both dangerous and inefficient
4. The blocksize should not be centrally controlled and the sooner we can had it off to the ecosystem the better.
5. As a malleability fix, other technologies (fl ex tnxs) seem to do this more succinctly and directly.
6. Feature bloat and complexity of the proposal is dangerous for security, DOA was very complex and there was a vulnerability that maybe only one person was and it was exploited not reported. Complexity is the enemy of security.
7. A diverse set of clients is healthy for bitcoin, if a flaw is in one and takes them down, at least the others are still standing.
I can go on but I think those reasons alone should be enough.
Finally I want to say **I am not against idea of SegWit or LN.** I will not accept them if they are going to be used as a replacement for using the bitcoin blockchain directly because of scaling issues. They have their place but they cannot replace using bitcoin directly.

Exactly he is calculated!
I think he will have destroyed blocks he mined, i.e. never saved the private keys in the first place. That way if bitcoin did eventually succeed he had no ability to retrieve them and mistakenly reveal his identity. Think about how tempting it would have been to cash out when it hit $30, I believe he removed temptation and has only kept a few hundred blocks from the last few months/weeks of his mining days. It is known that all the blocks he mined had different addresses.

From my understanding, your testnet node will have whatever "restrictions" you apply to it in terms of AD and EB. So I would assume from that it is representative of a testnet that is filled with unlimited nodes. I have not looked into it deeply enough to say for sure though.

It doesn't show anything other than, people traversing from one sub to the other. It doesn't say anything about what those people are saying. For example your typical trol would post in both subs and be negative in both. Some people may be positive in one and negative in the other. I would hope (I know it is naive) genuine contributors would try and be positive in both.
An attack of a community is relative to the observer within the community. Some may view an attack as the people at the top having too much power, while others may view people with those views as a hostile rebellion. Your view depends on which side of the fence you sit on but it's the same situation from a different perspective.

I made myself very clear on why that will not work.


* You can't redeem it if you don't have enough money to pay the mining fee and are thus pushed off the chain.
* You can't redeem it if the backlog is a few millions of transactions because everyone else is trying to redeem due to a bankruptcy or something (bank run)
If this trend continues and mining fees become several 10s or 100s of dollars, a lot of people will not be able to redeem their cryptographically guaranteed IOU negating the whole concept of an IOU. There should be no legitimate reason to use an IOU for anything other than a loan/debt. Bitcoin is not a loan or debt, stop trying to make it into one.

I don't understand people who think that it is better to go with bigger pools as they think that they get more with the same equipment. They fail to do the simple maths, you are competing against everyone else in the network including the people in your pool. Therefore the pay out is the same when averaged over time. Satoshi actually mentions it in the white paper when it was written "one cpu, one vote". Being in a bigger pool make no difference to the power of your vote unless a 51% attack is taking place in which case you need to change to the other 49%.

So if I understand this correctly what he is doing is sending bitcoin to a burn address to get his public key in the blockchain. Then he uses the private key to sign an arbitrary message (*the QR code he scanned*), which is transmitted directly to the server. The server checks the public key on the blockchain to verify that you have control of the private key that initially made the payment.

Safest in your opinion. A soft fork can unintentionally create a hard fork. At least a hard fork intentionally creates one, it's just a question of how many it makes.

Without knowing your stance on the debate, either side could be either side based on your description. It's all about perspective, in arguments like this the truth is relative to your sources because its conflated with opinions and lies.
The only truth that remains is that this debate has become a self fulfilling prophecy i.e. contentious hard/soft forks are bad because of X thus the proposed change becomes contentious. X may be true/opinion/lie but X is irrelevant. Convincing some, but not all, via appeal to authority or "facts" splits the community and fulfils the prophecy of it being contentious.

You keep using the word "consensus" who's consensus? And how do they come to it?
Bitcoin is a consensus network the only consensus is what runs the blockchain. Any other "consensus" is not consensus. If the miners don't act selfishly, for each ones own interests then bitcoin will fail.
It's part of the reason the whole block size debate is stupid. If a few miners are unable to process a big block because their bandwidth is too small then they should suffer the consequences. That principle is at the hart of capitalism.

So if you are coinbase and a customer sends money to someone through the blockchain to an address that they have no information of. Will they now only allow you to do this if you provide an identity that is to be associated with that address? What is the point because then when the user has control of them they can move them to any address that there is no I.D. attached to.
Every single one of these regulations is completely ridiculous.

Those are the people it can help most, in the western world you are not taken advantage of like they are in other less fortunate countries. This is also where bitcoin is most valuable as they are the people that are denied access to things most often through one means or another.


We don't know what the costs of running a lightening hub are yet no one's made one so it's impossible to know. Also, the economies of scale the biggest will be the cheapest and become bigger ect. This will generate a few very large operations just like in any industry in existence.


What has a Graph of Memory Prices Decreasing with Time got to do with loans and debt.


It's a step in the direction of making bitcoin one. They did not create a synthetic CDO as soon as they came up with a CDO it was a process that took 30 odd years. Without a strong foundation any technology you build on top of bitcoin will fail along with bitcoin. Focus on making the foundation as strong as possible and you can build an entirely new world on it. Segwit is filling in the cracks in that foundation. We need a long term scaling solution so that we will be able to build out and up. There are several on the table already I've looked at each one and made a choice. Have you?

This is not necessarily true. While it's true that increased merchant adoption increases the money velocity, it also means that someone has started using it which might cancel this effect out. No proof either way.

Ok so everyone knows that you can't kill bitcoin, even a successful 51% attack is unlikely to kill it. **But** you can destroy the confidence in it, bankrupt users and keep it niche. To do this all you really have to do is attack the exchanges hack and DDoS at market critical times being all time highs and yearly lows, dump coins to suppress the price, discredit people that are effective and reputable in the industry.
The most important part of this process to "kill" bitcoin though is to make it seem as though you are trying to help it grow by enforcing favorable regulation and having a hands off approach, all the while strangling it in the shadows.
Its relatively easy to kill something in a spotlight from the shadows.

Yes no one is talking about it now. Yet everyone is making steps towards this scenario, especially if bitcoin is too expensive and slow to move due to mining fees and backlog, then direct access to bitcoin will then be limited to bitcoin banks.

I was expecting a break out either down or up before this current crash and doubt it was hackers dumping. Why?
The long term bear trend was meeting the long term support.
2 days before the hack even started the long term support had failed (03 of Jan, hack occurred on the 4-5 of Jan)
Bitstamp then stopped trading
When they came back online the price spiked to catch up with the current price on other exchanges and over shot probably due to order book being cleared and trading bots.
Then continued its crash.

If it did the value of bitcoin would tend to infinity, not the fiat price the **value**, this is clearly impossible as nothing is infinitely valuable.
Neglecting the fact that I have no idea what the world will look like in 10000 years or how many other worlds we would inhabit by then. If 10000 years is your target for the exponential mean to break and bitcoin has been increasing by 10x each year (current mean growth).
10000 years after its conception and with a growth of 10x year on year would mean just 1 BTC would go from $0.001 to $10^37. This of course neglects inflation of the fiat dollar. That number is 10 Undecillion (I had to look it up) and its about the the square of the total value of the planet... so no the 10x exponential growth can not continue forever.

Well if we are talking about fiat price then it can continue until the dollar is worthless and no one accepts it, at which point we need a new measure, perhaps a better measure is fresh loaves of bread. Exponential value in bread has the same effect as it did with the dollar, it doesn't matter what your measure is in a finite world you cannot have infinite growth.
My conclusion does correlate to my explanation, my explanation needs some extrapolation, but never the less it correlates correctly. My conclusion is that their would be more bitcoins in existence than would be needed, thus an excess supply to demand causing the value to decrease.

If that real is all it is then it is very complex to achieve a very small benefit to on-chain scaling. I stated the primary reason for SegWit is to fix malleability, not scaling thus it should not be sold as a scaling solution with the benefit of fixing malleability.

Because miners are profit seeking.
Say for example you are on the the shorter chain with less 25% of the hash power that you had before the fork, you are now only rewarded around once every 40 mins. The longest chain with the most hash power finds a block once every ~13 mins... the logical economic thing to do is to transfer all your power to the longest chain as quickly as possible so you are not left behind on the shorter chain, and getting a reward that no-one will value. The only indication that you have as to the chain people will use is the one that is growing fastest so you always transfer to the longest chain as fast as possible no matter the client that is creating it.

Would love to see that data...
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:13:28
Because the debates on reddit are never constructive or by experts.
So at the moment fees are calculated based on the size of your transaction however some transactions can be created to be complex so that they take a long time to validate.
There are a number of ways to mitigate this attack vector. One of the most interesting is a transaction complexity measure and fee structure for transactions that are above the standard complexity.
There are legitimate uses for large and complex transactions but the network should not have to handle unnecessarily complex or large txns for the same fee as every other transaction. If the fee is calculated based on complexity and size then it can be tied to the time it takes to validate and propagate limiting both kinds of DDoS attacks to the network.
Transaction type | Exploit | Current fix
Small|Bandwidth|Block Size Limit + Fee
Large|Bandwidth|Block Size Limit + Fee
Complex|Computation Time| Fee??

So 1 billion tnxs per day is ~7,000,000 tnxs per block. Bitcoin currently does 1,800 per block. Or 12,000 per second. To say 12,000 per second is only enough for a single metro area is disingenuous. Visa (a global payment system) only does 56,000 per second. It may not be enough in 40 years but if we were to use bitcoin just like a credit card it's more than enough today.
Edit: I don't math good

The incentive changes because suddenly you can charge a fee for being a counter party.
My question is, how much will these fees be given that fees to put a transaction on the blockchain are already quite high but channels require two on-chain transactions (i.e. double the blockchain fee), then you have the fee for the monitoring service as well. That's a lot of fees. Sounds like this approach will kill a lot of real world money applications to me.

I love this comment so much!!
@_date: 2017-01-25 01:21:35
That is a chicken and egg problem, you can't build community "consensus" without talking about ideas.
Technically the SegWit proposal changes the protocol rules. Where do you draw the line? Who decides what that line is?
You also can't argue that the SegWit proposal in its current form has consensus, it's currently at ~25% adoption and has been for a few months now.
The point is that if you silence one side of the debate you inherently split the community as they must find another place to talk amongst themselves. This is the actual problem we are facing, everyone is in their own bubble and not considering all sides of the debate that **might** add value to the network.


To that end, I think a good solution to this debate maybe to let the people/businesses that run the software and thus pay for the infrastructure decide how much blockspace should cost and how much they should produce. Much like the free market that Bitcoin is supposed to enable. Do you know of a client that does this?

Not true, what do you think a 51% attack is, if +50% of the network agrees with a certain code change that change is implemented.
You will never get a unanimous decision in a group of 200,00+ people that is a fallacy bitcoin makes it so that the majority rules.
In all honesty you have either lost or never had an understanding of what bitcoin was designed to be, Satoshi in the last 2 sentences of the conclusion in his white paper stated (I quote directly from it)


What is described is a democracy, maybe you only think that bitcoin is a "fickle mob" because you listen to the community too much, focus on the code not the opinions of the ones that speak loudest. The code is saying (through block headers) "It's time to change and we are voting for the only option of change we have been given." This is the information you should be using to code changes, not the rampant circlejerk/FUD machine that is and bitcointalk.

Spoofing to blockchain.info only alows you to "double spend" people on blockchain.info and only if you push the transaction directly to them. This requires a custom wallet and is not actually double spending.

No I read and understood, inferring that any fork of the bitcoin protocol is an altcoin is not technically or logically correct, bitcoin XT will take over bitcoin if it has consensus **on the bitcoin protocol**. Altcoins can not and will not ever be able to do this. For example Litecoin is an Altcoin and could never become the bitcoin protocol, if I have bitcoin I do not have litecoin, however if I have bitcoin I can transact either on Bitcoin XT nodes or Bitcoin core nodes. It makes no difference unless I obtained those coins after the fork at which point the longest chain becomes bitcoin and the shortest the alt. Bitcoin XT is not currently anything, it does not exist yet, I can not buy bitcoin XT. You could only refer to bitcoin XT as an alt when it has 75% consensuses at which point it is not an alt it **IS** bitcoin. To sum up bitcoin XT can not be an alt because it does not exist, when is does exist it is bitcoin, there is no alt.
Also saying that is extremely unlikely is misleading, has just as much chance as succeeding as it does not, it depends only on what people want. It would appear that the some of the miners, exchanges, merchants, and the public are willing to accept this fork, but only time will tell.

So if the each block is mined at a rate of 10 mins and difficulty changes are once every 2016 block but an average block discovery time of 40 mins that would mean it would take approx 56 days for the difficulty to adjust instead of 14 day.
I know which chain I would want to mine on if I were a miner.

My only response to that, is that the keynesian experiment has yet to show its conclusion... it is working currently (for some) but shows all the signs of coming to an end. Only time will tell.
Also quite a bit of the austrian school has been backed up by the fall of many economie/empire in the past with the keynesian way of thinking, they didn't know the theory at the time but today but the actions and results are well known.

Dude the UK is soooo much worse. No bank here will give any bitcoin exchange an account so they have to go to mainland Europe, the UK does not have the same payment system as Europe, meaning that every transfer to an exchange is an international one.

Lightning Network.
Smart contacts allow you to open a channel with a merchant and when a specified block number is reached it completes automatically. This way if you use a specific merchant a million times in a month you only push one transaction to the blockchain. All transactions are still in the blockchain, like a public open clearing house, which is exactly what bitcoin is. I don't think it will be a clearing house just for banks and the wealthy, I think that this system will be open source combination of A and B, a cheap settlement protocal for anyone to use.

I can't even imagine what it is going to be like when bitcoin is even bigger than it is now. Its part of the reason I think having a scheduled increase like x2 every 2-4 years with a cap is a good idea. Its not like we can't fork it in the future, if we do it now it will show people that the protocol of an economy (based on a protocol) can be changed successfully, without as much fear.

True, however he is actually doing something and making progress. I am not expecting a finished product that is still just a prototype to be useful to anyone but hardcore devs. The lighting network white paper was the first, this is the second step in the right direction. He is not waiting for the protocol to be ready, the protocol will never be 100% ready as it is always and will always be in development, he is making do with what he has right now and doing a great job. That is how progress works, doing the best that can be done with what is available until you or someone else creates something better.

Only one chain will survive, one might stick around for half a day or so but as the trigger point for xt is 75% of the hashing power if the fork does occur there will only be one outcome.
Having lost 75% of the hashing power bitcoin core will die in a matter of hours. Confirmation times will be too long as the difficulty will be too high for the reduced hash power. XT would have three time the hash power of bitcoin core, conformation times would still be higher than 10 mins maybe 15 mins or so on average, but cores confirmation time will be an average of 40 mins. The longest chain would be XT thus it is the logical choice for users (most secure) and thus the logical choice for miners. If the fork does happen there is only one outcome... **bitcoin core dies in a day and bitcoin forks successfully.**
"XT coins" will become simply bitcoins, when bitcoin has forked in the past the original coins on the original blockchain were been left behind, so to would the "core coin". There is only one winner here and it the one the miners choose.
Again this **only happens if 75% of the miners are using bitcoinXT after January 11th** so still quite some time.

You only to find a single address in the 2.1 x 10^15 with a 50% chance.
The chances are of finding an adress with one atempt are 2.1 x 10^^15 /2^160
4x10^^17/s is the current hash rate
5.7475132e-16 chance of finding one in a second.
50% chance it would take 8.6994146e+14 seconds.
So it is roughly 27585662.7347 years to have a 50% chance of finding a single satoshi.
To be clear that is:
 years
to have a 50% chance of finding one satoshi.
Edit: Calculation error in number of addresses.

Everyone has agreed to a certain set of rules, those rules state that every 210,000 blocks (~4 years) the reward drops 50%. The first level was 50 BTC, next was 25 BTC next is 12.5 BTC. If you extrapolate this you get to a total of 21 million. Most importantly because everyone has agreed to these rules/limit, if a lone someone tries to break them, they will be ignorred until they abide by them.

Sorry if this is incorrect, but could you not create a HD wallet and then have each of the outputs send random amounts to a number of addresses, if you have more than 2 users doing this surely it would be next to impossible to figure out that sudoku puzzle. Also the user still has access to all the funds in one place but not in a way that would reveal themselves on the blockchain to an analyst.
Or have I completely miss understood how HD wallet work.

From my understanding a double-entry ledger is a ledger of credit and debt of a single entity, thus, *double-entry*. A *triple-entry* ledger is one that is for all entities which tracks the debt and credit of all parties involved.

No it doesn't, a double spend is only possible from the person that owns the address with the coins thus if a double spend is to happen it has to be in collusion with a mining pool. This can happen, in which case you are correct, but you can also take risk of a double spend happening away by waiting x number of confirmations before you safely say the transaction took place. Even if that's 60 confirmations (10 hours) this is magnitudes faster, safer and cheaper than the current financial system.
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:47:10


No. There are too many deep-pocketed interests standing ready to throw good money after bad defending the cryptocurrency experiment, thus preventing an outright or dramatic collapse.
Nevertheless, the chances of bitcoin, the most popular of this new breed of self-clearing financial instruments, making it as a mainstream currency are now zero. Prices have been floundering at around $350 a coin for months, escalating losses for those who invested at last year’s $1,200 highs.
Add to this a stream of high-profile scandals over the past year, such as the collapse of Tokyo-based currency exchange Mt Gox in February, and you realise it is not a question of if but when the public loses interest in this experiment entirely. *Izabella Kaminska*
Add that to the obituary pile and *Izabella Kaminska* to the doesn't understand Bitcoin list.

@_date: 2015-03-11 13:48:31
Send colored coins, lets say 500 bits worth $500,000,000, because its such a large real world value you would never accept a 0 conformation transaction as complete the way you would for a coffee. The longer you wait the more secure the transaction.
I pulled 60 confirmations out of my ass, with the justification that its such a large number of confirmations it would inconceivable to think that it could be undone by a double spend.

I think you enter your card details on your phone and apple/samsung send it to your bank to verify it but do not keep a copy of the details. Once the bank has verified, the phone is registered by apple to that account with a reference number, then only the phone can send a transaction over apple pay, just like public and private key encryption. Where as google and paypal have your card details on there system.

The current fiat system has not been in existence for hundreds of years. It has changed many times but has always been fixed to a weight of some precious metal. A free-floating fiat currency is one that is not backed by gold or any other physical commodity. These types of fiat currencies are the ones that have a life expectancy of 27 years. The western world all changed from the fixed fiat system in 1971. At the rate governments are currently printing money I believe the systems time is coming to an end. Maybe the free-floating fiat system would survive if people would stop repeating history. Just because it is unbelievable and unseen by anyone alive today does not mean it can not or will not happen, that is the argument of a child. Do not be so arrogant as to say but its different this time, this time we understand what we are doing.

This is a common belief among financial people (including my sister), however, you can almost immediately see a transaction appear in a wallet. Once it is contained in a block it is considered secure and the more blocks on top the more secure.

If bitcoin want's to compete with visa which can process like 7000 transaction per second and bitcoin can only process 7 per second at the moment with a block size of 1MB. To be able to process the 7000 that visa can we have to increase each block by 1000 times? Which would mean a block size of 1GB. Is this correct and if so how the hell can we cope with that kind of block size. To me it sounds like the blockchain is going to have to be centralized eventually to cope with the 1GB per 10 minuet increase in size. What can we do to increase the number of transaction with out increasing the block size?

I had not considered that by creating a system like this you a coding your morals into it. While respect you for it I think the quickest way to fail is to please everyone. Satoshi understood this and did exactly what you are trying to avoid. Once you have come up with a suitable system for some it can be adapted for the needs of others just like altcoins.

You have said what I have been trying to say for a long time. Have some internet karma. Bitcoin is a choice, we don't need the governments permission to trade with it, end of.

Also non of these people have all their wealth in bitcoin. Imagine if everyone who held bitcoin put everything they had into it. We would probably see a +1000% increase in price and usability. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 00:17:04
I feel you are right.  
However, the amount of people I talk to about it have heard about bitcoin and get its a currency or money but hardly anyone wants to put in the time to understand it, that is left up to the peer review aspect of society. My problem is that when I talk passionately about how bitcoin works and how it has/is/going to change the world for the better and forever I am met with blank faces, confused expressions and then ridicule. People only ridicule because people don't stop to think that something that they don't yet understand could never be useful or have major benefits over any current system. The masses are resistant to change and lazy, only when they see value of bitcoin given as a number do they see value.

I think that is the best newspaper cover that could have been used, it sums up some of the main influencial and long standing stories of our time. The banking and political powers destroying the lives of the common man, these are the things that bitcoin potentially has the power to change. Viva bitcoin!

Can we make syre that BIP0038 is still supported as I have some cold wallets encrypted with that and hope to redeem them in a few years. It would make it infuriating if I could not find a wallet that suppoted that encryption. I'm sure that won't happen but its worth bearing in mind.

Animation. Live action would never work for something like this. It would just seem cheesy. Unless the only thing you showed was a transaction with *NO* piece to camera.

Mozilla have a track record of actually producing good open source software. The Firefox browser was the highest used browser before chrome and is still  Just because something is open source does not mean it doesn't work. Are forgetting that Bitcoin is completely open source it has always been and will always be.

Wild speculation that they used the hardware to mine for extensive periods before shipping. Also we should of seen +40% rises in difficulty in January-May if true, and their was only one at the height of the media frenzy. It makes no business sense what so ever, in business you all ways want repeat customers. Them royally fucking up is a hell of a lot more likely than them maliciously screwing over their customers. Never attribute malice to something that can be explained by incompetence.  
  
What is my experience? I started mining as soon as I heard  about Bitcoin late February, I decided to pre-order and ASIC as that is what everyone was doing. BFL had a track record of delivering products and offered products within my price range so ordered with them. I received mine a few months ago and it has been running continuously since I got it at the speed I ordered. You must remember all of these companies are very new and have to deal with explosive growth and will not perform like bigger companies that you are used to.

Good to know other people have already thought of this, because I don't have the ability to make it and can't wait for the technology behind Bitcoin to completely change the way we live. Being able to tell everyone, that doesn't want to understand because it's only "magic internet money", "I told you so" is something I am very much looking forward too.
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:36:36
True but as we know they are pre-orders and will take time to filter into the network. so will the real question is how long before we see another exponential increase in difficulty? 1-2months?

Too expensive? Just put in however much fiat you were going to. All that changes is you get a little less bitcoin, but at least you get something, better than sticking with the fiat.

Would love to see someone mock up a cover for Satoshi. I think he should get the Nobel prize for economics and the Nobel peace price as they seem to give that way to anyone. Although Satoshi deserves it more than anyone in history as Bitcoin has the potential to stop governments financing wars.

Well I imagine that the charge back rate in this industry is far higher than in any other so the fact that it is irreversible alone will probably be enough of an incentive. Also, even if the price drops 50% it will stabiles then regain the value like it has for the past 3 years. What makes you think they are not being converted straight to fiat via a intermediary anyway?

I'm having the same problem and here is what I'm doing. For Christmas I have deposited 0.1BTC in a paper wallet for each of them with strict instructions to not lose the piece of paper, not sell them, and only when they can be spent in shops around our house should they spend them. Of course I can watch the wallets to see if they do follow the instructions. I'm hopping that by the time that kind of infrastructure is in place that "piece of paper" will be worth quite a bit and should be enough to get them thinking and looking into how to get at the money themselves. Also it gets a conversation going.

The government in Argentina will never allow an exchange to be set up. The only way to get Bitcoins will either be through mining or the black market. Ironically thats why the people of Argentina have the most to gain.
Not sure about Brazil though.

They are not scamming they are slow but they deliver the product that you paid for. Some early failure s are expected and can be repaired. It is not their fault that the difficulty changed. You as the consumer take on the risk of the changing difficulty. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:30:10
Holy hell they have changed their tone in the past couple of weeks. I doubt they understand bitcoin. But now that people in "power" have said they think bitcoin has potential they start to take notice. This is why I don't watch the news anymore and when I do I am very sceptical of everything they are saying. Parrots!
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:38:26
This is true, but even if vendors do not take it you can escape the government forced inflation by holding bitcoin as a store of wealth and trade it P2P. They can never make it illegal to hold bitcoin and even if the USA do they would never be able to take it from you especially if you have a good brain wallet.  
Also the USA is not the world. If bitcoin flourishes in other else where the US will be losing out majorly and eventually have to accept it in some way. China, Russia and Brazil are calling for a new international currency to replace the dollar. I'm not saying its going to be bitcoin but the dollar is falling, and falling badly.

I was thinking the same thing... it's a shame to see him talk of the Bitcoin bubble when I don't think he understands what Bitcoin actually is. Of course then we ridiculed him for what he said and he becomes more entrenched in his opinion. He might just be one of these people that only likes something rare if he can hold it in his hand or use for some other purpose. Like gold even if all the added speculation price is removed he can still sell it to a jeweller. Mitigating his risk at lest a little.

Unless android becomes open source which, I don't see happening, I'm switching to firefox OS which is to be open source. I used to trust these corporations with my information but the more that is exposed the more inclined to open source software I am becoming. I am not great with tech even though everyone I know thinks I am, so I will have to wait until it is out of beta.
I think that soon the puplic will demand that the software is open source. Open Source will become king of software and put the massive software corporations out of business unless they themselves become open source.

And comparatively the volatility has gone down. This is a well known economic phenomenon, the bigger the market cap the less susceptible it is to large buy and sell orders i.e. a decrease in volatility.

Not sure you would have to sell any.

Funny I read that and thought saying that is linking it to illegal activity.

But he wasn't solo mining for a year.  
At 2009-12-31 23:51:57 there where 32,485 blocks mined and 1,624,250 BTC in existence at that time. He was not mining all that time alone, I think it is likely he has just over or under a million and he is most likely a billionaire now.  
His address that he used is on the blockchain so surely it can be found on blockchain.info

Listen saying that as if its fact makes you sound like you you worked for them and have inside knowledge about thier scheming. I work have worked in the design and manufaturing industry and there are 2 things I learnt from both sectors.
1. Nothing ever goes to plan.
2. You can never know when you will finish until you finish.
Yes, it doesn't help that they have an apparently rude customer service, but the people that complain so vocally on reddit and the like are most likely the people that if in the employees postion would also be rude and unhelpful. I have sympathy for them because they are in a shit position because they made some errors. People learn from errors that is how people learn.
