[Serious question] Can someone explain to me what would cause Bitcoin to "fail"? As in, the price crashes, or the "bubble bursts" and doesn't recover?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:01:29
You mean you don't grow yours from a bitcorn plant?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:17
As long as it goes through, I'm happy.

I just sent mine from coinbase to a wallet this morning and it's still pending. How long do you think it could take for the transaction to clear? And is there any chance I could lose my BTC in the process? (sorry, relatively new)
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:32:36
Thank you for breaking that out. Wasn't sure what exactly was going on during the sending process. I see what people mean now about transactions being inconvenient. There's so much room for improvement.

Same. I'm new, and I come here for the informative posts and the news articles, and some funny posts, but do we really need more hodl and buy the dip memes? 
In fact, should we really be giving explicit advice like that? We should all share our knowledge and encourage each other to buy based on their own gut feeling. 
It's great to have a place where we can celebrate/commiserate together, but let's challenge each other to think for themselves.

I've only had it for a couple of weeks now. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:59:37
Sounds like me. My husband and I invested for the first time this week (through Coinbase) for similar reasons. And I have heard about bitcoin throughout the years but just thought, "That'll never catch on." Oops.
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:53:09
This, and also that it's possible Bitcoin may not be the coin that skyrockets. It's likely that it will be, but I don't want to be naive to the fact that another coin could swoop in and surpass it.
Like we saw with Myspace and Facebook. (I know it's not an apples to oranges comparison, but still). 
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:41:42
This is incredibly helpful. My husband and I will be making this decision this week, so we may reach out with additional questions!
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:22:50
Seriously. I've found some great info here, but I'm also mildly terrified to ask beginner questions sometimes. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:21:17
Yes, mostly in Bitcoin. You?

I'm one of those people who doesn't completely understand cryptocurrency, but Im holding onto hope for its future. 
Still, like people who couldn't imagine concrete uses for websites, in struggling to understand the benefits of cryptocurrency. 
For example, I know that fraud is a huge issue for centralized banks. But from what I understand, it is still quite possible for people to hack cryptocurrency wallets and to conduct fraudulent activities. What makes them different?
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:53:00
Thank you for the detailed answer! What about how both of them compare in regards to fraudulent activity/hacks? Do cryptocurrencies have a reduced possibility for fraud/hacking?
And what about privacy? I've heard that cryptocurrency is better because it ensures no institution can follow your transactions and gather your personal info like traditional banking does. What do banks do with personal info that makes this a benefit?
Sorry if my questions are off basis or over-simplified. I'm new to economics and currencies, but am extremely eager to learn. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:35:26
I don't *completely* understand Bitcoin, as in I couldn't teach a class on it, but I'd like to think I know the fundamentals. My husband and I recently invested, but we're doing all of the research on our own and are only putting in what we can afford to lose. I would be terrified to invest through a service that tells me I don't have to fully understand what I'm investing in.
@_date: 2017-09-24 12:12:25
Wow. That's incredible. I'd normally caution someone looking to go all in on bitcoin, but really glad it worked out for you. What price did you buy at originally?
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:33:23
Yeah, it seems that people investing with etoro still won't have to understand the fundamentals of bitcoin which makes them completely reliant on whatever service they're using for investment intel. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:56:20
Going to listen to this during lunch today! Thanks so much for passing it along.
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:59:36
So it sounds like if someone wants to hack your wallet, they have to target you specifically, making it less likely that your account will be compromised. I signed up with Coinbase and use their wallet. I need to move our bitcoin to a separate wallet service, correct?
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:04:49
I'm in Atlanta too and was just wondering the same thing!
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:07:01
Wow. Sounds like with every transaction we make, we're putting ourselves at significant risk for information and monetary theft. I guess that should have been obvious to me, but I never really thought about it before.
