Added Zcash to the Crypto Coffee Index!

according to the API i'm using ( the fastest fee is currently 400 satoshi per byte which is around 0.0682 USD. That's one of the problems of creating crypto-projects, the API's are difficult to find and sometimes incomplete.

I agree.

no not yet, still thinking on how i can add that while keeping the index 'intact'.. and lightning isn't active yet on the mainnet

I can buy a cup of coffee, with Bitcoin, at several places in my street alone. The index of course isn’t about that. It shows the differences in speed and tx-fees between the different coins by presenting it in a ‘real-life’ scenario.

okay, thank you. It's hard to get some clear info sometimes. I've made it 226 bytes again so that makes a fee of 15.21. Hoped BTC would fare better but it does make your points very clear.

Changed LTC fee as well, which is now $0.1132

The difference with gold is that it is actually used to purchase things in retail-shops. In my city almost all shops accept Bitcoin. Not that I would use it for small transactions like that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:03:43
i've changed it accordingly but don't think that's correct because the transaction is only 2.70 USD so how can the fee be 15 USD?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:28:45
Ouch, how/why did you do that?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:10:33
I'll look into the LTC fee but i changed the bitcoin fee, i made it 61 bytes because that's the minimal amount of bytes a transaction can be "It is a transaction that spends an OP_TRUE anyonecanspend output and creates 1 OP_TRUE anyonecanspend output". So that makes a TX Fee of 4.12 currently

i'll add it to my growing list, hope you like it though. Think it could be a useful little index.

good suggestion! Still adding currencies over time, it's takes a bit of work to add one because the API's are all over the place and many are incomplete.

Welcome! Better a small piece of big pie :)
