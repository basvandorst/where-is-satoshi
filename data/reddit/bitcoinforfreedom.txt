Who cares how much for now, this is building network effect. This is what gives value to bitcoin. Thanks OP for converting another store into btc. I often tell stores to accept btc directly and not insta sell because they will only get a few sales per year anyway. But as soon as they start getting more sales they can implement bitpay.

Good point but then we should just have a nag prompt to back up meta data once a month. We need HD wallets though.

Dude why don't you read some stuff about a subject before spreading FUD. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:04:49
Yes but press, for some reason, will publish a billion sensationalist articles on how bitcoin is used for all things bad yet when Western union or somthing is used there is little to nothing out of main stream media.

I like bitcoin  businesses to be profitable so that they have no incentives to get "hacked" and run off with coins but have an incentive to continue auditing, security, and building long term business. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 19:47:54
Yes it it. It is meant to be money for everything. I have been using it for 3 years for everything. Satoshipay has already built out a payment channel tech to send nano txs.

If bitcoin mining stopped, all bitcoin would disappear. If all gold mining stopped then we would still have all the gold that has been mined.

I did by providing a link

No, payment channels fix all of this. Please stop spreading spam

 already uses them.

This is what I often tell people. I want any exchange I use to be profitable! Frankly I do not trust exchanges that offer 0 fee trading and do not do business with them. I would rather pay a little fee and support the exchange than risk another setback for this movement and community. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 19:50:06
I love this! We as a community need to do more of this.

What I don't get is if bitgo works then how do exchanges like bitstamp move funds to cold storage? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:12:05
I'm not sure, I have stayed out of usd and traded only bitcoin and allocated gold because when you put money in a bank it is the banks legal property and they only promise to pay you back. With allocated gold on stays my property held in what's called a bailment contract. Anyway I hope so much that people get as much money back as possible from bitfinex
@_date: 2016-03-25 10:03:49
How do you stop charge back fraud. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 08:57:52
Specifically you?

This is really cool. Well done guys and girls!

If bitcoin miners stopped mining, all the bitcoin ever mined would be gone. If all the gold mines ever stopped mining, all the gold ever mined would still be there. 
Gold has held its value for 3000+ years! Bitcoin 6
I like mixing gold and bitcoin. Gold is an awesome store of value but hard to move, bitcoin is young and volatile but really easy to move around. By using them together like on vaultoro or uphold I feel I have found the perfect money for me. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 20:56:10
Next time use  they take bitcoin
@_date: 2016-03-24 08:47:25
Nothing to do with Expedia and everything to do with coinbase. They should can see that bitcoin moved to the address and at the time before the timer ran out. Focus on coinbase
@_date: 2016-03-24 00:08:19
The only thing bitgold has to do with bitcoin is that it's got bit in its name. You can't even get bitcoin back for your gold and so they are just a gold shop with bitpay insta selling to dollars. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 21:00:56
This is really cool! But What's to stop people cheating with a bot? Or will it turn into prize money for best bot :) 
@_date: 2016-03-24 09:03:48
I hold 35 percent of my savings in gold and can trade it pretty instantly back to bitcoin on vaultoro. Originally I was trading back to USD to hedge the bitcoin volatility but now I go full gold and never touch fiat. 
Once I started trading the bitcoin gold pair I never really looked back to fiat. I can pretty much do everything with btc and i get paid in BTC so Woohoooo hooo I have exited government money fully.
@_date: 2016-03-24 08:54:26
Https://purse.io is really a great way to promote bitcoin with 10% off amazon
Https://Vaultoro.com awsome to have a real market for gold and bitcoin, I never need fiat again. 
And open bazaar, maidsafe, trezor, oh man so many cool services.

IMHO, Bigger blocksize limit would diversify mining out of China a bit to where the internet is faster. Currently the cost of electricity is the main factor but by raising the blocksize, the internet speed would play a bigger role.
PS Everyone should stop mining on these pools immediately. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 09:17:58
Im hopeing that networks like storj and maidsafe will be great places to have thousands of bitcoin nodes but not one machine has to hold a whole 1.
@_date: 2016-06-26 16:19:54
Good point. But you have to start somewhere? I would love to see this modelled over time. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 08:21:38
What! Wow, I have been recommending bread wallet to everyone I intro bitcoin too! Fuck that. I'm never going to recommend bread wallet ever again.

Mass global sticker campaign day so that people start to trust the logo. Companies spend billions on advertising and bitcoin doesn't have a central marketing department. It's up to the community to get the logo into peoples subconscious. A global sticker day campaign would be decentralised, cheap and no one is to blame because it's not a company. 
Controversial slogans like "Fuck central banks" time for plan B, Bitcoin." will get the young kids and  "exit the monopoly with bitcoin" is also softer. There are hundreds of great slogans.  trend for awesome photos and spread the message further. 
The stickers could have qr codes on them where people could donate to stickers that are in the most visible locations. I'm typing while I thinking so the plan is not well thought out but I would definitely take part. 
People could post PDF designs and crowd source the best sticker printers in diferant countries so people could just order. Maybe pick one day a year so it's a day where we as a community put stickers around every city in the world. 
People that don't want to put stickers around could volunteer to print out crowd scored flyers and ask to place them is cafes and things.

Nope. Relativity has nothing to do with relative. I used to think it did too
@_date: 2016-05-26 08:48:34
Hey nice one theymos! I think it would be cool to use your generous donation as prize Money for a global sticker campaign, where the person with the most stickers stuck around their city (proven on Twitter with photos and  wins a couple of bitcoin. It could run once a month. Stickers would help put the logo in people's head. Companies spend millions on building brand recognition through marketing their logo and bitcoin does not have a marketing budget so somthing like this would help a lot. Next time someone asks, do you take bitcoin? they will feel more comfortable with it because subconsciously they have seen the brand. 
The rules would have to be no vandalism and to be respectful. 
We could crowd source diferant designs.
