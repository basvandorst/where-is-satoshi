Fun fact - $60 for a wire transfer is the crazy american price. For example in Poland wire transfers cost $0.30 regardless of the amount if you're in no rush and can wait a day, or $2 if you want them done within 15 minutes. 
Other European countries seem to slowly catch up with this :)

Ok, I may have missed it. So what's the current status? Was the block size increased already? When will it be?
@_date: 2016-04-04 10:39:58
The difference is that in one case you have a protocol that changes, and has a roadmap to becoming independent of miners altogether. In another case you have a protocol that can't settle on even a tiny difference like a block size.
@_date: 2016-04-04 10:36:08
They can't really. 
Two years ago we launched Orisi, and it was a huge pain to have something like 5 of 10 signature-secured address. 
First of all, there was only Eligius, having 5-10% hashrate who accepted transactions that are non-standard. Even though scripts were in theory a part of the protocol, you couldn't really use them.
Once we managed to get it working we had to wait around an hour for the *first* confirmation, until the only pool that accepted it was lucky to find a block.
And that was a crazy simple non-standard tx. If you wanted to put in much more code, it would be impossible to do. That is because the addresses in blockchain don't have a state (internal memory).
All these things that you're seeing are **literally** impossible with bitcoin right now, and implementing them would require a hard fork.
Now look at how many months it took to solve the issue of a block size. And now ask yourself how much longer it would take to implement something more advanced.

At least 2 years ago, when I was trying to do multisig, if you wanted to go above 2 of 3, only one pool would accept such a transaction (Eligius), and above 6 of 11 was literally impossible.
That tricks DAOs are doing with thousands of people doing voting? Literally impossible in bitcoin.
Also, bitcoin contracts can't have state / memory. That means you can't do custom tokens, or you can't do stupid things like ponzi schemes. And you can't do the [unicorn grinder](
@_date: 2016-04-07 00:22:27
You're right about fewer miners not mattering a lot.
As for 1MB - it's not exactly artificial, there are practical limits to it's size. Granted, storage and transmission gets cheaper every year, but still - if bitcoin's popularity grows faster than storage capabilities, we're bound to hit the upper practical limit of block size. And then the fees will have to increase.

If anyone's interested in the practical implementation - the approach from Appendix A is also called by the name of distributed oracles, or bit-thereum. To some extent it was already done by Orisi.org:
@_date: 2014-06-26 07:21:39
Vote 1) raise taxes?
The public says "no!"
Later on, vote 2) raise education spending?
The public says "yes"
A role of a leader is to make unpopular decisions from time to time, and have a clear vision. Without him you'll have a very reactive.
I don't know of you've ever seen projects of above 3-5 people being run in a direct democracy way. (I.e. Voting on every decision). I have and it wasn't pretty
Finally, even pirate ships were indirect democracies. Those guys preffered to choose the best of them to lead, instead of voting on every decision.
You'd think that if indirect democracies were so good, they would be more popular.

not exactly. first of all - most of the running cost is currently the cost of equipment, not electricity. so, once the investment was made into the infrastructure, it costs relatively little to uphold it.
so, the first thing that would happen with the price falling down would be people not investing in new equipment any more, and hashrate levelling off.
then, if the price were to continue fall, the people with most expensive electricity / least effective mining methods, would begin to drop off. because of that, the hash rate would fall down, and only the people with the most power-efficient asics, and cheap/free electricity would remain on the market.
If the price were to continue falling off, down to double, or single digits, only people with "free" electricity would remain. I imagine some kids running asics in their parents' basements, or people who invested in solar power.
The thing is though - thanks to the new tech that was developed during the past year, the network would still probably have a higher hashrate if supported by a bunch of kids with asics, than a year ago by a ton of people who had GPU rigs...
(educated guess, no calculations made)

First of all, you're assuming that general population can't be manipulated.
Second, and more important thing is - general population has no vision, and you need vision to lead properly. Example?
Vote 1. "Do you want to lower taxes?" "Yes!" (taxes get lowered)
Vote 2. "Do you want to spend more on education?" "Yes!" (education spending gets increased, and the country goes bankrupt)
There's a reason why in absolutely vast majority of organisations, regardless of size, you have a leader and don't vote on every decision. Try running a project of 3-5 people, by means of a direct democracy and tell me how it went :)

@_date: 2014-05-08 15:53:44
That's just a matter of indicating clearly which currency will the refunds be processed in.
I think usually it's in dollars converted into BTC. So, you pay 0.015 BTC for a $15 service, when USD/BTC is $1000. Later on, USD/BTC goes to moon, and is $10k. If you want a refund, you only get 0.0015 BTC.
Otherwise it would be too easy to abuse the system. Buy $1000 worth of service for bitcoin. If the price explodes upwards, you get a refund. If the price goes to crapper, you had $1000 worth of service almost for free.

@_date: 2014-03-30 14:09:09
Double digits or single digits. Just 18 months ago the network was working well with the price being in single digits / low double. Since that time there was equipment developed that can achieve 100x the hashrate per unit of electricity.
(e.g. we're seeing 100-1000 Mhash per Joule currently vs. 1-20 Mhash per Joule a year and a half ago -  )
In other words - if the price fell down back to $5, we'd still have a 100 times stronger network than the one we had 1.5 years ago.

"Oops, someone stole my bitcoins and sent it to a mixing service".

In some situations the merchant might not want to accept a non-reversible transaction. So the option for you would be between not getting the product you want, and getting it by using wire transfer (takes long &amp; is expensive in u.s. and int'l), and using bitcoin.
Examples? Getting paid for your work by a person you don't know that well (if you're accepting PayPal, there's a chance a crazy client will do a chargeback within 60 minutes), selling virtual goods (Diablo Gold?), and so on.
Also, there are things like App Store, or Amazon Mechanical Turk, where Apple &amp; Amazon need to hold onto money for weeks/months before paying them to developers/workers. That's because otherwise the risk for fraud would be too high. With Bitcoin, it's possible to set up systems that process the money much more smoothly, and attract more businesses/sellers.
Up until now, because of difficulties with processing credit cards, businesses that required fast non-reversible transactions, couldn't really happen. But that's slowly changing, and will gain speed when Bitcoin gains higher market penetration.
tl;dr; you'll want to pay using a non-reversible fast payment because it will be the only way to access certain goods &amp; services.

@_date: 2014-01-28 22:51:21
The thing is, many people who see the current price keep saying "oh, now it's too high, but once it gets to 400 I'll buy". The problem is that those same people kept complaining that the price was too high back when it was 100 and they wanted to buy in at 50.
Those same people - if the price really gets back to 400 will panic, say something like "well, now Bitcoin is clearly falling down, I shouldn't buy in, once the trend reverses I'll buy back". But as we know - once the trend reverses they'll complain about the price being too high and missing the "bottom".

Check out the article, and the whitepaper:
Smart contracts are contracts that are mediated by blockchain. That is, unless someone breaks Bitcoin, it's impossible to break the contract.
The problem with smart contracts is that they by themselves don't allow for external inputs. So you can create a contract that sends money to the first person who solves an equation, but you can't create a contract that sends money if it's raining in Berlin tomorrow.
And that's where the concept of "oracles" comes in. Oracles deliver external arbitration, and allow for external inputs. But just one oracle can lie, so therefore we need a set of oracles - distributed oracles. And that's what this is all about.

Read up some books about investing. Ideally, you should have a portfolio plan for your finances and decide how much you're willing to put into risky investments (e.g. Bitcoin), how much you want to have available in cash for unexpected events, and how much you'd like to have invested safe and long-term (e.g. property).
Sometimes it's also better to invest in your education really. E.g. if you're very young, $5000 invested into various kinds of education (books on Amazon, travelling, online and offline courses, or even trying your hand at your own business) can easily bring in a thousand-times ROI long-term.
Also, consider what would happen if Bitcoin would collapse to $100 for a year or two or three. Would you *have* to take the money out, or could you wait it out until it's back up? Me, I'm a believer, but I don't have my all money in Bitcoin, because if it falls down temporarily I don't want to be forced to sell.
Finally, ask yourself why you invest. Regardless of bitcoin going up or down, this may be a smart, or a dumb decision. If you're investing by looking at charts, that's dumb imho. If you're investing because you believe there's a target price of XXX which you somehow calculated, then that's a bit smarter imho.

Ok, that makes sense.
Although even if it's good for consumers (bc of ability to trade wallmart/washing/whatev credits), it may not be good for the company.
E.g. the purpose of Wallmart's credits is to keep a customer with the company. If the customer is free to exchange them for money or Target credits, it becomes a simple cashback system.

First of all - sometimes politicians have to make unpopular decisions, with the exception of populists. I'd prefer a decision to go to war be made by 200 or 400 well educated guys, who hopefully understand at least some of the intricacies, than by 300 million people who had 30 minutes to get to know the topic, and are mostly uneducated and easily swayed by propaganda or emotions.
Second of all, strong government helps to bring down mega-conglomerates and monopolies. With weak government corruption becomes rampant, and the ones with money can dictate the terms. Would you like a cure for pneumonia? Well, bad lack, those cures are now $50k/piece, because the medical megacorp bought out all the competitors, figuratively or literally kills all the would-be competitors, and has a monopoly on that. Oh, and your insurer just decided that you cannot work with them, as you're high risk due to your bad genes.
Go watch or read about some cyberpunk dystopias from 90s (snowcrash?). They explain where it's all heading without the government putting a stop to mega-corporations.

Or you'd be saying - "sure, it went from $10 to $17, but it just fell from $400 to $10 within 2 months! I won't put my money in something as risky".
Or "ok. it was $10, now it's been $17 for a month. it clearly is the proper market value. it's not that we're in hole, it's that $1k was a temporary peak"

Well, to be frank - as someone who's also running a saas service - Bitcoin is quite lousy for recurring payments.

Bitcoin has quite a few uses that Dollar in it's current form cannot provide - namely, non-reversible, semi-instant, semi-anonymous transactions.
In the past the demand was provided by Silk Road, in the future - in my opinion - we'll see it taking over PayPal in places where the risk for buyer fraud is significant (buying virtual things?), and also in autonomous corporations (this may be huge).
It's also being used as a payment system in all the new technologies that are based on the blockchain concept, like intelligent contracts, or colored coins.

This is a concept that was described in detail just this last Monday:
We're building a distributed system that can mediate contracts on blockchain. So if you want to create a transaction that sends 1 BTC to satoshi if weather in Berlin is sunny tomorrow, you can do it. And such a transaction doesn't rely on a single server / it's very hard for anyone to take the money and run, or to lose your money due to a server misconfiguration.

Just because the organisation is 501 doesn't mean it legitimately helps people, or is effective. We're on the internet - I assume everyone asking for money is a cheat until proven otherwise.
Having said that - I wasn't the one who called them cheats. I just said that they should provide proofs (i.e. hard data).
Let's say that the list of schools you found somehow matches the criteria. I'd love to see how many of the classrooms still operate today, and I'd like to see the organisation's budget, but let's say I'm partly convinced.. Will send them 0.02 btc as soon as I get back to my wallet :)

Yes, I agree. In case of oracles there's no need to reach 100% consensus. But the case of bitcoin shows that it's actually possible to build software that runs stably with open source software as a single point of failure. Perhaps because it's because the whole community gets to audit the code? Or that bugs get exploited very quickly and by the time serious money depend on the system, the flaws are already gone?
Besides that, we can protect a distributed oracle system by another layer of oracles. After each arbitration, there would be a short period of time for community to cry "faul". If that happened, human arbiters would step into the system, and see if it was really some kind of a bug, or not (a'la what your/ RealityKeys system is doing).
Now is this all perfect? Of course not. In a perfect world we'd like at least three competing implementations, each one running on no more than 50% of nodes. I think that's what nuclear reactors and cosmic probes are running. But such a system would be very expensive to produce and maintain.
In other words - there are various ways to solve the problem of software exploits. One is to create at least three independent implementations, and wait with system publication until they are all well tested. Another one is to have just one - but battle test it as fast as possible. 
And if other people come and implement APIs, it's also great! I think Orisi will trend against that, but that's due do inefficiency of other approaches, not due to our personal preferences. We will not wait for two other implementations of every arbitration kind before launch. You didn't wait either, right? :)
Finally, getting back to the bitcoin &amp; software as spof there. Even if all the oracles are running the same software, it introduces zero new risk kinds into the system. Single software is not a new risk here, it's just a bit more code to audit and battle test.

Nah, I'm saying that it would be hard to recreate that file byte for byte, even if you had the full source code. The code relies on a plenty of libraries and if one of them is in a wrong version, after you compile the code if will most likely differ from the version that's in the store.
As for .app being exactly the same as the one I upload into the store - I don't know that for sure. The dev's signature is still there if I'm not mistaken, but Apple may be adding other files on top of the signed package.

You may want to also review our whitepaper:

It explains the concept of decentralised oracles a bit more. It's possible for oracles to pass on their voting rights to other oracles without explicit permissions.

That's with a huge scale. Also, it ignores the cost of development. The last time I checked you either had to set up your own ASIC production (which is hundreds of thousands of dollars), or buy one from a distributor (which is more than $0.10 :) )
Also, from what I heard, many Chinese miners pay bribes instead of electricity fees, so electricity/running price doesn't matter much to them once they have the farm all set up. I won't search for the source now though.

Alice creates the address using oracles' public keys. You can see an example contract charter here:  - it contains oracles' public keys which are used for the multisig address creation, and oracles' bitcoin addresses used to take fees.


Here's one of the addresses that were used in one of the timelock transactions:
As for the script... I'm away from the production environment, but have an example transaction at hand:

It's a 2 of 4 multisig, and you should be able to extract the script quite easily.


The verdict type / specific verdict is specified by a message that's being sent to the oracles. It doesn't happen on blockchain, because that would usually require too much data.
The additional key is needed right now, because we want each multisig address (for each single transaction) to be unique, and that was the easiest way to accomplish that. That key is used nowhere in code, although in theory it could be used to replace one of the oracles' signatures. This is obviously a temporary solution - right now our priority is to get some of the simplest contracts to work, and then we'll fix it so this key is no longer used (e.g. by adding some random data to ScriptSig, which would have the same effect of creating a new address).
If you're interested in oracles, I highly recommend that you try running a client of the basic timelock transaction (timelock is the "hello world" of our smart contracts):
You may also want to check out the video I made, explaining how timelock works:
The main difference between Orisi implementation, and what we explained in the whitepaper, right now, is that Oracles hold all the keys (aside from that random one), so in theory they can run away with all the money.
The system can be retrofitted to use Bob's signatures as well, without much hassle, but again - our priority is getting the contracts to work now, and securing them later :)

More than 50%? How come?
Imho it will be less. The biggest cost for many miners was buying the hardware - not the electricity. And if that's the case, then it doesn't matter if the reward was halved or not, it will still be profitable for them to mine.
Today, the reward per Th is half of what it was in December (because of the difficulty changes). And yet you don't see miners shutting down en masse.
We also didn't see much change in the network hashpower when Bitcoin crashed from $800 to $200, or from $200 to $50, or any other time. And that had similar consequences to miners.
Finally - but my memory might be flawed here - the hashrate didn't drop during the last reward halving. Any reason it should now?
(And btw - how did you get the expert flair? I haven't been on for a while, and I wonder if i can get one as well. Some form of exam or sth? ;) )
@_date: 2016-03-02 20:00:33

@_date: 2016-01-11 19:25:00
That's not a new thing. What's new is that it's distributed, not that it's trustworthy.
But I guess you're kind of right. If by "trustworthy" you mean "not-counterfit", Bitcoin is the most trustworthy form of money. On the other hand if by "trustworthy" you mean "you can trust that it will be there / will be worth anything tomorrow", then it's no longer necessarily so.
So it's an equivocation fallacy. "Trustworthy" in case of money usually means something else than "trustworthy" in information sources.

@_date: 2017-03-17 21:21:22
From a developer's perspective - try to create a multisig, or a time-locked account. Or anything else that's even slightly more advanced than a most basic address.
In Ethereum you can do it in 1-4h, starting from scratch and understanding nothing about the currency. In Bitcoin, even if know how it works, it will be 2-7 days. And that's assuming it's even possible - e.g. a multisig for 20 people where people vote on what money can be spent is impossible on Bitcoin.
Or stuff like BTCRelay work just one way - from Bitcoin to Ethereum. You can't do it the other way, because Bitcoin's VM just lacks the proper functionality (and that's turing-completness aside).
Things like Lightning would be crazy-simple to implement in Ethereum too.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:46:06
As someone who bought into BTC way back at $5, and is now 80-20 ETH-BTC... On one hand, I'd love more people to move over to Ethereum...
On the other hand, comparing this community and that one - I'm kind of happy some people stayed here. To each their own, I guess :)

Question: how do you know that your device runs that code, or not some other code that only pretends to be it.
And before you say: "you can download the code from device", the question remains: "how do you know you're downloading the code that's actually running, and not a copy of the code stored in memory, whereas actual running code is different"
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:02:03
Well, co a certain extent.
With a better community and leadership, you don't need miner's support. Once merchants &amp; exchanges adopt the new currency, the miners kind of have no choice. 
The best they may try to do is performing a 51% attack (kind of what some did from ETH to ETC for a short period of time). Even this can be mitigated though - a well working community would threaten miners with changing the mining algorithm in case of a persistent 51%.

You'd be surprised. Farmers in Africa use electronic markets to trade their goods. Also they sometimes need to transfer money from one village to the other. Imagine a network of mini-banks which use bitcoins as a method of intra-bank currency exchanges. A farmer goes to a mini-bank, the mini bank exchanges currency into the bitcoins and sends bitcoins to the other end of the country, another mini-bank exchanges bitcoins back into the currency and allows for a withdrawal.
1st world countries have no need for that - we've got ATMs and PayPal, but the 3rd world?

@_date: 2012-08-31 17:34:23
No, I've got a lot invested in the coins right now, and I'm planning to set up a business in the btc-verse.
But the matter of fact is - today the fiat currencies rule the world. They are the "real" currencies which you can use to pay your bills, and to buy the mining equipment.
If there was no way to exchange Dollars for BTC, the whole market for BTC would collapse. Silk road would disappear (dealers need fiat currency to pay for drugs), nobody would buy mining equipment either. BTC would probably hold on along enthusiasts, but it would be a shadow of what it is today. It would become a currency for hobbyists.
Whether we like it or not, BTC depends on exchanges. Screaming "dollars are just paper" won't change a thing.
Why I'm on I'm passionate about bitcoins, but I think spreading rumours about the currency is not the best way to get adopters. Advertise BTC for what it is, not for what it isn't.
@_date: 2012-08-30 21:54:11
Well - if you use BTC as a method of a payment (i.e. you own less than 10-100 BTC at a given moment), not knowing how it works is no problem.
If you trying to build a business on BTC, or speculate - better spend some time getting to understand it.
As for "someone paying to have BTC developed" - it's not a closed protocol. There are many eyes watching every detail of the system, so it's virtually impossible for it to have some kind of a backdoor or whatever.
But yeah, as a computer scientist, I think someone might've time traveled from future and brought us this technology. It's a brilliant piece of work.

Yes, the government may put it's hands on the bank accounts. Don't forget that once you leave eurozone, your government becomes almighty again (right now there are eu institutions that protect you). Hell - it might even turn communist and simply take all your money.
BUT keeping most of your earnings in BTC is unwise. The theft is quite possible, and this is still a young currency. Unless you know what you're doing. I treat BTC as a risky/high-yeild asset. If BTC was to collapse, or I got robbed, it would hurt, but It wouldn't be devastating.
In your case, I'd say - keep it in Euros, but in cash, or in a country outside of euro zone (Switzerland?). That way you can use the funds any time you want, but if Greece goes back to Dachmas, you still can use your money by converting EUR to Dachmas at the price that's convinient to you - you're safe from any disaster (like hyperinflation) that were to happen to your new currency.
If you don't trust EUR, then convert a substantial part of your earnings into dollars, or other currencies. Still - hold it outside of any greek bank. 
Gold/silver - meh. Hard to buy/sell, can be stolen (or confiscated), and personally I believe we're seeing a bubble in their prices.

@_date: 2012-09-04 10:38:54
Some of the aspects of bitcoin economy are simple only because it's still early. The mechanisms that are there in the "old world" were made for a reason.
Example - when mt gox started, it was said that, unlike in real world, transactions will be never rolled back. That was until somebody broke into an account and sold hundreds of thousands coins bringing down the price to $0.002 within minutes.
Currently mt.gox can roll back transactions. It also has other limitations from the traditional systems (in case of a huge crash, the system locks itself down). It grew in complexity.

Well - take a look how much EUR is converted to BTC, compared to USD.
Also, my experience from selling stuff on the internet tells me that Americans spend a lot. It's partly because of the uniform language/market, and partly because of a different culture. But my experience is from iOS apps, so I may be wrong :)

Sorry, no. If U.S. make it illegal, btc will be in serious trouble. With americans making up for most of the purchases, and most of the traffic, the currency will lose a lot of it's appeal for businesses.
And BTC can be made illegal very easily (compared to torrents). You ban bitinstant et al, and that's it. Most people will not bother with wire transfers to MTGox, or otc trade.
@_date: 2012-08-21 14:37:51
I, for one, actually think this is a good deal and will probably invest a couple hundred.
- why this exchange and not the other - more popular one? do you get a part of that 20BTC people get for signing up?:)
- what happens if you raise only a small fraction of the amount - say 1000 BTC. Will you be still selling the shares at the IPO price after the IPO? Aren't you afraid of being stuck with having to deal with dividends for such a small amount?
- what will happen if this exchange collapses? will my shares simply disappear?
- did you notice how BTC prices affect the amount of gambling on the site? During the past months we've seen price of BTC go from $5 to $15, and then back to $10. Did your profits increase, or decrease in that time?

I did it another way - sent an international wire transfer from Poland to the Japanese account in USD. It cost me ~7% in bank fees / conversion ratios, when transferring 4kUSD. Next time I'll probably do it using SEPA just as runeks mentioned.
Imho MTGox is the best way of buying from Europe.
As for keeping your privacy in order, you buy bitcoins on MTGox, then transfer bitcoins to your other wallet out from MTGox. Even if someone finds out that you bought bitcoins, nobody will be able to trace who owns the wallet.

what does it mean "+tip" ?
@_date: 2012-08-29 08:15:46
Yeah, tax evasion I understand. (not that I do it ;)
As for PayPal freezing business accounts, yes there were things like these happening. 90% of my livelihood depends on PayPal not freezing my business account, and - to be frank, I'm terrified of the prospect. 
BUT this is only a problem when you sell stuff. When you pay someone via PayPal, the money is on your account only for a brief period, and it's on the receivers' account only for a brief period as well.
As for not having a credit/debit card or bank account - well, first of all it's only teens &amp; criminals who have a problem with that. Second - to purchase btc you probably need a bank account anyway. In theory you could do it otc, but it's very risky with bigger (&gt;$1k) amounts.
Finally, in most countries it's much easier to get money to/from PayPal, than to/from BTC. In Poland I have to wait a couple of days for my money to arrive in MTGox, and I need to pay for an international wire transfer, and I'll lose because of USD/PLN spread. I need to convert PLN (local currency) to USD to buy more than a couple BTC.
Don't get me wrong. I think payments with BTC are quite useful in some situations, but saying that BTC is the best method of international payment for services is... dishonest? Repeating a lie a thousand times won't make it true. But explaining in detail, and in honesty, what are pros and cons of BTC compared to PayPal can be beneficial to everyone.

what 500k coins? are you sure pirate didn't sell the coins? or do you think he will give them back now?
@_date: 2012-08-31 17:56:32
Who knows... 
I think that in a decade or two we may have a serious problem in the bitcoin system. Say all the 20M bitcoins were mined, but there are only 1-2M bitcoins in use. The rest is either lost, or hogged.
You cannot build an economy on something like this. The risk of some kid finding 1M BTC on a "grandpas' attic" would be too high.
I do not believe that it's possible to build a real economy (say worth $1 trillion), when there are a few individuals who hold 5-10% of the wealth.
We'll see in a couple of years, but I think bitcoin may show us why inflation (not deflation) is beneficial. And we'll solve the problem by either keeping the reward constant (thus the supply infinite, but predictable), or by expiring the coins which were untouched for a while.
@_date: 2012-05-22 14:39:19
There is one more reason, which people didn't mention.
Let's say that in 30 years we suspect that 99% of bitcoins are lost. So, the whole bitcoin market is just 1% of bitcoins produced total.
It is possible, that somebody one day finds a lost wallet on his gradpa's attic. And that wallet contains as much as 1% of the market.
In that scenario, it is possible that one person suddenly starts holding 50% of the Bitcoin market. Obviously, one would have to be stupid to sell it all, but still - this scenario could mean a serious blow to the whole currency.
Fiat currencies don't have this problem - nobody has 1% of all the dolars, and if anybody find old dollars in the attic, they are worth close to nothing because of the inflation. Gold doesn't have this problem, because it would be impossible to store so much gold as to seriously affect gold prices. But Bitcoins? Yeah - 30 years from now, and a situation like this is bound to happen.

Bitcoin is very nice for a few kinds of businesses right now:
- Things that are illegal (drugs)
- Things where your privacy matters (buy btc for cash, spend it online without a trace)
- Setting up business which would require a tremendous amount of red tape otherwise (casinos, stock exchanges, electronic content delivery)
- Doing any kind of an international business where you don't want to deal with reversible transactions, and you don't want to deal with wire services (i.e. Bitcoin is much better to pay for MMRPG items than PayPal, because PayPal can be reversed).
Some people think of Bitcoin like "hey, we'll now stop using PayPal, and banks, and start using Bitcoins". I think that in the future Bitcoins will have their place alongside banks.

I have two more problems:
- investing BTC into a company which then turns BTC into USD. There is a serious currency conversion risk involved (say Bitcoin grows twice in the meantime, it means that ROI will be negative)
- fund like this should be liquidated every year, without a vote necessary (this is how VC funds operate - every couple of years though). This allows everyone to get out of the investment if they want to (otherwise the majority will always say that they want to stay :) )
- ~~~finally, the OP may not realize this, but the business model he described was "used" the first time ever by mr. Ponzi himself (he claimed to be performing "post stamp arbitrage"). So obviously everyone will be asking - is this just a scheme?
I understand why OP may not be willing to share his eBay account (the one he uses to sell things right now) with the general public, but he should show it to some trusted persons in GLBSE.~~~ found a link to the website &amp; eBay profile. never mind. :) **looks legit.**
plus of course verify phone/ID and so on.

Short term it's bad news price-wise. But long term, a person that finds out about crypto because of an ico scam advertisement, and loses money on it, won't be a good user long-term.
It's better if people find out about crypto slower, but from people they know, or by reading about it from a sensible source.

In the article.
"In order for a person to be able to work for any set of individuals in the world, they must either pay high fees to exchange their employer’s fiat currency to their own country’s fiat currency, or they must get paid in a currency that is recognized internationally." [the rest of the article as well]
PayPal fees - 0,5%-2%. MtGox fees - ~1%.
Also the rest of argument. "All the employer needs to do is to get an established currency in hands" - duh, the problem is getting the currency. 
I want to send you PLNs, you want to receive CAD. Looking only at fees/costs, we'll be better off by using PayPal than Bitcoin (as much as I like Bitcoin). This article tries to say it's not true.

(edit, I was wrong:  , inopia is right and SHA-1024 is as effective as SHA-512 )
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if quantum computers are able to solve SHA, changing from 256 to 1024 won't change much. Quantum computers aren't just XX times faster, they change the algorithm complication from exponential to linear. That means SHA-1024 would be just 4x tougher to crack, not that big of a deal.
We'd need to use quantum-safe algorithms of protection.

Ok, you're right when it comes to 403 billionaires :)
As for "printing money". We already have that in BTC. I've "got" 400 BTC in S.DICE shares, but this money is purely virtual. Also, why couldn't MtGox start offering credit one day? I know it's hard to pull off, but if the btc economy will grow, there will be new money created.

How much panic would there have to be for his scheme to pan out? How low the BTCUSD would have to be for him to be able to buy it back?
If he really owns people 500k, even if BTC gets down to $2, the market is too shallow to allow buying that much at that price. Heck - it would be too shallow to buy back even 100kUSD.
Finally, let's not forget that if he was selling the coins, he sold only a small fraction at $15. Most of it he must've been selling at $5 (remember the wall that was there around April?).
It simply doesn't compute.
As for AmberGold - the two things these two had the same were 
- promising extraorbitant roi
- high opacity of action
- paying on time, and then one day stopping payments altogether &amp; delaying payments

Depends where. In Poland there has been a guaranteed delivery of wire transfers between banks within one business day (that is - if you send money after 5pm, you will get it 10am next day at the latest), for $0.30, since at least 10 years.
Novadays you can pay extra, around $1.5, it's instant, and it's always free and instant within the same bank.
Other EU countries caught up to this speed recently. And SEPA (international) transfers take 1-2 days usually.

I think qxcvr is right. The recent price of bitcoin is lower and lower, but this is due do speculation. Long-term though, *if* bitcoin economy doesn't get smaller, bitcoin is bound to gain value. (because for a, say, constant X amount of goods, you'll have only ever decreasing Y of bitcoin)
But the sad thing is that *if*. If the bitcoin economy doesn't get smaller. 
@_date: 2011-10-18 01:33:48
Actually... That whole trading out of Bitcoin.. What people don't realise is that Bitcoin is actually quite a good intermediary currency.  
That is - this is the only tool that could possibly replace banks &amp; paypal as transaction processors. Think not "hoarding", think "software that quickly turns dollars into bitcoin, then sends it over, then converts bitcoin into dollars on the other end"

It's not about a meaning of one word - it's about not reading the docs well enough.
@_date: 2011-07-31 20:59:22
The thing is - imagine that in 30 years from now only 5% of all the possible bitcoins are in circulation. The rest, 95% percent being possibly lost, or hoarded (no way to distuinguish).
That is an equivalent of using dollars as a currency, but not knowing how many there really are - with a possibility that one day one of the accounts gets woken up, and floods the market with currency.
That can't be good.
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:25:10
Hm, fair point. It can still be overcome, but not as easily as I thought.
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:06:42
This is not exactly true. Any function that is hard to compute one way, but easy to perform the other way would be good for PoW.
There are coins that are secured by protein folding computations for example - I'm not sure how good they are, but in principle it's possible for them to be as secure as Bitcoin.
Another way to look at it - for securing PoW you could use any NP-complete problem.
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:06:56


Huh? Hashing functions sometimes get broken, but for certain classes of algorithms we know for sure they will not be.


You switched the argument from "is it possible" to "is it feasible" :) The parent claimed that it's impossible to have a PoW that does anything useful. I refuted that claim.
Whether Bitcoin should do that is a moot question, seeing how much time it took the community to increase the block size (btw was it increased after all? I stopped following the discussions after the first year :D )




You can encode the hash of a block as a graph for the travelling salesman problem. The winning solution is a path that is shorter than an arbitrarily set number.
The difficulty would be either a size of the graph, or the limit of the distance. Finding solution for such problem requires an exponential amount of computations in relationship to the graph size, but verifying the validity of solution can be done instantly.
Obviously, you would need to make sure the graph generated is both useful, and unpredictable (i.e. so miners cannot modify blocks to generate easy to guess graphs), but this is still relatively easy.

And it's back online.
According to the statement - Bitomat, with a new Wallet.dat is now back and running. If I understand correctly - the old funds are inaccessible, but the admin hopes to repay the money, with time. With the site up and running there is a chance of earning back the money lost.
Tomorrow the admin is meeting with a group of people who lost their savings on Bitomat to decide what to do next. So far there were also pledges of support with around 45% of the cash lost.

@_date: 2017-05-24 11:00:27
Once the scaling issues hit, there will be sharding, and using LN-type networks to support cheaper transactions.
Ethereum VM is far easier to program for, so these solutions are very simple to implement. Compared to Bitcoin, which in theory has smart contracts, but only one or two smaller pools accepted non-standard txs the last time I tried. It was taking us ~1-3 hours, with 10x fees, to get a nonstandard transaction published - and that was 2 years before any scaling issues!
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:36:58
Yeah, it's a possibility, and some altcoins faced it already.
But even if mining power drops 4x instantly, it would just take 2 months instead of 2 weeks for things to get back to normal. A bit irritating, but not a huge problem.

You're getting downvoted because saying "just take a simple, open-source algorithm and place it on the transactions themselves" is like saying: "what's the problem with making flying cars? just strap on some wings or add jet engines and that's it."
It's so obvious why this is not so simple, that people don't even want to bother replying.
But don't give up with the ideas! Research more, try to figure out how exactly it works, and get engaged in community (bitcointalk, or on  on IRC) - once your ideas show deep enough understanding of the subject, you'll begin to get treated seriously.
And yeah, someone, one day will make a car with wings, or with a jet engine. And a ton of people will say: "oh, I thought of it first!" Yeah, but there's a huge difference between saying such a broad idea, and implementing it.

@_date: 2015-02-24 21:35:15
Yay, I know. But I never had any fiat currency with them. I didn't buy BTC with them (I transferred BTC to them from an exchange ), I never held USD/EUR with them. So AML doesn't apply and it's pure overeagerness on their side.

@_date: 2015-02-24 22:10:40
That's interesting, thanks. Why then did they say that they ask this only "high volume" users? (even though my volume was not very high). If this document is correct, they should ask everyone for this data.
Besides that, they could've warned the users in advance.
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:16:38
I guess not many people remember MtGox anymore, and their catchphrase: "In 2 weeks", in reply to all the issues...
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:44:26
The thing is that they don't need to apply KYC laws if I don't have any USD/EUR and don't buy BTC through them. Or am I wrong?
Even if they had, they should provide a more detailed explanation within the e-mail (quoting the law?). As far as I understand they have no reasons to ask this kinds of questions to me.
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:11:15
Did you even read the argument I provided?
@_date: 2015-02-25 08:00:08
Yes, they locked the account instantly. The message said that I was unable to complete the transfers until I complete the verifications. But the lady unlocked the transfers after I asked, and said that it was a mistake.

It does seem so. I'd love their initial e-mails to be just as friendly.
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:07:35
I'll add that the volume isn't really that high, and that I'm unable to withdraw any money until I answer those questions.
Oh, and I never bought bitcoin through them - just used them as a semi-hot btc wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:20:27
I don't think there's an organisation that requires such questions to be asked. My bank never asked me what I plan to do with my money.
Also, if I only have BTC with them, I'm quite sure they should be able to figure out a way to get rid of AML requirements altogether - it's not a bank account if I have no fiat money with them.
@_date: 2015-02-25 07:51:16
I like the answer really.
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:56:13
There's a difference between knowing an address people are sending to, and asking them who's the owner of the address, or where they *plan* to send the money to.
It's not their business to know if I plan to spend the money on savings or on hookers (which are legal in my country btw).

But we have the power - if not obligation - to let other people know of the issues that come with the account. E.g. that you will be asked those questions if you use them. Something that I was not made aware of in advance.
If they don't have a clear policy, the community will try to gather and share the knowledge about it via other means.

- My primary use case right now is to transfer the money away from you to another wallet, where I will keep the money as savings.

@_date: 2015-02-24 22:41:14
Exactly this.
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:33:53
Yes, I'm aware of that - I've been doing business with PayPal for years now. What sucks is that they introduced those requirements without a warning, and on accounts that don't hold fiat.
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:41:40
I'm not allowed to withdraw.
The account was almost dormant for the past months. The last withdrawal was ~ 10 BTC and it was over 2 months ago, and I have around $10k in BTC on it right now. There were no significant recent transactions.
I used to have a small few times more. Didn't do many transactions, and didn't buy any bitcoin through them.
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:57:44
That's interesting. Source?
Also, they could've warned their users if that's really the case. Or at least provide why they are forced to to this without a warning.

@_date: 2015-02-24 22:36:02
So it comes back to my original question - who forces them to ask me what I intend to spend Bitcoin on? That's a question that my bank never asked me.
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:33:37
There are a few things:
- when I set up an account, they never warned me that they would have such requirements to take my own money off it
- 
I'm really relaxed about those things - e.g. when bitstamp did a similar thing I was irritated, but I still use them, because they are an exchange and I know that AML forces them to take those steps.
In case of Coinbase, I never touched fiat with them, so there is absolutely no legal reason for them to ask those questions.
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:18:06
No, my government doesn't require my bank to ask me what I plan to do with my own money. Nor where I got the money from.
I had far higher transfers on my bank accounts and nobody ever asked me such questions.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:02:51
Hah, that was my original reason for buying Bitcoin years ago :)
The problem is - let's say that the price jumps 50 percent, you sell, but the price keeps increasing until 100-200 percent. Do you rebuy? How much does it need to dip before you rebuy?
While you cannot lose fiat with your strategy, you are very likely to lose btc (compared to holding) during rapid price increases.

Even if that's the general pattern, you'd need to verify each entry on the "hostile list", to make sure that it was indeed a Bank's fault.
Imho it would be better if the list was called "Banks which had problems when dealing with bitcoin sites" - this doesn't assume that the bank was hostile, and only means that you'd need to be extra cautious when dealing with them (e.g. ask them what was the story with the other guys, and how to avoid it). 
@_date: 2013-09-12 23:05:20
I'm not sure. My guess would be that your wallet app would reject it if it's new enough, and if it would go through, the network would ignore your transaction.

How exactly bitcoiners trading between themselves would influence the price? I get a feeling you may misunderstand the way exchange works.
As for gold - it's been beaten to death. Do you know of *any* situation where gold is being used as a currency? Also, the use for electronics is not high enough to justify the crazy price. I'd rather buy an argument that gold is shiny and nice - that's more likely to influence it's price.
And while Bitcoin system can be replicated (Litecoins) it's not easy, because you need a tremendous network/community effect to get it off the ground. Just because you start your own blockchain, doesn't mean you'll get miner adoption, or merchant adoption.
It's like saying that Facebook can be easily replicated, because it's just a portal software after all.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:23:16

There was no money that changed hands. Before it was the government that handled retirements, through middle men, now it's still the government that will handle the retirements - with no middle men.
It's not like the companies had people's money and somehow invested them. The companies gave that money back to the government anyway. And they provided no guarantees for that money - just took the provision.
For me, the theft was what was happening with the old system. The private entities took away 3-4% of every Pole's retirement fund and gave nothing in return. Fuck that.

MtGox could explain all of this a bit better (for example the fact that setting up a withdrawal 2fa without security center 2fa gives no protection)
on the other hand, you probably *do not want* an automatic enabling of 2fa after adding it. Imagine that you make a mistake while adding the 2fa - if it were automatically enabled, it would lock down your account and cause issues. The way it is today, if you add an authenticator, you can still test whether it works or not.
Also, if you added a 2fa, and the site still doesn't require it, most people would notice. Although MtGox should show a big red warning then...

no, just being offline doesn't guarantee 100% security, unless the wallet's sources are verified by the community.
the risk is that an offline wallet software is "buggy", and only generates wallet out of, say, million possibilities. at a first glance it will look like the wallet is random/depends only on a passphrase, but the attacker will be able to monitor all the million possible addresses and withdraw the money. even if the app was being run on a cold laptop.

It depends on how much btc a given person has, but also how much fiat the person has.
If you earn $50k/yr, then 500 BTC would mean 10 years of life for you and you might want to cash out now. If you hear $500k/yr, then 500 BTC is just a yearly income, you might wait for it to reach $10k/BTC.
Me, personally, I think I'll cash out around 10-20% when it reaches around $7k/BTC, and then keep the rest indifinitely - why turn BTC which is always deflating into a currency which is always inflating?

Personally, I'll use the system which will be easier to manage, and have a better design of the offline tips. I don't really care if the offlinetipbot runs away with a couple of bucks...
Besides, even if your system works like a blockchain.info, it doesn't mean that you can't steal my funds. It would be enough for you to inject a special "stealing" JS into the site one day to run away with all the funds - unless there is somebody who closely watches your site, nobody would notice until all the funds were gone.
Another option would be for you to introduce a bug in the offline wallet generation js, so it only generates addresses out of the list of a couple million possible combinations. Again - nobody would probably notice until too late.
tl;dr; it's not the architecture which gives the security, it's the trustworthiness of the founders. Knowing you by name would instill more trust for you in me, than a client-encrypted wallet.
Having said all that, I think yours is a nice project. I can imagine a future with some kind of a js-encrypted wallet framework to be used by websites. That would be cool :)

That's what I'm saying. Better services cannot overthrow the monopolies because the cost would be too high. So we're ending up with subpar services.
Also, that's where the government would be really useful. The anti-trust committee could force Craigslist to open-source their classifieds, and the classified ad services would compete based on the ease of use and other value added.
The free market could do it's work again, and we'd finally see some better sites.
Another case - this time when it comes to oligopolies in Europe. The cities are filled with cell-phone operator transmitters. If a new operator wanted to deliver a better quality service, he would be unable to do so, as it's impossible to put up new transmitters in many areas, and the current operators are not willing to cooperate with an upstart competition.
The effect is that citizens lose, because they have a lousy cell phone carriers with no hope for a new company coming in, and the only chance for a breakup of the status quo is in government intervention.
One more? Railroad networks. There can be only so much rail in the cities, and - if not for government's regulations - the first company to enter a given city might dominate the market. I.e. build their own railway, and only allow their train service to operate. No matter how shitty the service, the citizens would need to use it, because it would still be better than buses or cars. And the railway operator would have no incentive to improve their trains.
That's why in quite a few countries the government broke down such companies into different entities - one entity handles tracks, and another one handles trains. Thanks to this, the company which delivers the best train service wins the citizens.
And so on, and so forth. You can also read up about the game theory and how it relates to economics. In short - there are situations in which all the actors acting up in their best interest cause everyone to lose, while a different - forced - strategy would be better for everyone involved.

You know, I honestly don't care whether you believe or not in god, or anything else.
The problem is when a prick like OP comes to my home and tells me that I should or should not be doing something, because he believes there exists an invisible being that wouldn't like that.
Finally, you - even if you are a Christian - you should be angry at OP as just as I am. There are quite a few smart parts in this religion, and one of them is that nobody should mention the god's name in vain.
So while I'm screaming at this guy "god doesn't exist, so your argument is invalid", you should join me and scream "don't sin by claiming you know what God wants!"
And if that didn't convince you, have some money.

I believe the government is necessary because sometimes it has to make an unpopular decision (and live up to consequences if those decisions don't work out).
I prefer to choose a good leader, with a vision, elected once every couple of years than to have a committee decide  every single decision.
And no - the law is not forced upon anybody. The borders are open and if someone doesn't like it, he/she can leave. Over a million Poles left the country since we joined EU. Also, the ruling party is on it's second term, and the current polls indicate that it will be reelected.


Well, the current ruling party tries to change it bit by bit. They increased the retirement age, and they want to lower the costs of the whole system. There is a lot of unpopular decisions that they're making, decisions which would not be possible in direct democracy.
Personally, I believe that government should provide a backup to all the people who failed at life. The sick guy at age of 87 without family? Letting him die on streets would be uncivilised. Or somebody who lost literally everything due to a long illness? We should help him get back on his feet.
But giving retirements to people who are still able to work, just because they reached a certain age? Especially when we live longer and longer? That's stupid.
@_date: 2013-06-03 09:01:16

Why is the board space a precious commodity here? I'd think that the cost of adding an extra MCU to the board is minimal compared to the cost of asics. I mean - the board itself will cost them like $100-$300, while asics will cost them $1000 / each (assuming a run of like 1000-2000)
Second thing, this is not a regular commercial good. It's a small run commercial good. A cost of designing &amp; redesigning is nontrivial in this case, also there is a time sensitivity, as the competition is right behind them. An extra month of delay could break their business, an extra chip onboard wouldn't.

just two more questions:
- did I properly notice that you allow only to verify the software on the chip, not put my own in there? if that's so, in theory you could wire it so, that the uC would fake the software test. the analysis of the board would reveal it, but still - I'd prefer to be able to upload my own software, just to be 100% sure.
- there is a standard for two-factor private key generation. if you included that, and put a constant somewhere at the beginning of the code, even if someone was to discover a vulnerability in your random number generation, the keys would be protected with the additional code specific to every single user who bothered to set it up.

.I don't want a world where I need to carry my own gun and hire my own security to walk on streets safely. I also don't want to have paid roads everywhere and cities split into locked off comunes - each with it's own rules, regulations and so on.
I cheered when my country joined European Union, because a pan-continental government can afford better support for it's citizens. And if I dislike my own government, there is one more level above it now, which can keep it sane. As opposed to a world full of small communes each with it's own power struggles and/or small dictatorship.
I also don't want to live in a world of mega-corporations, I prefer to have a government which helps to split them and forces them to obey laws that are beneficent to it's citizens. 
Even if that means that I have to give away some freedoms.

NYSE - my bet is that their systems are archaic, and I think the trading gets done through trusted partners - ddosing their website wouldn't halt the trades. I think MPEX.co handles DDOSes in a similar way.
Another factor is that people have way much more confidence in NYSE, so a DDOS probably wouldn't bring in the prices of market down 50%.

And also, when a business withdraws funds, it needs to be to the bank account of the same name as the PayPal registration.
Hence, if I pay through PayPal, I can be reasonably sure the receiver's name is in fact what he/she claims it to be. Not that I would care too much with the chargeback option.

Thanks for the explanation behind your definition.
As for your argument - there are situations where simple rules of supply and demand don't apply. That's why we have anti-dumping laws.
Say, I'm the only producer of a gizmo. I'm an extremely wealthy company, and also - setting a production line for the gizmo is quite expensive.
I can now charge an extraordinary margin, and not be afraid of someone else jumping in. Why? Because if someone would dare to invest the capital into production lines, I can lower the price of a gizmo temporarily to below the point of profitability. And keep it that way until the other company goes bankrupt.
Obviously, the new startups are smart, and won't even try to set up a competing line of gizmo production, because they know it's impossible to win. And I won't ever have to really lower my prices.
Perhaps I can't charge a billion dollars, but if the gizmo is something that people really need (like Internet? or health services?) I can charge quite a large premium, as the demand is not that elastic.

Well, your explanation is a bit closer to truth, but it's also an approximation, because in theory you sometimes don't need to pay VAT if you exchange Bitcoins on exchanges outside of Europe who didn't meet certain volume, and aren't registered VAT payees.
But the conclusion is simiar:
- paying in Eur in Germany = X% VAT
- paying in Btc in Germany = X% VAT (while rest of Europe it's 2*X% VAT, with a few caveats)
And also, a lot less pain with paperwork for the vendors.

Faster confirmations mean that you just have to wait for more confirmations to be sure there is no double spending. A lack of asic mining doesn't give it any value.

,You missed my point. I don't know what possible use cases for alternative cryptocurrencies can there be, but the idea is that not all alt-currency changes can be ported back into Bitcoin.
Just like Bitcoin beats PayPal not by providing a better overall service, but by catering to a different market altogether. There's no way PayPal will improve itself to match Bitcoin's benefits.
As for your argument against the solutions I proposed... It's a different discussion altogether, but I'll take a bite.
As for the central services being suspectible to shutdown - yes, but it may be a tradeoff that's worth taking in some situations. There can also be semi-distributed services, where there's 10 servers running the business, and a small anonymous community of admins handling everything. It wouldn't have the bitcoin's stability, nor transparency, but it might have other features - like instant confirmations (bc. no blockchain), or better/easier APIs, or even a possible transaction rollback in case of a huge theft.
As for dollar parity - that's a big thing. You may like the speculation aspect of the currency, but there are quite a few people who want to use it for payments, and who would prefer to have a dollar parity.
But, I'll say it again, the crux of the argument is not the details of the possible alt-currencies. It's the fact that it's possible to compete with Bitcoin without blockchain. Go read "Innovator's Dillema", or "Blue Ocean Strategy" books, because that's like 101 of the distruptive business.

Well, to be frank - if an alternate cryptocurrency emergens, which has no blockchain but some other features, it might take away market from Bitcoin.
Imagine that three new cryptocurrencies appear:
- one of them provides total anonymity at the expense of transaction speed
- one of them provides super-fast transaction speed, but relies on a bunch of central servers which somehow didn't get shut down by government
- one of them provides one to one dollar parity, but to accomplish this, there are various aml regulations required.
Bitcoin wouldn't incorporate any of those features, because it would mean having to take some tradeoffs we're (as a community) not willing to take. But each single currency would take away a significant portion of the market - if not 100%.

The math doesn't add up.
Say, I want to raise 1000 BTC on IPO, by giving away 1000 shares, 1 BTC each. If I want to do that on MPEX, I'd do just that.
But, if instead of an exchange I'd like to use colored coins, and make 1 share equal 1 colored btc, I'd need to sell 1 colored btc for 2 non-colored (because at the end of IPO I need to have 1000 extra BTC).
So, now, each colored BTC I issued is worth 2 BTC. People begin trading, and the price of this coin goes up to 2.5 BTC, ok?
Now, imagine my company going under. The shares are worthless. Each colored BTC is now worth just 1 BTC, compared to 2.5 BTC before the collapse. All the extra value evaporates.
By comparison, on MPEX the shares would be worth 1.5 BTC each, and their value would drop to 0. In either case people would lose just as much money.
The colored coins make sense for IPOs, because allow shares to be separated from any single exchange. But won't protect your investment in case of a company default. It's like saying that you prefer to have your regular stock shares printed on paper, because if a company defaults, at least you can use the paper to take notes or recycle...

Mobile wallets are quite secure (less viruses on phones, and none on iOS), paper wallets are very secure, also coinbase or any other cloud wallet which uses 2 factor authentication for withdrawals (read: *doesn't* use client-side encryption, but has other methods to deal with stuff), finally - so far Mac OS is also quite secure.
I imagine that in future most people will have a small amount of money in Bitcoin (like $10-$50), which they will keep in a moderately secure, but convenient place (I tell my friends to use Coinbase, Blockchain, or the blockchain app, which are easy to set up)
And some people will have bitcoin savings kept in a complex-but-very-secure spot - like a hardware wallet, or a paper/offline/brain wallet. The complex-but-very-secure solution is hard to maintain, but then if you have more than a couple grand in btc, it's worth it.

It's versus because currency's strength grows exponentially with amount of users. In other words:
the usefulness of currency a + usefulness of currency b &lt; usefulness if just a had the whole market
There are at least two reasons for that:
- either everyone has to keep two separate wallets (which adds another layer of irritation to users), or each merchant has to implement two payment systems (which slows the adopotion of either one)
- if there are two currencies, the trade volume is lower for each of them, and this increases volatility
There are other reasons as well if you think about it. The only people who really benefit from Litecoin are the early adopters. Everyone else loses, and the "success" of litecoin puts in jeopardy the whole cryptocurrency movement. Did you ever hear about "divide and conquer"? That's what's happening here.

Government exchanged one promise for another - arguably equally valid - promise. Until the government says "we're not paying out", you cannot say there's bankruptcy.
It would be different if those bonds were held on private accounts which people could access at any time. But that's not happened. I didn't have access to my retirement money before, I don't have an access now. I was promised a retirement before, based on how much I pay in, I'm still promised that.
I didn't have a choice to give or not to give this money to government before, and I don't have it now.
The middlemen didn't guarantee the safety of my money before, they don't guarantee it now.
The only thing that changed is that now no corporation takes 4% off the money that I give to the government. And no corporation takes 0.05% of my retirement "funds" every month.

Bitcoin offers many more possibilities where the traditional banking solutions fail. It won't just get boring, because for some things there is simply no alternative.
To some extend it's like asking "won't people just get bored with the whole Internet thing and just stop using it?". Nah, it's too useful.

Some of the arguments are not idiotic at all.
1. gpu mining indeed uses the graphic card fast
2. you only process data that was already public
3. well, that's a point. why would he *work* if he can live off his parents?
4. NSA watches everybody. No risk no gain.
5. This sometimes happens (when people try to sell bitcoin via PayPal), but you can sell via exchanges which - aside from MtGox - really do pay.
But all in all, that's the thing about entrepreneurship. Some people just don't like the risks, and they prefer the comfort to their homes.
You can explain that bitcoin mining is an adventure (Hobbit?:) ), and they can either stay at home and do nothing, or they can do fun stuff. And yeah - fun stuff is dangerous, but that's what makes it exciting, and that's how you make really good money.
You can also read up some biographies - for example Branson's "Screw it let's do it.", or [How to be a Billionaire]( It will give you arguments by saying "hey, Warren Buffet was doing similar things, just with different technology".
But all in all, that's what society is. You'll probably be better off finding people who are already entrepreneurs and miners, than converting your friends to becoming ones. My mentor years ago told me that his biggest waste of time was kicking lazy people in the asses, whilst his biggest discovery that he should just find adventurous people and do stuff with them / show them the way.

Another solution, although not perfect, is simply switching to incognito mode in your Chrome browse before accessing bitcoins - that will turn off your plugins and eliminate the most common source of breakins.
Another thing - that's what I do - is to have a "savings" account I access only on an uber-secure computer, and a "purse" which contains 1-3 BTC, that is a Blockchain app in iPhone.

Take a look at bitcoins days destroyed, and at the transactions excluding popular addresses.
If you look at plain transaction count, gambling sites like Satoshi Dice disturb the view, as those sites have a tremendous transaction count.
Also, the transactions alone are not a good metric, because they count automatic transactions forwarding coins from one address to another. That's why bitcoin days destroyed is better.

Because it's not exactly true. Nothing was confiscated, just moved from private-handled accounts to the government-handled accounts.
It's a complicated issue, and our retirement system for the past years (imho) was a huge scam draining money from public &amp; private accounts into big corporations. We're straightening it out (again, in my opinion, a plenty of people in Poland would not agree), and it's good for everyone - aside from the corporate moguls.

You should also be sure that the app you generated the offline wallet with is legit (i.e. is one of the respected apps)
Imagine that you download an app from an untrusted source. Even if the computer you use it on is offline, the app could simply be rigged to generate a wallet from a limited set of seeds.
This way, the attacker would not know which walled you generated, but could watch all the, say, 5000 addresses that may be generated off the app.
In other words - make sure that you download a trusted app from a trusted source.

it's only worth $133 if it's possible to cash out those $133.
MtGox **has** liquidity problems. Even if a couple people managed to cash out, there is still a plenty of evidence most didn't. Even MtGox doesn't hide it - look at their recent press release, and also think - wouldn't they announce it if they finally went through the backlog of withdrawals?
I followed a disappearance of a big (polish AmberGold - $50M) pyramid scheme once... They made withdrawals from time to time to some people, so everyone had hope. Also, they had perfectly legit reasons for problems with withdrawals (government causing them problems)... It looked quite similar to what we're seeing with MtGox.
I may be wrong, but in case of PirateAt40, the scenario also looked similar. It's not like the payments stopped one moment, some people still got their money, just very very few.
Now, I don't say MtGox is a pyramid scheme. Compared to most pyramid schemes, they've got quite a reasonable business model and math adds up. I also - honestly - cheer for them. But still - their recent opacity, and the problems with withdrawals, this looks exactly like a company bound for insolvency.
And also - unfortunately - if MtGox goes down, so does a value of Bitcoin. I don't want to see that happen (got some serious money in Bitcoin right now), but if it happens - I've got cash reserves :)
Finally. Regardless of how much we like people at MtGox (and I really do), saying that they're a stable business and estimating BTC value off their ticker just because some people got withdrawals is ... irresponsible? 
Once MtGox clears up the backlog, improves their transparency, and - hopefully - shows some financials, I'll be ready to endorse them once again.

Half positive, half negative imo.
A lot of rambling about deanonymizing bitcoin and adding customer protection ( chargebacks? ), a banker trying to bring down bitcoin to just faster transactions ( I bet so he can later say, we don't need bitcoin, because faster wire transfers will accomplish the same thing).
On the other hand - the Fincen lady said some smart things - just like yesterday. I hope she didn't see or get offended by memes (positive but creepy) with her quotes from yesterday floating around. Both sides repeated that bitcoin is good for innovation, and that it is used for good purposes as well ( as opposed to liberty reserve which was mkstly used for miney laundering ). People also talked about how bad regulations can drive businesses away from us, and how they already did did ( exchanges ).
What i think would be nice if the talk about regulation switched from talking about dangers, and into the talk about how tot ax the damn thing, and how can small innovative businesses like bittipbot operate freely within the framework.
The lady-senator went that way - she asked that if she sells a cake, how does she ring up bitcoin on a cash register. That's what i also wiuld like to know.
All in all, mixed feelings. Two or three people on the panel I absolutely hated for their cluelessness, the rest were quite positive. It's good to know that there are bright people in the government after all, and good too see u.s. Talking not just about threats, but about facilitating innovation as well.

There is a difference between government control / surveillance, and government recognition, and adjusting the existing laws to new technology.
As a business owner for example, there is no way I'll open an exchange if there is a risk that after the 4 years government will say I had to pay 22% VAT tax off every million bitcoins I traded on the exchange.
That's why statements like this in Korea, and earlier in Germany are important. Right now if I'm in Germany, I can run business without much fear. In countries where government didn't yet speak it's opinion, I wouldn't want to touch btc.

Aside from this, my two arguments which still hold true:
- BTC has huge potential besides illicit trades
- Even if not, there will be a plenty of other sites taking over after Silk Road. It's Napster all over again :)

Similarily, S.DICE bought on IPO @ 0.032, with BTC being around $10 at the time, and sold at the peak of BTC price, at $25 would give you around 3000% ROI. It's nothing compared to 80k% ROI of LTC-Global, but still..

at least this was my argument for selling a part of btc - if i sell say 20% of coins for $100k, and the crash comes, I still have 100k which I can use comfortably without work for the next 6 years in my country. and if the crash doesn't come, i'll have a million instead of a million and 200. a difference indeed, but not life altering.

you should read up on how the bitcoin protocol works - some of the stuff you mentioned is impossible (you cannot send Ƀ over bluetooth, you need internet access), and some of the stuff is being already done - atms, mobile systems and so on

@_date: 2013-03-28 22:34:17
Ok, that's important for me to know that the people who handle critical stuff have enough money to be well off themselves, and to hire a pro security staff.
I worked in a couple non-profits, and I know that there is only so much most people can do before you burn out and need to switch to something that pays. Usually it's 1-2 years...
In case of BTC exchange, if founders get slacking, it means worse security, or a risk of someone running away with money.
Also, once you reach the scale, you need enough money to handle legal stuff, etc. I want you to earn enough to pay for top lawyers and accountants, I want you to hire the best support possible, etc. So I know my money is safe.
I also want you to have a buffer for when someone steals some of the users' money, to be able to refund them.
But if you take fees on withdrawal, etc, that's all good.
Oh, and one more thing - I didn't find details on your security. Where do you keep bitcoins - do you have a cold storage? The history suggests that without cold storage someone will break into your system. I wouldn't hold  any serious bitcoins in a place with no cold storage (like mtgox, or mpoe), or client-side encryption (like Blockchain.info - although that model won't work for the exchange :) ).
If you don't have that, I can give you a try and keep 1-5BTC, but I won't keep more than my daily pay there.
@_date: 2013-12-23 10:28:36
from what i understand they use client-side encryption, right?
if so, then it's essentially what blockchain.info does (and "bounty" for hacking them goes into tens of millions dollars), and yes, indeed, they are considered the safest storage for bitcoins.
having said that, having data encrypted securely is just a part of the solution. for example, the attacker might put a malicious script on the wallet website login screen and extract passwords from it. or the attacker might attack your private computer holding the cloud keys. or even physically attack the servers - for $25k perhaps not, but for $10M - why not.
in other words - it's not that difficult to build a "safe" that will withstand an attack. the hard part is making sure that nobody steals the keys to the safe from your pocket, and doesn't look over your shoulder when you type in the pin. also, no bounty guarantees against a backdoor left by the safe builder.
tl;dr; "cloud encryption" is really nothing new. that's not where the problem lies.

It's because openly fighting the government wouldn't do bitcoin any good.
I'm planning a Bitcoin venture, and if it was openly fought by the government, I think I wouldn't go for it.
Can government stop Bitcoin? I honestly believe it can't. But it can slow it down tremendously - just like it blocks weed and other things that don't really hurt anyone.
In my opinion, *especially* when you believe that Bitcoin is on a collision with government, you should stay silent and hope that the government won't notice this until it's too late. You can have either a bloody, 20-year battle for supremacy, or a semi-peaceful coexistence until the day comes that everyone uses Bitcoin and people forget about Dollar. I would prefer the latter. It's faster, and better.

This is a decent argument. I think one of the speakers (the Ripple lady, or the banking guy) mentioned the fact that banks could create their own currencies as well.
It's quite possible that PayPal, or some bank may try it, and it would even have some benefits - especially the faster transactions, as blockchain confirmations wouldn't be necessary.
Having said that, I don't think this scenario is likely:
- Bitcoin is distributed, therefore a transaction of sending money between me and you is unregulated. What killed linden dollars for example, was that the regulators forbade gambling with them, and the company had to comply. It's simply impossible to forbid this in Bitcoin. At least the illicit actors will stay with Bitcoin, and maintain some of it's value because of that.
- The funds on your bitcoin wallet cannot be taken away from you. While I personally pay taxes, and try to be as legit as possible, I appreciate *a lot* the security that comes from the fact that government won't be able to take away my funds from me. It's like a swiss account, but for everyone and for free.
- Arguably, Bitcoin will last as long as Internet does. Even if just for the illegal use after everyone switches to PayPalCoins :) It's a protocol, and protocols tend to stay far longer than anyone would expect, or sometimes - want. Companies on the other hand tend to go under, get sold, or go sunset their products. This helps to build trust and value into the currency.
- Also, in case of PayPal coins it's literally just one person's decision to print the new ones, while in case of Bitcoin it would take years of effort to convince a community that we want to change the maximum amount of coins. Another point for bitcoin regarding trust and value.
- And finally, I think people tend to overestimate the power of companies against the network effect gained by first mover advantage. For example, in Poland, eBay was unable to gain any traction, because we already had an auctioning house when they entered. Ebay, with all it's money, expertise, and software failed.
Another case, again related to eBay - they tried to implement their own payment system once they realized people were using PayPal to pay for transactions. They failed, and had to buy PayPal instead.
I believe it would be the same with Bitcoin - why would merchants want to accept yet another virtual currency, when Bitcoin is sufficient? Why would MtGox want start trading PayPal coins if they still haven't implemented Litecoin? Why would people want to switch their value storage from Bitcoin with it's 5-10 years on the market to an upstart with little to no advantages, and some serious flaws? Just because of a brand name? By the time PayPal executives decide to act this way, Bitcoin's brand will be stronger than PayPal's.
Having said that -- who really knows? Perhaps PayPalCoins would have some serious advantages? Perhaps they would be more secure? Or have some other benefit? Fortunately, I think there would be a transition period between Bitcoin and PayPal coins, when more and more people would slowly decide to jump from one currency to the other. It's not like everyone would jump ship the day PayPal would introduce it's PayPal Coins.
Because of that, I don't worry that PayPal will come and wipe my savings :)

Not only it wouldn't work - as LeoPanthera said, but it wouldn't be effective either. If blocks were generated every second, you'd need 3000 confirmations instead of just six to be sure that the transaction went through.
The delay / confirmation time, is a function of how hard it would be to fork the chain to do a double spend. It doesn't really matter whether you have 3 blocks that are hard, or 30 blocks that are 10 times easier to generate. You still need to wait just as long.

+1. The risk on your part may be high, but not '+100%' high. You can convert BTC to USD in any exchange the moment you receive it.
Even more, selling with BTC is safer for you than by using PayPal, or probably even a wire transfer, as there is no risk of a chargeback if someone doesn't like your car after all.

This. In Poland PayPal is not that popular, because banks send non-refundable wire transfers for free and within one working day. Buyer protection still works.
As a small business owner - I prefer to have a harder time finding consumers ( because the buyer protection is slightly worse ) than to risk that someone will claim a big refund long past my legal obligations. On the consumer side - I bought a plenty of things and it's not that big of a deal. It's just that with more expensive stuff it's better to double-check the legitimacy of a website.

Dude, I spent most of the past year researching how bitcoin works - including the technicalities. I assure you I know how bitcoin works. I'm a developer and a businessperson with over ten years of experience, and even without bitcoin I managed to build a successful technical startup.
So, the question goes to you - do you know how the business in general works? 
Yes, you can build in dollar parity, just like e-gold built in gold parity. Just not into a blockchain-based currency. The problem is with aml, and other laws.
As for trusting people, you have to trust them even now. The bitcoin developers could fuck up royally by introducing stupid things into the codebase. Secondly, there exist systems that have been stable for years with a small admin team - just look at piratebay. They are not as solid as bitcoin, but - I'll say it again - they don't have to be. 
If a currency offers another benefits compared to bitcoin, it may take some of the market. One benefit would be the speed of tramsactions, another would be the handlong of dust transactions, yet another would be an easier implementation of colored coins, multi-sig, or time delayed transactions. You probably know what are the issues with those currently, right?
And again, you ignored the essence of what I was saying, and again we're discussing the strawman.

Having no economy in high school is no excuse - get some books on investing and similar subjects. You will either learn, or lose money :)
Also, google, read, observe the market for a month or so. And keep in mind that this is a risky business. The bitcoin price is one thing, but you may lose your bitcoins because of a technical mistake (like no two factor authentication on mtgox, giving it to scammers, etc), because of an exchange collapsing before you take your money out (there were quite a few exchanges that lost money), and so on.
And don't just rely on people telling you that something is a good, or bad investment. Google stuff up, make your own analysis. The market doesn't care that you didn't have eco in high school.

Don't look at charts. That's a sure way to lose money. Look at fundamentals.
For any given chart I can show you three charts from the past looking exactly like this one. One of those charts will show you that the price went up with similar history, another one will show you the price went flat, and another one will show you a crash.
But, if you calculate and decide that Bitcoins are worth - say - $10k in distant future, you'll have stronger grounds to invest. Even if price decides to crash, you'll know that fundamentals are still there, and it will bounce back up sooner or later.

+1. I think one of the biggest risks to Bitcoin is that banks will finally get their shit together and implement fast payment systems.
In Poland wire transfers between any two banks take up to 1 working day (usually half a day), and there's a system for a couple of them where wires take ~15 minutes. Additionally there are systems for merchants which lock money on the sender's account until the wire goes through - and unlike credit cards there are no charge backs.

Law is force. Therefore - in your opinion - if government creates a new law, it's unethical?
What was unethical was the previous retirement law, which strained Poland's budget and took away 4% of peoples retirements and gave it to private corporations. With no benefit to people.
If the new law passes, the government will be responsible for People's money. But previously it was also responsible, just there was a middle man who took a provision with no added benefit.

Well, that's 7% difference. 
If you wanted to arbitrage, you'd need to pay 1% in buying/selling fees, probably also lose another 2% on spread difference, and 1% on bank transfer fees. 
Then, there's some risk involved and so on - that would make for another 3-5% you'd like to charge.

There are no absolute psychological maximums. It seemed that $2 was a lot back when bitcoins went for $0.1. Then people went crazy after it reached $10, it seemed that the psychological maximum was somewhere near that amount.
Now people consider $100 a reasonable sum, and $1000 "a lot", but give it a year at the price we're on currently, and $350 will be considered "normal", and the psychological maximum will be moved again.
As for holding vs. selling.... For most investors there is some money they want to keep in rather stable vehicles (bonds, houses, gold), and a small part that they want to keep in high-risk, high-gain investments.
Once Bitcoin stabilizes (and by "stabilizes" I mean will be over a year at the same price), people will start treating it more as a value store, and not as a risky investment. Therefore some of the money will start flowing away, and some other money will start flowing in. And then we'll reach a semi-stable state, where you'll know that Bitcoin may not bring you 2x your investment, but you probably won't lose 50% either. Just like it's the case with gold.
Oh, and there will always be a group of people who will treat bitcoin purely as a payment vehicle - for them the fluctucations don't matter too much anyway.
Regardless of all the above, just like with stock - it doesn't matter whether it's 200, or 2000, or 20. What matters is the absolute market capitalisation - so, whether all the Bitcoins in existence are worth 2 Billion, 20 Billion, or 2 Trillion. And when you compare Bitcoins (worth now ~3B) to say Gold, which is worth a couple trillion, it's still quite cheap :)

Well, if anyone can exchange LTC into BTC in minutes. And LTC has exactly the same properties, what's the point of accepting Litecoins? They won't improve your sales, and *will* add complexity to the system - it's two times as much work with securing the wallet, and so on.
edit: also, look at how many people who accept BTC also accept LTC. Aside from donations.

Bitcoin is the most transparent and modern payment protocol in the world. It's like a force of nature - stable, predictable and available to anyone who wants to use it. If we're designing a new logo, it should reflect those qualities.

There are situations where 2FA won't help:
- if your computer was compromised at the time of 2FA creation, the attacker could've grabbed the Google Authenticator seed code. there was a girl here some time ago who had her funds snatched this way
- in case of BlockChain.info, 2FA doesn't help much either - it only protects you from someone downloading your wallet from another computer, but if your computer has trojans, they can grab your wallet once it's unencrypted in your computer's memory.

Monopolies can also exist when a barrier to entry is higher than a potential profit to the newcomer.
Examples are quite visible anywhere where we deal with a network effect: for example see eBay and Craigslist which offer generally a shitty service and a poor design, but better services cannot eat up their market share due to the strong network effect behind the incumbents.

According to Wikipedia, compensation is "transfer to the treasury' is a legal seizure without compensation by a government or other public authority."
It's not enough for force to be used, and there are a plenty of situations when government transfers things forcefully where it's not a confiscation. E.g. government may take somebody's land for road building purpose. We don't talk about confiscation then, do we?
Also, nobody lost money really. Before it was based on a promise that government would pay it back to the funds, and they'd pay it back to people after taking their commission. Now the promise changed that the government will pay back the money to people directly. No middle-men. That's it.

"Well, people *are* buying with Bitcoin as we speak. So the real question is not whether people will be buying, but *why* are they buying, right?"
Or simply:
"And yet it moves - and yet they are buying."
Another argument is that bitcoin's deflationary model will stop the economy. My contrargument is:
"Even if it stops the economy, we're dealing with prisoner's dillema here. The humanity might lose by adopting Bitcoin, but individual people will gain. So just because a macro-effect would be negative, doesn't mean people won't go for it."

it's only worth actual money if you can exchange it for goods and services.
if a waiter receives only $1, or even $10 in btc-tips, it may not be worth his time to actually figure out this currency. in addition, he may not find anything useful to buy using bitcoin. which is fine in case of the reddit-tips (as nobody expets them), but not so fine in case of restaurant-tips.
Imagine your employer told you that this month he'll remove a part of your salary, and pay you in bongo-dollars instead. It will be just a miniscule amount, like $10, but you'll need to spend two hours to actually understand what those are, and how to spend them.
what's worse, each next month, you'll be receiving $10 in those bongo-dollars, and you'll need to spend an hour every month to exchange them into "real" currency. 
Because for bongo-dollars you can buy a plenty of cool stuff on the internet, but you can't buy your groceries, pay your bills, or go to a cinema.
Would you think, "o, the employer is so cool", or would you think "fuck him, he's making me waste my time".
Not everyone is interested in bitcoin, and we need to keep that in mind. By tipping only in bitcoin, you're taking a part of that person's earned money, and making him/her go through hoops to redeem it. That's not cool.
And restaurant tip is not a "present". It's a part of the payment for the service the waiter provided. It's rude to not give him a choice of what kind of currency he'd like to receive.
It's like tipping a waiter in Euros while in US. Sure, it's money, but it's an extra hassle for him to exchange those.

now, if somebody was recording your computer screen when you were adding the Google Authenticator, he might've used the QR-code to create his own authenticator clone. that would allow him to add APIs, and so on.
I don't know why would anyone add an API if he/she could as well withdraw the money from your account though. Are you sure you didn't add it? or perhaps it was added before you created the two-factor?

To be honest, as much as I'd love to see a forward thinking bank (i.e. one with a goddamn API), I value my security even more.
Fun fact though - my country (Poland), has one of the best banking systems :) Account setup takes literally 5 minutes, a wire transfers are generally free to $0.30, and take from instant (same bank), to 1 hour to half a working day if it's to any other bank. Because our banking system got a clean start in 1989, we didn't have historical baggage to deal with. That's also why PayPal isn't terribly popular over here - why use PayPal if bank wire transfers are often cheaper and almost as fast.
Basically, the only thing I'm missing from our banking system is the API :)

You should make it explicit in your TOS that you refund either in BTC, or in dollars. Also, for your own good, you should stick with the currency you convert into after purchase.

Well, if the front-end system knows an IP address of the back-end transaction processing system, then the attacker who broke into the front-end system knows that address too, and can try to attack it as well.
Even if backend system only accepts a very limited set of commands from the front-end on one port, and has a ssh access only from the core admin from a dedicated location, it can still be hacked - there's social engineering, and incompetence of a hosting company.
There was one theft once, where the attacker convinced cohosting company to plug in a usb stick containing a trojan into the computer cointaining the "cold" storage.
And even if the backend system is connected only using USB-stick, or some other connection in a secure location, it's still possible to send it fraudulent transactions. The system on the backend doesn't contain all the user's data, or authentication data (it's a job for the frontend), so if it receives a command to withdraw everything to a certain address, it won't know whether it's a genuine command, or a fake one.
Finally, there's a possibility of an inside job, or an attack on a core admin computer. Let's not forget that there are a plenty of programmers working on large systems. Even if company CEO has to sign all the orders, a good programmer could introduce some backdoors to the software.
tl;dr; it's not that simple :)

Just because the lesser formats die out eventually doesn't mean that it's an effective way to develop a new technology. Generally, wars of standards hinder the technology until the wars end.
For example, in Poland, we've got like 4 or 5 ebook reader standards/companies (compared to one leader in US), and it's a clusterfuck. Some companies have some titles, some other have some other titles. At the end I avoid buying polish positions until I really have to.
It's similar with movies &amp; mp3s to some extent (in Poland, and up until 2-3 years ago in US). All the solutions contain just a couple of positions, and I have/had to register in various places to get new mp3s/movies. Again, torrents win.
Or look at how many users Linux lost because of various distros being incompatible with each other in term of package managers. I understand, that forking is an essential part of open source, but still - one shouldn't fork and develop a new standard *unless there's a terribly important reason*
Or look at how Symbian's fragmentation helped the collapse of the whole platform. Because of the fragmentation it took a lot of effort to test apps on all the designs, and the app directory was quite lousy. Wham, comes iOS, and shows how it's being done. (I'm simplifying a bit, but I hope you get my drift).
Or look how various Windows APIs hinder the development process for that platform. Or how various text encodings made it tougher for everyone do develop multi-language apps until UTF-8 came along.
If people have to handle ten kinds of cryptocurrencies, all of them might fail, as nobody will want to install ten wallets on a computer just to pay in all the places. People will say "fuck it, I'll just pay with a credit card". 
Fortunately, Bitcoin has the dominant position for now, and the fragmentation is not a problem. But if the market would get fragmented, we might discover that the next 5 years is being spent on fights between Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin for market adoption. In the meantime U.S. government comes along and builds it's own cryptocurrency - it's US-centric, you can get your funds stolen by the government, but hey - it's easier to implement than a mashup of three others, and you don't have to maintain three separate wallets. U.S. takes the market, and sure - everyone complains about that, and black markets stick to bitcoins, but I - and other entrepreneurs as well - will gladly decide to choose U.S. e-dollar to a fragmented solution.
tl;dr; sure, standard wars resolve eventually, but sometimes the resolution comes too late and a totally competetive solution takes the place (like piratebay taking over a fragmented movie distribution business)

nope. if volume was the issue, the other exchanges would have a higher spread - that is, the buy price would be far higher, and the sell price would be much lower.
it's of course true that other exchange follow up MtGox, but for the past month or so, they've been consistently $10 below the Gox price.

How well does the human brain solve sha-2?
You're also forgetting that the crypto algorithms are usually exponential in nature. That is, a 2 times faster computer means you shave one bit off 256 bits of difficulty. This is still nothing.
In other words - advances in computer computations are immense, but the hashing algirithms are even immensier :)

Just because they are free to do that doesn't mean it's right for them to do so, or that we should cheer them for that.
Example of another such situation - just because someone has a right to destroy food in front of a starving person, doesn't make it right.

You won't achieve that by screaming at them. Stay calm, continue on building the economy, once it's big enough no amount of manipulation will touch it.

you can install a blockchain app, and upload money to your account on your phone (can be sync'd with web wallet as well).
then, someone shows you a qr-code with payment request, you scan it, click "send" and it's done.
(the qr-code contains both a person's account, and the amount, so you don't have to type in anything really)

so, it goes like this, right?
an arbitrage man sells btc for yuan. he then has to convert yuan to usd, get it out of the exchange and back into mtgox or bitstamp, where he can convert it back to btc
but right now, not enough people are doing arbitrage, so the price of btc in china skyrockets - but it will get back down (to the price on the west, not necessarily to below 200), once more people, or more money, joins in. is that correct?
@_date: 2013-09-07 06:32:11
Well, the thing is. The government was never on private accounts really.
A couple years ago, when the current-soon-to-be-previous law passed, the government decided that a half of each Pole's retirement fund would go not to ZUS (the government entity handling retirements), but to OFEs - private companies.
Before you say "oh, cool, now people had their retirements protected from government", listen to the full story...
The same law that made people give away money to OFEs, required those same OFEs to give that same money back to the government, to buy government's debt.
And government had to take a shitloads of debt now, because the whole retirement system couldn't really handle a disappearance of half of the funds. It was either that, or telling current retirees (who currently get like $300-$500 a month, with costs of life similar to what midwest US has) that they need to slash it in half. Which would basically make them homeless and starving.
Oh, and this system - which is unsustainable - still didn't protect the citizens from government's collapse. Because if - in the future - Poland would go bankrupt, the OFEs, which are handling citizen's money, would not guarantee any retirements anyway!
So, after the current law was passed, the people still gave money to the government, but through a middle man who took 4% on the side. The government had to essentially borrow money to put them on savings account.
The only two groups of people who were happy? Lobbyists and people who believe that having cash on corporate account somehow protects them.
So, last months, our PM, finally said "screw it". We eliminated middle-men. The obligation to pay retirements still is on the government's side,  people are just as protected as they were. The only groups who lose are the OFEs who may want to close down shop now. And that's friggin' good.
After years and years of boneless politicians, like the ones who put the original retirement laws in place, we finally have someone who can strighten this shit out. The only problem with current ruling party (aside from marijuana legalisation and gay rights) is that their PR is quite lousy, and they don't explain those things well enough.

The front page contains posts from a limited set of 10 or so subreddits. It doesn't matter how popular is something here - it won't make it to the front page.
OTOH there have been bitcoin stories posted to ither subreddits which made it to the front page.

.You need to pay the same taxes as if you'd pay in Euro.
It's big news in Europe, as so far a few countries (like UK and Poland) said that Bitcoins are more like coupons, and you need to pay an extra VAT when obtraining or paying with them.
Say I want to buy a loaf of bread in Poland.
If I want to pay using the local currency - polish złoty (zł), I have to pay 1zł for the bread, and 0.22zł for 22% of VAT. In total this gives me 1.22zł effective cost of bread.
Now, if I want to pay for a loaf of bread with Bitcoin, in Poland (but it's similar in UK afaik), I need to pay the equivalent 1zł for the bread, and of 0.22zł for VAT. So that's 1.22zł, or 0.003BTC.
BUT when I pay using Bitcoins, the IRS in Poland treats this as a barter exchange, and it means that the retailer needs to pay 22% tax on the Bitcoin he received as well! So the retailer needs to pay 22% * 0.003BTC on top of that! Which makes the bread effectively cost 1.48zł.
In germany, as of now, the tax paid by the retailer on the BTC acquired is not required. So the bread is taxed just once, regardless of whether you pay for in Bitcoin, or in Euro.

The money is - arguably - still there, nobody lost a dime. Just on government's accounts.
Whether people trust the government that the money still will be there when they're bound to retire, that's another thing. And if government decides to not pay back after all - that will be confiscation. But for now - nobody lost a dime.
