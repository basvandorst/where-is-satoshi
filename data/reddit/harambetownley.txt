That me. I wish I could not spend 22000sats on closing a channel. A channel close is not a traditional transaction so its fine having lower priority. I, personally am fine putting tx fees as 800sats which gets the the tx done in a few hours.
Also that tx fees is kept as channel reserve and is unspendable just incase you want to close channel. That kinda sucks because you prolly won't close some channels ever.

He means tx fees to send from exchange to your wallet.
@_date: 2019-03-22 10:41:31
There are 3 ways:
1) buy bitcoin from an exchange like coinbase. Its the easiest way but you can compromise your privacy.
2) mine bitcoin. Its hard because of shear competition but its one of the best and original way.
3) earn bitcoin. Get some work and ask your payment in bitcoin.
To receive bitcoin, you need a wallet. There are some amazing mobile wallets like samourai wallet. You can download them from Google play store. Make sure you protect your private key of your wallet (12 English words).
If you buy bitcoin from an exchange make sure you withdraw your bitcoin because exchanges can get hacked and if its not your key (private key) its not your bitcoin.

If the hash power were to drop by 50% then atmost the next 2016 blocks will be mined every 20mins. After that, the difficulty will readjust to make 10mins blocks again. This means the difficulty will lower so everyone else starts to mines.

Blockchain wallet is not open-source and you should not trust them with that. I recommend using samourai wallet which is segwit enabled and has some amazing privacy features. You can also try eclairs mobile wallet as it has support for lightning network.

MASS ADOPTION
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:38:17
Fair point. Thinking back to the internet. The US tried to control encryption in late 90s which led to even stronger encryption. The US just had to accept the internet at that point.
Maybe they'll just accept it and live with it.
If they do try to attack, the most dangerous one I'd think of would be that they start using backdoors in our machines. A lot of bitcoin nodes run linux and windows. Linux should be fine but windows definitely has a NSA backdoor.
But even after that there's suspicion that intel has a backdoor called intel me. If that's the case, we better get rid of backdoors and get the privacy thing going.
The government isn't supposed to fight us. They're supposed to serve us. And in democratic counties like US and India we might get that. But in totalitarian states like China, we're gonna have to fight.

Do you really think those people understand bitcoin?
They're some clips on YouTube of them talking about bitcoin and they understand absolutely nothing. They have the most generic mainstream media image of bitcoin being a sole currency of criminals and terrorists.
One high ranking RBI official even mocked people (after banning banks to work with exchanges) by saying "people can use cash now haha" - you literally banned an exchange with kyc regulations and encouraged people to buy with cash now? That's opposite of what banks want. Localbitcoins surged that day.

yes please. Why do people still use non-segwit wallets.
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:01:37


Ahh. See ideally you'd send it while requesting for invoice and you'll keep that in your database and update it when the transaction completes.
But I did it differently, in my case the client directly asks another server to update the database once it knows the transaction has completed. This is not very secure but I did it before I couldn't get to call my database from aws. Had some CORs issues.
I only store payreq (invoice) and id. Almost everything else can be retrieved from these.
@_date: 2019-04-15 20:56:43

I'm not a fan of "censoring" but maybe I should do this.
@_date: 2019-04-23 10:52:09
Okay lemme explain,
Here you send a GET request to my lambda function and my function then uses opennode api to get the invoice. The invoice is transferred over https.
You asking for invoice:
You ----&gt; lambda function ----&gt; opennode
Opennode returning the invoice:
You &lt;---- lambda function &lt;---- opennode
And if by data you mean, description, amount etc, then yes. Its inside the invoice. That's really how every lightning payments work. Everything is encoded inside the invoice.
@_date: 2019-04-23 10:46:14
The idea is to first generate a lightning invoice, which you do with the createCharge() and provide of how much you want it to be. You can then return that invoice as a response to your client. For that your code has to be an API. Which is why I used an aws lambda function.
And then save the id that you get from that charge and use it periodically check if transaction has completed. You can use chargeInfo() for that. Again, from an API/lambda function that returns the status as a http response.
The only data I had to provide was the amount, description, and auto_settle and I get the invoice.
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:44:35
Hopefully exchanges adapt to lightning deposits and withdrawals.
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:07:23
Yes its possible! The reason I need a server is for purely compatibility reasons. The opennode api runs on nodejs, so as long as your client can run nodejs it can directly communicate with the opennode node. You can also import the entire node module in js (haven't tried it) but thats means the client would have to download the library every time they visit. But incase of a desktop app its easy to do it directly.
Happy to help!

See, data like amount and description are INSIDE the invoice. They're encoded within the invoice and that's really how all lighting transactions work. You lightning wallet can decrypt it and figure out the amount requested.
@_date: 2019-04-21 17:48:44


That could work but which wallet would I do that for? I wouldn't want to maintain a custodial wallet nor do I ever encourage them. Though I do have something in mind which is probably similar.


I was thinking of doing that, but I'd want them to reset after sometime and for that I'll have to build a service that runs all the time. I'm still learning so I'll see I figure something out.
