I really want companies someday to include payment protocol QRs on regular paper bills so I can can have the following bill payment flow:
* whip out my phone
* scan QR code
* they calculate the current btc bill amount behind the scenes (the paper bill still shows usd)
* they return a signed payment protocol request for the appropriate btc amount
* I hit send
Currently I still pay bills with checks because I don't want to log in and out of eleven different payment portals when I pay my bills.  Being able to do it even faster with bitcoin would make me *so happy*.

* Why is there a 'judge' distinction?  Why not every node?  Who selects judges?  If a user has to choose judges, then that's no different than choosing one or more centralized hosting providers.
* How can you hope to reconcile an entire network without proof of work to indicate a single node to set the consensus for each cycle?
* Does a judge have to talk to every node to assure compliance?  That's trivial to DoS.  If it doesn't, who are its lieutenants?  What keeps them honest?
* Why are proof-of-bandwidth and the nodepool sync process, *the two grandest facets requiring the most thorough explanation*, utterly blank in your current writeup?  Saying you're leaving stuff out to promote community involvement means you don't already have answers and therefore the whole system is bunk.
* The documentation refers to the use of "lambda expressions" because they're "easy to parse, extensible, and easy to construct lists in".  Lambdas are just the abstract concept of anonymous functions.  Did the author mean s-expressions?  That confusion is a pretty big red flag.

It actually has happened before.
Not due to a 51% attack but an attack that leveraged the March 2012 blockchain fork which was caused by a bug.
The double spend (AKA the counterfeit coinage) was accepted by OKPay but later repaid by the purpetrator.  He wasn't really aiming to defraud them but it's vital not to forget that he could have.
So there's a very real risk but it's still *way* easier to detect, mitigate, and reverse than physical counterfeiting.

Uber seems to want totally seamless payments: you ride, they bill your credit card for the cost of the ride *without any interaction on your part at the end of the ride*.  You just hop out of the car.
If they used bitcoin I suppose they'd have to have you deposit coin beforehand so they could automatically debit you.  There'd also have to be some kind of minimum so they could guarantee you'd be able to cover your next ride.
I don't think they want a "thanks for riding; here's your payment QR" situation.

Unless the secret NSA sauce is the fact that bitcoin is using SHA-256, Litecoin is no better in this regard.
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:04:02
It's really because the mining proof-of-work function is SHA-256, which creates a 256 bit output, and the target is the value that the proof-of-work output must be below.
Satoshi probably liked SHA-2, and bitcoin certainly didn't need the other major member of that family, SHA-512.

The difficulty is not stored in the blockchain, but the target is.  Maximum difficulty would be the minimum target, which is zero and corresponds to an undefined difficulty.
The target is an unsigned 256 bit integer which is stored in the blockchain in a funky signed 32 bit ad-hoc datatype.  It can express any magnitude necessary for any difficulty at the cost of precision.  It's analogous to IEEE floating point representation except it stores giant integers instead.

I do mean early adopters of ASICs.
ASIC tech making mining more available is a little more nuanced than that, I think.  Lots of people (myself included) started mining because they already had the equipment.  In the beginning I wouldn't have bought a specialized piece of hardware to mine with.  I'd be interested to know what proportion of miners are doing it just because they already have a good GPU for it.
There's also only so many units that can be produced and sold at a time.  As long as that's less than the demand, there will definitely be an early-adopter window for ASICs in which it's extra profitable.

If you have no idea because you discovered Bitcoin today, you should probably have made a self post with a less inflammatory title like "I'm worried about Dwolla fraud, what's everyone's take on it?".  You may not deserve the downvotes you're getting, but that's what happens when you position yourself the way you have.  Mentioning that you were new and curious would also have made people more amenable to helping you out.
Basically, as others in the thread have said, Bitcoin is extremely trustworthy, and that's how issues like this arise: payments for BTC get reversed, while the BTC transfer itself effectively cannot be reversed.  A reliable and trusted means to get BTC easily is certainly a barrier to acceptance of the currency, but it's trustworthiness isn't really at stake here.

More like the remaining 37 BTC is held by the pool for that rainy day when a block takes 3863200 shares instead of 386320 and they suddenly owe 128 BTC to the miners.  This way the total payout by the pool averages to 50 BTC per block.  Mt. Red doesn't keep anything as profit/upkeep as far as I know.  Most pools do skim some for profit, but Mt. Red is zero fee.

The trick to mining without building a quad graphics card mining rig is to join a pool.  There's an article on the Bitcoin wiki that lists a bunch of pools.  Reddit actually has one at mtred.com.  You basically contribute your power with a bunch of other people and get a proportional slice of the block payout.  I don't actually have links to guides right now; I'm on my phone.  You'll have to dig around or wait for other lovely redditors to hook you up.

Nope!  Just pseduononymous.  With care it can be reasonably anonymous but remember, when a miner finds a block they have to tell people about it.  When they broadcast their successful mined block, it's trivial to simply record who sent it.
Also every transaction ever is publicly available in the block chain.  All you have to do is figure out who owns an address and voila. There are countermeasures you can take though.

It will certainly have an inflationary effect on mining power, yes.
Consider that while ASIC is still hard to come by, more of the proportional hashing power will be held by fewer people.  That's bad for the network but good for early adopters.
Mining reward is vaguely (let me wave my hands here a bit):
    reward * (your hashing power / total network power)
So when ASIC first comes out they'll be more profitable than they will be when everybody who wants one has one.
There's a very miniature gold rush with every major mining power bump.

When the amount paid per share is fixed, there's some risk for the pool.  If there were enough shares between blocks that the payout were more than 50 BTC, then the pool would be in debt.

Does that make sense?

Switching pools is only going to gain you so much (reduction of fees etc).  Also beware that we're pretty small and only average a block a day.  With 500 Mhash you would get a decent chunk per block though; my little machine gets around 0.1 BTC per block.  Lastly, mineco.in uses a PPLNS payment scheme, so it may take a day or so for the payouts to warm up to optimal levels (PPLNS discourages pool-hopping).  Regardless, enjoy your rig and happy mining!

More to the point; joining a pool won't improve the amount you make per unit time (it may slightly reduce it depending on on pool policy), but it breaks the payouts up into smaller, more frequent payments.  However, given that difficulty increases over time, there can be some strict advantage over solo mining on the same hardware.  I mine with  and they distribute every bitcent to the miners, including transaction fees received in the block, which is unusual for a pool.

I don't know of any sellers that do what your counterpoint suggests and charge more for credit and less for cash, it's simply that some sellers take credit and charge more no matter what and others do not take credit and charge less.

Unfortunately that discussion is total hogwash.
The entire premise is that it's harder with litecoin than with bitcoin to get a bunch of blocks in a row on the main blockchain.  However, what attacks does that allow?  None!  The worst you could do is mine several empty blocks and hold up transactions until a legitimate miner mined a block, but you don't even need blocks in a row to do that (thus bitcoin and litecoin are equivalent in that regard).
To use mining power for an attack, it is necessary to cause a chain reorganization.  In order to do that, the attacker must start mining *off the main chain*.  When you're on your own chain, the idea of six blocks in a row is meaningless, because you're the only one mining on that chain.  In order to trigger a chain reorg and reap your double spend, you have to get your private chain longer than the main chain and then release it.  That means all that matters is that you have more hash power than all the miners on the main chain since you're racing them in terms of chain length.  Again, that requirement is equivalent between bitcoin and litecoin.
Someone might say "but mining six in a row on the main chain is the same as mining six off the main chain before anyone else finds a block on the main chain!".  That's not true either.  Each of the six-in-a-row on the main chain forces other miners to start their search over, while the six off the block chain doesn't, and legitimate miners are very likely to get another block.
Even if you might get lucky sometimes and get six off chain before anyone else got one on the main chain, every time you fail you lose the coins you tried to double spend.  So in order to attempt such an attack, the attacker has to be damn sure they can pull it off.  Being sure means having more power than all legitimate miners (51% attack).  Again, equivalent between bitcoin and litecoin.
The author of that post displays a major misunderstanding of bitcoin's (and therefore litecoin's) design.  Worse, it sounds very nearly correct to most people without some deep thought, so it gets repeated a lot.
TL;DR: Mining a bunch of blocks in a row on the main chain *is no big deal*, and litecoin's shorter block time is neither more nor less secure than bitcoin's.

@_date: 2013-09-16 17:14:14
The reason I like that analogy (aside from the fact that it supports my desired outcome), is because at its core, bitcoin and the Internet (or email, as I more often use) are about doing something fundamental to civilization in a more efficient way.
The Internet is really just the logical conclusion of a postal system, but it carries only information.  Even early detractors of the Internet would never have said no to being able to instantly and securely order goods instead of having to mail an order form and payment and wait.  It wasn't that what the Internet offered wasn't amazing and universally appealing, it was that using it carried significant cognitive work because people were used to doing things the way they always had.  Ordering from catalogs worked *well enough*.  It took both very high-quality online retailers (Amazon), *and* simply time for society to adjust to and become familiar with the Internet's existance.
I see bitcoin in a similar light.  It's foreign to most people, it's still hard to get and use for the most part, and most importantly the legacy financial system has gotten people through their lives thus far, so why should anyone take the effort of adjusting to bitcoin when they have a good understanding and intuition of the risks and how to use credit cards etc.
Add on top the fact that both the Internet and bitcoin are free and open, especially the fact that any curious tinkerer can try and create something on top of them without needing licensing or even permission.
Give the whole world a blank canvas and sometime somewhere a Michelangelo will emerge with a masterpiece.

You've got it.  Other commenters are talking about selecting the right blockchain branch, which is not what OP is asking.
Even if attackers (possibly in the form of authorities) tried to shut down the built-in bootstrap nodes it would only affect new users since the client caches peers like you mentioned.  That means the network at large wouldn't be affected, which is the most important.

All transactions are public!  That may sound awful, but let's look at it a bit closer:
Bitcoin is a system that doesn't require you to trust any one individual or group.  Someone has to keep track of transactions, and the only group we trust is everyone, which means everyone keeps track so everyone knows.  (Specifically everyone running a bitcoin node keeps track).  There are clever systems in place to automatically sort out disagreements and conflicts without human intervention.
To avoid the horrendous privacy issue of a public transaction log, you aren't identified by your name, nor email, nor anything else trivially linked to you.  The transactions are shown as being between two bitcoin addresses, like so:
    1HfJ2yLiU8GC5axtwHBR3KvbrnPtprzhJv paid 0.01 BTC to
    1ncBgWj8uevijdp6tkQzjhM2wbDr4Fcvd
Here's a real example transaction:   Who made this transaction?  We don't know!
So unless you know who owns those addresses you know nothing!
Anyone can own as many addresses as they want (seriously, every person on earth could have 178 trillion addresses before they started to get thin), and you don't even need to be connected to the internet to generate them.  Since you don't have to sign up anywhere to use bitcoin, nobody knows which addresses you own unless you tell them (like when you buy some bitcoins the seller has to know your address in order to pay you your BTC).
Does that make sense?

Linking your transaction to your IP address is tricky under all circumstances.  When your computer sends your transaction, the recipient has no way of knowing if you made the transaction or are simply relaying it as it is about to.

Vendors build the cost of dealing with fraud (from chargebacks etc) into prices.  Eliminating or severely curtailing chargebacks could effectively eliminate that cost.
Passing that cost along to buyers in the form of better prices would be a competitive advantage.
That's why you might care about lack of chargebacks.
Additionally, whenever you pay with a credit card you run the risk of identity theft because people can use the info you divulge to impersonate you and make other purchases.  With bitcoin you send the money directly from your wallet and you expose nothing that could allow someone else to send your money.
You might not find it useful, but don't assume everyone who is behind it is a 'right-wing fringe group' member or has something to hide.

Initially, your node will use bootstrapping systems like hard-coded bootstrap addresses and the DNS bootstrap system to just find someone.
From there I believe your node will hear about other nodes on the network and so may branch out.
If you go to the RPC console from Bitcoin-QT, the `getpeerinfo` command will dump info on everyone you're currently connected to.

This gets asked all the time:
The 'easiest' way to steal your coins like this would be to create a colliding address (another private key that produces the same address).
There are 2^160 possible bitcoin addresses, which means on average you'll have to make 2^159 (half as many) tries to find a specific address (like yours).
Now image that deriving an address from a private key were as fast as a bitcoin mining hash, which it isnt.
Now imagine we have 6x the power of the entire bitcoin network trying this 24/7.
It would take over 5,000,000,000,000,000 times the age of the universe to find your key.

The fact that bitcoin's proof of work isn't useful anywhere else is a *strength*.  It is good that an attack on bitcoin means buying a ton of hardware that has *no other use* if the attack fails.  That makes attacks in general a lot less appealing unless the attacker is very sure it will work, and that sureness is monumentally expensive.
Additionally the "but bitcoin wastes so much power!" argument is also silly because securing a stateless payment system and currency is hardly a waste, and all other payment systems and currencies use tons of power too!
As for primecoin (which I realize is all that you specifically are talking about), while it's a very cool proof of concept, I have yet to hear of a use for cunningham chains, which are what primecoin actually finds.

There are no usernames and passwords in bitcoin, just like there are no usernames and passwords for cash.
It looks like you're looking at bitcoin like a bank, when your wallet is really just like an envelope you put money in.
You tell people who are going to pay you your address and they put the bitcoin in directly.  Then only you can remove money from that address unless someone steals your wallet.
If you lose your wallet, your coins are lost *forever*.  If someone breaks into your computer and drains your wallet your coins are lost *forever*.  It's just like losing cash in a house fire or home invasion.
Don't take bitcoin any more lightly than you would treat cash.  Lots of people have lost money through carelessness because they assume bitcoin is more like an insured bank deposit than a wad of dollar bills under their mattress.

If you make a wallet backup, make 101 transactions, and then lose your current wallet, you'll lose the change from your 101st transaction, which could be most of your coins.

Volatility is definitely a big issue.  It has to happen, though.  Until bitcoin is well-known around the world by non-techies there will always be bursts of new interest that spike the price.  Stability requires lots of time.
My suggestion doesn't lessen bitcoin volatility, but it is a good solution to your issue of being frustrated by BTC gains after you spend.  That of course requires that you can buy bitcoins easily.
If gains after spending bother you that much and you can't easily replace when you spend, then you're right, you shouldn't be spending BTC.  Give it time.

A lot of your technical questions could be solved by using an [assurance contract]( implemented within a single bitcoin transaction itself.
Clients don't support this yet (the protocol already does!), but in a future where they do it would be perfect.
With a bitcoin contract, you get several zero-trust mathematically guaranteed benefits:
* Funds will not be released until the goal is met.
* Backers can be refunded at any time without requiring an additional transaction and thus without losing fees.
* No single party needs to keep track of who has backed the item; it's all written into the contract itself.
* Only one transaction (the contract) ends up in the blockchain and thus only one miner's fee is required.

No; change does not go back to the original sending address.
A new address is generated by your wallet for every transaction and change is sent to it.

When difficulty increases, fewer coins are generally made, yes.  However it should be closer to 25 every 10 minutes.
For example: yesterday (June 4) the rate was about 25 every 7 minutes.  That's too fast so the new difficulty attempts to slow it back down to 25 every 10 minutes.

The coins that wouldn't send were change from your previous transactions.
If you receive 1 BTC from someone, you have to spend that 1 all at once.  Transparently to you, your wallet is creating a new address and sending the remaining 0.95 BTC or whatever back as change to that new address.
The delay is waiting for confirmation of your transaction so you know your change is in the right place for a new transaction.

Many nodes will only pass along so many 'free' transactions per hour in order to prevent spam.  If you got caught on the wrong side of that your transaction may have been dropped.

The long sync time has literally nothing to do with the fork.
The problem is that you're using a client that requires you to download the entire history of every transaction ever made in bitcoin.

Bitcoin transactions originate from bitcoin addresses, which have no national affiliation.  The originating IP address of a transaction can be approximated by being very well connected and assuming the node you receive a transaction from is the originator, but that's trivially thwartable.

You don't even have to worry about merchants keeping an unencrypted copy.  A PIN is a remarkably poor entropy source for an encryption key.

ASICs (dedicated mining computers) are pretty hard to get a hold of, and won't be super profitable in the near future as they eventually become the norm.
The question of just buying some comes down to this: How do you feel about the long-term prospects of bitcoin?
I think it's a marvelous innovation that will enable more and more cool stuff as time goes on.
I don't doubt there will be more price corrections (crashes) in the future, possibly even way back down below $100.

Bugs in the protocol or reference client could lead to counterfitting.

You've got a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of bitcoin transactions, but that's ok.
Without your private keys, no one can cause funds in your addresses to be spent.  Not by fees nor any other means.  They could indeed create a bogus transaction to spend your coins, but without a correct signature from the corresponding private key it would be dropped by the network immediately.  Transactions dropped by the network have no effect.  Fees are a form of spending and thus also require a signature from the appropriate private key.
What happened is someone stole your private key, likely from a keylogger or some other attack as you suspect, and wrapped their theft of your mBTC into a larger transaction.  Any number of addresses can be inputs to a transaction.  Moving small amounts like 1 mBTC can be prohibitively expensive due to fees, so the attacker rolled your money up into one big transaction that might contain other thefts.  Moving all 9 inputs to the 20.4 BTC transaction would have cost 9 fees, but this amalgamated transaction only needed one (of 0.0004 BTC).  It's a totally valid transaction and has been confirmed over 2000 times.
TL;DR: Someone stole your keys and withdrew from your address and several others all in one big valid transaction to save on fees.  If you keep your private keys safe tip jars are just as safe as any other bitcoin address.  There is no significant security advantage to hiding your addresses, hiding them only improves privacy.

Absolutely; it's one of the most contentious issues in bitcoin's future.
The limit could be raised with a simple change of the [MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant]( but the majority of the network would have to accept that change by choosing to run wallets/clients that have the raised value.
By keeping the block limit low (maybe not at 1MB), users are forced to pay more in fees to ensure speedy processing.  That makes mining more profitable which will attract more miners which is healthy for the network.  Low fee transactions will likely clear at some point, but it could severely curtail some of bitcoin's uses.
Eliminating the limit or making it huge will keep bitcoin cheap or free to use, but only the most efficient miners may be able to afford to compete.  That could mean only a few large mining corporations controlling the network.

A gaming PC is unlikely to be useful even in a mining pool, much less alone.
If you have free electricity and you don't mind putting a lot of load on your graphics card 24/7 then you might as well try pooled mining.
Then you can decide if the payouts you get are worth your while.
If you have an extremely powerful GPU you might expect to earn about 0.3 BTC over the course of six months, or roughly 0.0008 BTC a day on average which at the current exchange rate is about $0.10 a day.

I don't know about iOS, but Android devices with USB OTG could absolutely interface with Trezor without Bluetooth.
I think it's an important distinction that Trezor is a wallet theoretically meant for day-to-day spending while coincoffer is meant for long term storage.  That may help reduce the inevitable "why not just Trezor" comments.
If you improve your transparency there's definitely a market for this I feel.

Unfortunately there are zero meaningful ways to implement this.
The problem comes from the fact that no matter how secure your client is, someone can just steal your wallet and use their normal less secure client.
The only way to thwart such an attack is by encrypting your private keys.  Unfortunately there is no way to say "only decrypt with this password if I'm spending less than 1 BTC" without introducing a third party or some other tangential form of security.
It's like setting the world's most secure password to lock your PC.  An attacker doesn't need to guess your password at all, they can just grab the hard drive and read your data on another machine.  Encryption is the only practical solution to this.
As `Narmotur` mentioned, the best answer is to keep the bulk of your coins in cold storage that's highly secure but annoying to get to, and keep a little spending money in a hot wallet that's less secure.

I don't quite understand.
In none of these scenarios are transactions undone, bitcoin transactions are irreversible.  Additionally, your wallet doesn't keep track of transactions, it only holds the keys that let you spend from your addresses.
Further understanding of the trouble of letting your backups get too old requires a fairly deep understanding of the technical implementation of bitcoin.  Are you interested in learning all that?  Otherwise just remember to update your backups every 50 transactions or so.

Not really.  I'm not likening the likelihood of bitcoin's success to winning the lottery, I'm pointing out how absurd it is to assume a risk is a good risk simply because the loss is low and reward is high *without considering probabilities*.
If my use of a game appears to fall under that fallacy, consider that the original logic applies to buying 65 USD of some altcoin I create right now.  Sure, you only stand to lose $65 and could gain millions, but if you don't think about the likelihood of my altcoin going mainstream you're making a fatal error.
In other words, anyone thinking about buying into bitcoin should carefully consider not only their potential gain, but how likely they think bitcoin is to succeed in a big way.

AES and SHA are apples and oranges.  SHA1 doesn't encrypt anything.
FileVault on the Mac does use AES for encryption, it simply also stores a SHA1'd copy of the passphrase so Miner_Willy was able to find the correct password by hashing and comparing.

The transaction fee is held separate from the balance transmitted.
If you send 0.1125, you could be either sending 0.112 with a 0.0005 transaction fee or 0.1125 with a 0.0000 transaction fee.  They would be different transactions.
Nobody does any guessing as to whether or not a fee is included.
If you wanted to speed up your sending of 0.113, you could add a 0.0005 transaction fee.  The transaction would cost you 0.1135, but your recipient would only get 0.113.
Adding a fee makes your transaction 'significant' simply because miners will want to include your transaction so they can claim the fees in it.

There's a shocking number of coders who show up here that believe that by writing code themselves its somehow more secure than well-vetted public code.
Just recently there was another site where it was claimed to be unbackable because the dev wrote a custom db instead of using MySQL et al.
When the NASHX exchange first launched, the developer claimed it was perfectly secure because he wrote it.  It was then immediately discovered that you could inflate your balance by offering to trade a negative amount of coins.  Not only were the user-provided inputs not sanitized or even checked, but the trade engine accepted negative values.  The dev brushed off this horrifying hole by saying something like "that doesn't count because I fixed it real quick".

Bitcoin is a currency that is controlled collectively by anyone who wants to join.

By destroying private keys you aren't returning any coins to be mined again, but you are effectively ensuring a slightly higher value of each coin through deflation, which gives back not only to future miners but to all bitcoiners.
Or, another way to look at it, once ECDSA and RIPEMD160 are eventually cracked, bitcoin treasure hunters will reverse the addresses of any coins that haven't been moved to newer safer addresses.  In this scenario your coins themselves are returned to the economy.  This of course depends on bitcoin outliving two well-tested crypto primitives.

Because what your password is really used for is to create an encryption key.
Your old wallet was encrypted with the key derived from your old password.  When you later changed your password, Bitcoin-QT re-encrypted your wallet with the new key.
In order for your expected behavior to occur, Bitcoin-QT would have had to have searched your drive for the backup, found it, and then re-encrypted it as well.
So basically Bitcoin-QT didn't 'allow' you to change the password, the math just lined up.

There are certainly pros and cons:
* Nobody can tell you whom you can and can't send money to (like PayPal blocking donations to WikiLeaks)
* Fees are low without a middleman
* Transactions are lightning fast compared to bank transfers or western union etc
On the flipside
* If you get scammed, there's no one to complain to.  However just like traditional cash you can use third party arbitration to help with that.  (consider eBay for traditional cash: bitcoin has sites like bitmit.net that work the same way)

As more people mine, the network automatically makes it harder to mine coins so that overall roughly 25 coins are made every 10 minutes.
So if you start mining, and then tons more mining power comes online (which has been steadily happening), the amount of coins you get will drop sharply.

At least in the case of software that reads from /dev/random on Linux, it's not where your mouse moves, but hardware noise from your input devices.  You could move the mouse exactly the same way multiple times and get very different results because noise is, well noise.

Unfortunately, not with Bitcoin-QT.
Every time you send coins, your wallet (at least Bitcoin-QT) creates a new address and sends the change from the transaction to that address.
That means the copies of your wallet will eventually go out of sync and some of your coins will only be accessible from one copy or the other, among other weirdness like incorrect balances.
If you really want to use the same wallet in multiple places, you might want to use a web wallet from blockchain.info.  Then you can access the wallet through the web on your mac and through the blockchain.info iOS or Android programs.
What I would recommend for safety and security is to keep the majority of your coins on your Mac with encryption enabled in Bitcoin-QT, and then just keep a small amount on your phone for day-to-day spending.  When your phone gets low, just send some from your nice cozy secure Bitcoin-QT wallet to refill your phone.
That way if someone steals your phone they only have access to the funds on it.

The block size limit prevents bitcoin from having a transaction rate comparable to other systems, yes.  Some would solve this by lifting that limit, others suggest moving the majority of transactions off the blockchain which would involve trusting third parties.
Transaction time, by which I assume you mean the average 10 minute confirmation time, is almost never an issue.  Confirmations indicate a likelihood that a transaction will be reversed due to a chain reorganization.  As it stands now, reorgs are so infrequent that for small purchases accepting 0conf transactions holds little danger.  If you're buying a car or a house, you can afford to wait an hour.

My understanding is that it that BIP 32 is the only way it works.

Since coinbase funds bitcoin purchases with ACH transfers, which are reversible quite a long time after the fact, they have to use a bunch of heuristics to try and stop scammers from buying coins and then taking back their USD too.

Likely an attacker would start working on a large double-spend or spends, but that would require all the stolen hashing power disappearing from the main chain.
That would be noticed quickly, and not just by the pool operators.
At that point either the pool operators are honest and they regain control of the pools or miners start to flee since their mining rewards will be invalid if any significant amount of hashing power is lost and the fork being created to attack the main chain loses any hope of becoming the longest.

I think it's misleading that others are saying wallets generated offline are registered in the blockchain.
I think what they mean is that wallets generated online and offline have the same presence in the blockchain, which is none.
The blockchain doesn't keep track of accounts, it only tracks transactions.  When bitcoins are sent to an address, a transaction is added to the chain saying "whoever has the private key to this address can spend these coins".
Now the magic is that the public key (the address) and private key are related mathematically.  The blockchain doesn't need to register their relationships; anyone can verify them with a little math!
So if you generate a wallet offline and send some coins to one of that wallet's addresses, then they're your coins just the same as if you had generated the wallet online.  All you'd need to spend those coins is to import the corresponding private key into a bitcoin program and spend!
