Can you recommended the best way to mine the currencies you mentioned in Windows 10? Im new to this all and am currently mining bitcoin through NiceHash with my 1070. I could easily move to Linux if it makes a big difference, but since I also game in Windows it would be easier to not have to switch OS all the time.

Can you expand on that? How is ethereum centralized? Just calling them shitcoins isn’t very convincing.

Most people here are idiots. A good rule of thumb is to buy when it’s the lowest it’s been in a week.  Better rule of thumb is buying when it’s the lowest it’s been in a month. You bought near the high of the month, so you might need to wait a bit for profits. 
Whether it goes up or down long term is anyone’s guess, but I think it’ll go beyond 9.8 in the next month or so. It’s not going to zero anytime soon, so you’re not going to lose your money. If you don’t absolutely need that money, hold, and you’re likely to at least break even in the next month or so, imo.

Top 5 dumbest posts I’ve ever seen in this thread. Congrats. The grammar mistakes really sold it to me.

You are ignoring the fact that opening and closing a channel costs time and money (normal transaction fees and delays, which are growing daily). It is not free like connecting to WiFi. So if my phone battery never died, I could keep a channel open 24/7 and be connected to the lightning network. If my phone dies and I have to reconnect, it could cost $20 and take an hour. Not feasible. 
I’m not sure if you didn’t know that opening and closing a channel costs time and money, or you chose to ignore it, but it is a big deal. It is the basis of the argument that one would need a 24/7 channel open to make LN feasible for daily use.

I’m not gonna argue the ethics of it, but I would say the society we live in entitles anyone to profit as a reseller. By law, it is allowed. We live in a capitalist society where people are incentivized to screw others over for profit. Almost everything you buy could be bought for less, but someone is screwing you over to make a buck.  You just accept it in the context of retail. If something is being sold below market value, there is a huge incentive for someone to step in and take that profit. In retail, you don’t see the middle man selling to distributors for lower costs per item, but here you do. Same thing, but with more transparency. Be upset with the system, not the players.

A safe haven, by [definition]( is mainly about price stability and I think we can all agree this price isn’t stable.

We’ll see. I’ve been to GTC the last 2 years and it is not gaming oriented *at all*. I won’t be surprised if they announce new Tesla cards only and wait to announce new gtx cards at a different venue. GTC is like 99% scientific computing related, besides the virtual reality booths they setup for entertainment. I’ll be there again this year though and will definitely be hoping for a gtx announcement.

Would love to see an analysis of your previous analyses to see how often you are actually right...when you predict specific numbers in particular, I bet you are right way less than half the time. If you just predict up or down, obviously you should be right about half the time. 
What use is predicting the future when you don’t analyze how good your predictions are?

Check out NiceHash. With it, you are not mining directly, but rather selling your hashing power on an exchange. People that buy the hashing power are mining alt coins. It’s not even close to profitable to mine bitcoin with a GPU anymore (bitcoin is mined with ASICS now). 
For reference, with NiceHash, I’ve made about $90 in the last month and a half with my 1070, after subtracting electricity costs. You get paid in bitcoin tho, so if you hodl, you might be making more (my $90 is at current btc price). I also game quite a bit, and am not “mining” while gaming, so your mileage may vary.

Maybe. 99% of predictions I have read about btc have been wrong, whether they predicted it would go up or down. It did not go moon, the buy wall at 9k didn’t hold, nor the one at 8k. 
I’m not making a prediction myself here, I’m just saying, who knows. It might be under 1k at the end of the year, it might be back over 20k. This crash since December happened in 1 month and there are 11 months left in the year. Saying it’s over definitively is...I can’t find the right word at 7am on the toilet, but you get my point.

I don’t think you can call a rebound after 2 days. The price has been dropping and rebounding for a month, but generally tending downward. If it’s above ~12k at the end of Feb I think we can call a rebound then.

They said lightning won’t be enough, not that it won’t scale well for its intended purpose. Lightning doesn’t solve the problem that opening and closing channels costs fees and time. It’s not possible for end users to have channels open constantly either. So if I want to go to the store to buy something with bitcoin, lightning isn’t going to help me unless I trust a third party to hold my money and keep channels open on my behalf. 
I think LN solves some problems, but i haven’t heard a good argument for how it can help btc function as a liquid currency. Bitcoin right now is setup to be a great store of value, but I don’t see a roadmap for becoming a daily use currency. Please inform me if I’m mistaken.

Validation through Coinbase took me 10 min to link my bank account and have a $7500 per week buy limit. Just sayin. It could take weeks, sure, but it took me and my gf 10 min each.

Same, except I’m holding til 5x lol. Lofty goals. Good luck to ya.

Your [predictions]( have been spot on recently. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:21:22
In order for what you said to be true, wouldn’t I need to trust a third party to hold my money then? Like my wallet would need to be in the cloud somewhere on a machine running an LN node? Or am I still not getting it?

Interesting analogy, I hadn’t thought of it like that before. Thanks for having a reasonable conversation and giving me some insight into the possibilities with LN.

The price is locked at the time you buy. If you buy at 8k, that’s what you’ll get, not the price 5 days from now when it shows up in your account. It’s pretty damn nice for a $2 flat fee, imo. 
Edit: I would note that my first purchase took like 10 business days to show in my wallet. Every purchase after has been ~5 business days. Just FYI.

Is metallic ion leaching a consideration in these setups? In a normal liquid cooling setup, the dielectric fluid running through the pumps and cooling blocks leaches ions and becomes conductive within a few weeks typically. Is the volume of dielectric fluid here so great that the time span for the liquid to become conductive makes it not a consideration? Or do you have ion filtration to control this?
Also, do you mind telling us what fluid you’re using? I noticed you don’t have a cover on to avoid evaporation, so maybe an oil instead of one of those 3M products? Assuming it is an oil, isn’t it a pain to take a miner out for maintenance? I guess that is probably rarely needed here though. 
Anyways, great job! I’ve seen many of these setups at trade shows and they’re always impressive looking.

How will lightning help me buy a pizza without fees and delays? It won’t unless I keep a channel open 24/7. Lightning is not going to help end users utilize bitcoin as a day to day currency, so now bitcoin is being promoted as a store of value. That was not what it was originally promoted as, as far as I know. It was supposed to be a global unregulated currency and I haven’t seen a roadmap that shows how btc will get to that point.

Coinbase took me 10 min to link my bank account through the app and make a purchase. $2 flat fee on all purchases for me, though it has taken 5-7 business days for the btc to show up in my wallet. It shows up instantly if I buy with my credit card, but it’s a $7 flat fee that way for me and I’m not in a rush. Just thought I’d share my experience. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:12:25
Straight from wiki for you to think about:
“The most common store of value in modern times has been money, currency, or a commodity like a precious metal or financial capital. **The point of any store of value is risk management due to a stable demand for the underlying asset**.”
Bitcoin is not a very attractive currency or store of value at the moment. Fees and delays are ok for a store of value, but instability is not. Bitcoin is about as unstable as it gets and it will probably remain that way for a few years at least. 
People investing today are speculating that bitcoin will *become* a stable store of value or a usable currency. Today it is not useful for either.

Ya...as long as you’re connected to the LN network, and the seller is as well, you’re good to go. Don’t need to be directly connected, just need a route between the two. Your transaction can go between many nodes.

Gradually rising? What about Friday where it shot up about as much as it just dropped?
