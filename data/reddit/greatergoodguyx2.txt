How long after halving do you expect the bull run? I heard it took more than a year when the last halving occur for the bull run to reach the peak.
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:24:03
just freaking cost average buy or cost average sell. So basically if your intent is to sell, convert 10% of your holdings to cash every month. Why is it always "go all in" with this dang community?
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:22:57
Yea I can understand that. I'm a passive investor so I like the easy tools and reliability of coinbase, so I don't mind the higher fee. It's easy to set recurring transaction, and I have a set it and forget it strategy. I'm preparing for moon 2020.

I remember getting back into crypto investing a few months ago and I went to and being so fucking confused until I realized it was a bcash subreddit. Then I went to and saw that they made a coordinated effort to hijack And it's super fucked up that they will mislead and deceive people.

I LOVE it when it goes down. The ideal situation to maximize profit is a multi-year bear cycle so my slow constant drip feeding of fiat to crypto will accumulate. If it moons tomorrow, I will still be happy though profits won't be as big.

Hello Ramen, my old friend...
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:29:37
most in bitcoin, a little bit in ethereum. I plan to sell on next spike, but not all at once like most fools. I will take take portions of my profits over time. If the market crashes before I cash out my profits, I will keep the remaining Bitcoin in and continue putting in more money into bitcoin with recurring transaction.   
The reason I believe in Bitcoin so much is due all the companies, entrepreneurs, banks, and governments getting into crypto. Too many people are invested for it to fail. Anyone who opts out will eventually feel like they are missing out. You just have to stay in long term, but I definitely predict another spike within 10 years
@_date: 2018-08-04 05:05:15
I tried it. So you may or may not get bitcoin, though it looks like you probably will. But you're not just shortening links. You are redirecting clickers to an intermediate website which tries to load your computer with viruses and junk and requiring the user to click a button to arrive at the destination site. Posting such a link on facebook will give you a big error message saying it likely includes a virus and tells you to remove it.

So... you are saying Detroit failed? You just proved the OP's point.
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:42:46
ugh why are so polite? Now I feel bad about how rude I was. I guess I wanted to attack someone rather than explain my side clearly. Thank you for being reasonable. 
Here is how I should of explained myself. When I think of "too big to fail" I think back to the 2008 financial crisis, where government and financial institutions were saying to give the banks a bailout, because they were too big to fail. I like the phrase you used "Too big too fail is referring to an institution that would have very large adverse effects if it failed."
Now in hindset, many wonder if it would of been better in the long run to just have let the banks fail. 
Sorry I didn't explain myself and attacked you. I was an ass.
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:47:58
I don't know about him, but I am basing it off the fact that too many companies, banks, and governments are invested in Crypto for it to fail.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:27:07
Noone is saying it's Detroit's fault. Do a Ctrl-F for the word 'fault' and you will find that noone said that word. 
What OP said is that noone is too big to fail, that "too big to fail" does not exist. You are saying there are institutions that are so big that they are resilient to failure. Then provided an example of an institution that failed.
Anyways I'm still confused as to your question "How is it Detroit's fault?". Who claimed it Detroit's fault? And what does that have to do with too big to fail?
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:07:15
Yea I remember how complicated this issue was back in 2008. I remember Jon Stewart from the daily show advocating to give the bailout money to the people, who would use that money to pay back the banks. I think this would be better as the banks get their money and the people get their houses.
I hope that if a financial crisis happens again, we try something different. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:52:59
If you need to sell to pay bills, you aren't doing it right.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:13:37
Great question. It's tricky because for all we know, we could be inside the dip already. My strategy is dollar cost averaging, which means I've been drip feeding my money on a consistent fixed schedule since last July. Every week $X goes from my bank account into crypto. It is all automated, so I've basically only had to make that one decision to start investing, and everything is auto-pilot. 
The transaction occurs every Monday at Midnight. So 12 hours ago, I bought a bit more Bitcoin when it was priced at $7100. Next Monday, another $X will go into crypto. I strongly advised this strategy of DCA, because it removes so much decision making and risk.
As long as you believe that in the long term, that Bitcoin will exceed current prices, you should have no regrets, even buying at these prices. When I started investing in Bitcoin, it was priced at $8000, and I still consider that a bargain when thinking long term.
@_date: 2019-05-09 10:59:38
Thanks captain obvious
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:38:47
Ahhh I see I see. Well even with a small investment, you could split it up into two chunks and try to time the market twice, rather than go all in at once. It can reduce your risk quite a bit (but may also reduce reward a little bit also).
@_date: 2019-05-09 17:22:34

@_date: 2019-05-13 18:02:33
This kind of thinking is why you missed out at 3k levels. You have to think long term and not short term. The people who bought at 3k will 6x their money when it reaches the previous ATH. If you buy now, you will 3x your money. If you wait till it's up to 10k, you will only 2x your money.   
Stop worrying about the daily dips. You buy during the weekly/monthly dips, but people who try to time the daily dips are the ones of lose money.
@_date: 2019-05-09 07:41:09
