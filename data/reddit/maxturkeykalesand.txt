There are always exceptions, not everyone is rational.  The big server farms are run by business people though, people who are keenly watching the daily P&amp;L and carefully considering electricity costs.  These people aren't going to hemorrhage money as a bet that bitcoin will eventually rally.

Incorrect.  Some marketplaces heavily police their userbase, others police them moderately, others don't police them at all.

Your response doesn't apply to bitcoin.  There is no one trading bitcoin who *doesn't believe* the halvening will happen.  *Everyone* trading bitcoin (the only people who matter to the price) are at least aware of the halvening and it impacts how they value bitcoin to some degree.  Remember, the issue here isn't that everyone needs to buy in anticipation.  Price is set at the margin.  One single whale could full price in the halvening, or simply people choosing not to sell.

Treating miners as a cartel and advocating a major protocol change willy-nilly is horrible.  It's exemplifies the problem with Back and a lot of developers - technically focused tech experts who are totally ignort of the economic side of bitcoin.

Just as communism naturally leads to fascism because of human nature, so too does market capitalism naturally degenerate into corporatism and crony capitalism.  And for the very same reason.  People with power (under either a capitalist or communist system), look to erect barriers to protect their power and acquire more.  Every single big name US capitalist (Rockefeller, Gates, Morgan etc) engaged in monopolistic behavior including regulatory capture.

The decline is real, but it won't continue forever.  Browsers usage will eventually stabilize at some level.

 Oh boy, where to start.  First, it treats miners as a cartel.  Some of us prefer to encourage decentralization.  Second, the rate of bitcoin creation and transaction confirmation times are two of the cornerstones of bitcoin, core to the "social contract" that Adam Back likes to reference.  To talk about changing those via minority soft fork willy-nilly is crazy.

It's neither hateful nor nonsense.  Just simple facts.  Just one example: blockstream is working on the hyperledger project: 
There's nothing wrong with projects like this.  I think altcoins and fiat-based blockchains will add a lot of value to society.  But to some degree they compete with bitcoin.  And blockstream is spending the majority of their time working on fiat-blockchains and altcoins.

Jesus, how can anyone trust Back after a statement like that?
@_date: 2016-04-08 16:51:09
I don't know.  Borrowing in BTC 2 years ago would've been pretty sweet.  Crypto and fiat don't directly compete.  Crypto is more of a competitor to gold imo.

Venmo and Paypal already let people send money over the internet for free.  Yes, they're "trusted 3rd parties", but for small transactions, the "trust" is irrelevant, and the "service" is free, so disintermediation doesn't bring obvious benefit.
Bitcoin's benefits over legacy are 1. anonymity and ability to avoid capital controls, 2. security

The majority of the work is on non-bitcoin blockchains.  The majority of blockstream's man-hours are spent, arguably, undermining bitcoin.

That's not what "centralized" means in this context.  It's viewed as a continuum.  Complete decentralization would mean no one mining authority controlling more than a trivial amount of hash power (say 1%).  Total centralization would indeed mean one single mining authority controlling everything.  But the focus on decentralization for bitcoin is most commonly in reference to a 51% attack.  So if one miner has roughly 50% of the hash power, we're very close to total centralization.  With one miner at 30%, we're very highly centralized etc.

No.  Holders don't influence the price.  Price is determined by the marginal buyer and seller.  If 99% of bitcoin holders and potential bitcoin buyers simply don't trade, the price could still go up 10x or fall 90% on the actions of the remaining 1%.  My argument is that the majority of money currently moving the bitcoin price (or failing to move it) is aware of the halvening.  No one is aggressively shorting bitcoin totally unaware of the halvening.

I like keeping a little distance between real life and internet life.
One thing to note - dynamic fees are a big improvement, but don't fully solve the problem when congestion spikes after you submit a transaction.  Additionally, very few wallets supported them at that point.  Still today, most software that consumers use to submit transactions don't facilitate RBF.

This a comically stupid comment and shows you have no idea how the banking system works.  The primary business of banks is performing credit analysis and extending loans (home loans, consumer loans, and business loans).  Bitcoin and recent FinTech has nothing to do with any of that. A reasonable statement would be: banks at the end of our generation will look a lot more like banks of our parents generation did.

No, you're still not getting it.  No adapting necessary.  The 1/3 of their business that can be disintermediated will be disintermediated.  And as we speak, they're laying off a small portion of their workforce and cutting costs.  But the 2/3 of their business that is core banking (what banks have been doing for 300 years), will persist relatively unchanged.

This is incorrect.  There have been many dictatorial countries that allowed you to leave whenever you wanted.  The dictatorship only applied to people who chose to live in that country.

Daily P&amp;L includes overhead.  This is simply separated into fixed and variable costs; nothing complicated.  
The massive capital investment is known as a "sunk cost", and it's common in business that you have to walk away from losses rather than throw good money after bad.  For example, let's say I build a huge factory to make a computer chip.  But that computer chip is rendered obsolete before the factory is even finished and no one will buy the product.  Would I continue investing money to produce chips that I can't sell?

As usual R0ach, is totally wrong because he doesn't understand basic economics.  All that matters is *marginal profit* of mining.  The nature of bitcoin as an investment is totally irrelevant.  No rational person would mine at a loss.  If they believe that bitcoin will be worth more in the future, it would make sense to simply use the money you'd be throwing away on mining and instead buy bitcoins.

These things ensure a bitcoin value of about $50 at current darknet volumes.  Most bitcoin fans don't view a million users as "success."  We want it to change the world.
@_date: 2016-04-01 15:32:35
This is totally incorrect.  Lots of people (myself included) had many transactions die in limbo.  The network became unusable for many of us.  We sure as hell noticed when we consumer payments never made it to us, and consumers noticed when we had to reach out to them and tell them their bitcoin payments failed.

This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of what banks do.  The primary purpose of banks is to perform credit analysis and extend loans.  If company starts doing this with bitcoins, they will be a bank, just a bank accepting bitcoin and extending bitcoin loans instead of a bank accepting USD and extending loans via USD.

Most hash power is controlled by a few businesses that operate very rationally.

The problem is when the fee is 10%+.  A lot of people want to implement bitcoin for microtransactions (like $0.50 to download a song), which means bitcoin has a 10% fee.

That's not what dictatorship or democracy means.  There are many dictatorial countries that allow you to leave.  You're living under dictatorship insofar as you choose to live there.

You're confusing authoritarianism for communism.  The two often go hand in hand, but authoritarianism can also be coupled with capitalism, socialism, and any other economic system.
Also Shrem explicitly facilitated money laundering; he broke simple laws.

Just earn fiat, then use it to buy bitcoin.
