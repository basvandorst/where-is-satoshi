I really appreciate your support. I really am.  Actually I have cried a lot out of this loss.(literally cried).
@_date: 2018-02-26 07:46:24
I greatly appreciate your suggestion.
10 days ago, Feb 16, CEX.IO said, "Your funds should have reached your bank account." and I don't get any money. it means there must be some errors. But CEX.IO keep saying "we sent money." No intention to recover my money. They might send my money to somewhere else.. To steal my money. If not, they should show the proof that they sent money.

Do you have any intention to give my 5500USD back???
At least you have to explain what went wrong with money transfer.
I DON'T GET ANY EXPLATION NOR MONEY FROM YOU UNTIL NOW!
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:09:04
Sorry, sir.

Hello, CEX.IO spokesman.
 
They are not doing anything other than saying "we sent money, but we can't provide any proof of transaction."
It is clear that there must be some problem or they are lying.
Could you give me logical explanation of the reason why CEX.IO can't provide any proof of transaction? If you can't, I should use a word far worse than 'irresponsibility'

Did you get your money?
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:07:53
Thank you so much......
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:24:56
Thank you for your advise. I hope I can get my money back, soon. I will update here.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:10:59
happy ending

I already reported this case to U.K. police (NFRC# 180202204185), 
I am keeping touch with them.
Law suit will cost additional cost, hence it would be my final choice.

20days??! Are you kidding??? How can you explain Mark Titcombe who is waiting for 37 working days without any proof?!!!!!!!?
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:42:37
 Feb 16, CEX.IO said "Your funds should have reach your bank account."  .. It is Feb 23 still no money and no email. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:24:12
*****update on 2018-03-06*************************
 I finally got a notification from my bank~!!
 I really appreciate you guys, You've supported me a lot.
 Thank you so much!!
@_date: 2018-02-26 07:25:58
I really hope so, But there are many victims....  They just insist that they sent money without any proof. How absurd!! This is true and I have a lot of proof! 
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:11:47
Despite of higher fee, the reason why people use CEX.IO is fiat withdraw function. 
what is the most important is customer trust.
they have to reinforce their finance team to regain their trust.
I will update their response and action, here.

Thanks, I hope so.

Can u give me the link?
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:01:48
Thanks, Sumthnxxtra.
It has been a month. but Feb 16, CEX.IO said "Your funds should have reach your bank account or be in the final stage to your bank account." and Until today(Feb 20)My bank confirmed that No money has been sent. It means there must be serious problem in bank transfer which is totally unacceptable.
I hope not they are doing this on purpose for a  SCAM.
@_date: 2018-02-25 08:38:19
Thank you so much..  
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:19:54
I will find a way.. thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:15:07
Like I wrote above, I asked receipt/transfer proof many times. But CEX.IO denied it saying absurd reason (I wrote their excuse above.) It is very stressful because they ignore most of my e-mail(That's reason why I write here) My bank confirmed that No money is coming. I had little hope..but it turned to dismay as I found other victims who lost their money in the exactly same way. 
I reported this case to London police. (NFRC# 180202204185)
Again, Thanks for your suggestion.

I empathically understand your loss since I have been through same situation. It seems CEX.IO really doesn’t care about customer’s financial loss and emotional pain attached to it. 
I emailed many many times appealing the agony I was suffering, but They simply ignored without batting an eye.
They wouldn’t complete your ticket if you just wait 
hence I recommend you to take following action.
1.Report to 
2.Take legal action
3.Post your case on as many social media as possible.
I hope these will help.
Oh. One more thing, Stay away from those mother fuckers once you get your money back.
