At least in BTC, the amount of transactions/s is very limited. The potential energy consumption scales with mining, and therefore with price while the TX/s is pretty much constantly limited at ~7/s.
Therefore, the energy/tx increases until the block size is bumped.

# Uncensored (mirror, copy, original)
In may 2015 /BTC-OTC/ scammed me and other 6 persons using bank transfer chargeback which led to my bank account being closed and all my funds frozen for 45 days. At the time BTC-OTC was one of the most reputable traders on Localbitcoins.
I shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - HERE also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK
Localbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket - HERE
Since then I've been actively trying to get my coins with no result receiving only one single reply on my support ticket in 8 months
When contacting Max on linkedin his reply was - HERE
When contacting Max on reddit his reply was - HERE nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.
I emailed Jeremias Kangas (CEO &amp; Founder of LBC) with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue.
Police official statement on my complaint - HERE
National Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.
After 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - HERE , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email HERE
I knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.
Almost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.
Reason I'm posting this is because there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.
Now I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at €10.000 to €15.000 for civil proceedings,
One of the lawyers stated that i should also be also eligible for BTC + BCH as per blogpost - HERE
Finnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court
If you are a victim of this or you can help please get in touch.

@_date: 2018-05-08 21:42:58
Also, it's pretty accurate to say that BCH operates since the genesis block with a very similar approach as described in the whitepaper.
Maybe we should see this as valid criticism and publish an updated version of the whitepaper that includes the major changes that were made?

In a hyperinflation, I wouldn’t expect “minimum wage”, which is an arbitrary value set by a government to keep up with inflation. It may take them a year to pass a law to update it, and when that’s done the currency already dropped more than bitconnect.

~~Capital gains~~ Private sales are untaxed if you don’t short-term invest (less than 1 year). At least that’s what my tax consultant told me.

I get that it’s probably true, legally. But — honestly — I think that’s bullshit. Coinbase fucked up, why should OP even have to do anything for them? Especially in crypto. Imagine they sent too much to OP’s withdraw address. Good luck getting that back. They’re a crypto bank at this point, and should be familiar with the concept of code is law.

It's two different perspectives. Which chain forked from which one is not objectively true.
And I have no idea where in the whitepaper you found "lightning network".
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:17:25
I didn't know that Lightning Network fixed the issues I mentioned, however I still don't see why you'd be able to really pay within seconds. As far as I know the money you have in a lightning channel isn't released until you close it. So, to make a complete transaction you'd still need to open, send, close.
I don't really see how sending transactions without value (only with a promise of value) makes it fast. You still need to claim it.
Is there an updated version of the whitepaper?
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:39:09
That's a good reason, but $10 is still most likely the reason why your bank isn't worried.
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:08:28
Interesting. If all you said is actually true then lightning seems decent.
Why doesn't it just replace the blockchain entirely? From what you said it sounds like there's no reason to ever use the blockchain.
Is there an updated version of the whitepaper?
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:35:56
190 millimeters is actually above average size.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:52:25


Same with lightning network, especially since it's actually make 180000 transactions (1 to open, 1 to "send", 1 to close).
I also don't think that on-chain scaling will be the ultimate solution, but honestly—having $50 transaction fees (would be $100 with lightning) doesn't seem like a good thing to me.


Never understood why it's an issue. Don't care either way TBH.


Well, I'm all for technological progress, but I don't see Lightning Network as a better technology, especially since it requires 2 transactions and incentivizes "hubs", aka. banks.
Feel free to prove me wrong/convince me. I'm open for anything that's objectively true.
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:40:37


@_date: 2018-04-27 21:47:26
All I'm saying is that BCH is closer to the Bitcoin that's described in the whitepaper. I also don't see any reason why on-chain scaling is bad, especially in the short-term.
In addition to that, so far nobody has managed to convince me that Lightning Network is actually a good thing. It may be bias, but I only see its problems (centralization incentives, having to use two on-chain transaction fees instead of one).
As I don't consider myself to be an irrational person, feel free to convince me that bumping the block size is a bad solution, especially in the short-term.

Margin longing in March would’ve made my portfolio value go negative. Margin shorting it now means that I borrow money to predict that the price goes down even more, after it already went down ridiculous amounts in the last year.
