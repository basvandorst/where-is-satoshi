I actually sell POS systems, so I would first check if ur pos supports second currency option that you would assign to bitcoins. This is important for reports. As for number 3 you can get a tablet with a stand and hook it up to bitpay or coinbase account. You probably won't be able to integrate it with our existing pos, so will ring up a cash transaction in second currency and then input dollar value on the tablet to generate qr code. I based in NYC so you can PM me for help.

Wow, good for them.

Newegg is expanding to UK, that's the most likely explanation. Currency option is probably for pounds and euros.

Price of Vx510 is much much less than coinkite terminal

I have no problem with Bank of America business checking and bicoin. But they have fees if ur account balance go below 5k.

None of the most common POS systems fully support bicoin. The only option is to get a tablet and integrate it with coinbase or bitpay. As for pos any will do as long as it has second currency option.

SoftTouch has a very small market share compared to Aloha or Micros for example. Aloha has about 22% market share and Micros has about 15%, the rest is less than 1%.

I am very interested, I am in POS business. I can help with distribution.

We sell point of sale systems with bitcoins. There is no markup. In general, most of suppliers operate on Net terms, so no need to covert bitcoins to fiat right away.

Awesome, let me know if you have any ideas on how to market it to businesses,
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:44:50
Not sure about Aloha, but POSs that we offer to our customers have second currency option. This way you can assign Bitcoin to be a second currency. After that you will treat it as cash payment and go to the customer with your phone or tablet to process the payment using a QR code.

Yes, but if it goes up you are making more :) There is always a risk. On the other hand Bitcoin has no chargebacks unlike credit cards. If you calculate the percentage of so called friendly fraud, i say Bitcoin is less risky than credit cards.

We sell pcAmerica. It doesn't have the option to get current exchange rates though.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:50:47
This is a great idea. We'll see what we can do.

Technically they won't be shares, but bonds. On order to sell bonds I believe you have to register with SEC. You should try to raise money for your business using conventional ways such as SBA loans or family and friends.

Don't mind my cat hair :)

Unless I am missing something BitPay only guarantees the exchange rate at the checkout not at the point of the ACH to bank account. If I am wrong I would love to see a link stating otherwise.

Great idea, my POS company is actually looking into bitcoin. We will definately participate.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:18:07
At this point the only way to use bitcoin in conjunction to dinerware is second currency. This way it will show up accurately on the reports.

You will have loyal customers in our startup and we can help with point of sale if you need one.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:12:41
Appreciate the offer, the best way to help is to raise awareness among businesses and consumers. And you can always reach out to us.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:02:53
Yeah same here, not much movement is going on. That's why we are trying to introduce bitcoin to our local merchants.
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:15:53
You can look up Coinkite, they are located in Toronto
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:33:23
You are right, but when you withdraw the funds into the bank account the price of bitcoin can drop lower than the price at the checkout. If a processor will guarantee the price at the end of the day it will give merchants a piece of mind.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:35:01
Guess u just summed up the main challenge of businesses to accept bitcoin. Price fluctuations are too great at this point. Merchants want stability and guarantee that if the sold hot dogs for $100.00 that what they will see in the bank account the next day minus the fees. Today no bitcoin processor can guarantee that.

The whole point of the article was not as much Bitcoin, but how much money companies make of selling rigs.
