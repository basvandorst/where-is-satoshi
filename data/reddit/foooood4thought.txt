You people really are stupid.
Think of all the slow, steady, reality-based investments and projects you could be investing your time into.
And instead, you buy into something which crashes from $20k to $10k in 1 month.

Yes, well that's because with the USD, banks can actually afford to lend you money in the first place.
Overdrafts can actually exist because it makes sense to loan people money when a currency is stable in value.
With Bitcoin and loans.... well.... hmm... just give this a read....

Well, I should say, I never got into any kind of long-term investing, because I thought I would always panic and sell early.
And why would I do such a thing?
Because it's normal for a security to rise by 10% per year, not by 50% in one week.
That's why.
I try to do things in life that I can predict. I don't play these stupid gimmicks.
I knew about Bitcoin all the way back when it cost $5 USD.
I didn't buy it, because I figured I would just sell when it hit $20 or something.
I don't regret it at all, because I definitely would have sold early.
Loads of tough guys on the Internet will claim that they bought and held for years. I think a small number maybe had the guts. I certainly wouldn't have done.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:06:37


Yes! They absolutely are!
The normal stock market might get 10-20% **per year**, and over the last 40 years, it's been an average of around 8% per year.
50% in a few days is just batshit stupid.

That would put the market cap at over $1 trillion.
Bitcoin, worth as much as Apple.
A ridiculous joke. It's already worth way too much and should go back to about a $50 million market cap realistically.

It really depends whether you think Bitcoin is a currency, or whether it's the new gold.
If it's the new gold, then yes, it can rise a lot.
If it's actually a currency, then it stands literally zero chance of ever succeeding.
Just read this recent Forbes article to understand why...




@_date: 2017-12-17 12:43:56
What if... we think Bitcoin is going to crash, but we don't know when, or to what value.
So why on Earth would I put my money where my mouth is..?
That's the whole point of a speculative bubble... it's totally irrational and unpredictable.
You wouldn't want to bet on it rising, and you also wouldn't want to bet on it falling.
You simply wouldn't want to bet on it, period.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:27:13
Rising by 50% in a few days isn't something to celebrate.
It is a sign that Bitcoin is a freaking joke.
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:15:26
So a certain extent, you should be glad that this happened, because they forced you to HODL, and now your coins are worth a lot more.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:10:09
Everybody will be like Greg because you have no idea how high the price might go.
The only way to not be like Greg is to have bought Bitcoin and then totally forgotten about it, and then discovered their wallet years later.
Even then, it depends how many years later.
Forget predicting prices. No one can do it.

If Thiel really believed this, he would invest more than $15 to $20 million....


@_date: 2018-03-10 19:08:11
Holy shit. They're not only using "Bitcoin Core" to describe BTC, but also now using "Bitcoin" to describe Bitcoin Cash.
They're not even using "Bitcoin Cash" anymore. They are now just literally calling their invention "Bitcoin"..
Holy shit.... I didn't believe this at first... But they are really playing some sort of sick trick here.
What this should tell you... is that Bitcoin mining isn't very profitable.... and attempting to buy the lows and sell the highs isn't very profitable either.
The only way to make good money from Bitcoin is to pump your own coin by pretending to be another coin by stealing its name.
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:10:09
How can this possibly be true?
If Bitcoin goes up and down like crazy, then why would anyone hold it for any period of time...? You risk losing loads of money if the price goes down, for example, dropping recently from $20,000 to as low as $7,000 or so. 
Even if Bitcoin ever rises to $20,000 again... how long will this take...? It's already been months... So what happens if you need to pay bills in this time... while you are waiting for it to hit $20,000 again...? Will your landlord or loan company or mortgage company just let you off the hook..? Because they think the price may rise to $20,000 again, so they'll just take your Bitcoins, and not worry about the dollar losses...?
How completely and utterly **ridiculous**.
It could only ever be used in between the dollar, in which case, you are going through Visa/Mastercard/your Bitcoin exchange/the banking system in order to even convert your dollars to and from Bitcoin.
There is simply no way Bitcoin can ever overtake the dollar, unless close to 100% of all dollars were converted into Bitcoins.
And if you think that is going to happen... you are utterly INSANE.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:37:02
It was always going to involve going through the existing payments system, in order to buy Bitcoin.
This is why I have always said that Bitcoin is going to fail. You have to use dollars, or Visa, or Mastercard to buy it. Therefore they can just hit you with fees.
That's not even mentioning the fees that Bitcoin exchanges themselves have usually charged. I remember using Bitstamp and it had a 0.5% fee.
The truth is that cryptocurrency can only truly be revolutionary if it is completely divorced from the existing financial system altogether.
Something like each person given free money that is a cryptocoin and it's distributed equally or something like that.
Either that, or you have to buy Bitcoin through a personal relationship with some person who already has Bitcoin, and then they are often scammers, like sending someone money in the post with cash and they promise to convert it to Bitcoin and not just steal it.
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:42:13
Holy shit. Now the Bitcoin people have entered a completely new world of delusion.
If you would call this "stable", just wow. It's just totally denying reality.

This is article is total bullshit. The website Bitcoin.com clearly differentiates between the 2 Bitcoins. It clearly shows 2 different prices at the top. BTC is even listed first before Bitcoin Cash.
They use the correct BTC and BCH symbols.
To say that this is some trick to make you think you're buying Bitcoin is just flat-out wrong. It's idiotic.
I think using "Bitcoin" would be better than "Bitcoin Core", but ultimately it's not a big deal.
I doubt that the goal is to trick customers.
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:55:31
It's all irrelevant because who has the guts to buy in 2010 and sell in 2018?
You would see it rising loads, then panic sell.
Or you'd see it falling loads, and panic sell.
It's not a straight line up from 2010 to 2018.
Even if it were a straight line, you wouldn't expect it to go up so much, so you'd probably sell at a 2x, 3x profit, and you'd probably only put in a few $1,000 at the most, because who trusts their life savings with a stupid cryptocoin..??
But whatever.... just imagine some massive profits, and keep investing in this stupid crap.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:58:23




Not necessarily.
Because people can have fake gold.
So you would need the technology to be able to verify that it's real gold.

You people are insane. 272 upvotes for this shit?
Oh yeah, I'm just going to the store to buy some candy with my $5 transaction fee.
I'm just going to buy some A4 paper with my $5 transaction fee.
I'm just going to buy a new phone charger with my $5 transaction fee.
Holy shit. No wonder the price goes from $20,000 down to $6,500. I'm surprised it's that high.
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:29:06


No. Because you will sell it early.
Just like the early adopters.
They likely bought at $1, and sold at $5.
Or bought at $10, and sold at $50.
Nobody has the guts to buy at $1, and sell at $5,000.
If you have the guts to do that, then you truly will be rich.... or, you will just wait around and nothing will ever come.
Or, worse still you will wait around, the price will crash entirely.
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:24:34
Yes, because Putin always makes wise decisions.
Basing an entire economy on oil, and then the price tanks.
And then stupidly invading Crimea and getting loads of sanctions slapped on you.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:47:33
Some people will manipulate/scam the markets and temporarily push the price to $50,000... and manage to actually sell a few coins worth at this price... and then it will crash all the way down to $6,000 again.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:26:57


Dude... Just re-read over that sentence, realise that you're investing in a scammy cryptocurrency, stop trying to be so virtuous.... and just **take the damn billion**
This isn't a troll post.
I am telling you to enjoy these profits for the rest of your life.
I want you to read my post **very, very carefully**.
Bitcoin is a scam mostly used by Russian mafia and organised crime to launder money.
It has no value, and one day, governments will probably just shut it down.
Just take your money while you can.
Don't be like many other Internet entrepreneurs and lose all your money because you didn't get the right advice.
I am giving you the right advice now... Take the damn money.
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:01:44
Well then.. the Evening Standard has Bitcoin prices listed.
Now the price **must** go up.
Clinging to every little straw here... every little bit of news.
Just give it up.
You can't buy things using Bitcoin when the price fluctuates so much.
No one will ever loan you any money in such an unstable currency, where they will get less money back for their loan, or more, depending on which random person decided to manipulate the price today.
What gives the dollar any value at all.... is having the entire weight of a nation state behind it.... the fact that it's so big in the first place.. that so many dollars have been created/"printed".
With so many dollars in circulation, it's very hard to manipulate the market.
Even Bill Gates selling all his dollars on the forex market would barely move the value of the dollar.
Bitcoin on the other hand... far too many have been mined in such a short time period... and they all went much easier to the initial miners... so it's very easy for a few big players to manipulate the price.
And once all the coins are mined, you can't just print more Bitcoins to stabilise any price fluctuations... The limit on supply is going to mean wild demand with unchanging supply.... and this can therefore create a highly unstable price.

This graph just shows you why you will never make any money investing in Bitcoin or anything else.
i.e.... you never know where the top and bottom is, so you will always buy too late, or sell too early. You will never buy at the lowest low and sell at the highest high. It will always be some fraction somewhere in the middle, maybe shaving off a little profit, but just as likely to buy in at a bad time, watch it fall, panic and sell.
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:25:30
Yeah, man, it'll just keep going up forever, after it crashes.
This has happened before, and therefore, it must keep happening. Forever.
