I hope that by "has offered his Bitcoin exchange’s services" Andre Horta actually means "without any fees", otherwise it's pure marketing.

That doesn't mean it's not a phishing attempt. If gox database had hashed passwords that means they didn't have your password. Thus, they could show you a page like this using the same password verification method and the same accounts database but logging the plaintext passwords every time you try them and whenever the hashes match they now have your credentials.

Gox database was stolen, they know everything except your plaintext password and this is exactly what it would take to get it.

If I read it correctly they say "6. Bill Payment Service Fees and Our Exchange Rate. While we do not charge fees for our Bill Payment Services" in  
I don't see how not charging fees equals charging it.

What about being polite to this guy:  
Nobody supports your shit anymore.

Wrong, that doesn't mean it's not a phishing attempt. Gox database was hacked and if it had hashed passwords that means they didn't have your password. Thus, they could show you a page like this using the same password verification method and the same accounts database but logging plaintext passwords every time you try them and whenever the hashes match they now have your credentials.

But what if you want to buy a Macbook and it costs 2.7 million Boivars?

It's irrelevant if Bitcoin is super secure when you have a physical key stored somewhere safe and you're not spending any of it. The moment you start typing passwords and moving coins around you're taking the same risk as someone using a credit card, even more risk because if you get stolen you won't get a refund.

I mean nobody needs to hack EMV chips to commit credit card fraud. All you need to buy something with someone else's credit card online is some personal information, numbers and codes, that's even more than you need to spend someone else's bitcoin. The focus of thieves is on people and whatever weak links you have around the technology not the technology per se.

Oh, but you don't need to hack a wallet do you? Just as you don't need to hack any credit card technology to commit fraud. That's what I meant by irrelevant. It can be as unbreakable and inherently secure as possible, but if you don't actually need to break it then what's the point?

Here's a resume of what happened: pinkbtc1 is a SCAMMER. You have nothing wrong with your computer right now, you just sent him all of your BTC in a scam :(
He tried that with me asking to exchange his BTC for LTC (I said I have to check it was a scam). Then he gave me a blockchain wallet login and password saying he had 39BTC and that sending his login info was all I needed to trust him. 
Soon I realized his wallet had another e-mail and user info and also the 39 bitcoins there were only information collected from "watch only addresses", meaning he had no private keys for them. 
I then IP blocked him from his own wallet and deleted the whole thing.

I'm really sorry for your loss, the internet is full of this shit.

I feel you. My money is frozen right now at the exchange and I couldn't buy it at $950.
