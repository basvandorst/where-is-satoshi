Easy answer, each to his own. Gold is for the rich, not for the common man. I am common, and prefer Bitcoin. By the people for the people. Gold has only every been associated with the wealthy, in all the wrong ways.

Maybe you are younger than me. I don't need that security; I refuse to pay silly money for over priced houses, that are not worth the money in the first place. It's each to his own, but having given all that up,  I have never been happier. I own everything I have, I have money in the bank, and I care not for the feeling of ownership. I used to think it was all important, but that's because I had bought into the paradigm. Truth is if it's on payments, you can't afford it. Meanwhile you are just feeding into the FIAT money creation system. But, it's each to his own, just my opinion is all. I also chose not to have kids, so it's just me and freedom. Next month I sell my company and drop out altogether, I am 57 and really don't give a fuck anymore. Just doing my own thing, been a slave to debt my whole life, thinking I was getting ahead. \[ For the same reason the whole world is in debt, because we can't afford it \] Then realised that being in debt is not getting ahead, there is no getting ahead, we all end up in the same place at the last call. Biggest mistake I ever made. One life, and it's not worth getting on credit. Go forth and prosper :)

That's probably because you think a company means money. It will give me enough to live on for around 2 years. After that, I don't care. I have a little Bitcoin, and hope that does well. But if not then I shall see then. Like I say each to his own, I am going my own way, rather than with the masses :)

Just to be clear, I only owed two debts, my car, and my house. I sold the house, paid off the car, bought a motorcycle, and paid off what I owed on the house. Most excellent. What I had left I gambled on Bitcoin, which has been ok, in no way enough to live on, but I have faith. Now I have a car that is paid for, along with my bike \[ for going around europe on \] and I rent where I live, which is in a place I could never have afforded any other way. It's not posh, it's just a bungalow in the countryside, that was built in the 70's. But it's all I need. If I lost the house, I would buy a van, and cut my costs right down. I have worked my whole life, but a lot of that went on interest payments especially on cars, which I kept renewing every three years, to make myself feel better about the job I hated. Anyway, enough of this, not lying, come over and stay, and I can tell you my story. I came from nothing, no parents, no background money, just made my own way. Left school at 14 etc etc ... No fear, one life :)

Don't borrow any money. The reason trucks and houses are on payments, is because you can't afford them. They need you to borrow money, in order to create money. All money is created in debt. Once you realise how money is created \[ youtube it \] then you will stop ever wanting to borrow it. Best thing I ever did was get out of debt and live within my means. I sold my house \[ as I could have never paid it off \] used the money to clear any debts I had, and now I rent. That was around 4 years ago, now I only spend what I can afford. But since then, not every week, but every month certainly, I save some money by buying Btc. And have not made a fortune, but I have made a profit. Dollar cost averaging and dump the house and truck.

Totally agree. The point of me posting it was to show just that, it's the Stocks and Stock Market that is the Ponzi scheme, not Bitcoin as some banksters have said. Apologies if I posted in the wrong place. Just thought it was good education for people standing on the sidelines.
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:09:39
I found it interesting and posted it here, as Bitcoin is often called a ponzi scheme which it is not. I guess you must have read the book to comment on it?

I know that one gets me. I think they just don't get it and only see the cash in their eyes. Many out there have no idea that they are being shafted by the banks and have been for hundreds of years. They just want 'stuff' .. Bitcoin is many things and one of those is a principle. Once the fiat domino's start to collapse, people may, if they are lucky, wake up.
@_date: 2019-11-20 13:42:25
Absolutely. Bitcoin stops this kind of theft, and every other type of banker / gov cartel theft.

I think the demand in utility will be the driving force for price discovery. I currently hodl because I have no intention to cash back into FIAT. When I can use Btc for purchases I do. So as more people start accepting Btc for purchasing, then the value will rise surely? And if not rise, then find it's natural price. 
Also people can gain Btc by the acceptance of it for their goods. In fact it's an easy way to get hold of Btc if you don't have the funds to buy it outright. So basically to me, it's about adoption, and I believe that will come as various parties make it easier to onboard, and also spend on goods. 
1 Btc = 1 Btc it's always been the same. FIAT \[ dollar \] has lost 97&amp; of it's value over the last 50 years, so we are down to the last 3 &amp; of value. It's going down like the proverbial woman working in a house of ill repute.
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:34:47
All this FUD and nonsense is just practice for a prize fighter. If Bitcoin can't deal with this, then it can't work. Bitcoin is a protocol, it is not affected by the weather or FUD. Bitcoin don't care ! 
I buy a little whenever I can. Not interested in the politics or the price or a thousand Bitcoin trading Youtube Videos. 
And to help out a little, I run a full node.
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:07:48
Totally with you on that. No intension of cashing into Fiat. When Btc goes up past 50k many places will start accepting it. Been in a long time, and not going anywhere.

Roger Ver to me is just a central banker now. Determined to corrupt the market, manipulate the space - and like all bankers - profit at any one's expense and at any cost. Moving his coins around just proves this point. Money corrupts, and boy has he been corrupted!
@_date: 2019-12-31 08:11:11
Both of then are the Kings of money laundering. Tax enforcement, you mean theft? Thankfully Bitcoin has no interest in what these corrupt elitist's think. Bitcoin is already way ahead of these fossils and all they can do now is make noises about it. I think this year will be the year of regs from what I am hearing, but I care not for their regs any longer. Not while they always favour the rich and not the poor.
@_date: 2019-12-10 10:34:23
Personally I don't think Bitcoin cares. If it did, then what use is it? It's outside of 'their' system. Adopt it or don't , Bitcoin don't care, and never will.

If he wants to know about money laundering he should speak with HSBC. They love laundering drug cartel money and have been caught twice now. A small fine \[ for them \] and they just carry on, no one goes to prison, just business as usual. There is only one reason they hate bitcoin. They can't control it, it's that simple.

Because the Fiat system is collapsing, and it's time to take back our sovereignty from the banking cartels that have taken over our lives. With their fractional reserve banking  practices they have continually devalued any 'money' you thought you had. Think of it this way. If you borrowed $100 from the bank and only paid them back $10 how much did they lose? Nothing, they gained $10, as the money they lent you was never there in the first place. Inflation is now becoming very evident because of their haphazard attempt to keep the ball rolling by printing more money. Things are not getting more expensive, your money is becoming worthless ... worth less. Btc is taking your future back from the bankster goverment cartel that have created this mess. Simple.

I know of 7 people in a row, including myself, who have to wait 72 hours every time you move Btc off Coinbase. I get that security is important, but 7 different accounts, moving Btc to ledger devices which is what they normally do, is a bit strange. I presume they have Btc in cold storage, and when enough people want to move it off the exchange, they fulfil  the order. They say it's security related, but I don't believe that now.

As the big Bitcoin players start buying banks, then the off and on ramps will become more and more slick. With Mastercard saying they are looking at some kind of FIAT/Crypto space in their system, the tide is turning, if not turned already. These dinosaurs are just whistling into the wind.

From the time when the Bank of England was formed in 1694, it took over 300 years for banks to create the first trillion pounds. It took only 8 years for banks to create the second trillion. So I think it's time Mr Bis to settle down, and eat your popcorn. That bright shiny light in the sky coming towards you is not the sun, it's Bitcoin.

FIAT is collapsing. Every FIAT currency in the world has collapsed. The difference this time is that the whole world is using FIAT. Once people wake up to that, they will start putting money into something better like Bitcoin. Add to that negative interest rates, and people generally starting to wake up to the realisation that happiness is not found in buying things, then it makes better sense to stack sats. Does any of it matter? No, it is what it is. Bitcoin is already successful, and does not need institutions to make it great. All that has to happen is to let the 'experts' completely screw up the current system, which as we can see, they are doing. Inflation is happening, things are not getting more expensive, your FIAT is becoming worth less I.E worthless.

These guys brought me to Btc with their criminal activity, backed up by their political crime cartels. 2008 was when everything changed, except the bankers. They have continued to steal money off the people and line their pockets. I can only think of them now in terms of legacy bankers, just like legacy media, and legacy social media .. Decentralised, censorship resistant, anti fragile, borderless, permission\-less Btc has all that and more. It's a mind set.
