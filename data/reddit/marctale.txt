Because you need a separate on/off button like your computer has. The power button on the EVGA is not enough. The EVGA would only work in a computer. Just put your EVGA in the computer and use that to power the miner.
... and yes. Wrong sub.

I read about Bitcoin in 2013. I was about to mine it (I had enough computers, CPU's back then) to mine around 4-5 a day. Then I did a little research here on reddit (I was not a member then) where most people wrote it already reached it's highest potential and would only go down...

Interesting. German newspapers claim What's app will soon introduce BTC, not a Facebook coin...

That's why the ;)        ;)

You're right. It must have been earlier than that. Could have been 2010 or 2011. No need to be sorry though... :)

Interesting they're showing the Kia Optima but no price for it...

I literally dreamt of the moon last night. It was very close to earth (for whatever reason). However in the dream it was not a good thing (think last "Time Machine" movie...).
I hope the end is better here ;)

There's no 3549 in the table above. I guess you mean 3945... ;)

Even if this is for real. You shouldn't have that much in one single account. You might get flagged and then blocked from spending...

So you need 50 sats or 5? You wrote 2 different things here. 0.0280455 - 0.0280450 != 0.00000005. It's actually 0.00000050.

I believe they only talk about wallets actually used on these specific das for transactions - not all wallets in existence. That would not work since I alone used more BTC (thanks to blockchain changing wallets every transaction) since then.

[blockchain.com]( also offers purchase of BTC.

This part is key here. 
Financial institutions don't make money. FED makes no money. Government makes no money. 
That would make it an attack on FIAT and the government. And that's how they see it.

Don't sell BTC. Use them. You can pretty much buy everything with BTC nowadays. And if a store/company/place doesn't accept BTC, ask them to add BTC. That way accumulation happens faster and BTC worth more and more.
Do your part (where's that Startroopers meme?)...

In New York (and many other cities in the US that have a checkered street system) you always say the corner of 2 streets so people know fairly exactly where it is. Especially helpful for cab drivers who don't want to hear an exact address and don't want to mess around with block numbers which sometimes are also illogical.
Hope it helped.

TA charts... lol.... The most useless things in Crypto.

Agreed. BTC is the slowest rising Coin in my Portfolio of 8. While BTC went up around 50% others rose up to 320%.

"Deposit of 0.05 BTC needed." on an exchange alone screams scam.
@_date: 2019-05-28 23:11:02
It varies. In NYC there are also streets with real names (like Lexington). But if you say 1st and 1st the cab driver knows where to go. If you say 6th an 9th he needs to know which is the Avenue (North/South) and which is the Street (East/West) although usually Avenue comes first.
I'm European and it's tricky at first but you get used to it.
