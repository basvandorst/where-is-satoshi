Bitcoin is the low functioning one?
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:18:55
It's sad how people think this is a low fee.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:56:33
In what way
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:47:23
Then what is it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:35:36
But most of time its because a thread is talking about laws or some shit like that and then they feel the need to correct everyone, this is the same with everyone else not living in the US.

That's not the point. You're not poor because you're smart and neither are you rich if you're dumb. Was just pointing out that Forrest didn't get rich because he was superior or something like this post is trying to imply but because he got lucky.

A retarded guy but a very lucky one?

Theres plenty of stories of peoples bank accounts getting terminated because of bitcoin usage. Even worse if youre using their system to automate it.

But the government dont wanna admit that usd is used in more cases of money laundering compared to cryptocurrencies. Thats the problem. They just say Its used by terrorists and drugs. If you provide a service where users can get bitcoin on their hands the buy drugs you will/can get jailed, but banks wont (even tough they provide the most used currency for crime), thats what ridiulous.
Proof: ["The bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem has been sentenced to two years in jail for his part in a money laundering scheme, after a bitcoin exchange he ran was found to be aiding users of the Silk Road black market."](

crypto in general is much more volatile in this time and space...
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:57:45
No, everyone will be scared of it not going up again, and everyone would try to sell to not lose to much money.
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:03:50
But you cant new bitcoin forever
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:48:02
Who cares if he has the willpower to run across the country instead of using a vehicle? That´s just stupid and inefficient (like bitcoin). If he wasn't stupid he would've of used another vehicle (another crypto instead of a slow and inefficient bitcoin) instead.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:06:39
Lmao you dont work at that point
