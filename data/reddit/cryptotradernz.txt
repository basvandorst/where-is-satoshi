Ummm... it's impossible for governments to control the blockchain; no-one can since it is a distributed ledger run by millions of computers spread all around the world. So your theory is a load of bollocks!

Trying to centralise Bitcoin.... can't work no matter how you look at it!

That's the recovery phrase. What wallet are you using? Sounds like you will be OK. Give it a few days...

BTC - Up a bit (before the fork), then down a bit (after the fork), then up a lot!
BCH - Down a bit, down a bit more, down a lot more!

Your bcc will be in a bitfinex bcc wallet when it is there. I would hope that exchanges are ready to push the button straight away but more than 1 hour and I would be disappointed. Got my Trezor ready hoping the bcc wallet will show soon...

Is multibit still supported? May need to create a paperwallet first and go from there...

Segwit 2x is coming later on in bitcoin legacy blockchain. This is big blockers throwing their toys out...

Do you know your private key?
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:37:39
Yes. For the next 40 minutes and as long as you buy on an exchange that supports bcc.

Know your private key

Ideally you need to get your btc to an offline wallet like jaxx or electrum in the next 30 mins... the blockchain will record that you have btc in a wallet at the time of the split but you need to at least know your private key...

This and the fact that Bitcoin is considered a legal currency in Japan as of today in my view is playing a big part in the current hike in BTC price

Triple Entry Accounting huh? Who would've known!!! I mean it's obvious now but nowhere in my entire experience of blockchain articles have I ever read about Yuji Ijiri. As I am just starting to organise blockchain bitcoin and crypto tutorials and seminars for beginners this article sums it up perfectly. Although there are grammatical errors and the obvious date issue right at the beginning, it needs to be as long as it is to get even a small snippet of the picture across. This is a very accessible article which gives a deep insight to another facet of the blockchain which just helps to cement my belief in this revolution even further - if that's possible! Donating some btc to that! Bravo!
Edit: Tried donating but couldn't find anywhere to do it! Purely a charitable document from Mr Dan Jeffries - respect!
