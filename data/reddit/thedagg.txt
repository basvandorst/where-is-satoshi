Wrong - Have you just been looking at American's response?!?! Look at Japan's, Korea's, and China's. You think Japan wants Bitcoin, now accepted as a currency, to be controlled by Axa and lose power of control?! Hell know, they know the value of switching to Bitcoin Cash down the road if the price becomes feasible.

Good call buddy

It was trading at $500 yesterday when you could have officially sold. So you would have made 20 cents on the dollar, not much if you didn't have many BTC. HUGE if you had a significant amount.

Smart man - Hope you've made some money the last couple days, it's been a wild ride!

As of today 80% of the world economy honored the fork and are accepting the coin. Yes, the world is buying it. Only reason it's not plummeting in price, we just don't see the value that the Chines and Japanese do.

How much gold would you like? Or send me your trading address - I think the point of your post was to further the spending of BTC, which I would like to continue by passing the BTC to you directly rather than give you a badge paid for in fiat. We both know the bank will immediately sell it for fiat, or hoard it - Either way they won't treat it as a currency.  
I'll give you gold now so you get the recognition you deserve in this forum, but you should also have a donation address!

That is why this sub has become toxic in nature, it's has become a group of "yes men" constantly validating each other's greed. The latecomers always are in it for the wrong reasons, not like the pioneers like you that care for it from the roots up.
You are spot on - Satoshi could read this, and be proud.
