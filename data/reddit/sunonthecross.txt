How do we know he/she isn't? God it's a crazy world out there!

Well I don't know where to begin with the sadness of your comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:06:03
Well that's all right then.

Well don't wait until you think the times right. You'll be staring across barbed wire by fences by then. Plenty of precedence.

I thought you all had guns in the US?

So which problems does it solve that requires the country to have so many? Genuine question.

I'm asking you to explain this in a way that can be understood. Because I don't understand it.

Thanks for the Primer, it's very helpful. What I'm interested in more than the trading end is how it can become useful to me in an everyday sense? You gave an example there but could you elaborate on why I might/should make use of it from that perspective? I trade Football Exchanges so I have enough to keep me interested and entertained in that context, so really interested in practical uses. Thanks.

What are you talking about? Sounds like double Dutch to me. Explain it like I'm 5 and give me good analogies and illustrations please.

ELI5 please. Sounds funky. I need to know more!

Appreciate that. I'm familiar with Cytpocurrency and the main ideas behind it but for sure there are elements in just not aware of or understand. I've been interested in it though since the beginning and enjoy following some of the conversations around it, so any additional info is welcomed.
