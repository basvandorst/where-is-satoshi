LMAO!!! I will tell you what have this conversation 2 years ago on thanksgiving this pic is perfect! Today it still holds true but I think there is a little better understanding of digital currencies these days. Great meme regardless! Happy Thanksgiving.

Just color it red and it will look like a bitcoin candlestick chart since June!

I mean  it has been consistently  going down since June. I don’t see it going back up anytime soon. Next year some time maybe. Hold of for now you’ll have a better buying opportunity.

Is litecoin ever a buy? I mean should I some now at $55 or wait for $30 ? Should I never buy litecoin at all? What does everyone think?
@_date: 2019-09-22 21:08:30
I don't totally understand it. I know that there can only be a certain amount of coins ever right?

Nice! The future of food truck payments

Lol  yes perhaps you are right. I kind of realized that when I was finished but I figured I typed it all mine as well put it out there.

I agree with you. I have '"zoomed out" and I must say I have seen exactly what you apparently have as well. I think that bitcoin is here to stay and if you look back on the chart since inception it technically looks like a break out soon. That being said the past does not need to repeat itself. This is why people are so nervous about an asset like this. Technical charts are great and I love it but its nice to have some fundamentals and the fact is bitcoin just doesn't have any.

Maybe you didn't see the punctuation?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:00:08
NO!!!!! Please don't just jump in because its down. How do you know its going to stop going down once you get in? Look for some price levels, take in the current news of the day and understand the overall sentiment of what you are about to just throw your money into. I would say wait until it hits at least $7200, see what happens from there.

I have to say, I don't want to tell you how to trade, if you got in at 4.2 and it went up to 13.0 and you didn't cash out you were asking for this. I mean maybe not your entire position but I hope you took some profit. I don't know what you should do at this point. If you hang on and it gets back down to 7.2 and then falls below that, just sell. If you got out at 7.2 that would still be 41.7% profit. I think if you hold on to it for the long run you'll be good, might be a wild run to the finish line though

Going down to at least $7200
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:58:56
Yea that doesn't look sketchy at all!

I didn't say anything about [stamps.com]( I will say to the point I believe you are trying to make. If you compare stocks to bitcoin, then yes, stonks as you call them are better. Bitcoin goes up and down and you have absolutely have no idea why. If you can tell  me what makes bitcoin fluctuate in price every day, I'll concede to you. Bitcoin along with currencies that the world already accepts move daily and people don't always know why. Stocks are a ownership in something. The company you own makes a product or provides a service and that product or service makes money. When they make money or lose money they tell you in a nicely wrapped and bowed quarterly report. You can use these reports to determine if they are going to make more money or if you believe they might not. That said I actually like bitcoin a lot. I think it should be part of every ones portfolio. That doesn't mean at this time its better or worse than anything.

Id say get used to it,for the short term at very least

Best technical drawing tool ever used for bitcoin chart.

People you need to stop comparing bitcoin to stocks. Bitcoin and stocks are not the same at all. When a stock goes down lets use AAPL as an example. This company is one of the biggest and best out there and you can understand why without ever have even graduated 8th grade. This company has had the best phone product (arguably) for  the last 10 years. They are now getting more into the service end of their business. You can read 10Q and 10k reports and evaluate the company with fundamentals. Can you do any of that with bitcoin? The answer is no. You can not be sure of anything with bitcoin. So to your post. The fact is that you really don't know if you're buying a dip or just a straight up down trend.
