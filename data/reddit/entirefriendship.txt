But bitcoin users do.

It is funny that a simple bug fix has to be implemented in a super convoluted way and it takes several years before a significant part of the userbase accepts it.

... you’ll die forgotten in a swamp hovel?

Those numbers are rubbish. Bitcoin mining consumes several GW of electric power, which means the yearly energy consumption is at least 30 million GJ, maybe several times that.

Ron Paul is a racist old fool who has no understanding of economics whatsoever.

Why is this a problem?

A self-serving just-so story isn’t historically accurate???

Sort of, all the transactions are broadcast to the entire network.

PoW mining is and will remain a crime against nature. No amount of magical thinking will change that fact.
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:24:34
So never :(
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:43:42


Not a word about voluntarity there, except the ones you apparently imagine.
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:27:12
Actually it’s quite possible to lose.
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:04:40


No and no. You’ve misunderstood the whole system.


Why do you think this is a good idea that would help future generations? The vast majority of efficiency improvements and indeed the resources themselves are based on technological improvements. The technological output of the society is more or less proportional to its economical output, which you hope to stall.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:33:52
I'm probably gonna regret this but I have to ask: That “mr redditor for 6 weeks” sounded like you think it’s an insult. Surely it’s better than having been a redditor for more than 6 weeks?
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:00:58
It’s called creeptocurrency for a reason...
@_date: 2018-08-25 23:43:21
And bitcoin has been captured by a Wall St. fatcat.
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:42:55


How deluded can you get?
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:48:44
The easy solution is to swap the reddits.
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:31:26
Bitcoin already is synonymous with conspiracy nutters.
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:07:11


This is patent nonsense, and I have no idea how people come up with this idea. Of course mining cost does not set the price. The price is set by the willingness of someone to buy at that price. This in turn defines the profitability of mining, but does not prevent morons from mining at a loss.
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:38:35
How does money created by private banks turn into physical resources? Why do you think we would use less of those resources if this money creation was not happening?
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:02:46
What do you suppose happens when someone does use JoinMarket for laundering profits from illegal activities? How will the law view the other participants, are they accessories to laundering or just unlicensed money transmitters? What about the guy who got paid to facilitate the laundering transaction?
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:42:55


You wouldn’t believe the amount of doublethink the average libertarian is capable of.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:27:25


They won’t. Cypherpunks have always had this exceedingly naive view that law enforcement is somehow entirely ignorant of technological developments and cannot utilize them themselves.
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:37:05
You’ll be delicensed in 16 months
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:29:22


How, exactly, does this theft happen? Does it involve a time machine?
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:37:41
Right, you’re imagining that things are as you’d like them, not as they are.

That’s exactly what it does not represent. Did you even read the post above yours?
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:14:33
Only an agent of the Reptilians would even ask that.

Imma pay my dinner using my phone in TYOOL 2018, my friends will be awestruck, then everyone in the restaurant will stand up and clap
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:43:51
Yeah but what you described isn’t putting bills in an envelope, it’s several people mixing transactions in order to to hide their origins, and the “market makers” are getting paid for their service. That’s like the definition of money laundering.
@_date: 2018-05-18 10:00:51
I guess someone donated them a rig, the bank’ll learn the most essential features of bitcoin and blockchain technology when it catches fire and burns down the office.
@_date: 2018-05-23 01:02:54
The miner, unlike the JoinMarket participants, isn’t actively trying to conceal the history of the transaction. All in all, I don’t think courts will be very happy about this new laundering method, and some users will find this out the hard way.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:28:41
Definitely the latter
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:30:04
You’ll be safe as long as you never leave your basement. Unless *they* track you down of course.
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:21:40
So it’s like a money laundering service?
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:26:17
I hope at least one of those scenarios is “maybe I shouldn’t have sold lethal drugs to addicts and tried to have people murdered”

@_date: 2018-06-23 00:46:10
This year bitcoin has charged its users a 70% fee so far.
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:55:38
Not even close to 70% percent
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:38:10
Lol, you have apparently no idea what inflation is or does, yet you pontificate here to other vulnerable persons.
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:52:24
They always were. Bitcoin has been an apocalyptic religion from the beginning, the religious core hidden behind technobabble and bad economics. Not very different from Scientology to be honest.
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:35:22
No, the Fed inflation target is 2%. Anything around it is considered ok. An inflation nearing 0% is bad.
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:15:44
Of course it is, Bcash is Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:17:45
Because attorneys want to be paid in real money, not bitcoins.

Just look around you mate, you don’t need to go that far.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:13:00
Yawn. Who says I already haven’t? Bitcoin is an uninteresting mix of tech from 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The religious aspect is why bitcoiners consider it money, and why nobody else does.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:25:27
Yeah bitcoins are pretty easy to steal.
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:39:09
Truth hurts.
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:41:19
Never mind the numerous spelling errors in this email, or the fact that I don’t seem to know the first thing about SEC or investing!

It doesn’t look like is getting it, or those who upvoted him, so I’d say there’s still a lot of ignorance going around.

As opposed to ending up with worthless btc?
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:11:16
Just take down the dev team, miners and exchanges, I think that’ll do.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:20:13
You forgot to mention
3\. Stockbroker services
It's only these three things that banks do for individuals.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:22:35
Wait, also
4\. Payment services, credit and debit cards
but it’s only these four things they do.
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:27:30
Half of them already are, the 4chan/t_d half.

No it’s the Chinese New Year this time for sure.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:05:17
But I thought bitcoin destroying other currencies was supposed to be a good thing?? I’m so confused now.

*hands the judge the white paper*
“This does not look like a legal document to me. Get out of my court you idiots.”
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:24:04
Wait, wait, almost forgot
5\. Currency exchange and international payments
These are the only five things banks do for their customers
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:29:36
Well to be honest there may still be a few dozen additional things the banks do, but what’s that compared to the warm feeling you get from knowing your bag of bitcoins is safely buried under your birdbath?
