It was needed with this release.

The key is sealed with a tamper evident hologram.
You peel it to remove funds. 
Our customers typically trade it between themselves as a collectible. But it is totaly doable.

Why not?
If you prefer others, here:

Well we could start showing it on the lower value notes. We already show mbtc and btc. So maybe we will implement it.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:32:44
No records. 
Of course. It goes without saying. It's practically demanded that they aren't stored. 
There are no backup keys. Only the public keys are kept.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:58:33
Thanks man! Its honestly great seeing this from you all. The feedback has really motived me to keep making these.
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:40:57
We also have made some lightning notes, but its still quite new to us.
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:34:43
You know it ;)
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:24:46
Of course!
1. As the BTC is actually held (via a cold storage wallet) on these notes, it is possible to do this at home or even when you receive one of these bills. In effect, every note has a public and private key. To transfer the Bitcoin funds; you can use wallets such as the Blockchain app to read the private key; which in this case is in the form of a QR code. This key is hidden under the tamper evident hologram. By peeling the hologram you see the private key. Once this is done since the note is marked, it is clear that the funds were removed. 
2. The QR you see on the left is the public key. This key allows the person in possession of it to check the balance by simply scanning the public QR. The sealed hologram also acts as an indicator. However I feel it is important to also add the following... The truth is that this system ends up relying on the fact that the maker never copied or compromised the keys. The way we have reduced this possibility is through four ways. 1. Security is extremely important, the system that generates the keys is offline. 2. As company directors we are quite public and easy to find (importance of transparency). 3. Only one director sees the keys before they are sealed (our offices are actually split between the UK and Switzerland). 4. The Bitcointalk community keeps a close eye on us and tests our products regularly. (key: we don't know which ones will be tested).

Thank you! That is exactly why I am working so hard on these. I hope one day we can in fact make these for a larger audience.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:49:29
As time goes by (and we see that it is worth it) we will start to make those too. 
Making them in satoshi now would make them look like inflationary currency from Venezuela :P
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:34:16
Aha fair enough. That was expected XD. 
For obvious reasons we keep a lot of the process hidden. We need to ensure that they are hard to counterfeit. 
But basically, how it works is the following. 
You start with the R&amp;D phase. Coming up with ideas, testing various equipment and features. After this the design starts. As a ballpark, on this note I worked over 100 hours on the base design alone. 
Here are part of the background elements. 
You keep refining the design. Over and over, until the quality goes up. 
Printing 
We were lucky enough to get funding from Bitcointalk members. This allowed us to work with a European banknote printing company to make the substrate (thats the paper/ security features). Those came without the main design printed on them. 
Then it is up to us to use what we learned and apply it to the substrate. 
We use various machinery to create the elements on the note. 
Each printer has a purpose and creates a certain part of the design. 
See more of the behind the scenes here:

We've had our fair share of mistakes too. But on this note I wonder if it was one of those errors made on purpose to catch counterfeiters.
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:33:20
Yes, it will destroy the hologram and leave marks/residue on the bill. 
The idea is to never offer these holograms unpeeled to the public. 
So they will only be released already stuck on.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:53:16
I'd actually welcome it. Imagine the publicity! Quite a few banknote printing companies are aware of what we are doing. We are in contact with multiple as well for future series.
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:37:36
We will be able to do this soon. Need access to the equipment first.
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:22:21
Thank you.  
To be clear, I don't disagree with you on this.  There is an inherent risk, I won't deny this. But the reason why I believe these are necessary is as a form of transition. People have used paper money and coins for centuries, if we want to see mass adoption then there needs to be a way to connect with people. 
My goal has been to give crypto this tangibility that people familiar with. Overtime this won't be necessary. But I can clearly see a gap in the market for this. 
As for DIY keys, we have also offered those. But recently the Bitcointalk community has trusted us with making keys.
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:26:00
Thank you. It's been a lot of work to get it this far. 
To see keys printed on them finally feels pretty good.
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:17:26
We've been experimenting with DIY keys as well. I think in terms of security it would be the best bet to avoid any chance of that. 
Here is some of my other work. Mostly DIY based where we never see the keys: [
But then again the reason why we manage to sell these is because of the trust we built and the security we put in place. At the end of they day they are no better than Casascius or Bitcoin Suisse.
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:59:46
How is that any different from an open dime or any other banknote?
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:58:43
What process exactly?
The Design?
Key Gen?
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:08:28
Thank you. I know this is a market where trust needs to be earned. I embrace this fully so I will keep trying/. 
The thing is I love design and enterprise. I really hope this will grow to something more.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:54:14
Where did you get the 0.0018 BTC figure from?
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:18:13
Thank you! I'm excited since we are launching it tonight. It will be a long few hours processing orders. 
Also no problem. I think this market will grow as crypto grows.
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:49:53
Thank you :)
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:07:44
These can also be checked under the same machine. They have UV elements. I will post an image of it in action tomorrow morning.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:47:40
The holo actually is not alone. There is additional foil to further block light and mitigate such an attack.
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:19:09
We partnered up with a European banknote company to produce the substrate. The rest we learned how to do ourselves since 2017.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:45:15
While that is true, they can never be an exact copy. These are not produced in China either by a vetted EU company so we feel the risk is mitigated.
At this point even the euro note holograms are copied, but they never get it 100% right.
Secondly holograms, as with any security feature are meant to hinder the efforts of a counterfeiter.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:27:26
In this series yes. But we are producing 66 pcs of them, and the community has gotten familiar with our work. So they trust us that our keys are genuine.

Here is the thread of the notes:
They will be on sale tomorrow. We suspect they will sell pretty quickly. We had to stop people from trying to pre order. 
On sale here tomorrow: 
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:54:32
There is a really strong developing market for this. 
I was lucky enough to stumble upon it in 2016. 
See here: 
People doing nothing but making, buying and selling crypto art, coins and banknotes. 
It's my little heaven.
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:47:16
Thanks! I hope so too. Fortunately, we've managed to survive this far. I guess you need to take it slow and gain trust.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:49:59
Thank you. I'm happy to see the support here!
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:37:21
Thank you. Haha no our website is here: 
Well to be honest I even contacted the markers of Guardian (the polymer that makes up Australian/ Canadian and UK banknotes) to see if we could source it. There was no reply there. So  we have to learn how do these processes ourselves. 
Maybe one day that may be an issue for them. But we have no interest in counterfeiting. Too risky and not really ethical.
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:43:23
Thank you. 
I apologise that it took so long to get back to you. Comment slipped in the cracks there. 
I agree with this, its a necessary stepping stone. 
And yes we did. A US banknote costs about 14 US cents to produce. Our current production costs are quite high. To be able to make at that level quite a few things need to kick in, mostly economies of scale. With the proper investment we could push the price of our notes down.
