I'm sure he's waiting for Bitcoin to hit $1 million a coin. Should be any day now.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:43:01
It is for those who bought at $19,000 or even $17,000 or even $15,000. By the way, that same money into an alt coin that went up 20x in 3 months would have been *so* much sweeter. Just saying.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:19:27
What happened to "governments can't do anything to crypto" and "crypto is totally anonymous" etc.? What are these people saying now?
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:15:18
Just don't get greedy. You'll be fine. This applies to *everything* in crypto, if you know what I mean.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:31:15
BitConnect is still around. Both the "business" and the still-actively-traded coin on exchanges. Just saying.
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:56:03
Are those coin designs copyrighted?
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:41:52
Fine. Make sure you cash out $77,000 and not a penny more. If you're a good sister, you'll donate the rest for a good cause in his name and memory.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:15:29
It's just not practical anymore. Maybe it will be again in the near future.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:42:31
Somebody tell me when the dip has bottomed out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:27:45
I'm just waiting to pay for my first hooker with Bitcoin. Then we know the currency is as legit as can motherfucking be.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:20:33
Try getting that on a plane.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:32:28
We take care of our own.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:35:23
Have you noticed it's only been fluctuating "up"? Like for *years* now? Besides, too many whales in it now to ensure the price doesn't drop too much.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:48:20
It must be your first one.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:32:37
What about that feeling when the sending fee turns out to be 10% of the sent amount?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:14:46
Tell that to [CryptoNick]( who's only 17.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:24:28
Don't do anything. Your brother deserves to take it to his grave. It will also help bring up the price of the remaining Bitcoin in the market since there will be fewer to buy and sell. It's what your brother would have wanted for the coin and it's future which he truly believed in. He wouldn't have wanted you to cash out and sell his coins.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:57:21
There's so much fucking hype about Bitcoin now it's virtually impossible to keep the price from ballooning. You may as well buy now. Even at $11,000. Because in two seconds it will be $12,000 and before you can blink again, $15,000. Also, don't wait for it to come down because it just won't. I've been waiting to no avail. Every second longer you wait hoping to buy at a dip, you could be losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars in gains. The next "dip" may be to $20,000 (from say, $24,000). That should be within a few days.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:52:39
Yes, there are plenty of people like that in the world. I'm not saying *this* woman necessarily is but she could be. Personally, I don't know why she wants to retrieve the coins so badly. Unless, I guess... she really wants the money.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:44:04
So much for "no one can control your Bitcoin". :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:15:59
Soon we're going to hear stories about IRS agents kicking down the doors of innocent civillians, demanding money, threatening their wives and kids etc.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:39:15
Well, he does warn people of the possibly shady nature of Bitconnect and also advises them not to invest more than they are willing to lose. Besides, people don't even have to use him (or anyone) as their referrer but *thousands* still used his link. Again, lucky.

5 years from now you will be looking at that car thinking about how it could have been a Bugatti.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:58:34
I wonder how many people actually borrowed money even from loan sharks to buy Bitcoin (the dark side seldom told or unable to be told!)...
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:50:26
Jesus, man. We're in the era of gender equality. Why the fuck doesn't *she* pay for the trip to Japan and propose to *you*? Or at least split it down the middle. Is she not as into you as you are her? Something to think about.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:13:04
This is where and how governments will exercise their stranglehold on cryptos (never mind the legal system just yet). It's at the conversion points between cryptos and fiat, which you will need in most places to actually make use of the money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:36:06
It depends how much be bought, doesn't it? 0.005 Bitcoin maybe? What a profit!!!
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:11:40
Unless you're pulling in at least 5 figures annually on Bitcoin, best remain silent.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:57:04
Ummm... not where health is concerned. You could get a disease even at 50 that requires hundreds of thousands of dollars of treatment just to keep you alive another 5 years (paying someone to come over and change your bedpan etc. is extra). If you can't or don't want to pay, well, the doctors will just let you die (as they do even today). Maybe give you some cheap painkillers (that may or may not work) until you expire.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:02:40
Best transfer the coins to another wallet, then. Or at least most of them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:16:36
I was thinking about posting some wise-ass comment to this, but even I simply can't see anything at all wrong with what you did.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:42:31
So much for "the government won't be able to do this" and "won't be able to do that". LOL! They could literally murder anyone in the street if they felt it was justified and there wouldn't be a thing anyone could do about it (except maybe get shot themselves too). Enjoy your crypto but nothing much has changed. Deal with it.
@_date: 2018-09-25 05:29:38


So like "bitcoins" would be a valid word too? What about "bitcoined"?

The media will find a way to spin that Bitcoin is patriarchal, I'm sure (and needs to be regulated to give women "equal rights").
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:40:06
The vast majority don’t have even that. Over 90% have less than 0.25 Bitcoin or something.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:34:17
So *that's* who these guys were! I just couldn't place them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:13:44
It's not that. It's the very nature of a "life and death" issue. There's no "bargaining" or "bringing the price down". They can basically charge whatever people are willing to pay to stay alive a bit longer or lessen their pain (which is usually everything they have or can find).
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:41:22
No court order needed to "punish" him either. Intriguing the direction we seem to be headed.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:18:50
Damn it, I'm sick of all this non-volatility. What happened to the Bitcoin cowgirl I knew and loved?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:55:43
I have a fair sum of money in Bitcoin but it's nothing that I actually need to live from day to day (I do just fine there too). So I can just keep holding and enjoy the show (however it goes).
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:56:22
I'm sure every single one of these "companies" has a forced agreement clause that completely protects them against having to compensate users for "hacks". As with everything crypto these days, do so "at your own risk".
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:39:11
And in most parts of the third world, same car, same monthly salary (i.e. same amount but in local currency) but add another zero to the end and take a loan out for 10 years at 5% interest. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:18:53
The interesting thing about all this is that when the rich and poor alike store their money in the same place to pool its value evenly, each can theoretically withdraw as they need and the pool should be sufficient to sustain what is today described as universal basic income.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:54:53
Don't  be ridiculous. Most of us are saving up for inevitable and ridiculously high medical treatment costs. Not to mention a decent nursing home (i.e. one that doesn't treat you like an animal) which, in 30 years time, would cost *at least* $25,000 each month (not including treatment). So there isn't much to "burn through" to begin with, assuming you even make a killing now and are smart about it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:12:25
I believe he actually got his big start in crypto with around half a million dollars in Bitconnect *referral bonuses* alone (which enabled everything else he's doing now). Like I said, he got lucky. *Very* lucky.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:04:58
*Or* the population has increased so much that the value of labor/services/goods has gone down dramatically.

Now the IRS has strong proof of income. I hope you can afford the taxes too.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:03:46
I won't assume anything either way. Why do *you* presume this woman is some kind of saint who deserves all her dead brother's millions in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:06:12
This is why I'm also buying hundreds of just about every alt coin out there worth considering and not selling for at least 10 years no matter what happens (well, I might sell a little every time the price triples but just to recoup my initial investment and then some). By the end of that period, I think, it would be safe to assume the coin has or hasn't any real value.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:30:34

@_date: 2017-12-06 06:19:05
Yeah, I mean someone in the third world might spend a whole month's salary and buy 0.005 Bitcoin or be left with that after fees.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:28:01
I'll leave that to the media but right off the top of my head, it should be fairly easy to demonstrate that 90% or so of Bitcoin investors are male so that must mean women are being discriminated against (financially), right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:44:14

@_date: 2017-12-13 02:30:26
It's nice to know a good part of the money will go into conferences at mountaintop resorts, hiring pretty airhead research assistants over 5-10 or 15 year projects (99% of which produce squat). And oh yeah, drugs that eventually extend your life by 3 years but cost $5,000 a pill (which you probably need to take two per day).

Well, there are whole businesses built around Bitcoin now and salaries to pay, overhead etc. Mining by individuals has also become less feasible.

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:49:08
No, they don't need much proof. Just like the so-called gender wage gap which most people still believe. For one thing, it's illegal for employers to do so but who really points this out often?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:53:42
40% in Bitcoin at most. You know, so you don't have to jump off a bridge (even though you might still try or someone you got into Bitcoin might push you).
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:16:39
A few years from now some people will be laughing about this.

I could be wrong but isn't there usually a law on the books that only "legal tender" can be accepted in exchange for goods/services by registered businesses?
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:25:46
For a fixed-value equivalent in legal tender, I suppose; you know, for taxation calculation purposes...
@_date: 2018-08-26 08:52:17
3025 and the bill is 100 Bitcoin.

I would be willing to bet that, at the time, aliens landing and appearing on the news was seen as more likely than Bitcoin hitting 19K.

MGTOW as fuck.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:31:52

Shatner? No offense but doesn't the guy already have one foot in the grave?

I always turn it back into "real" money as soon as possible.
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:13:43
Not far back enough. Waiting for 1 BTC = $10.
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:31:50
Thanks for this. I'm never sitting at one of those things. Even if it's way up there.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:28:07
I predict it will get there eventually.
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:39:00
Good point but historically, the thing people tended to say was actually great and wasn't like something before it is usually not the thing that wins out in the end. In short, it's almost always a surprise and no one really gets to say, "I told you so". For instance, can we find any major references of people saying back in the early 2000s how enormous and great Wikipedia was going to be? I don't think so. By and large people probably had their doubts.
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:40:35
Still waiting.
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:00:06
They probably charge what they think you can pay. Common in many hospitals around the world.
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:19:15
You do realize that that's $1,020 of other people's money that you didn't actually earn, right?
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:41:04
I'm hoping my "loved ones" never learn of it. Especially so while I'm still alive.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:20:04
The reality is Bitcoin is only as good as it's value against the local fiat currency (which will determine the "price" of a good or service). Just like gold. Retailers stopped accepting gold a long time ago for obvious reasons.
@_date: 2019-02-26 06:37:33
Most countries actually make it illegal to accept or make payments in anything other than the official currency. He should be careful (or at least check to be sure) if he doesn't want to get arrested and furthermore have his medical license revoked. It only takes one patient/nurse/contractor etc. to report him. Crypto, and Bitcoin especially, is in recent years even more regulated and on-the-radar than before.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:36:20
Whenever I see an old geezer in a suit like that talking (about anything), it makes me cringe of the state's eventual involvement, interference and total fucking up of the original idea.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:36:27
Well, inevitable medical costs, scans, treatments, surgeries, nursing care and a decent nursing home can easily run into millions. Especially in 30 years time. Take all that into account too before you choose to retire on what you think will be enough.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:16:36
There's no [tulip mania]( going on here.

I'm just waiting for a handful of billionaires to suddenly decide they want to become trillionaires by investing in Bitcoin. Then the bubble will most assuredly burst. And that's assuming there's no government meddling in the meantime.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:37:25
By the time that happens, Bitcoin and most other recognized alt coins will be so fucking regulated there will be a full name, recent passport photo and home address attached to every transaction and demanded by every bank. So don't bother running. Just -50% on whatever you made (not what you lost) and count on living with that. Assuming it's enough. Don't forget your eventual and inevitable medical and nursing home costs. Medical costs go up about 15% a year, though, so in 30 years, do the math. Today, decent treatment and care costs about $1 million out of pocket.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:40:28
A Guinness World Record for the most expensive pizza adjusted for "inflation"?
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:40:40


Bull fucking shit. NOTHING worth real money can be purchased over the phone these days. If Bitcoin is headed down this path, it will be no different than regular, stale, slow-poke stocks.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:53:31
What about the Mexican who bought $13 of Bitcoin and ended up learning $12 were in fees?
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:54:10
Okay, I can see that point. I just wouldn't want these businesses to throw their hands up at some point and complain hardly anyone pays them in Bitcoin (in which case it could backfire).
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:13:35
Do they also accept payment in gold biscuits now?
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:18:28
At the end of the day, retailers there still need to accept it or it's useless.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:22:15
Never mind Bitcoin. They are actually trying to regulate the entire Internet (and succeeding to a degree).
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:19:33
Wow. What great advice! I can't wait for Bitcoin to be worth 10 trillion a coin! It should be any time now! Wow!
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:07:23
Well, at least it's well-written and informative (assuming the content is true).
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:35:28
I've been using computers for decades. Like back when *storage space* was actually a big fucking deal and factored into just about every computing decision/idea. Somehow it seems those who came up with this blockchain concept never even considered that to be an issue (at least at some point), which is surprising to say the least.
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:53:33
Exactly. And don't rely on medical science to cure anything much. They're in the business of making money too and the world is suffering from overpopulation anyway (they know this very well). And uh, nobody is going to grant you some kind of immortality through science either (they just say that shit to get grant money and then we never see any results).
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:49:38
It's because they have little to lose if the shit hits the fan (and it probably will at some point).
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:12:10
I know, right? Lately trading (or even sending) Bitcoin (anywhere) is becoming really slow to say the least and downright unreliable in some cases. Never mind the high transaction fees. This isn't  a complaint. It's constructive criticism and unlike a cure for cancer and old age, I hope some well-funded, highly skilled and influential people are actually working on it seriously.
@_date: 2019-02-12 02:48:38
Maybe even rich enough to afford good cancer treatment in Long Beach and a classy nursing home in Switzerland.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:27:19
We've all been there. I converted all my BCH into BTC a microsecond before the price of BCH doubled. Time to put the smartphone down and forget about crypto for a while.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:04:09
There's going to be a reasonable maximum value due to market cap and competition with alt coins. It just can't go up forever. But until then, enjoy the ride. :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:36:32
I *really* shouldn't have exchanged all my BCH for BTC a microsecond before the price of BCH literally doubled.

Isn't that illegal?
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:05:34
Let's all save our Bitcoin for our eventual medical and nursing home costs (which may run into millions in 30 years time). There couldn't be a better way to spend it. It beats having to blow your own brains out or jump off a bridge because you can't afford treatment/help.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:52:42
Sounds like a good plot for a movie.

For one thing, the transaction fees and time it takes. At least for now.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:46:10
It's not just them. People, myself included, are experiencing all kinds of delays and errors from all kinds of service providers trying to move Bitcoin around. It would appear they just can't cope with the demand. Maybe they were just 3 people in a dorm room and now they realize they need a staff of 30 (and can't afford them).
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:41:29
Aren't even the credit card machines not working properly half the time in places like that?

Well, some companies don't allow people to advertise porn etc. so I suppose they have the right. I mean, there's no "good porn" vs. "bad porn". So lump them together and just ban.

Either way, a lot of people are going to feel robbed at the end of the day. The majority, in fact.

I'm sure there's fine print everywhere saying that if you lose your money, it's all your fault and no one can be held liable. This is Bitcoin. That means we're in the Wild West of the 1850s, essentially. At least for now until regulation steps in.
@_date: 2019-01-15 03:58:25
We just have to agree, as a species, that it is.
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:14:41
Sorry to burst your bubble but Bitcoin isn't invincible. I hope you don't have too much invested in it.
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:35:26
Give it time. It will either go mainstream and be subject to regulation or go bust.

These are the people we never hear about until we hear about them. Just about everyone's heard of the 100 million dollar Bitcoin pizzas, though.

How the hell could you possibly know if you made more than I?
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:51:43
They can just make it illegal to trade or own Bitcoin. What then? Do you think Bitcoin is the first thing in history that a government has made illegal and enforced that illegality? And yes, they can easily find you too.
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:43:12
And probably not-as-legal anymore or they've stopped by now too.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:53:39
Some people seriously think Bitcoin will reach $1 million so you should be fine.

Sounds a bit like "By 2040, we'll have a cure for cancer". Wait, they also said that about 1990, 2000 and 2015. Flying cars by 2015? Yeah, I think that too. Vacationing on the moon by the year 2000? Definitely that one as well was said in the 1970s.

Don't get me wrong, I like Luno. It's perfect for me except for the (unpredictably high) transaction fees. I guess that's the price we pay for good service. I'd rather not have to "sign up" again with all my personal info anywhere else for another wallet and I'd hate to have to pay even more transaction fees moving Bitcoin from wallet to wallet.
@_date: 2018-11-14 05:23:01
I always suspected it was relatively easy for government to regulate crypto. I mean, these "farms" can't be easy to hide. Especially the big ones that would actually make a difference. And nobody wants to go to jail or even risk spending money on lawyers and time (i.e. years) in court.
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:11:02
When too many people start doing something, it kind of fucks it up. Just keep that in mind.
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:33:12
It depends on what price you bought it at, doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:52:44
Sounds to me more like the geeks getting bitch-slapped by Big Brother reminding them who's really in charge.

The government doesn't have to "dictate rules". It can just OUTLAW whatever it wants. Like I said, even the kind of toilet bowls you shit in. A court can even order that a man not use a computer for x number of years or wear an ankle bracelet while he shits. If a protocol enables Bitcoin it can be put into words and OUTLAWED. Simple as that. They don't even have to be specific. They can just word it something like "any and all things that enable the use of Bitcoin or any and all cryptocurrencies in this land...".
@_date: 2018-11-14 07:06:52
Is that legal to do?

Governments love banks. Just like they love the medical establishment. They are arms of the state and completely in bed with them. How else to control the public? Your money or your life.

This is great and all but life dictates that what goes up must come down (except age which certainly leads to something even worse... death!).
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:16:58
Things like this cry to governments to step in and regulate (which they are only too happy to do).
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:56:38
Yeah, okay... Bitcoin (actually cryptocurrency in general) is showing some potential... for now. Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:51:12
They don't have to go that far. They just have to make "Bitcoin" and anything associated with it illegal. Simple as that. Anyone still playing around with it will risk JAIL or FINES. Most people will bail and the value of Bitcoin will turn to shit. Yeah, that's pretty much "shutting it down".
@_date: 2017-09-24 03:19:32
Governments can even regulate what type of toilet bowls you are allowed to shit in. And if need be, legally take your life. You obviously have no idea how powerful governments can be.
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:30:21


I don't think this is true. On my mobile phone, when I want to sell a certain amount of Bitcoin, it calculates the amount of money I will receive and shows me a number. Presumably this takes into account any and all fees. There is no other number shown. Only after the transaction has taken place do I see how much I really got for the sale. The "selling price" turns out to be significantly lower and I often lose between 5%-10% of the value of Bitcoin I sold. Not what I thought I would get based on what was shown to me before I chose to sell.
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:12:34
Back then (1993), they thought we'd really have dinosaurs running around in 20 years. Just like they thought we'd have flying cars. Or a cure for cancer. Or even a cure for diabetes. Or even etc. etc. etc. We have some pretty cool smartphones to take selfies with, though. Oh, and cryptocurrency.

More decimal places is all.

If it even goes mainstream and regulated, that's tantamount to shutting it down. It's not Bitcoin anymore. The name is the same but its nature would have changed. Also, I wouldn't want to live in Venezuela.

This cryptocurrency business was basically screaming for a government crackdown. Expect more countries to follow China's example. The state is all-powerful. I guess they're done letting the children play with monopoly money thinking it was real. Like porn and drugs in most places, crypto will be made illegal soon enough. Like printing fake bills. Anyone caught will be jailed. How about that.
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:29:42
Damn it. I think I forgot to transfer the coins from my Luno wallet to one that would support the Bitcoin Gold fork.

I just paid for my recent home repairs within 24 hours. Thank you, Bitcoin. And China too, I guess.

In either case, time always wins in the end.
@_date: 2017-09-24 06:34:29
We're going to have a great "legal" moment when some lawyer equates Bitcoin to printing fake money and how both should be as illegal.
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:31:58
If there is a currency conversion fee, this should also be factored into the price we think we are selling at. Not told to us *after* the sale has taken place.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:53:34
I've been buying and selling a long time. The moment I make 25% or more in returns, I sell. This usually takes only a few months. Don't get too greedy. You can still make a killing. When the price drops, buy, wait a few months and then make another 25% or more (sometimes as high as 50%). The returns are incredible.

It must be a currency thing, then. Perhaps affecting only certain types of currency.

Of course I'll put it all back in. I always go balls deep.
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:09:09
I'd rather not say. It doesn't matter anyway. The fact is, the Luno app or system is fucked because it doesn't give you the right estimate before you must decide to sell or not. It probably affects many currencies and these guys are clueless.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:25:33
There's another fork coming? Glad I sold while I was ahead.
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:58:32
Most people will take their Bitcoins to their graves, waiting for the price to go even higher.
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:57:09
That's definitely *not* the case. The amount shown that I will supposedly get in the local currency *before* accepting the sale is significantly higher than *after* the sale. After the sale, the Bitcoin exchange value is significantly less and so is the amount in local currency I actually got. Usually by about 5%-10%. I think there's a bug with the app.

It means that for most people, the bulk of their wealth (or at least an immense part of it) will ultimately go to inevitable medical treatment and nursing care.

Yeah, right. At this point, I'd sell *all* my Bitcoin if I could make a clean 5 bucks. Maybe I'd buy more later but that's about it.

This is begging governments to step in and impose regulations. Soon we will need to provide all our personal information and probably have a printed receipt with our names (and traceable home addresses) on it for every Bitcoin transaction. Not unlike a credit card.

The kind of flexibility you are describing probably applies more to paid VPNs, which means that the VPN company has all your real info (e.g. credit card information, home address) and is subject to having their arm twisted by government as well (since using VPNs is a well-known tactic to get around banking/crypto restrictions).
