I'm unclear on Testnet. How do they make fake bitcoins?

I think that I am beginning to understand this, but I'm not sure. Now it's a race between the $.02/hr faucets and my ability to get tips to hit the minimum. 
Here is one that made my business partner laugh yesterday. 
What do you get when you cross a brown chicken with a brown cow?

I'm actually thinking of accepting bitcoin with my business, but would like to have a working knowledge of the market before I decide. Thanks for the advice.

Well, it seems to take 100kWh of energy (or so) to mine a bitcoin, so anybody who mines 10 BTC per year could use a few solar panels. What is the typical power draw of a miner? Are there lots of people mining?

FWIW When you are small, $230 is $230 even if it's only 1% of your revenue. That is another day- maybe 2 of getting paid sometimes. It all adds up. When I ship, I always ship a couple orders together- it typically only saves me a few hundred dollars- but that is money in my pocket. This is similar.

With a cost of energy like that I would fly, with solar panels to your home in California and my team and you would make double your money on solar vs. mining btc. Just FYI
I would actually drive and buy panels at the port. They all come from china anyways.
