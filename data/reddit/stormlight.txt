To your 1. point. A contract can be a short or long contract. One can not assume that the person thinks the price will go up. Especially if they opened 7660 short contracts over the last 6 hours since this was last reported.

Your use of "I think" and "probably" adds nothing but noise to this conversation. 
How much other projects is this 1mb limit retarding that we are not privy to? How are you measuring your sense of urgency and who are you talking to?
Who are you to dictate the dollar amount level that is considered worth while for security and decentralization of the bitcoin blockchain? Please point to me to the graphic that breaks this down in the white paper.

How do you support this statement. Have you canvased multiple parties in the financial tech vertical? Have you completed polls of other business areas that have expressed interest?  Or are you simply conflating your perception of the need for people to conduct small transactions (such as coffee sales) with bigger picture economic intent in the blockchain?

Just set up a full node on a Ubuntu VPS i have as well as a spare MAC. Took about 20 minutes for each. When i have time to get my windows machine running again I will try that.
Seems perspective was not something I was missing. Want to take another stab at it?
 
@_date: 2015-06-02 04:21:38
Seems pretty easy to me as far as ease of use.
Are these outdated instructions? Its close to a next next next type setup on windows and pretty easy to me if you can follow directions. I don't expect anything but to help the network. What am I missing?

pe·ri·od: noun 1. a length or portion of time.
Re-read the post i was replying to.  I find it helps with context. Even in this case it will show the definition of period in my sentence regardless that OP mistyped adoption "..grinding to a halt when another adaptation period " 
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:05:53
1. Support your claim that there is no econmic urgency with fact. 
2. Support your right to decide the dollar amount that is considered sufficient to be protected by the security of the blockchain.
Once those are furnished I will be happy to offer my own counter claims and or plans that may be in agreement with keeping the block size low.

"At the pace bitcoin is gaining traction, at least from VC,..."  LULs. You must have not been an adult in 2000. I was and it was great. I was being paid for 3 seperate full time salaries for a three products that where heavily invested by VCs.
Point being, VCs could place another 10 billion into BTC ideas. No amount is guaranteed to create a product that would increase BTC transaction volume. To base your worry on that is flawed. There is no correlation with VC investment or adoption period with said investments.

That person is most likely not paying with a credit card. Just like when I order 20 dell power edge boxes I use a PO with a line of credit from dell that our company pay offs before interest accrues.  Dell didn't save any money in this instance and neither did the purchaser.

"We do fully recognise the concerns and possible threat posed by an entity with malicious intent taking control of enough mining power to exploit the 51% scenario, but we also have confidence and agree with the views expressed by the Bitcoin Foundation"
Do you really fully recognize the possible threat? I dont think you do. I dont think the BTC foundation does as well or is in cover up mode.

I don't think they are content to pay 40-50% premium over Bitcoin prices. They are buying gbtc shares (not bitcoin) that has an underlying asset of BTC.  Not sure why people have such a hard time understanding this.

Can you explain this in a ELI5 way please?  
"The Trezor does it in random order which means the computer knows the words but not the order. This means Trezor has to use more words to get the same security as KeepKey" 
So when restoring a wallet the words that are needed to do the restore is able to be captured on the computer somehow?  On the Keepkey nothing shows on the computer screen? The way to combat someone who is able to see your screen is to duplicate the ammont of words on your screen to obfuscate the words you pick?
As a side note are any of the devices time proof? For example if I buy one now load it up and have it sit it in a safe for 20 years can anyone think of a posiblity of not being able to access my funds? Short of BTC not being around?

Sure, how is the cash app (owned by square) any different though then this. "Congrats. The US gov has all your trading records and all traceable crypto addresses you've ever used. Hope you don't keep any funds on there, cause they can steal them at a moments notice for arbitrary reasons." Do you think the cash app doesn't have the same legal requirements that coinbase has?

I believe they waited for the owner to have his Bitcoin wallet open on the laptop screen and then arrested him carefully not closing the app. 
They were then able to transfer the coins because he had his private keys saved on the laptop.

"Classic drones" Stop with the name calling. It adds nothing to the discussion and only weakens your post. As far as proof you will get none. What giant company ever reveals its plans before it happens. Did you hear Microsoft, Dell, and others announce they would accept bitcoin months before? 
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:47:10
Actually i would say this is a  short bitcoin moment.  (Not really as i never short BTC)  If such egregious action can happen and 0% of the public cares we will never get to a point were it matters and there is mass adoption.  At this point were people worship the kardashians and Mcdonalds it will take a complete collapse for BTC to come to a point where it helps against this.
@_date: 2016-02-22 18:11:54
If you think the price action is a vote you are naive.  Do you honestly think that a bunch of Bitcoin believers or core supporters said yeah, time to buy? Or do you think that the main drivers of the Bitcoin market place used an opportunity event to increase their fiat or BTC holdings.

These are some very odd examples.
Most people in SF don't buy or lease cars every few years. Using Uber is more economical then buying a car, paying for gas, having insurance, and paying for parking by a long shot.
iPhone plans are now $30 dollars a month that guarantees you a new iPhone every year. Most can afford that plan and get a new iPhone every year. Especially when allot are ditching the traditional cable bill.
No idea what you mean with the AirBNB comment. No one that lives in SF stays in AirBNBs. If anything renting out your apartment when your not around is an additional source of income. With AirBNBs generally cheaper then hotels I don't see a decrease in demand of out of town guest staying at AirBNBs


@_date: 2016-09-27 17:39:02
Then your statement was even more off then i thought.
A.Uber and such do not need the Midwest to be profitable:
"The urban areas of the United States for the 2010 Census contain 249,253,271 people, representing 80.7% of the population, and rural areas contain 59,492,276 people, or 19.3% of the population."
B.If you decide to not eat at the cracker barrel for one night a month you to can have a new iPhone every year.
C.  "And by spending crazy amounts of money, I meant how all these tech companies want new high rise buildings in downtown SF and these crazy conventions like the 40,000 Oracle one that just happened where rooms were going for $1,000/night."
You are not a PRO trader. You do not understand supply and demand.

Good point, lets only plan for today. Its never a good idea to plan for something before its need arises. For example why is there discusion for increased block sizes and side chains.
