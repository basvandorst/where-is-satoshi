No honest implies there is a decision to be made about it.

@_date: 2017-12-24 08:04:06
It‘s not spam it is bad fee estimation. The wallets use long fee estimation timeframe and the fee to get a tx in the next block in the last 48hs for sure is still 1000+ sat/byte even when at that time thy could also use 300 sat/byte. Just bad algorithms.

Difference is that the hub has no way to get the money in your  channel belonging to you which is very different to paypal or a bank. Also you are not forced to use a specific hub, market rationale leads to competing hubs.
Also you can always use onchain as well if you do not like LN
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:11:54
You are pretty bad at hiding your trolling. You can always find some scenario to „prove“ that a technical solution is not sufficient. But that does not mean that the tech cannot solve real world problems now and in the future.
With new problems there will be new solutions.
Nobody ever argued that LN solves any possible scaling problem of bitcoin.
Actually it is the other way round, a lot of people are arguing that increasing the blocksize alone would solve all problems.

There will never be only one market solution. There will always be a competiton. Just like ethernet is not the only data link layer protocol. But it is the one used in the majority of networks because it fits the most needs.
That beeing said i just have a different opinion on what is needed to become the solution which fits most needs as a cryptocurrency. And with a lot of solutions with big blocks out there (litecoin, bitcoin cash and others) i don't think it is needed on bitcoin now and maybe never.

i am not sure, but maybe because the block was mined so soon after the last one the miner cannot include a transaction, because he does not know which transaction are included in the previous blocks, because there was no time to validate the transactions. he cannot wait either, because someone else could find a block.

Plus fees you can collect.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:16:03
So what, that does not invalidate my point. Look at the mempool and what transactions are cleared. Those are facts!
And guess what there are even cheaper ways to send money. If you are paypal buddys you won‘t have to pay any fee at all.
Why not use paypal it‘s instant also.
I would not use it because i want to use a trustless permitionless, censorship resistant distributed ledger and that is not free. It is not very expensive as i showed, but it is peotected by POW and that costs money
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:19:21
i use this formula for transaction sizes which should get an estimate: 
    in*148 + out*34 + 10 
where in is your input adresses and out is your output adresses. in your case that would be:
    1*148 + 30*34 + 10 = 1178 or about 1200 bytes
Fees arout 10-20 sat/byte are confirmed pretty fast right now. one satoshi is around 0.00008$ right now. so with 10sat/byte this would be 0.96$ with 20 sat/byte 1.92
i think this is pretty reasonable for your usecase

since they don't have segwit on bch maybe. i don't know the specifics. maybe someone can help
This was someones answer on twitter:
"I'm guessing here, but I think that for backwards comparability the meaning of a SegWit Tx in the pre-SegWit consensus rules and so ignore all the witness part is "anyone can spend". It doesn't matter on BitCoin because the consensus rules include SegWit but they don't on bcash"

Thanks we will see what happens. I have a sense it will be ugly. The 2600 pump could have been just a test. I think they will try to pumb bch to make it more profitable so the miners do not change back to btc. If they can keep this up it will end bad.

@_date: 2017-11-24 08:14:38
I don‘t know where the money is from and i think nobody except the exchanges know.
The OP just points out that on a normal day BCH volume is 500 Mio Dollar on the days there is a lot price fluctuation the volume is 4 to 8 billion so he assumes it is not standard trading.
When you check where all the volume is traded you see that on the same days more than 50% of it is traded on south korean exchanges which have no trading fees so it is possible to pump the price while trading with yourself because you don‘t have to pay fees to the exchange platform.
Disclaimer: i don‘t know if this is indeed the case i just wanted to clarify

@_date: 2017-11-14 22:37:07
The point is you say you can transfer cheaper in the same timeframe with banks as with bitcoins and have no fact to back it up.
International money transfers often take days to clear depends on banks and their fees. My daytoday bank takes at least 3 days and roughly 10 euro.
I think it is save to say you can match that with a 300 sat fee easily. If it is a standard 1 in 2 out transaction that would be 230 bytes x 300 satoshis = 69000 equals about 4.5 dollars

There are some people who predict doomsday because of it and others will tell you there is no problem, because we would see the price on bitfinex being alot higher than on other exchanges if it were gox 2.0.
imho i think truth is in the middle somewhere. Tether is a shady solution for bitfinex problems but arguing that nothing else drives the btc market right now fits into a very convenient anti BTC FUD narrative that we are seeing right now.

i assume you are living in a developed country like USA, Canada, or an european state. From this viewpoint your comment is understandable, but ask yourself how other countries do behave. Think about regime critics in China, Russia or elsewhere and what is the states best onterest there.
Then think about asset forfeiture in the US or how countries need to devaluate their money to the point you can't buy butter with your trillions of whatever (Venezuala for example).
In the paypal, wechat, alipay world nothing helps you in those cases, because those companies are basically escrow services for your government controlled fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:08:14
Not that there are 2500000020203303 threads about that you could have found but fuck it:
1) ask venezualians about how stable their government backed currency is. Funny thing is with this almost zero interest phase you are actually decreasing your savings in fiat all the time because there is inflation too...
2) if you are paying 25€ fees in this time for transactions in regards to bank transfers (1-3 days til completion) you are either overpaying or consolidating very large inputs at peak times of mempool.
3) an 85 dollar gadget makes bitcoin easy, accessible and secure. For a lifetime. And guess what, you keep your money if the supplier goes bankrupt. If your bank goes down on the other hand your money is gone too.

if coinbase goes through and blindly follows the longest chain, it will be very bad for everyone. Alot of the people having spent a lot of time with bitcoin and its underlying system will stay with Core, alot of the brains in form of developers etc will also stay.
But those people are not coinbase customers which will possibly buy into something that maybe never will be bitcoin. Those people will be very dissapointed if their investment does not work out and there will be  a lot of confusion in the next months. 
I cannot understand how a company like coinbase is risking the future of one of the greatest inventions created not by them, but by the people, which they actually use as their business model...

First you say 3-5$ is too much fee. Then you say 50-100$ is okay and better than bitcoin. You changed your argument from too much fee to too hard to learn. 
I don't need a bitcoin business to see that this is a questinable way of discussing...
And yes i used WU in several occasions and always felt like being ripped off, because i had no alternative at that time
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:31:49
Please go and use the fee calculator and see how much it costs to send 500$ to Cambodia or elsewhere with WU. You all make these posts without any clue how much WU really gets in terms of fees and crazy exchange rates not even taking all the identification hassle into account. We are far far away from those costs.

She writes herself that she is accused of financing illegal organizations. 
I do not know what op did or did not do but it would  be possible that she funneled Money via bitcoin to organized crime or terrorist groups without knowing because she bought drugs online.

@_date: 2017-05-17 13:35:55
I do not want to disregard anything. But the block reward will stay the same for quite some time, so to make the revenue bigger fees are the only way for miners.
My question is simple if keeping the fee high would cost less than what is earned by fees.
This is not a political fees are too high or too low post. Neither a spamming not spamming post. That is why i used brackets around the word spamming
It is just the question if someone crunched the numbers.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:59:33
i am pretty sure that you made a false statement by arguing that none mining nodes are .01% of nodes and are now changing the subject.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:40:35
read your comment. it's not what you said in the first place.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:52:49
you keep repeating 84% in this thread.
But if 84% of hashing power are backing the agreement then why would a decoupling of segwit and 2Mb hard fork with 80% threshold matter?
The signees would always achieve the hard fork as well since they control more hashing power than needed?
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:29:14
I personally think people who agree with your point are living in the past. A lot of people don't marry and have kids and a lot of people willfully decide to have a relationship but do not want to reproduce.
Imho pointing at an evolutionary psychological reason is just an excuse to apply double standards and feel good about it.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:02:22
So the argument is not that there could be fake signaling and dishonoring the hard fork after segwit activation, but having only one software upgrade instead of two?
The technical discussion on the [btc1-github!]( has another stance.

No this post is about my experience while trying too see if i was trapped inside an echochamber and reading both subreddits for a time. 
I say "mostly"  in the title because sure there is also some BU bashing here. There will always be gossiping and trashtalking in both subreddits but the amount in the top posts is very different in my opinion.

even if it is not confirmed you do not loose your bitcoin. If the transaction does not happen, it is like never spent.

Nice namecalling!
Youre argument was rising fees will make bitcoin inferior to WU. And while that may  be the case for some people and businesses, as a general comment imho it is just wrong.
Additionally all your arguments would be valid for 10c fees and 1c fees also, because the learning and adaption cost as the inability to change into fiat within seconds are the same no matter the fee.

i also have a wallet on my phone with btc on it. just as i said it depends on how much you have and what risk you are willing to take.

That is false. If you issue a SEPA bank wire to someones account you have no right to get the money back after it was processed. Your bank will contact the recipients bank and they will ask the account owner nicely if he would return the money, but you are in no way entitled to it.

you all read way too much into that market share crap. Those values imho tell nothing.

i would never use a pc which ever was connected to the internet for my wallet with a substantial amount of Bitcoin. There are cold wallets for that. 
Either use a cold wallet (Buy new computer / install os and wallet offline with verifying software / generate address offline / Send btc to the address / only use cold wallet to sign transactions)
Or use a hardware device like trezor ledger nanao to secure your supported wallet.
What is a substantial amount? You have to ask yourself that.
Edit: Since you advised someone to either use a offline, hardware or paper wallet in this [thread!]( i think you already knew that.

Correct me if i am wrong but isn't it easy possible to run core software but fake signal segwit2x because then i assume most miners will use that before rolling out a new and not fully tested software on their production systems. At least that would be what i as an admin would do with such a short timeframe...

Thats not what you said in your first message thats all i wanted to say here.
And i do not say that the agreement won't happen. We will see. Maybe btc1 gets merged back to core. Maybe all of this is just saving face. Maybe the mempool stays as empty and nobody needs a hard fork. Maybe bitcoin rises to 100000 USD before september. Maybe ethereum takes over. Maybe the UN bans bitcoin worldwide...

No it is not yet possible to signal. They a add a Coinbase Text NYA to show their intent to signal Segwit2x
