Track housing prices in BTC: Sats per square meter for recently remodeled, desirable location, prime city.  You will see that you should wait and stack sats.  Price of real estate is crashing.  Why catch a falling knife?
Wait until the overshoot after the next halving.  Then rotate into real estate if you must.  Preferably borrow against your btc w/o selling and buy the property for cash.  Wait out the correction in btc and start stacking again.

Precisely.  Cars go on roads.  I want to cross oceans.

In my experience in the Philippines, in Manila business districts, it is easier to encash large amounts of USD at the banks than it is in most non-financial-center banks in the US.  Here it's big bills only.  Benjamins.  No one wants your $20s.  You can get USD10k or more without even showing id.  I tried to pull $10k from my regional bank in the US last year and they told me I had to call ahead for that much that they needed to order the cash.  What a joke.  The high dollar rate lately has caused there to be lines at the money changer.  Yesterday everyone in front of us was changing USD $10k.  WTF.

Bitcoin's volatility will not make it useful for such "short term" needs for 5 or 10 years.  Lower your time preference and use it properly.
It's good for saving for things that do not need to be purchased soon or at a specific time.
Like a boat.  Nobody needs a boat.  But it'd be nice to have one.  Just wait and you can have one.  In fact, your house repair money might just pay off the mortgage in 5 years.  It'd be stupid to spend it now.

If you have btc now, get out of all debt, or at least all non-real-estate debt.  Make sure you're sustainable and can take a hit to your income.  Make sure you have a 1 month and then a 6 month emergency fund.
If you have six months reserves and spend less than 70-80% of your after-tax income, you should never be forced to sell.
EDIT: I didn't mean sell your BTC to get out of debt.  I mean increase your income and decrease your expenses to kill that debt.  Doing this will increase the strength of your hand so you can hold that bitcoin tighter through the times to come.

It's not easy.  It's hard work.  It will take you 1-3 years of concerted effort.  Keep your mind on your money and your money on your mind.  I decided to get out of debt together with my wife last December.  Same time I started buying btc again.  We will be 100% debt-free by this December.  It's a combination of increasing your income and cutting your expenses.  Helps to have a partner.  I sold my big SUV I don't need cause I work from home.  Great car.  Loved it but it ate $2k a month in depreciation, interest, insurance and gas from my pocket.  We are selling our house and probably downsizing or at least taking our profits and renting while market looks uncertain.  None of that was the "easy" decision.  I want to buy more bitcoin but not with debt.

It's called leverage and it makes you a "weak hand" -- easy to force you to sell your bitcoin to stronger hands.
Some have the stomach for this.  Just make sure you always got powerful enough income to pay the min payments with a lot of room to spare and not have to sell any btc ever.
If many, many people do it, then yes, it is a speculative attack on the dollar but this will not happen for some time.  Dollar is the least ugly girl at the fiat dance.  She gonna keep value longer than many other fiat.

For those unfamiliar, this comes from the diffusions of innovation model, first popularized in the 1990s book, **Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers**
Any useful discussion of Bitcoin adoption must incorporate this model.  It's the go to vocabulary to map the territory.

Orange coin good.  Number go up!
Get some.  Often it goes down right after you buy it.  It does that just to mess with you and see if you are good enough.
Forget about it.  Hold for 3-4 years at least.  You'll be happy.  If you can hold longer than that, you'll be very happy.
Also before you buy check [ 
If it's higher (say, over 1.5) Bitcoin is going to mess with you at least a little bit.

Admirable sentiments such as love of place and ties to friends and family will always be exploited by gov. Makes it easier for them if you just sit still and play along. If you really are tied to a place (own local business, significant real estate, or have parents who do) you should be politically involved.
If you don't want to be politically involved, then always be prepared to leave for better opportunities. The best way to prepare to leave is just leave way before you have to, when you are clearly making a choice. I have moved dozens of times, across oceans.  A rolling stone collects no moss.  Social life is always great in a place with lots of interesting outsiders eager to network and make new friends... you end up with a globe spanning network of people who took the path less traveled.
