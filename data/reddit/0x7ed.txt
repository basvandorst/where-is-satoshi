" The creators’ original motivation behind Bitcoin was to
develop a cash-like payment system that permitted electronic transactions but that also
included many of the advantageous characteristics of physical cash. " this is the quote from the pdf article. 
They forgot to add "and bail out the banks"

but if they can crack the sha-256 encryption, they can directly steal all the bitcoin money. Also, they can steal from any other bank aswell...
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:00:55
I think I would... actually that period should be cut in half cuz from 2015 it started rising again. So it's just one year of wait to buy the real dip.

what happens if on a decentralized exchange, I send money through sepa and I get 0 bitcoins in return?
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:10:00
anything and everything
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:41:42
I believe you can. one easy to do solution would be to take the hashed signature of the photo and place it in the blockchain linked to the author
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:48:18
is LN based on proof of stake?

I think even it's absent even from the website bitcoin.org . I don't know if they remove it recently or it never was listed. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:43:04
ok so it's a separate entity

is gold about getting rich? I'd say it's more of a store value. One that SLOWLY becomes more valuable.

without those 2 pizzas, there wouldn't be any 15K bitcoin today
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:11:12
why is bitconnect a ponzi scheme? how are they different from other exchanges? could you predict their shutdown?
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:04:49
what I meant to say is even though bitcoin prices rises so much, for such a long time (9 years now) that doesn't mean it isn't a bouble. And even if it were, the technology behind it will still persist. And probably bitcoin with it (just as Google and Amazon are still with us today).

no viruses... but please next time if you link something don't make me download files on my computer
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:21:59


apparently you can't send to exchanges. ( ) 
when people say they're switching to segwit, how many are actually switching to bech32?
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:17:56

"Cryptocurrency, with bitcoin at the helm, is going to be even bigger this year than it was in 2018"
I wanted to post this too...
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:43:04
yes that'd be a problem, there are a few blockchains trying to provide a solution. to give an example there is  (which I never used)
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:39:48
you're trying to steal electrum wallets , aren't you ?
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:16:48
I don't see why our views are different. I don't want only bitcoin to succeed. I want cryptocurrencies to succeed. Just because there is a possible bubble now it doesn't mean some of those cryptocurriencies won't be mainstream in 5-6 years
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:36:51
they're going to update the cryptographic functions to quantum encryption before that

"By the end of the 1990s, the NASDAQ Composite reached a price–earnings ratio of 200, dwarfing the peak price–earnings ratio of 80 for the Japanese Nikkei 225 during the Japanese asset price bubble of 1991.[6] In 1999, shares of Qualcomm rose in value by 2,619% and 12 other large-cap stocks each rose over 1,000%. " this is from wikipedia.... the bubble blew around 2000-2002 . I'll correct the ortograph, I don't see why that'd hurt my credibility , I'm not from an english speaking country

no because then the price will go down and if the price of btc goes down then fees will go down aswell, and so it will be viable again, it will rise from its ashes better and better

as a big believer in investing in bitcoin on the long term ( 2 years+ ) I think the next few weeks will be one of the best buying opportunity you can have in 2018. A bank that bans me for buying bitcoin strips me of my liberty as a man and undermines my choices of investment. 
Bitcoin will probably drop lower. I don't think it's a justification for banks to paternalize its customers.

"The two ideas of human freedom and economic freedom working
together came to their greatest fruition in the United States.
Those ideas are still very much with us. We are all of us imbued
with them. They are part of the very fabric of our being. But we
have been straying from them. We have been forgetting the basic
truth that the greatest threat to human freedom is the concentration
of power, whether in the hands of government or anyone else.
We have persuaded ourselves that it is safe to grant power, provided
it is for good purposes.
Fortunately, we are waking up. We are again recognizing the
dangers of an overgoverned society, coming to understand that
good objectives can be perverted by bad means, that reliance on
the freedom of people to control their own lives in accordance with their own values is the surest way to achieve the full potential
of a great society.
Fortunately, also, we are as a people still free to choose which
way we should go—whether to continue along the road we have
been following to ever bigger government, or to call a halt and
change direction. "

a ban it's still exaggerated, if I have money and I want to burn them I should be able to do it

electrum only has bech32... bitcoin core wallet hasn't released segwit yet . what wallet do you use?
this comment helped 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:44:47
can you find a good reason for why I said that?
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:34:33
which one is the default one?
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:06:13
