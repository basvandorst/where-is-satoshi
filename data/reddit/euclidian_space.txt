What is great about bitcoin (and it’s genius), is how it incentivizes greed and that greed further strengthens the system. It WILL collapse the State as we know it today. It’s only a matter of time.

No. They offer fast and slow. No custom entry. I ditched them as well.

@_date: 2017-12-12 14:18:30
Agreed. Wish there were more like this!
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:39:06
First of all, it IS peer to peer. This property exists today, no question. You can adjust fees to send payments, which, can be low if you do it correctly. Many wallets default to very high fees, instead of giving users the option for slower transactions. Also, the lightning network (in testing now), once integrated, will make bitcoin faster than VISA. Anyone telling you that LTC or BCH solves the current bitcoin problems is a layman or a liar. They follow roughly the same specification, except LTC doesn't have nearly as much use, and BCH can carry more data per block. The only issue is, once that block size is reached, you have the same problem all over again. Bitcoin is actually trying to solve these issues elegantly.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:36:45
Diversification is something you had to do BEFORE bitcoin came on the scene. Diversification is pre-bitcoin thinking. This will change all financial discourse and best practices as we know it.

Your question makes zero sense. Try again, using your words this time.

All these pseudo-intellectual haters piling on this guy are obviously Keynesian blowhards. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:28:03
It is not a side-chain. There is nothing in the network that enforces ownership based on holding private keys. It would be more akin to a bank holding IOUs.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:02:34
Nailed it. Except, I think diversification is a historical artifact of having a low-trust centralized system. IMO bitcoin changes the game and those old ways of maintain wealth will be a thing of the past.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:34:05

Not really. You can look at average fees over the last day or two and just make sure the fee is in that range. Low risk, but high customer satisfaction.

BCH is an outdated and attempts to "solve" the scaling issues by using brute force instead of elegant solutions like the real Bitcoin team is doing. 
BCH has less developers, less miners, less mindshare. It has more crooks, cons, and charlatans.

1 satoshi is simply the smallest unit in Bitcoin (0.00000001 bitcoin). Put another way, 1 Bitcoin is 100,000,000 satoshis.

It is certainly real. 
It’s being implemented now. Integration testing of the first implementation of the lightning spec was just completed. It’s in a release candidate / beta stage. How soon will consumers benefit from it? Probably start seeing good stuff at the end of 2018 is my guess. 
You’re probably reading bcash/altcoin shills spreading FUD. Lightning + a few other upgrades effectively makes most altcoins useless.

@_date: 2017-12-16 06:26:26
It’s a smart move for multiple reasons. The biggest in my mind is, you have full control over your assets (assuming you don’t keep them on an exchange). Unlike the bank, which for whatever various reasons can block you from moving. Be it a lien, bail-ins, bank runs, etc. It may sound crazy now, but rest assured they are coming. It may drop in value relative to the USD, but in long term, it’s outperformed any traditional security by a lot. This will probably continue for some time.

Money is the only one that actually matters and the only one actually working. All other concepts require some form of external validation and fallback to centralization or trust in some fashion.
