Like they literally wrote the reason in plain English right there. Did you read the first sentence of what you copied and pasted?
Did you read my post?
Russian government is NOT prohibiting access to the website for Russian customers (and there is no reason for Russian authorities to do this).
As I said their site is not in in blocklist 
The site is perfectly accessible from Russia (mean it is not blocked by Big Russian Firewall) and access to site contents is blocked by their CDN/DDOS rules (provided by Incapsula):
 - Access Denied
Error code 16
This request was blocked by the security rules
Their reference to Russian government blocked access is not valid because it is not true. All I see is they ready some new article on coindesk and decided to block just in case.

The comparison with IE6 is not correct as in that case the update was optional (soft fork) and not mandatory. If Microsoft would make it as "hard fork" IE6 would stop working at some day saying you **must** update. This would be quick and easy.

It depends on the wallet, the only wallet declared they will support both chains so far is jaxx (this is already a multi-currency wallet).
If you use Blockchain.info as I understood they are not going to credit BCC to their clients, at least not immediately, see 
What you can do is to download BCC wallet like  and import the seed (12 words backup phrase) from your Blockchain.info wallet into this BCC wallet. After this you should see your BCC in this wallet.
For the best security you can then create new wallet in Blockchain.info (with another seed).

They do not have 95% consensus among miners, they have 95% consensus among mining pool owners which is just a small group of people. On the pool where individual miners can vote NYA support is about 8% - 
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:32:31
Are you familiar with pooled mining? Basically, mining difficulty is very high and any individual miner has very low chance of finding a block, so miners combine their hash power into pool, once pool finds a block in distribute the reward among all miners participated in pooled mining. Pool operator (owner) has total control on mined block so he can put whatever signaling he wants. There are around 15 pools now, so basically 15 people controls this signaling thing. Not that many actually. The only pool that count votes of every individual miner is Slush and you can see that only about 6% of its users supports NYA 
 Pooled mining is one of the worst things happened with Bitcoin and not predicted and expected by it creator(s).

Yes, you will have 1 BTC and 1BCC after they fork

But this is futures/IOU market. To sell you need to trust ViaBTC to freeze your BTC until August 1, you also need to pass ID verification. And it is not available for US citizens.
Once the fork will actually happen there will be more exchanges and the procedure to sell will be much easier and the price will be much lower.

There was a public statement from multiple exchanges regarding any contentious hardfork (chain split) 
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:35:12
On August 1 at least one fork is expected - Bitcoin Cash (new altcoin) is forking off from Bitcoin, see  If you have some amount of Bitcoin at time of the fork you will get the same amount of Bitcoin Cash in new chain (which you will be able to sell - free money). But this does not apply to Bitcoin you store at Coinbase as they said they will not credit coins from new forks to their clients. That's it. This does not affect ETH or other blockchains.

Segwit haters believe Segwit is not Bitcoin, against Satoshi vision, etc.
Bigblocker maximalists believe 2MB HF promised by SegWit2X will not be enough (and will likely not happen).
So they created an altcoin of their dream – without Segwit and with 8MB blocks.
Many of them seem to really believe it will outperform original Bitcoin and will have wider adoption (a coin with 8MB blocks is 8 times more valuable than a coin with 1MB blocks).
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:21:50


There is a single signaling for both HF and segwit being developed. This means if they signaled segwit they also signaled HF. And it will be activated, just a matter of time. If they later chose to run software that does not support the HF they will just fork themself off the network.


As you said "No one is forcing them to run hard fork code on their computers.". Why would everyone who signed the Segwit2x agreement will install the 2MB HF code later?
So again, people agreed to activate both segwit and HF, not just one of those, the solution must guarantee both will be activated so both sides will be satisfied. Otherwise the solution is not workable. Activating SegWit via BIP141/148 does not guarantee another part (2mb HF) will be activated, so it is not workable for segwit2x.
I am not a fan of Segwit2x and UASF is a great idea, but I understand BIP148 will likely lead to a network split and Segwit2x has higher chances to survive.
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:14:49
One side wants segwit, another side wants a base block size increase HF.
They agreed to have both of them, so both sides will be more or less satisfied (if this ever possible in current situation).
If they activate current segwit code this can lead to a situation that segwit is activated, but 2 mb HF is stalled and never done, some participants may break the agreement saying they are happy with segwit and don't want HF anymore.
So solution is being developed to have both segwit and 2 mb HF activated.


@_date: 2017-06-10 04:51:57
Official testnet is expected after June 16
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:05:02
No, they agreed to activate Segwit2x, another implementation with another deployment. This is not BIP141 (current segwit) and not BIP148.
This is a compromise, people agreed to activate segwit if they get 2mb HF in return, guaranteed 2mb HF. So there will be the same signaling for both segwit and HF, just the activation timing/conditions will be different. 
The network split between BIP148 segwit and segwit2x are very much possible.
