I'm blown away, I hope more Soviet classics get memed! XD

Cause CPU mining is generally done using the CryptoNight algorithm!  
Hahahash! XD

Why doesn't Superman CPU mine?

Naw man, I mean I grew up with them... That's why I was blown away seeing it get memed! =D

Dude... this is amazing!  
I am blown away by the demo, this is the kind of thing we need to make crypto relevant to the average person! Just being able to buy something like a game with crypto with instant payment delivery while avoiding all the middlemen fees in between and not having to worry about whether your credit card information is safe.  
I can't wait to see how much this will grow as your games catalogue grows! Keep up the awesome work!

Not newegg.ca, only newegg.com accepted it before.

I don't see why they would be afraid considering they're advertising it publicly. I'd sooner guess that it was a low effort launch and they just haven't updated the site yet.  
It's a step in the right direction but I see this as more of a PR stunt for the time being than anything as not too many people are using Bitcoin to buy things just yet, especially in the current market. I'd keep HODLing for now.

I think it's good either way because acceptance helps creates positive mentality towards Bitcoin for the average person. If all major stores start accepting Bitcoin it won't matter too much what they do with the Bitcoin they receive as long as I could pay for stuff with it.

I've bought stuff from newegg.ca many times and never had issues. They have competitive prices and personally I prefer them over CanadaComputers.

This is likely due to the much lower fees, I can't wait to see what happens when lightning becomes mainstream!

I got the link from newegg's Facebook page, clicked on it and copy/pasted the URL to the promo page. I have no idea if the end part of the URL is any sort of affiliation but the link works with the part after ".html" cut off: 
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:27:26
All good, I should have looked at the URL before I copied but it doesn't look like an affiliate link so I'm glad it turned out ok.
