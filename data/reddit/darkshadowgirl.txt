It wasn't though. They announced six months ago that they would start Bitcoin cash support around the beginning of the year which is exactly what they did.  
 how is that inside Trading?
This is exactly what was planned and it was no secret.
 I'm very happy that they're supporting Bitcoin cash.

I got in at 200$ and average about 400$ a coin. I learned about it from work, I work in IT and we were getting notifications of a virus attack on our firewall and the virus I researched was setting up miners to mine Bitcoin for the operator. I had no idea what Bitcoin was so I Googled it and it started my dive into the rabbit hole and I read satoshi's white paper and was completely fascinated by this mysterious entity creating something like this, it was like something out of a cyberpunk movie. I researched everything I could find out about it, talked with people on Reddit and forums and finally wrapped my head around how it actually worked and what the blockchain was and how encryption works and I just knew it was something completely unprecedented and fascinating so I dived in and put quite a bit of skin in the game. I knew that it was going to be a long game, and that the price would fluctuate greatly and I knew that the halving events was where serious price increases would happen, so after the crash in 2013 I was in the red for  2 years, but I held anyways and it paid off and I expect to hold to 2020, as that's the next halving and that is my target date and goal. I expect that a hundred thousand a Bitcoin is possible.
When I first learned about in 2013 everyone thought I was crazy cuz all I could talk about was Bitcoin this and Bitcoin that, everyone kind of rolled their eyes at me. But now I'm rolling my eyes at them LOL
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:38:07
Exactly. I still love Bitcoin, but r Bitcoin is becoming fucking ridiculous. They have fucking blind spot into a huge problem and refuse to see it.

Can you stop with this? Storing some money in bitcoin is not a bad idea. Sure there is volatility, but the risk is probably equal if not less then losing your money in a bank run. As for volatility the price has maintained over 200$ for over a year, while not a guarantee its been fairly stable.

I honestly think you should remove this feature. It is incredibly confusing and NOT user friendly.  
Calculating sha256 from the passphrase????? First, nowhere on the site does it give you these instructions, I had to find it in this thread. Two, how the fuck do you do that? and once you get the private key how do you import it into a working wallet?  Uggh.. what a mess. This is NOT easy stuff for a newbie. I'm not even that new and fairly tech savvy but this is confusing for me. 
You should make it an OPTION that you have to check off with some simple instructions included.
Third, your site really needs a straight forward FAQ explaining how it works with Namecoin etc. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:21:24
It doesn't even give me any options. The only option I have is to cancel the transaction even though I have already payed. &gt;:(

You have to put the amount of people who own btc right now into perspective. I think only 250,000 wallets have &gt;1 btc in it and only 10k with over 100btc. See the stats here:

I don't see this point. If Bitcoin is a currency for it's own space, how would it be that direct of a threat to government powers? 
* other the the obvious: tax evasion, laundering, illegal trade etc.  Which I think we can all agree that these things are bad. 
Does other country's having their own currency a threat to the USD?  No, they co-exist in their own space and used in their respective locations.  
Bitcoin will have it's own space and that is the *global* space of the internet. 
While I agree if Governments take a *hostile* stance and regulation on Bitcoin and try to ban or outlaw, yes this will hurt Bitcoins growth immensely. 
But if Governments take a *healthy* approach to Bitcoin and regulate it to fit within the laws of the country for the better good (i.e. To dampen laundering, illicit trade and tax evasion) then I have absolutely no problem with that. 
And in fact I highly encourage this. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:23:39
Lol there's no hassle. And the rewards are more then worth it. I'm curious have you ever bought or used bitcoin yourself?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:29:52
Why didn't you print out the Private Key to your wallet before depositing coin in it? Then lock the piece of paper in a fire proof chest?  A wallet file could go bad, your harddrive could fail, a fire could burn your computer, a theif could break in a take your computer. At least if you have a print out you can always access your btc no matter what happens to the wallet file.

 Your comment made me incredibly Bearish. If you guys stick to this ridiculous fringe libertarian, anti-goverment, anti establishment mentality, Bitcoin will be held back it. 
It's a little hard for me to be in this community being a democratic socialist. As I have almost NO anti-governent "stick it to the man" stance. 
 I see Bitcoin working ALONGSIDE current governments and financial systems. I think it will provide excellent competition to reduce costs, enhance service and introduce a great new technology to the world. 
In fact I agree with everything in this article. 
I'm getting more and more frustrated with Bitcoins immature attitude everyday.  I just hope it doesn't hold Bitcoins grows back too much. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:32:32
While I agree inflation sucks, I don't agree having a deflating currency in existence is going to 'ruin' the governments. Gold is a way to protect against inflation and Gold isn't taking down the guvments. Bitcoin is a digital version with many more desirable properties. 
 
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:34:27

I think the word 'bank' is freaking you out. Nothing too do with the big bad gubmit.  What I mean is a private service made available to Bitcoin users that would handle the security aspect for a fee. It could even include a insurance policy with the fee so that even if the company did have a breach in security you would have your coins insured up to a certain amount.  This way normal users would not have to deal with all the hassle of this tutorial. I think this would be a very valuable service. This tutorial is challenging even for technically savvy people. There is no way in hell grandma would be able to do this on her own, and for this to get major adoption, grandma must be able to access it.

Honestly humans are resourceful. If there is a better/faster/cheaper/more efficient way of doing something, people will do it. That is why I think it's inevitable for Bitcoin to succeed in this market. The Only thing that might stop that is an authority banning/outlawing it.  Barring that, Bitcoin has a bright future.

No you do not have any control over the private keys if you keep them on Coinbase. But you can download Multibit  onto your computer and create a wallet locally on your computer and store your Bitcoins there. It's not Cold storage, but at least your not trusting a website to hold your coins and you have full control of your private keys. It's easy to use too.  Though I do recommend *securely* printing out the private key, and lock them up, for every wallet you create so you have back up access to your coins  in case your computer HD fails or you forget your password. You don't want any single point of failure. 
My process is:
* Large long-term savings: **Paper wallets** locked up in my personal Bank vault. (Hard to access) (High Security)
* Medium savings for potential spending or trading: **Multibit**  on my computer and password protected. (Medium ease of access) (MediumLow Security)
* Petty amounts for immediate online and mobile spending from android: Web and android wallet on **Blockchain.info** (Easy mobile access) (Low Security)
The more risk in the storage type the less money I keep stored that way.  But the more risk the easier it is to access bitcoin to spend.

Third party insurance or escrow services can be built on top Bitcoin no problem. Once the market is large enough that those services can be profitable, companies will fill those needs. For example a company could come out and offer a small fee per transaction for those protections.
That's one of the reason transactions are so cheap with Bitcoin is your NOT paying for that.
Those services you talk about through your CC or Paypal is NOT cheap. You or the merchant is paying for those services through fees or interest.
What is the benefit then? Uhmm choice. You as a merchant or buyer has the choice to keep low transaction fees, or you could have to choice to sign up for a service with protections!
And if your so worried about right now then your a bit short sighted to be in the Bitcoin market. I think most people who believe in Bitcoin expect to have a bit of patience with it for it to grow and develop. Were still just a few years into this.

I checked out the site but it doesn't really explain if this is something supported by the gov there? Is an official switch over to a new currency? If adoption by Icelandic businesses will be mandated by the gov? It mentions it's going to distribute the airdrop buy government ID info that they will get from the gov there. But that makes me wonder, does that mean the gov is supporting it? 
What is the scope of this exactly?
I mean this is all I get from the side bar : "Auroracoin is a cryptocurrency for Iceland. It is based on litecoin and is 50% premined. The premined coins will be distributed to the entire population of Iceland, commencing on midnight 25th of March 2014." 
Which doesn't answer any of my questions and there is no FAQ that I can find.

Not all centralization is bad. Centralization can bring convenience and ease of use.  Anyways a Bitcoin bank wouldn't centralize Bitcoin itself. It would be a optional way of centralizing Bitcoin security for convenience. Maybe for a small fee.

Of-course assuming the bank was actually credible and trusted.

Then why ARE there prepaid Visa Cards?  Do people bother? Same argument.
Bitcoin it both a long term and short term investment. 
 If I hold my Bitcoin for 2 months and I get a 20% return I can then spend my 20% return! Wow Magic! Let's see my pre-paid Visa card give me that! 
Also, sending payment with Bitcoin is MUCH faster and effortless then CC or debit. I don't have create a login account, enter in my billing address, punch in a 15 digit number, the expiration date and the security code. Honestly all that irritates the SHIT out of me. It takes like 15 minutes to get started. I have not gone through with purchases in the past because I didn't want to deal with the hassle.
With bitcoin I paste in an address, click send, and Done! So effortless. It's just like sending an email.
It's not hard to conceptualize why I like paying with Bitcoin.

I'm going to copy paste my comment to waxwing to you:
I do see some disadvantage in fiat. Inflating currency is a bummer, who wants their wealth to depreciate over time? If I can move some of my wealth into a deflating currency (Bitcoin) then it's a no brainer.
But as for fiat being the devil incarnate, no I don't see that. And I don't see Bitcoin taking over the USD or any other national currency.* Nor do I want it too.
What I do see is Bitcoin being a currency for it's own 'country', it's own 'space', that 'space' being the global decentralized economy of the internet. If you could consider the Internet a country then Bitcoin is its dollar. That's where I see Bitcoin filling its role and I expect and want world governments and banks to join in and take advantage of the benefits along with everyone else in the world.
What's great about the internet is that *everyone* is invited. It does not discriminate. Period. Be that huge bankers, dictator governments or a poor farmer in Ethiopia *everyone* has equal access. I think it will level the playing field.
 *   Except I do see some potential of it taking over *very* bad currency's like Zimbabwe, Venezula etc.

Yeah... this is a huge hit to Bitcoins PR. People who where already skeptical, can now latch on to this is 'proof' they were right, even though this really has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself, but more about a very poorly run company.  You know they were all just itching for this kind of 'proof' to pat themselves on the back and congratulate themselves on how smart they were. 
Also, this is scarring off people who were thinking of getting in. I had a co worker who was thinking of investing, but since this news has come out has decided it's to volatile. ARrggh... I'd say this might set us back a year or more...

These banks are SCAMS that PREY on the poor. The less money you have the more they charge you for their services. 
One of the WORST evilest SCAMS banks did was the debit card scam. Overdraw .25 by accident and they ding you for 35$ fee! And the worst part was the WOULDN'T let you NOT overdraw. I asked them to make it so it would decline if I didn't have enough funds and they said, sorry we can't do that, balance a checkbook with a pen.  RIDICULOUS! My husband lost literally 100's of dollars this way because of this. (granted he a bit think headed and wouldn't give p the debit card when it kept happening) but still!  I stopped using debit cards for years until a few year ago Obama made it illegal for them to do this.

Your balance in recorded under your public address on the blockchain. Go ahead and paste in your public address into blockchain.info. It will show you your balance. It's a strange concept but the blockchain is a public ledger of all the accounts and it's distributed to millions of computers around the world. So your balance is safely recorded all over the world. The paper wallet prints out the **private key** number associated with your public address. This is the **key** to unlock your balance from the blockchain. Hope that makes sense.

I like this comment:
Agreed; volatility settles down as more people use it. It'll take years to get reasonable, but it'll happen. As to "backing", note that gold itself is not "backed". It's just that it's scarce, and has other properties that have historically helped out in the exchange of goods process (like durability, fungibility, recognizability, etc). Gold has historically been a "good money". Bitcoin and gold are very similar in this regard. They are both credibly scarce, and both have a number of properties which help people exchange goods and services with one another. In the case of bitcoin, it excels in helping people do so electronically, which is obviously an increasingly important part of the global economy.
"Backing" is only necessary if something isn't scarce. Paper money, for example, is not credibly scarce. It is, however, much more convenient to move around than gold and silver, hence why it was created in the first place. Govs and banks "backed" their paper money with gold (credibly scarce) by promising to give gold to anyone who held their paper, if desired. So that, in theory, gave paper money a degree of scarcity (as long as you trust the gov or bank providing the backing).
Bitcoin is actually a best-of-both-worlds, given that humans do a lot of electronic transacting these days. It is both credible scarce, and instantly portable electronically. Ideal money for our times, in theory.

And if your so worried about *right now* then your a bit short sighted to be in the Bitcoin market. I think most people who believe in Bitcoin expect to have a bit of patience with it for it to grow and develop. Were still just a few years into this.

Uhh yeah, how about yes.
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:02:47
Yup I think this is what is great about bitcoin. It will give users CHOICE. There will be company's offering security and counterparty risk protection for a fee if people want or need it, but there will always be the ability to go without if you don't want it. Ahh so much potential! 
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:32:12

I do not mind all centralization. A lot of centralization can be established for the greater good. But as we *all* know too much concentration of power can cause corruption. So it's a fine line and it always will be. 
Bitcoin can be a level the playing field among powers and grant access to people who normally wouldn't have any.
So no Bitcoin does not directly conflict with my beliefs.  
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:46:17
No YOU are destroying Bitcoin. GO AWAY!
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:22:23
You know for every 'bad' deal you've have buying with Bitcoin 1000's of perfectly 'good' deals have happened with Bitcoin. I have bought a lot of stuff with Bitcoin and have YET to have a bad experience. List of companies that I have bought from with excellent results:
*   - Magnet toys
*  -Alpaca Socks
*  -Nice Key-chain
*  - Stickers and plastic baggies for paperwallets
*  - xmas gifts (and I got excellent customer service here!)
* Overstock.com -self explanatory
* Tigerdirect.com - self explanatory 
Your argument has nothing to do with BItcoin in the least. When I buy from a company I do at *least* the very miniamal due diligence and check their reputation through review etc. 
If a website looks a little sketchy I avoid them. If the rumors are going around about shoddy service I avoid them.
Saying Bitcoin will fail because of Trezor or BFL?! I mean come on, the stories about those companies had been going around for a LONG time. It would not have been that hard to avoid those situations.

This is *very* good news. Remittances are huge there. This is a *perfect* market for Bitcoin. If this takes off in Philippines then it will pave the way for other countries with high remittances to also adopt Bitcoin, like India. Also I have a feeling the Philippines is not going to be nearly as harsh as China on regulation. Which may further encourage other Asian countries to follow suit.

Well by *design* Bitcoin is a deflationary currency.  So *yes* in theory the value will be going up most of the time and so far this has held true through its 5 year history. 
 I have no real reason to not expect it to give me *some* return over time.  
 
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:17:54
I hoard and spend. I have a hoard stash that I lock away,  and I have a spend stash, that I spend and replenish as I go. I might take a little out of the spend stash and add it to my savings. Just like any kind of money you have savings and you have spending money.  
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:46:53
Ugh that would be so cool! I hope it happens soon.

What is 'importprivkey'?? I use multibit and blockchain.info.
I know how to sweep a private key into an existing address on blockchain.info but that's about it. 
Once you do that though, that public address is toast, since you used the private key.

I use Blockchain.info and Multibit to handle all these. 
1) Managing wallet over multiple Devices
I use blockchain.info for this. Create a wallet on their website and download their app onto your android. Send the amount of bitcoin you would like to be mobile from Multibit to Blockchain.info wallet. Then you can link the blockchain android app to the wallet. The balance will show up on your Android which you can now use out in the world. 
Only store as much Bitcoin on blockchain as your would carry cash in your back pocket.  I don't use Web wallets for large storage. You wouldn't carry your life savings in your wallet in your pants right? Same with blockchain. 
2)  How do I backup and cold storage my bitcoins on flash drives and paper wallets? 
You can use 
Or 
 to make and print out a paper wallet.  I personally like  cause the wallets there are nice looking. 
to be ultra secure you would want to download the website to a offline computer using a Ubunto LiveCD. 
Once you have the paper wallet printed then you can just send the Bitcoin to that address from Multibit. 
One other tip, just something I like to do using Multibit is everytime I make a new wallet in Multibit I print out the private key. There is an option to export the private key to text file. I do that and print it out while the computer it offline. Then I take that printed copy and lock it in a safe. 
It's just a back up in case something happens to your computer you can still access your bitcoin.
 
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:52:06
Something that makes bitcoin security easier for the average user.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:01:33
You might want to do more research on Bitcoin to understand it better. The whole point of Bitcoin is it is a 100% trustless currency; it's "a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust"(Google Bitcoin trustless currency). It's a bit ironic because you say you don't trust Bitcoin because you don't have an institution to give your money back if you lose it, but your trusting an institution to give you back your money. Absolutely no one can steal your Bitcoin if you handle your Bitcoin correctly. Yeah if you leave your cash with a stranger on the street, of course you're going to feel insecure because he might steal it from you. Same thing with Bitcoin and leaving it in random websites or on sketchy exchanges. Cold storage is impossible to hack. Look it up.    
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:50:17
haha yeah me too! 
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:16:17
Also, when registering it automatically put in some Bitcoin address in there. Where is the private key for that address that is auto-populated?  
 I didn't use it cause I didn't know where that address went and put in my own public address. Now OneName doesn't have access to my Bitcoin address right? 
EDIT: Ok I made another profile to test out what happens with the auto-populated Bitcoin address; and now that profile is set that to that random Bitcoin address which I have NO IDEA how to access or who has control of it? WTF??? Can it be changed? Can I get access to that Bitcoin address??? 
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:04:35
They might not be gone. If the transaction is not recorded in the blockchain then the transaction never happened. 
Do you have your originating address? Did you check your address on the block chain? Are your coins still in there? If so, then your OK. If you can obtain **the private key** for that address you can swipe your funds immediately into another address and save your coins before that transaction takes effect, if it ever does.  
I've seen this happen in my Multibit wallet. I sent out some btc and my Multibit wallet showed the deduction in the balance, but I never got any confirmations. When I check my address on the blockchain, the blockchain showed everything there, but my multibit balance was less. My transaction was in limbo and never confirmed. Fortunately I had the private key I was able to immediately swipe my funds into a blockchain.info wallet. Problem solved. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:52:34

Watch this part of his speech for 1 min. I completely agree. He clearly says there will be a forking of the community from the people who believe in anti-gubment  and the people who want healthy economic growth within existing systems.  I think our little tit-4-tat is a clear example of this. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:06:56
Cool I've been waiting fora high quality Bitcoin business directory.
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:17:12
Yes the blockchain is the only thing that matters. If the block chain says that the coins are in your address, they are. You just have to get them out of that address before that changes. Hopefully Mt.Gox will give you your private key.  Or maybe they will do it for you if you show them that the coins are still in your address on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:26:55
Oh come on. That's ridiculous and stupid. Everyone has a right to their opinion. It's what makes America great. Ugh.

Yess! I agree with this. I think *healthy* regulation and government acceptance will bring mainstream adoption and growth to the network. Without it Bitcoin will stay underground.

So a fork could prove to be very profitable for me, a lot of people? 
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:05:45
What do you mean by "max block size limit is required to stay decentralized"? Also I think the intention is that low transaction fees would work to take over inflation if number of transactions was enough to be profitable, but that could only happen if it was scaled to do so.

What if wwiii breaks out the internet will completely disappear and no one will use it anymore??? And why would Bitcoin mining stop if there is a war? It's decentralized, if one country is under attack and miners have to stop in that area miners in other parts of the world would take over.  Can you please explain your comment?   In fact war is one the reasons I really think Bitcoin is necessary, wars have toppled governments before and when that government falls what happens to it's Fiat? It's worthless. The only safe place would be Bitcoin.

Is there a solution?
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:56:04
Honestly, I think the reason is, is that there is a lot of world uncertainty. With Trump as president, it looks like the republican war machine is gearing up. War with N Korea may be happening soon and Russia is getting weird, and Trump has been lighting up all types of bombs in the middle east. And this is my personal opinion, but with Trump and in charge I feel that him and his ilk will tank the economy. Then you have Venezuela's government in crisis with hyper-inflation, there is a lot of incentive for people to try to get out of fiat there.  If WWIII breaks out you damn right I am going to put more money in Bitcoin. Who knows what kind of shit is going to go down.
Oh an also, the 2016 halving is a big factor I believe. 
Also, Bitcoin just doing its Bitcoin thang.

When I was using Bitcoin in 2013 it was flawless. This block size problem is a nightmare and needs to be fixed if we want to use Bitcoin for E-commerce. But it looks like a whole sect of Bitcoiners don't really care if it is feasible for E-commerce or not. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:25:36
Wat. You don't have the wallet anymore!?

@_date: 2017-05-05 17:15:54
Yeah, so what incentive would miners have to ever change that? Is it going to change ever?  So it looks like I would need .82 to send that transaction. What will happen to my current transaction? How does this effect e-commerce? Like if I where to buy a game off Steam? Would I not be able to get my game for 12+ hours? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:56:16
Wtf? This was not the intended way for Bitcoin to operate. In Satoshi's whitepaper he clearly states his intention for Bitcoin was supposed to be a cheap currency to make micro-transactions with. 
"The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and **cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions**, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. "
And it looks like his initial intentions failed with Bitcoin. 
   
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:48:28
Huh, well that is concerning. Especially since in Satoshi's whitepaper he clearly states his intention for Bitcoin was supposed to be a cheap currency to make micro-transactions with.  
"The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and **cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions**,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. "
Looks like his initial intentions failed with Bitcoin. At least in that aspect of it.

Yup, just need a printer to print it out. :) But do a little research on making a paper wallet. If you really want to be safe, your going to create and print the wallet on a laptop or computer that is NOT connected to the internet. This is the best way to make sure NOONE can get your coin. :)

Sooooo all that implementation with those major retailers is pointless now? Also, it's not very practical to use multiple alt coins for e-commerce. If you want retailers to use digital currency, there has to be some agree upon standard so that the infrastructure can be supported. I can't see Dell accepting  dodgecoin,litecoin, eth, btc, etc. that would be crazy.

Satoshi himself, in his original whitepaper he released to the public on Bitcoin, clearly showed his intention was for a low cost method of decentralized payment. 
"The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and **cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions**,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. "

You download the wallet generator on the website.  
Then put it on a thumb drive. then use the thumb drive to extract the software and put it on an offline laptop or computer, **then** use the generator to create the wallet and print it. That way when the public/private key is generated where no one can possibly see it. Then print it off. 
The **public key** is the wallet address and you can go online and from anywhere and send your funds to that wallet. As long as the piece of paper of you printed off with the **private** key is safe. No one can steal it. As long as that **private key** is secured physically, no one could ever open your wallet.  The **private key** is required to transfer funds from your wallet.

And just so I am DOUBLE sure...  I'm asking... :p
I started using Multibit cause I feel more comfortable with it on my computer instead of a 3rd party website. So if I print out the Private keys for my wallets... 
And then my computer has a major failure and I lose all the data on my hardrive including my wallet files.  I don't have to worry a bit cause I have the private keys printed out.  Correct? 
Sorry if I am being annoying I just want to make sure I have no misunderstanding. 
Cause storing all that money on a file on my computer doesn't sound that safe to me either... Computers fail ALL the time. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:23:33
Hmm that is probably smart and makes me feel better about reducing my risk. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:05:01
This is nice. It's close,but I think it's only categorizing businesses that use Bitpay.

I dunno. If they are curious by your presentation the .50 will be a good start to get going. They will probably play around with it when they get home. They can try having their own wallet and send the money back and forth to another wallet.
@_date: 2013-09-27 16:28:26
Ahh ok that makes sense. I wish they would show it as an extra charge so you know what it is. Looks like I should get refund soon and I can try again. Thanks for the tip! Now I can pay that .0004 to get the keychain! :D 
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:00:49
Download MultiBit  and transfer your coins to a wallet you create in there. That way you have your coin in hand on your computer instead of a third party website. ALWAYS make a backup of the private keys and the wallet file and store it OFFLINE. Like a USB stick you store in a safe. So that if your harddrive fails you don't lose your coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:26:15
Your right and that was probably the problem. I had invested a bit more then I was comfortable losing.  As it stands now I am comfortable with the amount invested. So maybe this is all well and good then. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:10:57
Yeah it's kinda stupid. You really need the right personality to do this stuff. Someone with a cool head and an empty heart. And that is NOT me. My personality is particularly sensitive to regret and indecision.  Yeah.. I think I'll just sit back and relax and watch from the sidelines now.

I think PayPal is in a perfect position to start integrating Bitcoin into it's existing system. Imagine if Paypal added a 'Pay with Bitcoin' option to it's interface!? All the merchants that already use Paypal wouldn't have to change a thing and they can start accepting Bitcoins immediately.  They could offer merchants a BTC to USD option like Bitpay. That would be HUGE! And the world already trusts Paypal and would further legitimize Bitcoin to the world. Man that would be the stuff of dreams if it happens. Would kinda suck for starts up like Bitpay though, as it would probably crush them.

@_date: 2013-11-07 08:37:40
Yup that's why I didn't spend it all at once a week ago... but... now I"m wondering if we'll ever see 200$ again at this point... with big ol China in the mix now..  
But as far as I see it, if I keep the big picture in mind, buying at any price now/soon will be good. Bitcoin has just started to hit the mainstream... 
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:59:54
^ This is exactly how I got in. I don't care if it drops a little after I buy, like he said just BUY MORE at a discount!  Cause honestly my expectation is that Bitcoins will be worth 10,000 a coin. So will I care if I bought in at 800 or 900 when the price rises to 10000? No. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 04:22:13

Made that mistake once, never again. New strategy, keep some fiat on hand to BUY when the sharp dips come.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:23:32
Me personally I do not care to 'unseat' or 'take down' existing governments. And I don't think Bitcoin will be able to do that. I like Bitcoin for it innovation and it potential as Global currency *along* side with existing currencies. 
I see it having it own space in the financial market working side be side with the rest.

This is what I'm talking about. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:55:11
"UNic expects that initial Bitcoin adoption will come from students in Africa enrolled in online degree programs.
“In certain countries, international payments are extremely cumbersome and given that certain students pay on a monthly installment plan, the transmission fees end up reaching 5-to-10 percent of their payments and being highly inconvenient,” the spokesperson said. “Furthermore, there are examples of non-traditional digital currencies in Africa, such as m-Pesa in Kenya that have reached wide adoption.”
This is exactly how I envision Bitcoin really fulfilling its role. A global currency for global transactions. Wow. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:16:34
Honestly serves em right. I don't really feel sorry for them.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:50:55
This! We need to start requesting!!! 
I just requested Bitcoin payments for this new company. 
And the response I got was 'Bitcoin? Isn't that just for drugs?'
And I was like 'No not at all" and pointed them to coinbase and Bitpay for merchant setup and they said they will set it up and let me know when it's ready!! 
Just ASKING makes a huge difference! 
@_date: 2013-12-28 04:24:16
It's not weak kneed. It's smart. He's running a business and they can't accept the huge risk of the volatility.  They have wages to pay and share holders to answer too. Don't take is personally. Like he said, it's a chicken and and egg problem. You can't get stability with out adoption and you can't get adoption without stability.   This is a solution to that problem, putting training wheels on it. Once there is some stability in the currency, then business will start accepting it directly. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 19:20:47
Hehe I want my keychain! I got my refund and ordered it. Woot Woot!
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:58:52
Yes.  If it is reputable of course, but assuming it would be, yes I believe Bitcoin could definitely use a service like this. In fact wallet security is seriously lacking in the user friendly department. Even for me, and I am tech savvy, it is difficult and cumbersome and I still don't feel secure.  If these issues don't get worked out then it can't go mainstream. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:36:37
True. I love bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:32:41
Well something more like Yelp. Where you can search by location, category, business type, reviews etc. 
coinmap.org only works for brick and mortar shops, not online shops, and you can't organize by business type etc.

@_date: 2013-09-26 21:37:40
I don't get what is happening... I made a blockchain wallet... and I went to go buy a keychain from bitcoinkeychain.com for 9.99 or .0799 BTC
I had exactly .08 BTC in my wallet...
SO I checkout and got the address to send it to and I put it in blockchain wallet to send .0799 BTC but then said I didn't have enough it cost .0804??? 
So I just out in .08  cause I don't have the other .0004
and now bitcoinkeychain.com says I paid .0795 and owe them .0004 
but wallet says I sent .08?? 
are these like hidden fees?

I wont trust any website that ends in .io  Sorry. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:27:57
I don't get the point of saving ANY wallet files.
Files corrupt and so does any media you could save it on. CDs, USBs etc. They all have a high chance of failure. But 
paper is paper. 
  What I want to do is get an offline computer. Transfer my wallet on to it. Have it create the Paper Private Key. Print it out. Put the paper in a safe deposit at the bank. Delete ALL Wallet files related to that wallet.
 Then I only keep the public key on hand to send deposits to periodically. 
Does this sound like an OK plan? 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:46:36
I dunno i just have a feeling.... and it sounds romantic.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:47:48
Can someone explain what he did wrong? I don't really understand. So he kept the original wallet.dat file and deleted the new ones? But since he made changes the old one became invalid? Be good information to know so others don't make mistakes.

Lol 
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:41:11
I some know about ripple.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:15:05
Sweet sweet regret. :P
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:53:06
This was actually a VERY positive article! No drugs and hitmen! The exact opposite. It was all about US political candidates and parties accepting them for donations. :)  
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:02:17


So as soon as a send my bitcoin to a generated address... That address is 'in the system' and good to go? 
What if.. someone else randomly generated the address after I did? Would they then be able to send out my money? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:12:11
Lame. Not all Bitcoiners are Gubment hating libertarians.  I'm a democratic socialist and I LOVE Bitcoin! :) 
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:27:41
Can someone record the hearings and post them to YouTube so people can watch later? Please.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:34:35
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:29:43
Meh... Just the negative sentiment gets  me. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:36:24
Ahh ok I didn't actually open it. I clicked on it the wheel was spinning and then I quickly canceled it before anything opened. I am super nervous it ran some worm or something without me knowing. Ughh.. I need to get my coins in cold storage asap!
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:18:43
Even if the website blockchain.info that I got the wallet from  goes out of business? Or goes offline permanently? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:23:24
OMG TOM's ending speech and the price is just RISING!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:58:48
Is this real? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:55:45
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:03:05
lol crazzzy... 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:00:49
How did you get 70 free btc? Day trading? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:43:47
Yeah it's just the first transaction you can only have one. Once it goes through after the first week then you can make multiple transactions at once. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:10:04
Do you think Worms like ZeroAccess are a threat to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:00:31
Interesting so many pro bitcoin enthusiasts hate bitcoin so much.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:26:19
There is no option to encrypt a wallet? Isn't password protecting it encrypting it? 
What do you mean to liberal with backups? 
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:31:59
This is great! We really need to encourage anyone getting the word out there! Think of what seeds you will be planting in people minds!
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:44:25
I think he was just making a joke dude.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:29:00
This is exciting! Good luck! TO THE MOON!! :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:05:52
I know. I never intended to daytrade. Everrrrrr... but I panicked with this drop and let go ugh...It's ok though. I think I was over invested anyways.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:56:30
Yeah pretty much proves this was planned from the get go.
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:10:16
Me neither???? Anyone? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:08:15
Yeah.. I'm thinking it would be a big professional project that would need like VC investment money.... 
Well I am sure it will come.  It took a while for Google to be invented too. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:00:31
I've been holding off on making my cold wallet and putting it in the bank deposit...  I think I might just need to go do that this weekend. lol
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:39:11
I regret not knowing about it.
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:23:57
Yes it is very interesting.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:40:19
Just be patient. It will get there. Jeeze chill out. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 23:35:52
Yeah that's interesting....so people did make a lot of money with this worm... 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:18:02
Yup. Was pretty fun and it looks like you can get some good bitcoin deals there.
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:11:43
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:45:42
Yeah but it would cost me like 150$  more. I got a used printer on eBay for cheap. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:24:31
Tom Carper you ROCK! 744 ATH!!
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:37:16
Nice! That article makes me think of this article:
This Michael Santoli guys is gonna be eating his words.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:11:06
Someones gotta do it. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:50:00
I agree. this needs substantial improvement.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:34:41
Wow how safe is my computer? I have all my coins in multibit right now on my computer, but I feel VERY verrrry insecure about this! I mean... All someone has to do is infect my computer, take it over and send off my coins! WTF.... I am going to put it on cold storage soon... But I have to wait for a printer I ordered to arrive and some USB sticks too.
I am even a little nervous using bitaddress.org to create the wallet. I was thinking of using bitcoinpaperwallet.com but I just don't know if I trust them?? 
Bitcoin security needs to be addressed. We need a REPUTABLE company take on this role somehow. I think there is definitely a role that needs to be filled. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 23:34:58
So these people DID make a lot of money using this worm in a shady way, but it doesn't necessarily hurt the bitcoin community or economy. Hmmm interesting. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:59:40
This is so cool! These are the server farms running the worlds money transactions!  This is the future! :D
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:12:48
Wow this is great! I hope this happens. The publicity for Bitcoin will be great too! 2014 will be a good year. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:30:03
I'm not alone in feeling insane! Wake up Bitcoin. Then 5 hours of Bitcoin. Lunch Bitcoin. Four hours of Bitcoin. Dinner Bitcoin. Three hours of Bitcoin. Bitcoin to fall asleep to.  Sleep. Rinse and repeat. 
Ughh I think I need help. Were is Bitcoin anonymous?? BA group anyone?  
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:25:44
I think he died. :( 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:27:28
Yup.. Deff time to pick up some new hobbies.  :)
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:07:12
aww no one likes my story.. :D :) 
@_date: 2013-12-30 07:39:45
Sort term devastating for BTCChina your saying? Well I guess he got burned once... he is probably hesitant to get get burned twice. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 08:25:14
My grandma wouldn't be able to do that.  :/ anything that makes Bitcoin user friendly and secure  is good in my books.
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:02:10
I don't understand though. How does the software know the address/wallet doesn't already exist if it never links up to the network to check? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:27:46
No once you have BTC on hand it is MUCH easier to use for online purchases. Literally AS EASY AS SENDING AN EMAIL! Paste in the send address and BEEP done. Making payments online with Credit cards is SUCH a PAIN in the ass.. First I have to make and account with a 3rd party payment processor, then I have to put in my billing address, then my shipping address, then the 16 digit code, then the 3 digits in the back. I hate it. 


True, this stuff is difficult to get into. But so was the internet before 1995. It was a serious pain. BUT innovations and startups came about that made it SIMPLE and USER FRIENDLY. These things are happening for Bitcoin. It will take some time, but there will be services developed to make it more accessible to the average person.  
Also think of the applications of paying people directly remotely?  Several times this month friends have rented cabins for a group and asked people to pay them back in advance. How I wished everyone accepted Bitcoin. How do I send them payments before hand when they live out of town? I have to Snail mail them a check! If the took Bitcoin I could EMAIL them the payment!   Now tell me this isn't useful.
 Sure sure, SNAIL mailing the check WORKS. But so did the phonebooks and land lines before the internet. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:36:47


What now you have confused me more. :P  :) Once I import from a private key it is no longer good? How does that work?


I don't understand this either. So my original deposit would be safe from the collider? The person with the collided address would only be able to send out Some of it??? 
 
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:02:50
Yup a piece of paper will not corrupt.
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:59:24
:) your right. I just need to take a chill pill. I wish I had some valium. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:37:56
Really? Where? What was the context? Was it promoting some business that is now accepting or just Bitcoin in general? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:48:09
Wow seriously lame. Why the hell is this guy getting upvoted!?  We should be encouraging everything that helps people understand what bitcoin is and make it more accessible.  Too many Bitcoin snobs on this subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:22:00
OMG 710$!!! !! ATH!!
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:27:21
Why are you not impressed? 25k locations around Europe will take cash for bitcoins? How is that not impressive? 
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:02:26
I think it's really appropriate right now. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:25:45
Or are the earlier mined coins easier to obtain then the later mined coins? Like it gets harder and harder to mine coins as more are generated? 
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:38:52
This is a bubble.. yeah definitely. But one of a series of many bubbles on a upward trend overall.  
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:48:41
I'm sorry..... I'm slow..... Was this skit dissing Bitcoins? Or dissing people who don't get Bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:01:25
Yay interbuttz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The rush and fear are all consuming! Its taking over my life! I think it is becoming unhealthy.... shitttttt
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:18:50
What??? the fuck are you talking about? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:42:07
I love watching the network grow! I hope Portland Oregon opens more restaurants that accepts Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:15:20
I know about papa g's and Madison's bar. Those are the only two I know of.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:51:52
Ahh thank you! This is what I needed to find. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:16:51
Yes this is VERY limiting! We need a more all encompassing Bitcoin business map. Something more robust that accommodates online merchants and brick and mortar. And that also allows detail searches like Yelp.  I see a untapped market that needs to be filled, any entrepreneurs want to take this on??? Please!
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:06:22
I think this is very interesting. It shows how much ROOM there is for Bitcoin to grow into.  And how realistic its potential future growth is in COMPARISON to where it is now. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:38:39
Why did she do that? Did she know how much they we're worth? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:12:25
the site is down.. is there a mirror? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:11:23
This is great! 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:48:31
You don't know that.
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:28:33
Omg... I did this too.  So fucking stupid.... Sooooo fucking stupid. AND the worst part is I KNOW Better and I still did it. Wtf. I immediately regretted my decision. It shot up 200 within minutes of my sell... Thankfully it plummeted again about 40 more then my sell price and I got them back minus one coin and a few hundred dollars. But fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkk. Lesson learned.  R.I.P my little Bitcoin :( :( 
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:14:21
This! Apple is an AWFUL monopolistic CREEP FEST! Uggh... They want to squash their competition and do it by creating their own platform, brainwashing everyone into using it, then lock out their competition.  All the Apple users are sheep that get punked and manipulated. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:00:13
Scary but true. Such a gamble. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:12:51
Flip a coin for me! Coinflipbot!
Pleaseeeee! 
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:02:11
These comments are depressing 
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:14:16
You get nothing!
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:04:59
Fuck Apple with a 10" dildo. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:51:28
And does your aunt have an email address I can send feedback too?  I will ask her! 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:44:35
Exactly. I do not intend to ever sell my remaining coins.  I will buy in again if the price drops below 660. But I might not put so much fiat on the line.  I think I had over invested way beyond what I was comfortable losing.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:22:27
Aww me too! :p :) haha you made me laugh..
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:27:20
@_date: 2013-09-26 21:46:40
It took all my bitcoins.... :( I asked for a refund. I hope I get it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:11:42
Can some read and summarize the testimony's here?
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:40:16
I hope the bubble pops a bit! I would love the chance to pick up some bit coin for 50$ since I've been missing out all this time. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:05:12


Oh I didn't know that. That would make a splash. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:20:03
I agree with MindyourQs suggestion:


THIS. Absolutely! 
Also I REALLY want to see a very professional, robust and polished Bitcoin business directory.  The TO GO site to find out where to spend your coins. 
Like Yelp or Google but for Bitcoin. 
I know there is coinmap. But it is not a very robust site. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:36:59
 I want to do the paper cold storage. And destroy any electronic trace of the wallet.  But I was thinking I could keep the public key on hand to periodically send deposits too.. But it looks like you can't do that? I'd lose those deposits??? 
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:38:07
Cool! I'm going to try it out.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:40:09
Instant buy requires a visa credit card. Do you have your credit card attached? If not there's no instant buy.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:16:54
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:11:50
Might not be a problem if you hold on to your coins.
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:13:02
Woohoo to another socialist Bitcoiner!  As far as I can tell there aren't many of us. :) 
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:32:37
Oh maybe. I am not sure... 
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:17:24
God I hope a correction is coming.. I to am going to pounce if it does... But.. .but ... What if it just keeps going and going and the 'correction' is ends at 300$?? ughh I'm gonna kick myself for not buying more a week ago!  I don't have the temperament for this crap! lol ;p  Oh well I'm going to just try to get my full position in in the next 3 months for sure... And hold for 5 years. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:37:42
How much did you buy? OR Less specific, how much do you recommend? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:46:04
Yeah I know. I was tired and not thinking straight.  Plus I can always get back in when the price goes below 650. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:15:16
I *almost* panic sold at 820. I held off... and a few hours later it was 920 again.  Your comment has reassured me that I just need to hold... and come back in 3 years. (My original plan)
It is tempting to think about increasing profits by selling high and buying in the dips.. But it's like catching knives. I'll just stay away and not test my luck. 
 
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:41:21
aww .. Well here's to hoping for 75$. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:02:57
Regret is a BITCH. I have some myself. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:02:34
Omg this. It's crazy.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:26:25
OMG this!. I am literally obsessed with Bitcoin now. I feel like I might be going crazy. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:19:11


Even if the original website that I got the wallet from goes offline? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:53:54
I might of clicked that link. What do you think it is??? 
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:57:55
And the blockchain is shared by the whole network. That's the whole peer-to-peer part right? The websites and software like multibit are just independent clients plugging into the blockchain (i.e. protocol)?  
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:14:32
All your bitcoin are belong to us.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:43:56
Hmm it's something. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:06:13
YES I AM VERY INTERESTED! 
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:30:29
Yup. Or download it really quickly 
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:22:16
Lol this totally confuses me. Difficulty increases with more computing power? Massive share of network? 
 I am sure you could explain, but it would probably only confuse me more :p
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:54:25
I just left a note on their facebook page. Hopefully they notice. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:56:03
Sorry for all the negativity. :( I'm really disappointed by some of these comments.  I am getting a bit burnt out on this subreddit. Tons of snobs. Thanks for writing this book. I think it's a great starting read for people just learning about bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:06:33
God I couldn't even imagine what that must feel like. 
I mean I feel regret (like everyone else) for not mining some coins in 2009, but at least I have the luxury of not beating myself up. Because I didn't *know* about them till 3 months ago. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:49:04
It was a Madison's Grill which also accepts Bitcoin. :) 
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:24:03
Already bought some.. put in 1/4 of the total I intend to invest and going to buy the rest in increments. Hoping to get the second 1/4 in a lull. Crash baby crash! 
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:50:04
Didn't have something do do with economic collapse in Greece or something too? 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:45:27
That's so cool! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:27:15
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:01:27
OK I don't get this AT ALL:
"You deposit $1000 into your bank and then you tell Ripple that you trust the bank for at least $1000. At your bank you would withdraw funds into Ripple and now you have $1000 on Ripple. So what has actually happened here? The $1000 is still actually being held by the bank, the bank owes you $1000 just as it did before, but now explicitly through Ripple. Let’s say you want to purchase some waffles and syrup with your money and need $400 to do so. Let’s also say the merchant holding the waffles and syrup uses a bank that is a Ripple gateway and that bank trusts the bank you use. You could transfer to the merchant $400 through Ripple which means that your bank owes you only $600 now, it owes the merchant’s bank $400 and the merchant’s bank owes the merchant $400. It would be expected that the banks settle the balance with each other periodically."
WTFFFFFFF would you WANT to do that? Just reading that  paragraph makes me incredibly  confused (not your fault at all , just the concept). I MEAN WHAT IS THE POINT? Just overly complicate a simple transaction for what reason??? 
I cannot see any benefit of this concept of Sally owes Sam owes Tom. So Sally just pays Tom crap.
WHY!!???  Why why! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:57:59
Exactly! Considering Bitcoin was worth 200 dollars LESS THAN 30 days ago, why freak out about a little drop on a Sunday? Jeezuz Christ people. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:33:45
Great post. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:07:33
Your right...I need to be happy with what I got and I just need to clear my mind and stop thinking about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:40:59
Well I went in at 200. If I can get more under that I would be happy.
@_date: 2013-11-09 10:12:52
I'm hope hope hope so!!
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:51:35

Man I love this guy
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:32:39


I would LOVE for this to happen!!
All this means is BITCOINS are on SALE!! BUY BUY BUY MOOOREEEZZZZZ!!!
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:04:01
I would buy some if I COULD! but nope this: 
Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Thursday Dec 5, 2013 at 01:03AM PST after your funds have arrived.
What a crock of shit. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:35:49
Can you only use these card on CoinKite POS? Or anywhere? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:53:58
That's me!
@_date: 2013-10-30 06:26:18
This is cool! But you have to put your private key into that website... They might be secretly recording them?? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:33:12
Wow this was a very nice report. That guy was actually very informed and accurate.
