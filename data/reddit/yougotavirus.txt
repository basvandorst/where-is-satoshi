you can run hitman pro without installing it and it will finish relly quick.
so there is no chance the guy givingyou the 0.335 btc was scamming you and gave you a link to a fake client?

well seems like you got a virus.
who sent you the satoshi and then the 0.335 btc? why did he send you the btc? where did you download multibit from?
let hitman pro do a virus scan.
use noscript when browsing and keep your software up-to-date through secunia psi or by using linux.

anything will be better than windows, but linux is even more secure than mac imho.
one thing that will work on all operating systems, including windows:
never run suspicious software as root/admin
use different user accounts for browsing and for bitcoin
that way a malicious software can't access your wallet files even if it infects your web browsing account.
for beginners i recommend installing ubuntu because that is incredibly easy (just remember to turn off amazon tracking in privacy settings).
installing skype there is as easy as checking the "partner repositories" option in the "software sources" window and clicking install in the "software center", or running three command line lines:
linux has gone a long way to consumer friendlyness. you don't download and install installers, instead you have a kind of app store where every software is listed and installed on a click of a button or by running a simple command. you should try it again, dual boot ftw :)

i think debian or archlinux are good choices because they have a big community.
ubuntu is probably the most convenient but there is some criticism about the company behind it but it is alright to get started. or you could use one of its clones like lubuntu/kubuntu/..
whatever you use, keep your system up-to-date, be careful what you run and i recommend using the NoScript addon in firefox on all platforms.

there is, in a way. actually even more than just a password.
but if you have a virus on your computer it can do anything it wants and will see all passwords you enter.
you could use online wallets and use your phone as 2FA.
but i recommend you install linux alongside windows and use that for linux business. it's really easy. the easiest thing is ubuntu's wubi installer but other linux distros would be better.
what file was that virus in? where did you have it from?

everyone's excited what's going to happen next. such adrenaline, no time for proofread!
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:28:57
so did hitman pro find anything?
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:30:04
are you sure you downloaded the original? there were fakes...

electrum (which is also a great brainwallet), multibit
i think there is a list on the bitcoin wiki. make sure you download via secure connection or check pgp signature.
use a different user account for bitcoin business and web browsing.
i recommend using the noscript addon.
always!! keep your system up-to-date.

60% of developers accept bitcoin tips \o/
but someone should ask linus why he doesn't want them. maybe it's just his spam filter?
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:24:41
i don't see how. and afaik chinese exchanges already prepared everything so nothing will change for them next week.
or is any of them still using a forbidden payment processor?
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:45:52
the [holy grail bounty]( of the open-transactions project maybe?
they work on decentralized currency exchanges or something.
@_date: 2014-01-26 12:04:45
for 100$ you could buy a cheap phone or pc and use it as offline wallet :)
or pay someone to install linux on your computer and show you how to use NoScript.
