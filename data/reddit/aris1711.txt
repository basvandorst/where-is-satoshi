That day they arrested two different people: Michell Espinoza y Pascal Reid, I'm trying to help Michell. And you are talking me about Reid. And let me tell you something: First a question -Do you live in Miami Beach? if no, so you don't know the police here, every day is a lot of false cases and charges and I know this is one of them. I'm trying to help Michell because I know him, and I was in the same situation in Miami Beach, the police is corrupt, they lie. They put me with marihuana charges (I never use it and I even smoke) and that was a felony, the result: NO ACTION because obviously that was a fake case

This is the arrest report, if you read you will see that a lot of things just don't match. And they have so poor information about Bitcoins and this fake case. And they put information about others cases trying to make this an strong case. So an inteligent person can see it

That part is okay, but my point is that he was charged with laundering money. And that was just because they proposed him to make a transaction for $30,000 dollars but he said "I will think about it" and he just did't accept the transaction. So they put him on jail with those false charges. This look more like a wich hunt because they arrested two different person that day, they are looking for Bitcoin users, they just want finish with it. There you have more information, thanks. And I know they are corrupt, because in the past some months ago they put me false charges because I did'n want lie agaisnt my boyfriend
