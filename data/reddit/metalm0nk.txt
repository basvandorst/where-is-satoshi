Absolutely. Now we just need them to actually regulate and keep surveillance on the markets actually in place.
Hint: They probably never will.

I love that Homeland Security is involved. 
Be careful for them Torrent Terrorists! They're the devil!

I'm aware that they do too much.
My point is, all of that was being done by our existing agencies and "Homeland Security"(For the Fatherland!) is a rapidly expanding operation that is literally stealing work from the FBI and CIA by being the two combined and then some.


Could be done by IRS and FBI as it was before HSI


FBI, CIA, and current copyright law take care of this. Especially since international and foreign laws over ride US law.
FBI, NSA, CIA


Obviously no one in the US can do this until they ACTUALLY/FINALLY close Gitmo and needless prisons like them; and stop using drones at weddings and parties. 
But in seriousness, USDOS and FBI.


You got me here. Guess this wasn't enough of a problem for the people in charge to create a department dealing with this problem before HSI.


DOT, DOI, IRS, FBI, CIA can all do this.


Does Operation Fast and Furious ring a bell?
Non-corrupties in these organizations that could help: FBI, CIA, Border Patrol, DOJ, DEA, and the ATF(It's like ALL they do)


Refer to above


BIS(Buearu of Industry and Security) and USDoC


FBI and CIA
In short, Homeland Security is nothing more than further expansion of the already largest police and military power in the world for nothing more than budget growth and to further create problems/intervene where not needed.
