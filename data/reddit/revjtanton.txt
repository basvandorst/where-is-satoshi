I found some through google, but I'm more or less looking for input on which are better or more trusted.  Trying to narrow down the search.  Another way to phrase my question is: where would anyone here go to find places to spend bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:18:12
I've been debating this too.  I decided I'd wait until the holidays and see if anything changed.

I've been mining for a while as a hobby, but recently noted that I could actually buy stuff now!  So, Friday, I went to overstock and figured I'd buy stuff...well their site didn't take bitcoin, so I double-checked the news.  Articles I found said they'd be taking bitcoin in the mid-point of the year.  "no worries" I thought.  I signed up for gyft, got an amazon gift card, and spent some coin!  The next day overstock started taking bitcoin!  But now I've spent all the money I wanted to spend right now!!! Argh!!!

This is fantastic, but I'm excited for the day where this branches out a bit.  Right now I'm really only seeing the tipping trend invade Once it catches on in other larger forums we could see bitcoin go more mainstream. 
One of the best ways for people to get into bitcoin is to give them some (IMO).  Give them a healthy amount they can spend, so give your friends a $20 paper wallet for Christmas instead of a card with a $20 bill inside.  Doing stuff like that, plus the tipping in small increments, will get more people involved and excited about it.

We shouldn't use that symbol, it's already used.

I feel like this will turn into internet pan-handling.

So I've been only casually following Gox this week so far.  Let me see if I get this straight:
1.) They move their office.
2.) They delete all their tweets.
3.) Their site is just blank.
I hope ya'll didn't want that money of yours that they had. I'm sorry about this.  I'm not being cynical or sarcastic, this is truley horrible.  At this point I'm concerned that no government will go after them since it was an "inherit risk of investing" or some bullshit like that.  This is fucked.

Time for Plan Baht?  I thought Thailand was anti-bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:26:28
Did that.  Most wiki's have edit text after you're logged in, or sometimes even when not.

There is a lot of speculation over all of this.  While I don't know if any of what you say here is at all accurate, you may not be far off from the truth.  The main thing I'm taking away from this is that some of this doesn't seem to add up, and the government *has* fucked with Gox in the past.  I think insolvency seems likely, but what caused the insolvency may not be as obvious as it seems.  Interesting theories.

I saw you were in PA and was excited.  Yeah, it's a big state....I'm very far away from you.

Nice!  That's great!  I'm trying to figure out how to post now.  Thanks :)

About 2 hours west of you, in Hanover, my wife accepts bitcoin for her photography business :)

What I like about this story (not the part about her carrying a gun...but what's the deal with that anyway) is that this is an instance of a failure in traditional news as is printed by a declining publication. She didn't validate what facts she thought she had, and now folks who will validate those facts are taking her to task for it.  By sheer volume the internet is the best validation tool that has ever existed for such things.  
I don't know if I have a point to my rant here, but I just find our evolution over the past 20 years or so fascinating.  The decline of print media, bitcoin, netflix....it's all just amazing!

Just because he's a bad developer it doesn't mean PHP is a bad language.  I'm offended.

In the same statement he says that it is an efficient way to transfer dollars.  Isn't that the point?  It's meant to be an online currency (useable offline too) and I for one have never seen it as a straight-up replacement for the US dollar or any nation's currency.  There was a time when individual banks issued notes (money), and then governments corralled them under a common currency.  Similarly bitcoin does that with the world's currency's.  Just like you can still get a line of credit from a bank individually bitcoin doesn't presume to replace all of the world's individual currencies or financial policies.  That's part of its appeal.

Maybe this is more an indetement on that shoddy journalism approach, and a tribute to the collective's ability to call bull-shit rather than actually doing the journalism itself?  
Don't get me wrong: I'm not at all impressed with the journalist, Newsweek, or (the few) people in this community who've gone on a witch hunt.  I'm impressed generally with the Internet's ability to cry bull-shit, and prove it so quickly (which is what the vast majority of this community has done).  It's almost like truth is losing relative perspective and is becoming objective truth?  I dunno.  
Good question on Satoshi.  If it *was* someone named Satoshi why wouldn't they change that part of their name if they wanted privacy?  That part made no sense to me.  And the "journalism" to discover who the guy was amounted to a Google search of people named Satoshi...It's not the most sophisticated way to hide one's identity, which seems a bit off for a person who started off bitcoin.  Then again maybe he/she didn't think it would take off anyway, so they weren't all that concerned with their identity.  It could also be a tribute?  I'm in the boat that thinks it doesn't really matter anyway, but it is an interesting story all the same.

Step 1 is steal underpants, step 2 is ????, step 3 is profit.  Step 7 is correct though.

I think until the day comes where we truly view bitcoin as a currency and not an investment we're subject to wild fluxuations every so often.  As more major retailers accept it for payment, and the mining difficulty gets higher, we'll see that happen.  The question is where will the value settle?  I'm betting that it'll settle much higher than it is now, so another slight crash would only benefit us who're buying/mining/trading now. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:26:04
Not at all.  I'm not referencing regulation, but penalties for theft.  Gox is taking people's money and running, that isn't a regulation issue.  The currency isn't the problem here.
