I'm impressed to see such a coherent response from a government agency.

I keep seeing posts like this and cant help but thinking that impoverished third world countries aren't exactly going to be the flag bearers of a new financial construct that -requires- constant, omnipresent internet access on a smart device.

Yeah its a huge pain in the ass to buy in Australia, don't pay attention to the "financing options" in btc-e such as OkPay Liqpay etc. Took me over a month and my money disappeared before giving up and using coinjar. They trade parity to Gox and you lose a bit transferring them to btc-e so I'd wait until the gap between Gox and Btc-e is lower (happens most weekends)Edit: downvoted for helping?
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:24:30

@_date: 2014-02-17 21:33:10
Depends which country OP resides in. I doubt he's 'kidding' with the paper reference, something tells me the point of this thread is the satirical article. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:24:12
I giggled.

Yeah, good attempt at an example but it fell apart. Decent question though as i was unaware of it, I'm interested in hearing an answer?

OP have you tried using this to pick up? Maybe you're on to something
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:49:36
I think its a kind of snowball effect. The first five people were legitimately enraged, the rest just saw the number and tagged in. I saw 55 downvotes for a random comment and laughed. Then downvoted him.
@_date: 2014-01-05 00:25:26
Use coinjar.io to buy bitcoins, then transfer to btc-e.com, easy. Nobody uses MtGox.Edit: people will tell you to use coinbase, good luck with that in Australia. Coinjar.io is the same thing, with NAB deposits.

"no way to know how deeply its been compromised"..."you cant uninfect windows"So, every single piece of malware, irrespective of severity is in fact a system wide endgame Trojan that requires a full system cleanse by fire? You're an idiot.

Given that the email came from an internal address, he's almost certainly bullshitting you. Post this to your blog, call his bluff. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 09:27:32
Everyone here is smarter than the fool who sold his bitcoins at $25 and $35 and can't get over it. So he keeps coming back and trash-talks about the thing he gave up, the thing that keeps going, leaving you behind.You're like a bitter ex-boyfriend posting shit about a hot ex-girlfriend on facebook. Get over it. You sound too desperate.
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:10:53

Again, you bitch and moan about -everything- on this subreddit. Simply due to the scale and effort you put in here, you're going to get something right eventually. Doesn't make you a prophet. Also you're wrong.

If only you had used a different account, given that anything coming from Darkwings_08 is flagged as retarded
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:57:09
I'll second this post, coinjar took a week or two and a public ticket before verifying my account around the same time, but overall its a very intuitive and useful service.
@_date: 2014-01-16 06:29:28
This is the first time ive seen one of your posts on the wall, you made it 29 seconds ago and i just happened to check before it was downvoted to oblivion. Maybe i should buy a lottery ticket.

tl;dr Its a Darkwings_08 post.Sum it up for me?
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:01:06
Really? I made a stupid thread a couple of days ago and now its just sitting there, a blight on my beautiful profile.

Again Darkwings_08...there is one person in this thread. I feel bad for you bro
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:40:54
Ranting about bitcoins demise every-single-day, you're going to be right at least a couple of times. Also you're a pain in the ass for making me type out a response instead of just copypasting that paragraph about how you're a bitter moron who traded all his coins for neckbeard cream at $25 i normally leave on all your posts.

There are four people in here...is your world so lonely that you collectively refer to four out of 87,000+ on this subreddit as 'all'? When was the last time you spoke to another human being? I bet you're not very fun to be around since you found out all those coins you sold in 2012 could have changed your life.

Darkwings! Always good to see you around, means you're trying to make something more negative than it actually is on your  fuck-i-traded-all-my-bitcoins-for-neckbeard-cream-back-in-2010-so-now-i-need-to-ruin-everyones-fun quest. Reaffirms my confidence in bitcoin to know you're still kicking.

Tbh, if i hadn't bothered to research after the November rally I'd likely have laughed during the December correction as well. I invested instead and cried in December, but made it all back, then lost it Rinse repeat.

I wondered why i never come across your links in the main view...then realised its because all the shit you post gets downvoted so hard it never see's the light of day. Its a good system, i approve of it
