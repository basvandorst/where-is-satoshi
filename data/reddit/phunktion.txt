I think they already did support it at one point and then removed it

Brian is the founder and was once the sole engineer, building the initial product. I wouldn't classify him as non-technical.

It much harder to get participants to value an inflationary currency over a deflationary one. People buy bitcoin today in hopes that it will rises in value over time, but its very value that give Bitcoin it's utility. If the will always be more new coins created  there there is no incentive to buy or hold and the value would plummet, then the transaction network loses its purpose.
And yes the government and banking system can legislate whatever they want with threat of force but it still doesn't make it more attractive.

we all know that blockchain can be used for other kinds of data, but you are still failing to name whats the incentive for encouraging others for securing the their blockchain.
If they are going to mine it themselves how is this better then putting some database on a server behind some authentication? is it cheaper, more secure?

great analogy. stealing this

I know one of the founders is that worth anything. I believe they are legit. They are not anonymous and have been in the press
@_date: 2014-10-08 20:31:26
Sure they can and have ( see various altcoins )
But lets say for the sake of argument that IBM creates its own blockchain for Internet of Things. Would it need others to mine the blocks for them? would they be incentivized  to do so? an new coin, how are these new coins valued? would they just do direct deposits of USD into the miners bank accounts. If so why not just run all the nodes and do the work securing the blockchain themselves? why even have a blockchain, why not create a private secure network
@_date: 2014-10-08 20:33:33
Yes, but the currency is the incentive that makes the whole thing possible. Why bother securing the network if there is nothing in it for me?
@_date: 2014-10-08 23:24:29
angry much? you said a whole lot with a lot of vitriol but I think you failed to make your case.
Maybe I am not seeing the big picture, and you are much smarter than me so please enlighten. I am only 12 as you pointed out.
A trustless distributed consensus ledger as a communication tool is useless it is open and not proprietary. Just read the article on their plan. Their main reason stated is to use a blockchain instead of creating their own network is cost. It would be much cheaper then running their own network.
Whats not stated is how this IoT blockchain will be secured. Who gets to create new blocks and why? what prevents any dickwad from creating a new blocks? whats the incentive for even creating blocks? is there Proof of work? a lot of unanswered questions.

I think you messed up your steaks and woks. 
I get what you are saying. But up to this point no POS coins have gained any traction. Why?  Are there some unsolved problems or just bitcoin's network effects? is POW mining more attractive that POS?
@_date: 2015-08-21 03:00:10
that may be more prone to fraud?
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:12:18

right now its just one guy. what if they want to add more developers and marketing? 250k is like 3 employees for one year
@_date: 2015-09-13 06:10:53
There is no evidence that they ever communicated in any public forum? correct?
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:47:20
the point is don't assume bitcoin will be a success. it will not change the world because you believe it will, you need to get out there the contribute to it's success.
its not a honey badger. its not some unstoppable force. sucess is not guaranteed

35000 words, takes a while to get through which is why I assume most people didn't even read it.
 Its very revealing but with an ambiguous outcome. The author comes away unsure himself. IMO it does not eliminate Wright as  Satoshi even though the whole community says it's impossible.

I hate you. 
I was considering doing a 5-10k investment in them when they did a round on fundersclub.com but got cold feet. Seeing your number makes me regret that choice

That map is a fraud. My company is listed there, only because me an my partners wanted to buy bitcoin back in 2011. We never once accepted payment from anyone using dwolla. I wonder how many of the others listed there are for the same reason. Most of the business do not sound like store fronts that you can walk into and buy stuff with Dwolla. I wonder how many others are just businesses who created accounts but never used them

I keep failing my identity verification as well.
Maybe i have missed one or two questions since some the them reference stuff from 10 years ago but I am sure I have answered them all right at least once

I tried to buy something with Bitpay using Coinbase. The transaction never hit the blockchain and the 15 minute window from Bitpay expired.
Bitpay says don't send any funds to the provided address after expiration.
I have no way to cancel the transaction on Coinbase. What happens if its does go through days late? will Bitpay still honor the payment?
whatever happens it going to be a headache

I supposedly have 2 btc on the android app installed ages ago and ahve it been able to get them out
When i go to the  phones download folder in windows I don't see any key files

cant wait, i'll be ready to buy at the bottom

I am going to just copypasta this every time someone bitcoin doesn't have value
Bitcoin has value because it has properties that make it useful, therefore people want it. For instance it solves the [Byzantine Generals' Problem](
Gold itself is not valuable because of it's utility ( which is limited ) but because it has properties that make it a useful as a store of value ( scarcity, fungible, hard to counterfeit, etc )
Bitcoin has these same properties, but it also is better than gold in many ways

the chart description says 'The graph showing miners revenue minus estimated electricity and bandwidth costs.'
but what about the costs of hardware and diminishing returns as difficulty rises? That's what makes it a losing proposition vs just buying btc
this is where the numbers are coming from
 * Electricity consumption is estimated based on power consumption of 650 Watts per gigahash and electricity price of 15 cent per kilowatt hour. In reality some miners will be more or less efficient.
 ** For profit margin hardware costs are estimated to be $1000 per gigahash every 2 years, and bandwidth $1 per gigahash per year.

I mean will i be flagged as a money launderer if i bought some for you?
Is it against TOS on Gox, Dwolla or elsewhere?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:03:55
it's accurate
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:07:30
but they are demoninated in bitcoin, so if bitcoin is rising stock prices will go down even if they are holding steady
@_date: 2013-03-23 18:01:21
thanks, I haven't tried to contact bitpay yet because I don't know whats going on with coinbase
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:06:10
I am verified on Gox and helped a friend buy some btc there quickly. Am I breaking any rules by doing this.? Am I exposing myself to risk?
I was wondering if it would be smart to help others with such transactions (for a small fee )
