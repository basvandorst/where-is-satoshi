Ha! I was about to post the same.  Except mine has been stuck in the memepool since 31st December 2017 - 5 days and counting now.  In theory, I've read that it can be stuck there up to 14 days.  If the block is not confirmed, each transaction is "returned to sender" (back to sending wallet) - can anyone confirm this?

I'm 5 days and counting.

My BTC has been stuck in the memepool since 31st December 2017 - 5 days and counting.  How long have you been waiting? Your money is not lost, but the delay might or might not have an opportunity cost for you associated with it.

I moved the BTC from cex.io exchange to kucoin exchange - I have no such ability to do anything with this transaction.  The date of the block is 31st December 2017 - that means it hasn't been rebroadcast right?

Isn't XRP trying to solve this problem?

Always think like this: the BTC price in December 2018 will make the BTC price in July 2018 look cheap.  The BTC price in July 2018 will make the BTC price in March 2018 look cheap.  the BTC price in March 2018 will make the BTC price in November 2017 look cheap. 
You're in way earlier than those millions of nubes in 2018. 
$100,000 a coin in 2020.  
Don't sweat the dips, and Glen hodl all the way.  Easiest way to do it.

I stopped looking at the price but am now addicted to push-ups - doing 10,000 pushups a day.  In fact, I hate looking at the price now as my coins are in the red.  So for every 10 push-ups I do, I will check the price of my coins.

And BTC isn't centrally controlled by Chinese miners...no, of course not.  Also, look at the BCH fork debacle.  Do not throw stones in glasshouses.

Yes, xRapid officially went live on 1st October 2018.
