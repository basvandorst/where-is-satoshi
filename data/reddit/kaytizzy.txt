Love this move, the equity in your house was not doing anything for you. BTC has constantly gone up in the long run and it is being used more and more each day. Dont pay attention to the short term ups and downs and just HODL, we will prevail in the long run.

Rebel kept bringing it up when Hathaway talked about how much money she had. Then at the end of the movie Rebel sent all her btc to a guy in the movie. She did it on her phone, didnt actually show it, she just said she was sending it to him.

Yes, 100 percent. Like yesterday my dad said a stock of his had a really good day. I asked how much it went up and he said almost 2%. Its just funny that that was considered really good, if bitcoin goes up 2% in a day then its being boring to most people haha.

They dont understand it. Also most people dont know that you can buy less than one. When they hear bitcoin is 10k+ they get jealous that they cant buy one so they talk bad about it because of jealousy (rooting from the fact that they dont know much about it). Oh and also they listen to the stupid stuff the media says about it, my coworkers are convinved bitcoin is for illegal stuff.

Are you still around? What’s the best longshot coin for us to get into? Any big super gains from the bottom to like a top 50 coin?
