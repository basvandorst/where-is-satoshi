Acceptance where? There aren't a lot of retailers that take Bitcoin seriously

Insurance far from covers everything though. What happens when you're taken to a hospital that doesn't accept your insurance?

People like you think roads are just hunks of asphalt don't you?

$400 if you're lucky.
And let's say you aren't able to pay for it. You go deep into debt and you go on welfare. Now you're using government money anyway.
Sure the state being nannies is why they can't afford $400. It's not anything else.

By nature, it should be considered. People cannot often control which hospital they go to if they have a heart attack.
And apparently there is something like an out of network doctor.

My taxes would pay for other things than just hospital related expenses.
Do you think the extra taxes for health care would be more than a massive hospital bill + insurance costs? Never mind the mental bonus of never worrying about a crippling debt brought on all at once.

Getting sick isn't the only thing that sends people to hospitals. Broken arms, car accidents, etc. send people to the emergency room all the time. And with the majority of Americans not having substantial savings, I'd prefer not to take a gamble that I would be ended by a bill.
Real question: is there an insurance policy that applies in every possible situation? No "out of network" garbage?
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:19:02
Right. Because a hospital bill is always going to be the same as taxes.

A mod of Wikileaks is promoting a conspiracy? *gasp* no one saw this coming.

A city with 3x the national average of violent crime had a violent crime happen?
I can't believe it.
