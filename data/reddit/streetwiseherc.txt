beer 
I find your investigation into the matter to be quite interesting to follow. I think you're quite thorough and fair.
I think it comes down to something quite simple, what *verifiable* percentage of each $1 (or Bitcoin if you please) that Sean's Outpost receives goes towards helping the homeless?  It's the gold standard that allows potential donors to decide on whether they feel their donation is helping the homeless or is helping the person who is soliciting donations.  Of course it's a subjective number.  One person might not mind if the solicitor is keeping 50 cents of every dollar donated, but others might feel that this is disingenuous and prefer to donate to a more efficient cause.
Thanks again. 
EDIT: Apparently Thursday's beers are more expensive than Wednesday's beers.  Hopefully fixed and there is enough money to buy an actual beer or root beer if not.

I don't see why it has to be above a certain dollar value or below a certain dollar value to be considered successful?  Isn't stability and adoption more important?  Adoption by retailers and service providers seems to be quite high compared to just a year ago. The value against the dollar is way more stable than a year ago also.  The problem I see is consumer adoption, i.e. making a Bitcoin purchase more attractive than alternatives (Credit Card, Paypal, Cash).  Right now there isn't really a tangible incentive to acquiring Bitcoin (which usually has a fee), and safely holding on to it before a purchase is made.  Unless you're buying something "anonymously" of dubious legality (don't get me wrong, I think drugs should be legal).
And so what if it never dominates the world's current top currency (for how many more years will this be the USD?!)?  Does Bitcoin have to have a universal acceptance in order for it to be worthwhile?  I don't think so... unless you're someone who's holding onto a few and expect to become incredibly wealthy by speculation.  IMHO, speculators (whether small or large companies taking in angel investor's money) bring more harm to the Bitcoin movement.

Go go ahead and do it if you think it's such a novel idea.  
* People who already know about Bitcoin won't care because they will know how futile "guessing" a private key is.  
* People that don't know anything about Bitcoin will quickly lose interest after they visit your site and click "ROLL THE DICE" 10 times and don't win anything.  Do you know anything about casino gambling?  People become addicted to gambling (slots, cards, dice, whatever) because the rules are well known and they can either occasionally win themselves or see others win (but not enough to drain the House's profits).
* People that are smart enough to write bots or automated programs to "guess" your private keys would be too smart to do so, because they'd know it was a futile effort.  (Unless of course you were foolish enough to create a downloadable app that had your "secret" private key in it for client-side validation.)
I personally think this would create absolutely ZERO buzz, but if you have the technical chops to set it up, I say go ahead and prove everyone wrong.

Sorry, but you're too late to the party to mine Bitcoin on PC hardware. If you want to mine Bitcoin, you're going to need to spend thousands on specialized hardware and electricity. 
If you really want to get into Bitcoin then you're better off buying them using one of the exchanges linked to in the Getting Started link at right.
Here's an entertaining video on Bitcoin mining...

Based on what?  Because you gambled early?  I could see if you were the guy who invented Bitcoin, or built a service on top of Bitcoin, but if you're a Bitcoin 1%er only because you gambled (oh, I mean... "invested") early, then... I hardly think you're more deserving than anyone else.

They just had $5 million in BTC (possibly even more) stolen out from under their noses.  They should fully expect every single competent user with BTC still in their exchange, to remove it as soon as possible.  They are done as a business. Only a fool who didn't care about their BTC would trust the security of their code/system at this point.

That's actually quite an interesting video on SPAM in general.
I think it's hilarious that Facebook thinks it's going to get $1 Billion from this guy.  Fuck this guy.  Fuck spam.  Fuck some anti-spam US law. Fuck Facebook.
I don't deal with email spam anymore.  Even the most basic Junk Filters have pretty much solved that problem.  Most of my "spam" comes from "legit" companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and all the rest of the websites that send you craploads of shit e-mail by default until you go an disable it.
Bottom Line = SPAM wouldn't exist if dummies weren't buying penis pills and discount Viagra.  I blame the dummies that buy it nearly as much as the dummies that send it.

I won't insult your intelligence and try to explain to you how anyone could make up fictitious expenses and dollar amounts.
Every legitimate charity in the world attempts to provide a detailed and audited record of where every dollar donated goes to. 
As a purely hypothetical experiment, of every $1 you donated to Sean's Outpost what amount would be comfortable with going towards making the homeless a sandwich:
A) $1.00  B) $0.75 C) $0.50 D) $0.25 E) $0.00
Feel free to submit a number that is not on the list.

As others have already said, this will probably fail when the company runs out of seed money to give away (to potentially dishonest exercisers).
There might be something to having a service where a fitness-challenged individual gives the company $100 of his/her own dollars and has to workout to "earn" it back (or the company keeps it as a penalty after a period).  This idea of a "reward", even using your own money, can be motivating for some who are trying to lose weight.  I wouldn't bank on something like that becoming a huge thing though...

With Bitcoin you're able to call up 1-800-BLOCK-CHAIN and dispute fraudulent orders made with your Bitcoin or orders that a merchant never shipped.  With a credit card, you're simply out the lost money and there's nothing you can do about it.  I don't know why any BONEHEAD consumer would ever use a credit card or a bank?!

You could almost replace "Evolution" with "Wall Street Investment Firms who Invested in Mortgage Backed Securities", "Bitcoin" with "Savings, Investments, Retirement Funds, Pensions, etc" and "tens of millions of dollars" with "billions and billions of dollars".
They should make drug trade legal or make stock trading illegal to at least even things out.
