No because you'll still be paying the interest.  The tax deduction just reduces the amount of income on which you'll have to pay taxes.

Dumb question - why would the copier be built with the ability to store tens of thousands of pages on a hard drive?  If the ostensible purpose is just to buffer a print or scan job, wouldn't a much smaller hard drive that overwrites each job with the next be the perfect solution?

To answer  I say it has been fairly easy to use coinbase, although it is frustrating that it takes a very long time to process transactions.  Other exchanges and options have distinct disadvantages, such as needing a bank wire, in-person meetings, etc.
As to  I would say the wallet concept is by far the most challenging.  This is because you more or less have to understand the whole system to  understand wallets, and the wallet topic itself is full of both highly complex technical topics (cryptography, etc.) and the possibility of having your coins stolen.  Imagine if, to open a bank account, you needed a full understanding of bank software, routing systems, etc. AND if you made the slightest misstep your money could be completely gone.

Kashmir Hill, the reporter, covers bitcoin regularly and is supportive of it. I don't think she's mocking the statement but I don't think the source was taking himself too seriously either.

There are plenty of non-tax reasons to choose DE as your state of incorporation.  Plus, OP is outside of the U.S. - what state of incorporation would be acceptable to you?
