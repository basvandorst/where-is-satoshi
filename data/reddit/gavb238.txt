Taxation is theft. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:13:54
CNBC should stay swat from crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:51:46
Sounds like it’s time to close accounts with them.

Why? Did the tech failed?
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:43:32
Be really careful with Argentinians. They will rob you and you won’t even notice. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:28:14
Don’t forget to pay your taxes on crypto.
