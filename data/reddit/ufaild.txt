The bitcoin wealth distribution is already better than the global wealth distribution, and it's getting better all the time with a few exceptions.
There's no easy way to buy massive amounts of bitcoin at a reasonable price, the liquidity is quite low.
Bitcoin is an opt-in system, anybody can get some. Most of the freshly printed fiat money is distributed to the bankers. The entry bar into the banking industry is pretty damn high.
Ideally it would be awesome to distribute coins evenly among ALL the people in the world, but that's practically impossible.

Burning Bitcoins doesn't require much computing power at all. You simply send them to an address that nobody has private keys for. You can simply generate any random valid address, and it's guaranteed by statistics that you will never generate private keys for it (normally wallet addresses are derived from private keys).

So your friend receives a wallet, and then what? He still needs to install an app and import the wallet. That's harder than just installing the app, which auto-creates a wallet (which is how most Bitcoin clients work now).
The second problem is that you will have to send the wallet encrypted, and will face a problem of securely sharing the password with your friend.
The third problem is that you now have access to his private keys. Even if you're completely honest and he completely trusts you, if you get compromised, he will lose all the money, and you will be the one responsible.

Because market cap does NOT reflect the total amount of money put into it. In fact, there's no reliable metric for that.
Market cap is a rather stupid metric, it's the total number of coins multiplied by the latest trade price.
Let's say the bitcoin price is $700 for simplicity sake.
The bitcoin market cap would be
    700 * 12,474,025 = 8.73 billion dollars
If I now buy at the lowest available sell offer of $701, the market cap would jump up by 12.474 million dollars.
In fact, I don't even have to buy a whole coin for that.
Tiny purchases can change the market cap significantly. If you want to have exact numbers, look at the *market depth* of big exchanges, and be amazed how little money you need to move the price (and thus the market cap) *a lot*.

Wrong. Maybe it doesn't matter in the US, but there are many countries where their stupid monetary policies caused high inflation or hyperinflation. Venezuela, Argentina, Belarus, Iran, and many others.


Wat??? You clearly have never used bitcoin for payment. It's as easy as scanning a QR code and clicking "confirm".


That's exactly why good stored with good return policies, like Amazon, will survive and prosper, and the shitty ones will drown in a flood of bad reviews. The internet catches onto bad stores pretty quickly.

Try getting a credit card. It's pretty insane these days. You have to start with a prepaid debit card with a $500 limit for 6 months until you get credit history. Then you might get a credit card with the same limit for another 6 months.

If you want to buy anything over the limit, you're fucked. It doesn't matter if you have $100,000 in your bank account, you're still fucked.
Buying bitcoins is actually easy. You can do it in a few hours, just go on localbitcoins. If you don't mind waiting a couple of weeks, get verified on any exchange and wire the money there. I've done it many times, it's trivial.

There will likely be banks that would pay you a small percentage for keeping your bitcoins. They aren't the same. Current CD/savings rates are so low, they don't cover the inflation/QE. You essentially lose money in your "savings" account.

I was just referring to the fact that it's not some magical secret method. It's arbitrage, you buy at price X in one place, move the money to another place and (hopefully) sell for more than X.
It's doable, but there are multiple problems standing in the way.
1) what if you buy at 550, move bitcoin, but the price falls to 540? What do you do? Take a loss? Wait and hope it goes back up?
2) fees. There are deposit and withdrawal and trade fees. They will eat some of your profits.
3) you will have to move fiat back and forth from- and to exchanges. You might be able to do it a few times until your bank/PayPal/FinCen notices it and blocks you. You need a money transmitter license for that.
4) you need a lot of money to make decent profits. Each full cycle or arbitrage takes days if you do it through the bank. 
People have done it. Some profited, some lost money.

You clearly don't understand how markets work. It doesn't take a billion dollars to increase the market cap by a billion dollars. You think it does because you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what market cap is. It is NOT the total sum of money put into it.
What you should really be looking is the market depth on the biggest exchanges. It sakes surprisingly little to move the price. 
For instance it would only take $13 million dollars to move the price to $1000 on Bitstamp.

@_date: 2014-01-02 17:07:36
Yeah, and you need a shitton of BTC to run something like that, otherwise you can't guarantee the price. That's why you guys don't want to buy them on an exchange, because that would drive the price to the moon. And that's exactly why you're looking for high btc holders, to strike off the exchange deals.
I don't think you guys are fooling anybody here, it's pretty clear what you are trying to do.

No way. There are buy orders all the way to the current price. If somebody were to put  in a sell order at $102 (very stupid), any non-retarded exchange would simply match it with the lowest buy in the $600+ range, and take the difference for themselves.
Would that count as a $102 transaction? I don't think it should.

Actually it's not. You don't need to spend 1 billion dollars worth in order to increase the price so the market cap increases by 1 billion.

So either you don't have any savings or you invest them into stocks.
Bitcoin solves that problem - no need to bother with researching stocks and taking risks, it's deflationary by design (or will be in a couple of decades to be precise).
You can't trust fiat with your savings, so you jump through hoops and waste time researching stocks and gambling. Most people suck at investing. Heck, most fund managers suck at picking stocks. You might be a rare genius who beats the stock market, but most people aren't.

The traceability of bitcoin is largely a myth. The only thing you can trace is the money moving from wallet A to wallet B, and so on. And only if the money doesn't get mixed.

Encrypt your wallet with a long random password. If you're paranoid, put it inside an encrypted zip file with a different password. Then simply email it to yourself, your family, save it on hard drives, USB keys, etc.
Store the passwords in something like Keepass, and email the Keepass database in a similar way. Make sure somebody else knows the password to keepass, in case you die your bitcoins can be used by the family.

All these exchanges are really a convenient meet up place for buyers and sellers. And yes, they do sit on a bunch of cash and BTC , most of it not theirs. Most of btc is stored in a wallet outside of the exchange to prevent a massive loss in case of a hack.
Cash sits in some bank account. In case of Bitstamp the bank is in Slovenia.

Mining is self-correcting. If it becomes too expensive, some miners will quit and the difficulty would drop, which, as far as I remember, had happened in the past.
Bitcoin cost is not tied to mining cost in any way.

You can't buy 1m BTC at $1000. Look at the market depth on any exchange. Even buying 15k BTC will amount to all available BTC on Bitstamp and will drive the price above $3500.
MtGox has fewer than 26k BTC for sale, and buying them would drive the price to almost $7000.
The number of BTC for sale is actually pretty low.
Buying 1m BTC is a nontrivial project. You can do it slowly and you will still drive the price up tremendously.

No, you said that no orders can be submitted while others execute, which is false.

The main problem with this scheme is getting the page number data, which I don't believe is accessible for most of the books.
Once you have that data, it becomes trivial. You just map all the n-word lists to wallet addresses and private keys. Then you put all these wallet addresses into an efficient lookup structure, like a map or a rainbow table. Then you run your bitcoin server and lookup the destination of all the transactions once every 10 minutes.
It's a lot of data, but it will run on a moderately beefy PC just fine.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:19:24
That makes zero sense. You are in the same exact business, you are competing with them by definition. You only say this nonsense because they beat your ridiculous prices so badly. Your servers are not magical or artisan, they are likely exactly the same.
Sorry, but you sound completely incompetent, you don't understand your own business.

You realize that there are hundreds of other factors besides production costs (mining) and speculation that determine the price of... anything? Probably not.
You are trying to ignore one of the most important factors - demand, and then getting surprised that btc value does not match your expectations. Dumb dumb dumb dumb.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:31:30
It all depends on when you can start mining and the price of BTC.
Neither is predictable.
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:14:36
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:05:30
No, orders are not atomic and they are not executed in chronological order. 
You can see it for yourself. Let' say the best seller price is 850 and that best seller is only selling 1btc, place a buy order at 850 for 3btc. Your order will partially execute at 1btc and you will have a hanging order at 850 for 2btc, until some other seller offers it at that (or better) price.

It's worth it if you can find an exchange that trades both and BTC, or use two exchanges, assuming their deposit/ withdrawal fees are low.
If you just wire one currency into another, the bank will screw you over on the conversion rate, likely at least 3%.
