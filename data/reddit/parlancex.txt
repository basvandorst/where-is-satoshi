Do you know if this is possible to implement with bitcoin output scripts?

Can we get some clarification for question? Do we have access to the secondary Bitalo keys to put them in our own cold storage? Otherwise it's more of a suicide pact than anything else.

We do, and he's even formally apologized for it. "Mea Culpa". He's wewey, wewey, sowwy.
You can choose to believe him, but we already know the NSA has recruited agents to work within the open source community _exactly_ for this kind of purpose. We also know that the extension he was implementing was also _his_ standards proposal. We already know that his proposal wasn't approved, or even standards tracked, and was implemented in OpenSSL anyway. And finally, we know that the extension, basically an application layer keep-alive is completely redundant and purposeless, as even the very small number of applications that use UDP-based transport with TLS generally implement their own transport layer with their own keep-alive.

Oh come on. That might put it out of reach of Joe Hacker, but what about organized national entities or legal forces? There's speculation that Mt. Gox may have lost control over their cold storage due to legal seizure from any number of US and non-US government and non-government entities. Given what we know about the capabilities of some of these entities recently, it really isn't a far-fetched argument.
The bottom line is that your system as is may not entrust the coins themselves to Bitalo, but they entrust the killswitch for their coins to Bitalo. I for one would not be prepared to accept that risk.

I'm not saying ONLY the user has both keys, I'm saying the user and Bitalo should both have one key, and only the user has the second key. Unfortunately you'd have to trust the user to back up the shared key to offline cold storage.
The alternative if I am understand you correctly is if Bitalo is wiped out or hacked, the coins could not be stolen, but would be effectively destroyed. Same result really, for all intents and purposes.

Well we're really back to square one then eh? This really doesn't provide any more security than Gox did.
The bottom line is that your personal wallet and exchange escrow need to be separate services, and your coins in escrow will always be at risk, period.

Like I said earlier in this thread, with a multi-sig address whoever seizes Bitola's keys couldn't steal your coins, but they could destroy them, which is effectively the same result to you.
I doubt the blockchain.info page showing them sitting there for all enternity would bring me much comfort.

Because to some extent you do have actual needs; non-optional spending. The fantastic thing about deflationary spending is it requires consumers to delineate necessary spending vs greed, which is the polar opposite of our current spending culture. Deflationary currencies promote prudence, pragmatism, and conservationism, all of which are almost completely foreign ideals in our "spend everything, borrow as much as possible, buy things we don't really need" society that is currently desperately trying to run this Earth into the ground.

How is Bitalo different from Blockchain.info's wallet system in which your private keys are encrypted both server side, and client-side with one or more passwords?
