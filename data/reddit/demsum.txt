Read his comment history. Everything bad in his life is either the fault of greedy corporate uber, bitcoin, or Trump. He has no sense of personal responsibility he just wants everyone to listen to his hourly tantrums on how he's down 40%. He and I went back and forth about it and he has no grip on reality nor personal responsibility, it's all everybody else's fault and he loves playing the victim.

Jesus man, I just looked through your post history and it's nothing but "poor pitiful me" all day long. You've probably posted how you are down 40% 20 times today. We get it, losing money sucks. If you spent 1/4 of the time you spend on reddit trying to better yourself instead of whining on here hoping the Fix It Fairy would come along you probably wouldn't be sleeping in your car. Sorry to be a  dick but sometimes life sucks, no-one and no amount of whining will fix it. Posting 8X per hour on reddit all day long damn sure isn't going to fix it. Only you can.

Continue blaming the world(Uber, bitcoin whales, etc. etc.) for your problems because then you aren't responsible for your situation and then you can feel justified.  Denial is a hell of a drug "I'm not the problem, the world is out to get me."  I have probably been too harsh and I apologize for that. You're right, I shouldn't make fun of someone sleeping in their car.  I don't think being positive will fix everything for you but I KNOW spending all of your free time on reddit griping about it won't fix anything.  Spend that time looking for something better, read books, educate yourself, do things to better your life rather than tell people how bad it is and you'll be surprised how quickly things do improve.


I didn't say that. I was raised that when you sign up for a job, whether it be for $1/day or $2000/day. You signed up for that job. You give them your full days work and if you are unhappy with the deal, find a better one.

I didn't know that Uber forced you out of your home and into your car to make you drive for shit wages (I guess in your case they would just have to wake you up and force you to start driving). I'm sorry, I was under the assumption that you possibly chose your "profession".  You signed up for the deal, if it's a shitty deal and you don't like it, find something else.  Regardless of what the terms and conditions are, you signed up for it.  I don't believe a corporation is above much of anything in regards to trying to maximize their profits.  If they can get you to drive for pennies while they get the dollars of course they are.  Is it fair? No.  But as long as people are willing to work for peanuts, they will continue the practice.  "Grow a brain" lol, I'm not sleeping in my car because I chose to live in an extremely high cost locale for less than minimum wage. All the while whining all day to everyone that can read about your losses in bitcoin that you obviously couldn't afford to invest in the first place.  You FOMO'd in at the top, thinking you were going to make a quick buck, it didn't work out.  Move along.

I'm basing my opinion off of your past posts, I haven't seen you say anything positive at all in any of them. Forgive me, I only looked like 5 pages back in your post history (so, like 3-4 hours worth) but between how horrible uber is (you speak for they entire LA community on that point, though people in your same market argue your numbers leading me to believe you are the problem) and how much you've lost in bitcoin because you FOMO'd at the top, all you do is complain. Own it, put the phone down and work on improving things.  I honestly hope the best for you and hope that you get things turned around but tough truths are sometimes what we need to hear, I've had a lot of them in my life.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:49:22
Not nearly as much as you enjoy wallowing in self pity.

The truth is, most of us are still figuring out how to report it. I had 10 hours of CPE in 18 on reporting crypto and got a lot of contradictory information. FIFO seems to be the best option.
@_date: 2019-06-13 19:30:09
Close. If, when you sold at $120 you only reinvested your profits ($20) then your new basis would be $20. If you bought back in with all of it, your new basis would be $120 (your original $100 + $20 of reported gain).
I don't know about most other preparers, but I only have a few clients that have ventured into the crypto space.  Out of ~500 returns that I have done so far this year maybe 5 or 6 had crypto to report and most of them only had a couple of transactions.
@_date: 2019-06-13 14:25:31
But you are cashing out. You may be reinvesting your gains and not sending to your bank account but you are cashing out with every trade. You are realizing the gain by being able to buy more coin. At the end of all that if you had 5 BTC and sold it, you would recognize any gain over your basis. You're not reporting all of the previous transactions again, just the last sale of 5 BTC at whatever basis you ended up at after all of the trades. Sale price - basis = gain(loss)
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:24:20
Crypto is treated as a capital asset. Pretty much everything but buying and transferring amongst your wallets is a taxable event. Buy ETH and then exchange it for BTC? That is a sale and you will have a reportable either long or short term gain(loss) and the sale price is the basis in the acquired BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:45:16
Yes, every single day trade is a reportable event. 
Ex. Bought 1 BTC at 7K, sold at 8K ($1000 gain), bought back in 1.0667 at 7500, sold at 8250 for 8800 ($800 gain). Making the assumption all is sold in each transaction.
So in those 2 trades you would have $1800 worth of gain to report and your basis in whatever BTC you ended up with at the end of that would be $8800.
Edit: Also, since they were day trades they would be short term and taxed at ordinary income rates.

Thank you for linking me to the 4684 instructions. Did you read them?  You are asking for advice but ignoring what you don't want to hear. From the pub you linked, first paragraph 


losses. Personal casualty and theft losses of 
an individual sustained in a tax year beginning 
after 2017 are deductible only to the extent 
they're attributable to a federally declared 
disaster. The loss deduction is subject to the 
$100 limit per casualty and 10% of your 
adjusted gross income (AGI) limitation.
Last paragraph on page one




individual, losses of personal-use property from 
fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or theft 
are deductible only if the loss is attributable to a 
federally declared disaster (federal casualty 
loss). See Pub. 547 for more information.
But I could be wrong, only prepared about 400 returns so far this year.
Also, if you find a way to get around it for your $8200 loss let me know. I have a client who lost farm, house, livestock and equipment in excess of $200K in a fire that was part of a disaster area but  they lived 20 miles from the county that was declared in so they weren't able to claim it. But the IRS may help you out.
@_date: 2019-04-27 03:22:38
TCJA went into effect this year and with it casualty losses are no longer deductible unless you are in a federally declared disaster area and your loss is in relation to the disaster.
@_date: 2019-04-27 18:43:56
There is no technically correct way for you to report the loss. Even if you were able to take the theft loss it probably wouldn't do you any good anyways. It counts towards your itemized deductions and unless you have in excess of $12,000($24,000 MFJ) in itemized deductions you'll take the standard regardless. 
In regards to the loss, it's subject to a 10% of AGI floor plus $100. 
Ex. Your AGI is $50,000. $50,000*10%=$5,000+$100=$5,100 
So, only $3,100 of the loss would count towards your itemized deductions.
This is in no way to be considered as tax advice to you as I wouldn't advise any of my clients to do this. Also, I don't know when you bought into BTC but, the sketchiest way to report it and probably have it fly is to report it as a sale on the date of the the lowest price for the year.
@_date: 2019-04-27 22:36:09
You're right. I got frustrated when I answered their question and they linked the instructions to the form like it confirmed exactly what they were saying. It really sucks that he took a loss on it. I just deal with it on a daily basis and everyone thinks their situation is special so maybe I'm a little bit jaded. When everyone is special, no-one is. Don't get me wrong, we do everything we can to help our clients but, the code is what it is.

I'm a tax accountant and about to sit for the CPA exam. I would likely declare the winnings and call that the basis in your btc.
@_date: 2019-09-23 23:55:28
The problem is not accepting bitcoin at a dispensary, it comes in when you need to convert back to fiat to pay wages, utilities, suppliers etc. When converting back to fiat it has to go through a financial institution (I know there are other ways around it but we are talking about day to day transactions that are conducive to business) and the character of the money has not changed . It's still drug money according to FCPA and therefore cannot be ran through a federally insured institution. Even sales tax (in my State at least) has to be hand delivered in cash monthly. The big question is when the money is re-characterized and is no longer "drug money". This of course is in the US.

The cap on any individual year is $3000. The remaining losses are carried forward and deductible up to 3K per year until exhausted.
