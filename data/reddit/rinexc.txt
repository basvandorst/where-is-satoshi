Oh, sure. I know it's not hard evidence, but I thought they had planned for it since they explicitly state different power measures:


Extras? I've even seen them being included in early system specifications more times than not. We used to say that in large scale production "yield is king". Also, I didn't expect bitmain to feel time or cost pressured, but I don't know their past history.

Indeed. Since each mining ASIC is composed of many cores, the overall process yield should be relatively high, even for risk productions.


Usually you take measures planning for this outcome, like some autotesting and clock gating. You get half the hashing power, though =)

Why not? I always thought they would be perfect candidates for risky runs. Even single digits yields could be enough.

TSMC [10nm process](


And they do have a 7nm process as well, with low yield though...
I wondered what Bitmain had been doing with their design team these past months. Now that they are shipping asic miners for monero and ethereum, I guess they might be designing a new sha256d miner. Do we have any info if any of these new chips are 10nm already?

Yeah, it makes sense. Sha256d seems a better choice in venturing in a lower yield process, because of the larger number of cores. Anyway, TSMC's 7nm seems to be in the double digits already, so I guess the overall yield for a sha256d miner should be rather acceptable already. This design will be expensive, though...
