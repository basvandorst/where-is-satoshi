So, don't you think Gold is going to grow in price more than Bitcoin? I mean Gold is more stable but Bitcoin is able to grow faster

Well, yeah, a little bit confusing sign but still nice to see BIG logo of bitcoin! Usually there is small sigh of Bitcoin acception

There are too many idiots out there who are unable to manage "legal tender"...I wouldn't trust them with virtual currency.

No, it's a real crappy city down south. I've heard it's the meth capital of the east coast. I don't know how true that is.
