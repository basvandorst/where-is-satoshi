Good that you say this, thank you. I was worried that maybe everyone was not able to access their money! I'll continue waiting for a week more or so. Then maybe I'll try get a lawyer to contact their legal dept.

Back when I registered the account approval was done right up, so I was under the impression that things would always be smooth. So maybe there are many other people like you and I waiting for ages? You're lucky that there none of your money stuck on their site.
 I'm not sure what to do now. I feel like all their high fees that I paid were for nothing, since now I have to go through this hassle. I should have just stuck to advice people had given me to use Kraken. I didn't listen because the whole process seemed more adapted to beginners on the Cex exchange.

Exactly, there was no reason given. I wasn't sure what to think. 


Thank you. I was not aware that everywhere is overloaded. It's probably only normal with all the hype about bitcoin recently. 


Yes I see some of what you mention on the bitcontalk forum

Excellent, I appreciate the advice. I'm looking into this right now.

I'm trying wire with USD. After researching some pages, I'm reading on bitcointalk that it can take [nearly a month]( to get through! At least that's slightly reassuring that the money eventually gets through. 
Would it be faster to withdraw through my credit card? What are the fees on say 10k usd via card withdraw? On wire withdraw it's 50usd!
Does anyone know of a faster exchange for withdrawing via wire? I won't be using Cex again.

Ok thank you for reassuring me, it must just be their slow support response times that is make me freak out. Still, 3 weeks waiting for a wire transfer it very long IMO.

I pronounce it "sex" - it's a good game on word sounds!
