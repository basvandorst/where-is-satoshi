This really needs more up votes. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 05:51:15
A for effort but no way. Break the hive mind mentality please. There is no we. I'd donate to something to a cause like this though. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:46:57
Not until it is released and listed on a exchange, if it is at all. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:00:53
You will need to load wallet.dat in the core client. It doesn't need to sync. Go to the console and type dumpprivkey followed by the address. Then you can take the private key and sweep it using whatever program your comfortable with.  I sometimes use counterwallet.io to sweep cold storage keys. Good luck. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:33:31
Submit the code and convince almost everyone that has a stake in Bitcoin that it is a good idea. Which besides the block size it's not imo. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:25:48
I know in the US you need a good amount of lube. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 02:13:37
Doge for the win.   
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:18:42
It wouldn't be Bitcoin anymore. Why not just use an altcoin ? They are not going away anytime soon. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:32:01
Its good to see someone taking a stand. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:10:08
Oh ok so If you want to spend money you need a microchip in your hand.  Man I hope for faster bitcoin adoption. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 23:42:16
Looks great. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:09:38
A bit to much for my stomach to handle. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:22:03
I completely agree. I often forget sarcasm doesn't work to we'll on the internet. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:52:23
Its open source. If you want some new feature build it yourself or hire people to do it for you.  The real challenge imo is the battle between statists and people who want to be left alone.
@_date: 2015-06-23 04:03:33
I disagree there. I think the altcoin party is just beginning. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 04:05:26
I agree. Some people just can't see the potential. Were still very early and ahead of the curve imo. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:29:13
Hard to say. Looks promising and interesting. I bought some too but it was with money I was willing to loose speculating with.  
@_date: 2015-06-16 06:01:47
I buy all 3 every payday atm. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 07:17:07
Um no. I'm done contributing to criminals. Throw me in a cage, kill me, down vote, do whatever you stupid statists need to do to feel all self-righteous, but I'm done with it.
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:27:57
Will US citizens be allowed to use this?
@_date: 2015-06-28 05:44:43
Yes, your masters want their cut to expand their global system of death and destruction so make sure you pay up or you will be thrown in a cage or killed.  I'll never sell to USD for these reasons. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 21:49:18
That is exactly what I ment to type.  Thanks.  
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:43:40
Well here is my try.   
Please check out my news site also. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:55:13
On no here come the Aml compliance nazis.  Looks cool but Aml is a sick system built to control finance not liberate it. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:14:23
Inspiring. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:44:51
Remember how Bitcoin started off on day one operating on a global scale? Yeah neither do I. Some people just don't see that Bitcoin will not be the only one. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 05:46:43
That game is frustratingly fun. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:21:23
This project looks very interesting. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 05:58:56
No doubt. It's going to be so interesting to see how it all plays out. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:35:47
Lame. Alt coins work perfectly fine. Some are scams but so what do your homework.  Last I checked I can spend a large variety of alt coins quite easily.  The altcoin market will not die get over our precious Bitcoin not being the only one. It's just a matter of time for one to grow into something larger and better. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:13:52
I partially agree. Sure some are scams but look at one of the many stock exchanges around the world.  The New York Stock Exchange has 1800+ listings. Most are garbage with little or no earnings. Scams. copies of how other stocks operate. This one market has a market cap of over 16 trillion dollars.  We will see something similar to this with alt coins or 2.0 assets imo.   
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:39:07
Your a little braver than me. Id just use an exchange. Or find a bitcoin atm. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:22:13
Price will ultimately show if it matters or not. Bitcoin needs to be abused to show it's resilience imo.
@_date: 2015-06-18 21:46:17
Ha, this was funny.  It would be interesting to see how markets react if Satoshi release his idea of what should be done. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:24:06
This story made me sick to my stomach. What crooks. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:13:10
Thank's for the feedback. It was not intentional. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 02:49:54
No one really knows what Bitcoin will be best used for yet. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 02:51:13
This is old af!
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:49:37
Yeah what other said COUNTERPARTY!!! It's a awesome project.
@_date: 2016-06-20 04:08:45
Best BTC show ever imo. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 02:46:30
I don't think so. Not that I've seen. Also most altcoin exchanges don't know anything except for a user name and ip number. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 02:46:43
It's fun and risky. l like trading. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:58:49
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:24:05
Try virwox.com. Big spread but you can withdraw to paypal
@_date: 2015-08-09 00:29:35
Yeah, It's worth it to give bullies your lunch money so they stop picking on you.  For today anyways.
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:43:05
Lol oops. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:27:02
I have a list on my site. Imo coinigy is the best but costly.  
@_date: 2015-07-03 17:03:38
This was a really good and though provoking episode. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:51:47
@_date: 2015-08-09 01:27:37
Dollar cost average is my best friend.
@_date: 2015-07-17 03:44:26
I like your thinking. I wonder how many transactions per second all 3 would amount to. I think there are quite a few more decent coins that could be added to the group.
@_date: 2015-07-29 06:20:48
Try coinigy.com they have some good charts. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:31:01
Only time will tell, but I think your wrong. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:53:57
I'm old school I guess. I still use the full core client on a encrypted usb stick. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:52:14
Me too. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:20:10
I loved it, very powerful and inspiring trailer.
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:55:04
Good song!
@_date: 2015-07-12 03:32:17
I see gold silver guns and land as just another portfolio position like Bitcoin and other cryptos. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:13:01
Stefan is awesome imo. Love his vids.
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:41:56
Yeah, I have also had problems with this service. I was hopeful that it was legit, but my overall experience was dissatisfying.  
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:51:09
Dogecoin is a serious cryptocurrency pretending to be a joke.
@_date: 2015-07-17 03:35:28
Wow thanks for the detailed info.
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:16:52
I like his videos. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 06:54:50
They don't quite understand it but my daughter loves Dogecoin Dog.
@_date: 2015-04-17 17:37:53
Imo I think you should try. You won't make much but you can get a antminer for $100 on ebay.  At current rates it will make about $30 per month depending on difficulty.    Here is a good calculator to estimate mining profitability. You'll get more btc if you just buy but mining is interesting too.  Good luck.  Check out my bitcoin wallet tutorial sometime. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 01:05:25
Diversity is the best bet imo. I have a nice portfolio of btc, ltc, doge, and about 8 others.  Im really loading the boat on counterparty. Good luck though. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:34:39
Bitcoin is doomed now lol. Let me guess it was created by a 3 year old prodigy. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 06:12:01
So convincing. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:53:08
I like circle much better than coinbase. Circle was fast and easy.  Debit to my cold storage in about a min once im set up. I only buy a little every week so It works perfect.
@_date: 2015-04-06 22:18:57
Try root or admin as user
Try root or password for password. 
Hope it helps
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:10:37
Your correct, that would be a more advanced and secure way. My goal is to mainly help noobs, and a lot of noobs use win7. Thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2015-04-04 06:52:59
With bitcoin you don't need permission to send money. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 14:43:50
Advice or lubrication? 
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:54:02
There are many ways to go about this and my method not be the best but I'd recommend you generate some addresses on a offline computer and use those. Or if your really paranoid learn multisig.  If your using windows try my full client wallet tutorial so you can keep the bitcoin wallet on a encrypted usb drive. Thats what I do anyways. Good luck.   
@_date: 2015-04-04 05:00:40
Learn to make a game like 
Then not only will you have your homework done but you can also make some btc. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:12:07
I like circle better than coinbase. I buy a small amount every payday. It's fast, to my wallet in under a min once your set up. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:36:34
A system built on theft, violence and intimidation can NEVER be virtuous, so I don't vote. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:23:34
I try to influence it by promoting cryptocurrencies a solution. Voting is useless in its current form in my opinion. Thanks for the input though these conversations are always interesting.   
@_date: 2015-04-02 05:49:46
I'm very curious to see how it develops also. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 23:16:37
Yeah I don't see what the problem is either.
@_date: 2015-04-03 15:42:00
Monthly and weekly pivots are gold. Yearly pivots also. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 03:30:22
Yeah sounds like a fun game. You could cut up and hide the key, but what if the server shuts down? Always keep backups. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 20:46:44
I think the altcoin market is far from dead. Sure some coins are doomed and scams but as a whole I think the altcoin market is just getting started.  Compare it to one of the many stock exchanges around the world that list garbage stocks with no earnings that have multi million dollar valuations. Only time will tell I guess.    
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:44:22
Are you saying the only way to pay for these things is by violence and coercion?  Or are you saying that without violence and coercion we would not have roads, police and healthcare?
@_date: 2015-04-15 14:58:08
Well put. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:44:15
You have to provide the mining pool a address to send btc.  You only connect the miner to the wallet if you are solo mining. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:56:52
Give my hot wallet tutorial a try. Hope it helps. 
 
@_date: 2015-04-14 05:04:40
Please convince me that the US dollar is not going to collapse. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:32:36
No solo mining is when you mine all alone. You point your miner to your local wallet and you might find a block one day. If you mine at a pool you get smaller payouts.
@_date: 2015-03-31 02:37:13
So true.
@_date: 2015-03-31 22:57:03
This is getting interesting. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:56:28
Yeah, they went downhill fast. I ended up getting a refund last May for the Neptune I ordered. Glad I did too, because I haven't heard anything positive about the company since. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:22:22
What is it's use compared to the energy used by the things bitcoin can replace, such as Visa's servers ect.  I like pos coins too. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:35:04
I've been slowly working on something like this for my site. It's for alt coin's too. This will probably will get the down vote's to oblivion but check it out.
  
@_date: 2016-05-03 06:08:24
Maybe Charlie is Satoshi!!!! 
@_date: 2015-03-31 01:42:52
That's so nuts to remember those days. I remember not buying enough and loosing some to crashed hdd's. Oh well.
