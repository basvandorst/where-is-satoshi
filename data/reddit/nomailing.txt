Consensus should be pre fork to avoid confusion of exchanges and merchants and users. They have to know for sure in which blockchain they should post and receive transactions. 
The thing is that XT for example has a build in mechanism to make sure that BIP-101 only activates if there is consensus between miners. In contrast, Theymos is talking about consensus between developers. The problem with this policy is that a few developers can dictate what is allowed to discuss. That is really harmful for Bitcoin. It is completely unclear who counts as a developer and the decision to count only "core" developers is completely arbitrary. Bitcoin core is just one client and there are many alternatives. It is arbitrary if only developers of one client implementation have the right to veto any change.

I assume they have no idea how to do that. I have the impression,  that many people in this subredit blindly assume authorities are investigating this. From my experience of the btc24 fiasco a year ago I would assume that nobody of the authorities knows how to deal with it and they also don't want to. 
the only way to change that is if the victims combine their efforts and build up pressure. instead of waiting we should all be calling the police in japan the court and Karpeles himself. Without that nobody is investigating anything.

Germany is not a socialist country. It has a "social market economy". This is completely different. An excerpt from wikipedia:
Social market economies aim to combine free initiative and social progress on the basis of a competitive economy.[8] The social market economy is opposed to socialism and laissez-faire policies[9] and combines private enterprise with regulation and state intervention to establish fair competition, maintaining a balance between a high rate of economic growth, low inflation, low levels of unemployment, good working conditions, social welfare, and public services.

It would be very easy for Mark to prove this by just posting the bitcoin addresses. The fact that Mark is not posting anything but obfuscating by blaming malleability is reason enough to assume that he actually stole the Bitcoins.

I completely agree with all your points.
Recently I heard a lot about the need for political unity in Europe. Personally, I see the main problem in the media. There is just no European press. I tried to get informed about the European election solely on a European level and not get biased towards a single member nation. It is almost impossible to get informed neutrally about European politics on a European level. In all media there is a national tone and talking about "our money and their money" and "our interests and their interests". I tried watching Euronews but unfortunately there is not much debate going on there. 
If you try google news, there is not even a European news category, so I ended up choosing the US-news-category to get a neutral position on European politics, but even then I ended up receiving 70% of articles concerning UK internal affairs. Why is there no EU news category?
I also use the android app "news republic" where there even was a "European election" category. But even in this category all articles were written from the view of specific member states. 
Maybe the different languages make a European wide debate very difficulty. But I think it was slightly better this election because of the common candidates for the president of the commission.

You would see a 750'000 BTC transaction volume on a single day somewhere, because no hacker would leave 750'000 BTC in the old addresses which are still controlled by Mark.
So either way, there are only two options how it could be that an outside hacker stole the Bitcoins:
1) The 750'000 BTC were drained through transaction malleability. Then we could easily see these transactions in the blockchain. But there are none!
2) The 750'000 BTC were stolen by a hacker who got access to the cold storage keys. Then we would see large transaction volume during one day. But there is none!
3) Mark is lying and has all the BTC.

1. Probably the accounts are not coupled to real bitcoin addresses, but more like an account at an exchange.
2. You seem to confuse several ways how you could use SMS authentication.
3. No, this seems to be not true. As you can see in the demo, you have to verify by replying with a unique key per transaction. They send you this key before they execute. This is roughly the same mechanism which my bank also uses when I initiate a wire transfer. So the authentication is not by "the number of the originating SMS" as you said, but the authentication is by "the number to which they send the unique key". This is a huge difference.

I hope that this will actually show people that the proof-of-work mining is doomed to fail at some point if we do not change the protocol. Maybe this will get more people to realize that we already have a technical solution which could easily be implemented: Just use proof-of-stake mining for every second block. You can use the hash of previous proof-of-work-blocks to pseudo randomly generate an ordered list of all existing bitcoin addresses and use this to determine who can submit the next block. This would be as efficient as proof-of-work and does not even require any complex signing of blocks or whatever. So the bottom line is: The technical solution is here, we just need the economic majority to do the protocol change and force it although many miners would try to hinder this.

Maybe you don't need 100% reliability and you are ok with 99%.
If you would use it only as a backup and anyway keep the data locally. Or if you just want to use it to synchronize your files with all your devices. For me it would be sufficient. For a backup and/or sync service I would be ok with something like a probability that the cloud looses my data once every week or so, because I anyway keep a local copy. But actually in reality the system probably has a much lower failure rate.

I think this is a good solution. It completely removes the financial incentive for someone to store only one copy of the data while pretending it is stored on many PC's.
For me it looks like chuckup made many comments here where he argues that "There is a financial incentive to lie". But with this method there is no financial incentive. Therefore it is very unlikely that 10 copies of your data would be stored on a single machine. 
So the only remaining argument of chuckup's comment is that it could actually be, although there is no financial incentive. Actually Bitcoin has theoretically the same problem that someone might trick new users to download a wrong blockchain in a sybil attack, right? And in Bitcoin are also ways how you can mitigate that risk...
So I think it is very well doable. And esspecially for practical purposes, it might even be very sufficient to have the backup only on very few PC's because you anyway keep your local copy. At least, I wouldn't care if dropbox goes out of buisness and my data on their server is lost, because I still have my complete backup and could easily switch to another service. Practically it is negligibly unlikely that my local copy get's corrupted exactly at the same time as the online copy is getting unavailable.

Of course there is evidence. Otherwise they wouldn't pay a fine.
If the investigators cannot pinpoint these cases to some individuals then they just don't look close enough. Probably because these bankers are very rich and influential businessmen.
The investigators have evidence for the case. Then there must be some individual to whom this evidence points to. Some documents with signatures maybe...
HSBC said themselves that they "failed to conduct basic due diligence on some of its account holders".
"Bank officials repeatedly ignored internal warnings that HSBC's monitoring systems were inadequate".
If HSBC cannot name these bank officials, then clearly there must be some CEO going to prison for not reporting the names of these officials...
There are documents. And there are signatures of bank officials on these documents. Do you really belief that this is not evidence enough? How blind sight can the justice system be in that case? 
Don't you think that these bank officials were treated favorably? They obviously knew that they were doing business with money launderers... If there are no prison sentences, do you think that in general in the future banks will be more careful? This is a free ticket to just do it again and again and just be careful that you are not detected, but even in that case the bonus payments of the bankers are already in safe heavens. So why should a bank official care in the future?

That makes a lot of sense!
Hal Finney was diagnosed with ALS in August 2009
The new Bitcoin Forum opens on November 22, 2009
During the next year his condition gets worse. Slowly he begins to realize that he might not be able to hide his identity anymore if he has to go to hospital and at the same time Satoshi Nakamoto will not post in the forums and cannot answer messages. Therefore he plans the controlled disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto, so that it cannot be directly linked to himself.
The first post of Hal Finney was on November 30, 2010
The last post of Satoshi Nakamoto was on December 12, 2010
Given the history of Hal Finney it would be very unlikely that he was not registered on bitcointalk from the beginning. Even more suspicious is that after his registration his account directly starts to post very actively which is very unusual for a new registered user. For example:
6 posts on December 04
3 posts on December 05
5 posts on December 06
When Satoshi decided that his pseudonym should disappear in 2010, then he definitely should have created another account slightly before that disappearance.
And in addition: If Hal Finney is not Satoshi Nakamoto, then it would be so much unlikely that he starts posting on bitcointalk forums exactly when his ALS conditions get so much worse. This wouldn't make sense at all! Only if he was very involved in the creation of Bitcoin from the beginning, it makes sense that he creates an account exactly at that time of his life.

Actually, the more I think about it, I see it as a feature. Due to this the loosing fork has it directly harder to compete and to stay active. Thereby it avoids the problematic scenario of having competing chains active at the same time which would create market uncertainty and problems for exchanges to decide which chain is the true Bitcoin.
So due to this slow difficulty readjustment the miners and all market participants (exchanges, merchants) have a strong incentive to directly switch to the fork with 75% hashing power. This makes sure that the hard fork will be completed during a very short time making it very painless without creating uncertainty by competing chains. 
Personally, I predict that the remaining 25% of miners who would still run the old client will switch to the new protocol within a few hours. So the transition will be painless. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 20:12:14
Obviously Hal Finney was Satoshi. There is so much evidence.
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:13:23
Not true. The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks (not every 2 weeks). So if we assume a fork with a 50-50 split of the hashrate and the fork happens directly at the start or end of the halving it would take 4 weeks until readjustment. 
If the fork happens at the middle of the readjustment interval, it will take 3 weeks for first readjustment, but this first readjustment does not immediately change the difficulty to accommodate all lost hashrate, because it readjusts based on statistics of the full last 2016 blocks. Therefore it would take another 3 weeks until it fully readjusts. So in total in that case around 6 weeks with very low transaction throughput. 
And remember that these estimates are for the case of 50-50 hashrate split. In reality we should more expect something like 75% to 25%, because only then it would trigger the fork. That means you will have to wait for around 8 weeks for readjustment and during that time the remaining 25% will probably have already switched. So, better if you don't count on the readjustment. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:04:15

At thr moment it looks like they have the power to do exactly that. They are the only ones who decide what pull request gets accepted. Their side is even still actively censoring the debate. It doesn't look good for Bitcoin. Over the years I always advocated for Bitcoin, but now I am advising everyone of my personal friends qnd family to sell. If the politics of Core doesn't change and the majority of the community is not even considering a change to another client, then Bitcoin is doomed.
RBF is clearly a controversial change. Nonetheless the community is not switching to alternative clients. Please people, if you want small blocks, still just switch to Bitcoin Unlimited and set the block limit to 1 MB. That would still be better then running this crappy Dictator Core Censorship Client. Or please just switch off your Core node. We once thought more nodes means more decentralization, but actually we have a more decentralized system,  the less Core nodes there are. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:37:47
The problem is, that we have now only 4 core developers who have everything in their control. They don't let anyone else into the core development team. They have entitled themselves to have the right to make all decisions. This decision making process is so broken. Unfortunately, these 4 developers do not even see that, because they think they are the Bitcoin gods. The decision making process in Bitcoin core is so top-down driven that it is totally centralized. 
The worst part is that the majority of people think that that is ok. I feel like the Bitcoin community was brainwashed by a dictatorship. I fully understand Mike Hearn's decision. Hopefully, the Bitcoin community can leave the core client behind and shifts the power to another development team which is willing to make decisions at least somewhat democratic. And I mean this independent from the blocksize issue.

Isn't the idea to make it symmetric for increase and decrease?
So for an increase at least 80% have to agree. And similary for a decrease at least 80% must be voting for a decrease. If neither the increase nor the decrease side has 80% the blocksize limit stays untouched.
For example, if the current blocksize limit is 2MB and 30% vote for 4 MB and 70% vote for 1MB, then the limit will stay at 2MB.
Also the rate of decrease would be symmetric, because in the case of a decrease the algorithm does not choose the minimum but the 20th percentile counted from the side which is closer to the status quo. For example, current limit is 2MB and 19% vote for 10MB, 2% vote for 1.9MB and 79% vote for 1MB. Then the new limit would be set to 1.9MB, although most miners (70%) would like to decrease it to 1MB.
I hope this is what the BIP suggests, but obviously the wording in the BIP is very vague and nobody really knows what is meant... Definitely some clarification is needed.

So the EU bails out greeks, so that greeks can repay the banks, because the banks had lend money to Greece, which the greeks used to have a nice living (pensions etc)...

Big shifts in mining pools are exactly one indication of the fact that mining power is not very distributed across many people but that only a few individuals control most of the market and are able to shift their power. 
If it would be very distributed, one would expect much more constant pool stats. If I have a mining farm controlling 10% of total mining power I can easily switch from one pool to another leading to changes that we sometimes see. If individual entities would control less then for example 1% of mining power, then you would expect to see much smaller changes in stats. 
If you compare that to the distribution of BTC, you see that much more people hold BTC than there are people who mine. Now you might think that this distribution of coins is very sparse, and indeed there are a few individuals with many coins and many individuals with only a few coins. But still the distribution should be much more distributed in comparison to the high centralization of mining, because the current distribution of mining is just an instantaneous snapshot of ownership of highly specialized hardware which is more efficient to operate in masses, while the distribution of coins has evolved over time during which old time holders have sold to new comers, who later again sold to new comers always smoothing out the distribution... 
There are many people who mined in the old days when mining was still more decentralized using their CPUs. Many of them still hold BTC but are not mining anymore, since ASICs came along. So over time the ownership of mining power has changed leading to a more distributed ownership of coins in comparison to just the ownership of the current generation of efficient ASICs.

I would say, mining is much worse, if you want the decision to be more uniformly spread across more people.
Bitcoin mining power is much more centralized than Bitcoin-Stake.

I am not saying that the issue is that there are no alternatives. We have btcd and it works quite well. I would even say it is much better in comparison to core because the code is better structured. The real issue is that many people have the false impression that they are only really running the real Bitcoin protocol if they are running bitcoin core. If there is a bug in bitcoin core which is not in btcd and would cause a fork everyone would say bitcoin core is nonetheless the correct fork.
That line of thinking is not really progressive and is even hindering progress to fix bugs. 
Would you say that you are surfing the real Internet only if you are browsing with Internet Explorer because it has the word Internet in the name? Internet Explorer did not comply with many Web standards just because it was the most used browser and thereby it could always claim that it is "THE Web standard". This led to much wasted development time of Web developers because they had to make sure that Web pages comply with the real Web standard AND with the "Internet Explorer Web standard" which contained a lot of bugs which were never fixed. 
I think Bitcoin development could progress much faster and more importantly much safer if the protocol specification is separated from specific client implementations. If there is just one reference implementation there is an increased likelihood of very dangerous bugs that could effect the whole system and bring it down. Another example is the OpenSSL library which was used everywhere so that a bug like heartbleed directly effects the whole Internet infrastructure. Just think about the consequences of a similar bug in Bitcoin. There is a real danger of centralized client development that many people just don't realize. I think that bitcoin would be much more resilient if 33% would use core and 33% would use btcd and another 33% would use bitcoinXT. Similarly, how it is helpful for the Web to have the userbase distributed across Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. This leads to competition so that every implementation tries to incorporate more features. For example, if that would be the case with bitcoin clients we would already have many full clients which have mixers build in.

While I must say that the paper is well written and highlights important aspects, I think the conclusion is wrong. You say: "We showed that by depending only on resources within the system, proof of stake cannot be used to form a **distributed consensus**, since it depends on the very history it is trying to form to enforce loss of value."
This conclusion relies very much on a wrong interpretation of **distributed consensus**, which was earlier defined in the paper as: 
"A distributed consensus, as the term is used in Bitcoin, is a consensus (i.e. global agreement) between many mutually-distrusting parties who lack identities and were not necessarily present at the time of system set up."
This definition is unclear and leaves too much room for different interpretations. New Bitcoin users have to trust their downloaded Bitcoin-Software to have the correct genesis block message and the correct checkpoints.
Therefore you must agree that the bootstrapping of new clients in Bitcoin anyway involves a certain trust and is not completely in accordance with your definition ("**mutually-distrusting parties**"). Therefore if you want to define **distributed consensus**, as the term is used in Bitcoin, you must exclude the bootstrapping of new clients anyway.
The definition of **distributed consensus** in Bitcoin just means that peers who have been once in agreement with the other distrusting parties will stay in agreement. Therefore depending on your interpretation of your definition either both or neither of PoW and PoS have distributed consensus.

I have some important feature requests and bug reports for your Android app which would make it actually usable in my real life:
1) In the Advanced Send section the address dropdown lists use black text on black background. Please change that so that it is readable!
2) In the Advanced Send section please autofill textboxes on the right of the input addresses with the amount available in that input address. Or even better, please just remove these textboxes for the input addresses alltogether and just always use the full available amounts in that address by default.
3) In the Advanced Send section it is not possible to send because the app always complains that "The sum of the amounts for all sending addresses must be equal to the amount specified on top of the screen". This error message does not make sense. I am not able to send anything and tried different combinations of values all giving the same error message. Either there are some rounding errors with values or something else is totally broken in your advanced send. Maybe you are not accounting for the network fee? I specified the following:
* destination address
* amount on top of screen: 0.0816 (I assume this is what should arrive at the specified destination address. also tired 0.0817)
* one input address: 0.0817
* network fee: 0.0001
* new change address
Please increase the overall usability of the advanced send.

I first heard about Bitcoin from a computer science professor in 2011 during lunch with my lab at the university. He said he has some Bitcoins worth 1000 EUR and will hold them. I really felt his facination by the topic so that I looked it up. I bought only very few with 10 EUR by using Second Life Linden Dollars and some weird exchanges. I mined some but don't remember how much and eventually anyway forgot about it and lost the wallet when formatting my PC... Unfortunately I didn't had the motivation to really professionally start mining or investing.
In November-December 2012 I started for the first time in my life buying stocks and keeping an interest in investments. Then I remembered Bitcoins and watched the charts.
Then in the beginning of 2013 I bought BTC for 1000 EUR which was the best decision I ever made. Since then sold some during each bubble, but also lost some when the btc24-exchange and mtGox went offline. Now I am left with around 10 BTC and a profit of around 10000 EUR from which I had to pay 2500 EUR in taxes. Now I am just holding and waiting for the next bubble.

What you say is definitely correct given your interpretation of distributed consensus. With my comment, I just wanted to highlight that your definition and interpretation of distributed consensus is not how it should be ideally defined.
For me distributed consensus means that the system keeps clients in consensus over time if they were in consensus at an earlier time. Therefore I think PoS achieves distributed consensus. If you want to refer to the capability of Bitcoin to bootstrap new clients without Trust, then I think you should name that differently and not "distributed consensus". Maybe something like "trustless bootstrapping". And then one could highlight exactly the theoretical problems of this trustless bootstrapping using either PoW (trust in genesis and checkpoints and seed-nodes) or PoS (additional trust that very old keys were not published and used to create a fork). Surely, in this regard PoS has a drawback in comparison to Bitcoin. But also bitcoin has some problems with "trustless bootstrapping". 
So it is definitely a nice paper, but I think in your definition you should separate these two aspects.

stock exchanges do not have transactions one at a time (only at the highest level). there is a scaling too between you &lt;-&gt; your bank &lt;-&gt; broker &lt;-&gt; high Volume Trade Server. And at each level the party can batch orders together and therefore reducing the load on the highest server.

the "u" is metric.
you write u for the greek letter μ (mu), which means micro, so:
1000 uBTC = 1 mBTC

the bitcoin price is much too high!
2 EUR is much cheaper than 0.02 BTC.
So why even post it in r/bitcoin.
If a company wants to profit from bitcoin, it should at least offer comparable prices and not such scam price.
They should put the bitcoin price to 0.01 BTC because they can safe the paypal costs.

This is false.
If you receive money from a person, you don't know, and their bank account was frozen, then of course they can reverse the transaction.

I am also convinced that this is really a serious problem for bitcoin. 
In addition to your points: If you think about the implications if the bitcoin exchange rate will rise even more in the next few years. A higher exchange rate will produce more and more miners burning more and more energy because the total energy consumption of the network will always balance itself to be roughly equal to the total mining reward which is payed out (which will increase as the bitcoin price increases). So this could eventually lead to a point where the wasted energy for bitcoin is so environmentally damaging that it has to be prohibited by law. 
I really hope that before we reach this point, the core developers of bitcoin will change their mind and realize that we need a hardfork. We need changes to the core bitcoin protocol (the algorithm which determines how mining rewards are distributed!). So far, most bitcoin advocates say that this should be [prohibited under all circumstances]( but this could be fatal for bitcoin in a few years.
I personally think, we really should do a hardfork and introduce proof-of-stake (PoS) mining to solve this problem. The fraction between proof-of-work-mining (PoW) and proof-of-stake-mining (PoS) should be continuously adjusted by proof-of-stake voting. This would make the protocol much more sustainable, because all stake holders of bitcoin will always adjust the reward which is payed out to proof-of-work miners. The bitcoin stakeholders would not vote for too much PoW-reward, because the mining reward is directly proportional to what they would loose in their share. At the same time they would not vote for too less PoW-reward because they want security. So the free market will converge to the exact right amount of energy which is needed for bitcoin to succeed.
Some people would suggest that we could switch to alternative currencies like PPCoin. But we should not rely on switching to alt-coins just because some people are afraid of protocol changes and hardforks. Bitcoin is THE cryptocurrency and as soon as we open the pandora box and allow other cryptocurrencies to be as successful as Bitcoin, then the whole ecosystem loses the trust which it has now, because nobody could be sure that their bitcoins will remain their value. If there are a lot of competing coins, then it will not serve as a good store of value anymore. It would be like fiat currencies where one currency is replaced by a new one if the old one fails. Please, don't let us do the same mistakes. Let us upgrade Bitcoin to a more sustainable protocol!

I think it is not easy for the community to aggree to a new name and really use it. Satoshi is so well known in the community that it is much easier to get people to use it.
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:07:55
I was not talking about the specific software clients, but about the core algorithm that validates the blocks and therefore controls the distribution of the mining rewards. This has to be the same algorithm on all bitcoin clients otherwise it will create a chain fork. So it is not possible for individual miners to change this. 
In the end NOT only the miners have the control to change the bitcoin protocol but the whole ecosystem including merchants. See [Economic_majority]( in the bitcoin wiki.
The problem is that the community has to convince the developers that a hardfork is necessary. The miners have to follow then.
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:20:54
I think the main point is that it is not adjustable at the moment and that is the problem! So if you do arguments and just assume that the bitcoin price stays constant, then your argument is pointless.
In contrast, if you change the algorithm such that it automatically adjusts to a good value, then there is no problem at the moment and never in the future no matter how the price develops.
If you want to make a valid argument, then please at least make the argument independent from the current price or any other eventual price movement in the future. Please just remember, that IT people always made the same mistakes in the history when they underestimated the potential growth in the future (i.e. IP address space, or addressable memory, etc)

I think it is very awkward to tell someone: " Hey, today I bought a pizza for 0.0013 bitcoins".

I think your statement is misleading, because mtgox has a multi-currency matching system. So mtgox is not publishing their total 30 day volume. They are actually reporting many trades twice. For example if their engine is matching a EUR bid with a USD ask, then they will report one trade in the EUR list but also in the USD list.
@_date: 2013-10-04 12:47:17
Very interesting thought. Seems there are just two possibilities:
1) The government will hold on to the bitcoins and thereby they would further support the value of bitcoin by making it more scarce
2) More likely, they will convert it to USD. But this would mean, that the US government will have to create an mtgox account and will take part in the exchange of bitcoins, and thereby indirectly legitimizing the use of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:13:16
of course you can scale it. For example, you could have one server for high volume trades, two for medium volume trades, and 10 for low volume trades. Then the small volume orders are batched together on the low volume servers and sent as one large order to the high volume server. it's just that simple.
And it would make sure, that these trading-bot orders of 0.01 BTC will eventually not make sense anymore, because your order is processed faster if you place one large order directly.
And then there is actually no lag at all, because the system is scalable to infinitum and the high volume server is always responsive.

Did you do the same calculation under the assumption that bitcoin adoption will rise. Just assume for a moment that the bitcoin money supply is equal to the money supply of the world. Do you know how many nuclear reactors would be needed to produce the energy which will be required by the miners?
@_date: 2013-10-15 07:18:21
Actually, there is fidor bank in Germany which happily accepts bitcoin businesses. They even want to allow their customers to trade bitcoins through their interface. And guess what, after they announced it, their stock price jumped up by about 30% or so.
So, maybe, other banks will at some point also just see the profit and jump on the same train.
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:44:28
Or maybe you encode it in the transactions in the "version nr" field.
Then it would be a voting which is not done by the miners, but by the shareholders of bitcoin. Probably the miners would never vote for something which would result in less reward for them. 
The ultimate decision should be made by the users. And the best way to let the users vote is to use proof-of-stake voting, which could be done if everyone puts a flag into the transactions. You could then say that a proposal for a change in the protocol is accepted, when all unspend-outputs from the last year contain more positive than negative votes for the protocol change.
@_date: 2013-08-30 14:36:49
Probably you worked the wrong numbers and didn't realize that mtgox counts a lot of trades double because they have a multi currency trading engine. That means, the currencies on mtgox have one shared order book and some EUR orders are automatically matched to USD orders. 
Therefore in the statistics a lot of trade volume is counted twice if the trade was across two different currencies.
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:06:15
yes, you can. that is called arbitrage!
@_date: 2013-08-31 21:50:59
you can see the long time exponential trend upwards. With some imagination you can see the pretty straight line going up in the logarithmic scale :)
So I think, indeed for bitcoin trading the log scale is very informative about trends. Just compare it with the long term linear trend: there you cannot really see any periodicities or oscillations, because it is shadowed by the exponential trend.
If you think, that this overall trend will continue, then you could use this as a buy/sell trigger. If the price is above the long-term linear (in log scale) trend, then sell. If it is below, then buy. If it is somewhere in the middle, then buy, because the long term overall trend is anyway upwards.
but also from me the disclaimer: don't take financial advice from me or anyone else on this board.

You can have a bitcoin wallet address without any verification. You can just download a wallet (i.e. Multibit) and start it and generate any number of anonymous bitcoin addresses which you could use to receive and send bitcoins.
