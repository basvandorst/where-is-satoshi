Apple Pay is a direct threat to bitcoin. The biggest problem bitcoin has faced is usability for the general public, Apple Pay is now one more thing bitcoin has to fight through to try to become main stream. I personally think this might be the nail in the coffin for bitcoin usability. Credit Cards are almost accepted everywhere and now that both Apple and Google are pushing phones with nfc it will only increase the demand for nfc scanners at terminals. NFC makes payments easier, safer and faster for the consumer, bitcoin can't offer all of that.

"Trust No One" tends to be the phrase that is used when referring to pre encrypted cloud storage. Same concept applies to this.

UDP also runs over IP. Both UDP and TCP are layer 4 while IP is layer 3. So TCP/IP isn't really a transmission protocol more a suite. When comparing the two you should use TCP and UDP since both run over IP. 
Sorry to knit pick but the Network Engineer is having an OCD moment.

You can't tell the file is illegal in the first place because it is completely encrypted. You don't know what data is stored on the hard drives at all. 
Transit and storage networks are protected in the US and there is no signs they won't stop. I can lie to carbonate and give them false information, are they then responsible? Or what about a place like private internet access who accepts bitcoin? Time and time again the courts have protected the transit and storage networks because you can't punish the majority of a society because of a few bad apples. If you want to apply your logic then we should make everything illegal because anything can be used for illegal activity.

That is wrong. What ended up happening is their iphones were set to automatically backup their phones to icloud as almost all iphones do unless unchecked. When their passwords were found either through guessing or phishing or leaked password list, not brute force, the attackers were able to pull down the icloud backups and grab the photos. There is a good chance the celebs weren't even syncing the photos to icloud but what they didn't know was that their phone was backing up to icloud and that said backups included their nude photos. 
Apple reported that almost all the compromised accounts were accessed in less then 5 failed password attempts. In some cases the compromised accounts were logged in on one attempt.

I this situation you are acting as the provider and you don't have the encryption keys. At least in the US you are protected since you have no way of knowing what was uploaded and have no way is decoding it. It's the same reasoning why ISPs aren't liable for transferring the illegal data. You aren't the one committing the crime. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:27:33
Then companies like backblaze and carbonite better just packup and close their doors since they allow pre encryption of data that you upload to their service. They don't hold the keys.
I think you are failing to understand how the encryption technologies work. This type of service would allow you to upload blobs of encrypted data without anyone but yourself knowing what it was. It doesn't index it by name ex "childporn.avi" it only indexes the encrypted blobs. If how your saying it is was the case then most backup companies would have gone out of business a long time ago. But they are protected since they don't have the ability to know what they are storing. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:26:03
Not you. If it's encrypted you have no clue what it is.

I would wait until RedditorRex can update the cert. During this time someone can forge a cert and run a man in the middle attack. If it hasn't already been posted to you should let them know.

Butterfly Labs is only accepting pre-orders via wire transfers and bitcoin and they are closing pre-orders this week. People want to get as many pre-orders as possible and they are paying for it. 
@_date: 2012-07-18 03:54:52
That probably is a small reason why. :P

The doesn't solve the problem it only rotates the problem to another exchange. What would be even better is if the screen rotated the prices to give you options. Or we had a distributed exchange system.

I have a feeling it is still an amazing time to buy into ASICMINER. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:37:03
So you think they should be shipping for units every day? Not that they are failing to deliver their product and are in fact not a scam for that reason?

You paid them for pre orders. The chip wasn't even developed yet when you pre ordered, what did you expect?

Yep, thats why I'm not mad at them while I wait. i waited for the FPGA and I will wait for the ASIC's. There a poorly managed company that makes great products.

You will get a shipping email along with your order being updated on their website from processing to shipped.

How can you say they aren't delivering when there are post every day of people getting their equipment from BFL. A long wait and not delivering are two completely different things.

Hate filled statements like that are where the problem lies. Not the pro life supporters. Do you ever think they may be pro life for a number if reasons that aren't sexist? There are always two sides to any issue. 
Full disclosure I am a pro choice supporter.

Not much these days. CGminer is what most people use and tends to have better support for web gui api's if thats something you're into. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:05:09
Instead of looking at this as an obvious PR move how about we try to get projects funded? We can all just sit here and bitch or we can actually take advantage of free BTC for development purposes to make bitcoin better.

I don't think people overlook as much as weigh the overall politician. I support Ron Paul even though I don't agree with his views on abortion. He brings a lot to the table that I like. No one is ever going to be able to match me perfectly. That's the problem that we face in a representative democracy. Most of the time we have I pick the less of two evils. And when it comes to abortion it's really just a talking point these days. The chance that a politician could actually overturn roe v wade is a lot less of a threat the Palin having launch codes.

Remember that some of us have been mining since 2011 when bitcoins were handed out like candy. Some of us have held on and are set to make more money than we could have ever imagined.

He copied CGminer source code and made changes. It's not really ripping off CGminer since this is all open source and allowed by the license but most people hate Luke JR since he's an asshole so they attack him by using terms like ripping off. Rabble Rabble he rapes babies.

Carbonite will let you encrypt with your own private key. 
Of course this means they can't help you if you lose the private key but the NSA won't be able to read your info. 
Cloudflare also allows for this.

The U.S. Government owns over half the Tor nodes. We're gonna need quite a lot of nodes to do anything.

In fact let's move into a bunker. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:57:41
There isn't rock solid proof but there is quite a lot of talk in the security world about the NSA running as many tor nodes as possible so they can capture traffic.  
  
  
  
  
  
On top of that tor doesn't guarantee your end point will come out of a non U.S. node. Best way to ensure security and anonymity, get an Egyptian VPN to tunnel all of your traffic through. They have zero extradition laws with the U.S. and won't have any soon either.

And they ran into a shitload of issues that come from developing a completely new product. Keep in mind their asic's are next gen compared to what avalon shipped. They are much higher powered and because of that it lead to a bunch more problems. This type of thing happens all the time. Every heard of kickstarter?
