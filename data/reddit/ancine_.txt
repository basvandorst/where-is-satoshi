Why is bitcoin better than real money according to you people? that is my original question and it seems like it is 100% worse unless you want to remain hidden, then it is still worse but you won't be busted.

I don't think it matters unless they get paid in bitcoin.

Why is bitcoin better than real money according to you people? I feel like it is a hassle to use in real life and a hassle to get in the first place. Like what is the advantage to bitcoin for the person using it? It seems like an annoyance to have 2 different currencies when 1 is at a disadvantage - can't be used in real life, the mining aspect of it, need to use a lot of point decimals to buy small stuff which isn't practical.

how do you send bitcoin to them and how the fuck do they use it? I am really confused where you bitcoin is stored and how is it used.


No one actually cares what you do, implying you aren't doing anything bad which is fucking understandable. Are you seriously these regulations are bad?


using 2 currencies is a hassle, especially when 1 is strictly for online spending and when 1 has no security that benefits the user. If you buy something faulty online, you are fucked. If you want to refund, you are fucked.

Can't you do the same already on paypal, honestly? Except the privacy which allows you to charge back and be traced to you in case something happens. No one actually cares what you do, i think it is there just for your protection in case something occurs. It looks like having bitcoin has the disadvantage of no security which makes it useless as an internet currency where you need security. I got hacked several times during the years and i was able to get back where i was due to customer support of paypal.
