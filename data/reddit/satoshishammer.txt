@_date: 2017-02-26 16:31:21
"ChinaBU" thats pathetic. The Chinese government doesnt care about the scaling issue, they care about controlling their citizens ability to move money. The crack down on exchanges is not related to mining, it is a different dynamic when it comes to when and how the gov will treat mining.

Tone, Ive liked alot of your analysis on Bitcoin for a long time, but you got Destroyed. Hes always been appealing to authority, especially to Blockstream coders and their tools. The hosts did a good job calling both sides out
@_date: 2017-02-27 15:33:39
First, Lumping all the miners in China together is completely ignorant of the situation. Second, They've invested millions in these facilities and there supposed to blindly just follow along with what some devs from a private company in USA propose. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 08:35:10

Met a few, they are not nice, Their douchebaggery is the reason the community is in the situation it is in. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 03:49:50
The miners do not trust Bitcoin Core one Bit anymore because the most vocal devs are the ones making these vitriolic claims and treating miners as enemies.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:07:35
The Chinese government doesnt care about the scaling debate. They care about controlling their citizens ability to move money, they understand clearly they cannot control Bitcoin. The recent increase in price despite their hamfisted actions toward the exchanges made that clearer for them.
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:09:39
I think its because of the impression people get of China in most of the world is that its an authoritarian country,which tries to control everything, which to a large extent is true. However, what people outside of China thinks they want to control sometimes greatly differs to what the government in China actually is interested in controlling, mix in some xenophobia + "BU China" and you got your great conspiracy China vs Freedom (USA) click bait recipe
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:11:07
What is the righteous path?
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:58:34
Which miners?
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:28:22
The chain with the most hash power is BTC, stop being delusional.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:12:39
This is one of the real reasons why the community is where its at, these mostly young, arrogant, pretentious white boys strutting around like they're hot shit and know everything with no consideration for others opinions or positions. The miners have been slavishly following Bitcoin Core devs for years! Instead of working together these jerk offs treat others like they must subordinate always. This is the result.
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:12:12
Yea, who cares about facts when you can throw around misleading phrases like "ChinaBU"?
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:41:52

Thats the answer I was looking for. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:01:10
After looking into it more, he is well known in the Chinese BTC community
@_date: 2017-03-29 03:56:12
This is a big hurdle to progress, the most vocal Core devs are the arrogant vitriolic ones. Who would want to work with people who constantly vilify the contribution you make towards the security of Bitcoin? The more reasonable need to step up and a more inclusiveness environment in protocol development needs to be fostered for cross-cultural communication. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:08:46

There was no notification from the exchanges that people funds would be locked up.

Are you well? 
"I also hear people claim to have reversed engineer the chip. Not the device to look for the hidden laptop but the chip. This claim is not one that anyone should take likely its near impossible to reverse engineer any 16nm ASIC chip without a huge lab. In one of those chip there are billions of transistors 16nm in size. The microscope needed to even see they exist isn’t exactly bought at Walmart. Without having access to the code of the chip it would be futile."

Wheres the proof?
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:36:36
Your should make a hat out of that 
@_date: 2017-04-05 07:55:39
No thank a miner? Hmm, cause you know, they are the ones who have the highest monetary risk in Bitcoin and are one of Bitcoins strongest believers. Not to mention that mining secures the network and confirms transactions and have been doing so at large scale for several years now. Sure it may be just a slight lapse, but its probably a sign that too many in this community see miners as "others" that are easily disregarded and seen as not really part of the community. Perhaps this is more of a phenomenon in the English speaking forums.
@_date: 2017-04-05 15:17:13
Yes they do. This argument from the stand point that it costs a huge amount of money to develop a miner, produce it, set up mining facilities and run the business. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 08:30:48
Right, miners are gonna spend millions to develop mining facilities and they dont like Bitcoin. "They dump Bitcoin..." your speculation of what they do with their funds, while lumping all miners together as one.
