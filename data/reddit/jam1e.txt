Today I learned beers in Ireland are too expensive.

Down with this sort of thing!

Filled this in around 12 hours ago, is there a back log? 
@_date: 2014-05-13 22:15:19
That's what I've been told anyway 
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:51:40
Wtf? Never saw this change tip before. Taco poooower! 
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:28:41
Plot twist: OP has shares in beer companies. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 19:08:16
Just spat out my coffee! Ewww 
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:56:22
Don't forget this is US only. Over here in Europe we'd like to have the same opportunity to spend bitcoins! 
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:03:46
Surely I'm too late? Either way, good work. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 19:07:12
A full dinner? Hmm. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:27:40
Are you Irish? That's a decent amount of beer for on here! (yes I'm Irish so it's okay to say that) 
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:08:39
Don't we need a bitcoin yo-yo? 
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:45:24
That's a nice idea actually. How do you go about being the middle man just out of interest? 
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:19:52
Same with bitcoin tips, why would anyone use it? 
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:53:32
Don't feed the trolls. Makes life that little bit easier. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:50:07
Oops, meant 21 hours in the title. But you get the idea! 
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:04:00
Maybe someone should email them and tell them to get one of those "Bitcoin accepted" neon signs! 
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:51:45
This...worked? 
@_date: 2014-05-30 17:15:56
That's true. As well as wanting others to experience bitcoin of course. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 21:29:54
Knew you had some Irish in you tipping all those beers! 
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:48:02
Respect for appreciating the work that these guys put in to ChangeTip. And thanks for making bitcointip in the first place. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:21:42

@_date: 2014-01-10 22:37:00

@_date: 2014-05-16 20:22:30
Might as well take a gamble while you can!

@_date: 2014-05-30 14:06:52
Magic! 
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:44:48
No more tipping the lowest amount when there's multiple options then I take it. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 17:16:31
Cool, joined using reddit account but wonder if it only works with Facebook accounts. Can't even see my balance from the mobile site

@_date: 2014-01-10 22:21:57
Oh lord. I've tried to stay away from dogecoin in case I get addicted to it but you've just given me a free hit! 
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:50:57
Good idea to start getting people to use bits. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:10:49
If (tommy == true) {
      That's pretty cool Tommy. I'm pretty sure you're friends with Deadmau5 (great remix on his album by the way) - do you know if Joel is thinking of accepting bitcoins for his music?
} else {

I'll take a whiskey though, if it's on the house of course!
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:45:15
Why need a tip potato command for tipping small amounts. Who's with me? 
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:11:01
Holy shit. Who needs gold, silver or myrrh when you have bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:36:34
I so want one of these, keep meaning to get one.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:56:30
Hahaha. You're the first person I've saw roll a 6.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:46:22
Relevant name is relevant.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:28:42
Thanks a lot, looks like I've started my journey to owning some bitcoins :)
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:39:02
The gift that just keeps giving though. Could imagine getting weird looks off some people though. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:58:47
At least someone got lucky! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:25:09
But everyone knows it's value is more than the dollar, right? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:50:17
There's such thing as too much money O.o
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:00:48
No problem. Hopefully some people watched it from seeing this post. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 21:18:12
The right one is better imo. The one on the left looks much cheaper looking to me.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:35:56
You're making me want a beer, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:05:01
Okay then. I posted it as a new thread too which should definitely work. Should be able to find it by going to my profile. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:54:00
Why not use bitcoin 24 or something so you don't have to wait around for ages?
Bought some BTC there recently and it was even a good bit cheaper than Mt Gox
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:50:44
Nominet is the organisation that controls the UK domain market. They sell co.uk domains and so on. This is kind of big news actually. 
But the question is how did the invest in this "project". Did they buy lots of bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:29:51
What goes around comes around. It's definitely true. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:50:48
WHAT? 
Awesome. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:03:47
Trying to find someone close enough on localbitcoins really. Don't want to deal with banks etc. to send money to exchanges. Have been keeping my eye on r/bitcoin for a week or two now and really want to get in on it.
@_date: 2013-06-21 18:49:26
There was a TV show in the UK caller "The bank of Dave" that was about a man who wanted to set up his own bank. Let's just say that it wasn't as easy as he expected but I think he has got a bank set up now. You might be able to find it online.
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:41:05
As in interest. The more searches something gets on Google usually means more interest?
Obviously Bitcoin isn't anywhere as well known as gold at the moment, but who knows, maybe one day it will be?
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:12:42
Well done. Still cheaper than some of their competitors software anyway!. 
*Looks at Microsoft* O_o
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:56:42
Could be worth checking Gyft maybe? Heard good things about it although I'm not 100% sure if they do gas cards, I'll try to find out.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:42:48
Thank you! Unfortunately the bot seems to not like me lately though :(
@_date: 2013-07-20 20:41:53
I still remember the day when went crazy giving out tips - was amazing!
@_date: 2013-07-16 00:25:43
Seems quite cheap to me, but then again I suppose it depends on what your site is like and whether people on this subreddit would get use of the site. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:00:34
Epic idea. Who doesn't need a bitcoin? :D
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:55:54
Inspiring stuff, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:23:26
Sounds awesome. I'll be sending the money to them in a few hours so hopefully mine will be quick like yours!
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:05:18
Ah okay thanks a lot Jim. Just noticed around 4 or 5 of the .wallets with numbers after it and was wondering what was going on lol.
Thanks for the help
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:34:11
Sorry about that, just wanted to send it all at once so I don't have to pay miner fees. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:13:00
Any time I see someone tipping it just reminds me how bitcoin is so cool :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:01:19
Wow thanks. Only in this subreddit could you get tipped for making a silly mistake. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:03:42
Isn't there a site called bitbargain that's supposed to be good?
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:46:30
This time it worked. Thank you :) 
@_date: 2013-06-02 09:04:06
A beer here in Ireland costs much more (around €4 to €5) which would be around $7 probably.
Imagine getting tipped $7 for a beer...hmmm
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:42:44
Is this still going? And is it possible even if I only have 0.01 bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:30:23
Think I'm going to use this, cheers. Will deposit money tomorrow and hopefully be able to buy before the weekend 
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:17:48
Haha. Nice one. Maybe I'll have to start visiting r/trees!
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:14:31
Really? I know what you mean and it is hard to imagine, but it was probably just as hard to imaging that we'd be at nearly $400 a coin just a few years ago. 
Put it this way, if I owned anything near 70 btc I'd be a very happy man.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:28:29
As someone living in Ireland, totally agree.
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:01:50
Wonder how much they want for it, hmm. Tempted a little bit. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:24:25
It was some guy called bitcoinbillionaire or something similar. He went around tipping loads of people $1000s each etc. 
That was a crazy time in this subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-08-02 06:29:31
Dude, you're awesome. Just woke up and this made me smile, nothing better than a random act of kindness.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:28:30

It's how a lot of people start out including myself. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:52:33
I'd be up for that. Might be hard to organise though. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:45:28
Love seeing tips in GBP. 
@_date: 2013-09-01 17:49:52
And guess when I bought in? During those two weeks in April! 
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:11:00
Nearly sure there's coffee too. Wonder if there's a Starbucks coffee haha. 
Edit - in Ireland a beer is around $7 in most places, strange isn't it? 
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:57:02
Haha... Edited. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:38:50
You'd think Mt Gox would start investing some of the money that they are making to make it be able to handle lots of traffic etc.
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:59:18
Thanks a lot. Looks like they accept credit cards too? That would be a bonus too actually 
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:34:56
Agree completely. I got interested in bitcoin after someone tipped me something small, now I'm addicted to bitcoin! 
@_date: 2013-08-04 23:01:02
Won't do haha. Hope you have a nice day!
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:42:59
Nice! Is it as simple as updating and nothing else? ie. will my wallet be there straight away etc.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:24:41
That's good to hear, thanks for the reply. 
Agree completely with what you've said. Will think about it a little more. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:34:14
Wow thanks so much. Tipsy already :P
The bot must be drunk too! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:39:59
Did you just....tip....someone.....a....whole....BITCOIN?!
@_date: 2013-06-15 16:54:32
Y U NO USE VERIFY? Haha.
Edit - looks like you've just added it
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:40:44
And we all know how popular cats are on the interwebz!
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:04:45
Is it on any TV station? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:03:21
I'm surprised they haven't done this already actually, usually Google tries to be ahead of the game.
I'll ask a few people that work for Google to see if they can suggest it.
@_date: 2013-07-29 08:33:22
Shut up and take my Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-06-07 15:03:59
Most bars charge around €4.50 actually which is a good bit more than $4 unfortunately!
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:57:51
Sorry, blame auto correct. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:08:47
Exactly what I was thinking. A lazy reporter must've saw people talking about Gyft and Amazon or something.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:21:38
You know the way you can click on someone's email address in a web browser and it'll automatically open up your email client and have the email address of the person already there for you?  It's basically this but with bitcoin!
When you click on a bitcoin address for example it will open your bitcoin client and have the address of the receiver for you. So all you've got to do is enter the amount - simple.
This is big news in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:19:23
Hey! Not all of us Europeans are stupid. Ha. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:28:03
Lol. I meant "searches" as in searches on Google :) But surges probably would sound better actually.
@_date: 2013-06-02 08:43:25
There's a comedy support fund? Knock knock.....
Oh nevermind!
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:14:40

@_date: 2013-11-03 17:26:58
Tell me about it. Maybe one day we'll be that lucky ha.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:24:04
You love fiat? If I were you I'd love bitcoins more.
Ha. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:50:44
Done :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:53:52
Does this work with Amazon.co.uk? 
@_date: 2013-05-01 08:31:23
Love seeing people tip "internets" for some reason :)
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:03:48
Thanks. I got a tiny amount from them but it's honestly not worth the effort really. Was pretty cool seeing your first transaction though.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:14:58
If you plant an internet will an internet tree start to grow? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:43:37
I bet it'd reach 400 with someone the other day (think it was you!)...but they didn't take me up on it. ouch.
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:14:18
Good idea. Why not just ask them to post their wallet address (give them a link about the basics of a wallet first) and then give them a few dollars worth of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-08-07 06:14:42
Haha. Definitely going to use this if I get any tips in the future. Good work. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:00:12
Can't believe I was so stupid ha 
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:21:55
Yeah that's true probably.
Pretty much all of my customers haven't used bitcoin before so that's the problem. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:50:44
Any chance of trying this again? Bot has been acting up for me lately. Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:31:54
True, no matter what happens it should be an interesting watch. Hope he doesn't act too crazy though. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:00:04
Ahhhhh! Was going to buy some coins over the next few days. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:14:23
I have no bitcoins, maybe I should start with some litecoins haha.
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:24:29
When it reaches the moon probably. 
To the moon! ┗(°0°)┛
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:51:09
No theory behind it or anything, I'm just sick of waiting to be honest.
Want some BTC as soon as possible really!
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:39:50
Is someone a little tipsy? 
*see what I did there?*
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:22:47
You will be rich enough to retire for life soon when those 70 bitcoins are worth loads more. Let's hope so anyway. 
@_date: 2013-10-13 15:19:05
Back a few months ago I kept asking 2 strangers about bitcoin just to see how many people knew about it. I'd guess that around 20% heard of it back then. Now it's much higher at around 60% which is kind of interesting. 
Here's one convo haha. Try it out yourself and see what people think! 
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:05:15
Don't kick yourself about it. We all think 'what if we got in earlier'. 
I do it too but you're better off not doing it. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:29:42
Wow really, thanks. I don't use reddit that much apart from this subreddit so do you know if it's possible to pass it on? 
Everyone that are involved with bitcoin are so generous. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 20:28:49
This could help : 
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:09:57
Not a bad point. Life is a gamble really. Bitcoin is like a casino that gives you a buzz that lasts longer than half a minute. 
Now all I need to do is put more chips on the table soon! 
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:38:27
True yeah. That would be the .wallet file in the case of MultiBit, right?
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:42:49
Try  maybe. Used to watch BBC there months ago anyway when I wasn't in the UK. Might need to make an account nowadays, not sure. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:13:07
Would it be wrong if I tipped you a beer? Hmm... 
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:35:07
Great thanks. Another quick question - is there any reason why MultiBit creates multiple wallets for the same address? Forget what it looks like but I think it's like multibit.wallet then loads that look something like multibit-123456789.wallet etc.
Assume that .wallet is the same as .dat basically too? Great work! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:08:37
You're bitcoin_billionaire, aren't you?! Haha
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:22:38
Another noob question - is a private key enough for a good backup? Or do you also need the wallet? Using MultiBit and the wallet file is a .wallet file rather than .dat, assume its still fine?
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:12:28
Awesome. On another completely random note, you kind of sound like Leonard from the big bang theory!
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:37:19
Love the picture with 4 sections. It's so funky :D
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:02:04
Your $10 gift will probably be much more by Christmas too. Good idea. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:26:23
Got excited for a sec and thought that was to me but he deserves it more :) 
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:39:33
Don't know why either. Just because you cashed out doesn't mean you've lost faith in bitcoin. 
I only have a tiny amount of btc but maybe that little bit will buy me a car like yours next year! 
@_date: 2013-06-09 09:29:28
There's a joke to be made somewhere about a train and track being in your username, but it's just too early to think of one.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:19:57
Mtgox was heading towards $1000. Peaked at 950 for now. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 11:45:11
Someone is being really kind today! Wow.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:16:50
A bit off topic but how do you feel after selling a chunk of your bitcoins recently? 
Reason why I'm asking is because sometimes I get tempted to sell half of the little I have. There's never a right time to exit, but how do you feel about your decision? 
@_date: 2013-09-26 21:25:27
Well done, love the work she done. It's very original looking. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:03:36
For me it's more like "I should've bought some bitcoin".
Still waiting to buy my first bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:01:15
Haha yeah he done well. I think he won the debate.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:34:20
Fair play to you, agree with everything you've said here.
Life's all about taking chances - which is why I'm hoping to invest in BTC asap.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:39:17
I love the randomness of some tips here, haha. 
@_date: 2013-09-27 16:09:13
A bit off topic but I thought with multibit you need the .dat file if you want to make a backup? Can't find a wallet file? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:31:40
Go home DrunkBTC, you're drunk.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:41:43
Sorry about that guys, I was just donating some of my bitcoins to newbies.*
*I wish!

I blame MT Gox by the looks of things. That's why it isn't good to depend on mainly one site for transactions 
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:22:46
Well there goes that idea then. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:48:29
Send them a tiny amount of bitcoin and they'll soon realise how great it is.
That's what in starting to do.
@_date: 2013-06-06 22:34:58
That's true haha. Maybe could afford to get drunk here in Ireland.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:21:18
Damn, that's another thing I forgot to add. I'm sick and tired of checking my bank account all the time waiting on a payment!
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:50:12
Making a million bitcoin. 
*if only things were that simple*
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:43:59
Ireland :) Not many people here selling but the ones that are selling aren't close to me lol
@_date: 2013-05-18 19:07:54
Keep up the good work guys, seems like you're doing very well so far.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:59:53
If that link doesn't work check out my new thread I posted with the link (on my mobile so it's not the easiest thing to do!) 
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:48:06
The OP is now severely drunk. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:27:32
Just noticed loads of tips in this subreddit, weird. Keep it up :) 
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:13:16
Looks good, but I don't have a bitcointalk account so I suppose I can't do it? :(
@_date: 2013-04-28 20:23:26
Redeeming karma? Never heard of this before, quite cool.
@_date: 2013-08-02 06:26:28
That's pretty cool to be honest. Even if the price of silver goes down you've still got your 1 BTC that'll be worth more ;)
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:59:20
Wonder can you do it again ;) 
Just kidding. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:57:58
Want any more bets lol? What about $400 within a week? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:28:54
Luke, I am your father.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:31:15
No problem. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:57:41
"Impossible is nothing"
*said the guy who paid 10,000 btc for a pizza*
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:01:06
Are you the new bitcoinmillionaire? Haha. Nice one. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:37:47
I'd be interested to see if you get many chargebacks. But then again most scammers would probably be buying 0.5 BTC or 1 BTC I think?
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:23:12
Haha. Love the way all the haters are getting tips too. Keep up the good work! 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:26:15
My favourite thing is telling other people about bitcoin and seeing their face when they learn a bit about it.
I'm talking about the "Mind = BLOWN" face!
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:03:15
Any chance of trying this again mate? Thirsty for some beer :) 
@_date: 2013-05-04 17:27:56
Wish that I had 30 BTC to my name! I'm in it for the long run anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:34:59
Cheers, might pass this on to a friend who was asking me loads of questions about bitcoins recently. I know that's how I got started.
@_date: 2013-09-27 19:01:17
Weird. All I know is that when I've ever used multibit I only get a .dat file. I always thought this was the backup but could be wrong. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:47:36
They may be laughing now, but soon laughter will turn in to tears when they find out they might have missed the boat.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:43:10
See my last comment, should be able to stream it. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:40:26
Oh I never knew you could tip a fraction of a beer - nice.
Here in Ireland we can use the bitcointip to tip 1.5 beers to allow us to buy one beer haha. (That's just a guess!)
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:57:22
Deposited money today, let's see how long it takes!
@_date: 2013-05-09 22:19:07
Hopefully this will help you out. Probably not much point calling me since it'll cost you a few dollars a minute (or a few bitcoins a minute!) since I'm in Europe.
Like many people, months ago I started to hear lots about bitcoin. Although I had heard of it before this, it was no where near as much as this, and after receiving my first tip right here on Reddit I suddenly got really interested in it. So, I decided to buy a decent amount of BTC. 
Found it quite hard to find a good exchange but I ended up using bitcoin24 and the process was much easier than I expected (unfortunately bitcoin24 had some trouble recently though). Since then I've been helping other people get involved with bitcoin and even done an interview with a fairly big site about it.
Hopefully this helps you out, if you haven any questions send me a message.
Edit - Probably should've added: I bought in at around $140, went up to $265 as you more than likely know but I don't really have any regrets.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:13:57
As far as I know it just gives you money so you can buy when you want to :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:46:55
He pretty much means "how are things going with this? "
@_date: 2013-08-04 10:09:03
That is a lot. Is that your only address? There's much better things you could spend your BTC on, be careful.
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:51:23
I keep thinking that I'm too late to the party, have to change!
@_date: 2013-05-05 07:07:52
On the top of r/bitcoin now! I'm not even going to attempt this though, haven't a clue how to do it. Might look over the steps that you posted though.
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:29:04
Nice early Christmas present. How cool. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:26:30
It was you, ha. 
You didn't accept it, but I wish you did :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:56:11
Posted a thread earlier telling people about this, but if you missed it here's a video of what happened.
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:13:49
Didn't work for done reason. Anyway, looks like this won't take off. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:29:28
Don't think that works but could be wrong. Check out in the sidebar for info though. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:24:02
I once spent millions on a pizza. 
Worst. Day. Ever. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:18:53
Bitcoin 24, someone here on reddit recommended them to me and it was easy. No verification or anything like that.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:53:43
Hard to believe that this kind of thing happens in this day and age. Feel so sorry for everyone in Cyprus.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:33:55
Yay thanks :) Damn tip bot must've robbed 2 beers! 
Thanks again, will pass on to friends. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:11:37
They don't give you that for free do they? Must look in to that.
@_date: 2013-07-04 17:10:02
Done, 
(Same username as on here)
@_date: 2013-08-21 20:13:51
Does anyone know if multibit changes every transaction (or how many transactions it takes before it does)? 
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:58:24
Those a good ideas for subreddits actually, once I get my bitcoins (hopefully tomorrow when my transfer clears) I'll try send some tips to people.
@_date: 2013-09-24 19:10:08
It says bitcoin is dead, surely this can't be right? 
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:54:13
Thank you. Not a member on there  (not sure why!) but maybe I'll join soon. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:49:54
I also hope he/she sees this, heh :)
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:58:41
I'll take that. How much are you betting? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:08:43
Thought this was interesting, looks like Kevin is back in, probably a smart time too before the US make a statement or whatever. 
Anyone know what time this will be at? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:47:51
Someone trying to DDOS reddit now? Haha.
@_date: 2013-07-24 06:26:39
I could probably help too, message me if you want.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:10:52
Be careful with buying pizza. You know what happened to that other guy :P
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:02:00
To the sky! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:20:37
Imagine being one of them and watching the recent increase. Wow. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:48:38
What the hell is going on here? That's amazing haha. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 09:12:45
*cough* hello *cough*
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:42:21
Moar links? 
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:01:51
Out of interest, have you had any buyers paying by bitcoin? I've an ebook that I wouldn't mind selling for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:47:30
*Omnomnomnom*
