There is a reason exchange rates are what they are. Countries like China manipulate their currency. 
You claim Bitcoin to be global but then you exclude US? Oh the hypocrisy!
Some people see no charge backs as a negative. Imagine you buy something to find out you got ripped off on product quality and everything about your product is shit or fake, what's your recourse then? 
You are only making a point for travel benefits, but the fact is, if your CC is stolen your CC company can block transactions and even reverse them, whereas if your wallet is stolen and people are able to access it via pin code brute force (assuming you use a pin to access your wallet) well then you lose everything. Cash would be gone too, so if you plan on using crypto better not load it up more than your wallet's cash-equivalent.

Ver clever.

Wouldn't that put them back on the same playing field with credit card companies who can do the exact same thing?

When institutions buy bitcoin they are not buying it on the market, they are buying one day futures where the demand is filled on an internal ledger operated by Bakkt, and funds coming out of the seller, who also stores on Bakkt. Do you see where I am going with this? There will be no record of the trades on the bitcoin blockchain itself - they say so themselves - it's the only way they can support large volume transactions due to bitcoin's inherent limitations. There is no reason why the price would increase if all of the transactions are internal. Sure, there will be fluctuations due to decrease in supply, but that in itself has nothing to do with institutional money propping up bitcoin.

Do you have any evidence of this? I imagine OTC suppliers get their bitcoin over time so that purchases do not affect the value. For every buyer there is always a seller and the middle usually doesn't shift much when isolated from everything else that impacts value. So when an OTC seller sells, this likely does not impact the market price at all. Eventually, as hedge funds trade between one another, it can all be done internally within Bakkt without the need to stimulate the market.   
Please prove me wrong. I am here to see if anyone has any logical responses that say otherwise.

Wouldn't more trade just create a steadier price and LESS volatility? I mean.. I think that's the entire reason why Bakkt is to be created - to lessen the volatility of crypto. They say so themselves in interviews.

In all fairness, Bill Clinton will talk positively about a turd if you pay him enough.

I just don't buy it. For that to happen (price to stabilize for mass use) you'd need everyone using bitcoin and do away with cash. Most people are too dumb to know how to make payments on a phone (no matter what type), cash will never lose its place in the world. As long as people are using cash instead of exchanging it for yet another type of payment method, there really is no need for bitcoin. Store of value, sure, I buy that, but transactions ... nah.

why would anyone want to use a currency that increases in price? You want your currency to be as stable as possible not jump up and down.

True as it may be, when a team of researchers say "seems to" doesn't exactly inspire any sort of confidence in their research. If you are going to announce something like this, you better be damn sure what you say is true, or don't say it.
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:24:26
I don't think Bitcoin will ever be used as a currency as there is simply no means of stabilising value. You can't use something as currency when it constantly fluctuates wildly. Even if you have stablecoins, some central authority requires the fund to be in line with demand. What happens when demand exceeds stablecoin supply? Well.. you get unstable coin lol. Oh, and if you simply print more than it's no longer backed by fiat. Bitcoin, if anything, will replace gold as a store of value imo.

I've been following various subs for a long time and the notes on this chart EXACTLY depict general sub sentiments in these periods. Funny.

He clearly states it is a personal account which means his opinions are personal and not those of the company. Hype totally unnecessary.

Actually, their POS does exactly the same thing as a bitcoin atm, lets you purchase directly. So... no fanfare.

Point being, the scam site mentions its own brand a mere 5 times while trying to ride on the good name of Bitcoin as seen in Find screen.
