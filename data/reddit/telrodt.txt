I've never heard them recommend that, anytime I've closed it's always gone to one account.

I do the paper wallet thing. I also keep a backup copy with my own stash so in a year when it's worth 10X and they've lost it you can help them out...
I gave a buddy $25 worth last year for his birthday, now it's worth over $300...

They are not the most secure option, but for $20...meh. At a point it may make sense to sweep it onto a hardware wallet or something.  Do a search on paper wallets in the sub and you'll see lots of posts about how to make them more secure (taking computer offline to generate address/etc.). 
*edit, - I want to add that there are people selling paper wallets on ebay and other places. DO NOT BUY OR USE THESE! If someone has a copy (which they obviously do) they have as much access to the BTC as you do. Only print your own.

Ugh. That's right where my last buy ended up with the commission.  I've been buying little amounts for a long time, so my cost average is fine, but still....bought right at the top!

Whew. [joke](

I was running a 1000W space heater to keep my basement office warm. I picked up a Bitmain S7-ln for $350, now I'm heating the space and hashing about .015btc/week. 
FYI. They're noisy. I want to get an R4.

The ATM statement isn't true. The assumption made by the author is that an ATM uses the same amount of energy as an ASIC. I have ATM's and I have ASIC's, the amount of power used by an ATM is negligible in comparison. My ATM is run by a 300watt PSU, and it's only fully utilized when the machine is running the motors for the dispenser and the thermal printer. I'd be surprised if total power usage was over 300 watts per day. My L3+'s on the other hand, use around 19,000 watts per day. S9's would use 30% more. 
I do believe we are in an in efficient phase of development. Technology will make hashing easier and reduce the footprint over time. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:28:24
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:24:07
That's exactly it.

Adoption will increase value.  While they are technically not directly linked one drives the other.  Thinking of each Bitcoin attribute in a silo doesn't help me when considering the whole picture.  
You are right though, mining just confirms transactions.
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:40:56
You are correct, though I can't imagine a scenario where adoption increases and value does not, so I consider them linked.

The same way it already has, take a look at the watts/hash over time.  When we say something "hashes faster" it's really just hashing more efficiently. We still throw 1000-1300 watts at it (because it's an easy amount for an electrical system to handle) but we get way more hashes/second. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:31:31
True, but if we were mining at today's difficulty with the old GPU rigs power consumption we'd be looking at way more power being used (and a highly unprofitable scenario).  I haven't done the math on watt hours per block, or watt hours per transaction but it'd be interesting. It'd be even more interesting to compare that across different currencies. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:55:01
It think it will be a combination of both power consumption increases and increasing efficiency as the network grows.  I believe it's going to yo-yo around as the price of electricity, the value of bitcoin and efficiency of the system all try to find a stable economic state.
If demand for electricity goes up too much, the price will become prohibitive to mine. If the value of bitcoin crashes, miners will shut down. If the difficulty gets too high to support the value, miners will shut down (I just turned my L3 off, I need LTC to be over $100 otherwise it's cheaper to just buy it instead of mine it). 
Also though, I work for a solar company developing utility-scale (10-150MW) solar projects. We will be happy to meet the increasing power consumption demands!
I can also be completely wrong (and likely will be), I hate trying to predict the future. 
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:09:08
That's not how it works.
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:40:25
Thanks for the links and the recommendation. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:39:38
Thanks. This compliance thing is discouraging.  
It looks like my location is right across the street from another one of your machines- what are the odds?! Probably too close for comfort eh?
I may still send you a note when I get things a bit more sorted out, I do want to understand the regulatory hurdles better.
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:13:29
Thanks for the advice, I'm not interested in under the radar operations either.

No data to back it up, but I'd compare it to digital music. MP3 players showed up in the late 90's. Then iPod. Napster was there letting everyone steal content. People at that time were still skeptical though, they wanted to own that silly piece of plastic. Eventually though, everyone realized having to actually buy a CD was totally pointless and now they're a relic.
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:30:39
I'm not forcing anyone to do anything, and that's a silly reason to avoid Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:20:53
I get the impression he was just looking for an excuse to cut a nut off  and r/Bitcoin was the unfortunate vehicle. Get some help OP.
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:55:28
Agreed, r/investing is to talk about stocks and bonds, most over there don't even like real estate.

Running miners is about like running a hairdryer, only louder, 24 hrs a day.  It is unwise.

In China maybe, in the US it has become more expensive than anything but nuclear. Wind power in Oklahoma is some of the cheapest power I've seen, wholesale prices below $.02, kWh. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:50:04
Drop? 
I just checked and it's up $600 from a week ago. I just checked again and it's up $1,185 from a month ago! I just again, again and it's up $2,119 from a year ago!!!
None of this will happen in a straight line. Why do think the rollercoaster guy is always on the front page?
