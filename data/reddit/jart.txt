If it wasn't hackers taking his money, then it would have been friends, family, casinos, and the luxury goods salesmen who prey on the nouveau riche. Money doesn't stay long in the hands of most people. For example, 78% of NFL players go bankrupt within two years after retiring. The only people who are good at keeping money are the folks who don't care about money.

The [Bitcoin paper]( actually says, "Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism." 
The only consensus appears to be among big mining pools, which updated their software to be capable of creating 2MB blocks. Big blocks means big miners can probably earn more on transaction fees, so why not implement the capability? Consensus for SegWit2x among [developers]( seems overwhelmingly negative. Consensus among [full nodes]( is to use the core client.
Most of the consensus building for Bitcoin Cash and SegWit2x, outside miners, appears to have been among centralized [Bitcoin service providers]( I'm not even sure what the secure trustworthy software is for using these forks as a client. Plus big blocks will probably make it impossible to run a full node on a PC. So it kind of defeats the whole point of the original paper.

Wait is this real life? Someone's mom on Reddit can't even Google and a new product appears with a major U.S. retailer as a result?

Segwit is a Wow expansion that allows the game to run faster on everyone's computer.
SegWit2x is WoW v2 with graphics twice as awesome, but you have to upgrade your video card. The problem is you already have a $500 GeForce GTX 1080. So in order to play WoW v2 you'd have to buy a $5,000 Tesla P100 and a new computer that's compatible with it. Typically only engineers at big businesses get to use that kind of hardware.
But then, after the WoW v2 update goes live, the WoW v1 servers get taken offline. You end up really sad because you can't play the game anymore.

Wow, that's some bitter, condescending, and vindictive advice. Is it your own personal remorse for bad bitcoin investing decisions that causes you to feel this way?
