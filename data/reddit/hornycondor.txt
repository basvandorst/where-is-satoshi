Right so you are "able to", because it gets around certain regulations (like drugs are bad, mmmk) which is a whole lot different than "required" (which suggests not only government approval, but mandate). 
Semantics, I know. But C'mon, words matter.

My point there was just that bitcoin has no intrinsic value, the demand for it is purely speculative which can bottom out (granted, I think we are past the point of it going to zero in any foreseeable future). Etherium has additional demand in that institutions can piggyback off its block chain creating true utility demand.

If I wanted it to buy drugs I'd be far more willing to 1) pay whatever they wanted 2) jump through whatever hoops. 
But this basically proves my point, if the two options are "super serious investor" or "clearly wants to buy drugs" then at most one maybe two percent of people will ever actually buy bitcoin..... Etherium on the other hand

It might be the only method that people can use in countries with oppressive regimes, but in no country is "bitcoin required by law" that's just ridiculous

Yeah, but there's still like a 14-15% premium for buying via PayPal (which appears to be the cheapest option)
