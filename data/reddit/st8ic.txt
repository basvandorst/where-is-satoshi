Wait I thought we all agreed to buy the shit out of the dip so that the infinite money machine keeps going forever?

It's almost impressive how little sense that made. Enjoy all your free lunch.

We're talking about what defines a bull run, not how you feel about your investment.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:11:20
the non-smug-asshole way to say this is "I've been averaging down. I'm currently $10k in the red on paper."
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:52:14
by that logic, no bull run ever finishes as long as you cherry pick your time scale.

By the sounds of it, it won't be an exchange for retail traders like you and me. It's for big institutions, so it will probably come with huge costs to entry and huge minimum order flow like their other HFT pools.  
There probably won't be an "interface" because orders will probably use an existing protocol supported by existing tools that these guys use.

I don't know man, you seem to be hell bent on believing that fiat currency either somehow caused the crisis or contributed to the effects, but can't show or describe how. At first you said that printing the fiat currency for the bailout devalued the USD, which sounds reasonable, but I provided evidence that there was no severe inflation in 2008 or in the 10 years since then.  
I get it, I like Bitcoin too. I believe that it has key advantages over fiat currency too. But we still have to make logical statements which are found in evidence instead of hand waving to try and make fiat currency sound dangerous.
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:05:21


Okay, so you're saying that the government printed money to cover the bailout in 2008, causing high inflation? [Because that's not true at all]( Most of the bailout money either came from operational budget or the government selling securities.
  


Read up on the 2008 crisis.


Yes. Exactly.
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:20:07
okay, please explain how it offers a safe haven. I assume you mean to people who have mortgages when the next housing bubble pops?
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:05:56
yes that sounds like a sound investment strategy
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:23:56
2008 happened because of a housing bubble and credit raters mischaracterizing the risk on home loans. Please explain how Bitcoin will prevent that.

Lol wut? I'm saying that just because you notice a pattern doesn't guarantee that pattern will continue forever. Idk what you're talking about with this "growing and shrinking" shit.

It's called arbitrage and there are already a lot of bots doing it.

so everyone can make infinite money if they just bought a TA book? Someone alert Wall street!

No, 50% of people make returns and 50% lose. Some percentage "live like ballers" because they're on the tail of the distribution, but assume it's because they're gEnIuS tRaDeRs.

I'm pretty psyched because I've never died therefore I'm immortal! Surely this extrapolation will hold true forever.
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:29:12
oh okay, so TA is a free lunch which defies the economic law of gravity but only for smart people? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:31:28


You realize that the inverse is also true, right? A tulip bulb is only worth a billion dollars when people decide they are willing to buy them for a billion dollars.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:48:29
Again, inverse. What about pets.com?  
  
I'm just saying that everything you say goes both directions. Someone reading your posts could extrapolate that every asset is always worth an infinite number of dollars.

people need to stop endlessly extrapolating exponential growth.  
  
That's how you end up eating your dick on national TV.
@_date: 2018-12-12 02:52:23
Huh? If you extrapolate the curve for another 6 years, 1 BTC is worth more than the entire world GDP. So where do you stop extrapolating?
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:28:59
You can interpret "previously unresolved" however you like, but [there were actually many solutions to the problem before bitcoin's algorithm](
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:05:18


This is probably the most misleading thing I've ever read.
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:21:16
saying that BFT was an "unresolved problem" which was "solved" by the bitcoin developers is utterly misleading. It implies that it was thought that BFT was NP-hard and they found a polynomial time algorithm.  
The proof-of-work solution is innovative, yes, but it's not solving a problem that was previously thought to be impossible to solve.
