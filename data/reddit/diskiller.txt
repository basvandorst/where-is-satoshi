This looks like the correct theory.

Well I tried all different values, including as low as 0.1 but it won't go and still gives the same (new) error message.
They haven't made their press release statement yet, so maybe they will re-enable withdrawals shortly... when they release their statement.

I'm not even in the US, never been a temporary resident. I'm an Australian Citizen. But I use coin base. I have a Bank of America account. Anyone can open a US bank account, and it is in fact useful to do so because I have a US credit card / debit card.

Because coinbase is not a bitcoin day trading site, its a site to buy or sell bitcoins but its sloooow.
People use Gox/Bitstamp/Bitfinex/etc to day trade.
Your friend might not be used to the idea of daytrading bitcoin and of course you would never do that with coinbase, so the idea of leaving your money sitting around on coinbase is insanity.
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:30:27
I've been with bitcoin since early 2011. Started mining on cpu (jan 2011) and gpu back then.
My problems are:
1) The increasing price of bitcoin is causing prices of items on to have ever increasing number of decimals. I guess humans are not used to seeing prices of $0.00013 for example. Yes we have cents but things are rarely less than a dollar these days anyway (depending on country).
2) Exchanging BTC to/from Fiat. This has been challenging to say the least. For me personally, Australian and New Zealand banks block wires to known bitcoin exchanges like MtGox and BitStamp and possibly others. (and of course, exchanges like MtGox being unable to do withdrawals is another huge problem.) And I hear US Banks simply close your bank account if they see you having anything to do with bitcoin. I have a Bank of America account as well and have used coinbase and am worried they might close my account. :/
Yes I know localbitcoins exists and I've used it but the spread between the buy/sell price is MASSIVE on localbitcoins. It would be nice if there was a convenient/cheap way to convert bitcoins to fiat.
Someone else mentioned security. I don't have a problem with security but I can see this being a huge problem for the majority of the population. Perhaps this is a way where our current banks can get involved with bitcoins. Provide a location to store bitcoins (sure they can convert to fiat in the background if they need to and only storing a small %) and also provide fiat to bitcoin exchange services.
Of course, I doubt they will do this cheaply but then again our existing exchanges aren't exactly cheap. But I do believe it is possible for our banking system to survive with bitcoin, they just need to embrace it.
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:37:26
Due to bankruptcy laws, and such?
Bitcoin isn't a real currency and so anyone holding btc in a company that goes bankrupt will never see their money, but if you have USD you may see money as creditors must be paid when a company goes bankrupt.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:10:03
Please throw that fucker in jail.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:33:06
I believe what's happened is the huge increase in value of bitcoin (from ~low 2 digit) to 3 digit and then 4 digits has meant the fees are proportionally large.
Whilist before when BTC was worth say $10 you might send 10 or 20 btc for a purchase, now you might send 1 btc or 0.1 btc.
The fees were fixed at 0.001 btc for example (depending on client) and are now disproportionally large. Hence the planned 10x reduction in the next version of the client.
Yeah I did a really bad job explaining that but you should get the idea.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:25:16

Ummm.... Japanese Law? The, you know, country that Mt.Gox operates in?
Look, this may be really difficult for an American to understand - I know - but there's more than one country out there. There's like over 200. And each country has its own laws, rules, and regulations.
People, Businesses, and Corporations need to abide by the local laws of the country in which they are based.
Mt.Gox is based in Japan. It therefore has to abide by Japanese Law. Including Japanese bankruptcy laws if it comes to that. Now I haven't checked, but Japan probably doesn't consider Bitcoin a real currency like JPY, USD, CAD, AUD, etc....
Just saying.
US law has absolutely butt fucking NOTHING to do with this as Mt.Gox ain't in the fucking US. The only time it DID matter was when it opened US bank accounts and used a US subsidiary and broke US law in the way it used its US bank accounts.
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:10:10
Good article. I, too, often transfer money internationally (between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States) as I travel between these countries often.
I used to live/work in Australia, I now live/work in New Zealand, and whilst I only visit the US I intend to move/live/work there too. And I invest in the US stock market using a US platform.
So I transfer money around. I've used SWIFT, I've used Bitcoin, and I've used PayPal. I've never used Western Union though.
I've had good success with all. (Unrelated, I am a believer in Bitcoin and got into Bitcoin in early 2011 but i'm not biased towards it for transferring money.)
I think (at present) my personal favourite is using a third party forex service. I personally use CurrencyOnline ( and (there are a few others) for getting the best exchange rate with the lowest fees.
Honestly, getting a good exchange rate between AUD/NZD/USD (for me) or CNY/USD for you is probably the biggest factor. For large transfers it can save you a lot of money, more than slight differences in fees.
Especially since US banks charge fees to receive money and charge higher fees for receiving SWIFT transfers. (At least Bank of America does. Yeah yeah, I know they're evil.) My third party forex service uses a domestic deposit to my US bank account which reduces fees drastically.
So anyway, try a Forex Firm. :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:44:30
Honestly, something like this should be done, funded by exchange rate fees.
Maybe capped at 10btc per person.
I know silkroad is refunding all lost bitcoins through trading fees.
But with Gox gone, well... should it really be up to other exchanges to use fees to raise the money to restore the losses of those who had money stuck in Gox? I don't know.
Disclaimer: I lost money on Gox (some 9.9btc) I was trying to withdraw it for a long time then the withdraw got cancelled and refunded to my account, then BTC withdraws were halted. I also had USD I was tring to withdraw for some 4-5 months but never went anywhere. I really got Goxxed, could never get my money out but I was trying. :(
I doubt my case is atypical.

The sad fact is, I'd been trying to get my money out of Gox since July 2013. sigh.
They made it really really really difficult, in the end I had to convert my USD to BTC to get it out but gox's BTC price was always above every other exchange (for that reason).
When I finally tried to do it, several weeks before gox disable withdrawals, my btc withdraw got stuck and never went anywehre. They eventually cancelled it, refunded my btc and.. oh disabled btc withdraws.
Fuck I got goxxed.
I knew the place was bad and spent 8 months trying to escape that dump but couldn't.
I doubt I'm the only one, in fact this is probably a pretty common story.

Never. Ever. EVER. Use an Exchange (or any other website) as a Wallet. EVER.
Do you want to get Goxxed?
Or what about all the people that lost their money on other online exchanges or wallets in the past? So many countless have been hacked.
Or even on deep web sites like Sheep Market place or Silk Road.
Honestly, at this point, there's very few sites left that haven't been hacked and had their coins stolen.
NEVER EVER EVER LEAVE ALL YOUR COINS ON AN ONLINE SITE/AUCTION SITE AND USE IT AS A WALLET.
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:20:58
Yeahhh... you're probably right. But people invest in property, shares, and gold because they expect the price to go up. They expect that that someone later will pay more for it than they did initially, hence my comment.
Prime example was house flipping in the US before the collapse.

When I tried to transfer $20k USD from my Commonwealth Bank Account in New Zealand to Bitstamp they emailed me 2 days later saying they cancelled it because they deem it to be of unacceptable high risk and returned the money and SWIFT transfer fee to me.
I don't get how THEY get to decide its of unacceptable high risk. It's my fucking money and I should be able to do what I want with it.
This was about 4 months ago now.
I have a Commonwealth Bank account in Australia too but never bothered to use them to try to xfer money to bitstamp/gox because at this point I knew the same thing would happen.
Your best bet might be to try using a 3rd party money transfer service like currencyonline.com but they too might not let you transfer money anymore. (They used to work for me in the past though. Back in 2012 or so I xferred money to gox using currencyonline.com)
I now use localbitcoins.com a lot in both AU and NZ (I'm on there as AusKiwiBitcoins) or I use coinbase. (I have a US bank account as well.)
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:47:59
Dude, banks reverse transactions all the time, claw back money, and worst of all, pull money out of thin fucking air all the time (ie. every time they give someone a loan.)
It happens every day in the financial industry all over the world.
So yeah, its something to consider here, as a one off bail out type of scenario if this is what really happened.
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:04:09
I have btc on gox and I ain't selling.
I think the rationale is that if Gox is indeed bankrupt you're far more likely to see some of your money if its in USD. If its in BTC, you will never see it as it won't be covered by bankrupty law as its not seen as a real currency.
That said, i'm holding on... at this point I may as well lose all my money than 70% of its value by selling at $240.

This thread and the other original thread has to be the most depressing thing I have ever read on reddit.
The sad thing is you keep ignoring everyone's advice and keep reposting the same question - starting new threads - and basically still trying to figure out how to double your money.
I trippled my money on bitcoin, then lost a ton in the crash you are reffering to. Shit happens. I didn't lose it all and am still ahead. My biggest mistake was selling all my mined coins a few years back and not buying/holding onto bitcoin back in Jan 2011 when I started on bitcoin. Shit happens. I only started buying in April.
Original thread: 
I'm finding myself in a really difficult situation because I got caught up in the bitcoins hype over the past few weeks. I used the next 2 months rent/bill money to purchase coins because I thought I'd be able to double it, sell half to pay bills and keep the rest for the future.
When the price crashed, I panick sold my coins for $590 because I thought I could buy back lower. It's been going back up but I've been waiting for it to crash again but it hasn't happened yet. What are the chances it will go below $600 again? I find myself in the position of not having enough money for next months rent and bills and I'm not sure what to do and I need the money back.
Should I buy more coins at the current price and hope it doubles before the 28th Dec so I can sell and pay my rent and bills? I am thinking about selling my car and using some funds to pay the next few months rent/bills and use the rest for buying more bitcoins and waiting until the price hits the target Max Keiser mentioned. That's why I initially purchased the coins because Max gave me the impression this was a sure win and it's all be going up so much. I wish I bought Quark instead because it's gone back up and Max and Bill Still recommended it at the same time I got the bitcoins.
I feel so stupid and I don't know what to do. Even if I buy back in now, I'm not going to have enough for rent/bills unless the price doubles so I can break even at least. I'm hoping it crashes a bit more so I can buy and waiting for it to go back up before end of the year.
