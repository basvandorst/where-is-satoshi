If whats you say is true, why does a 1 ounce American Gold Eagle cost 3%-6% less for Crypto/Wire/Check than the Credit Card price?
If what you say is true, why does BankRate advise readers to negotiate to pay cash instead of using credit to lower the total costs of the transaction?
If what you say is true, why does the Frank-Dodd Act prohibit any payment card network "from inhibiting the ability of anyone to provide a discount for payment by cash, checks, debit cards"?
What about these guys?
* Commercial compost processing facility -&gt; 
* The biggest precious metals dealer on the internet -&gt; 
* A Chiropractor -&gt;  -&gt; 
* Auto dealer network -&gt;  -&gt; 
... and tens-to-hundreds of thousands other businesses.
I mean, none of them are trying to hide from and screw the IRS out of taxes with those huge paper trails, server logs, record-keeping, invoices and receipts, and blatant cash discount advertising, and since credit card sales are faster, require less human input and labor, why do you suppose that they do it... if not to save money for themselves and their customers from the high credit card fees??
Why does anyone offer cash discounts if what you say is true?
Or are you simply here to spread disinformation and manipulate others?

No, the buyers of products and services pay more.


This is incorrect. There are discounts for cash sales for most products and services. You just got to look for them and/or negotiate them.


Sure... minor percentages on rotating quarterly categories (not every purchase for every category), and you need to opt-in for every category every quarter, else the cash back is not applied. They have caps on the amount of cash back as well as cash back on *select* purchases from *select* businesses. There is no card that rewards you with unlimited and universal cash back (only all-the-time cash back is 1% cash back cards with capped limits), like you have with all-the-time discounts for cash sales.
Certainly, there are some great incentives occasionally using credit cards, and people who can manage their credit effectively should utilize those offers when financially feasible.


This is disingenuous. You pay the fees to the seller who has them figured into the prices for products and services that are often discounted when cash is used. That's why I can get 5%-20% off of a product and/or when using cash that you can't get using credit.


I was not referring to interest, but since you brought it up, most people eventually carry a balance and *will* end up paying interest. This discussion does not concern interest however.


Everyone using credit pays more in the long run.


I disagree.

What am I missing here?
Is full disk encryption illegal?
Are they trying to make it illegal?
I can see that it's loosely-related to Bitcoin, because Full Disk Encryption protects your Bitcoin against physical theft of the hard drive (so long as you have the walled backed up) and unauthorized access to a powered-down system containing the Bitcoin wallet.

Either buy a miner and mine yourself or buy the coins and hodl. More often than not, cloud mining operations will rip you off one way or another eventually. Perhaps not all of them, but most of them. Especially after whoever is running them gets a nice stockpile of bitcoins and becomes less interested in the maintenance of their service, or they go bankrupt and the creditors claim your coins.

Fee means every penny paid using a CC over and above the price paid using Bitcoin or cash/check/wire, most of which is hidden into the price of the product or service the seller is offering.


Yes, Bitcoin certainly does, as does cash/check/wire.

I generally buy from locally-owned and operated family businesses, because I believe in keeping as much money as possible in my local community. That said, if you search around, you will find many that will give cash discounts.
Here in my neck of the woods...
The grocery store discounts cash sales.
The coin and currency shop and every online precious metals merchant I've ever used discounts cash sales.
The appliance store discounts cash sales.
The roofing guy discounts cash sales.
The tool rental store discounts for cash sales. 
The auto body shop discounts cash sales.
The auto mechanic / repair shop discounts cash sales.
The plumber discounts cash sales.
The window guy discounts cash sales.
The flooring store discounts cash sales.
The farmers market merchants discount cash sales.
The flea market merchants discount cash sales.
All the local farmers I use discount cash sales.
The furniture store discounts cash sales.
My favorite diner discounts cash sales.
My favorite bar/restaurant discounts cash sales.
Even my suppliers discount for cash sales when I pay by check instead of credit, even though I used my credit rating for a 30-days-net credit account. They deliver to me and I later pay the invoice with a check that's treated as cash so long as I remit within 30 days.
And yes, even my favorite shady gas stations discounts cash sales.

He's plainly quite terrified. 
Plus, everyone was laughing and basically trying to shame anyone advocating bitcoin, just like they did when Bitcoin started... Yet, here they are talking about it and governments, think tanks, and large financial institutions and corporations are testing the tech, using the tech, implementing the tech, having hearings about it, lobbying, attempting to regulate and control it, and making laws concerning it.
But, but, but it's just play internet monopoly money... 
They're terrified of it, because it represents the end of their theft, control, cheating and corruption.

The only loss would be the fees, which are generally much less than credit card fees. Conversion is based on real-time pricing data and based on the value of the product or service that you're selling.
If you make a $400 sale right now, you get 1 Bitcoin minus the fees. You can instantly convert this to cash, which still gives you $400 minus the fees. There are no fees for conversion that I know of. Just fees for use of the service, which are still less than credit card fees.

The countless communities and people who were not affected by nor afflicted with
* Polio 
* Tetanus 
* Rabies 
* Yellow fever 
* Whooping cough 
* Measles 
* Smallpox 
would disagree with you.
So would the people who died horrible and debilitating deaths as well as their families and communities caring for them and were affected by the diseases.
My grandmothers' sister died when she was a child. I never got to know her. She died from Polio before the vaccine was widely distributed.
Sure, there may be some issues with bad actors and vaccine side effects with a minute percentage of individuals, but I wouldn't suggest an avoidable error in which something good is eliminated when trying to get rid of something bad. In other words, rejecting the essential along with the non-essential is pure folly that would lead to hundreds of millions of debilitations and deaths from these vaccine-erradicated illnesses.

It's not Paypal that's allowing the chargebaks. It's the credit card companies they are under contract with.
Edit: Paypal has no choice in the matter, as they are performing their contractual obligations. You need to fight the credit card company and/or the person who used the credit card.
