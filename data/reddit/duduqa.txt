It´s just a matter of time until "consumer protection" talk from government becomes more recognizably hypocritical. After those guys (internationally speaking) speed up the plundering of pension funds and savings accounts (not to mention the delay of bond maturities), such "recommendations" (a collection of a million abstract substantives, without any practical sentence) will become more and more unpopular and irrelevant.

Let me offer a different perspective. Putting money into bitcoin for some people isn´t only an investment decision. It is also an act of liberation and idealism/protest. Every single fiat you throw away in exchange for a bitcoin is a small punch on tyranny´s face. It is one of the most efficient things one can do to change the world for better. 
We are talking about the ultimate open source global value ledger, not suitable for confiscation, very difficult to tax and easy to transfer worldwide. We should praise and admire those who go full BTC. I wish I had the guts, it would make my life more meaningful as someone under 40 with no kids.

So many flaws with that thinking:
1- The "billionaire" wouldn´t need to buy all coins for 1,000,000 USD, just a tiny fraction of the last one. 
2- It implies that ALL coins would be sold...that no idealist, early adopter, bitcoin evangelist would keep a fraction of a bitcoin. 
3- It doesn´t consider that, as the price moves up quickly, more people/investors/institutional capital would be motivated to get onboard. 
4- It does not consider lost coins (old HD, forgotten passwords etc).
5- It does not consider the FED money printing (week after week it is more probable that new billionaires appear)
I am not envisioning a 1,000,000 USD/bitcoin this year, but it may be way closer than 99% of people think (even in this optimistic subreddit).

As my friend knows better than anyone else, the writer of this piece misses something quite importante in brazilian bitcoin scene: p2p exchanges. 
Brazilians are huge users of social media, and the facebook Brasil Bitcoin group ( has over 10,000 members. There are Whatsapp and facebook groups exclusively dedicated to buying and selling bitcoin. 
We can buy bitcoin through zipzap (max US$ 400/day) paying cash at any bank or most of drugstores. We have 4 or 5 operating exchanges. 
There is pagcoin.com, a payment processor which is setting up  some deals with e-commerces (expect many many more to be announced). A friendly government attitude would be a major plus, but I guess the bitcoin Jeannie is well out of the bottle here in Brazil.

Brazilian bitcoin enthusiast here. Essentially all brazilians have easy access to banks and banking services. Official inflation runs around 6% so it is not that bad. Credit card tax is around 6.8%. 
Until Bitpay starts operations here, bitcoins will remain mostly as (in that order) 1-volatile investment 2-tax evasion tool 3-mechanism of remittance.
We will probably have to wait until another bubble, higher taxes/inflation or the federal government confiscating in a Cyprus-style (which would be a political suicide, as people´s memory of such a move in 1991 are reasonably fresh).

Diga, Diogo! Velho, tem um bom número de pessoas comprando e vendendo coins em Curitiba, em SP, no Norte, Nordeste...onde vc menos imagina!
Quanto à cotação, pense no seguinte: loja nenhuma aceita ouro, e a soma de todo o ouro do mundo dá 7 a 8 trilhões de dólares. Agora imagine o bitcoin mordendo um pedaço do mercado do ouro, outro dos bonds nacionais (na medida em que ele ocupa portfolio de investimentos), das moedas em circulação para compra e venda? 
Lembre-se que o bitcoin é criptograficamente protegido contra confiscos e matematicamente protegido contra inflação. Estamos falando na possibilidade de atingir um valor total de trilhão ou trilhões de dólares. Qual o valor atual de TODOS os BTC (mesmo os formatados, perdidos, senhas esquecidas): 8 bi de dolares!
Esse mundo é imenso e vivemos numa era acelerada...cuidado p nao ficar com papeis que nao valem nada em sua mao.

I am waiting for the response from blockchain.info.
EDIT: I got an e-mail and the development team is investigating it.

Thanks for your message, my friend. I guess you did the wise thing, at least until they release some kind of report.

Thief: address generated over and over and over every time I generated a new address on blockchain.info´s app
New: generated by Mycelium App AFTER the hack (although I had the app installed well BEFORE the hack). 
@_date: 2015-05-28 12:38:13
Do you think so? Maybe the only feature of this hack could be the generation of a prespecified address (which keys are controled by the thief) instead of a random one. That seems a bit more probable to me. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 23:45:06
Thank you so much!!

@_date: 2015-05-27 01:22:05
I tried to generate new addresses after that, and the app creates the same address: 1Bn9ReEocMG1WEW1qYjuDrdFzEFFDCq43F
@_date: 2015-05-27 07:35:06
Thank you, but would you expect me to Google every new address the app generates?

@_date: 2015-05-29 01:24:52
I could release the screenshots of my e-mail conversations if blockchain.info authorizes so. 
I was so happy when I read that I would get my 6 BTC back that I wanted to scream it to the world. They did not ask me to write a word in order to get back my stolen 6 BTC. Actually I wanted to tell reddit and my friends about it, and I asked if I could disclose it before their post on their blog. 
EDIT: the offer of 20 BTC for anyone who proves that there was any kind of "agreement" stands.

Thanks for your comment. I store my BTC in offline-generated paper wallets. The seller, however, demanded that I used a new address, and those coins were meant to buy stuff at Amazon for some friends (using purse.io), after telling them wonderful things bitcoin can do. 
I would just get those BTC and send them right away to purse.io. I didn´t even have that money available right now, I haven´t been paid yet for most of my work since January.

Well...Bitstamp was created by "kids", and guess what happened. 
Foxbit has two "kids" who have a fantastic reputation, nice attitude and they work incredibly hard (some people in the brazilian bitcoin community call them "bots"). The partnership with Blinktrade sets the bar way higher in security terms compared to other brazilian exchanges. 
There are over 12,000 members on the Facebook´s group, and newbies always pop up, enthusiasts grow apparently from nowhere and even some trades take place. It deserves a lot of respect and bitcoin enthusiasts from other countries should have that warm feeling indeed. 
Rexbit (rexbit.com.br) is doing an amazing job in Aracaju, performing numerous "bitcoin for beginners" courses. Like it or not, bitcoin is gradually happening in Brazil. I guess you sir (or madam) should take a walk around to find those who view the world in the way you do. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:56:05
This is how a currency dies, son.
Don't expect every single fiat owner to be convinced about bitcoin's potential. Only ~10% will do so, and will "scam" the other 90% paying loans in a worthless Fiat currency.
Besides, one can always build a new house. When a bitcoin is bought, though, BTC - the currency - becomes more scarce, more valuable, spurring more demand, so a positive feedback loop kicks in.
He who panics first panics best.

@_date: 2017-10-27 03:33:40
I know in person. Nice guy, three children. He might have been sloppy, but considering the amount lost it is certainly worthy trying to get back those coins. 
It seems that both 16qNnkYPWHZiVHrM99YrRjzTWEUGFFAxY6 and 1NSc6zAdG2NGbjPLQwAjAuqjHSoq5KECT7 belong to exchanges. 
He has already contacted both Coinomi and Shapeshift, without a solution. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Today is the last day of an extended holiday in Brazil, so I guess the volume of the last 24h will be probably very low. March/15 was, however, the month when the fiat-volume of bitcoin exchanges reached an ATH (~ 6.5 million BRL, beating November/13, which was at 6million BRL). 
We used to see 150-200 BTC/day. I remember when I sent a facebook message to a friend celebrating the 250 BTC/24h mark. Now we can frequently see it above 300 BTC/day and I`ve already seen it around 400 BTC/24h. I talk to a lot of BTC investors here in Brazil and most (if not all) of them have reserved a stash of fiat to buy "as soon as the bear market ends."

I am afraid my fellow bitcoiners miss a point here. Bitcoin market is a complex system and, as such, subject to "butterfly effects". 
Given the appropriate circumstances, it is theoretically possible that the purchase of a single bitcoin drives the price a bit higher, enabling an arbritage deal, which then raises the price a few cents in a major exchange. A richer investor might see that as a motivation to buy larger sums, and the price goes up 2 or 3 dollars. This new rise stimulates the purchases from a couple of "over the fence" people and so on, and so on. 
We can never know for sure what it is the minimum sufficient dose to start a positive feedback loop at a given moment.

On the other hand, one should not jump to the conclusion that Brazil has played any important role regarding the recent spike. The price of bitcoin in Brazil has remained consistently below that observed in USD (Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase) exchanges. In Nov/13, the price per BTC reached ~ 1400 USD at MercadoBitcoin. Talking to people from the local community, the most plausible explanation seems to be large sellings from brazilian early adopters (yes, we have a couple of them, with a huge amount of coins).
The guys from FoxBit and Bitcointoyou are working hard, and the dwindling brazilian economy coupled with the terrible fiscal situation of federal government have generated some fear of leaving money in the banks. I talk regularly to people from those exchanges and they report that the number of pageviews and new users have kind of doubled in the last days/weeks. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 09:07:54
Usually it takes some time. People need to listen about it once, twice, five times then dedicate some hours to understand about wallets, security etc. 
If we had a BTC ETF/fund here, people who recognize its potential or otherwise just want to gamble a few bucks into it would be able to do so without being obliged to spend hours/days of learning the practical issues. I´ve helped a lot of people setting up offline paperwallets and sometimes going through the purchase process. In the last year with steeply declining prices bitcoin has been a tough sell though.

If the issue is only getting protection from inflation, one can buy dollar bills here. IMHO bitcoin might gain a broader public due to its capacity of crossing borders. More stringent capital controls for those trying to move their money abroad might boost BTC´s demand. I hope we don´t have to witness such catastrophe in order for adoption to increase.

Sorry, I was a bit sleepy yesterday and didn´t notice the word "regulatory." Bitcoin is legal in Brazil, there is even a guidance from our local IRS regarding how to fill your tax form informing your BTC transactions/holdings ( - how would they track it goes beyond my understanding though). 
Brazil´s Central Bank has issued a statement informing that it is "monitoring" cryptocurrencies and recognizes that specially due to their very low volume they offer almost no risk to the local financial system at this moment. Mentions volatility etc etc. Banks might seldom be afraid of providing accounts to bitcoin business or eventually ask a few questions fearing AML legal process, but most BTC startups here have a handful of bank accounts (quite better compared to the landscape in other countries I guess). 
We have no BTC fund/investment vehicle so far in Brazil. We have a payment processor startup (pagcoin.com.br) that is so far, IMHO, failing to spread BTC acceptance (EXTREMELY slow adhesion of clients). A couple of people offer eduactional resources (presential courses, translations to youtube videos etc).

I am not a professional journalist. I was not writing a scientific paper, so I didn't care to specify that the debt rose from 57% to 63%, that USDBRL went from 1.9 to 3.05 etc. It was a casual reddit post, can you live with that? 
I'm just a physician who happens to love bitcoin, and who was disappointed by an article regarding Flowbtc as revolutionary, or claiming that the lack of bitcoins was hindering its adoption.
When I talk about "old coins" I am referring to those held for a long time, kept in very large amounts by an extremely low number of early adopters. Given the current low demand for BTC, they could supply the brazilian market at relatively low prices for a long time (I keep contact with a couple of them).
So now you are trying to depict me, a diehard ancap, as anti-entrepreneurship, or anti-freedom of speech, or as a paid-shill? Good luck with that.

I guess that once bitcoin goes viral in Argentina, it would speed up its adoption in Brazil. Buenos Aires is a major touristic destination for brazilian middle class, and such a "new currency" would not go unnoticed.

It might be only wishful thinking or he might have been a little bit nervous, but it seemed to me that the regulator guy knew that one simply cannot "regulate" bitcoin. "Anti-money-laundering" is deemed to become obsolete as you can convert fiat to bitcoins and hide it anywhere, move it anywhere. 
What could government do? Attempt a 51% attack? Luckily they are moving too slow to realize the threat that bitcoin represents. When they try to fight it, they simply won;t be able to do so.

The article is inaccurate as it says that "bitcoins were in heavy circulation in Brazil last year". As a brazilian, active forum user, friend of many of the most bitcoin-involved people here, I can say that we might have (optimistically) 2,000 brazilians owning at least a fraction of a bitcoin at this very moment. 
It seems that Argentina will be the place in Latin America where BTC takes off first. Much higher inflation, tough capital controls and more educated people.

Banning the access of institutional chinese investors, creating significant barriers to the development of consumer-friendly ways of buying bitcoin and making bussinesses wary of accepting bitcoin (as it is regarded as "not-a-currency" and a "money-laundering vehicle") is certainly not good news. 
I guess this statement marks the beginning of the war Bitcoin vs Governments. I am certain bitcoin will win. I have no idea how many years (generations?) though it may take.

Brazilian bitcoin holder and enthusiast here. 
Things seem to be priming for a takeoff. Larger meetups are being held or scheduled, regular appearances at tech specialized media, two structured exchanges (and a smaller third) operating. One of the owners of those exchanges was asked from a possible buyer whether he could buy 10,000 BRL (roughly 5,000 USD) daily (yes, daily). 
A lot of bitcoins change hands daily powered by facebook and bitcointalk forums, off the exchange´s charts.
Talking about my surroundings: at least 5-10 friends are just waiting for being taught about the operational details to put some money (we´ll have a reunion with probably &gt; 10 people, in Brazil´s 3rd largest town, next week; a few stock market small investors were also invited). Another friend told me that a major business (undisclosed activity) chain (&gt;100 stores) is about to start accepting bitcoins. I have another friend who is a soccer player and, once he starts dealing with bitcoins, he told he might spread the word to other players (who pay heavy taxes in remittances, moving frequently from one country to the other). That fact will probably spur media coverage (I have this already pre-settled).
Some savvy people are using bitcoins already to escape from taxation and divorce confiscation. We have a very small, but extremely enthusiast community, which seems to grow every day. It seems a matter of time.

Unfortunately I have to disagree. It seems simple, but it ends with complications. Recently I had two checks returned when I was transferring funds from accounts in different banks (although BOTH were MINE) by using a check. 
Reasons: incorrect signature (cannot realize what I did wrong) and did not write the name of the city I was in. 
Imagine the effect of that if it were a huge deal, involving my reputation etc

Actually it appeared on Globonews, a news channel that belongs to the Globo Network, but is available only through cable TV (muuuuch smaller audience).

The tone of the press release is overwhelmingly negative. It seems we might expect a "China" approach to bitcoin after a few months in India.

To the English readers: the law is attached to an agricultural one (it is common in Brazil to have completely distinct subjects addressed by the same law). 
Summary: the government wants to stimulate the "financial inclusion" (aka: a way to collect more taxes) of the 
population by allowing payment through mobile devices. 
Telecom companies won't be allowed to offer so-called banking services (loans and investments).

I am afraid that speculators actually *decrease* the volatility of the price of any commodity. Read link below:

It would be very fun to have "pseudo-worker" at certain gov't bureaus moving to become much-needed waiters and clerks elsewhere. It would be fun to obligate the gov't to cut the expenses on weapons and bringing many troops back home. Many new businesses, it would (will) be awesome!

Hi, sgornik! We keep the group closed so that people won´t get embarressed exposing their views on money or political preferences to relatives, employers or neighbours (that´s a problem with facebook). Feel free to join the group! The plan is to have monthly meetups!

Hi, cognatus! Try bitcointoyou.com or the forum bitcointalk.org, Portuguese section. Even though I myself do not sell coins, look me up as duduqa there so that I can give you some tips.

Congratulations, you have just caught a glimpse of the potential value of one bitcoin in the near future.

Brazilian real is devaluating kind of fast (USD rose 10% in a few weeks), and government is craping their pants before raising interest rates, fearing it might burst a real estate bubble (real estate market here has gone mad since 2008). They won´t give up their high taxes on imported goods, as it would hurt their fellow crony capitalists. Dead end for PT (Partido dos Trabalhadores - *Workers´ Party*.

I agree with almost everything, but I must say that bitcoin is not only also about the price, but fundamentally about the price. Bitcoin's hard limit of 21 million units limits the otherwise unstoppable and reckless money "printing" that debases each and every fiat currency and simply steals wealth from all the people.

I know the "Lamassu" word relates to the Babylonian deity, but as a portuguese native speaker I'd like to ask: is the company's name pronounced like "lame as you"?

Hi, fellow! I wrote about this topic in the comment above. Accepting bitcoin in Brazil, as in most countries, *might* be legal or not depending on a number of factors. I am not willing to take this risk at this time, due to a few individual issues. 
My specialty (endocrinology) involves little to no third-party payers, so I could accept bitcoins once I am a little more sure I won´t get into serious trouble.

At ~ 6%/year, inflation is not a priority on the mind of the average middle class investor (consider we had 30%/month in the early 90s). Most of those who buy at this moment are libertarians, but there are poker-players, IT people who recognize the technical advance it represents when compared to government money, dota players etc.
We are working to spread the word, at least from an investment perspective.

The OP sees wealth as a zero-sum game. Bitcoin helps the creation of wealth and prosperity, even to the late adopters, although to a much greater benefit to thos who get in the bit-train earlier.

You have just convinced me, Sir! Back to business!

I thought a lot about it, and technically it would be quite simple. I have to confess that I fear from an individual point-of-view, since many of my patients are top-tier law enforcers, and bringing that kind of government attention to myself would not be in my best interest at this very moment. I am sorry. 
Maybe in a few years I will adopt a more evangelist attitude.

Has anybody ever considered the idea that Satoshi Nakamoto might me an employee ate NSA? That would explain his wary attitude towards government and the decision not to come public.
