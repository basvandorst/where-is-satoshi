This is one of the main parts about bitcoin that makes me think it will go far. The ability to provide banking systems and financial security to the entire world, can't wait to see what happens.

Not to mention bitcoin allows for first world banking abilities in 3rd world countries.
As long as they have access to an internet connection.

It's gonna be a scramble (if it isn't already) to get control of the global banking market. Only way to do that is start early and build a strong brand. There is trillions to be made.

Ehh Western developed countries generally have good banking standards that are strictly adhered to. The biggest use for bitcoins right now is disassociating your personal wealth from the banks/government and their national currency, something we don't really need to do. It's the people in countries with a rampant government and no other options that are going to be the driving force in bitcoin for a long time (in my opinion).

What are the chances I'm going to fuck up and lose all my bitcoins with this device? I probably won't be using my bitcoin to pay for stuff, just holding.

Just be prepared for the price to drop and keep your hands on your dick and away from the sell button when it does.

I believe in the idea of cryptocurrency rather than bitcoin itself, it's just bitcoin is leading the charge right now.
