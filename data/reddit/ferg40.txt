Glad I only bought like $80 at 4300. I wanted a nice round number at the time. Lol. I wouldn't sell man I have 4.6 bitcoin riding right now that I bought at 2100. Feels shitty considering, but we'll make it through. You got this buddy.

Lol ok, bad choice of words. It was just one of her points. Let's try not to attack right away. I know that's hard at times. Ha ha

Very good question, I also would like to know this.

It's more the fact that bitcoin doesn't have any physical backing. She understands economics, I'm not trying to say she's an idiot, just that she doesn't see any real value in it.
I understand her feelings about the backing though, gold has a physical product, the US dollar has government backing, oil has value. I get her feelings.

Lol yes, she does. Should I pump some wine into her and buy when she's drunk? Ha ha ha ha 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:05:25
Agreed. Man card unknown...

Wow dick head, it's also her money, and I'm done the considerate thing and wanting to talk to her about something that would fuck with both of or money. My balls are fine, I just respect what my wife thinks.
