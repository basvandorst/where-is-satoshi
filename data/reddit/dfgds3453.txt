 might be able to help.. otherwise you can wire the money back out of the US to somewhere like  who do support corporate accounts.  is a US bitcoin exchange that offers "institutional" accounts (ie, business) but they don't actually have a US bank account so you still have to wire offshore. Gemini does not support indians, so make sure you register as your US company.. they will probably still want your Indian ID etc as part of the KYC, but the account would need to be in the company name in either case.
There actually aren't that many bitcoin exchanges with US bank accounts.. coinbase and circle are both highly geared up towards servicing people rather than companies.
If there's anyone you trust in the US who can buy it using their personal account I'd probably try and get them to do it. If you don't know anyone, someone on  will do it, for a price.

not really.. the only way to buy instantly would be by CC.. there are other sites that take CC,      and maybe some others.. but none of them have fees that are particularly attractive..
actually cash might work better in some instances.. maybe try  ?

That's why it's important to stress that you are not an Indian, but a US company. The fact that one of the company's directors lives in India shouldn't matter.
