This sure seems optimistic

the same way I read it

What is NEO-BEE?

Well, good luck with that

Im sure there'd be a way to encrypt the messages to that only the recipient (the person owning the receive address) can read it.

It would be quite ironic if he were looking for a third-party to verify his legitimacy.

What I meant was that the encryption wouldn't be optional. Every message would be encrypted into the blockchain so that only the recipient would ever see it.
I have no idea how this would be implemented as I am not exactly a cryptographic genius. but I'm sure there would be a way.

Thanks for bringing this to people's attention! 
I've been using FileZilla for years and am more than happy to donate and BTC makes it a very simple thing to do.

Good for them!
Coinjar is what I used to invest my small amount into BTC so I could start a wallet. I don't have much, but without them I wouldn't have any at all.
Hopefully this funding leads to an even more refined / streamlined product and it lowers the current [knowledge] barriers to entry so that even more people can get involved.

I really hope so. I put in $500 a week ago and was sad that it only bought me 0.533 BTC, now that price isn't looking so bad.
I still just want to own *one*.

I did this exact same thing today (before seeing this thread) and got the same response. 
A large volume of people sending emails about it will probably/hopefully get them to consider it more strongly.

I signed up a few hours ago, which I believe was before the deadline but since there's no timestamp on the edit and I'm not in an American timezone I have no idea. I'll just assume I'm part of the list backlog.
The browser seems like a pretty interesting concept. Chromium seems like a good choice too.
I wish you guys the best of luck with it and feel free to continue posting updates as the development continues!

You can still drop the word Bitcoin a whole bunch of times while talking about something similar where the GPU mining would actually work.

I thought this was interesting until I realised the article didn't actually go anywhere or reach any sort of point.
If they marketed this at Litecoin miners that would make more sense since you're not going to get anywhere with graphics cards when mining Bitcoin these days. 
They even said ASICs can be 'up to 100x faster than a single graphics card' and then they go on to say 'use 6 graphics cards!' ...what?

It's spreading within pop culture, excellent
