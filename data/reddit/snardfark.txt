Oh my... This is... PERFECT!
@_date: 2014-07-22 18:12:21
I see now you put in 'Limit one discount per customer,' when it wasn't there before when I first made the purchase. I would have combined more items to get more of a discount had you made this point clear. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 01:51:15
Much better deal than Newegg gave USA customers.
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:50:19
Wait, people actually pay for porn? Thats bigger news to me.
@_date: 2014-08-28 21:18:01
CONSPIRACY: Someone will manipulate the market lower for Neweggs deal from 8/30 to 9/1.
Those are all Newegg's walls at $508.

You can't redeem it with video cards, at least not high end ones. I tried using it on a refurbished 780 gtx with no gift items and it still rejected it. 
edit: Tried it on a second card with no gift deal (PNY Gtx 780), same issue.

Well hopefully one of the alts can work out the anonymity thing eventually because bitcoin certainly isn't enough.
@_date: 2014-05-01 07:31:43
Spot on. I can imagine many people wanting to buy their first bitcoin will be turned off by biometrics, regardless of the stated reason for it. 
Bitcoin is about freedom. Biometrics is not about freedom. No thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:34:04
What profit and 'ROI' will you have if people lose confidence in bitcoin because of Ghash.io and the price tanks?
@_date: 2014-08-30 11:59:54
Yep. It's the main reason they add gift items, to block promo discounts.
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:26:58
Ah yes, the pinnacle of reasoning today. Those who think everything boils down to 'penis size.' 
The guy is right. 'Porn Professionals' is pretty ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:08:21
Picked up some $500 RAM for $350... awesome!
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:51:52
Your son could probably deal with you losing that money, what he would have a very hard time dealing with is the loss of his father. 
Please, hang on. Ride it out. No matter how bad you think it is, you'll never know if it could have gotten better if you aren't there to see it.
@_date: 2014-08-31 22:26:21
I was honestly surprised there wasn't a run up in price prior to the deal going live, but tbh after reading how frustrated people on other forums are (like slickdeals) trying to actually buy bitcoin in time for the deal, I'm pretty sure I understand.
There wasn't enough lead time from the announcement there was going to be a deal on Newegg.com. If there had been more time and better communication it would have given people more time to figure out how to purchase coins.
I know for a fact there are a lot of people who wanted to participate in the sale but had to wait days for coinbase to deliver bitcoin to their accounts. They just said screw it it's not worth the frustration.
So, I'm willing to be the sales are probably 70% "old" btc users, and 30% "new" btc users. IE, the majority of those buying already had owned bitcoin, and therefore didn't put upward pressure on the price trying to acquire bitcoin for the sale.
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:15:35
If I am not mistaken, the CoinJoin for DarkWallet uses one server, right? It's not decentralized?
edit: anyone know the answer to this?
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:46:45
I agree. Millibit is by far the best contender. Satoshis, no thanks. Bits... are you serious? Not sure what they are thinking. It's already taken and would be confusing. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 04:25:00
ALSO: Before you guys get pumped thinking you can buy absolutely anything with the discount, keep an eye out for 'gift items' they tack on to main items.
When they include 'gift items' you are not able to use promo codes. It's a tactic they use to prevent discounts from being used on certain items.
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:08:09
Blue, no question.
@_date: 2014-08-30 13:29:34
Was it being sold by a 3rd party on Newegg? If so you can't use the discount it's only for items sold directly by Newegg.
TIL: Newegg sells bikes. LOL! That's pretty sweet, never even thought to look.
@_date: 2014-05-02 00:48:50
'My concerns.' IE: freedom. Hahaha, you really are something else. When did you sell your soul and for how much?
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:16:25
I don't understand why people HAVE to know who he is? Know him by his work as that is how he wants to be known. If he wanted to be in the spotlight he would be, he doesn't. Why can't you respect that?
Regardless of whether or not this is him, the author of this article is an asshole.
Either she exposed someone who obviously didn't want to be exposed, or she just published the details of some random private citizen on a whim.
Total idiot.
@_date: 2014-05-11 03:49:40
With lies and copious amounts of money and favors. Corrupt politicians love to be pampered.
@_date: 2014-08-30 13:12:38
What were you trying to buy? I think some items have been excluded from the deal, I don't think this was mentioned prior.
Namely: High end GPUS and any items with bonus gifts.
@_date: 2014-05-28 10:25:49
I actually am interested in purchasing venus fly trap seeds, any idea on when they will be back in stock?
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:35:18
And that's fucking pathetic. Too many people are pushovers willing to bend to everything for personal gain, or because they are too weak to speak up.
I'd rather be accused of being 'myopic' while supporting freedom, than give in to everything for the sake of personal gain.
Also, there's a difference between not knowing about things, and knowing about things but rejecting them.
Myopia is having such narrow vision that you discard all other possibilities save the ones directly in front of you. I have broad vision. I am fully aware of the potential of bitcoin, that people use it for different reasons, and that a bitcoin ATM is likely a useful thing, I just wholly reject the idea that biometrics are needed. That's not myopia. It's not a question of ignorance, it's a question of principle. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:55:07
So, if you don't care. Can you please send me your last bank statement I'd like to examine it to see what you buy? 
Also, I'd like to see how much you have in your bank to see if you're worth knowing or trying to sell something to.
Also, I want to know your spending habits. When do you spend money? How much do you spend?
Also, who do you send money to and how much do you send? Do you send money to family members? Would they be OK with me looking at their bank statements as well? 
You have nothing to hide right? Do you support any groups the government doesn't like?
Do you have bad credit? Did you ever miss any credit card payments? Have you defaulted on any loans? What do you own? 
Did you purchase a house or rent an apartment? 
What kind of food do you buy at the grocery store? What kind of stores do you go to? How much have you spent on porn in the past year?
Would you be OK with having me examine all of your financial transactions in detail and cataloging them for future reference?
See my point?
Unless you want every aspect of your life available for dissection and analysis, you can see why privacy is necessary. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 03:20:07
I meant newegg obviously... rofl
@_date: 2014-01-23 20:47:18
Ugh.. when are the gpu prices going to drop, I want to buy a gaming card this is getting irritating. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:05:52
Absolutely, for this reason I won't use them. I am extremely wary of having to give even a picture of my license to a website. 
Social Security Number? Absolutely not. 
I was considering buying a few btc on gox, but honestly its too much trouble to bother.
@_date: 2014-05-04 04:33:21
How is saying 'great job' being an asshole? Just curious.
@_date: 2014-05-01 07:24:30
There's a difference between providing a photo ID and submitting to a palm, finger, or retinal scan. I will never use a Bitcoin ATM (or any other machine) that requires biometrics regardless of the reason given.
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:08:18
If you don't have anonymity and things can be traced you don't have privacy. It's pretty simple.
@_date: 2014-05-06 15:45:47
Not sure if there is anything graceful about a kneecap to the forehead and permanent brain damage, but... yeah.
@_date: 2014-07-26 02:11:28
Well damn this does sound pretty serious. A strike against coinbase, I'm going to reconsider using them... creepy.
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:34:09
If that's the case I'll never use a bitcoin ATM. Sad, because it shouldn't be like that.
@_date: 2014-05-04 04:37:25
Rofl... I see... 
@_date: 2014-05-06 15:46:41
As if being intelligent makes you exempt from being brutal.
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:37:36
Considering this offer expires on July 22nd, will Newegg consider offering it again thereafter?
@_date: 2014-08-28 04:22:34
It's one per customer. And it said something about limited funds.
On top of that, that would just be bad form. Please don't do that.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:33:03
Oh ok cool, thought you discontinued them or something phew... I'll pick one up then, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:57:26
What really worries me is that people might not appreciate the decentralized aspect of Bitcoin. 
Even now you have people flowing into the market simply because they saw stories about people getting rich, I doubt many of them even understand the technical beauty of the protocol and how financially liberating it is.
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:18:38
Pretty cool that they accept bitcoin, but a $4.99 'Activation Fee' for a $20 gift card ticked me off... I think I'll pass for now.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:29:50
Anyone know what happened to their $750+ gift cards? All I see now is up to $500... 
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:10:03
I really think this is probably going to lead to a fork in bitcoin... if not the rise of a truly anonymous crypto.
