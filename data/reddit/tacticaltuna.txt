Look at it yourself. We're gaining traction, but as a whole the market is very unsaturated. As such, big players can temporarily move the price. But when you switch into a large perspective we haven't had a down trend and are still seeing growth of the network. 
As more and more people join, the volatility will go away and we will see the true value. Looking at the log graph lets us view the whole as opposed to the now.

If you're expecting a crash, sell now and buy back if you want. If you aren't, then you can hold.
Or hell, you're doing pretty well, you can just sell and never look back.

Sort of but no, not really. Explaining these concepts aren't something one can easily do over Reddit. You're best to look into some of the preexisting sources if you want to learn more.
If people are relegated to providing you with a surmised version, ultimately it will just hurt your knowledge of Bitcoins. Start on the Bitcoin wiki, it has a good deal of information and work from there.
Since the system is P2P it makes no difference in terms of *trust* if there is one block being sent out at once or 100, besides the obvious bandwidth and scalabilty issues, the valid ones would always pass and the invalid ones would be dropped.
But as a currency, if everyone could create millions and millions of Bitcoins we would all in theory have an unlimited amount, this does two things: creates huge values to trade with on a daily basis, complicating transactions and lowers the value to the point that each individual Bitcoin hold little or no value, because you can just make another.

I'm not sure you understand,
It works like this. So for example if the going price is 190 as it was. If I had a large stock I could:
A) Ask for 190 which would dip the market slightly, but overall it would stay the same
B) Sell them at a $10 loss per BTC, causing people to see a dip in price. While this upfront "costs me money", it leads to people selling in a frenzy as they perceive the price is dropping. 
From there the person is able to buy more BTC when the market plateaus again at a cheaper price, before it goes back up. In this case if the value rises above 190 again they would be at a 10$ gain per BTC.
Hope this helped.

The system doesn't, the people do. Transactions are processed in the blocks. The blocks are processed by the miners.
In theory, if everyone paid the same fee (even if it was 0) every transaction would be processed at the same speed.
Miners can set the limit that they pick up transactions. Which in itself creates the need both for a fee and why some are faster than others.
Let's say there is 100 miners. Of that 100, let's say 10 are very generous and pickup any and all payments. The remaining 90 only process transactions with a fee above 0.000005BTC. 
When a transaction comes in with a fee, there is a total of 100 miners to crunch away and process it. However if a transaction came in without one, only 10 miners are helping.
So, since miners generate the transaction fees that is there incentive to mine them, which means that both the miner and the user have to decide fluidly what they deem a fair fee. If a miner is stuck with his fee to high, his income drops. 
Hopefully this clears some stuff up. Although I'm quite tired and perhaps it just came out like gloop.
Let me know and I can try better if need be.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:14:50
All of the above?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:15:01
I'm not sure we're on the same page.
Here's a better example using fiat currencies for simplicity.
Two parties eat at the same restaurant every Friday. The one is known to be a very generous tipper, the other usually leaves none. Which gets more service?
As time increases, if the one party were to continue leaving the same tip, he is going to be rewarded with faster service, but since fiat in deflationary in order to provide the same tip he must continue adding more and more.
The same is true with BTC. As time goes by and value increases, he will still want to tip the same: so he will reduce the value as time goes on. In both examples he tips the same "value" but the actual amount moves.
In this fashion, no matte the actual value of the tip, every individual party will over time adjust their fee.

Where do you live? I mean depending on geographical location you could probably meet up with someone on reddit that is willing to help.
Or depending how easily you trust others send it in the mail.
Personally I'm an IT professional with some background in data retrieval. I'd be willing to help, so I'm sure others are as well.
Question being, can you trust them.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:37:44
The fees are added to the block *after* it is found. Unless you were operating a pool or mining solo you wouldn't see the options, because of this.
Larger fees take more computational power to process and there is less of them. A mining pool or solo miner is trying to maximize revenue so they are attempting to maximize profits, which usually means taking the easier bounties.
You are right in that a transaction will not get added to the block until a miner who has found one decides to include it. This is why lower fees sometimes sit for a while, eventually however they will get picked up because someone is willing to process them.

CGminer is slightly faster than pobclm (guiminers default). That said you can setup Guiminer to use CGminer.

Basically: though they said they would take a  good deal of what you spend on the mars and put it towards the Jupiter as well as giving you the same order spot if you buy a mars. 
I have the exact amount they said in an email at home, but I'm at work. If I recall it ended up being something like ~750 for  the Mars if you order the Jupiter as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:55:00
That depends a lot on the card.. On my 7970 rigs I get an extra 30-40mh/s on Cgminer over pobclm.

Which is exactly what I did. I only provisioned a brief synopses of the financial gains and risks to the corporation, I did nothing to insinuate that I was attempting to force the use on them nor that I was giving them a full breakdown of risk and reward structure. Clearly, that is something they would have to do internally if they were interested.
If you actually took the time to read what I had outlined you would both be able to come to that conclusion on your own and additionally realize that I suggested they do the adequate research themselves. 
Simply spamming an "I WANT THIS AND I WANT IT NOW" as the OP was suggesting is not the better option and only someone with very little knowledge of the functioning of mature human beings would understand that.
I don't intend to come off as hostile, although I'm sure it will read that way. Unfortunately, I think we're at a crossroads and fighting the issue back and forth further would lead us no where.

The Mars isn't an ASIC unit, hence the discrepancies. It's basically just being released as an in between while they get production of the Jupiter rolling.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:20:17
ASIC's aren't a new concept, they are used everywhere in the world currently. They are simply applying them to Mining. They are faster then general hardware because they are chips designed to do one thing: hash. Personal computing hardware needs to be able to do a bunch of different instructions, whereas they only have one.
Because of this hyper specialization they excel. Towards if BFL is a scam, likely no. They have shipped working FPGA's in the past: whether they ship soon, who knows.

In Bitcoin-qt one of the tabs says Receive bitcoins. Select that, you can then create a new address, or use an existing one.
You can have an unlimited amount of address per wallet, so it makes sense to split them up with sensible names.
Create one, Mining pool or the like, then copy the address that is given. It should be a rather long hash.
Provide said hash to your mining pool and when they send bitcoins you will receive them in your wallet.
If you mine solo, just provide your wallet to the client.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:41:46
Giving a static value (50) to each coin would be the definition of backed by fiat..
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:50:50
It's divisible.. That's like saying the dollar isn't usable because I could only ever spend a million at a time.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:11:24
Having a locally saved wallet is certainly ideal, assuming you can keep it safe. I would probably start with Bitcoin-QT as it is the base and very easy to work with. Basically just start it up, let it sync. It will create a wallet for you, which you can chose to encrypt or not. 
The actual wallet size is quite small and there is no reason to backup or encrypt the blockchain itself, which is rather sizable. That said, if you choose, and it is suggested: backup your wallet and encrypt, store a paper copy, whatever. Just make sure it is safe.
Towards transactions, you can. They aren't required, although since it requires a miner to pick up the transaction to be processed, it is desirable. Simply put, adding transactions decreases the time it takes to process. While it will eventually go through, it will take longer without a fee. Fee's are set by the user and the miner. The miner sets their limit to process and you set the fee you want to pay. If they line up, it gets processed, if not it waits.
Anything else I can help with or that you're still confused on?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:53:08
It works fine under Wine and their isn't a large enough player base to support the effort.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:41:43
Hash rate is irrelevant to the pool, they are just provided so the miner knows how they are doing. 
The pool cares about shares, it provides the work to the miner, the miner solves this, and returns his share. If the miner solved a different share and submitted it would simply be rejected.
So while in theory you could spoof your hash rate, it serves literally no benefit. 
Hope that clears things up :)

Alternatively, instead of sending an email that makes the community sound like a bunch of privileged children we could take the time to articulate a well versed and proper proposition for the company..
Subject: Alternate Payment Inquiry,
To Whom It May Concern,
Riot, I am a long time player and avid supporter. A loyal customer who has, with consistency purchased RP for the use of both furthering the company as a whole and providing myself with some enjoyment. 
It is towards this purpose that I am taking the time to contact you today. Through the current payment options, it is easy to deduce that you are both supportive and open to alternate payment formats. I am reaching out regarding the use of Bitcoins.
While currently it is rather volatile, the use of Bitcoin as an alternate currency has been proven sound time and time again. It is quick, secure, and has very little overhead. 
If moving forward you could take the effort required to research the currency you will be very interested and we as a community would greatly enjoy the opportunity to continue to support your company with our payment method of choice. Accepting the digital currency will both act to bolster sales and retain customers: through the removal of transaction fees and avoiding third party services and credit cards. It allows users of all ages and backgrounds to make purchases and overall is just a wonderful form of currency.
Hoping to hear something,
Insert name here.

Computationally it scales such that since there is more data to process, the longer it takes, naturally: A computer or cluster is still only able to process so much data in one time.
Since the median is always moving, although set by an unspoken agreement between miners and users, naturally also transactions fees outside of the norm will either be quicker or slower.
Setting	 Default Value (units)
paytxfee	 0.0005 (BTC)
limitfreerelay	 15 (thousand bytes per minute)
mintxfee	 0.0005 (BTC)
blockmaxsize	 250000 (bytes)
blockminsize	 0 (bytes)
blockprioritysize	 27000 (bytes)
Are the particular lines that you would be interested in mining config.
Where priority is calculated as such:
priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes

Since I can't think of anyway to say this without being a douche.. shouldn't you already understand that if you intend to code or even outsource your own?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:14:05
Unfortunately, no. Since transactions are processed on to the block after it has been solved the miner would have to actually generate a block first.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:09:16
You set your transaction fee, if the value becomes too large, lower yours. This in turn forces miners to lower their pickup rate and eventually it just shifts.

Continuing off Narmotur's point, depending on what wallet you use, you may be able to just pass out an unused address in your wallet, instead of the wallet itself. Then if/when someone cracks it they would only have access to that particular address, if you happen to have an extra empty address in the lost wallet.
