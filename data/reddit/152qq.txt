OK, throwaway for obvious reasons. My Bitcoin story:
I came across Bitcoin at the end of 2009, just when I came back from failed PhD studies abroad (had to change the project 2 years in) with severe depression and lifelong suicidal tendencies. Had some savings in my account, nothing major, but started considering buying BTC. Problem was that I was unable to see any future for myself (even though I was in good health and in a relationship), though unemployed and depressed. Ended up using the money to have a celebration for my marriage and burned through the rest of the savings until some freelancing gigs started paying of. At some point suicidal drive became too strong, and while wife was out of the  country on a business trip, I sat drunk in a shower with a knife, contemplating the details of how to convincingly invite my friend, so that he would come over in the morning and discover my body (didn't want my wife to go through that ordeal). But something snapped. I put the knife down and went to bed. Turns out wife got prego a week before. So we had a daughter. I started teaching in uni and once our finances stabilized a little bit, that we didn't have to live paycheck to paycheck, I started buying BTC. I started buying last summer. Ended up with a little over 1 BTC. If I compare this one BTC with couple of thousands that I might have bought back in 2009, I might feel depressed, but on the other hand, know that I have escaped depression with my life (probably would have killed myself if I were alone, even with thousands of BTC), and still managed to get some BTC, before its price got out of my range. My base salary in university as a lecturer is ~600eu, so it's not that I can afford 10k coins any time soon. But on the other hand, for me there is no huge difference between 100M or more in fiat - I will hodl and this one BTC will become the bedrock of my future generations to come :)
