I would like to point out, that while their attitude is not appropriate in the slightest imo, unless you have a court order that she owes you the money, as far as the CU is concerned, they're right, right now it **is** technically her money and they have no legal reason to give it to you. 
Mind you, I don't think they should withhold the funds from her at all, and what she does with them after she gets them in cash is none of their business, but if your attitude became from their perspective a 'give me my money', they're right to tell you it's not your money at the moment.

Yeah, OP definitely should not have had to pay more than once. At the risk of this coming across as 'DAE hate cops lolol', I find it hard to believe the police really decided that OP was on the hook at all, assuming truth in all OP has said, this is akin to exactly like you said, sending money to the wrong account, but at the manager's instruction.

I was under the impression you needed to opt in for it, and it would then remove the visual ads and you'd mine instead, when visiting that webpage in the future (via cookies to remember your choice later regardless of any account or subscription)

Thus, as with most of these kinds of cases: 'it depends'. 
I imagine he paid taxes properly, but I think I think too highly of people personally

You may want to change your post to be more accurate then. 


That being said, any CU that has had a previous problem with a potential source of business as well as unusual account activity is well within their rights to withhold the funds till they can be sure it's not fraudulent

If I had more faith in our current government I'd have thought it was worded that way to appease the ignorant masses, [since only Canadian currency is actually legal tender in Canada]( it's unlikely that anything else will be 'legal tender'.

Next steam summer sale: "buy this for a dollar or X hours mining credit"

Same address in this kind of thing is absolutely fine. Keeping it somewhere that someone could easily replace it is not fine. Laminate it and keep it either in the office where only manager can get it or have it generated on a computer screen (though the latter should remove any need to limit it to one address)

If only I had the means and knowhow. Maybe someone will get on this sort of thing
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:42:10
Yeah.... It's definitely only a US problem

Barring the obvious trolls, I've only seen that kind of attitude in response to questions like "how should I get started with mining blah blah blah". And only in the kind of "if you're wanting to actually invest money in this, buying them right now is the way to go"

Well no, but they'll never say it's cause you're black. They'll just terminate the business they have with you. For any reason includes the following: 'for no reason', 'I'm having a bad day and I randomly picked your account', 'my cat jumped on the keyboard and these numbers came up', 'you don't like the colour yellow', 'Jupiter exists', etc etc etc. 
That being said, I get what you're saying, banks need to not be blocking these sorts of transactions, but trying to get them to by trying to force them to allow it or trying to use a flimsy terms of service argument, the best way right now is probably just moving to another bank that *will* allow BTC related activity. Sure, one lost account won't make them blink, but 100? 10000? Eventually they'll start losing a noticeable amount of money and/or someone higher up will realise bitcoins aren't going anywhere
