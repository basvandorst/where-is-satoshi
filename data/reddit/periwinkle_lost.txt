Avast for antivirus no idea what sort of malware he had.

For all it's worth my friends PC with Ubuntu was compromised, even though he had antivirus and antimalware and all that. He kept his private keys in a text file thinking that Linux and antivirus gave him better protection than winPC.   
Someone posted last year that with crypto most of the malware moved from being a nuisance to keyloggers/Trojans because it means that hackers can hit a jackpot. An important thing to keep in mind is that antiviruses are playing catch-up with hackers

No replay protection is an ultimate “all-or-nothing” move. With time only one fork will survive. That’s the whole point, proponents of X2 are not forking like BCH did, they are attempting forceful change of BTC itself. I guess they have quite a bit of confidence in their creation.

Given the difference in price it should definitely be in the title, not the details

They will go back to drawing board, they obviously see a lot of benefit in obtaining control over the protocol. I doubt they will ever cease their attempts. Who knows, maybe something good will come out of this whole debacle.

This sub is a goldmine!!!!

This is exactly the thing most people should do.

Sub to both r/bitcoin and r/btc. People on both subs are very enthusiastic and to get a half-decent picture of the current situation I read both.

X2 was a ruse, they made their money and I’m pretty sure they’re coming up with another plan to increase their wealth. I don’t know why you want an apology, even if they did issue one it means nothing to people like them.

Why doesn't it have a feature of adding holdings at the market price?

I am sure that those guys make a lot of money. A lot of people want to get in but don’t research what bitcoin is. It is obviously a scam for crypto savvy people, but for a lot of people this seems like a decent deal.

I stopped trying to predict what’s going on. I’m just in for a ride
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:05:13
I just ordered mine too!!! So excited

My goal is not to get free btg. I just want to have a full control of my tokens.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:36:12
That's exactly what I am scared of

They asked for the same things in order to enable Interac. They’re doing this for the taxes
