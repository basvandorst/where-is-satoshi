Germany! The QR-code magic you describe sounds amazing, I wish I could use that sort of thing here.
The process Im going through here is:
- you have to register as a city-citizen
- you can either get an appt which is 4-6 weeks (Im waiting for this now) *or* you can just go and jump into a queue at the city office, but it'll take you 1-6 hours and I can't take a day off to do this
- then, once you have a piece of paper saying youre a citizen of the city, you can get a bank account, which usually takes 2-3 days. *Usually*.
- then you can apply for internet access which, according to some forum posts , is anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks.
I'm lucky as I already have a place to live and I got my friend to apply for internet service and I work remotely so I have it pretty easy, but I can't imagine moving here without those aces up my sleeve.
Now I really wanna see how life looks in  Korea!

I want to do this right now as well, but first I have to get a bank account in the place that I moved to and they need all sorts of papers, phone calls, and more papers.
So far: Getting wallet + btc = 3 days (mainly usd to btc exchange verification, I couldve done some freelancing to get btc faster tho)
Getting bank account in new country = 6+ weeks.
I love the feeling of having *trust* where I come from (bank account, credit history, etc.) but because I'm a new comer here, I'm looked at like a potential criminal and barred from having a bank account and thus internet access at home, non-prepaid phone (thank god for cash!), my own apartment, and lots of other things :)

Or how about trying to even get a bank account?
To open a bank account you need proof that you actually live under an address or meet some other criteria meant to block anyone from poor people to travelers from being part of society. Here (Germany), you need to register in the town/city where you live. The closest appointment spot they had open is in May. To get internet access, you need a bank account.
This means that after moving to Germany ~2 weeks ago, I still have a good 6-8 weeks of sitting around and waiting for the bureaucratic machine to turn its wheels and allow me to *purchase* some internet access for money I legally made.
I can imagine this whole process running off of a blockchain (trust, value) and taking ~5 minutes. Too bad we're not there yet.
