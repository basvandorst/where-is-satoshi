Shameless plug:
* [cryp2cash.com](
* [CryptoTrustPoint](
The latter is still a couple of weeks from primetime, but [cryp2cash]( is up and running!

Hate on, but my phone apps are my tablet apps are my laptop apps are my desktop apps.

We are totally thrilled and grateful to be out here in Sunnyvale and to participate in this AWESOME experience!

Oh ya, I can build my own apps - on my phone - and use them without the draconian review process.

Ya, when you put it that way I guess it does sound kinda scammy... Allow me to be more transparent:
We are 4 bitcoin guys who all live in San Antonio, TX.  We are out of Geekdom, which is a collaborative workspace that Graham Weston of Rackspace started for geeks and entrepreneurs to find each other.  Two of us are miners, one of us is military reserve, and the other partner is the CEO of Akimbo Financial, the prepaid VISA card we are using.
Being the reddit voyeur that I am, I had seen a lot of discussion around the multisig or MofN transactions.  Have NOT seen any reasonable implementations of it.  We decided to build a node to facilitate those transactions, effectively escrowing to the blockchain.  That is [CryptoTrustPoint.com]( our main project.  In the meantime, [cryp2cash.com]( can help with instant money for coin while we get the multisig project completed.
Hope this helps - I appreciate the feedback on how best to present ourselves, and what is right or wrong with our approach.

So far its been people we know, proof of concept.  It works.  It's manual, so it's a lot of work on the backend.  We are developing another site [CryptoTrustPoint.com](   that will not only automate, but escrow to the blockchain...

My understanding of what Ole Reggie is saying is more about [contracts](  Am I missing something here?

I happen to use purse.io for literally EVERYTHING I would normally buy on Amazon. Its super simple:  I create a wishlist, I post it on purse, I say how much of a discount I want, I send in that amount of btc, and post. Within a couple hours somebody fulfills my wishlist with $$ and receives my btc. I get my merchandise paid at a discounted rate in btc.  I am always amazed at A) how fast the order gets filled, B) Why someone would pay a premium for btc when they can buy it at market rate in a dozen different places on the internet, C) that I get my Amazon merchandise between 15 and 30% off.
Purse.io ROCKS!  These guys have filled a void. Where else would I/can I spend my btc?

Fuck Apple and fuck iOS. 
I have a blockchain wallet, a coinbase wallet, my paypal, other VISA cards, T-Mobile wallet, and more, all available to me to transact in whatever currency I want 24/7 - AND it is part of the OS on my...

[CryptoTrustPoint]( is building a true peer-to-peer exchange in the spirit of a decentralized Bitcoin.  Cheat-proof and trustless, and exactly as described earlier, escrowing to the blockchain...

Actually I was promoting an alternative to the mainstream
