That defeats the spirit of OP's question
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:36:44
then what is?
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:49:46
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:13:59
actually dollar for dollar these antminers on amazon are about the same, thanks though
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:07:19
Wow, this is really dumb llol
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:53:11
eastern oregon = hydroelectric = $.08/KWH
Thanks though, I've been shopping around and the first one you linked is a pretty good deal too 
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:09:44
IDK, that's a lot of risk for $4.5 million. If BTC were to drop to zero 6 months from now you would be on the streets. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:12:47
well a $400 miner at 180 gh will yeild $1k a year in profit at $400/BTC, so there's still a pretty good chance of turning a profit. part of me just wants to do it for fun though
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:35:55
so sick of butthurt bitcoin users hating on dogecoin
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:34:39
No, I mean ross. 
I feel really bad he got caught, but anyone denying he's DPR at this point is delusional. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:41:42
Yea, I'm sure that's why
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:46:11
Sounds like someone has been enlightened by their intelligence
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:33:43
Only on would that comment receive upvotes lol
but in honest answer to your question, because it allows people to borrow money
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:00:51
wow, that's fucked up. sell that shit and feed someone in africa for a year or some shit. fuck bitcoin and it's butthurt excuse for a community 
Edit: also the guy in this picture looks like some douche 23 year old that lives in his parents house, probably spends all his time day trading bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:58:52
everyone knows about tulipmania
not at all obscure
downvoting your post
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:08:09
or vice versa
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:11:11
Thanks, I just looked into Zinc and I think that's what I'm going to try using
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:07:26
really? a fortune 500 company decided to give the seats to it's investors and business partners rather than some random neckbeard off the internet?
@_date: 2014-04-05 07:01:53
I like how newegg is trying to kiss bitcoins ass and they don't even accept it yet. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:05:05
It's not what I think, go to college and learn about economics instead of getting your info from internet libertarians
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:32:24
Yea they were still paying commission to an illegal enterprise though, and people selling non illegal stuff were a small minority (pluto)
It sucks what happened to SR, but it was an illegal marketplace built/known for selling drugs on the internet, not the guy selling grilled cheese sandwiches 
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:54:34
^ butthurt 
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:17:31
these were located on the SR servers retard
weather or not they belonged to ross is irrelevant 
@_date: 2014-06-22 13:51:32
That's something... Now why is it at the top of google
@_date: 2014-03-23 05:51:03
Right but if the government doesn't have any power over money, then they won't have any power period, and I'm not sure many people think we would be entirely better off with no government. correct me if I'm wrong
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:34:56
I guess you'll have to decide for yourself when you take econ101 lol
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:07:53
yea seriously, i wouldn't probably even know what bitcoin is if it wasn't for SR
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:24:53
What's even the point in answering op's question if you're just going to convert out of BTC though and have someone else buy shit for you using fiat. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:11:24
That's not a better question, you would have to be a moron not to take that
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:05:04
Dude I've been using darknet markets for years, I've read gwerns research and done my own. 
Your 'the government/media is out to get us' attitude is retarded. you're probably a 14 year old 'anarchist' that wears a che guevara t shirt. grow up
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:57:53
This sub just went full retard
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:05:24
what's that mean?
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:30:57
Yea this is shitty logic, you still lost 3/5 of your investment
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:40:00
the circlejerk in 2014
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:02:54
The government controls the money supply, not private banks. the spending limit thing would be nice though
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:00:18
As of right now, we might see $250 it wont be
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:56:34
Warrens Buffet? I can't believe he hasn't done that yet
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:17:48
no he doesnt, or coinbase wouldn't exist 
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:40:37
why the fuck would you move from ghash.io if they're getting all the blocks? I just moved 2TH worth of asic to ghash and it's awesome. Come join the party everyone!
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:25:39
Yea I guess, but I still don't see why the sale of $18 mil should crash the price as hard as it is. I mean everyone knew the feds were going to auction off the BTC eventually.
Also is it confirmed that the feds have the private keys for ross's personal stash?
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:48:51
that's nothing compared to silkroad
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:13:14
lol yea I'm out
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:32:25
now dispensaries won't need to use bitcoin, because they will be able to create bank accounts
@_date: 2014-03-18 19:14:27
Well he's wrong, lol
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:59:00
you win, now go forth and measure your intelectual dick against someone elses over the internet haha
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:31:47
that's a pretty pessimistic outlook, kudos to you for staying anyways though...
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:21:48
I hate senseless waste/destruction, but the iphone shit was just as dumb, and was all over that
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:15:11
well I know where I'm going to be mining from now on
@_date: 2014-03-29 05:38:42
lol, yea
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:16:19
probably not unless they were to let you bid with bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:50:38
OK, since you're retarded I'm going to give you an easy to follow example
USD looses 3/5 of it's value, gallons of milk now cost $7
"It's not a loss so long as you don't spend it"

w/e decrease in value, usually theres some sort of explanation if the market moves more than 10%
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:40:40
