Thank you! Other things people just don't take into account when they dream of Butcoin as a new world currency;  
Once the supply of bitcoins dry up people's wages will begin to fall (just another aspect of deflation but still worth mentioning) and one thing we have truly learnt about wages in the past five years is that they don't fall easily (look at Spain for example).. The empirical evidence for "sticky wages" is building up fast and IF bitcoin became a de facto world currency tonight deflation would no wait until 2040 to hit. And even though you described the issues of deflation in you post I feel like /Butcoin still has no good grasp of the damaging effects it has.  
Another issue is the speed at which the bitcoins are spent, the slower the turn-over the poorer we will become. And it seems as if the system constructed around bitcoins  is not exactly a smooth one to say the least. Sure, technical innovation might help but you still come back to the issue of deflation holding back the turn over rate.  
There is no one backing up the value of bitcoins besides the belief that they have value. And currently you can't spend it on much more than illegal stuff on tor or other bitcoins so it's practical use is extremely limited. With USD for example you have the US government backing the currency and they will always accept it as payment.  
I don't know, it's late and I'm tired but the whole concept of bitcoins seems to be retarded if viewed in the context of a wide-spread currency. there is just no way. Maybe PayPal will find a better way..
