It’s weird, the HODLers seem to have evacuated the planet. It’s almost like eating crow killed them instantly

Where did all the HODLers go??

a few redditing bois who found a meme currency v. hundreds of thousands of economists and financial analysts. Who would win?
[Bitcoin Wasn’t a Bubble Until It Was](
"Some believers in blockchain’s vast potential agree and rue the gold-rush mentality. Others are in denial, characterizing the current rout as just another bump in the road for a transformative technology. They point to multiple parabolic peaks and valleys over the years and actually have—or rather had—a point.
A speculative craze isn’t defined by its frequency or even its amplitude, which makes defining a bubble tricky. When bitcoin had appreciated by more than 1 million percent, an expert in manias said it didn’t meet his criteria for a bubble. Months later, bitcoin finally ticked nearly all of his boxes."

If you legitimately think the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis was caused by bankers printing money for themselves, I don’t think we can have an honest conversation about this. You still didn’t cite anything

Actually it *was* greedy bankers but it wasn't printing money for themselves. They loaned to people at high risk of default based on the incorrect assumption that real estate value would continue to go up. When it didn't, and people had adjustable rate mortgages that increased hundreds of dollars on their monthly mortgage payment, they couldn't afford it. Nothing to do with printing money and everything to do with predatory loans. But it's important to get the details right. They matter.

You need citations for near-universally accepted facts? Have you ever heard of the Sagan Standard?
Just because I'm nice, I'll play your game

I've got literally thousands more. As many as you'd like to read.
Your turn. All I'm asking for is a veritable citation regarding this claim YOU made:

You should take an economics class at the local community college. I think it would clear a lot of your hazy conspiracy ramblings. Or maybe not, seems like you've got your mind made up about all this no matter what facts a person might present you. Got any peer reviewed or corroborating sources about your claims that bankers print themselves money that they get to keep but nobody else gets to know about?
