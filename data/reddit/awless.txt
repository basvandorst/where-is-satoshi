Calm down everyone. Just pointing out that most websites seen by most users will have it listed as bitcoin cash. No doubt only long term either bitcoin or bitcoin cash will survive. None of the forks owns copyright on the name bitcoin; the battle for the name looks lost. If bitcoin is superior then it will win.

I think my top is question is will bitcoin cash be able to be a payment system to challenge the likes of visa/mastercard?
I purchased another half bitcoin cash, and the confirmation time was 1 minute.

I checked on number of exchanges and sites like investing.com and they all call it bitcoin cash. why fight a battle already been lost?

As I understand it- BCH speeds up with high volume by reducing the complexity of the problem to be solved which leads to inflation- more coins mined quicker- so the unmined coins will diminish faster. My question is what happens when all the coins have been mined will BCH have to pay higher fees to incentive the miners to process blocks?

disclosure:I do have a fraction of a bitcoin and  a larger fraction of a bitcoin cash; but the bitcoin fraction is worth more.
I watched a few youtube videos. I thought bitcoin cash solved the speed and cost issues with bitcoin but when I did my first bitcoin cash transaction it took over 2.5 hours to first confirmation..i hoped it wud be minutes at most..so bit disappointed there. Appears all the coins are compromised in some way or other.
