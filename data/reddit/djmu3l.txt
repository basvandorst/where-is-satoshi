Exactly my thinking. Or at least to regulate it...

Yeah I was skeptical of the reports, even though being British we don't get Fox here, we're aware of their "style of reporting" haha.
Media spin could spell disaster for Bitcoin though, true or not.

LMFAO SON PLEASE
You’re the person who made the initial claim(s) **without sources** , the burden on proof is on you my friend! 
The things you said are what a small minority of people believe. It is not the accepted narrative, you’re challenging that and that requires you to show proof, so go ahead.
(PS Breitbart articles and Alex Jones videos don’t count)
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:45:16
I mean It was convincing enough for me that you actually think that as I’ve seen that argument before haha. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:47:14
Also interesting how now you’ve switched your narrative to *pakistani* men rather than *muslim*
Tell me again how this isn’t prejudice, racial demonisation and straight up denial.

I don’t need numbers, because you still haven’t provided me with your sources. You don’t just turn up to a bar and say “THE SKY IS RED” when everyone knows it isn’t and then demand people go outside to check it. 
I’m sorry to break it to you, but there is no muslim conspiracy, there is no “wave” of immigration - the people holding you down and oppressing you are your *government* and as soon as you get woke and realise that shit, the better the world will get.

Lmao nice try gammon. No where in my comment did I defend muslim child rapists. 
You keep telling yourself you’re on the right side of history by demonising a culture and religion to the point of outright fabricating “facts” about them. Disgusting.

You see the problem with all this is that I’ve *read* the Qur’an and it’s no different to to the bible or the Torah in terms of violent content and bizarre rules and regulations. So there’s no way you can use that as an excuse to demonise muslims because you’re basically demonising christians and jews too. We all know that modern practitioners of faith respect the modern world around them and especially in Western culture adhere to the rules of the countries they live in. 
And the problem with your “just google it” argument and the *very reason that I’m asking you for sources that prove your point* is because **I have googled all this stuff already** and found a lot of it to be false. 
So my point remains. If you can’t give me some solid evidence of what you’re claiming, I, and anyone else reading this post has no reason to believe you. Sorry.

The statistics you quoted on ‘muslims committing rape ‘ are wildly incorrect. 
WILDLY. 
Like, I’d advise you to go to a doctor very soon because that level of insanity is very worrying. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:14:27
Again man, I’m gonna need sources for all of this stuff, I grew up amongst asians and muslims and none of what you’re saying is true from my experience.
You’re doing nothing but being the mouthpiece you accused me of being

Yes I’m sure once the actual neckbeard right wingers that enable neo-nazis and sexists get involved it’ll be open and inclusive to everyone 
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:06:50
What a compelling argument! Shit let me hang up my lefty boots YOU WON FAM
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:26:47
*doesn’t show their sources*
*demands I show my sources*
That ain’t how it works gammon lad
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:54:35
Open minded sure. Open minded to blatant sexism and unwarranted transphobia.
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:56:30
Lmfao you’re such a twat
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:35:10
Kick them out? Soooooo they can go and groom children in other countries?
So really what you’re saying is you don’t care about the raping and grooming of children, just about the type of person doing it.
I’ve seen some gammon in my time but this is just special

Big news this week as Quillam the statistics company that found those figures about “muslim grooming gangs” were actually found to be wildly biased against muslims and their statistics were meddled with. 
The reality is there’s no more muslim grooming gangs in the UK than there are christian, hindu or zoroastrian ones.

Looks nothing like a banksy other than its on a wall
