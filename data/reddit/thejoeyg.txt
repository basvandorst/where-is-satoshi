just add your paypal account to your accounts on coinbase and when you sell your coins you can transfer funds to paypal.

My FB feeds has been filled with ICO's and "Bitcoin Genius sells all of his bitcoin and says this is will be the new bitcoin". My feeds is literally full of ads for BS alt coins, I enjoy commenting on their ads though.

Glad you made money. I fully expect it to drop below 10K 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:38:33
I hope you took my advice 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:46:38
it is inevitable.  I remember how much blood was shed when the pot stocks collapsed. It was about the time every penny ticker was now in the MJ business. Exactly like all of these new alt coins popping up. Make a clean exit, or take a blood bath.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:15:21
No I made my exit yesterday morning before the bottom fell out.

You cant hodl for life. Realistically you have to use your coins at some point or there is no reason to have them other than to stare a account balance every day,,,which is measured in Fiat.

sold at 16,338 yesterday. Why watch all my gains disappear because its still currently up more then it was 3 months ago? I am looking for re entry around 7k if I see support and fee issue gets cleaned up. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:25:52
I sold at 16,338 yesterday. I may re enter when it dips below 7k. These next few days will be brutal.

you have to add your pay pal account to your coinbase account.

No future contacts are settled in the commodity you are trading. I am sure you are aware the when an oil or corn futures contract expire they do not ship you barrels of oil or bushels of corn. Supply, demand and sentiment toward oil futures contracts, which are traded heavily by speculators, play a dominant role in price determination.

I anyone taking into consideration that the first future contacts are getting ready to expire?  What would stop a group of wealthy investors pumping up the price, take out a short position on the futures market, exit BTC with their gains just before the expiration date gets here to drive down the price and make money on on the pump and the short?

I doubt they send bitcoin anymore, the fees alone would be as much if not more then the small amount they would pay in BTC.

"You're never actually going to see $500 bitcoins because the price can't go down to even early 2o17 prices again..." 
Ha! Never say never. I remember when it was trading 12's and 13's early in the year and I said wait for 7k mark. I was told "thats never going to happen". 
@_date: 2019-02-11 16:39:46


You are correct, at inception there were 0 coins mined, but I see you get my point.  But if you continue to divide isn't that the same as diluting a stock or printing more cash?
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:29:38
what do you mean? If a hard drive buried in the LA landfill has 300 coins on it...they are gone. correct?

Because we just print more currency to replace it.  Once all coins are mined, you cant replace lost coins..only divide the remaining. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 16:52:33
Is coinbase even solvent? I have read articles that insinuate that they do not have the coins to back the accounts.  
Also the "Bundle" purchase option just seems shady.  Who would accumulate coins like that? " **The Coinbase Bundle is a convenient way to buy the first 5 cryptocurrencies that were listed on Coinbase. You’ll get every currency at once, without having to buy them separately.**"

Minidisc vs Cd's
@_date: 2019-02-11 16:44:05
One more part I didnt think about is...this is assuming all coins have been mined by that time. Is ming the last coin even possible?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:15:49
No so fast, its 9,200 now. I believe there will be 7's, its just taking a little longer then I originally thought.

"It's payment for uncompromising belief in the face of risk. Hodling is your job and if you've been at it long enough, you've been paid well. Do your job."
This does not make any sense, How can you get "paid" if you never sell or use the coins?  Looking at a computer screen showing value to US dollar go up and then go down does not pay you. If by design bitcoin is going to replace fiat currency, hodling defeats the purpose. You have to use it for it to have actual value.
