Glad to see a hardware related post from 21. The software stuff is great too. I'm excited to see what new use cases people come up with as well 
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:44:13
There's no need of blockchain and you can do it without it. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:46:40
I think coinify.com wil do the thing.
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:59:11
Really great story, he made a great choice choosing bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:54:42
Well first celebrating for sure, then doing just the same.
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:50:35
Yes, time is running up and price will go up for sure. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:37:24
yes this video is timeless.
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:13:52
He is talking about different protocol, i think this is all irrelevant. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:38:18
Well on coinbase is over $500
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:53:36
If something go wrong with coinbase, you're in trouble and can do anything about it. With private keys you can make a few copies and make sure you never lost them and it's depends all on you. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 19:23:28
all4btc.com maybe this will help you. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 17:58:46
Cool. Everything in one place.
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:10:50
First two new features I was waiting for a long time. Thank you Bitsquare. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:05:53
Are you are running the latest version of MultiBit? Maybe that will resolve the problem. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:35:49
It's not netflix its HBO
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:06:46
O dude, you picked right. Bitcoin approves that. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:50:08
Use a newer version of you Bitcoin Core, sync, wait a while and everything will be fine. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:11:19
Where i can find part 1? thanks
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:42:42
Made a stunning thing and waste it. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:47:30
Use circle.com. Nice and secure service and will do you requests. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:56:49
It looks really nice. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:01:02
It's never too late with bitcoin, give it a try. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:20:52
Bringing better contract rights to the third world will help them immensely. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:04:07
If it don't exists then there is nothing you can do. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:09:12
I got the same thing. Thanks for sharing this and make people aware of it. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:43:03
Isn't that too much? I think it's about 20-25%
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:02:34
Great video, Cryptosteel nails it, no joke with this wallet. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:12:16
Interesting tough, but I don't think bitcoin will go that way. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:40:26
You have a point, history repeats itself, it's really likely to do it again. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:21:37
No problem at all, wait just a little bit. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:16:36
It was a real pleasure using MultiBit, I hope it will be more in future. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:55:20
Take you time, it's a better way to be surprised. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:08:42
Use their support, it will help.
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:36:23
Well it's going up and up... halving is near.
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:14:43
It's not available anymore, switch to Android and everything will be fine. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:00:08
They have nothing else to say so...
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:52:08
Contact the support, it's a weird thing that is happening to you. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:51:03
It's a great offer, only if i had 5 extra BTC. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:57:42
I love Circle, they do great job the day they founded. This is one of many reasons why I think they are the best. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:51:57
I think that ASICs are build to work only with bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:49:50
Well you have right, there's is no resistance in vacuum so if it work like supercomputer it could be faster for sure. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 17:10:57
Really creative idea, well done dude.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:49:03
Transactions are increased too much in these years so it a normal thing. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:38:45
Time is running up, be prepared. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:56:15
Well it will be my best day if it's true
