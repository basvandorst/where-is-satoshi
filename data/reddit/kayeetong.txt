Old news, fake title. It's mining pool centralization, not mining centralization. Any non-Chinese big players can move their mining pool outside of China. In fact, many Chinese miners moving outside of China. Suggest actually reading their original academic paper. Don't rely on fake titles/sensational clickbait.

And he is right, I have a friend who worked high up in CoinTerra miners in Austin, TX and they weren't very good quality which led to their bankruptcy. It's incredibly difficult to manufacture quality miners. Bitmain deserves their reputation, and is also funded by US fund Sequoia Capital, look at their official statement. So much FUD.

If you have a competent lawyer, you can create anonymous LLCs in Texas/Nevada for the purposes of anonymity and asset protection by holding property with the lawyer as registered agent instead of your own name. (Not legal advice, get a lawyer!)
It's commonly used for real estate property (landlords are sued a LOT), but I can't see why you can't have Bitcoin in it as it's generally considered property based on IRS guidance.
However, unless you are at fairly well off, it probably is not the right way for you to go about it. If you are worried about your social, just use driver's license. Coinbase takes DL.

Consider billionaires: Winklevoss, Tim Draper, Peter Thiel, Mark Cuban, Mike Novogratz, Richard Branson, Brian Armstrong... all invested Bitcoin directly. Do billionaires take calculated risks? Yes.

It's NOT a currency right now. It can be in the future. It's digital gold, NOT a stock. If you cannot make the distinction, I suggest you EDUCATE YOURSELF FIRST.
The reason why it's not a currency right now is because there are problems that can and likely will be fixed. For example, critics talk about the high transaction fees. What they don't talk about is SegWit and Lightning Network will cut those fees in the future to make it usable for small level transactions. Litecoin currently costs $0.2 per transaction and uses Lightning Network. You can see this for yourself on the public ledger called the blockchain and the code for Litecoin (which I might add was a spinoff from the original Bitcoin code). I've confronted the critics. They simply deny facts. So much for discussion.
If you truly want to learn, READ the article. 
It goes through the logic step-by-step about the velocity of money and how to valuate Bitcoin (estimated $250,000 to $800,000 "at equilibrium").
Here's my take: we can assume Hybrid Velocity = (% Token for HODL) x (V1) + (% Token for Medium of Transaction) x (V2)
We know V1=0 because HODL doesn't increase the velocity of money, and maybe 50% (exact number varies, I just use Coinbase's 2016 reported statistics) use as a transactional medium. The hybrid velocity was about 7 in 2016 and V2 is about 14. For perspective, the velocity of the USD M1 money stock is about 5.5. That's a higher velocity than USD.
Your perception of Bitcoin used only for a high risk investment is incorrect:

If we assume Bitcoin disrupts and replaces gold markets as "digital gold", yes.
Here's an institutional investor's (McK alumni) take on the matter:
$200,000-$800,000 is pretty likely if assumptions are met.

Maybe hackers need to figure out how to hack the banks so BTC goes to 1M :P
