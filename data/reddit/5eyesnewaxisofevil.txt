Apple, a ‘technology’ company that prides itself on ‘Thinking Different’ partnering with Goldman fucking Sachs.... what a joke. Been using their products since the goddam Mac classic and macOS 6 but now I’m waiting to dump all their products as soon as Linux can get its shit together and release something for mobile that is fully functional.

it seems they got fucked by some UK laws. Minimum transfer of 10,000 GBP was the last straw that probably made their volume go to poop

It’s not a myth, the US govt borrows from the federal reserve which it then lends out again. Something something fractional reserve system. Check out zeitgeist video on YouTube. It’s illuminating, skip the 9/11 stuff if it’s not your jam.

This is Segwit with backward compatibility. For example to use with exchanges that still haven’t upgraded to full segwit (bech32). You will still save on your transaction fees just not as much.

Just choose the fees with the column that has transactions today greater than unconfirmed. Adjust your fees accordingly in your wallet. 1-10sat will go through in about 30 mins.
