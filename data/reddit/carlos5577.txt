I have and made more money. I only keep some bitcoin to take advantages of opportunities (like bitcoin going up and altcoins having fire sells, same with fiat) since its the go to coin for noobs who get into the game. Sucks that noobs first experience with crypto is with bitcoin right now, that's really bad for the market as a whole. Bitcoin needs to fix its shit.

Until lightning comes out and bitcoin is useful, BTC ain't going nowhere but slowly down in this bear market.

Brand name is good and all but only works if the product is good enough. Bitcoin is nowhere near good enough, people switch to ether to transfer their funds now, that is retarded. If BTC can't fix their scaling issue than I see no future in it, I will be bullish on bitcoin when that happens.

So primitive that it is useless. Adapt or Die, bitcoin better get with the times fast and quick otherwise crypto will take a plunge and a new champion will arise from the ashes. I believe in crypto, not so much in Bitcoin because like all great technologies it can be replaced.

As for the bear's perspective... bitcoin is near useless until it gets updated god knows when.

I hate BCash because if your going to rip the name and the technology, you should at least do it right. BCash is just a band-aid to bitcoins scaling problems. I respect altcoins more because they actually call themselves something else and the ones that do well actually bring something new to the table. I wouldn't mind if a flippening happens with an altcoin someday which could very well happen to something that's ahead of its time and it's awesome.

You know. I can actually predict this, I just never put my money where my mouth is because trading and being wrong scares the shit out of me. It's all a pattern. just look at the yearly MACD, that shit was insane. It was when bitcoin struggled to get to new highs after 20k that was the signal. After bitcoin pumps and stays the same for a while people flock back to their favorite altcoins. After that the price of bitcoin goes down taking all the altcoins down with it. I just hope that this isn't the beginning of a long bear market like when bitcoin got stuck at $300-$400 and I also hope that bitcoin gets an update or gets the hell out of the way (screw bcash, just a freaking band-aid) because I don't like how new investors experience with it is slow and with high fees.

"Here's why my investment is right and yours is wrong even though we are all riding on the same hype boat..." post. Lol if you think people went back to BTC because of technological epiphanies. They only went back in to have their foot in the door and not be completely out seeing as how people seem to perceive bitcoin, like in this subreddit, to have any real value like the other altcoins. Lets face it and see the bears arguments in BTC vs Altcoins:
Will BTC ever update? It can't because otherwise it wouldn't be bitcoin anymore, therefore it will become obsolete, lightning network was implemented and didn't do shit to speed things up the way we need to speed things up because its just something built on top off obsolete tech. BTC would be unstoppable if there was a way for  people to agree on an update within the network but they didn't think that far ahead and satoshi himself said that a fork of bitcoin, aka altcoin, would replace bitcoin if it was ever needed. People buying altscoins are gambling on the fact that there will be something better and they are right, we just don't know what it will be, its a gamble.
Does BTC have privacy? Nope
Does BTC have easy accessibility? Nope
Is BTC effecient? lol nope
As for the market. The market will continue to go down until it goes sideways because unless BTC or any other altcoin can compete with visa on transactions than they are useless tech wise and fiat still beats them, so the hype will die down until we reach a point where people buy crypto for fun again instead of making money and that price to me is around 3-4k in BTC value, some people predict lower than I do just so that  it can reach 90% down but I believe in 80% downish. As for the altcoins, this is the time for which they prove which are truly shit and which ones have a chance to survive and the 10-15% that survive will come out stronger.

until you realize that bear markets lasts years. What was it again in 2014; 2 years right.
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:55:16
yeah but the safest bottom is when it goes sideways; ie when no one is making money. right now is all just traders trading on the downtrend.

They can kill fiat transfers to bitcoin. Unless people agree to do services for an x amount of bitcoin than yeah bitcoin can be killed off. Fiat is the only way to know how much bitcoin is worth right now.

besides gold actually being useful outside of speculation and investment this is a good list. I'm not concerned about energy consumption for bitcoin, I'm more concerned of being outdated in the near future.
