People said the exact same thing when I mentioned Uber to them in 2014.
I distinctly recall being called crazy for having a stranger from some unheard of phone app pick me up in his car and drive me somewhere.
Truth is, most existing Uber drivers drive Lyft also. This LibreTaxi app will just be another app the existing drivers use to keep customers flowing during their driving work day.
Nothing shady about it.

You can tell that smug customs agent to fuck off, you're not getting my password, and they will legally fucking steal $3,000 worth of equipment from you...like happened to me last year. 
...and oh yeah, accuse you of being a fucking pedophile while they are at it. You encrypt = PEDOPHILE!
Makes sense, right?
I now never carry any electronics through US customs other than my "travel" phone that has nothing on it except the Gallery containing volumes of random dick pictures...all shapes and sizes.

No, what I'm saying a society in which a guy that does shit like that and people allow it to happen is fucking bullshit.
You know, *actually doing something* that stands up for an innocent person rather than holding some retarded sign and "protesting"...i.e. wasting your fucking time
These Trump protesters don't give a fuck about social equality...they are participating in this shit for social media Likes and upvotes. The fucked part is, most of you don't even self-reflect enough to realize it.
You are precisely the same...and would just stand by and do nothing as an innocent person is attacked for no goddamn reason.
You are precisely what is wrong with American society. I can tell you've never lived in anything other than the "civilized" Western world...bc some of the other places in the world I've lived, the **men** aren't effeminate hipsters that would watch his female friend get assaulted and do nothing.
Honestly, fuck you and your kind.

The key word? CASH.
An ACH or wire from an exchange? Yeah, not cash. Thus, no reporting requirement.
Could still be reported via the SAR, if the bank's AML policy or compliance department decided to. But no, there is no BSA requirement to report this merely because it's over $10k.

This Bitcoin extortion thing is only going to grow.

Proving intent would be incredibly difficult absent a confession, although most of these cases result in confessions...or people not realizing it's a felony to try and avoid the report...so they just admit it unknowingly upon interview.

You could make roughly the same argument for someone reading Jihadi literature and watching beheading videos....but that's not illegal.
Child porn strikes the wrong (yet valid) nerve in people. We have a sex offender registry in the US....but why don't we have a violent offender registry? Is murder not as wrong as viewing child pornography? Is watching the video of the Japanese guy that ISIS beheaded a while back not victimizng him over and over again? What if someone derived sexual pleasure from merely observing such a thing? Would you criminalize that too?
Merely watching child porn is thought crime. Despicable as it may be, I don't think criminalizing mere observation of an act should be grounds for prosecution in a free society.
They make be sick fucks that need help....but I draw the line short of categorizing them as criminals.
@_date: 2016-11-13 02:02:08
You can if you are someone that looks at a picture of child pornography.
Thought crime *does* exist.
I'm not saying it's acceptable...but merely viewing and not creating? That's thought crime, like it or not.

Meanwhile....my gf and I shamelessly buy really fucked up sex toys and bondage shit at our local sex shop. People need to hide behind Bitcoin or anonymous Kindle downloads for something as tame as the book Fifty Shades of Gray? Pffft.
Try intentionally going through TSA with a carry-on full of ballgags, butt plugs, huge-wtf-sized dildos and some fucked looking bondage gear hoping to be subject to additional screening. It's fun making the TSA visibly uncomfortable and awkward with some of the stuff in our carry-ons.
Is that weird?
