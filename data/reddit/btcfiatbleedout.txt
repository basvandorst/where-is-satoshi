there is going to come a time where a  bearwhale wants to cash out 50000 or 100000 coins at once and doesnt give a shit about the future. it is either pay the man or admit there isnt enough money in the system and kill bitcoin by not being able to cover his sale. i dont think any of these exchanges hold enough fiat. there reserves are in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:32:25
lmao, i agree
@_date: 2016-08-13 10:14:17
i would wait and buy 5 coins @ $1000 each. Why? To get to that price there would have to have been a shitload of fiat pumped into the system. Like institutional money. And if institutional money doesnt get in bitcoin isnt going to the moon. Because all you will have is bagholders.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:43:33
ok, plain and simple, the pump was over and somebody was going to be holding some bags. so when there is going to be a dump it can always be explained by some event that happened or is happening. you had the halving, china miners, ethereum, the coders, hardforks etc any of these could have been used as a catalyst for a dump, but a hack on a major exchange is like icing on the cake. 
until there comes a time where the opportunity to buy back cheaper all the time disappears this will keep happening.
think about it, yes it sucks for the people who lost money in the hack but at the end of the day. but i thought the price should go up. 120k in coins are out of circulation. just saying, what if there was a cash buyer waiting off chain to buy the coins for cash? who would be the wiser. 1% less coins means more scarcity right?
@_date: 2016-08-21 20:54:49
buy now or cry later
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:31:19
nope. If I have bought 20000 bitcoins at $500. And the price goes to $900. A 20000k dump on bitstamp would take it down to $500 easily. I buy back with the profits i just made at $500 to $600 wait til it goes to $1000 crash the price back down again. Buy back lower continue. It may take time in between each pump, but until buyers can step in and stop every major dump this will continue for a long time.

too late to make any serious money. I bought my coins from ebay at the time. mt gox was shady as hell even before all the hacks etc. i wasn't wiring cash to japan to hope and pray it made it to my account. at that time people were thinking $100, NO ONE was saying $1000. so how much would you have invested? Can you prove all the early adopters sold? An early adopter who has 20000 coins can pretty much move these thinly traded markets at will. There is no one buying any substantial amounts, its all traders, bots and bagholders.

i first bought in in 2012 at $12 and i was too late. the only winners will be and are the early adopters. They control everything. No one will ever amass as many coins as them. They are too far ahead and institutions and wall street money know this. Big money isnt going to be at the mercy of some college geek who mined 100000 coins on their computer for free, let alone in the process make a john q public investor a millionaire for just buying a bitcoin right now. the cat is out of the bag, everything about bitcoin now has been fully disseminated, Buying bitcoin now is like buying a share of starbucks, nothing special or to it anymore.

vc money is going to run out, bitcoin needs some sort of kickstart. In this day and age after following bitcoin for the past 5 years, yes we have come a long way, but I thought we would be way beyond what is happening now. Think back at the internet and how fast it grew and was adopted.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:07:41
agree. it wouldnt surprise me if the price went back to the $300 or $400's. There are no buyers stepping in at these levels. Big difference between volatility at $200 volatility at $600. There is always a bias to the downside and more room to fall. Pumps were the same from $200 to $780 about $10 for each pump at a time. But coming down $300 in 2 days? World economies are in turmoil and people just dont have extra cash to put into something like this right now(college kids, teens, families).

agree 100%. if they cant provide the wallet addresses of where the stolen coins went to there wasn't a hack. I personally think they couldnt come up with fiat to cover a whale sale. so they had to save face by saying hack and saving the cred of bitcoin. how would  it look if a major exchange couldnt cash out a legit sale? would be like vegas not being able to cover a bet.

@_date: 2016-08-06 21:14:27
you say that they sold in hindsight. what did they sell at the top $1200? did they sell when it went to $36 for the first time? did they sell when it went to $100? or when it fell to $500 from $1200? they didnt have a crystal ball to know when to sell, so you tell me when was the optimum time that they sold? going from a few cents to $10 is a pretty nice return right? tell me when the early adopters sold?
My point is there are a few that control the market, they keep churning the bitcoins over and over and over. they have TOO many bitcoins. ANYONE buying in right now will never have more than some of these whales? Say someone want to buy 1% of all existing bitcoins? They will pay through the fucking nose for those coins while the whales are fully invested make their stake go up and they dump and can buy even more coins. THe whales are ahead of the game and institutions know they cant catch up by just buying on the market. So institutions are at the mercy of whales and this just isnt going to happen. Institutions will just find other ways to make money in which they are in full control.
@_date: 2016-08-20 11:48:44
such bullshit. if I bought for 10c and the price went to $32 99 out of a hundred are selling. $32 to $1000 99 out of 100 are selling. who in their right mind would hold from 10 cents to $1000???? not unless you have thousands and thousands and were able to cash out a millionaire maybe. there arent many early adopters left. they cashed out long ago and are enjoying their riches.

no, if banks and wall street and financial institutions were going to get in they would be in by now. i have heard the same rhetoric for years "once so and so realizes this and that then they will buy in". we as bitcoin buyers or holder are not smarter than heads of financial institutions. THey know as much as we know because all the information about bitcoin is fully disseminated and anyone can read everything that we read. its not a secret anymore. And for people to believe that all they have to do is buy 10 coins and wait to become wealthy is a pipe dream, because if that was the case wall street would have bought as many as their bags could fill and make the barriers of entry so high(pricewise) the general public couldnt afford a coin. look at berkshire hathaway stock. $218k a share, john q public isnt going to even think about buying a share right. bitcoin wouldnt even have to be at that price. I dont think anyone would shell out $10k for a coin.

could bitfinex be insolvent from a whale trying to cash out his bitcoins to fiat? bearwhale cashed out $26 million, what if this guy wanted to cash out $75 million? he could either crush the market or he could take cash and keep some coins. Bitfinex became the sacraficial lamb to save bitcoin so they dumped coins to collect fiat for him and maybe will sell others later?
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:22:39
there is no fiat coming into the game. institutions are not getting in. they are smart. they know they are too late to the game to get in. whales with 50000 coins can crash the market anytime they want. accumulate the fiat that was pumped in and keep buying back lower. rinse and repeat. how can that kind of power be challenged? thats why every single bitcoin pump ends with a dump. we just retraced all the way back to $465???? whales collected all the fiat from $780 all the way down to $465. bought back in to where we are at and will do the same again over and over and over

i havent lost money on an exchange. ive lost on dnm exit scams. 
i dont need your advice son. 
it wasnt seeing the future it was looking at the information and processing it. 
question: how could mt gox cover the market cap of bitcoin back in 2012? the market cap was in the billions and you think a one man show was able to account for that kind of money by himself? i was on btctalk then and it was computer geeks and college kids and younger wiring $500 or $1000 to mt gox and praying it showed up in their accounts. how much spare money did you have as a college student to invest?? another thing was that fiat withdraws were few and far between. another thing that was a sure sign of trouble was the ridiculous difference is price. I remember there were $200 spread differences for a long time between mt gox and the other exchanges. that threw up a red flag. you dont have to be a seer to see the obvious red flags.
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:20:04
bitcoin should be shorted down to a price point where there are more buyers than sellers and then go from there. It is so overpriced right now, there are no buyers.
@_date: 2016-08-20 11:32:25
i agree. i was buying at end of 2012 and I never gave it a second thought to wire them money ever. mt gox was never solvent. if you sell on coinbase right now no matter how many coins you sell you are going to get your fiat. mt gox was running a fractional reserve leveraged to the gills on the brink of a ponzi scheme. it maybe at most had 10 million in reserves. One whale sell and they wwould be wiped out. the whole thing was a scam. yes people got money in and out and did well blah blah, but for the most part anyone with half a brain at the time knew it was a sketchy as hell.

@_date: 2016-08-06 21:03:16
you are getting taxed 40% on capital gains here in the states. So 5 million is 2.5 million. ok a nice house say in california is at least $500k, taxes would be $10k at least per year, amoungst other costs. a nice car is what $100k insurance would probably be at least $1000 per month, shares of stock is gambling and you will get taxed on those cap gains if you make money, gold $1300 an ounce meh for what? The more you buy the more bills and leeches you have. Returns on cash are less than 1%. My point is the early adopters that have 20,000 bitcoin can just keep buying low and selling high because they can crash the market when they want. there are no deep pockets willing to step up and more or less buy and turn the table on the whale. If i had 20k bitcoins i would buy like now at $500 wait til it goes to $800 sell, no one will buy so I can take the price as low as i want.. So say my cost average of selling is $700. I just made an easy $200 x 20000 btc  $4 million dollars for something that eventually is always pumped. So When I crash the market maybe it goes to $600 I buy in again wait til $900 sell again make another $4 million, this has been happening since the beginnings of bitcoin. So why would I stop if I can keep doing this over and over?
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:04:05

@_date: 2015-08-09 15:45:26
As long as there is an incentive and it pays the bills i am sure there are plenty of miners who would point their rigs at something like this. Bitcoin has run it course. Everyone is just talking about blockchain now. I think in the future there will be something better to mine rather than bitcoins. There are just too few major holders of bitcoin for it to become a currency. I think it would be different if we were at say 1 million of 21 million coins mined right now but there are just too many out there for anyone with deep deep pockets to take a chance on their investment just being drained right out by a whale. Look at Drapers investment from the US Marshall auction. He spent how many millions of dollars at $600 per coin?

People forget that the only reason alt coins were invented was to allow those who didnt have fiat a way to acquire bitcoin. Most people into cryptos at the time were late teens and college students who are always broke. Where were they going to get $100's or $1000's to invest in bitcoin?  Hence altcoins. All you needed was a computer and a decent graphics card and you could mine and then trade in your alts on an exchange for bitcoin. That is all ether is good for, mine it and trade it in for bitcoin or fiat. Because long term the whales will be cashing out and it will be painful.

using lbc you are dealing with some of the sketchiest scamming scum in the bitcoin world. what do you expect?
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:39:15
I will be worried not addicted til there comes a day where there are buyers waiting in the wings to scoop up every last fucking coin that the fucking whales dump so they cant keep buying dumping then buying back cheaper all the time.
@_date: 2016-07-23 16:02:13
lmao, you are assuming that ethereum is telling the truth.
this is from the WSJ:
Late Tuesday in New York, total ether sold stood 43.75 million, representing 21,878 bitcoins or $12.7 million, based on the latest Coindesk bitcoin index price. The previous 24 hours saw a surge in orders as last-minute buyers sought to lock in the lower price.  
So you think everything is completely transparent and honest? Half of those bitcoins or even more could have been from the devs. They buy in and everyone sees the presale wallet only to be returned to them later. just to add even more hype. dont be so naive. the crypto world is one big pump and dump or scam.

I hear doing time in the angola prison in Louisiaba is some of the hardest time to do. what do you need bitcoin for, trade for cigarettes or somebody's dessert?
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:35:34
yes i agree, it is already built in. there are no buyers waiting in the wings and we just dropped $50 in the last 12 hrs for no reason other than profit taking. so why would there be a run up when whales/traders can't even wait til the halving to dump?

please stop saying miners will stop when/if it becomes unprofitable. companies work in the red for months or years sometimes before they start showing profit. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:07:53
i am broke i been buying since $780. waht do I do now?
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:38:36
Can someone explain to me why anyone would invest in a shitcoin that has a 72 million premine and unlimited ether to be mined in the future?
@_date: 2016-07-23 14:27:59
plus 10 million will be mined every year. lol
@_date: 2016-07-23 15:16:18
how many will be mined then per year right now?
@_date: 2016-07-04 23:32:04

use lbc and do a face to face transaction. meet at a donut shop most likely some cops will be around if anything gets sketchy

If he was smart he would sell his coins and disappear. Go enjoy your money before you get robbed and killed over $20 in one of the backward countries you are forced to live in.
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:57:25
I have never had a problem with coinbase or their kyc/aml protocols. I have nothing to hide so I abide and enjoy using their services.  if you do have something to hide why bash them? if you are too paranoid or feel it is too intrusive go elsewhere. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:28:22
you have proof that you sent money with the txn on the blockchain fool.

@_date: 2016-07-03 21:49:21
oh cause vinny said they are ok. wow i was getting worried
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:14:05
lmao why would I have low self esteem? 
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:22:07
I agree. It is uneven and that is probably why we haven't seen institutional size investors($25million to get out of bed type buyers). And please I dont want to hear off market transactions and all that bullshit, because if there was that kind of money flowing in there would have been leaks by now.
A hedge fund is not going to put in $50 million dollars see the price rise to say $2000 per coin, then a whale comes in and dumps 20000 coins and sends the price back to $700 because like always there are no buyers when this shit is falling ever.

seeing that he owns the hotel, he must be wealthy, tell him to just become a bag holder. what hotel by the way?
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:18:58
my goal is to sell along with the whales on every dump. that way I can keep buying back lower like them. so until we dont have 10% or more sell offs for no reason I might as well take advantage of the lack of buyers when these dumps happen.
