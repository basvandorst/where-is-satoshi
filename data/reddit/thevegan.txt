I take it you're gonna short every single coin you own then? Actually i would take a loan and short at 100x leverage. You are gonna be rich guaranteed. Am i right?

Are we looking at the same charts? Bull run?

This is like going to a church and ask people if they believe in God.

What could possibly go wrong!

What kind of ridiculous title is this?
Reported.

She is making fun of bitcoin.

I bought in between 20 and 50. And again quite a bunch at 250. Can't complain. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 13:33:52
I can't believe people still fall for these scams. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 20:30:26
Move away from the keyboard. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 16:30:30
No clue what you mean but it sure seems bullish at the moment. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 15:50:43
That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 13:05:37
And he's quiet. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 20:28:27
This is false. It was Linden dollars or whatever it's called and nowhere near this amount. 
I wonder how many times this needs to be explained before peolle will stop posting this crap. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 05:48:23
Which truth exactly? That the earth is flat?
@_date: 2016-07-21 10:33:03
I'm pretty sure the % of bitcoiners who were victims of fraud is higher.

Of course everyone here stopped clicking on links or attachments in randoms mails like 15 years ago right?
Why is it that this sub is the only place on the net where people still warn others about phishing mails?
Also don't people have mail filters? I've been using bitcoin services for years. Guess how many phishing mails i've seen? 0. Because they go to my spam box. 
How do you people always see these things?

It's what they do. It's part of their KYC rules. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 17:27:01
Good.

You must be making a lot of money knowing exactly what the market will do.
