Thank you. My issue was resolved last week without problems, bank holiday was the apparent issue. However, I'd still think twice before trusting Payeer, if only for their lack of responsive support. I don't like the possibility of money vanishing without a trace, as much as the next bloke..

At the moment its still unresolved but I'm more hopeful now, since I didn't account for Christmas being a bank holiday as I hail from a non-christian country. It'll probably be finalised during the week, as Payeer did finally reply to the support ticket.
I've heard OKPay don't accept deposits from US banks but I'm unsure about Payeer. There are few hops in the process so I'm unsure, like


It's a bit of a hassle. The consensus seems to be is that easiest way for US people is Coinbase.

Why not just move your wallet.dat to an encrypted truecrypt volume, symlink it to the Bitcoin data directory, mount it only when you access it &amp; sync that encrypted volume with a service like Dropbox?

Sad news, either its not DPR or he hasn't followed his own advice.
SR was/is revolutionary, the existence of which was predicted 20 years ago by Tim May.. I think the govt and institutions of the world will eventually lose, this is a futile war they're fighting since the crypto genie got out of the bottle long ago &amp; is rapidly reaching every corner of the planet via the ether.
The crypto spectre is still haunting the world &amp; we will eventually get to that point where individual autonomy, anonymity and privacy are guaranteed and protected from creeping entities by strong, well implemented crypto; 3d printing and the like. Good like trying to stop it..

Best thing I've read today. Props to your son who clearly has a bright future ahead and to you for raising him as such!

Yea maybe, or SpiderOak. But given none of these are truly open source and/or audited there's no way to confirm they've implemented end-to-end encryption correctly as they say they have. Better stick to local pre-upload truecrypt encryption.

Could you define stupid things? Does it include only Internet Advice 101 like don't click shady email links/attachments..? Or avoid all proprietary OS's at all costs, since now legitimate looking software updates can easily be faked &amp; compile everything from source? 
@_date: 2013-10-04 03:51:49
True, but there are people out there working night &amp; day to build an alternative infrastructure.. The GNU people are the most obvious example, or look at the long list at [PRISM-break]( 
If you're following Snowden related news, you should know its weakly implemented endpoint security that mainly whats wrong.
Please give an ear to what [Bruce Schneier has to say]( regarding the juncture we're at at the moment

Have to agree with your rant. Although I'm in love with btc as an idea, the qt client keeps having database corruption issues, is excruciatingly slow etc. which is exactly why, even today with 1BTC=~318$ mass adoption is still long way down the road.
PS: I found [this fix]( for the database re-indexing issue, but haven't tried yet. 
I want to keep running Armory, but running both it and Qt is quite heavy on a 8GB macbook, you need to compile Armory [from source in a quite weird way]( to be able to run successfully and I'm still lookin for a way to compile *bitcoind* on OS X instead of b-qt. For now, I'm also in the MultiBit/Electrum camp but Armory seems to have raised a sizeable amount of funds for future development, so I'm looking forward to that..
