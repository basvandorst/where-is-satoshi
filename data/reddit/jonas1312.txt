Thanks a lot!
So every software like electrum is a hot wallet and hardware wallets like ledger and trezor are cold wallets?
Is this right?

Thanks a lot!

Wow that's a complex thing. I think I should watch the video.
So on your opinion hardware wallet is the best and then comes the mobile wallet?
What's with a software wallet. I read some about electrum.

Awesome, thanks a lot!
I only have BTC for 250$ so I think a hardware wallet is not worth.
First I will use a software wallet I think. When I use a software wallet are the coins saved on my computer?
So for every transaction I need my seed to generate my private key?

What is a lighting wallet?

This sounds great!
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:14:42
Awesome! But this is not the end
@_date: 2019-06-21 10:59:27
Danke für die Info! Werde mir das auf jeden Fall mal anschauen.
Was ist denn deiner Meinung nach die langfristige Lösung?
Vielen Dank!

No, what does it mean?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:01:55
Yes time for me to
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:05:53
I want to start with 100€ I think. Payment would be great with credit card or if possible PayPal.
When I buy BTC on a site, will this site create a wallet also or did I need a wallet and a site where I can buy?
Didn't unterstand how I can transfer the BTC I buy will transfer to my wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:13:52
Of course not. But it feels bad when the prise is going down. I know it's normal.
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:17:30
Where do you buy? How you can buy automatically?
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:01:59
Three days ago, so totally noob.
And now I'm nervous about the negative trend and unsure if I should sell.
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:39:40
Can I buy bitcoins with this wallet too?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:02:38
I'm new and I trust you, I hope you are right
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:09:49
Ok I agree!
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:34:47
I bought my first bitcoins yesterday. I think it was a good idea
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:39:59
Thanks! It's really confusing to me right now, but very interesting.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:14:04
Just interested.
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:52:55
Thanks a lot for spending time for me! Helped me a lot!
