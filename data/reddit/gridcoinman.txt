These tokens need to be tied to Bitfinex's future earnings
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:10:52
Maybe they're only manually approving the small withdrawals.
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:47:17
The BFX tokens need to pay interest for there to be any demand!
@_date: 2016-04-11 16:53:22
They will fight it tooth and nail!
@_date: 2016-04-03 16:14:15
Unfortunately the mainstream media and the government propaganda news outlets have a firm grip on the minds of the ignorant and "educated" populace. 
I think the only thing that will shake the average person is another massive financial crisis/currency crisis. 
@_date: 2016-08-26 21:11:31
This is great news. And you can also get Gridcoin for your SETI cpu computations.
@_date: 2016-04-27 21:04:09
Yep, Origin should start taking Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2016-04-04 00:43:10
It never was. It was institutionalized by crooks.
@_date: 2016-04-13 22:58:27
Their CAD EFT deposits take like 3-5 business days to clear (due to Vogogo slowness), but the liquidity on their CAD/XBT pair is the pretty good.

Goldman Sachs could starting accepting bitcoin tomorrow and it wouldn't have the same impact as this!

This is precisely why Gridcoin exists and why it will continue to expand. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 13:57:56
It already has! Gridcoin is now doing more Boinc work on a daily basis than team  and  check it out:  By next year it will probably be more than the top 10 combined, and so on...

Who said it was good? 
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:46:50
The real shit show may start in the next few days as some major banks go under. I am fairly certain that many institutions are not ready for this. All kinds of derivatives might start getting triggered as a result of these crazy moves in the financial markets, there is no way to know who is liquid and who isn't. 
The entire financial system might begin to unravel!
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:55:36
Any former gov/banksters should be shunned!! These manipulative scumbags are not here to help! This woman is good example of the pompousness and arrogance that is prevalent in Washington.
@_date: 2016-06-02 23:34:27
Can you comment on what specific changes have been made?
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:42:48
They will probably rig the vote or something to make the UK stay. I would be really surprised if the Brits left the Euro, that would pretty much start the exodus for all the other countries, especially Greece.
@_date: 2016-06-07 17:54:54
Damn! I've heard that too.

Don't be so sure, this could make the 2008 crisis look like a skirmish. This is how major wars start. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 01:11:59
I am sure it's more than 12,  
I expect to see a spike in this chart next month!
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:08:45
Very well said. I myself had a small stake in ETH, but the way this whole thing unfolded made me dump all my holdings. There's just too much bullshit and propaganda. The DAO holders should have taken a financial loss over this hack, but the problem is that a lot of the devs also invested in it; it's all about money at this point.
@_date: 2016-06-07 15:20:56
I've heard they own 100 million bitcoin and own all Facebook &amp; Twitter stock. True story!
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:17:29
god willing!
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:29:55
Might be €500k in a few weeks. The trend is clearly up! We're talking about a country that has power outages and shortages of food. And people are still trading bitcoin and the volume is increasing with every passing week!!! If that's not a story, I don't know what is! 
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:42:27
Should have kept your mouth shut! Too late now.
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:39:20
Yep, it's all about saving their investment at this point, most don't give a shit about principles and all the pitfalls that ETH is opening itself up to down the line with these forks. 
What if nuclear secrets were locked in some kind of smart contracts? What if some highly damaging leaked info on some corporation/government is locked or operated via a smart contract? 
Are they gonna fork? Who decides? The miners? The implications and potential pitfalls are almost endless. Smart contracts may not be viable to begin with, let alone putting a $150 million in an experimental one, which had a loophole that the devs were aware of and didn't bother fixing.
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:37:16
Can any of us really claim that we are not really influenced by all this crap to one degree or another? 
@_date: 2017-01-04 02:45:52
You may be Venezuelan, but you clearly aren't aware of the crazy volumes on LocalBitcoins in your country. Do some research.

The fact that there is even a referendum in the the first place is already a big deal. The foundations of the EU are shaking and everyone knows it.

Is Poloniex next?

LOL! I believe you.
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:49:09
When bitcoin was at $1200 we had most of the volume going through Mt.Gox. Now we have Gemini, GBTC, Kraken and and an extensive global infrastructure behind bitcoin that is growing very rapidly. 
Even countries are now recognizing digital currencies as legitimate legal tender. The whole regulatory and business environment surrounding digital currencies today is nothing even close to what we had when bitcoin was at its all-time high a few years ago. Hell, there is even P2P bitcoin exchanges like Bitsquare now. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 15:17:46
The ZeroHedge gold-hoarding dinosaurs are not gonna like this!
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:15:23
There might not by anywhere else to run to safety, the paper gold markets are a face, its either physical metals or digital currency.
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:47:12
I agree. Too much giddiness in this subreddit about the price. I am excited and enthusiastic about bitcoin and its price, just like any other bitcoin supporter, but these cheerleading threads get more and more ridiculous with each passing day.  
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:55:23
Yep, I just did that! I should stop drinking so much coffee.
@_date: 2016-06-07 15:26:20
I expect to see a lot more of this in the near future. One day, people will be trading between each other using bitcoin and other digital currencies, and that will be the death of fiat! Sound money for everybody.
@_date: 2016-06-24 02:06:46
I find it hard to understand how there can be such an even split in the electorate on such a huge issue. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:49:28
I wouldn't be surprised to see new records in a whole bunch of other counties over the next few weeks.

“We make money if people use our network for storage. That’s our primary source of revenue, which means our entire existence depends on getting people to use the platform.”
This might be problematic in the near future. What happens when pirated stuff/child porn and other illicit material starts getting stored? The devs will be directly profiting from the storage of those types of files, no?

The big SHFT scenario is when the behemoths like  Deutsche Bank start going. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:00:15
The Mayans were right about 2012. Look what happened in the last 4-5 years. Crazy shit!
@_date: 2016-11-12 17:20:06
Deutsche Bank probably won't even exist in 6 years.
@_date: 2016-11-03 16:15:05
What an uninformed douchebag!
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:28:08
No, you haven't! This is your opinion, which is not backed by any hard stats or data. So stop presenting it as some kind of fact. Get some figures and then we can talk.
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:16:02
You haven't done your homework.

Let's see how bitcoin reacts over the next few days. This should be interesting.
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:42:07
Lots of thing are "illegal" that shouldn't be! You throwing that phrase around as if though it actually means something to anybody. Drugs are "illegal" and look at the damage the "war on drugs" has done in the US alone, never mind Mexico. The corrupt oligarchy makes up the laws as they see fit!! There are many, many good reasons why someone would want to move large sums of money in privacy and peace of mind. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 19:29:40
This "legal opinion" will have the exact opposite effect. Good job, ECB stooge!

bitcoin has never been "hacked", only bitcoin exchanges have been hacked in the past!
@_date: 2016-05-30 19:08:43
So, someone decided to buy lots of bitcoin and somehow that is deemed "manipulation"??

The only problem is that malicious advertisers might be able to plant malware in the ads. If brave can take care of the security aspects I can see people using this. The other issue would be automation. How can brave tell if a real user is viewing the ads or if it's a bot?

Isn't the XAPO card linked to funds held in a traditional bank? Or am I missing something? Is the bitcoin automatically converted into fiat at the POS?

Those poor souls in South America can really benefit from digital currencies; no more currency devaluation; free trade among the people. The benefits are many! 
I wouldn't be surprised to see more bitcoin adoption by the general population in the developing economies.
