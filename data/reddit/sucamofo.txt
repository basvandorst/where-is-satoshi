If you using Android there are a number of apps that allow you to add a widget to your home screen. I am not sure if any of them allow you to enter a certain amount of bitcoin so that you can see the value or not. Most that I looked at allow you to see the current price and other info.

I have been thinking about death. I don't personally know anyone, that I trust, who knows much about bitcoin. I have been trying to come up with a way to leave behind instruction in the event something happens to me. I have people I trust but giving them clear instruction on what to do and where to turn is the difficult part. I imagine most would look at my Trezor and think nothing of it.

Cash app sends me an email confirming evey bitcoin order.

Yes. I use Cashapp. I buy a few times a day and every morning I send what I bought to my hardwear wallet. Once verified it is very simple. Takes a few minutes once you have everything set up. I have never had a problem till this morning. I have been waiting for over an hour for my withdrawal to be confirmed. Almost two hours now. Never taken this long. Transaction does show up on the blockchain but still not confirmed. Plus I don't pay any fees when I move my coins.

Not to bad. I cover the spread. With the $5 I spent last night and the $5 I spent this morning I am only down $0.39 with current price. That's what I have sitting that I have not moved to my wallet yet.

Trust me. I'm trying! It's hard out here for a pimp. /s

I don't plan one ever selling. I buy daily. If the price is low I buy more. Today I bought $5.00 worth because of the run up yesterday. If the current price holds then I will not buy anymore till tomorrow. When it was in the 7k range I was buying $25 to $50 worth a day. 
As time goes on I will have a lot of coin. Hopefully at some point I will be able to live off this coin and not cash it in. That is why I don't plan to sell. I just buy or convert or trade however you want to look at it.

So I need a Micros USB to USB C cable. I think the Trezer is a USB C? Correct. My phone is a Micro USB
Looks like my phone supports OTG. Not sure I really want to use my phone but its good to know it's an option. I am about to switch to another ROM on my phone so once that is complete I am going to check this feature out. Might come in handy with the way I buy coins. I give myself a daily budget. As long as I don't spend my daily budget the rest goes to more coins. So I buy anywhere from $5 to $25 a day. 
Thanks for the info. I did not know this was a possibility. Really happy I bought a Trezor.

Not sure what wallet you bought but I have a Trezor T. I did exactly as the comment above describes when I first set it up. Transferred a small amount, reset/wiped the wallet. Entered my seed and was back in business. I have full confidence in my wallet now.
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:48:37
I have noticed this as well. There is good info here but you have to weed through all the negativity and saltiness. This why I rarely comment.
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:00:39
For the foreseeable future I don't plan on spending them. I just buy.

I have a gun safe and that is where my seed is located. I just need to type up instructions on what to do with the seed. The hard part is making sure I get every detail written out in a way someone with no cryptography knowledge can understand and follow. My safe contains pretty much anything of value or importance. Giving someone I trust the combo to the safe is the easy part.

Not sure what this has to do with bitcoin but okay. Thanks for the info.

I have a Trezor T. How do I get it to work with my phone?
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:08:03
I do. It's was a cheap joke. Sorry. I am more of a knife nut (see my post history) but I do like my guns. Cheers

I don't worry about fees to much. I use Cash app. I pay 1.6%. So $16 for every $1,000. I buy small amounts daily. So that 1.6% is nothing in the long run. I can loose or make more that $16 in an hours price change.
@_date: 2019-12-08 18:56:14
How much are you looking to sell? Never thought I would come across a fellow knife nut here. We have talked about knives in the past on that other sub. I have flair from knife swap. Message me and maybe we can work out a deal if you would like.

I am a man with guns. What does this have to do with me?
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:58:09
You need to average things out. My average price is around $8200. I bough high and low.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:41:56
With the current price I am bringing down my average.
