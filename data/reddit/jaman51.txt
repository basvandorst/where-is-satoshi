Hey, Amazon charges tax in many states, like where I am. So for those people, there is nothing to report.

Well, you can filter by non-mineable but I agree, any pre-mine over a certain threshold should not be included. Of course, the price has risen over the past few days by a huge amount, so it's warranted for something, but not that cap. I'm not sure if there's a chart that corrects for these, but since I think they call the amount from the coin's website, it is harder for them to choose.

As far as I understand it don't they transfer the coins to their own wallets? They show how much is yours, but it's not like you have your own address completely to yourself, so it does not mean anything. I may be wrong, but that's what I understood. No coin changes hands.

It sounds like you'd just give amazon some bitcoin at one point and just subtract it with each purchase, much like coinbase does. Or at least that's what I imagine.

If you pay from coinbase they send money in between accounts like transferring money from your savings account to checking. It doesn't hit the blockchain thus no fees need to be sent to encourage it to be processed as nobody sees it happening.

But were you going to buy a coke before you saw you could find yours or your friends names on a bottle?

About 90% of that is pre-mined and included in the charts, and the pre-mine will be given to Iceland in 3 weeks. So the real value on the market is about 10% of that, but the entire pre-mine is included.

Yup, but I don't remember buying anything online last year that should've been taxed that wasn't. So I legitimately had nothing to claim myself.

The problem with this is that people would buy items when cheap and return when the price goes up, so that the retailer would be forced to return more bitcoin, which most don't carry and thus would have to buy. They wouldn't have a problem returning fewer bitcoins, they would returning more (though if they sold 100% upon purchase, you'd just need to go to the exchange and buy $250 more). Those that hold coins would be forced to do extra work.
I think the easier thing for returns is to return the exact same amount of coin. If you buy something for 1 bitcoin and return a week later, you wouldn't get 2 coins back but 1 if the price changed that much.

They've had scaling problems, recently people purchasing with debit/credit cards were getting hit with multiple charges, loads of other issues people have.

I know it's popular to hate on Coinbase (and for good reason), but I had to sell a bit to cover rent and other expenses until I get a new job, so I transferred $2k from GDAX yesterday and it already posted in my credit union. Much quicker than I anticipated. Hadn't done anything since 2014, would have loved to hodl more.
