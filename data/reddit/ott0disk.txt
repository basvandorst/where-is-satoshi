Totally agree, ditch it.

wrong, you shouldn't even consider giving to someone 51% hashing power because it would make bitcoin useless

Update: the ATM is no longer here...I was at the Poulder cafe-restaurant 5 mins ago

QC are real and they are born to tackle the unfeasible.There are already quantum algorithms  able to solve integer factorization problem in linear time.Bitcoing actually relies on traditional (non quantum) cryptography and i can imagine someone coming up with a quantum algorithm for solving the inverse of SHA256 function, that would allow him to mine blocks crazy fast and "cheat" on the network.

it was ironic, if you follow the link you'll see a blank page :)

The logic behind the adjustment can be very sophisticated allowing spikes but not over a certain amount of % or time or even more complex things.the general network io and computation power is expected to grow as you said and so should do the block size
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:44:26
Perhaps we need a set of rules to drive and regulate the development process.Such a statute might favour security and openness, as examples.Anyway I would go for a dynamic size solution because it's long term, I believe the ultimate factor that ties the max block size is the average IO performance of the nodes.We certainly want to do spikes as number of tx and their size but remember we have to prevent attacks, thus the dynamic limit based on general network:p2p performance.

I didn't say SHA256 is about integer factorization, but if you know something about the qbit computing model then you know it is totally different from what's going on in your cpu. SHA256 will be just solvable for a quantum computer since its inverse is an NP complete problem and quantum computers can solve them in polynomial time (by definition) imagine to compute all possible solutions and match them with a superposition of qbit (it would require quite some qbits) then ask the oracle to pick the right superposition (it could be done in linear time), it might be hard to believe but QC can do things that seeml just impossible

Hey, another btc user here and for almost the same time 1,5 year.I have to say I am also a software engineer and I quite understand the protocol and the underlining crypto. I used bitcoins for a total of ~2.5 btc and usually purchasing them from kraken (I was about to use mtgox at the time but the js in the pages stank of s***),  I also tried local italian / dutch exchanges and ATMs and never had a problem actually but I have to say some of them are really overcomplicated. I used bitcoins to buy stuff online, to pay lunches and tech gadgets (not online), playing poker, and buying online services as well.From my POV they provide great speed and almost zero issue with privacy, usually it turned to be easier and faster except when paying in a shop where the clerks get shocked when you ask to pay with bitcoin (even thoug they have a btc POS).Also is noteworthy I did not care about the actual value, during this year I actually lost a lot of 'buying power' but it was accounted in advance and I still have 1 full btc :)

So by your logic bitcoin is not only a protocol but exactly that protocol spoken by a certain software: Bitcoin Core. Classic is a copy of Core with the  block size increased to 2MB and it will fork off Core's blockchain so you won't lose your precious btc.What is really changing is the development team behind those implementations
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:50:51
Agreed and what is evident from his words (see cypherpunks) is that he doesn't value trustless blockchains like bitcoin's. What if you have to deal with censorships? You won't use the myBank permissioned blockchain but you would use bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-16 17:52:40
So there is no mention about a block size increase?
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:21:29
It's because is technically not feasible, the main purposes of the blockchain is to coordinate consensus among the peers (aka mantain the distributed ledger) and do it in a very secure way due to the crypto.But the crypto stays secure only as long there are enough miners using cpu power to 'hash' the perfect combination of transactions and mine a block, in the end of the day cpu power is expensive and without enough power the network is vulnerable thus useless.IMB would probably sell software to run a full node and some lightweight client but who does the mining?If IBM only we may witness an epic fail as they got knocked down by a 51% attack ahah
@_date: 2015-04-09 18:43:21
Ok but if you look at the network traffic you can count the tx one by one and is ridiculous, i'd expect to see a huge stream of them.

Electronics not every day but pizza very often, as for now it covers around 60% of my online purchases and I'm looking forward to book flights with bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:57:07
Actually i do spend bitcoins almost every say, I order pizza from thuisbezorg.nl and I buy electronics online.Ah I also paid some hosting services in btc (with which I run a full node haha), so far i can say using them online has a very good user experience.

The amount should not be a concern since of the 21 million available you can divide each up to 0.00000001 btc , that is less then a millionth of it, also called a 'Satoshi'.Hence there are 2.1^15 parts in circulation and even if that's not enough you will see a big rise in the price per ¥\€\$ since it's a collectible. I totally agree on your point in being a safe harbor for people living in countries with an unstable economy, I guess it will save a few fellows!

So bad! But what if bitstamp really delete all the records for him? it would be very hard to pair his identity to a private key.

Good catch, early adopters need protection

"There is consensus on Segwit" .... "There is no consensus on Segwit2x" and who are you to say that exactly? Why don't you guys focus on doing something useful for bitcoin instead of constantly pouring toxicity on the debate? I personally run a SegWit enabled node (yes with BIP-148 not just signalling) because i want bitcoin to be upgraded and then i will support SegWit2x FOR THE SAME REASON.
