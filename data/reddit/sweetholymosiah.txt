nobody would confuse litecoin with bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:22:23
Great design. The ideas behind it are clear and effective.

Why buy passive exposure like a derivative when you can more easily just buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:17:24
I don't always buy Bitcoin, but when I do...
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:37:10
Good buy, bitcoin. Penis!
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:28:25
it happened so fast...
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:00:55
so essentially make a wallet on a cold computer?
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:44:25
CIA lost control of these tools recently. Now we don't know how many people have this tech, that allows the attacker access to pretty much any OS, where you might have an online wallet of bitcoins.

I definitely like the novelty of holding 1.0 bitcoin. But it's absolutely meaningless.

bitcoin needs oversight eh? How about oversight of the private federal reserve?
@_date: 2015-07-23 20:05:40
Does this suggest greater confidence in Bitcoin, thereby potentially increasing BTC value?
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:35:52
It's funny my mom tried to jump on board too, right around the $900 mark ...

I'm just guessing here, but I'm thinking you might save money if you take out a smaller annual 'salary', and get a mortgage that is within the means of your new income. Instead of one large lump sum at a huge tax bracket, you might save money by putting yourself in the middle class somewhere and pay 20% less income tax. Starting paying off that mortgage at a reasonable rate, and within five years your house value has increased. Sell that thing, make a few hundred thousand on which you will pay tax, meanwhile you still have significant bitcoins (that also probably increased in value).  
Of course if bitcoin crashes, you're fucked. Risk risk risk.

I would be thrilled if it hit $1000 as that is a level at which I would invest again.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:10:19
hey take it easy a guy can make a mistake. I wonder if the next time you're wrong you'll admit it so readily?
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:58:31
except bitcoin is scarce. Anyone can grow some fancy tulips.

decimate means reduce to 1/10th  
edit: whoops! I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:14:12
huh I'm intrigued that my English teacher taught me the wrong definition! turns out you are correct!

Charting is bullshit! Nobody knows the future based on the recent past.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:15:27
Care to make a wager on that bet?
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:51:07
I would think predictable supplier and maintenance costs are taken care of.

Decentralization can be a component of a strong federal system.

mitigated risk, he's not wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:51:54
Just the first. Also some credit check bullshit.

Coinbase is easy with credit card, and quadrigacx is a little bit cheaper if you can pass the damn identity hurdles. Took me like a month, whereas coinbase is like 15 minutes.

Until they own the market. Then what?
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:49:42
It's called monopoly! The answer to breaking em up is government regulation. Otherwise, the biggest corporations will take over and limit competition. Free market leads to monopolies. monopolys?
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:42:22
They were just WAY more racist.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:55:03
So many seem to be keeping their coins online. Is this really the case?
