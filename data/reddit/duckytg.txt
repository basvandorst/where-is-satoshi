Ahhh, another BHC redditer making a shit post. BTC is not falling just because it hasn’t his an ATH this week. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:07:55
I mean I realize everything with BTC isint perfect, but I would say a nearly 50% dip is a good correction for the market.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:30:32
Fear that the of doubling their money in a week won’t be fulfilled.

He did this because he didn’t want the public to think that his choices about LTC would affect his personal wealth.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:32:19
People have had this mentality since it hit $100. I thought it wouldn’t double for another few months or even a year, but 45 days later and here we are. I think it will slow down for sure, but there is a plethora of room for bitcoin to grow. 
Also, there is a plethora of room for bitcoin to crash. Invest wisely.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:54:33
+1 for the analysis and your name
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:12:28
Wait what? Just because it dipped $1500 you think the whole Coin is gonna crash? Yeah... okay, let me just invest all of my money into BCash real quick for EZ profits :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:36:21
Send your BTC to gdax, it is owned by coinbase and can do it instantly. And then send it to your wallet from gdax. They will cover all of the transactions for you.

Doesn’t sound as if he’s lost anything, just worried about sharing personal information with the website.

The miners are the people who profess the transactions. I am not too fluent within the crypto space, but I do know that the the people who mine the crypto currencies are the people who process the transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:52:56
Have you verified your account using photo ID and SSN?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:09
*goes up $200*
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:53:38
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:56:56
Don’t know if it would raise it instantly (might take a few minutes, all the way up to a few hours), but verifying your identity definitely gives you a bigger buying cap. Think my weekly cap is between $5-10k (I never ever exceed that), but verifying your account will allow you to make bulkier purchases for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:28:48
I know man, this is a very eye opening and insightful post.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:21:36
Yeah, CNBC is sucking BCash’s dick and the high transaction fees and slow delivery time doesn’t help.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:18:18
Don’t panic, I’ve only been in for a little over a month, but I’ve had my fair share of almost panic selling my stash. Just keep an eye on the price and if you see it drop to a “cheap” price then I would recommend to buy, bitcoin almost always rebounds within a two day period.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:25:13
No. r/btc believes that BCash is the real bitcoin and all they do is shit on Bitcoin and this sub reddit. r/bitcoin shares friendly memes and news. Stay away from r/btc.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:54:12
Every other shapeshift I have done has worked perfectly. Hopefully my transaction goes through eventually 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:51:21
Okay, thanks for the help. I thought this might be happening.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:11:01
Gold and bitcoin are not comparable. Gold is simply bought as an investment while bitcoin can be used as an investment, but also as a peer to peer transaction medium. People often refer to bitcoin as a digital gold, because that’s the easiest way for people to understand it, but it’s not identical to gold. So no, 1 bitcoin was never supposed to equal 1 gold bullion, no one really had any idea it would reach almost $20k though lmao.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:45:06
Responding to your 2nd edit, we are not hating on your for asking a question, it’s just that this sub reddit has be only questions about fees and confirmation times for the past day. So we are joking that you are posting the same thing everyone else is.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:14:32
I won’t be jumping ship for BHC, I would be doing it for other alt coins that I believe in.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:46:37
I mean .02 isint a HUGE deal to me, but it’s a little odd that the address I sent it to is still just holding it. Maybe I will get the XRP sooner or later. It is weird though that I tried to exchange ETH for XRP and it came back as “Failed”, i still have not received the ETH back.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:16:55
Thanks for the response, very insightful and true. However I don’t have the time to hold for years and years because of my current financial state. I don’t think I would sell ALL of my bitcoin, but would use it to invest in other alt coins. And you are very correct on the fact that alt coins don’t have the user base, but they fill different use cases compared to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:13:58
Lmao, very very true. I just don’t know how well I see bitcoin expanding for future use, thus my concern.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:54:40
That is because the market is up 300% in 45 days. It’s not hard for people to turn a profit when the entire market is being tripled. Not saying it’s impossible, just saying someone who doesn’t know what a wallet is shouldn’t be trying to day trade.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:36:27
You will get less bitcoin but they will be worth more. Supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:24:33
If you owned Bitcoin at the time of the hardfork in August 1, then they gave you the same amount but in BCash. They have made impossible to sell, but at 12pm EST people will be able to sell BCash and the price will fall.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:54:22
can you recommend any open source wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:41:36
They will wish they didn’t in about 12 hours when the price rises back to $18k+ lmao
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:48:57
I also think something like this is going to happen, gonna sell at my personal trigger and then buy back if it ever dips, if not then I tripped some money
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:49
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:02:50
Please explain as to how you think this is a pyramid scheme. Those require people directly recruiting other people and earning commission on behalf of their recruitment, nothing like this has happened or ever will happen with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:04:37
My question is why did you link a food network article lmao
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:28:33
Not through the block chain though, they are doing their job. The fraud has crept its way to the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:13:46
I’m here for the long term, not short term. Might move some of my portfolio out of bitcoin into other alt-coins that I believe have good use cases. But I do think bitcoin will rebound soon.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:42:35
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:18:27
I’m just losing faith in the scaling issue, not the vision of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:45:43
Don’t panic when it dips. I’ve sold around 20% of my bitcoin just because I panic sold when it dipped and lost a small amount of money in the end. Since you are young just hold the bitcoin, or even forget about it, and check back when you are twenty or so. Since you aren’t at the position to be investing large capital into bitcoin you shouldn’t worry to much about the price. Just keep on saving money and invest more if you wish,  but never invest more than you can lose.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:40
Bitcoin cash itself is not bad. It has a 2.5 minute transaction speed and lower fees, but it’s the community behind it that sucks. The main voice behind it, Rodger Ver, uses deceitful practices to attract uses to the currency. The r/btc is nothing but users thinking that BCash is the all righteous Coin. They don’t even acknowledge other alt coins.!I’ve been a long time supporter, but the current scaling issue right now is making me get a little worried. 
Don’t take all of these things as facts, but this is just what I have noticed.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:49:23
No noob should ever try day trading the most volatile stock in the world. I suggest you do a lot of reading before hopping into day trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:35:35
The transaction fees are some ass right now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:03:07
I bought at $7k, a few days later it crashed to $5k and now it’s at $17k, everything will be just fine.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:17:21
Dipping to $10k isint a real dip? Okay then...
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:48:09
That is literally what he said in his statement about it, I don’t know what else you could think he would be doing.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:38:31
Lmao let me invest how I want to ��

You have to get one of your parents to make an account if you are underage. No exchange will allow any one under the age of 18.

It’s not dipping, just going on a flash 10% off sale ;)

“There is no reason why we couldn’t see bitcoin pushing past $50,000 in December”.
These experts definitely know what they are talking about.
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:17:59
I think you’re forgetting about local, hand-to-hand, bitcoin transactions. Don’t need an Internet for that.
