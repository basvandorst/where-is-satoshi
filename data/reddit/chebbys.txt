it's not an obvious joke, and there are plenty of people who would actually believe this is a legit reason for restricting bitcoin usage worldwide....which I think is not funny at all.

Might be a straw man argument, but on a post talking about encouraging Muslims to use bitcoin you talk about bombings? Yes, bad headlines might come from encouraging a quarter of the world to use bitcoin. I'm sure some of them will use it for evil, as would any large group of humans given a powerful tool. There are a lot of people who still think positively of guns (for various reasons) despite the many negative headlines. 
I understand your point about the straw man argument, but the fact that a few bad headlines might come out of this is still not a good reason to avoid encouraging bitcoin usage if you actually believe it has benefits outside of money laundering/ etc.

I live 0.00 miles from the United States and the point is that the joke isn't immediately apparent from reading it. I can't tell if it's sarcasm or not and I live in a part of the country where people ACTUALLY say that shit on a regular basis. If you lived here you would see the ambiguity. 
I'm not trying to be an asshole about this but I just think here is the wrong place to joke about this sort of thing. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:26:22
Ah yes, and we all know that people come to reddit for all the most important bitcoin news. 
CMON PEOPLE. We have a reputation as a ~~humor~~ news website to uphold here

that would explain why it didn't mention Apple dropping the coinbase app. still a little annoyed about that shit, but not enough to buy an android.

Bitcoin being associated with Sharia law doesn't necessarily make it associated with a terrorist group just because the group wants to implement Sharia. Sharia is used in a lot more contexts than simply forceful implementation by terrorist groups, so to say "hey, there's a terrorist group out there who wants to force Sharia on people, so we bitcoin users should avoid Sharia like the plague" doesn't make sense. If we're going to talk about logical fallacies, there's one. It's like saying planes were used by muslim extremists in the 911 terrorist attacks, therefore we should keep everyone in muslim countries from using planes because at least some of them will use planes for terror. Planes obviously have many more useful purposes than destroying buildings, and that's why we didn't force everyone else to get rid of them all after 911 (as if we could ever do that). Bitcoin has lots of useful purposes beyond sketchiness, so it's perfectly reasonable to encourage everyone to use it, and to avoid promoting it to a very large percentage of the population because of some xenophobic mistrust of what might come to pass is ridiculous. 
And that's my overall point with the whole "all Muslims aren't terrorists." Don't be afraid to associate muslims with bitcoin just because you are worried a few bad people might use it to do bad things, and likewise, don't be worried that a few idiots (most right here in the U.S.) will watch Fox News and think bitcoin=terror. There are a lot more people out there who won't think that, and there are a lot more Muslims who would use it for legitimate purposes.

chill dude. people use bitcoin for different reasons. 
Unfortunately I think bitcoin (or any other digital currency) will lose anonymity as it gains popularity as a payment system, which is probably what's going to happen. If you want to remain anonymous, you can always use another digital currency, but whenever these currencies get popular a government is going to want to know what's going on with money being used in and transferred out of their country.  And they are going to want to tax it. I doubt that will ever change unless we live in some anarchist society...and fuck that I like having police and fire services.

for everyone bitching about coinbase being slow...read this. I'd rather have my money slowly than not at all.

i don't get the metaphor...

you could always look at your bank statement from when you withdrew the cash (assuming you had it in a bank in the first place) as evidence of your taking out money and investing in bitcoin.  Honestly I wouldn't report it though, especially if it's only $500.  The feds have bigger fish to fry - you won't even show up on their radar.  The people who cashed out yesterday and are transferring stacks on stacks into US banks on the other hand...

I read something that said 1% of your total investment portfolio (including savings).  If you don't have investments, then 1% of your savings is a safe but conservative bet. 
I'm at like 10-15% right now but fuck it. I like me bitcoins.

Ok I think we are getting away from the whole point of OPs post by talking about Sharia in depth, because again, you are conflating two different things - muslims and their tangential relationship to sharia (at least in modern times). A lot of muslims don't even follow it, and many who do don't follow it very strictly...and the reason OP was talking about using Bitcoin in Muslim communities is because it meshes well with Sharia's application to BANKING. We aren't talking human rights here. And if some jackass joe/sally from Alabama thinks bitcoin is bad because they don't understand the difference between strict adherence to Sharia and the way it permeates other aspects of Muslim life in more subtle ways (like the banking system), that's their problem. We shouldn't create policy that's based on a fear of what these peons think. If that were the case we would still have segregated schools and the supreme court would have upheld the gay marriage bans. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:44:14
dude come on. There are 1.6 billion muslims and about .00000001% of them are terrorists. There are probably more gunslinging crazies in the U.S. than in the entire muslim world. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:39:58
Lol ok have fun doing that. If you live in the U.S., you might as well leave now cause that shit aint changing. I hear there's a libertarian bitcoin circle jerk somewhere in the South Pacific. Check it out!
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:30:25
This is fantastic PR for bitcoin. Needs to be circulated widely.

I would also recommend Ally Bank. I switched from Bank of America and have been with Ally for a little over a year now. I was thinking about local credit unions but ultimately chose Ally because...
a) they have basically all the same perks as credit unions in terms of great interest rates for your checkings/savings account and non-invasive phone calling, 
b) Ally is much larger than most credit unions so their services are a lot more streamlined and well thought out, and 
c) they have 24/hr phone service and incredibly fast wait times, which was useful while I was traveling in Europe and Asia last year and needed to get in touch with them without spending a shitload on minutes. 
If you need to deposit cash or like to have a physical branch location to visit though, credit unions are the way to go.

It actually depends on when you place the order.  During all the huge selloffs they usually have a little box at the top of the "buy" page saying you will pay market price at a later date for the coins because coinbase has reached their selling limit (ie they don't want to sell their coins right now for a discount).  If there is NOT a box there, you pay market price now for coins that arrive later.  This is from personal experience.  They are also rolling out a system where you can buy a small amount of coins instantly and receive them on the spot, but it's usually less than one coin.

this crash is intense. I'm shitting myself a little...but not selling
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:18:58
haha fair enough and I get what you mean. I think we can both agree that it would really suck if bitcoin were used for terrorism, and I hope one day we can see it used for lots of good in the world. This is why I like reddit - it's possible to have a conversation with someone in the comment section not have to deal with trolls. Beats youtubes any day. have a good one sir
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:25:29
Less serious than the headline suggests. They are basically just saying buy at your own risk - it's volatile and can be stolen if you are an idiot with your coins...which is exactly what we have known this whole time.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:50:26
A $35k speculative investment? I sincerely hope you are worth at least $10M, otherwise this is batshit. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:23:43
Also I have no idea what you mean by "if every muslim were to use bitcoin, then every sharia touting terrorist would use it."
If every American uses it, then every drug smuggling and prostitute buying American would use it as well....right? 
Are the rules of morality somehow different when applied to Americans/Europeans/non-muslims? I don't see why it's worse for one subset of a large group to misuse something than it is for a subset of another large group to misuse it.
