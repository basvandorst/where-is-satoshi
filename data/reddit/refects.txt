Bitcoin is less than half its all time high. If you bought the the very top, you would only be down ~45%. Did you buy alt coins?

Whales are playing games. I'll be equally as unsuprised if it drops to 9k or pumps to 13k.

Actually, it looks like you're 44 years late. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:59:45
Yeah, I thought we decided that Tesla was the new lambo.

You're a big guy
