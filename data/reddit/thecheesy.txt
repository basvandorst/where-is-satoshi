I'm pretty new to this, but why is there this tension between the bch and btc communities?
I figured it was like LTC, or ETH originally, but personally I hold no bias between them but I can see it leaving a bad taste in the mouth of anyone using other cryptos when you say things like that about a currency they have some holdings in.

Or just call it Bitcoin to add to the confusion.

It's buggy and slow with lag and disconnected during peaks, but I've had no major issues with it.
I still don't know how I feel about them.
The site lacks many members allowing you to score some amazing trades every so often, but that's also a curse since it lags behind other exchanges outright missing some of the highs. I stopped using them, but it's probably fine.

Tbf, the slogan for btc "store of value" is insulting and bites it in the ass whenever it dips.

I blame exchanges that rely on btc to trade to other currencies, people bail out crashing alt-prices to get into btc then to fiat. Also manipulation is probable, but I think this is bigger than Roger. He couldn't do this scale of attack.

I sandboxed the virus and it doesn't inject, it spams out like 6 or 7 different exes and you can delete them all with ease, close the processes for each, delete the DC log (DC is a free remote access trojan.) Which means he's either really awful and doesn't code his own and is also cheap dirt cheap, and considering it gets detected fast he doesn't own a crypter. If you'd like me to go over some stuff with you I can show you where it installs and what it does.
@_date: 2014-12-01 03:04:31
So you sent the owing balance to paypal (it takes 6-8 days). 2 days later it freaks out and forces the 270$ from your bank account to your paypal. It will also take 6-8 days. then 2 more days it does it again. until it arrives.
I ended up with 120$ in NSF fees from a dumb impatient buyer who didnt know the tracking info said it was at his post office. My bank covered 1 fee as a first time thing. and paypal said sorry and paid the a percentage of it. I made no money. I actually lost money on that sale and he eventually got the item and said sorry I didn't know how to track it.

Yea, Someone would need to get it going and post around to gain some interest a lot of people would flock in and check out the concept. 
For leading individual projects, I guess that's up to the community. A dev team could sign on and get some assistance, or a user that has a good idea could make his post pitching his ideas and concepts.  
Obviously this is focused more on a community with multiple games being worked on simultaneously. It could be more slimmed down to just 1 game at a time, They'd go through several phases over that development cycle.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:34:00


This is brilliant. I would love to just hop on board with game devs to do my part and assist it's creation with my free time.

They will force businesses to enfore it. Making any business dealing with the US using BTC be forced to add a tax to sales.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:51:40
It could be done fairly simply to be honest. Sadly it wouldn't really fit into the basic subreddit.
Let's say in a subreddit format we'd have a section for...
- Brainstorming ideas and concepts. 
- Applying for a team/game and advertising new plans.
- Community tasks where the chosen team can post open tasks and requests for textures sounds and provide examples with an open discussion.
Once a game has been planned out and agreed on it could move along the stages to get a team organized, It can stay open for public builds and testing, and more devs to join on until its gets past 60% to save it from getting leaked. Then it would rely on the team gained to finish it with community assistance on the side.
To be honest it really does sound like an idea that would really gain some traction.

It's likely they suspect money laundering or something malicious and it might press them to want to open an investigation or audit you.
If you get audited that's going to be a long annoying pain in the ass.

If it crashes a bit after 10k usd than I think May is a good bet, but if it keeps climbing like this I'd say 20k by late December/early January.

I know you didn't mean it like this, but that could work both ways, btc isn't anything what it used to be and bch is pretty much what btc used to be. 
While also Btc is the original and Bch could be see as a cheap replacement. I do want to give you insight on the minds of Bch users: They see it as Btc has changed far from what it was originally and has been basically taken over and is being replaced with what it is today. They see Bch as a more efficient recreation of the original.
I'm somewhere in between feeling guilty no matter what I say.

Honestly I prefer using bitcoin cash as of late, but I sort of agree that it probably needs a different name. The opposing crowds clash too much to the point of harming both currencies reputations which is bad for digital currencies as a whole.
I'd prefer a name switch, but it's probably too far along for that now. Nobody would accept it.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:02:55
Exactly, it's starting to harm both currencies at this point.
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:03:50
Apologies but when I said "it works both ways" 
I was referring to his statement 


You call bitcoin cash a phishing scheme. Wouldn't that make every other crypto currency also a scam by that logic? It's functional atm, I don't know how I stand with it right now but I want to see it's future play out.
I don't quite know if I trust in bitcoin anymore. 
In my own opinion it gained its initial value in being a functional and fast way to send money for dirt cheap. Once it picked up people looked at it as a get rich quick scheme and it blew up. With it congested slow and expensive what gives it value as a currency now? I know about the lightning network but it's fairly complex and optional. I can't see how the vast majority of users can adopt such a complicated system, especially the users who'd be getting mixed up on which bitcoin is which.
Don't get me wrong I want it to succeed, but I personally am feeling unsure about how it's currently playing out.

Kinda on my own with no family to get assistance from in a beat up house things seem to fall apart a lot $350 doesn't put a dent in it, I just wanted some breathing room. Just got a new job and that was great but haven't got many hours in due to restructuring. and little work really doesn't make much for money. I didn't notice my post has kinda dripped off what I wanted to ask and went on more of a rant, sorry about that.

Wow man, you really went through the effort of that, Thanks for looking out!
I do game a lot, but I never let it interfere with my personal life. 
My rig is worth a lot, I actually won the gpus in a company related event and I was given the CPU by my last employer I knew him on a personal level and we were doing a shitty dk2 contract and my PC couldn't handle the load and made for poor testing and debugging.
I realized my problem after posting and deleted the thread. 
I need money I shouldn't be pouting about it like that though.
My cats [like a brother to me btw](
About cable cutting, That is done. In that post you read I was using past bills to make a point. I share a netflix with my ex, Somehow she doesnt seem to mind.
I really like what you said about just getting up and leaving, I have trouble finishing a lot of things I get myself into. I feel like I always need change, but that's quite hard with everything going on it might only make everything worse.
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:47:02
It might actually be a mistake. Every other language but english says bitcoin cash on that dropdown.
Also should note, if you try to buy btc on that site it does warn you and explain the differences. 
I've never used the site, but I figured I'd dig around it to see what was going on. Also if they were trying to decieve users with this why would the do it on the block explorer?
