I'd say you've nailed it. If they actually had the coins, there would be no need to freeze bitcoin withdrawals, they could just temporarily stop re-sending coins to any customers who claim to have had a failed transaction (until they sort things out).
I think it's very likely that people exploited this flaw for quite sometime before Gox caught it, and now they're short on coins. And even if other exchanges weren't as stupid to make the same mistake, I think it would be folly to assume that this wouldn't have lasting repercussions on the entire bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:26:03


Oh really? And what do you think creates demand?


If people who "invest" in bitcoin have their money held hostage—no matter how temporarily—what do you think that does to confidence in the marketplace? What is the point of having a decentralized currency if you're subjected to the whims of a handful of large players?

Even if that is true (which is highly dubious), you could do the exact same thing but start from scratch and save yourself ~$400 million.

@_date: 2014-02-15 22:45:39
That doesn't mean you are allowed to unilaterally alter the terms of an agreement after an agreement has already been made. MtGox's "terms of use" state that no commissions will be charged to bitcoin or currency transfer transactions; that is what their customers agreed to, and now MtGox is holding their depositors' money hostage and violating their own terms by offering a 5% extortion charge that was never agreed upon in the first place.

That doesn't change the fact that it makes *ZERO* sense as an investment. Why not spend hundreds of millions of dollars to pay back Enron shareholders? That's not an investment, that's charity... and it's not like you're helping terminally ill children or hurricane victims. These are people who put their own money at risk of their own volition, because not only did using MtGox come with well documented risks, but bitcoin itself is inherently speculative and fraught with risk.
My point is that not only is it an incredibly stupid idea, but it would never work because you'll never find enough people gullible enough to invest $500,000,000 just to pay back Gox victims.

I may not gamble, but I still understand how odds work. Your offer was that if you win, you get at least $10,000 worth of bitcoin... but if I win, I only get $1,200. You're essentially offering better than 8:1 odds *against* bitcoin reaching $5,000 in 22 months. Your offer speaks for itself.

...or people could just decide to stop using it because it's such a pain in the ass. It really doesn't matter how sound the concept is, or how secure the code is—that isn't what gives it value. If people decide to not use it, then your bitcoin is just meaningless data sitting on a myriad of systems that are wasting a staggering number of compute cycles.
How much trade is conducted in bitcoin? I mean *actual* trade of goods and services, not just speculators trying to turn a quick buck? I see people making the occasional purchase with bitcoin just for the novelty of it and to reap that sweet, sweet karma on reddit... but how many people are earning a paycheck in (and making 100% of their purchases in) bitcoin?
For bitcoin to reach $5,000 by the end of 2015, based on the approximate number of coins that will be in circulation by that time, it would have a market capitalization of more than $70 billion... that's more than the annual GDP (nominal) of Cuba. Do you honestly believe bitcoin will produce enough economic activity to get it there? Because I seriously doubt speculators pumping up the price on sketchy "exchanges" are going to get it there, especially when one or more of those exchanges goes tits up.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:20:54

They're offering people a 5% "withdrawal fee" just to *withdrawal their own money*?! Isn't that basically extortion?

You realize that the number of bitcoins in circulation isn't the only thing that influences price? You don't think hundreds of thousands of people losing huge sums of money, and the resulting negative media coverage, are going to negatively affect market sentiment regarding bitcoin?
If everyone in the world but you lost all of their bitcoin, would that make you the richest person in the world? Would your bitcoin holdings now become worth the entire ~$7 billion of the bitcoin market cap, or would your bitcoins now become worthless?

"Low price" is an extremely relative term. This is honestly the worst possible place to ask advice on when you should invest in bitcoin. I've seen *many* people here suggest that it was "a great time to buy cheap coins" after the price fell below $700, and then $600... and $500... and on and on. Do what you want with your money, but I wouldn't recommend making any decisions based on the suggestions you get here (and yes, I'm well aware of the irony in recommending to not follow any recommendations).
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:53:04
If we start from the assumption that the current value of a single bitcoin is approximately $650, then in order for a single bitcoin to reach $5,000 by the end of 2015, the value of bitcoin would have to increase by 770% over the next 22 months. At that rate, in less than a decade, the value of bitcoin would be __*QUADRUPLE* the annual GDP of *the entire planet*.__ Does that sound like a reasonable expectation to you? Do you actually believe it would be possible for bitcoin to not only supplant every other form of currency currently in existence, but also somehow magically quadruple the productivity of the entire planet... *in less than 10 years?!?!!* I'm sorry, but that is delusional.

I think the story is that MtGox didn't lose 700k all at once, but rather that is the **_cumulative_** amount lost over the period of a couple years. As long as people kept moving new bitcoin *into* MtGox (for arbitrage or whatever reason), they could shift coins around and no one would notice for awhile.
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:07:38


The thing that 99% of the members here aren't willing to admit is that the only reason to use bitcoin at this stage is if you're interested in currency speculation. If bitcoin does end up becoming some revolutionary one-world currency (highly dubious in my opinion), then I will eventually conduct business in bitcoin and earn money the same way I do now: by actually making things.
Some people here seem absolutely convinced (I would even say delusional) that their bitcoin will someday be worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars... even if that eventually turns out to be true (which I, again, find to be highly dubious), I won't feel as if I've missed out for the same reason I don't trade on the forex market: I'm not a currency speculator.

A lot of the true believers around here like to point to past hiccups as proof that bitcoin is robust, resilient and will always recover in the face of a panic... but I think things may be a little different this time 'round. Even if recent problems are resolved in a timely manner, and bitcoin proves to still be a viable platform... just because it's *viable* doesn't mean people are still going to want to use it.
In the past, it was only the true believers and kool-aid drinkers that needed to be reasurred in order to re-inflate the bubble... but this time around—due to a recent explosion in media coverage and a horde of bandwagoners buying into the get-rich-quick mania—I'm not sure it's going to be so easy. I think this time Mt. Gox will prove to be a poison pill that may result in a long, slow downward spiral for bitcoin. There's now a huge amount of extremly *negative* stories about bitcoin in some major publications, so I'm not so sure the newcomers are going to so easily be swayed by stupid "hold Spartans!" image macros anymore. Only time will tell.
