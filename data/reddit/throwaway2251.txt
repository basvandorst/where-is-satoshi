How can I enforce my option? Is it a legal contract like real options? Or am I relying on *that website* to enforce it? Will they make you pay the bitcoins to them now and keep them until the option expires?

No, they should just go to the owner of Deep Bit and requisition it.

The problem is you can never **prove** that a transaction was fraudulent in the first place.

Nicely put. Jeez, I wish people like you got a bit more credit.
Just because you disagree with someone, does not make them stupid. Not even if you disagree with them really really much and you're very right!

Yes it was.
That's not a bubble though.

Coins *are not* fungible. You can not replace one coin with another, because coins' histories are entirely non-transferable.

I didn't say people didn't value it. I happily accept that they did. Wrongly.
Still not a bubble though. The difference being the new information. If the price went up and down the same way purely due to speculation, without any new information about efficacy, that would be a bubble.

There are a lot of people out there who would not realise what it meant if their GPU fan was at 100% all the time. Most people would probably think the fan was malfunctioning.

I believe the patent trolls could go after the offshore hosting company. Unless the patent is not also valid in that foreign country. In which case, you don't need bitcoin, just sell/run your software from that foreign country.

Or it turns out it always was (highly over-priced), but no one realised.

USB sticks crash more often than hard drives. Just keep it encrypted on your hard drive.

That doesn't give a bitcoin any inherent value. If bitcoins are otherwise worthless, costing money to produce does not make them worth anything. Even if it did, this would be the *maximum* price of a bitcoin, not any kind of "real value".

Your average Joe isn't trading bitcoin on Mt. Gox.

I'm pretty sure they're blaming security flaws that they hadn't had time to fix, left there by the previous owners of the site.
