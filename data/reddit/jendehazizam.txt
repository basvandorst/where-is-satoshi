My story about CEX:
Got my first withdrawal of 15-11-2017 on 29-11-2017 in EUR (from IBAN: X) Got my second withdrawal of 16-11-2017 worth of €13000+ in USD on 6-12-2017. (GOT USD INSTEAD OF EUR)
After 1 week of receiving USD instead of EUR. I got response to double check if I got USD and not EUR &gt; E-mailed back with proof. Aftwe 2 weeks of receiving USD instead of EUR. I got response that they have double check and have send EUR and not USD. And asked me to contact bank and send them confirmation &gt; E-mailed cex back with proof USD is send.
Because Cex send me USD and not EUR, I still need to get remaing amount of €2180.
2 weeks further now and still no solution........
