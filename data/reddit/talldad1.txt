Cool.  Thanks for the update!

I think I'll stick with Gemini just to keep things simple, unless you know of a better option?  Gemini seemed pretty safe and legit.

Is it common to think that the dollar will collapse someday soon?

I own a bitcoin.  I hope it increases in value.  This chart is hard

What do you mean that I am a troll?
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:02:26
Really?  So you would be fine paying $10,000 for a Bitcoin that drops to $0.01? No offense but I find that a little bit hard to believe. I would think that when it's at $0.01 there's no reason to believe that it will rise again past 10000 so that would obviously be problem.

Whatever it's all good. Just curious why you assume some ulterior motive with someone who was asking a question.
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:57:46
Sure I think I understand that. But what is your number? I mean if Bitcoin drops to $100 and it stays there for 10 years are you still going to be a Bitcoin believer? I would just think that the credulity stops at some point.

You're describing cryptocurrency right?
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:00:00


Absolutely,  unequivocally, no.  I would see it as a bad deal I got into and get out of the market.  I wonder what it would be like to enjoy the speculation of Bitcoin but it's just not my thing at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 01:42:52
Also you miss quoted me and I think you got the essence of my question wrong anyway. At some point Bitcoin will stop rising in price so I'm asking what point that would be. If it gets $200 per Bitcoin and then stops rising in price it would be pretty stupid to hold on to it.

Got it.  Have a good one
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:55:36
I appreciate all the articulate responses to my question.  Thanks
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:58:32
Because it already has stopped rising in price? Bitcoin has dropped significantly in the past month and it's dropped even more significantly in the past year.  There must be some number that the price would drop to for a certain length of time that would make you question whether this is a good investment or not. I'm just curious what your number would be.

No I was just asking if I was understanding what I perceived to be an undercurrent of your statement. It just seemed like you were describing the concept of cryptocurrency in general. Almost sarcastically.
