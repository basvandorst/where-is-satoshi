Thanks for the explanation that makes sense.

I mentioned to a friend with lots off disposable income when they were at $20 to by some.  He didn't.  He still asks me how my magic beans are doing.

Fuck it I think I will order a million bucks of btc miners. I don't have a million bucks but I'm good for it . Cause if the btc don't work out I will just use my massive green houses to grow weed in

Why have a greenhouse and then grow under led. Doesn't that just make it a room

If I remember when you set up a wallet there and click the tweet link they credit you with some free BTC, I'm sure I got 0.05 but that was before the price rise
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:20:10
Nope. I just finished on 4 drops and only committed on one. The others I committed at the lowest price. Although now between paying for and receiving my MFLB the price of bitcoins went up drastically.

The joys of being an early adopter. The bank and government don't want it to be easy. Think how much the banks stand to lose when you don't pay there exorbitant fees. Think how much the government stand to lose in potential taxes. Its there lively hood we are threatening

Can you use bitcoin to by unicorns? My kids would love one what's the asking price for a unicorn nowadays. Hear they are pretty rare.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:17:15
Its quality. If your not in a rush for whatever you buy. They organise group buys and pass on the discount . good site
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:20:53
Sorry but I'm unaware of any legal implications of not buying your bitcoin from coinbase. I live in UK I haven't bought any btc from coinbase. Breaking the law, breaking the law
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:35:24
They need bigger servers. Still not convinced its not an attack. People dont generally dump $20-30 below asking price. When its been rallying hard the last few days

You can I paid for my Gold sub with bitcoin!

Using Bitcoin will make no difference. Look at the exchanges being griefed at the minute. If you tried to skirt round the system I think the site would get shutdown. People want to invest easily in startups or projects, not start a game of cat and mouse with regulators / government.

Are you based in Nigeria by any chance?
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:09:28
You sent 2 btc to some random address without even seeing the miner? You could off gone to collect with a 2 btc paper wallet. Some sort of brother he must have just to leave him his Jupiter with no operating instructions. Did he claim to be Nigerian by any chance?
@_date: 2013-05-27 21:17:08
Sorry So many Cryptocurrencies

@_date: 2013-12-04 15:31:47
Maybe contact several exchanges or large sellers. Try and sort out a deal also I would give some away..

Good on you. The more people that understand and use it the better. Wish I hadn't off used nearly all of mine on purchase a few weeks back. But we have to spend them if we want them to be used in more places. Im in the UK but the majority of people I've mentioned it to just don't get it . 
@_date: 2013-05-31 20:16:11
No thats the amount from the graphics card at 140MH each usb chip is 330M/Hs.
So at a rough guess my math says hes making about $100 per day

It's made of cheese? 
@_date: 2013-07-08 11:44:03
Is this the new standard in the UK. Have any association with bitcoin and have your account closed with no means of appeal. I'm now concerned I bought a few bitcoin a 6 months ago. I have a mortgage with same bank what if they just decided to close my account it would cost me thousands in fees to rearrange. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:12:07
You need to make several paper wallets. Transfer funds into those. If you can read about using an offline computer for this. There's guides about. I would also suggest a client like Armoury. 
Spend some .Sell some but enjoy your new found wealth. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 19:06:23
This thread looks cool it's hard to find stuff to buy with BTC in UK though. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:11:44
I have a friend on the transplant list waiting for a kidney. If your   interested and a match of course i'll take it for 1 BTC. That is all the bitcoin I have but you can have it

That is an awesome story Gspotassassin good for you on taking a shot and investing in something you understand and believe in.

I spent all yesterday morning trying to recover 1 btc from a borked bitcoin-qt. It was painful it wasn't fun and i'm a nerd. Most people cant be bothered with the hassle

The idea of setting up a paper wallet for your kids in the future is a really good idea. Thhink I will be setting up 3 of these as saving funds for the future

If someone had just cracked your wallet and returned your funds. I think the first thing that you would do is transfer to a new wallet and new password. Unless your a retard

Damn it. I'll never get that unicorn. :[
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:53:36
Look into using Armory as your client on the old laptop. Keep it offline and use it purely for saving

I've done this. The other week I bought a few BTC. Paid via BT and the transaction took all day to process. It was a proper nerve racking day. Although I kept in touch with the seller through the day. There was always a worry when they went off-line. It was all good in the end. But I wouldnt say it was a pleasant experience. I have no body to meet up with local for a face to face exchange. UK

this both sucks and blows at the same time. Had used transferwise several times to avoid the banks crazy fees

Bitcointip will set up a wallet for you. which you accept then you can transfer funds to your blockchain wallet. You'll pick it up over time
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:40:54
Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. Maybe they will be worth much more maybe they will be worthless. Nobody knows. All I know its one hell of a ride once you hold some. You don't even have to buy a whole bitcoin. You could buy a fraction of a coin and leave it a year or so. It seems to be going more mainstream

Okay okay your an idiot! You wouldn't of mailed out 2k cash to someone hoping you might receive something back. It seems you have just come here to clarify that you sir are indeed an idiot. Sorry if that's harsh but I think that's the answer your after. So there you go. Posting on here isn't going to get your btc back. Only confirm what you already know. Unlucky.
