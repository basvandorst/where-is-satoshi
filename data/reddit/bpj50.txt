Developer here. You're right, this isn't Bitcoin.
We're days away from implementing a wallet and our implementation is similar to blockchain.info where we'd never have access to your bitcoins or keys.

This service is designed for people who have bitcoin, but need to make fiat payments.

How long did you have to wait for your 2 bitcoins? :)

Once I went to an exhibition on the 'Future' in a Bangkok mall and Bitcoin was featured.

Great that you're accepting Bitcoin. The guys from Bitcoins Berlin and I will come say hi for sure.

I couldn't believe that I had to pay €30 for a VISA card when I came to Berlin.
I have also had many American couchsurfers who couldn't believe how futile their plastic was here.

Thanks leonardobetti!
I'm in charge of UX :)
They'll hopefully be a big revamp soon

The benefit is a more convenient flow for those users who want to use Trezor.
We do not consider the Trezor Connect API as a trust point. It simply reflects the required payment. The user is still responsible for checking and authorising that payment.
True, it would be nice if were possible to pass Trezor a BIP-21 url, but maybe the devs saw that as overkill.

Great idea. Hope to be able to buy more stuff with Bitcoins in the future.
