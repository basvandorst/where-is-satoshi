Probably won't lower level fees anyway, that's the beauty of it.

Seems like this guy was the victim in this case, I'm just the guy looking while passing by without calling 911.

You can buy whatever you can afford to lose, whenever you have the extra cash. Not a single euro more. Forget about "I want 1 bitcoin, or 0.5", just folow the rule above (and below).  
And no, no bank loans. Burry that idea forever.

Exactly, you can watch the stars naked on a pile of dirt and wonder.

Maybe you should, but you definitely can't :)

What environnement, you mean the market? As in "if only everybody would just hold on to their bags forever it would mewn :("? It doesn't take so much knowledge to protect yourself form the losses and buy at a favorable time, such as not in a yearly down trend for instance. And no, retail investors hodling wont make any difference, the cycles of up and down trends happen with just the right amount to push the first domino. Hodler will always be cought in the middle, no matter what.

The other greatest ignorance would be to accept something you know nothing about.
Conclusion, learn about it or move along.

Maybe consider selling a wee bit, you know, at =&gt; **major resistance** &lt;= \*wink wink\*  
Or do whatever and just hodl it all for life, just saying :)

Hodlers "buying pressure" aka FOMO makes close to no difference long term and will mainly just vanish into profits fort shorts / sellers. Traders are what make a market alive and moving (both directions), a market made of hodlers makes no sense on an economical level. That's the difference between a ponzy and a real thing. 
If someone wants to invest long term in this space, they need to buy accordingly to market cycles and trend. And most importantly have a plan for both scenario (up and down) in order to protect themselves. Wishful thinking won't save anybody from their ill-informed choices.

Sorry your comment is all over the place stating one thing and the opposite, so I'm not sure if you're sincere or just slighly trolling. What I'm saying regarding this topic is to learn risk management if that wasn't clear enough. Of course nobody knows where and when the bottom of a trend happens, so when you want to invest you first come with a plan of what you're willing to lose and stick to it:
Is it less than my threshold? Yes &gt; ok then I'm still in. No &gt; Alright fair enough I'm out.
No sweating for your life, only planned actions.
