That's a straight up scam, they could take some of that money we paid for the contract and paid the fees with that on 3 ths or 2ths but they deleted the whole thing and our money is now in their pockets. SCAM.

but the price is atrocious compared to hashing 24 no ? I purchased 4th on 24 for 900 euro, its more than double on Genesis.

fake account with one comment recommends site that's number one on google despite being less good than hashing 24 and number 1 on the number one review site on google... totally not an SEO scam.

Except it's a new phone and a new battery and I got the exact same bugs I had on the old one, bugs that only appeared with usage. 
To be specific:
- mistyped letters when typing fast (used to be perfect)
- lag in closing an app (used to be instant)
- failure of phone to register certain touches (never happened in '16)
- delayed response to certain touches
Just enough to make it feel "dated".

Dude you're about to get your wish and no death required. With all the minners turning around to sell used card the price will crash in 1 year. Nvidia knows this and they are very upset about it.

I often do run 2 older ones, it's a bit more power intensive but it works real well for cheap :)

Think it's the soft that's updated for the new models or just on purpose ? Or do they age in the box ?

Hum actually i don't think it damages the cards a lot. there's a linuxtechtips on this very subject (with other stress related usages than mining admiteldy) and they were surprised by the lack of degradation over time. 
The conclusions is that yes, the cards will eventually fail, but until they do there's no linear loss of power. There's an initial drop off after a while (a month) and then it's stable for a long time. 
People expect severe performance degradation for cards because of their experience with Windows and Apple but Windows degrades because it's too open and settings / services / drivers get fucked and apple (as far as I can tell) degrades because it's programmed to do so (I bought an iphone 6 thinking I was so clever for 300$ brand new a few months ago, and it had the same age related problems as my other iphone 6 i'd had for 3 years... i know it sounds conspiratorial but I really really think apple does it.)
The cards makers don't build that into their cards they want as few fails as possible in the warranty period of 2 years and that means most cards last well past their useful period. (statistically, it means the bulk of failure is past the 2 year mark, which if you know the normal distribution means it's stretching into the 5 to 6 years for the long life cards (25% upper).

Well that's because the other currencies belong to people who ensure they are very hard to launder (at least for poor people)... Bitcoin is easy to launder for everyone. Can't let the little people build capital it would ruin the system :)

it's not "not profitable" it's gone.
