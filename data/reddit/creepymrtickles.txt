Dude, I put my bitcoin and altcoins on a hardware wallet in a safe. I don't even look at the exchange anymore. It was money I could afford to lose. Now it sits, fluctuating in value, come what may, let chance at it.

Blow me away? Like in a drone strike? US drones its own citizens abroad. 
Nah but seriously good luck. I hope you make it into a success!

This is not a general cryptocurrency sub. That already exists. It's a bitcoin sub.

There is no way for Beijing to micromanage something as large as China. These institutions are largely autonomous, they only follow some very general rules, usually pertaining to very general, open ended goals that need to be met by so and so date. Incentives are provided for fulfilling such goals, there is no punishment for failing to hit the mark.
Think of China as a decentralized Imperial regime, ruled by a board of directors. The only centralized element is the people's liberation army which includes the navy and air force; and the communist party central bureaucracy. Those have little to do with the banks. Even the Central bank does its own thing, unless directed otherwise by the politburo, which is unlikely outside of Yuan currency controls. 
Of the Politburo, Chinese president for life included, I doubt that anybody has even heard about bitcoin in any detail.

When the Bureaucracy is this large (larger than that of the EU/US/South America combined) delegation is king. If somebody is appointed to lead a bank, they are the final say in 95% of circumstances. This is why corruption became rampant and had to be stamped out, there were mayors, provincial governors and banksters who created their own little fiefdoms under the nose of Beijing. That high profile scenario where the police commissioner/Mayor of Chongqing (a city/metro region of just 30 million) became the most powerful man in China is one example. He had tens of thousands of policemen doing his personal political bidding, and was getting ready to extort his way into the Politburo. Beijing noticed and cut him down.

The US government records the phone conversations of every German, and abducts people from European cities. 
It can abduct you on the Streets of Amsterdam and put you in a Polish CIA black site. You will simply be marked as 'missing' by the authorities.

Recall what happened to those 'anonymous' Swiss bank accounts when the US said jump and when Switzerland asked 'how high?'.
