Mine alt coins, you could make a modest gain. Specifically look for non-ASIC coins. BTC is not profitable because of mining farms

Market makers wont make it that easy on the derivatives markets. Otherwise everyone would just long on leverage during bull markets (and become billionaires). The sudden drop tactics cause liquidations which provides new entry points and liquidity to the derivatives market.
If you zoom out,  Bitcoin looks as healthy as ever this year.

Most people don't realize this. Market sentiment is Bitcoin is dead lol
Sure no one knows how much further down it goes or for how long it stays bear. But to think we won't hit all time highs again *eventually, is nuts. Couldn't agree more

lol, Time will tell. 
Yall are no different  than the boy who cried wolf. Y'all have been saying bitcoins dead for 10 years now. But let me guess, 'this time is different'. Okay we'll see

Bitcoin cash is suspect. Basically a Chevy Tahoe claiming to be an Cadillac Escalade. Sure the body frame is the same but the brand &amp; customer sentiment is very different.

Immutability &gt; Scalability  . 
People complain about speed, not being able to increase block sizes, how impossible it is to make protocol level changes etc. However they can't complain about BTC's immutability and that is fine by me.
