Party is arrested and imprisoned for a stupid stunt. enjoys the endless material.

If you think simply being an enthusiast for a certain type of tech makes you a strong man, you are a weak man. 
That is the type of thought that could only be considered during good times.

How are you this uninformed?
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:20:25
You must not have much of a life if you aren't even familiar with basic tax rules that anyone with a career and investments would be familiar with.

Why is it that the only people stupid enough to pay th we types of Bank fees are the same people who support Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:54:28
I have never had a problem sending or receiving money through my banks and credit unions. Even my annual bonus check can be deposited by my phone. The only fee I've ever had to pay for my current banks and credit unions are the one time $5 membership fees for the credit unions. 
How much money are you sending and receiving that bank transfer fees are problems?

A credit card isn't your money. It is a loan. Would you loan someone else money so they could buy cryptocurrency?

That was a lucky time to exit. I bought some with my fun money just below $10k, but sold between $17k and $11k, ended up only making a little over $100.

How much cash do you hold? What percentage of your net worth are you holding in cash? If inflation is impacting your net worth substantially you need to rethink your investments.

Do you not have money invested in the bond or stock market?

I'd much rather have a growing economy than a horde of cash under my bed. It is working out fine for me, so I don't need to invent conspiracies to explain why I'm being oppressed. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:46:35
If that is what you are taking away from that, you don't yet have a developed understanding of finance. Cash is not supposed to hold value. It is not ideal for people to horde cash, controlled inflation is desired in order to spur investment and lending. 
You should only be keeping your emergency fund and shirt term savings in cash. @_date: 2018-02-05 20:07:44
A credit card is not your money, it is a line of credit.
@_date: 2018-12-17 09:05:16
You think I don't know what my cards pay? My USAA pays 2.5% on everything, my other Visa pays 5% on Amazon. Additionally, I sign up for about two cards a year for the sign up bonus. I've made $250 extra the past three months in sign up bonuses for two cards.
And again, I'd be paying those absorbed merchant fees anyways, so I don't see what point you're trying to make. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:25:41
Lol. You say that like you think I don't know it. I would have paid that anyways had I used cash, debit, or crypto, just as everyone does. Having good credit and managing my cards allows me to get the cash back rewards, which I wouldn't get otherwise. Also, you're way overestimating card servicing fees if you peg them at 12% of price.

I don't know why you think Bitcoin protects you from that. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:02:37
Or that same central authority could just detain you until you transfer your Bitcoin.

Saying one race of people is inferior to the other and should be exterminated, for example. Do you disagree?
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:48:44
I have 11k in cash at Ally and USAA and 94k spread around my 401(k)s, TSP, and Vanguard IRA. Also 500 on my flex spending account and 180 in Motif. 
I'm not at all worried about posting that.
Is Bitcoin really more secure?
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:15:36
I don't need to, nor would any central authority. They could simply detain you until receiving what they want.
Crypto doesn't protect anyone from a dystopian authoritarian state.  The good news is that such a future is unlikely to happen. That's why I am not worried about my retirement accounts or cash being seized. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:25:11
Bitcoin doesn't pay dividends. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:22:38
Why? I have no qualms about sharing how much money o have.

I've averaged over $400/yr in cash back rewards over the past five years with my credit cards, all while never paying a fee or a cent of interest. Credit cards with zero user fees are the best way to purchase things if you can manage your spending.

We got our orders from the Bogdanoffs, we executed them, and the price moved exactly as planned. Simple market to manipulate. What's tough is pallidium and frozen concentrated orange juice futures. Those guys have it tough and usually have to work weekends.

When you say stuff like this normal people know to discount you. Whether or not you believe hate speech should be legal doesn't negate the fact that it exists and private individuals and companies can choose not to support it.
