In one scenario (a low interest home loan from a bank) you have one monthly outlay for housing, your mortgage payment. In the other scenario (where banks don't exist) you have two outlays for housing, your monthly rent and your money you have to set aside to save for a home. 
Saving for a home while also paying a landlord rent is grossly inefficient from a financial point of view. Same thing with any other large purchases. If you can get loan with an interest rate at or below inflation levels it is an amazing tool and a great boon to the middle class.

It's not just the security of the wallet software itself. A minor error in a bitcoin transaction (or having malware on your PC) can permanently lose your assets. Type the wrong letter on a bitcoin address, scan the wrong QR code, type the wrong email address, etc...

Euros are vastly superior to bitcoin for their needs. Stores accept Euro as a form of payment for example.

It's like you aren't getting that Euros and/or USD in cash form are more useful than bitcoin to Greeks. They are also more availiable, easier to obtain, and have people willing to accept them as payment. I know you want to believe that bitcoin is the perfect solution to their problem, but the country isn't ready for it.

You still have to pay the transfer fee to send the coin to Bitreserve.

The problem is that basically zero people in Greece are willing to accept bitcoin as a form of payment. Sure, Greeks can buy bitcoin, but it is much less useful to them than the cash Euros they spent to get it.

If the amount of money coinbase (or any other vendor) is losing due to scams goes up, the fees for their services go up. Just like any other company, they exist to make a profit and are not going to just eat losses.
When you have a 100% **irreversible** product like bitcoin, and you are letting people buy it with a reversable payment method, you need to be extremely careful and err on the side of caution in most cases.

To the average Joe who wants to get into bitcoin and spend them at mainstream businesses they are the same thing. When he goes to recommended place to buy bitcoins(Coinbase) he has to pay over market price plus their fee.

Wow, no need to be so nasty.
I was simply propositioning that buying bitcoins to spend at a store who just converts them back into USD isn't really a benefit for anyone besides people who already own bitcoin. It solves no problems. Unless using bitcoins provides a tangible and substantial advantage over using traditional forms of payment we won't see use cases like this drive mass adoption (which was my main point and what this discussion was about, driving new adoption).
I think that is a fair opinion, and that it is fair to voice it, in a **discussion** forum.

Running a full node requires a full copy of the blockchain. I've seen estimates that if Bitcoin ever gets wide acceptance we could be adding as much as a gigabyte a minute to the block chain. This would require Terabytes worth of SSDs (platter drives wouldn't be fast enough) added daily for each node. That was my concern, the processing power isn't that intensive. I agree though, this isn't an immediate concern so much as a concern 10 years from now.

There are ways to make money on a market both when it is rising and when it is falling. Shorting is a way to make money on a falling market.

Since bitcoin transactions are irreversible coinbase needs to be **absolutely** sure they have their money before they send the coins. That's the reason for them using the 3-5 day ACH system and making you go through hoops to use their instant transfer. If they didn't use these systems they would get taken advantage of by scammers.
The fact that you didn't have coins when you needed them is your own fault, not coinbases.

"Free" web wallets will most likely be tied to a service like coinbase or bitpay just as "free" banking accounts are tied to credit unions and banks.

That 70% is not all in one asset though.
Imagine it this way. Total global wealth is around $240 trillion, lets say bitcoin is the singular currency in the world and all of them have been mined. This would put the value of one bitcoin at $11,428,571.43. The 950 people who own the top 50% would have 11,052.63 bitcoins each. The rest of us would have, on average, .0015 bitcoins each. Think about how a bitcoin exchange would function with those numbers, the top holders could drive the value on a whim. This is already happening right now on the markets, more users and increasing prices for bitcoin will just exponentiate what we are currently seeing. The higher the price, the more dangerous these guys holding the huge amounts become.

There is a difference between voicing legitimate concerns and trolling. All kinds of successful companies have people making complaints about them, do you think these opinions are invalid?

If I take a bitcoin payment I need to collect and pay the applicable tax for that purchase and then keep track of the exact amount of bitcoin received, when it was received, and exactly how much it appreciated or depreciated by the time I liquidate it.

That's not how finance works. Millionaires don't barter gold with bonds. They liquify their assets into USD and then reinvest into the new asset.

Higher fees for the consumer, usually incurred when purchasing the bitcoin in the first place.
Higher risk of **permanent** loss through theft (If my debit card is stolen I am not liable for anything). Also, zero fraud protection. 
Uncertain laws and regulations surrounding bitcoin that make financial planning difficult.
Wild swings in value changing the purchasing power of your coins.
Bitcoin is difficult to spend compared to cash and credit/debit cards. You need to own a smartphone with internet access to do so in person, and the vendors who actually accept the coin are extremely limited. Using fiat, to convert to bitcoins, to convert to gift cards, is retarded so don't bother using that excuse.
Most current credit/debit cards offer cashback or rewards, bitcoin doesn't.
You can use credit cards as short term loans if you need the money, bitcoin doesn't offer this.
Using credit cards and loans builds your credit history/rating which makes borrowing money at good interest rates easy when you want to take out a home loan, using bitcoin does nothing for you.

Bitcoin is on that path too. The escalating costs of mining equipment (that is actually productive) will make mining the first to centralize. The rapid growth in the blockchain will make running full nodes the next to go once storage and processing costs are no longer in reach of the average Joe. After that it is a very short step to major processors controlling the nodes and running the majority of transactions off-chain. If the majority of the nodes are held by major processors they could even deny any transactions that are not made through them. Not saying it will happen, but it could. Never underestimate greed in people who hold power.

I don't know. I just read the story and it didn't imply that your brother was a criminal.
Yes, they posted some facts and quoted some sources that showed bitcoin in a negative light (which, lets be honest here, were not made up). But they also used a quote from the Bitcoin Foundation that was "bitcoin positive", provided a bunch of pro-bitcoin links at the end of the article, and used your brothers business as an example of non-criminal bitcoin activity.
Overall, I think the article was kind of a mixed bag. Maybe the reporter should have informed your brother that the piece wasn't going to be explicitly pro-bitcoin though since his business was involved.

We are still climbing out of a recession and most likely will not immediately relapse into another one. As the economy continues to strengthen, gold will probably continue to lose value until it falls to a more reasonable level. The only reason it rocketed up that high in the first place was people divesting from other investments during the recession and putting it in gold because it was "safe". If there is no recession, and we have bullish markets, gold really isn't that great of an investment since it won't gain value. People will move their money out of gold to take advantage of better opportunities. This has already been happening and why we are seeing gold hemorrhage its value.

If you mine $1000 worth of bitcoin then you pay tax on it the same way a gold miner has to pay tax on profits from mining. After that it is treated the same as any other asset and you have to pay taxes on investment gains. If you buy stocks you need to keep track of the date you bought them and calculate any gains you make during the year. You can also declare investment losses for tax credit.
I'm not sure what you were expecting the tax office to announce, but them making bitcoin a tax-free investment will never happen.

The cognitive dissonance in here is amazing. People don't realize that regulation is what prevents situations like the financial crisis from happening, that's why big banks hate regulation so much and spend so much money lobbying politicians trying to prevent it.
Bitcoin regulation is the same thing, it is aimed at preventing scenarios that would lead to customers getting screwed over. It is protecting the customers by limiting the risky behavior that is allowed to happen.

If there are a variety of options for secure "free" bitcoin banking, people won't have to (or want to) use shady third party wallets from anonymous people overseas.

Bitcoin will only become less inflationary than fiat, on average, after 2021.
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:40:01
Think about the big expenditures that occur during the life of a middle class adult and how the economy of a deflationary currency would affect them. Sure, for day to day things there would be little difference, I agree.
Home buying would be a nightmare. You could either save up enough money to buy a home outright (while probably also paying rent, which is inefficient since you are effectively budgeting for 2 housing allocations), or you could take out a loan.
Taking out a large loan of a deflationary currency is punitive to the borrower in multiple ways. Firstly, the amount you owe effectively increases every year as each of the currency units you owe become more valuable. Secondly, you would still have interest rates punishing you on top of the money you are losing due to inflation, these would act together in a compound manner. Thirdly, all else being equal, your wages would decrease each year as the currency becomes more valuable, so you would have less currency units per year to pay off your debt.
Home loans are the biggest expenditure middle class families will face, but the effect would be the same on all big purchases where credit is needed (Vehicles, Student Loans, etc.)
The other side of this is that inflation is good for people who carry debt. If you have a home loan at 4% interest, and the inflation rate for the year is 4%, then effectively its a "free" loan. Giving the middle class access to cheap credit like that spurs the economy. However, letting banks give out tons of shitty loans to people who can't pay them back is very dangerous.

There are ideological "advantages", but realistically, 99.99% of consumers couldn't possibly care less about them.
If bitcoin is going to ever go mainstream it needs to be so seamlessly integrated into the current payment systems people don't even realize they are using it. Bitcoin is too volatile to be a good store of value and it's too cumbersome to be a widely used payment system.

The actual infrastructure of the current banking system is fine and works incredibly well for the vast majority of people, its not obsolete. There are tons of options and money moves around incredibly reliably and relatively smoothly between accounts and institutions. 
The crash was a whole different matter that was unrelated to the infrastructure. It was a lack of regulation of banks behavior. The banks should never have been allowed to use their investor's assets in such a irresponsible and risky way.
That said, bitcoin provides some amazing new options and technology that didn't exist before. I'm positive that a lot of people will see the value in it and jump on board. My original point though is that there will be a large percentage of people who don't care and will just stick to the current system, which is fine, they have every right to do so. There is plenty of room for both and with companies like Coinbase and Circle they interact together relatively seamlessly.

I think that current banking systems aren't set in stone. If bitcoin provides enough advantages that everyone in the world is going to switch over, banks will evolve to keep their market share. They won't just sit there and die out. I also think that, in general, the population is pretty apathetic when it comes to real change and that the current system is "good enough" for most people. There is room for both systems, both systems have their advantages and disadvantages, and anyone is free to choose whichever they want to use. I think that's the path of least resistance.

You keep assuming things. If miners expect a huge increase in bitcoin price in the future they may very well keep mining. We have already seen a ton of people mining when it would have been just as profitable to take their mining cost and just buy bitcoin with it in the first place. Emotions are involved, it isn't 100% pure logic. The only things that are for certain is that the reward is going to halve and that the miner's expenses are very likely going to remain the same.

The consumer protection doesn't come from Apple.

With bitcoin there is absolutely zero recourse for consumers who get scammed or are otherwise unhappy with their purchase/service.

If you have something that is worth $100 and you sell it for $80 and a 30c transaction fee, the cost to you is more than 30c.

I disagree. In an economy with inflationary currency, the inflation saps wealth from the people who hold the money and lessens the debt burden of the people who carry the loan as the currency units they owe are worth less each year.

It's normal for people want to realize a profit on their investments. If I knew bitcoin prices would continue downward for the next year I would probably pull out and invest in something else. Any time your money is not gaining value you potentially lose a lot, over time, due to how compound interest works. 
This year, for example, has been pretty poor for holding bitcoin (-40% YTD) while the traditional stock market has been very profitable. People would have been better off this year pulling out of bitcoin, investing that money in the stock market, and reinvesting in bitcoin at a later date. Hindsight is 20/20 though.

For all of the libertarian people who got into bitcoin for the purpose of disconnecting from the "evil government fiat" system, their dreams have been realized.  Bitcoin is here and it isn't going anywhere, and due to its nature it will probably be around forever.
Absolutely anyone can divest everything they own and put it into bitcoin, **if they want to**. There are all kinds of services and systems available, right now, so these people can use, transfer, spend, or convert their bitcoins at will.
However, 95% of the population is perfectly happy sticking with the traditional financial system. If these people ever want to switch, bitcoin will be an option they can use. 
Bitcoin isn't going to be all-or-nothing. It isn't going to disappear and it isn't going to take over the world, put the banks out of business, and destroy governments. It will be a niche market in the global financial system that people use when they have the need or want for a system like it.

You should probably read the entire article. Your post is a perfect example of Confirmation Bias however. 
"Confirmation bias, also called myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, or prioritize information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position."

Regular users (average people, if bitcoin goes mainstream) aren't going to want to have separate offline computers coupled with multiple layers of security. They would just continue using their credit/debit cards and traditional banking accounts.

This would still allow consumers and businesses to do instant transfers without a middleman. It would provide USD banking capabilities to the unbanked like bitcoin does. It would also provide consumers a way to shop online without providing their banking/credit information.

No, it only defeats some of the benefits from the libertarian point of view. It would provide most of the other benefits of a digital cash that can be transferred around safely without using banks and payment processors.

Yes, clearly you must be right. When the block rewards get cut in half, the miners costs will still equal the same amount of bitcoin return.
Look, there is no guarantee that the price will do anything. The only thing guaranteed is that the miners expenses will remain the same(as long as they keep doing what they are doing) and that their reward will be cut in half.

This is true, however, I think that saving for a home while also making rent payments is very costly and inefficient. You are effectively paying twice for housing. A low interest rate loan in an inflationary currency is an incredible tool for the middle class.

If the entire economy were to switch over to a deflationary currency, like bitcoin, it would cause massive problems in some areas. Imagine taking out a home loan where the amount you owe increases each year due to the rising value of bitcoin. It would be like borrowing 5,000 bitcoins from someone three years ago when the value was $1 and then trying to pay them back their 5,000 bitcoins now they are worth $265. You borrowed $5,000 in value and now you owe them $1,325,000 in value. It would be less extreme, but the same principal applies.

All else being equal, the amount of incoming fiat it takes to raise the bitcoin price from .01 to $10 is orders of magnitude lower than the amount of fiat it takes to raise the price from $100 to $1000.

Foreclosure and Eviction is a nightmare from the point of view of a bank. They don't want to lend money to people who don't have the capability to pay it back.

Complete freedom has both positive and negative aspects. That's the reality of a system like bitcoin.

If there are unfavorable regulations in one area there is nothing stopping a competitor from opening up shop in a location with more favorable regulation.

It is a fallacy because the consequences are completely different.
If you have your credit card number stolen, your credit card company will put a hold on the card and send you a new one. You are not liable for any of the fraudulent activity and all of your assets are protected.
If your bitcoin is stolen, you lose all compromised assets and have zero recourse. There is no way to get your money back, you take 100% of the loss.

**edit:** Since there is apparently a lot of confusion here in on how the FDIC works.
All FDIC insured banks and credit unions pay insurance premiums to the FDIC on their deposits. This money, and the interest the FDIC collects on its investments, pays off the depositors in the event of bank failure.
When the FDIC pays off investors the money does not come from new funds issued from the federal reserve and the money is not collected from tax payers.

Remember folks, when a bitcoin startup or ATM charges fees, it's a perfectly justifiable cost of their service.
When companies like Western Union charge a 5-10% fee they are literally the devil and enabling slavery.

They don't need us all to comply. Mining is becoming so centralized that the government just needs the big players in the mining game to not process transactions that involve coins on their blacklist. They could use a number of techniques to pressure miners into complying such as fines and/or jail time for "facilitating money laundering".

It's not necessarily about regulation.
Visa/MasterCard have shown they are willing to suspend services and apply pressure at the behest of the government, even if nothing illegal is going on. Visa/MC/paypal/Banks/etc. suspending services to Coinbase/Circle/Exchanges/etc. isn't that far of a stretch unfortunately and it would have a massive negative impact on the usability of bitcoin.

Well, with fiat, you are covered by FDIC insurance (or the equivalent) so you don't actually lose any money. All of the major credit cards cover you in the event of fraud or theft also. Probably going to get a lot of hate for this comment but it's true.

False equivalence is a logical fallacy which describes a situation where there is a logical and apparent equivalence, but when in fact there is none.
A common way for this fallacy to be perpetuated is one shared trait between two subjects is assumed to show equivalence, especially in order of magnitude, when equivalence is not necessarily the logical result. False equivalence is a common result when an anecdotal similarity is pointed out as equal, but the claim of equivalence doesn't bear because the similarity is based on oversimplification or ignorance of additional factors.

Policing serial numbers on dollar bills is basically impossible. 
Developing a bitcoin tracker and sending bitpay, coinbase, and the major exchanges, a list of bitcoins that are blacklisted would be fairly easy.

We are already seeing a lot of transactions moving "off chain". Now, if the transactions fees are going to rise sharply enough to pay for all of the network maintenance, we will probably see even more activity migrating away from the block chain.

I suppose it would be possible to access the cash box inside the ATM and then just use the cash over and over to buy bitcoin from the machine.

People who use bitcoin also need to trust the large mining pool operators to operate in a responsible manner. That is faith in  people's behavior, not math.

FDIC insured banks pay insurance premiums to the FDIC on all of their deposits. It's just like any other insurance company.
Banks generate revenue via loans and financial services. The insurance premiums are paid out of these revenues. They don't take money from peoples accounts.

Those guys were the big players in bitcoin at the time and it was completely justifiable to include them. A documentary should ideally be an unbiased document of what was going on during a certain time. If you want to make a film and cherry-pick only the positive aspects of your subject to include, that falls more along the lines of propaganda or advertisement.
If you were to make a documentary right now, there are still a bunch of negative aspects and bad players in the bitcoin ecosystem. The silkroad auctions are still taking place, Gox is still unresolved, GAW, etc., and not including them in some way would be disingenuous.

It would still have the benefits of a digital cash (buying things online without having your identity stolen, the ability to provide digital banking to the masses, etc.), and there would be no volatility which would make it much more attractive for businesses to accept.

They aren't alternative currencies, they are dollars. When you buy a gift card you pay in dollars, those dollars are then held by the retailer in their books until they are redeemed for merchandise at a later time. It is all accounted for financially and for tax purposes as dollars.
