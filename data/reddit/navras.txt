I prefer financial freedom over toys. That same amount of money can buy you a Tesla AND years of vacation. It can also be invested so it can buy long term wealth too. To each his own.

Same. Terrible investment. Easily devalues the moment you’re out on the road. Easy to get impacted by some random car.
