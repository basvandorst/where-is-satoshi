I'll reply to myself, simpler, blockchain is becoming too unstable. Whacked up the sat/byte to very high level as needed a transaction through relatively quickly based on realtime fee monitoring. Then it moved and now in the 250+sat/byte range, transaction does not even have one confirmation after nearly 2hrs, the term insanity really does not do the opaqueness justice. I'm going down the pub, much more intelligent idea than waiting for this nonsense.

I know, fee bumping, found another approach which works better.

Technically it's not a flaw, but contextually it is. Fully understand your detailed reply, but an auction allows you to bid higher as the market moves, in this case your fee is fixed and cannot be updated. Using your analogy it is a sealed bid auction, which has many inherent flaws for everyone except the miner due to lack of transparency.
 
Sealed bids work when selling a Picasso, they don't work so well on day to day transactions.

Very nice, no, I don't need insight, just a simple point about the how the blockchain network functions and the inherent problem with honoring transactions, knowledge is power.

Nada, nice service for their 1% fee and deposit fee.

10hours so far and no reply from their support, lovely.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:31:14
Depends if you're looking at it from the miners perspective or the senders perspective. This sealed bid approach makes the whole blockchain network unsuitable for commodity items and/or if there is a time element involved. We're hedging and it makes everything many times more complex than it needs to be, a 60minute delay and x% price move do not go together very well, have worked around it but we know what we're doing. The banks will not play nicely when they figure out this 'design' approach.

One of the traders using the system I have access to made 300% return earlier in the year, haven't lost any, I'm trying to raise funds as have access to their platform being a developer with the signals the fund managers receive, they upgraded the tech to 300%-500%. Do know a couple of investors who lost 30% or so by hesistating investing so the funds could not be hedged, and another who bought at $13k which is now 50% loss.

Already have the password, only do not have the domain for the verification email.
@_date: 2018-05-11 07:05:00
Received a response from their support, it's very vague, doesn't answer the question, and hedged around providing a remedy. I'm starting to believe they have some sort of back door in to the wallets in these situations, if you have the passphrase there is no need for email validation.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:30:38
It appears no one has any answers, I presume they calculate by hand or just take a gamble, knowingly or not. It's not exactly 21st century.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:21:16
Fascinating, many thanks for the information.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:01:08
Thanks for the insights, but that's the problem, "I know users with $50-100k daily withdrawal limits." but has anyone actually ever done it, once I see is possible, but every month, what happens then, I can imagine the receiving banks getting uncomfortable, how do you go about proving you made it speculating.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:49:28
That's not the answer your support gave when asked, so what is the estimated interest rate on a 100BTCUSD (XBTUSD) Short for one year. You are implying with futures that you can go Short 100BTCUSD (XBTUSD) with 1BTC margin, which means there have to be rollovers but your site only provides examples of Swaps not of Futures trades, where are the expirations. No need to be rude, we did read the exchange documentation, it's as clear as mud.

On latest Version97, no fee choice.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:28:15
That's all very nice but everyone wants to get paid, one way or another. Given it's taken this long to place what anyone would class as "fundamental functionality" in the app which I still don't have, there are some "behind the scenes" actions going on, but am not particularly interested.
Personally I don't accept 12% fees as the recommendation (noticing you don't list the percentage), fortunately you'll have 1,000s of others who don't get it, hardware all the way. As long as the customer doesn't know why they're "pissed off" nothing material needs to change.

So basically you have to go through an exchange with some trust but smaller amounts over the long term or do it peer-to-peer with no trust but can go higher amounts long term.
Say I made $500k profit from the Bitcoin price move, how do I cash that out over a 1-2year period each month. Any suggestions on the process as have found lots of theories but no real examples.

Ledger is good but you can tell it's French, some of the choices are just a bit odd, if you can wait the Trezor T seems to be on another level. Haven't tried the normal Trezor, Ledger was quicker to order with less hassle but you wouldn't go wrong with either.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:41:54
I agree, why hasn't someone forked Breadwallet and added a simple advanced dropdown on the pre-confirmation allowing a few options plus complete manual override, covering all three types of user. The developer obviously has some agenda otherwise they would have done it, does it keep the fees artificially high for the miners.
Update: Found it, 'He estimates miners, in total, were rewarded with 1,800 bitcoins, or $7 million.' noting "That's going to about five to 10 companies," Lasher said,  Some would suspect the wallet makers are in on this given their lack of fee transparency, and if you don't have top level security you're on your own, definitely a Trezor or Ledger.
So no non-hardware wallets with high grade security *and* fee transparency, never a good sign, just as well I ordered a Ledger then.
Update: Now Breadwallet is asking $2.98 for a $18 transaction with no fee option, that's insane. Another fixed fee wallet is quoting 1250bits for the same transaction, it's not a stretch of the imagination to believe they joined forces to push the fees higher, the wallets probably get some sort of kickback.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:07:00
Well that's not very polite, I am fully aware how the fee system works in Bitcoin, no need to be condescending unless I hit a nerve somewhere. Transparency always beats opaque.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:19:25
I have nothing against you nor your product, Breadwallet appears to be one of the most secure wallet apps, however it is also one of the weakest on fee transparency. We run a Bitcoin denominated fund, finding microscopic flaws in entities magnitudes larger than the Bitcoin network due to lack of transparency, it's very profitable and we're very good at it. A suggestion, create a Breadwallet+ showing estimated timeframe confirmations such as 5mn, 15mn, 1hr, 4hr, 1dy with a full custom option for $20 or $40, you would be surprised how much people are willing to pay to make their own choices, myself included.

They only just updated the Android version of Breadwallet today, but it is more useless that the previous version. I'll order another Ledger today, -21% Black Friday deal, the moment I delete this app it will be a happy moment.
Here are some points on the new version.
* If updating you have to make the password to 6digits, but it obscures the numbers, you can enter them in twice to confirm and never know you made a mistake.
* When you enter in the bits to send, you have to manually change to USD to see the fiat amount, but it keeps the amount the same, let's guess how many people will enter in 5000Bits, press the USD button to see the currency amount and hit send transferring 5,000USD in to the electronic ether.
* The interesting part for me, the Economy fee is 1/15th of Normal, the term insanity does not do it justice, there is something hidden in the background of all this to push people to high fees.
None of these wallets have adverts and they do not charge, so *how* do they earn income from it because they are not doing it for free.
I made a test transaction of $5 with 339Bits/$2.77 as fee on 160sat/byte taking 15minutes for first confirmation, the Economy stated $0.18. Then resent the remaining $3.52 back to origin with 80sat/byte which when actioned booked as 93sat/byte, funny how it's never lower, still confirming, now what would that time be with $0.18 as the fee, eternity perhaps.
The foundation of Bitcoin is sound with Blockchain, but when you get people involved they always find a way to "ponzi" it, the Bitcoin fee system doesn't seem to be any different from what it is trying to replace, with the wallets being the equivalent of the credit card processors, everyone wants their cut of the transaction, visible or not.

No grey pencil, quoting $2.19 for $18, daylight robbery. My advice for anyone using Bitcoin, go hardware, you seem to get exactly what you pay for with free or low cost wallets.
