Personally I do not care whether btc is good or bad as a technology. I am a trader of securities and goods and for me btc is a wonderful opportunity to make a lot of profit by going short on it.
When the trend reverses I will have no problem to go long on btc.
MAYBE FOR YOU BTC GUYS THIS IS BULLSHIT, but for now, the price fall is a SURE BET.

Bitcoin is a falling knife, only blind people cannot see that!
“Never try to catch a falling knife” (Wall Street proverb)
"Never try to catch a falling knife” (or “Don’t catch a falling knife") means that when a stock is in free-fall, let it continue to go down and reach bottom. Trying to—often inaccurately—guess the bottom price of the stock is often like trying to catch a falling knife. (It’s bloody.) The expression is an old one but appears to have been applied to Wall Street in the mid-1980s. 
Another, similar expression is: “Never catch a falling safe.” This expression also seems to have been applied to the stock market in the mid-1980s. Both expressions are used today, but the “fallling knife” expression is more popular than the “falling safe.” 
Investopedia 
Falling Knife 
 A slang phrase for a security or industry in which the current price or value has dropped significantly in a short period of time. A falling knife security can rebound, or it can lose all of its value, such as in the case of company bankruptcy where equity shares become worthless.  
 A falling knife situation can occur because of actual business results (such as a big drop in net earnings) or because of increasingly negative investor sentiment.  
 As the phrase suggests, buying into a market with a lot of downward momentum can be quite dangerous. If timed perfectly, a buy at the bottom of a long downtrend can be rewarding - both financially and emotionally - but the risks run extremely high. This term implies that the investment will never be a good one again. Examples of stocks that have plummeted are plentiful; a widely-held stock can drop precipitously as the equity ownership is reduced to nothing.
