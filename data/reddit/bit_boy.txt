I was watching the 1 week candle chart on bitcoinwisdom, saw the ATH change live to 2017 instead of 2013, what a great moment!

I don't remember doing that...

I just updated my coins to a Trezor. You can use a pin code to access, and for security you have to wait a longer and longer time to enter it after each wrong entry, quite cool. You can have regular accounts and ones hidden behind a passphrase, which is what I've done. I'm waiting on a Cryptosteel to store the passphrase. I got a Ledger for a friend, seems more geared towards the mainstream, whereas Trezor is a bit more for the hardcore :)

A possibility....

Thanks for this

Do you have to sign up with Coinbase or can you use your own Bitcoin address? thanks

The stochRSI is very low for all longer timeframes except 1 day and 3 days, when they hits bottom (soon), expect moon.

I would be interested in buying something like this if it's for sale...

They tried to get the last block by getting a head start, didn't work tho!
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:17:01
LOL this needs to be added

This is the type of thing that moved me to Mycelium...

Bitcoinwisdom, if you look at all the longer timeframes, 1 week, 3 days, 1 day etc. they are all near the bottom, a bit more sideways action I think then moon :)
