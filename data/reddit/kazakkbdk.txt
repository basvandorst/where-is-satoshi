If this is true, I hope the slowest and most painful death ever imaginable to each one of these motherfuckers. I dream of the day I take my own gun and die defending myself from the state whores, getting many of them too.

I am aware of the dangers of leaving your bitcoin on an exchange but I'm very scared of moving my bitcoins to a wallet/cold wallet myself. Even if I format my computer or even buy a new computer just for that I fear that I'm always being watched

I actually did sell at 20k, just a few hours before the crash started. However, I did a newbie trader's mistake and bought while it was still falling, at 14k.
My method of predicting the crash is to be constantly vigilant and asking if whether or not the current situation of Bitcoin makes it for the price. When Bitcoin was at 20k, it was in a bad position, with lots of bad news and a very high transaction fee. It had more reasons to go down than go up.
Next time, I'm not buying back while it's still dropping, and I'll multiply my bitcoins.

K then.
$1000000 by the end of 2022.
It's not that optimistic really.

I have a legit newbie question that makes me feel a bit stupid.
I want to move my bitcoins out of my exchange to a cold wallet, but I'm scared AF that something goes wrong. I've never moved bitcoins before. How do I do that in the most secure way possible? I might move a small amount first to test it.
I intend to move my bitcoins to a cold wallet and in a year or more into Binance, to do trading. My country is threatening all exchanges here to give up all user information so they can tax us 32,5% of all our profits (even if we had taken losses before).
