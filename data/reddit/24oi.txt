Or from a middle eastern country that has a problem with exporting trained terrorists and whose government will not provide ours with the criminal records we need to properly vet them and allow their entry? Something Saudi Arabia and Pakistan do.

Umm...pretty sure those are 100% NOT United States citizens.

Thank you for being a mind reader of a segment of the population that includes the above mentioned groups (blacks and Jews and every other identity the media has pushed upon us). How have you come to that conclusion? Experienced any of that personally? I'll bet that it's because of something the media has shown you. They aware the real enemy.

When I tried to transfer money just yesterday it came up with a page mentioning the change and saying that I needed to verify my social security number in order to complete the transaction. I had already verified a bank account and email address.

Awesome! Thank you. That's a huge help. The client is playing catch up right now actually. Didn't realize that's what it is doing. Pretty cool.

I had 40 or so bitcoins on a wallet from many years ago. Also forgot all about it and then took my laptop in to apple store one day for some fixing. They formatted the drive. Later in the year I hear bitcoins going crazy, may even hit $500! I remember my wallet but thought all hope was lost. Wish I had seen this. I've since sold the laptop.
