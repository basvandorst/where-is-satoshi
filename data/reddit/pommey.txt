No FUD here, just really in awe. It seems very unnatural to me to have this kind of influx of cash this quickly, with seemingly little effort on my part. Feels like I'm doing something illegal, ha.
One time at the bank I cashed my paycheck and due to a teller error they gave me about 10x what they were supposed to. I knew I hadn't done anything wrong, buy my first reaction was fear.
I ended up returning the money, I hadn't realized until a few hours later. The teller thanked my profusely and said she would have been fired.
Anyhow. This all just feels like some kind of error to me. I'm sure the party will eventually come to an end, but I just find myself, pretty much daily, being like, " :O "

I was more “wtf” on the $1500 gain in 24h :o

I'm scared.

I thought I was too late when I bought in at $300. You’ll find lots of people that regret times they’ve sold, but very few regret the times they bought.

If you bought $340 worth on September 14th of this year, you'd now have $1,000.
People recommend it because it's seeing very aggressive gains.
No one can really predict how/when/if it will crash. It's defied traditional investment behaviors because it's not a traditional investment.

Are you going to sell at 10k?
BTC is nearly at the $10,000 USD achievement. What are you planning when/if 10k hits?

There are several dozen retailers that accept bitcoin (Microsoft, Dell, Overstock, Newegg...)
It will probably need to become less volatile for it to be accepted as "normal currency"

I saw a little bit of Big Bang Theory on a plane once &amp; they had to restrain me because I was trying to pry open the emergency exit and die.

I always thought it seemed ridiculous when I read predictions about BTC getting to 10k. Yet here I am.

IT'S CRASHING UP!
