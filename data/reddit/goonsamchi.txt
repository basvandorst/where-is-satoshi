having isolated centralized failure points for off-chain transactions is not too bad. they are not 'centralized' in the sense that if one of them goes rogue or fails, it destroys the entire network. also, it's still a lot better than what we have today, where currency can be counterfeited and we won't even know about it.

I have a trick, but it's not too neat: when you send bitcoins to an address, if it's a Coinbase address, Coinbase will silently do an off-blockchain transaction. You can see this in the details of the payment, where it says bitcoins were sent to an external account, instead of a specific address.
By this method, you can determine whether a particular public address is associated with Coinbase or not.

Also, Bitcoin was extremely risky in the early days, so the early adopters deserve to be rewarded. Bitcoin is much, much less risky today (the software has come a *long* way since version 0.1), but it's still *very* early days and there remains huge potential for upside.
One last point: Bitcoin is an open source project and a technology (the protocol). It is not owned by anyone, much like Linux and SMTP (the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol that email is built on) are not owned by anyone. Who created Bitcoin? It really does not matter.

Looks like you've gotten some great advice, especially around being careful and not trusting anyone.
An additional idea, if you haven't thought of it already:
Look for how he may have transferred money in order to purchase bitcoins. For example, some people have ACH/wire transfers on their bank statements to companies like Coinbase, Bitstamp, or other exchanges. This "fiat link" may help to pinpoint how he bought his bitcoins (if any), so that you could check those account(s) to see if any remain there.

Agreed. Similarly, I think we shouldn't scare users for the load of running a USB ASIC. You will lose money, but you still help to make mining more decentralized.

I expect bitcoin's stability to eventually exceed that of gold, so today's "stability" is no surprise.
Happy to argue with the folks who think bitcoin's value will be volatile forever. Fundamentally, full reserves and easy verification (no counterfeiting) means that over time, it will become more stable than any other asset.
Even gold is unstable due to easy market manipulation, because it's not easy to take physical delivery of gold.
As a form of money, bitcoin is better than gold in every way that matters.

I agree with you; but OTOH, using large numbers like 500,000 of something is very normal in other currencies.
People have no problem with saying "$284k" when they mean 284,000 dollars; "$371M" is perfectly understandable to mean 371,000,000 dollars; "$843B" is very easy to understand as 843,000,000,000 dollars, and so on.
This is absolutely not the case going the reverse. It's really hard for normal people to see the difference between 0.00005 and 0.000005.

The US Dollar is the world's reserve currency today, hence the "???": we don't know how many years this will last.

Yep, I made the exact same initial mistake (initiated a transaction that was going to bounce), but my reaction was different: I contacted my bank instead, and quickly deposited the necessary amount.
In my case, nothing actually bounced, but I am under the impression (based on my discussion with my bank) that IF the transaction had bounced, I would not have been charged any fee; it would merely have canceled the transaction. Does this policy vary from bank to bank?
I think my account is technically a Savings account, though.

Whoa, Visa-only. That is interesting. Merchants that take Visa usually take MasterCard as well. Something weird is going on here

1. Why doesn't Baidu use a different bitcoin address for each transaction?
2. Are they using BitPay? If it's their own implementation, how does it work?

Hmm.. he founded BitInstant.. Why is it still down? It has been a loong time.

70% of people worldwide?
I think credit card penetration in the U.S. is a lot higher than 30%.

Adding bitcoin is yet another option on top of the pile  :)

Wait, I don't understand why Bitstamp allows you to sell at a price $20 below market. Shouldn't it sell at the highest "ASK" price that is equal to or greater than the price you want, not whatever you put in? What if you put in a sell order at $100 below market?

I love reading stories like these. It's really fascinating to see how popular sentiment is shifting. I recently talked with a very smart person who made the "tulips" objection, and I think I do a pretty good job making the case for why bitcoin is fundamentally different from the tulip frenzy.
When I meet people who seem open to bitcoin but don't have any yet, I always give them a little bit of bitcoin. It's important to me that mainstream people get a small slice of the pie. We can't let bitcoin be dominated by the SecondMarket Trust and ETF - the great potential of bitcoin is that it gives individuals control over their own money.

I'm in a group of China-based bitcoiners. The bitcoin community is very small and nascent. As of today, commercial adoption is not prevalent. It's minimal, with the most visible vendors just being a couple of bars. Most interest in bitcoin is for speculation, or as a store of value.
That said, I believe this will all change in the future.

Which wallet(s) did they use? I'm not happy with any of the wallet apps I've seen so far.

What, exactly, is the definition of "cusp"? Honest question from a non-math geek

Yes! Do this on every trip. In every airport. See how attitudes shift over time.

You should put a real address there. There's no reason not to. Addresses always start wiht a "1" and the satisfy a checksum that helps to ensure they're valid.

Wow, you should've taken a screenshot of that; I've never heard of such a notice.
