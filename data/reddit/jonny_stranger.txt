That's some aggressive salesmanship. Why would you say then that Charlie Lee predicts a multi-year bear market for LTC w/prices as low as $20usd per LTC?

You have to /s on this sub, I assume bot with that churlish attitude. You should still probably share info vs disinfo tho friend.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:38:05
Huh. The weird thing is I've gone down that list a few times already &amp; felt certain.
Well I'm no Gemini shill, Segwit should be standardized at 5 months. I haven't used Bitstamp or Kraken so can't opine on them.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:45:08
And the main trading pair in the crypto ecosystem with an immuted ledger stretching to the Genesis of this technology with name recognition and true decentralization you mean?
These things matter. Why are you in love with your alt?
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:52:53
&lt;3 your videos yo.

I think he makes a reasonable point honestly, and the FUD from the altcoin community and bank/governmental sectors + whale price manipulation can cause enormous waves in the pool.
Doesn't mean Bitcoin's true market value in 18 has been actualized yet.
Edit: If we truly believe conservative estimates are $30k by end of year then that's amazing news, because shit's AMAZINGLY cheap by that basis.

TBH those who bought in on the love train in early Dec at $16.7k or above have not made money in 2017 assuming HODL. 2017 a record-breaking year for BTC by any metric still clearly. :')
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:13:58
Yeah that guest list is hot fire. I suppose the subject matter will be more BTC past and future than current events since the interviews have clearly been recorded already and release is mid-2018. Good to have content to point to when explaining BTC to friends/relatives tho.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:17:28
As others have said, it is absolutely a feature. So many would happily stick a knife in Bitcoin's heart, but it's unkillable up until now, protected by thick primodial musculature and lizard brain. Slow and steady.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:54:26
They are a segwit active exchange plus owners (Winkelvoss twins) have largest stake in BTC outside of Satoshi, so at least you know owners are long on BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:45:03
Baseless and untrue FUD, the article on front page states that Microsoft still accepts bitcoin as payment.
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:40:22
Good info to have, not op but thx!
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:20:48
Your $$ on exchanged usually held in hot wallet so yu can easily transfer to another exchange's wallet ya.
In general it's considered risky to keep on exhange wallet however since you do not have true ctrl of your crypto, i.e. Mt Gox issues in past.
Good luck man!
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:48:41
USD much harder to transfer so I would imagine no.

talk be cheap
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:00:56
I also recommend Gemini, they have segwit implementation as well which means you have cheaper BTC fees. Coinbase/GDAX largely considered by Bitcoin community to be engaged in active BTC subterfuge/attacks on BTC system.
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:39:26
From learning and investing in btc in the last month or so (rip me) I started @ Gemini xch before the huddled masses apparently swamped the app process and when I decided to move my (limited) btc funds I moved to a Samourai hot wallet which is Segwit enabled.
Aside from that I haven't improved the network, still on 1st gear.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:39:36
Truth, although bots gonna bot. Goal for them is to derail, not debate.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:39:49
Andreas on the most recent Let's Talk Bitcoin pod even said there will be a likely increase in block size eventually. Segwit implementation across exchanges/wallets itself is enough to clear the mempool, and increasing block size simply switches the 'debt' of segwit implementation to those running a node (additional overhead) instead of wallet/exchange devs.
As I understand it. Am still learning.

You already said bye dude, you're losing your dignified exit :/
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:24
Samourai (spelling intentional) is a prereleased segwit-activated btc wallet. I like the security features touted although admittedly I can't independently verify them.
@_date: 2019-07-28 11:52:46
Lmao Q anon ppl don't have dignity so it's funny when they fake it.

Ya it just tells me that the speaker either doesn't understand Bitcoin or is on a misinformation campaign. BTC is open source, please point to where on the doll people can create more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:27:47
You are going to get general FUD feedback posting in r/bitcoin, there are many hoping for bitcoin to fail, and they're not just sitting around waiting for it to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:45:38
Gemini + Samourai is my current setup. I'm not looking for attaboys, I want BTC to do well in the markets.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:26:41
Good on Gemini, my exchange.

Bitcoin is not purely speculative, it has immense practical value, as Venezuelan's and many others who have used the currency to survive can attest. If the high tx fees are a result of the current mania x scalability issues as many have said than as soon as our current 'bubble' bursts it's practical applications return.
Also has best branding in crypto, is immuted after 8 yrs, etc.

And the housing market is dead now? Don't be dense. Bitcoin is unkillable in that the Bitcoin distributed ledger will be around until far past when us and our kiddos are kicking around.
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:38:12
How to say nothing in way too many words.
Edit: Bitcoin is pretty much unkillable. How much it will be worth compared to current market price is the question.
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:46:37
Rocks are far more killable than Bitcoin and their use cases are much more limited if that helps.

And Bitcoin can be exchanged for every ingredient in our roads, buildings, and animal buildings with a liquidity that your rock or pile of rocks would shake your fist at. Andreas has lived off his BTC for 3-4 years if you believe him. Try that with your rocks.
He can now build many roads with his Bitcoin. You still need a currency to build yours.

Useful? It has no use case that other's don't, and has little name recognition. That's why it's trying to crib Bitcoin's name.
