The U.S government sold about 30,000 BTC they confiscated from Silk Road. Might be hard to make an argument on legality at this point.

You were just advised that it is *retesting* lower very soon.

No, he did not say he spends $10k per week. He said he recently hit the weekly $10k max, suggesting he did it once.

M is the Roman Numeral for 1000.
MM is sometimes used as meaning M×M, or 1000×1000 (a million) — but technically in Roman Numerals MM is M+M (2000).

This applies to a variety of topics, not just bitcoin, but I don’t put any energy into discussing/defending something that the other person refuses to devote some energy to understanding first.
Especially when they think they understand enough about it and clearly do not.

PayPal can (and sometimes does) freeze your account for any reason and there is very little you can do about it.
There are other reasons, but if you were truly interested in why bitcoin is superior you would have done some homework and known this already.

Thanks for posting this. I have had my full node running for a few months now, and recently added a Lightning Network channel. It’s fun to tinker with this stuff and learn about it.
What are you using to get the stats and graphs you posted?

If you have a spare computer and a little technical experience you can do it pretty easily.
I took a 2011 Mac mini and used Pierre Rochard’s [Node Launcher]( to set up BTC/LN nodes — it runs great. Took a few days to download the blockchain.

Fascinating. They did a small deal (value-wise) which seems kind of like a big deal (big picture-wise).

Good on your dad—and you!
It seems to me that many older people don’t want to think for themselves any more, so they settle into their  old habits and traditions, not knowing they are missing out on so much in life that is interesting and fulfilling.

Right, and maybe not wise for McCormack to pick a legal battle that may just be a big distraction and could cost some money before it’s all done.
If someone appears to be a fraud, then let them be a fraud or prove otherwise. Ignore them and devote your time and energy to what matters.

Same. I’ll never understand how people can just scam and bullshit others to enrich themselves. I could not live that way if I tried.

I should have added: I intend to hold the keys, no custodial solution for me.
I don’t know if that leaves an option but maybe the self-directed IRA will allow for that. 
 As Andreas says: not your keys, not your coins.

I think the broader point is accurate. Older people, in general, tend to be less receptive to change. Especially major changes like redefining a monetary system that they have known and used their entire life. 
I’m 56 and big on BTC but very few of my peers know anything about it. Or dismiss it entirely because they have not bothered to study it.
