Hello r/Bitcoin! Some of you may remember that three months ago I made a survey looking at the demographics and opinions of crypto redditors and comparing the results across different subreddits. Now, three months later r/Bitcoin has over 350,000 new members and the cryptocurrency market cap is triple what it was when I made the survey! I have decided that I will make a new survey with many of the same questions to see how the community has changed! (Obviously I have had to remove the "do you think bitconnect is a ponzi scheme?" question) 
**If you would like to fill in the survey, you can do that [here.](
Unfortunately I was unable to post the results post for the original survey here because the post was continually getting removed automatically and I decided to leave it since I felt like I had shared it on enough of the other subreddits for most people to see it. For those of you who haven't seen the results to my previous survey, you can see that [here.] (
Thanks for your time!
**Edit:** Live results of the new survey here:

Hey r/Bitcoin! Your sub is currently underrepresented in the second reddit cryptocurrency survey. I need some more of you to fill in the survey so I can see how the community has changed over the last 3 months. **Do you think that the community is more memes now? Or are there more weak hands?** Then please share your thoughts and fill in the survey so we can find out how the community has changed!

Not really. Vitalik owns about 300,000-400,000 ETH out of the total ~100,000,000 ETH. As for others, just take a look at the largest wallets here on EtherScan:

I made a survey 3 months ago so I could compare the differences between different crypto subreddits. Now, 3 months on I see a large portion of the community complaining about all of the noobs, shills etc who have come from the recent bull run. So I thought I would do the survey again and this time, I can compare how the community has changed and see if people's complaints are justified.

That's harsh. Fiat daily gave me 4/5.
In all seriousness though, I knew that this wasn't top quality content but it's just so hard to come up with good memes when the price is going sideways.

Have you ever looked at the top three posts of all time in this sub? Plus I don't even mention price once in this GIF. Based on the content in this sub, that rule is more referring to talk of trading and price action.

Hi again, r/Bitcoin! This is the last chance to fill in the quarterly reddit cryptocurrency survey. (yes that means no more seeing this post in the daily every couple of days!) The survey where every 3 months I collect responses from the reddit crypto community to see how the community has changed since the last few surveys.

Hey again r/Bitcoin!
I'm still in need of some more participants for the Reddit Cryptocurrency Survey since the data set is still a little bit too small to use right now. So if you haven't yet, do your part for the crypto community and please fill out the survey.
**If you wish to participate, you can do so here:** 
If you'd like to see the results of my previous survey, you can find them here: 
Thank you very much to everyone who participates. I'll be back here to share the results with you in a few weeks. I'm looking forward to sharing the results with you all!
@_date: 2019-03-01 20:43:32
Yeah, I realise this, but one person could also make multiple fake responses much easier if I were to change that setting. I'd rather have less responses which I know are all over the risk of fake data.

Hello r/Bitcoin! I'm back to do another Reddit Cryptocurrency Survey. My last one was back in January of 2018 so it will be interesting to see how the community has changed throughout this bear market. I imagine it will be quite a lot!

Unfortunately not. Unless you know of a privacy friendly and convenient alternative I could use next time.

Well actually, I bought at 2k, so no. Only an idiot buys at ATH.
@_date: 2018-03-21 09:40:59
Yeah, I considered that, but I decided not to because the words already there add to the comedic effect as well as showing how hard this pullback has been - especially for many alt-coins.
@_date: 2018-11-30 07:16:07
I don't recall putting a timescale on when it will rebound. Bear markets are often prolonged. If BTC drops below $1000 and stays there for a year then I'll concede that Bitcoin is a failed project. But for the moment, I am still quite comfortable with where it is at and I am personally not at a loss.
So come back in 2-3 years then I will re-assess the situation. If I am wrong I will happily admit to being wrong.

That's because they are new, inexperienced "investors" who probably couldn't even tell you what blockchain is. Hence, "idiots" as far as cryptocurrencies and investing goes.

I just used Final Cut Pro X, but any video editing software which isn't too basic should be able to do it. Sony Vegas and the Adobe suite of software can definitely make videos like this.

Sure, but all three of those have issues. Gfycat/Imgur don't have sound, and unless it's r/videos, YouTube videos do poorly because many people can't watch it due to YouTube being a blocked website on the public/work wifi network they are using.

Why would you expect it to be at 30k now? You'd be an idiot. That's unsustainable growth. Come back in two years and tell me this. Please. The moment the growth went parabolic rising above 7k, I knew there would be a big pullback. This is normal. I have still made a profit and I am still as bullish long term as I was 6 months ago.

I don't know the ones you're talking about, but [I made one a week or two ago] ( about not sharing private keys and I intend on making more. I have some scenes in mind which would make appropriate GIFs.

Sure. That's why most of my holdings are in Ethereum or ERC20 tokens on the ethereum network because smart contracts and DApps have a place in the future while Bitcoin might not.
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:27:51
Unfortunately not. However I'm sure that there will be a free alternative which can do the same thing. Or you could... you know... download it from a Totally Legitimate And Definitely Not A Piracy Website™.

It's actually pretty basic, it just takes a few hours to go through everything frame by frame. You can learn how to do it quite quickly using Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere/After Effects or the one I use, Final Cut Pro.

I was unsure whether to make the second one altcoins to note the fact that they have crashed too, but they didn't cause BTC to fall, so I felt like all the fake Korea and India government FUD would be more appropriate.

The current price is 11k. I made it 30k in the GIF just to prove a point about what Bitcoin has done historically and applied it to the current price movements. It is by no means guaranteed to hit 30k.
Also, you're talking about buying the dips. That's what the people who truly believe in the underlying technology do while the new investors are the ones who tend to panic sell at 6k after they bought in at 20k.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:20:00

Well, for the second crash, yes. But the first crash down to 12k was in December, before most of the altcoins had their bull runs.

I bought Ethereum at it's peak in June when it was $300-400. It dropped to $150 but I kept on holding. After it's recent bull run I'm up 300%. This is how crypto markets work. There is a crazy bull run which goes hyperbolic before pulling back. In theory it will continue this pattern if they become mainstream and are used everyday. Just be patient. It isn't easy, but if you invest in a cryptocurrency which will be widely used 10 years from now then you will be very well off.

Thanks! I've seen some surveys similar to this before, but they didn't cover people opinions and portfolios so I wanted to cover them. Also, other previous surveys weren't really shared on many different subs and they didn't collect which subs people came from and I think it'll be really interesting to see the difference in portfolios between trading and non-trading subs as well as seeing how opinions vary between r/Bitcoin and r/BTC.

Well, the first fall in the GIF was the first part of the bitcoin pullback (December 2017) and the altcoins didn't start to fall until mid-late January. Unfortunately I couldn't portray this in the GIF.

@_date: 2018-07-17 17:46:03
I think you're absolutely right. Fundamentals are great right now. There has been plenty of good news with little to no response from the price. As for the technicals, r/BitcoinMarkets is still a bit split in the short to mid term, but it is unlikely that we'll drop any more than another 30% from here, and that's being cautious.

That's a valid point. I guess I assumed that for the few people who have sold, (leaving them less than when they started) would have interpreted it as meaning would the original amount they had bought be worth more than you paid for it.
