Yes, it's limited to approximately 7 transactions a second on average.  If bitcoin sees mainstream adoption this limit will have to go up.  There are several ways this could happen, all with big problems:
* just increase the limit.  Problem:  only the wealthy can afford to host the blockchain, as the needed bandwidth and disk space would be large.  Individuals would have to resort to third party intermediaries.
* offchain transactions.  Problem: individuals would have to resort to third party intermediaries.
* balkanization of the blockchain, I.e. only storing a portion of the blockchain on each node and adding some sort of routing.  Problem:  this is an order of magnitude more complex than the current system and the issues that would need to be solved are numerous.
* what else?
The first two just bring us back to the old system of trusting big centralized regulated  entities, so we are no better off than before.
The latter requires yet unknown technology: in other words, the current blockchain algorithm is broken.

The blockchain isn't about a free market though.  It's about provable trust and security.  Not everyone believes that laissez-faire works perfectly and in the best interest of the individual.  The blockchain isn't "buyer beware".

Off-blockchain transactions can handle this.  Bitcoin is just the backbone, not the whole thing.

Can't wait for bitcoin to stand on its own without needing comparison to fiat as it's main demonstration of worth.

What if you don't sell the mined bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:17:32
What are the options though?   That's what I'm asking.
@_date: 2014-06-24 00:04:20
You didn't address bandwidth and machine requirements, which are much more expensive.

With gridcoin, If mining with a BOINC algorithm, how is work proven?  It seems that a bullshit BOINC project could be made to game the system.  Whoever controls the registry of BOINC projects controls gridcoin.

doesn't that defeat the purpose of bitcoin?

But if you can't directly interact with the blockchain then you are beholden to regulators and collusion once again.  You lose most of the benefits of the blockchain - semi-anonimity, no chargebacks, payment freedom to send coins to anyone anywhere on earth nearly instantaneously, etc.

additional clarification: the two transactions are for different bitcoin.  You aren't transferring the same coins twice.  You are tricking someone (in this case gox) to pay you twice.

Its so easy to say there's no need for a blockchain reflexively without thinking it out.  Yes there is need for a blockchain.  Otherwise the identity registry is in control of an individual or small group, and access to it can be controlled, and the contents of it can be changed or deleted.  The difference is obvious.
@_date: 2015-05-28 17:11:05
And also you may have to pay money to use it at all.  And also this company can track identity lookups

The scalability problem seems huge to me.  Does anyone have a proposal on how to address it?

You are making two potentially false assumptions:
1. A history of deep understanding in economics and currencies is all you need to predict the future of bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a lot more than an economic instrument, and it's also extremely different from other economic instruments.
2.  Warren Buffet has no alterior motives with his statement.

If you don't buy directly instead of on an exchange it doesn't move the market cap.

Most people here have a severely biased opinion because they are emotionally invested in the price.  They've all got bitcoin holdings and so the price drop is viscerally painful for them.  Take that out of the equation and it's not so bad.  The price has been a lot more stable than before, though definitely needs to be more stable to act as a first class holder of value.

BTC is nothing but a protocol.  Anything beyond that is your own personal philosophy.

Yeah the internets get confusing sometimes without the body language to help us interpret the meaning of others.

I kinda like "millies" and "mikes" for mBTC and uBTC.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:34:30
Yeah, just a few months ago I had found out that the mining software I installed was running in stealth mode on my computer for a couple years, which explained why it was always overheating.

I remember really hard trying to get a mining rig set up over two years ago and giving up because it was awkward and malware-y.   FUUUUUUUCK.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:45:31
I think it was a bit more malicious than that.  I never configured a delivery address, and also had already "uninstalled" it.  I only discovered it after the malware bytes scanner found it.

Perhaps people might think that apples totalitarian policies are fucked up and yet not be circlejerking.

I was just saying what I said 10 minutes ago.
