My goal is somewhere in the middle. I want to be rich by 35 lol... but then I do work full time and run a business - so stress may kill me before then ��

Ahh fair point and well put! I can certainly see where you are coming from. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 10:26:14
The code has zero value.
Did you know most altcoins are literally a copy and paste job of bitcoin? 
The system provides value - the code is part of the system.
Again - I will point to bitcoin cash - perfect example - their code has very little derived value mostly from being a snapshot/airdrop accepted by many exchanges providing liquidity for traders and being propped up by Jihan himself with Bitmains earnings.
Take the opposite side of the spectrum - if I start a bitcoin clone - does that immediately give it value? Maybe to me - maybe not to you.
Code by itself is just code.
A community of people that agree on that code and strive to make it better for the people using that code combined with people that see long term vision for that code and invest in infrastructure for said code to run on is part of what gives bitcoin value, at least from my perspective.

I agree 100% with your description. 
Individuals are replaceable by design. 
I guess where I’m coming from is I’m seeing a lot of negative sentiment around PoW in the space lately. A few bad actors doesn’t make the system bad. 
If anything, I am a PoW maximalist.

I’ll pass. I’ll get whatever is the best in Dec / Jan from Inno or GMO.
Been burned too many times by Bitmain. Even if it’s the best - I don’t want it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:31:31
Checked it out, cool community! 
@_date: 2018-09-16 09:44:41
This is just wrong. 
It’s a system. You break one piece - the system fails.
You can’t have a chain with devs and miners but no users - Bcash
You can’t have a chain with devs and users but no miners - any PoS or DpoS ponzi
You can’t have a chain with no devs but users and miners - any shit grade mineable alt coin.
I just don’t get it. I’m a user and a miner but I don’t dev - why am I disposable? Without value it’s just code.

Who told me? 
I’m a midsize gpu miner (80 gpu) that talks to much larger miners. (2500+ gpu)
I talk to people that maintain large farms for other people. 
I talk to the pill devs on a regular basis. (Also the main dev is a chick, and an absolutely amazing human being by the way! Much love for the girl. )
I talk to the devs and community members going through the transition period of GPU to asic. 
How many satoshi per day are you making on NiceHash? How many 6 months ago. 
What algorithm do you mostly run with NiceHash? I’m guessing lyra2v2 and ETHASH? 
Do you have even the SLIGHTEST clue on how the landscape has changed recently? 
And no, NiceHash is nothing compared to the farms out there.  It’s typically less than 10% representation of total hashrate of GPU. 
Edit: if I wasn’t clear - Nvidia doesn’t care about mining or bitcoin. If they did, they could have spent money to support the gpu mining community. They did not. If you are investing in mining moving forward, be careful investing in additional GPU.
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:26:48
Yeah it’s down for me as well.
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:42:30
I have 6 VEGA 56
39? 1080 TI
28 1070 TI
6? 1080 vanilla 
Honestly lost count - might be closer to 75 Gpu at this point. 
Yes, I am angry - it’s hard to debate with someone who is assertive but uses no data to back it up- in other words, a moron. 
I have 3 D9 from Inno with 2 z9 minis on the way. I’m hoping to pick up 2-3 A9 next month. 
Gpu mining is dead. Just because they are still turned on doesn’t mean it isn’t dead. 
Check my post history. I’ve been selling my GPU in hardware swap. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:34:19
You are stretching now. 
That’s fine. One of the quotes was on simulation theory - a very complex philosophical issue. I was making light of the situation. 
You didn’t link the part where I said it was speculative science at best and not to take it too seriously. That’s ok. 
You’ve gone so far off topic that this will be my final response to you. It’s just some weird pissing match you seem to want to continue.

Looks like OP purchased himself an old account and is looking to setup a social engineering scam.
Were they all out of 7 year+ accounts or are those just too spendy?
Reported.

100% of large farms are operated remotely with 1-2 people replacing equipment if it fails. 
If this brings more than 2 jobs paying minimum wage, I’ll be shocked.
Source: talked to multiple people that run large farms and people that work in large farms. The bigger the farm, the more automation.  
@_date: 2018-08-21 10:18:32
Damn. 
They. Have. Nothing. 
I heard their last two chip attempts failed but if this doesn’t confirm it, I don’t know what will.

Mining isn’t done on GPU anymore.
Nvidia and AMD had the opportunity to step in and help with software but they failed too. 
All major algorithms were ASICd in the last 6 months. 
Considering the memory bandwidth estimates on Turing - ETH / ETC mining will go ASIC by November.
GPU (general compute hardware) was supposed to be a tool to help with mining decentralization. 
We failed. 
Maybe we can use analytics from the Monero v7 fork as a guide with how to proceed in the future. 
A few months after forking the chains Bitmain made died and were delisted. 
Monero experienced an 80% drop in hashrate directly after fork and before profit rebalancing. 
If Nvidia wanted to make a market around crypto mining they could, simply with better tools. 
As a for instance: a stock 1080 TI does 36mh - a community team produced software to change timings of the GDDR5X and they can do 57+ on newer cards. 
Same with AMD blockchain driver - half ass attempt with zero updates and a buggy implementation. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:15:14
Yup. You got it all figured out.
I guess Nvidia is trolling their investors also?
@_date: 2019-11-16 03:23:53
As a miner I’m required to keep track of when I receive my block rewards and pay income taxes on that. If I hold I pay capital gains tax on the difference of what it was mined for vs what it sold for. 
Terrible for accounting.

HODL! Loaf run imminent

Likely an asset tied to an asset chain (Ravencoin for instance) will switch ownership if you default.
Still a lien on property just in the blockchain

One question to the manufactures- as I seen this product and initially wrote it off as a scam.
All I want to know is who is fabbing 8nm for you? Because this node isn’t on Samsung, GF or TSMC roadmap. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:04:41
We need warranties to get better then. 
Manufactures can’t have it both ways. 
1 year seems pretty standard on most things.

Well currently Bitcoin is bear but I do think Bitcoin will be bull sometime soon. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:25:40
Holy shit you might actually be right.
I usually write these posts off but hot damn! I think it’s time. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 13:32:55
Yeah. Seems pretty obvious to me. It’s just hard to prove so I just hope it goes away. ����
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:43:38

They peg it to a dollar. So supposedly there’s a dollar deposited for every token that’s issued.
@_date: 2019-12-24 22:50:27
Interesting. I was unaware. Yeah no idea on those!

Depending on your location possibly a bitcoin ATM. 
I heard they charge a premium though - think it was like 10%?

Yes!!!!!! Just like he claimed FTL propagation of blocks. Can’t find that anymore... wonder why.
I called him out in a heartbeat on that one. Jeez. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:38:43
I did it. 
Not sure if it will make a difference but it only takes a few minutes.

New Steven seagal movie - he’s really let himself go lately. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:26:33
Lol the hashrate on the original chain never changed much after the fork.
It was absolutely ASICS.
