If someones lures to do something and robs you I guess you're imbecile as well.
Imbecile or not it does not take fact away that someone attacks at you.

Silver has been used as a money for 4k years. Why people are so dumb at the moment that they accept such devaluation of money that humans have used forever? How this connects with Bitcoin? I mean... If Bitcoin is cheap and silver is cheap, but bitcoin has higher valuation than silver something does not calculate. I know that Bitcoin is much more than money for modern society and money has much more properties today than silver can offer, but still... something needs to click.

No. It's attack; if someone lures you to dark corner and violently robs you it's attack.

Right, like shooting with a gun is not attack, speaking is not attack, throwing a rock is not attack... All depends on context. What you intend to do with your actions could be attack.
What attachment of that email did was an attack. Email was just medium used to launch that attack.

Sending snail mail is not attack either. So... someone could send mail bomb to you and when you open it and blow yourself and your house to thousand pieces you're kind of attacking on yourself?
