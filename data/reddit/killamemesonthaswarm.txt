Honest question, how do you suppose people handle their paychecks? Its idealistic that businesses will either pay in straight cash or crypto. Checks also break down your deductions and can be directly deposited as well. Credit unions are a better alternative to banks (tend to be less predatory, non profit) but still in the same industry.

One thing Im noticing on cash app is the only authentication is either phone or email.... so even if I signed out and someone else had my phone they could theoretically still log in. Seems to me the transfer PIN is the only line of defense in this scenario.

Hey guys, these are all probably dumb questions, but im not sure who else to ask. The beginner btc sub is pretty inactive for the most part.
After all this time, I finally have invested in btc. Its not much, but I can afford to lose it if everything went to hell. I am aware that its a longterm imvestment especilly with current prices. I used cash app to buy it. My questions are:
Am I wasting my time with cash app? From what I saw it is pretty seamless, user friendly, and receives positive reception.
Do I need to get a hard wallet to make my effort worth it? Is it possible to simply use my phone primarily?
Cash app not only charges services fees, they also will send you a tax form to claim gains yoi have made. This seems a bit odd to me; do other services have you claim gains like that?
Theres a user here who Ive seen sharing a website for free mBTC for doing menial tasks like helping asvertisers or doing surveys or things like that. How trustworthy are services like that?

Credit unions are a better alternative IMO. Although they are often less convenient and lack the innovative resources to improve customer utilities, they often treat customers better with rates and less penalties/restrictions.
