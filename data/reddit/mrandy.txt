Regardless of how their business operates internally (and lets admit that we're all just guessing about that), OP has a reasonable expectation that MtGox provide a service as advertised.  Every business has risk; it's not the customer's job to pay for it except when explicitly stated.

I like the way you think!  I think you might have an issue with real trades attacking your prices, but I have faith that you can figure it out.
@_date: 2012-12-08 19:06:51
Thanks, I'll do that.
@_date: 2012-11-30 17:57:23
Um, thanks for downvoting?  I know it's not as cool as bashing MtGox, but I think the community could still use this information.
@_date: 2012-11-26 12:37:29
"The end result ? Well… certainly not more nigger homeowners" WTF?
@_date: 2012-12-07 18:45:05
Could you post a screen shot?  I'd like to see this, but my PC is confused with this .numbers file.

Thanks for the response.  Unfortunately I tried several times to withdraw 0.50 BTC, rather than 0.52, thinking that this might be the case, without success.  After reading your message right now I tried again, unsuccessfully.
Also, not to nitpick, but if your system is designed such that no one can withdraw their entire account balance, isn't that a major PITA for you in terms of support?

I'm referring to the part that says "Last price:" at the top-left of the page.  I'm not looking at the High and Low at all.  The other two numbers are the "Lowest Ask Price" and "Highest Bid Price" that appear in the Buy/Sell interface, not the ticker bar.
@_date: 2012-09-06 17:23:34
That makes perfect sense and does explain how the situation could occur.
I'm suprised that that's possible in a large market though.  In your example you stated "No other orders exist", but with MtGoxLive we can see that there are buy and sell orders for at least hundreds of dollars within a penny or two of the midpoint.  
It seems like for this situation to come up someone has to buy or sell literally ALL of the availability on the market in one direction more quickly that new orders can be put online (which is what happened in your example when D bought all of the asset available at $10).  Does this happen?

So the way bitcoin works there's no difference in purchasing for offline storage vs. online storage.  When you purchase bitcoins they go to an address that you specify, and the seller doesn't know or care if that address is live, cold-storage, or even non-existent.  So the question you're asking is really just, "how do I purchase bitcoins?"  
This works because bitcoins are never really "delivered", but rather a global announcement is made that they've been sold to such-and-such an address.  If it turns out that you control that address, either at the time, or years later, you can spend the bitcoins at that address.

I noticed this interesting buying pattern while watching the MtGox monitoring on ClarkMoody.com.  Someone placed dozens of individual Sell orders for 0.01 BTC matching the current market price in rapid succession.  You can see on the Time &amp; Sales column all of these identical, tiny orders being filled in rapid succession.
I assume this is some sort of robo trading, I'm just curious what the purpose of it is.  Do trades gain some advantage if they can manage to lag Mt. Gox?  Does the quantity of sell orders trigger some automatic reponse in other bots (doesn't look like it, judging from the lack of activity after this barrage completed).  Any ideas?

If the core developers honestly believe that, they are so inside the bubble of development that they can't be objective about the bitcoin economy.
The network is going to have growing pains, and those are going to fall mostly on the shoulders of the devs.  That's a lot of pressure, but it's also a natural part of the process.  To call a legitimate business a virtual criminal is immature and short-sighted.
@_date: 2012-11-27 21:18:53
You're right, I stand corrected.
@_date: 2012-11-24 22:37:01
Well superficially, but that doesn't explain why someone would go through the effort to do this.
@_date: 2012-12-09 21:39:26
I don't think that's what "side effect" means.
@_date: 2012-11-24 22:16:55
Edit.  **Just noticed your referral code in your link.  Asshole.**
Edit   I guess marking it as a referral makes that ok.  Given your post history, I'm pretty sure you knew the answer before you posted this question, and are just using it as an excuse to make money.
With that setting, there's one open square out of 25, so your chances of winning a round are 1/25, or 4%.
A win multiplier of 22.5 is impressive, but you have to multiply that by how often you are likely to win.  So 22.5 times 4% = 22.5 * 0.04 = 0.90, or 90%.
If you play often enough, you'll see an average return on investment of 90%, so the house has a 10% edge, making it quite profitable.
This is a sort of psychological trick.  It seems like you'll usually get the right square in less than 20 tries, but that's not really going to be the case.  Occasionally you'll have long runs of bad luck that more than compensate for your good luck.

Oh.  Still cool, but the terms of the coupon are really "Save $5 on a $200 order", no?
@_date: 2012-12-17 18:43:45
I'm interested... Where do I find this $10 for 5 coupon?

You say "the primary effect of SatoshiDice is to harm the network" as if all of the gambling that happens there is just a side effect.  That's like saying the primary effect of a police department is killing police officers, or the primary effect of eating is obesity.  Both of those consequences do happen, but they're not the main one.
@_date: 2012-12-05 17:27:34
Exactly right.  Dunno why this is being downvoted, it's a serious concern and reasonably articulated.
@_date: 2012-09-06 18:07:33
Cool, thanks
@_date: 2012-12-09 00:18:19
So my notepad math says that given their just over 2 million bets, they have paid about 1000 BTC in transaction fees, but their users have probably paid closer to 10000 BTC, using a rate of 0.005.  That means that Dice has generated about $147,000 in transaction fees for miners.  Does that sound right?
@_date: 2012-11-24 22:01:45
So what's happening is this:
A bot (or very dedicated human!) is executing tiny sell orders right after any buy order.  This causes the Last price on the ticker to always be the Bid, or lower of the two current prices.  It also causes the most recent market direction to always be "down", for systems that display that based on the last transaction.
I wonder what the intention of this bot is.  Does anyone with more experience in markets recognize this behavior?  
Since the system only works as long as no one in the entire marketplace is doing the opposite behavior, I wonder what happens if I make a bot that does the same thing, in the opposite direction.
@_date: 2012-12-01 13:32:21
Thanks!  Seems to have worked.
@_date: 2012-12-10 19:26:17
That was my thought too, along with wondering what "MtGox-dependent" had to do with anything.
@_date: 2012-11-30 19:47:10
Is there something happening tomorrow that I missed?  Otherwise I think the price will continue it's slow climb and stay in the 12.5 - 12.6 range.

I wonder why BitFinex isn't on the list.  It's volume would make it about the fifth-biggest exchange.

I know this is only generally related to bitcoin, but I'm excited to be launching a product and processing bitcoins from day one.  If the mods want me to move this elsewhere, just let me know.

I've been an occasional commentor on r/bitcoin for a while now, and I've owned and mined bitcoins since 2011, but this is the first chance I've had to support bitcoin in a professional role.  Some much more talented friends and I have put this system together, and it really works.  I'm happy to be accepting bitcoin payments, and I'm offering 10% - 25% off to redditors, using the coupon code RBITCOIN.
If anyone wants to talk about how things work, or has suggestions, let's hear 'em!
tldr:  Good proxy software for online games.  Redditors 10-25% off.

I posted about the issue on bitcointalk, and Tulkas responded asking me to PM him details about my account.  I did so, and didn't hear from him again.  I followed up several days later and still didn't get a response.
I eventually figured out that it was an error in my settings, which I fixed and was able to withdraw the money on my own.  However despite the reddit posts, forum posts, private support emails, neither Tulkas or anyone at BTCJam made any effort to resolve this problem.

Best of luck getting this resolved.  Maybe try posting on the Scam Accusations board on bitcointalk.org?  I've used bitinstant before with good success, but never had to open a support ticket and experience that process.
