Apparently they were a source to buy and sell in 2015 they give some instructions I don’t fully understand and don’t want to make any stupid moves before I fully get it.  I just sent support an email about private key also. Thank you

where  can you buy Ripple in the US? I know many aren’t taking new customers or taking forever to verify.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:46:50
I sent them an email as well 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:21:02
Is that true? I haven’t read that but it’s pretty hard to sift what is real and what isn’t. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:03:13
Yes you do.

Here’s part 2 from them.  They just got out of it. Says coinbase is a partner -
Some information about Bitcoin for Circle customers who still hold it.
Note: We no longer offer the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin. Customers who hold Bitcoin can continue to receive and send Bitcoin, but once they convert their balance to another currency, they will not be able to convert it back to Bitcoin. For more information, check out our help article about the changes, found here.
Sending Money using the Bitcoin Network
Bitcoin customers can send money to anyone anywhere in the world no matter what Bitcoin wallet the recipient uses (other cryptocurrencies are not supported). As the message above mentions, only customers holding Bitcoin will be able to send money to a BTC address. All transactions are free, secure, and fast no matter where you are sending the funds.
Sign in to your account and navigate to the Send tab. There, you can enter in the amount you’d like to send.
You will have to enter the Bitcoin address to choose where to send your funds. Once the recipient sends you the address for their destination, we suggest copying and pasting the address into the send page to prevent any mistakes.
Alternatively, you can use the Circle Pay app to scan a QR code to send funds, and that will fill in the address information for you! (Other Bitcoin services and online merchants provide QR codes to complete payments.) To scan a QR code, select the QR Code option on the main Account tab, and just point your camera at the code.
How long do bitcoin transactions take to complete?
Bitcoin transactions can take anywhere between a few minutes to about 40 minutes.
That being said, the timeline depends on the network itself. Since the settlement of bitcoin transactions is governed by the speed of confirmations on the blockchain (the public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions), Circle has no way of canceling transactions or speeding them up.
A single confirmation on the blockchain happens within ten minutes. And since Circle requires four such confirmations before clearing a transaction and no longer considering it Pending, the average completion time for these transactions is about 40 minutes.
Note: If 40 minutes has passed, just keep checking back! It will eventually complete �� .
Where can you find your Bitcoin address?
As mentioned in the note at the top, only customers who hold Bitcoin will be able to generate an address. When someone who isn't on Circle wants to send you money, you need to generate a Bitcoin address for destination of payment (Circle customers can just send money to each other via email address). Circle makes it easy to create as many Bitcoin addresses as you would like.
Here's how to generate a BTC address for your Circle account:
On Circle.com
Click on your name in the top right corner of the screen
Click on Get Address in the dropdown menu
On iOS
Click on the Settings button, second from the right under your account balance on the main Messages tab
Choose My Address from the list
At the top of the screen, select My Address
On Android
Click on the QR Code button, after clicking on the 3 vertical dots in the top right corner of the main screen
At the top of the screen, select My Address
This will generate a new Bitcoin address every time that will stay connected to your Circle account.
You can send that QR code and Bitcoin address to anyone that you choose by copying the address (if you are using a browser) or by selecting the sharing option at the bottom of that page (if you are using a mobile phone).
Other cryptocurrencies
At the moment, Circle does not support any other cryptocurrencies.

I can't move it unless I cash it out. They still use bitcoin behind the scenes but they are not giving me a private key.  Sell in USD and move it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:25:45
Yep I'm at their mercy
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:56:59
Every single place I could buy it is so backed up with verification or not taking new customers.  Oh well 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:41:16
I’m curious because it sure seems slow enough to not have issues.

It’s Saturday of another holiday weekend the US is basically on vacation until Tuesday.  If your company doesn’t already give it to you people save their vacation time for this week.  Kids are all of school and Disneyworld and Disneyland are so packed they are at capacity.  Tuesday it’s back to reality. 
What does that mean to the crypto world? I honestly don’t know.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:05:29
I think my post agrees with this.  It’s right above or below you.   I agree that was a shitshow.  But it’s also the key to where you put your money in this crypto market if you want to. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:00:13
You are talking about over a certain dollar amount.  It sounds to me like it will work like PayPal- you do
Over a certain # of transactions a year and a certain $ amount is brought in they report it to the government and you get a 1099.   
Now if you want to write off losses, yes will need detailed records which you can also do in a google spreadsheet.  
It’s not that hard.  I assume fees would be costs that can be written off.   You can use a schedule c for taxes I think.  This is just what I think (my opinion, do your own research) double check with an accountant and I’m not one.  Start at the beginning unless you are talking millions then you’d better be talking to an accountant ASAP.

Thank you so much 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:07:23
yes this. I want to understand more about why it's holding it's value. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:24:41
FYI, the answer is NO. I can leave my Bitcoin there or sell it for USD and withdraw.  Other than that, I have no control over it.

Copied from Circle below 
New Ventures of Old Bitcoin
Since we started, our vision has been to make money work like the internet: instant, global, secure and free. Now we’re making payments more social than ever and diving headfirst into next-gen blockchain technology, rather than the buying and selling of bitcoin itself. What’s this mean for you? Lots of options.
1. Sell your bitcoin and cash out
To get your bitcoin out of Circle, just go to Settings&gt;Currency and convert your balance to dollars, pounds or euro (availability is based on where you live). You’ll then be able to cash out instantly.
Note: You must have a valid linked card or bank account to do this.
2. Send that bitcoin packing
Move your money to any bitcoin address — including any exchange or wallet of your choosing — anywhere in the world.
3. Buy and sell bitcoin with Coinbase
Use our preferred partner, Coinbase, to continue buying and selling bitcoin.
4. Store your bitcoin with us
You're welcome to hold bitcoin in your Circle account and it will be covered by our third party private insurance, like always. You can also receive bitcoin to any address associated with your account.
Note: You can no longer buy and sell bitcoin through us.
5. Convert to your local currency to pay friends and get paid
Go to Settings &gt; Currency and convert your bitcoin balance to dollars, pounds or euro (availability is based on where you live).
Note: Once you switch your currency, you can’t return to bitcoin and you can no longer send money to bitcoin addresses.
A few reasons this option is ��:
Send money just like a text or email (or better yet, receive it)
Travel between $, £ and €. Best rates. No fees. No, really.
Put your money where your text is in iMessage
�� , �� and raccoons with grocery cart GIFs, for starters

It’s not a joke I have read many rumors about them adding it and soon but consider it complete speculation.  If that did happen it would have the “coinbase effect” and probably make their system even worse.  It’s pretty quiet right now if I was going to work on my stuff it’d be now.  I believe if they added crapcoin to their platform for sale people would buy it without asking any questions.  What would you do if you were coinbase? I would add more currencies.

I’m new and only because I found .37 worth I bought in summer of 2015. I’ve started reading and learning since then which was at 10,500. These are a few thoughts after waking up to this a month ago or however long that was.
I’ve realized a lot of people are buying and they don’t know what they are  buying or buying into so I’m trying to figure it out for myself and have it make sense. 
What if Bitcoin and it’s lack of a central company running it and it sticking to exactly what you can count on (rules) without human manipulation become (maybe already is) what is most appealing about Bitcoin long term? It’s security and reputation.  Maybe it’s not. Love to read other thoughtful opinions. 
At this moment it can’t be spent on anything really so if you cash out there’s no hiding that from any taxman if you wanted to.  The only way this works is if you can eventually spend it or be able to somehow cash it out without reporting.  Is this a reason everyone is getting in? (Everyone meaning the little guy) There will never be rules and regulations beyond what was created in 2009.  
But someone has to cash you out.  I admit to being worried about coinbase.  Again I’m a newbie I could be wrong but it felt like what they did releasing bit cash had a lot to do with disrupting the market and what they’re releasing is a direct competitor.  How do you offer at $200 per coin or whatever it started at the other day and cash people out 3 days later at $3000 a coin? How does that work to NOT put you out of business.  Also huge BC price dips with people cashing out. Are “whales” using Coinbase? Someone me thinks not.  Love opinions. 
Then You’ve got Ripple and Ethereum to create and follow regulations probably sooner than later to satisfy their backers.  It appears they create functionality in the block chain world by creating apps giving access to companies to have their own block chain etc.  this personally makes a lot of sense and isn’t what Bitcoin is about or doing.  That’s not what it is built to do. So they are different.  
The human piece of these and their backers make it ripe for human manipulation especially in the lack of regulation phase of the whole thing .  I like that Ripple as a currency can stand alone without its company.  
I think being the main liaison for buying and selling in the US is Coinbase and then dropping your own currency on all of your new users you’ve built is fair game at the moment but really shitty.  Nothing to stop them and most wont realize this “top 5” crypto actually belongs to Coinbase.  
Average new crypto buyer had fun last week no fun this week and some are probably suicidal at the moment.  I couldn’t do anything with mine until I understood more and since then it’s gone crazy. 
I’m looking long term. Who survives in the crypto world?

Do you think they are working on strengthening so they can put up Xrp?
