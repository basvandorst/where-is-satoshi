Then lambos.

that was definitely pre-btc.  but if it was bitcoin back then I would have payed it off nice and quick.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:15:48
getting more btc for the dollar imo!!

They are bringing in some of that money with pyramid scheme-type buying.  My father-in-law bought into $1000, for a gift of cheap cosmetics and promised bonuses for recruiting new people and holding seminars.
He doesn't necessarily "understand" bitcoin or computers.  And my mother-in-law or own mother are leagues away from that comprehension.. so I think we got some time to grow.

unless they're sharing coins with some of us average joes. They're just an oversized check in a gas station window.

if they start creating digital currency wallets for their customers, and provided competitive transaction rates.  I guarantee the general public would consider using their local bank as a broker or portal for crypto.  Banks would have to downsize and eat their costs to compete. and yes they would eventually be totally fazed out.... like blockbuster video.

in other words, people sell themselves into debt slavery all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:18:55
my hopes is crypto forces banks to clean up their practices and forces debt slavery resolutions.  Throttling greed out of necessity due to competition.

I can visualize 60k better than 500,000k by 2020.  I can work modestly with those gains.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:13:55
interesting.  I've seen segwit discussed but not familiar with it.  thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:40:09
same here, monthly beer $$.. but patience and investing within one's means is what I have to keep reminding myself.  And to not to treat it like gambling, but rather donating to a cause.

I liked the initial reasons for occupy wall street.  But the occupy protest quickly became tainted and discredited.  Creating competition for wall street is probably the only way to force them to clean up their act.  So what occupy wall street initially set out to achieved is becoming possible with blockchain cryptos.

haha nice.  I wasn't successful when I tried.  I was just trying to buy a membership for a highspeed HD download site that stopped accepting paypal.

If you can handle conspiracy related content along with crypto talk, David Seaman of  (formally a HuffPost journalist) was an early promoter of crypto.

I'll easily spend a few $100 on booze going out a month.  $100 a month in to bitcoin, and just do more drinking a home.  




@_date: 2017-12-20 16:52:03
I agree.  Now I just want a Coinbase feature to pick which currencies show on the front page.  With all the negative content about BCH and user commentary I don't have any interest in going down that path.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:34:07
my tactic!  in hopes of buying more and pricier booze later!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:09:52
- Parents didn't have money.  
- Had to use student loans to pay for school even with a part-time job, and money ended up still being tight. 
- Introduce credit cards to 20 year old males who just want to have some fun while they're young.  
- Hope a new full-time job will help take a chunk out of your debt... it doesn't but hey, at least you have health benefits because that's important to a broke 20 year old!  
- Buy a respectable car, because your '91 Mercury Tracer doesn't purr like it once did.  
So you end up paying $1-$2k a month on student/auto/personal debt consolidation loans, credit cards, and hell paypal credit.  Figure there is always someone in deeper water (debt slavery)... drink a 40oz and feel better about stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:48:05
oh zing!  keeping this!
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:04:56
haha.  I love it!  Definitely a good rule of thumb.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:06:41
I'd say it's more of a con man vs a fool situation.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:32:37
hmm bitcoin and crypto generally aligns with opensource transparent accessibility.  Much like wikileaks and original occupy movement.  Seems like a lot of russia/alphabet agency crying and shill'n up in here.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:05:08
and if only I successfully bought bitcoin about 4 years ago when I tried, I'd be going out drinking to celebrate! hehe.  good luck to you and your crypto'n!
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:57:03
I just feel it brings new competition where historically competition has been squashed over the last couple centuries.  But this competition has the potential to force reform in our financial system.
And there are already some pyramid type schemes dealing with bitcoin.  People buying bitcoin though a company that gives them random gifts and will reward you more to subscribe new buyers of alleged bitcoin through their company.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:05:35
haha. so i'm only a month in, and these are the only two sites i'm set up with.  The patience in waiting for a transaction is tough, but i need to remember that i'm not day trading but looking to hold over time and invest modestly.
Is your complaint on the wait times?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:24:05
good thing that gold isn't backing the USD. Then we be in for a doozy! ^^/s

people are scared of what they don't understand.  and the whole "ignorance is bliss" is awesome until it's not.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:03:49
haha. exactly.. at $35 research sent me to a random 7-11 to purchase btc, but the machine didn't work.  Figured I was too late for 4 years.  bought at $9k and yeah it wasn't too late.

well, now i want to listen!! Thanks, Streisand!
@_date: 2018-11-07 19:46:49
listened to it, it was a very positive and realistic approach to how bitcoin isn't going to reach its full potential for a while.  And how it's possibly the most important product ever created and only becoming more stable with each day.  I love how they discuss the removal of a trust-based system.  Which is huge since in today's world so many things are require a certain level of "trust".  Decentralized and fully transparent... i'm all in.

couldn't tell you what the show Viper was about, but all I knew was I wanted that car!
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:39:28
for me "lambo" is a metaphor "paying off my student loans".
and "moon" is "debt-free with a house all paid off".
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:01:10
more optimistic than creating a savings account through a bank.
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:53:07
obviously!  Here's my upvote!
