Where does "market price" come from? Different exchanges are constantly at different prices. 
Supply and demand.
@_date: 2016-08-10 03:26:13
People seem to be forgetting that if a person is willing to pay, the market is supporting that price.

Yeah each year this has felt like a reach, and with the huge amount of money involved this time, compared to the previous January dips, I don't buy it.

Yeah with every passing year this excuse seems like more and more of a reach, especially this year with the market cap reduction, those are some massive numbers. There were so many shitcoins and so much FUD and BTC grew way too high too fast in the past few months, all of which happened every previous year preceding the January dip (minus the shitcoins, I've only recently gotten back into the crypto scene after taking a few years off and I was initially appalled at the amount of coins there are now.

If you don't have complete control of your bitcoins (private key)
**YOU DON'T OWN ANY BITCOINS**
They couldn't just closed up show and took everyone's money. That would be bad. This is not bad.

The past is unchangeable, dwelling on it only fosters a negative mindset. The future is determined by the present, which we happen to spend the entirety of our lives in. If you're anxious or nervous about something, do something now that will help you in the future.

No nota at all, but I miss the goold old days of BTC-e where you could make an account under a fake name and trade to you hearts content and (usually) get your funds out just fine. That was my dream crypto exchange solution, all of this institutionalizing and regulation have left me feeling quite disheartened.

Well I've envisioned massive implementation of small scale hydro mining huts working together as mining pools so I guess I was on the right track.

Won't that be tough when comparing cost of electricity?
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:15:49
$0.04/kwh is pretty good, I didn't realize it could get that cheap in the US. Still, I think China and Russia could do it for a fraction of that so... hey, maybe Bitcoin will be responsible for the discovery of fusion power and the end of the worlds energy problems.

Vermont is an amazing place, I feel very lucky to have family that was wise enough to invest in the land. I've got a ton of ideas about how to utilize the property, between the hydro opportunities and agroforestry options I see a lot of potential in those couple hundred acres, and by extension, a lot of the unused land in the state.
I'm currently living a more transient lifestyle, exploring the country, but I'd like to return to Vermont and follow up on some of these ideas eventually.

I grew up in Vermont, and my family owns a few hundred acres on a mountain, from near the top all the way down the valley. There is a small stream that drops 600' over the course of about a mile. It flows year round, I measured the flow rate and calculated possible power generation but can't find that document right now, but it was definitely enough to run at least a single home off of.
This isn't anything special, just one of probably thousands of locations like this in the state, and surely even more across the country, though Vermont is a good location for it. Otherwise, Vermont has pretty high electricity rates compared to the rest of the country. Montreal is just across the border, and I briefly looked into setting up a mining operation there as electricity rates are lower than anywhere in the US.

Good luck getting info from BTC-E.

Serious question: What if you wanted to do both? Just do the dollar cost averaging and put 50% in either figurative or literal cold storage and see what you can do with the other 50%? Or whatever percentage you see fit to "risk" by trading vs hodling.

So a few years back I decided to try to put together a timeline of meaningful events in the formative years of bitcoin. There were so many thefts/heists/scams early on that netted people tens of thousands of bitcoins, and I've been extremely bullish since day 1, so I wanted to gather some info. I put this together years ago, when the price wasn't anywhere near what it is now, and even then these were some of the biggest "heists" ever committed and were virtually unknown.
