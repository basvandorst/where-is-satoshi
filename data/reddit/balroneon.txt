yet there are no regulatory restrictions around what they may or may not be doing...   sorry.   This is an paul allen project/startup.   They have deep pockets.    Insider or not, in prinicple, they violated no laws

Actually, coinbase is an angel startup funded by Paul Allen's investment firm.   Deep pockets- Paul Allen is no joke.    All of his investments make huge gains.  Look it up

The reason I ask is that during turbotax interview, it asks if you have any gambling losses.  Even if I say I converted coin to fiat and then gambled it away..  its the same thing.  At least I think,

well, just throw some ball game tickets at your auditor and call it a day.
Seriously, you think an IRS auditor would actually have a clue?

The purchase was easier than paying via paypal!   
Edit: I do it for the love of bitcoin.  It would have been cheaper elsewhere.  But we have to show business bitcoin is viable.  Money speaks.. literally. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:15:31
As a professional developer, I can confirm this.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:15:31
Even messier when you throw bitcoin in the mix...   What would an auditor do?  Give up?  hehee

ut oh...    How do you prove you lost $300 in a slot machine?   Or at a roulette table.  Players club cards?   What if I don't have a players club card.  I can't see how to prove losses other than players club card which I don't show every time I sit at a table.

Or better yet, I transferred my coins from coinbase to coldstorage/offline personal wallet then lost the password and/or wallet files, etc. 
Computer crashed. whatever.  The coins are lost, is that a loss I can write off?
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:28:03
I'm at a loss too!
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:19:43
no but I'll take correlation.  That's good enough for me to add to my chart list to help make trades.

Love the impossible loopy-loop..  
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:45:51
People think sell now and time the bottom to get back in.  I've seen this a hundred times on the OTC.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:46:43
Lets say I gambled away all my coins.  Can I take the gambling loss?
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:03:01
Wtf?  Bitcoin can't solve world curtural issues....    Or can it?

So the us just hit 22 trillion debt, way above gdp.   If the us were a person, they couldn't stay sovereign.  However, the dollar is backed by the full faith of the government.   Even with the government shutdowns recently..  this actually means the full faith of the military, which doesn't shutdown.  As long as the us is the military superpower, the dollar will remain supreme.  Only a world war will change that, and yes, the dollars value is really the only reason there would EVER be a world war now a days...
Edit: a word

Anyone like me spend btc when overstock started accepting btc?   We all did it to support a large website in hopes others would follow suit.   My obligitary "spent 50k on a pizza story":   I spent like 400 bucks on stuff I didn't need, of course worth thousands lately.   It was worth it.
@_date: 2019-05-13 03:06:45
Exactly, technical analysis won't work as a price predictor with crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:00:37
This is probably the article to answer those who ask me where BTC gains its \*value\* and what its \*backed\* by.
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:27:32
Just a friendly reminder that Bitcoin HODLERS do NOT want a btc etf.   Nor do I as I want to see the moon sooner than later.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:59:19
True.  And the best thought is to look at yearly lows.  It never really retraces

Since ebay owns paypal or v/v, 10% decline in paypals fees would hurt the company's stock price and valuation.   Why would they want that?
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:29:43
Probably just another group pumping..  hope not.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:44:31
Oh snap, did not know that.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:57:50
At least wait until its one the national nightly news...  then its time to sell a bit

The company, Coinbase, is a product of the YCombinator! startup/funding machine.  Ycombinator is a Paul Graham entity who put out amazing and incredibly bleeding -edge technology companies such as airbnb, cloudkick, dropbox, OMGPOP, and reddit.. YES reddit is a success product of YCombinator!  See here  and here

I still wonder what we don't know.. ie TBTF's.  There has to be internal memos and such...
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:36:51
My guess is its a DDOS, as the database pool appears to run out of connections..  Its hit or miss, but sometimes you get through.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:29:25
What technologies are you using?  ASP, PHP, J2EE, python that sort of stuff.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:28:10
I was just thinking about another vehicle for them to make money off the masses?  Own the "float" you can manipluate.   China IMHO knows this.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:05:17
What kind of barriers are they facing?   I imagine the SEC?
@_date: 2013-03-24 02:48:37
I 100% agree.  Hell I'd take reddit gold as a reward  =)  
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:36:33
probably the last time I play, because now I'm bored.
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:32:14
Obviously you've never invested in the OTC or Pinksheets markets..  The pump and dump is the norm.  Just saying.
@_date: 2013-02-20 16:15:19
They are funded by YCombinator, of course they are legit.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:12:54
Sources from both of you!

I'm  on the leaderboards lol

Thanks for that link, didn't know about most of those.  
Ever read Paul Graham's essays?
