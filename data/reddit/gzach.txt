The problem is that I would need to verify the bitcoins validity after each password attempt. I don't know how long that would take.

I'm not sure how well brute force would work because I don't think I would be able to know I'd cracked it unless I verified the bitcoins themselves.

It was the first letter of every word in a paragraph, or possibly a few consecutive paragraphs. That's far from hundreds of millions of possibilities (because I kept the letters in order). But I don't know how I formatted my address when I interspersed it. I either put the address in front of the string of first letters, or after the string of first letters, or alternated the characters of each. But some of the address letters may have been capitalized. I don't know if I abbreviated "Drive" or not, or if I included commas or if I put hyphens or underscores between the parts of the address.

I know my bitcoin password. The problem is that I don't know the truecrypt password and I have no way to know if I have the right truecrypt password unless I check each attempt to see if it's actually bitcoins.

Thanks. I'll definitely check this out. But it's also possible it was more than one paragraph in the book (to get enough characters) and it's also possible I decided quotation marks could count as first letters, and that I tried to format my address creatively...I made it really extra specially strong...

The wallet is backed up. I don't know the exact number of characters, just that it was at least 50.

Thanks. I will look into this.
