Whats the general consensus of buying GDAX vs Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:35:47
That this all gained steam on a flux and that fundamental economics would tell you that it is going to slam down.  This probably isn't even the bottom.
Does bitcoin have a place in the future?  100%.  Will bitcoin go up? 100%.  Is it the future right now?  100% not.
Should have pulled your money out at the *obvious* peak.

What is bithumb and what does that mean?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:43:24
It's going to go back there just not for a long time
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:44:01
new to this, coinbase is saying buying/selling is disabled - that normal?  whats going on?  wheres waldo?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:49:48
I just don't think there is any overarching parallel you can draw between this given the lack of rigid regulation and the massive influx of buyers and the money they are bringing with them in doing that.  This stuff almost *has* to be the early stages.  I just don't see it going away.  It's going to have ebbs and woes, but I'll be damned if the world as an entirety is just going to walk away from something like this.

It's not dead it's just in a massive pullback/correction.  I think 100% it's going to eventually become the future of currency and disrupt the financial institution as we know it.  That said, a lot of people are flooding in for short term gains and they deserve to know what history has to say about bets like that.

Let's see where this wild ride goes
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:35:50
Can we all just agree the normal rules of finance/investing aren't necessarily applicable here?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:06:13
So what date do you sell
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:53:57
Okay that is a much more rational statement then what you were saying before.  Why dont you use this kind of rhetoric all the time?  Skepticism can be healthy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:38:10
Could have been higher though - if you knew what you were talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:43:32
Okay if you knew about this impending return then why did you hold at ~20k?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:00:13
Oh for sure.  I realize this is a new frontier not just in finance but in tech.  I'd imagine theyre probably having their engineering teams reinforce and optimize things in real time as this thing gets bigger and bigger.  
I was able to put 300$ in, I think that's a modest price for right now.  I realize nobody knows what's going to happen here - you think its going to continue to rally?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:32:06
Hey do you man, but that's a gamblers mentality - Not an investor's.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:47:48
So, what will be the resolution to this?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:54:27
Two important articles I read yesterday that made me pull my money out:
1. 
2.  
I don't want anyone to lose their money.  You are gambling right now.  If you're okay with losing any money you put in then I fully encourage you to do so.  But if you're on the fence about all this, and if losing whatever money you have is meaningful to you, then you should at least read those two pieces.
Just my two cents, wish you all the best.

That's like saying "I'm going to go out and play blackjack at the casino so I can invest in stocks with all I win"
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:45:50
"You're always going to be a poor, broke little bitch :)"
Who hurt you?
I got in at 13 and got out at 18 because I knew it was bound to fall.  It was plateauing.  I made about 3 grand.
Additionally, I'm 25 years old making 75k a year, so I'm on a pretty wealthy trajectory.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:32:08
I mean, we did tell you so
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:13:03
I spent all day yesterday trying to figure out if I should buy in, then i spent this morning mad at myself that I didn't buy in, then in bought in when it was at 17k and watched it plummet and was like "okay why did I do that" and now im watching it surge again and ive just kind of come to a very hard mental 'fuck it'. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:06:45
Its still going down though.  No one knows what the floor is but at this point it seems it can go down just as fast as it came up.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:17:01
I think you and me are agreeing and don't realize it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:58:30
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:03:40
oh.  in that case im 100% with you.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:31:58
Buyers for the sake of buying.  Bitcoin doesn't have real mass transactional value right now, so it's effectively useless.  It will go up in time, but right now is not the time to be in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:16:21
What does hodl mean?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:09:08
I'm aware.  Look if you think the articles and myself are BS that is 100% absolutely fine.  That's cool.  I cannot tell you what to do with your money. I just think everyone jumping in on this should at least read those and determine on their own whether or not those rules apply here.
I hope nobody takes this as a personal attack against their financial decisions - it's just something I think is worth reading.  Bitcoin is unprecedented, I get that.  These rules could perhaps not apply to it, nobody knows.  You should at least be armed with the knowledge of the history of what a bubble looks like and what causes it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:02:32
There is such a thing as safe investment but okay
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:27:13
Word.  Yeah I don't think I'm gonna work for short gains.  I bought right after dip today which I think is gonna help me out.  This is exhilarating
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:53:54
There has to be a chart for the amount of times the phrase hodl is used compared to the price of bitcoin.  I think that is the telling factor.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:06:57
Idk whats going on anymore i put in 300 bucks today im just gonna wait a week and come back and find out what happened to it
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:59:59
No I just don't want people to lose money irrationally.  If it goes up and people get rich I'm stoked just like look shit is really starting to look like a classic bubble.  Everyone said it wouldn't, yet here we are.  Do what you want with that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:11:45
This is what i was thinking.  The inexperience user is going to be freaked out by a price dip.  The experienced user is going to see this as an opportunity to buy cheap.  So confused by this comment.
