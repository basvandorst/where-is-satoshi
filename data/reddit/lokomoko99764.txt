This is one of the funniest points I see made about Bitcoin by people with little knowledge of economics and how currency works within economic systems. At the same time as proclaiming Bitcoin to be the best, modern medium of exchange, it's simultaneously advertised as a deflationary currency (as if that somehow lends to the medium of exchange idea). While I don't have anything against Bitcoin as a store of value, claiming that it's an ideal replacement for fiat currency in the global economy is laughable.
Your post is fantastic, definitely the most reasonable I've seen in this sub.

There's a difference between understanding a financial system and understanding a currency. Currencies (USD, GBP, Bitcoin etc.) are much easier to understand than financial systems. Furthermore, understanding how fiats are exchanged and, fundamentally, exist (that is, a physical note or figure in one's bank account), is much easier to comprehend compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is obviously a P2P system, where coins can't exist in a wallet unless the entire system agrees on how much and where that coin exists. It gets much more complicated than that at the technical level, which is why it's harder to understand than fiat, which can simply exist in your pocket without anyone else's consent.

You're invested in bitcoin and you're worried about it being jinxed? Jesus Christ.

Why not just put it in a regular 1-2% savings account? That's more interest per annum than I'd ever spend in a year, and there's no additional bullshit involved that you have to deal with (ie investment firms).

I assume he means just using basic wallet software and writing the key down physically, instead of leaving it in exchange cold wallets.

Disdaining rent-seeking behaviour isn't anti-capitalist.

In Australia it's government mandated. Can't take any out until you retire, sucks for us.
