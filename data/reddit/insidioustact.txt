Sure, that's what will make the difference between widespread adoption or not. It's not about the code, the currency, nothing except an "easy to use" term that actually makes things more confusing.

Not in mine. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I prefer to use sex, not gender.

Oh, if someone has money than who cares? Besides, my point was a little dramatic, I couldn't afford lunches like that, but you get my idea. It'd be strange in a bad way I think to receive a lunch bill that said 75,000. Or 250,000. Are those more realistic numbers for you?

Divorce can make people crazy. Hell, just breaking up can make people crazy. I broke it off with my ex because she moved halfway across the country. She came back in town and proceeded to break into my car... And say things like "why won't you let me love you." 
I loved the girl, would have probably ended up marrying her if she didn't move away. I trusted her completely, and she was a very rational person. Separation can make people crazy.

It's not even a real woman, he's a dude who chopped off his dick. Seriously.

Wait, so they're gonna do this and then I will no longer have a small number of BTC I will have a giant number of XBT? I can't choose to still talk about my small number of BTC, exchanges will no longer display trades in BTC, I can no longer buy BTC... That's disappointing.

Unless you day trade, of course. Then you don't really have a choice.

I was being sarcastic, it actually is stupid and unreasonable. 
Anyways, most of the world uses milli and micro prefixes, I don't think it would confuse people too much. But really, I just don't want you to tell me what to call them. Why try to force people to call it one thing? Language does it's own thing. Let me call them millibits when I mean mBTC, why does it have to be "correct?" I don't want to never see BTC again. I like BTC. BTC will never be worth a million dollars where it's incredibly rare to have a BTC.

I hope we have another Christmas Eve type night soon!

Fuck that. I will not be using "bits." It's stupid. I would never think it's reasonable to pay for a lunch with millions of bits, to see a check for lunch for millions of bits. Any argument that "someday it'll only be a couple bits for lunch for 5!" Is absolutely stupid, speculative, and unreasonable.
Just to be clear, I will keep using "bitcoin" to refer to the currency. I may say "micros," and "millis," and I may say microbit and millibit even though it's not "technically correct," because who gives a shit about whether it's technically correct. But I will always ask "what is that in bitcoins?"
@_date: 2014-10-03 19:17:08
That seems a silly argument. Assuming btc becomes the standard, people would use some altcoin to transfer money from btc&gt;altcoin&gt;transfer to secondary party&gt;btc. And if in person, gold would obviously be a possibility.

Oh you mean that bitcoin *just* has to triple in price, that's all? Just a quick tripling, and then it will be reasonable? Yeah that's not stupid or unreasonable at all. Sure, I want it to succeed. I'm invested in it's future. I don't want to deal with conversions and stupid forced colloquialisms that actually make it more unwieldy. Millibits or millibitcoins should be fine for now, then micros. Just call them millis and micros. Speech will do whatever it does, but don't try to actually force the user base to use a name.

Idk are the dudes boobs good news or not?

You must've been sad when you realized you could've had 250k without even selling at the peak...
@_date: 2015-11-04 07:36:21
Yep, I'd have probably sold too. $1000 is a lot of money to anyone, and nobody knows it's going higher. I just know it's hard for a lot of people, me included, to get past the what ifs...
BTC has definitely calmed me down when it comes to investments.

No, Gary Oldman! Or Paul Giamatti, he made a great bad guy in Shoot Em Up.

Steal is a good word for taxes as they are taken without permission, typically against one's will, and often used to fund things that one may disagree with.

A natural system cycles through inflation and deflation, overall leaving a very stable value to the currency. What's wrong with that?
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:56:02
If bitcoin becomes harder to get, it will be too much trouble for a large portion of the population and there will be no large pool of buyers. You can try to sell them for whatever you want, but if no one is willing to pay $1000 for them you won't sell. 
Besides, if say the USA were to outlaw all bitcoin transactions for any reason, all legit businesses would have to stop accepting bitcoin. Then, the only way you could spend it would be on the black market where goods are either stolen or otherwise illegal. As the majority of people don't deal on the black market, only a select few would have any use for them.

Strangely, I now somewhat support UGGs because of this...
