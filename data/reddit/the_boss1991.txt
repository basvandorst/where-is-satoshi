Kinda drunk.
Very happy I got a couple of special friends to invest in bitcoin. Tomorrow I've got my laser eye surgery appointment! Excited but scared. Hoping to pay with my bitcoin, sadly I'll have to demolish some of it and change it to GBP. But, bitcoin sets you free I suppose. How are you dude? Hodl is so much easier than I thought it would be, but I'll admit, checking its price is becoming more and more common. Wish I had the balls to just sit and wait. Hard though man. Well. Onwards and upwards into the future! Or... THE MOON. Hehe lovely idea. Anyway all, I wish you the most prosperity with you investments! Also, OP, you too mate.

With our bitcoin trillions, us Brits will rule the world... again. Hodl my boy, we'll hodl together.
