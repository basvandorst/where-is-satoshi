Here's my 2 mBits, and why I am choosing not to use this app. Before I begin, I understand having a jailbroken Iphone is very dangerous and this mostly applies to those with a jailbroken iphone. Coinbase Oauth API uses 2 keys, an api key, and a "refresh" key. Only the api key is needed to make requests upon your behalf but the api key expires after 2 hours, and needs to be refreshed using the refresh key. **anyone with your api and refresh key has unlimited access to your account**. Having an api key expire is an added layer of security, but is useless if the refresh key is also compromised. 
Bringing me to the coinbase app. Since I have a jailbroken Iphone, I dug into the files of the app and see what data it is storing. The file located at:
App ID/Library/Preferences/com.vilcsak.bitcoin2.plist
has two fields in plain text, **The API and Refresh keys**
Now I am not a mobile developer, and I understand you cannot one-way hash the keys, but there should be some level of encryption of these keys and they should not be stored in plain text. I have see similar apps having sensitive data implementing text obfuscation techniques.
Iphones are built upon Linux and anyone with reasonable scripting skills could copy that file and text/email it to them. I am not sure if apps are allowed access to other app's files (I would be interested in finding out), but if they are, this wouldn't stop say a bitcoin ticker app from stealing your API token. 
**TL;DR** If you're stupid enough to jailbreak your phone and want to use this app, I would think twice because your API tokens are stored in plain text.

This is disturbing.

I felt what he said was reassuring.

I met a rails developer for indiegogo last month , if I ever him, I'm definitely going to suggest it. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:18:22
Looks like they've taken notice.. hopefully

I don't want to sound like a cynical asshole, but at this point out of the 16.6 million followers, I can bet a large percentage of those followers that read the message already know about bitcoin. It's not news people, it's 2015, it's already mainstream.

Interesting. We can only hope that a different mining manufacturer can out-compete with Bitmain's hardware. That also means potential losses for miners if this doesn't happen in a timely manner. Fortunately it's a free market, unfortunately bitmain has a monopoly, and it takes time and huge amounts of capital to develop and manufacture such hardware. My nest egg is in bitcoin, so in need to start keeping an eye out. Much appreciate the clarification.

I'll admit, i've been out of the loop and trying to catch up on the BU drama. This may not be the correct thread to post in, but does anyone have any non-bias reasoning behind this unnecessary (yet extremely important) problem that is occurring with BU vs Core?
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:49:19
Thank you for that. Makes sense. I've heard SegWit referenced frequently, and this helps make the distinction of what is happening.
Mind if I ask a question, who supports what? Users support SegWit, but do miners support BU? As it would give miners so much power in delegating block size and tx fees.

Good call. Thank you for that tip. Understood about the call center, but surely there can be a better solution than a chatbot and twitter

It just wouldn't work. I made a post last week about having trouble with it. It worked with a new cable, but this morning it just wouldn't turn on and I was getting an error message. I had to open up my fireproof box to get the recovery seed. But once I recovered them I put them back into coinbase. They're safe until my new trezor comes, but my trust in coinbase is a little iffy. While I'm posting, is there a good trezor alternative? I could just read the FAQ ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:53:13
Started the process. Because it's a bank account, I need to fill out some paperwork. This was a rough morning, first my Trezor was bricked, and now this :p.

I have, and I entirely respect your point of view. I have hundreds of thousands invested into crypto. I lost a lot in the last week, but I’m holding strong, and will continue to hold. I also have made a lot in stocks. They’re both assets, and should be treated as such. The only drunken point that I’m poorly trying to make is that shit happens, and Bitcoin should not be viewed as a superior asset, and you shouldn’t put all your apples in one sandwich.
@_date: 2019-10-06 07:27:53
No it isn’t. This is the same shit articles that are posted by people that beg for the price to go up so they can say they were apart of something. I’ve made my cash in Bitcoin, and I’m weary of articles like this.
@_date: 2019-12-01 05:27:40
I bought at $20 and panic sold at $5. It’s all relative. (No I’m not a multimillionaire, yes I know
What could’ve been)
@_date: 2019-12-09 23:32:00
Should I post a mt gox screenshot ��
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:50:53
Agreed. Why stop there! $2 Million by 2020!. 
Take everything with a grain of salt people, this is still a sensitive application. Especially with all this drama occurring. There's always going to be conflicting arguments, and if certain solutions don't work, Bitcoin could suffer the opposite from these "predictions".

I’ve been a hodler for quite some time but I’ve always had them in exchanges (dumb I know). Do you mind explaining how you do this? I have a ledger nano, but after my trezor failed me I want to switch to a more primitive storage approach.

Not going to lie, you're not going to have a 100% decentralized service, when users are going to have to pay a single entity. 
Perhaps consider making that single entity... the blockchain. You could use the proof-of-burn strategy to prove a trader's reputation.

I'm trying chrome. Removed the extension, and re-installed it, still no luck. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:13:43
I was the Trezor cable! Slightly frayed, I should've known..
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:58:11
Quick edit:
Should I just leave my coins in coinbase?
(I know everyone will scream NO) but with the pending fork, I don't know if I should rush to unload my coins into a wallet that I dont know I trust
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:52:12
Just downloaded it! Thanks for the tip... 
My laptop still can't detect the trezor...  Might have to buy a new one and use my recovery seed
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:22:38
Just so happens that every wednesday, my company goes there for happy hour, just bought $20 worth of bitcoin! I can post a pic of it.
wasn't a fan of the fee though..
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:15:12
**Thanks for support all. It was the Trezor cable.**
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:03:57
does anyone know the details of that transaction? I'd love to see that
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:04:31
I was really short on cash this christmas (and I don't want to sell my 1.2btc) , and I gave my four family members $5 worth in the form of a paper wallet. They loved it, i've been babbling about bitcoins for years, so they know what they are. Our family doesn't care about material gifts.
Maybe I just have appreciative family members that aren't greedy?
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:57:27
Throwing in my 2 cents, I also would be interested (or other bitcoin related website ideas).
