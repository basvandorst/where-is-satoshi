Whoops. Thanks.

The address on the card is an address I generated.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:37:16
Thank you!

For common, everyday use, it's good enough.  I think if I find myself in flames hot enough to warp or melt this card, I have higher priorities.

I was about to ask where you got it, thanks for answering that question in the comments.
@_date: 2014-09-28 16:55:31
I got the second one.  Haven't heard anything about the July order.
@_date: 2014-09-04 17:54:15
Coming here really soon!
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:16:20
I'll give it a shot...

So -- when the US dumps the coins on the market and the value drops, will the Government turn around and buy more coins at the reduced prices?
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:35:14
OK -- I'll see if it hits my wallet -- might be there but not show up since it only goes to three decimal places.  We'll see what happens from there.
Thanks!

A Bitcoin card from cryptocard.co
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:26:00
When can I expect it in my wallet?
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:03:10
Do you use a credit card?  That number passes through several hands.  You  also think the address I gave them is:
1) The only one?
2) Unsecured?

I did about two weeks ago and again today. I show that the bitcoin was taken out of my Coinbase account. I haven't gotten a response yet. I am not horribly enthused with this company thus far.
@_date: 2014-09-28 16:25:06
Yep. Made from aluminum.
@_date: 2015-01-29 01:14:50
I will be cautiously optimistic.

couple that with the laser beam footage...

It's not about protection. It's about getting rid of the mom-and-pop bitcoin exchanges and giving their bank lobbyists billions of dollars.

What is segwit?

Worst dance craze ever.
