Tai isn't a scammer. He's just a good salesman. 
Csnt blame him for capitalizing on the bitcoin hype in 2017.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:38:56
Stock traders have been saying it for weeks now. Bitcoin needs a lower support level! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:45:28
Bitcoin fucking 20 bagged in stock terms that means it 20x your money not double or tripled but 20bagged! In ONE YEAR!!!!!
It was a pump from all angles, im beginning to think it was planned and people bought into it to now give bitcoin a sense off unreliability and untrustworthiness.

Negative dude, not enough days at this level for it be even moderate support. Dollar volume isn't significant. A good support level is tested time and time again meaning several days of trading.

Who cares anymore bitcoin hype is done. If you didn't buy in 2017 don't bother, start looking for the next hype and jump in early so you can profit.

Bitcoin was the biggest PUMP AND DUMP in recent times. I feel bad for people who bought at 20000 and under. Don't buy bitcoin its dumping all the way down to 3000. Everybody pumped this thing up like if it was a stock. People telling you to hold are either idiots or selling themselves. If you look at the charts from 2015-2017 the stock did a super nova and peaked at 20000, its waaaaaaay overextended and now its going back down to maybe 3000 level.

Dump dump dump... get out now
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:27:11
Its not a test. Dont get caught hodling the empty bags. This is dumping harder. You should've sold at 10000. Never buy HIGH, charts did a super nova this is a classic pump and dump.

Damn thanks i haven't seen that Elmo meme before. This was actually pretty hilarious.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:40:54
Look at the charts on tradingview. Bitcoin was in fact pumped up from 1000 to 20000. And now the hype is over and people realize it doesn't have the value everyone was selling it to have.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:21:41
This whole subreddit was a pump circle jerk. Only saying things to pump the price up and encourage people to bag hold cus that's what they are doing now. 2017 was the year of bitcoin now the price is gonna go back down to 3000. Everybody pumped bitcoin up it reached 20000!!! Imagine a 2 year investment from 2015 you are now a mega millionaire...the price needs to go back down to meaningful levels.

Bitcoin was the biggest pump and dump in recent times. Expect bitcoin to go down to 3000-5000.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:50:41
Losing money? You're doing that right...the year of bitcoin was 2017 you're already late to the party, the pump was all of 2017 and now its the dump.

@_date: 2018-02-02 05:37:49
Just my opinion. ive seen this super nova chart pattern plenty of times and i can see that it looks like the price was pumped up to unreasonable levels up to 20000$ and now its going to trickle down towards 3000-5000. The bitcoin chart is in the dump phase. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:42:25
Worlds greatest pump and dump.
