You can’t use the $100,000 it was never legal tender. You be stupid as hell to use any league tender above $100, because it’s worth more than face value, but a bank would have to accept a real $10,000 bill.

Right. But what you are referring to in your post is a 401k. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:25:43
How is a 401k any more at risk to a government seizure than an online bitcoin wallet? The government doesn’t own or administer my 401k  account.

But the volatility is counter productive to the lending side.  I can’t lend you a fixed bitcoin amount if I know the price in purchasing power is volatile. It has to be basically priced like an option.  I would price it at normal loan rate, say 5% for auto, but there would either have to be up front compensation or a higher rate to compensate for the implied volatility.  A loan denominated in a volatile asset becomes a loan and  a call to the lender and a put to the borrower, but the borrower would still get charged for volatility. I’m not anti bitcoin but you are not taking your logic all the way to the goal line.

I’m I dunno, buying a house or a car, or college.  If bitcoin is going to be a major or predominate currency it has to be able to facilitate lending.   Guess the question is if bitcoin is going to be currency why wouldn’t it need to be lent and borrowed?

Yes.  It was always accounted for.

At .01 a count bitcoin would have a market cap of 210,000 even after all the coins are mined. Realistically the amount available for a single transaction would be much less and if you needed to move even $20k you would be buying so many coins you would spike the price then when they were sold it would crater the price.  Sounds pretty terrible for money laundering at those levels.

Seriously?  Do you know anything?  FHA still does home loans with 3.5% down.  Also the average mortgage in the US at origination is $260K and the average down payment is $28K.

Do you worry about your return on the dollars you make at work?  Like “Why even pay me in USD if it’s not going to be worth $1.25 in a year?”  No.  If bitcoin is s currency then it is better served by having a stable price, not “generating returns” for investors.

And this isn't just theory or conjecture.  We can look at deflationary environments through history and see this how this has played out, and it is very damaging.

MSFT has decades of proven ability generate free cash flow and return it to shareholders.  Would you believe the same bout MSFT is the share price was $2,000 and the market cap $2T, with the same fundamentals?  
There is no known way to value bitcoin so saying you "believe in it, and that you think your belief will reward you" is pretty much exactly what I start think of as religion. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:12:55
I understand why you bought it.  The point is that currencies generally do not have an "expected return", they have purchasing power.  Currencies work best when that purchasing power is stable.  So if you are excited about bitcoin as a currency then that is largely incomparable with expecting the price to rise considerably.  
As I said, if you got paid in USD and one day you could buy a loaf of bread for $1, but in two weeks you could buy 4 loaves of bread with $1, and in a month a loaf of bread cost $5. Now think how this would apply to bigger ticket items like a house or apartment.  What if your monthly rent could fluctuate 50-100% monthly. This would wreak havoc on any budget planning,

No but you presumably believe in god because of some sort of future reward right? And you think non-believers will not receive the reward of heaven.   
Your car brings you money, but it does not matter if you wake up every morning believing your car won’t work or wishing you got the four door instead of 2.  OPs comment seems to insinuate that because he is a “believer” he will be rewarded.  That my friend is the central tenant for all religions (and scams).

"If your going to do that, then I'm going to say that Bitcoin is valuable because criminals can use it to launder money, therefore it has intrinsic value."
talk about terrible logic.  Intrinsic value means that it has practical applications that have some inherent value.  Gold has an intrinsic value, I agree not nearly what the market price is, but it has one regardless of the price. 
Bitcoin cannot have intrinsic value "because criminals can use it to launder money".  They can only use it to launder money if it has value, if bitcoin were at $.01 a coin it would then have no value for money laundering, hence money laundering does not create intrinsic value, rather it is reliant on it.

You know people buy lambos from lottery winnings too, do you "excpect"  a return from a lottery ticket?  Its not that I am saying YOU won't get a return, or that bitcoin will never go up in value.  The idea that its adoption as a currency is what should drive the value, is faulty reasoning if you ask me.  Pointing to other people that have made money in through the same investment at a different point in time, is also faulty reasoning.

You will be able to say all of the same things if the price drops to $10 a coin.

Do you believe that your belief in science or your car will lead to monetary or spiritual rewards because you believe? Believing in self is a major tenant of some religions already. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:07:18
First of all I am not saying Bitcoin is a religion.  It is the mentality of OP (and some others i have heard talk about Bitcoin) that has very strong similarities to religion IMHO.  People believe the earth is flat, I don't think that is a religion, nor do I think any of your examples constitutes religion.  Never did I say believing something constitutes religion.  When it starts getting into the grey area is when "faith" starts to become involved.  Consider OP's comment:


He believes in the technology, but what else does he believe?  That "believers will be rewarded handsomely".  No maybe he has cracked the code, that I have seen no-one else crack, which is how you put an intrinsic discounted value on an asset that doesn't generate income, doesn't store value well, and doesn't have much of a practical use at this time. 
Since of all analysis's i have read about Bitcoin I have not seen one single one that can make a compelling case for a solid valuation.  Shoot OP makes no indication he is even using TA to guess where the price will go.  
So what makes him so sure that "believers" will be rewarded?  Though he doesn't say it explicitly it sounds a lot like faith to me. 
All of the examples of belief you gave do not involve faith for your belief to be true, or is your utility of the subject effected by wether you "believe" or not.  For example your car, you actually believing your car will work has no bearing on wether it will actually work.  You could absolutely believe your car will break down tomorrow every day until it does, but I think if someone told you "my car broke down today, but I believe in the technology so I believe it will work tomorrow"  you would probably think they are crazy.  They didn't say it, but they are implying that their faith in their car alone will make it work. If you thought this way about your car then, yes I would say that is bordering on religion.

This!  Just waiting for the market to get some momentum back then I’m getting in.  JK
Seriously I agree with everything you said. I don’t think you can “Time” the market.  Value it?  Sure, but as you said where is my edge?  Can I really know enough about the business prospects of all the companies making up an index to make a more accurate value than the market?  Probably not.  Do I think the market is 100% efficient on every stock from $10M market cap to $800B, no. Can you sometimes find companies or a situation on a specific security where the market is being irrational. Yes. But once again it’s not easy and you won’t always be right.  It takes a ton of learning, a ton of research, and a lot of thinking about thinking.

Ok sure.  Tell me some day traders that have accumulated huge sums of wealth by constantly buying and selling stocks ( not for other people like a fund manager)? I mean if Joe Schmoe can do it surely someone with a good chunk of capital would be a billionaire by day trading over the last 40 years. 
To address what you edited. Making 1% day trading is not making a living no matter how much capital you start with. If you don’t make what you can get in a CD then you are losing money.

Ok so show me one example of a person who can prove that they have consistently over a long period of time made market beating returns from day trading?  You all seem so sure these people are out there, lets see them.  Yes if you have been day trading bitcoin through the run up, you have probably been able to make a living, but a rising tide lifts all ships.  I have a feeeling you guys defending day traders are young and don't realize that since the 80's with every assets bubble there have been "day traders" that seemed to make great profits, but then every time it all falls apart that generation of day traders go by the wayside, and its a few years before a new generation is lured by this concept. 
Also your example about scale is ridiculous.  With a market cap of $117B there should be plenty of liquidity for a small to medium size fund to apply any and all strategies that work for a Joe Schmoe.  Further when the entirety of the financial markets is considered, even small positions spread across many securities could solve the liquidity problem you refer too.  
So once again I ask, show any level of capital investment where a person has made market beating returns over a greater than 10 year period of time by day trading.   
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:28:16

This is true.  When he left Apple he started two companies, Pixar and Next.  Next devolved a Unix based OS that would form the basis for OSX.  Next was a failure though and even after Apple bought them and brought Jobs back he owned a small percentage of Apple shares.  He got some big option awards after the ipod.  Still I don’t think he ever got back up above 10% or so ownership.

The thing is though your analogy fails because one you expect me to believe these people are out there, yet you don’t actually know of any.  Nobody takes anything to a day trader, they have no specialty except supposed apothecary.  Why do people play slots all the time or bet on horse races, or lottery do you think these are ways to make a living?  “Because people do it, it must be profitable” is some stretched logic

it was a total typo.  I have no idea why I put that. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:22:27
So in all of that explanation I took this: you can’t point to one single person that has successfully beat the market over the long term by day trading. Sounds like a lot of “faith” that people actually make money doing this.  I bet there are a bunch of people that are convinced they make money with a strategy on slots too.
