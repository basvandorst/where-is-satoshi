Many Americans are scared. The media is doing all they can to make it seem as if ISIS is moving into the house across the street and recruiting our children. If that's all you hear 24/7 from the news, and you didn't know any different, I couldn't really fault you for supporting some crazy shit.
People are frustrated and politicians are using that frustration for their own goals. It's fucked up, but this is what happens when the media encourages it and your average citizen believes it.

CryptoLocker is nasty. I helped one guy get rid of it, by selling him the bitcoins to pay the ransom. Just a couple days ago a friend on Facebook was asking how to get rid of it. She seemed to think that her friends who was good with computers could help her, even after I explained what it was. She didn't think paying the ransom would work, but also didn't want to lose all of her info. I don't think she's done anything about it.

Let me see if I understand. All numbers and percentages made up.
1. I go to a store, purchase a $100 item with BTC, and the merchant uses Coinbase -&gt; dollar which takes 1%, but the merchant charges me the extra percent, for a total of $101 worth of BTC.
2. I still want to keep my original amount of BTC, so I purchase $101 worth of BTC from Coinbase, for a 1% fee.
3. End of the day, merchant has made exactly $100, Coinbase has made 2% of $101 (1% for merchant's exchange, 1% for me purchasing more BTC), and I've essentially spent $102 for a $100 item?
The fact that the customer is paying for the merchant to accept BTC is why you say the following?:

I've done nearly 100 trades in two months of LocalBitcoins. I like what Mycelium is doing, but no one is using it here. I checked every trader's profile within 300km of me (also in the midwest) and not a single person has any trades through Mycelium. If it weren't limited to in-person trades I think people would use it much more.

There's a story on reddit somewhere of a college kid who was contacted by an older guy through localbitcoins. The older guy was in his 60s I believe, and clearly didn't know much about bitcoin, despite wanting to buy several hundred dollars worth. The kid asked why he wanted the bitcoins and the older guy told him that he had this virus, CryptoLocker.
The same exact thing happened to me. It was so similar that it weirder me out. Both me and the guy from the story were able to help the older guys out, because the contents of their computers were worth more to them than the money. Last February I think the ransom was around $500.

Overdraw fees with the bank, then Coinbase would charge your credit card instead. There's a higher fee associated with that from Coinbase, and apparently according to another comment in this thread they will lock your account until you can prove you won't let it happen again.

Mycelium has the really cool local trading feature, and plenty of people on reddit are talking about it, but the app lacks something that LocalBitcoins provides: online trading. With about 100 trades total on LocalBitcoins, I've only traded in person with six different people.
It's great because I don't have to leave my house, I don't have to worry about meeting strange people, or have to deal with people not showing up at the agreed upon time.
The Mycelium app has been dead silent for the past month. I can't find anyone within 300km who has a single trade. Even the BIG LocalBitcoin traders in my area don't have a single trade on Mycelium.
The app, right now, simply isn't as useful as LocalBitcoins.

We're butting heads over the definition of support. I feel, as do a few others here, that in order to support something you need to do more than just agree with it, or believe in it.

[Coinbase]( makes it pretty simple. You verify your bank account (can be done in a few seconds with your bank login info), then you can buy bitcoins using your checking account. It takes around 5-7 days from when you hit "buy" from when you get your coins, but the price is locked in at the moment of buying, so there's no worry about getting stuck with a higher price.
Or you can check out [localbitcoins]( You can buy from anyone else using the site, anywhere in the country in a variety of ways, but there's also a cash option, if you're willing to meet someone face-to-face. This is a good way to buy bitcoins if you don't think your bank will allow the transaction to go through, or if you're 14 and can't open a checking account, or if you're hiding your cocaine habit from your spouse, etc.

I can not do Thing and claim that I've done Thing and you see no problem with this?

I'm still fairly new at bitcoin. I've been reading and watching for quite a while, but have only made a single purchase from coinbase so far.
There's a link in the sidebar titled [How to buy bitcoins]( that I think will help.

One of those benefits is that we're able to do with our money what we want, without someone else standing over our shoulder holding the reins.

Suddenly, just agreeing with something means that you're lending your support. Instead of actually lending support.

Exponential growth on a logarithmic scale is roughly linear, if I remember correctly. That's probably what he mixed up. Unless I mixed it up.

There's really no way to tell if they're just sitting on those addresses or if they've lost the private keys. Not until bitcoins move from those addresses anyways.

Not to get all meme-y on you, but you keep using the word "support," and it does not mean "to agree with."
To bear the weight of; to hold up. To give assistance.
Not "to believe in." You aren't supporting something if you aren't doing anything.

I love the idea of Gyft, but I've been unable to install it on my phone, which would be the easiest way to make use of the service. I keep getting the "package file invalid" error. I've talked to support about it, and I know it isn't a problem with Gyft itself, but rather with the Android Market, but it still bums me out.
I should clarify: I've done every fix I can find online to get rid of the error, from clearing the cache to uninstalling the market updates, to connecting using a VPN... Nothing has worked. If anyone knows of something that might, I'd love to try it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:44:29
Yes, this is exactly what I've been saying.


You're claiming that people *say* they support something, even if they don't actually lend support to it?
This has literally been my argument all evening.
You're so dead set on me being wrong that you don't even realize that you're now saying everything I've been saying.

Ok, that makes a lot of sense. I know with the price nearing $1000/BTC there are a lot of people wanting to switch to uBTC as the default unit. Just didn't realize this post was about that.

It's totally OK. I can use Gyft on my computer in the meantime. I don't often install apps on my phone, so I'd never ran into this problem before. I just wish some of the fixes that worked for other people worked for me.

1. Decide to buy bitcoins
2. Sign up on Coinbase
3. Verifying my information takes about 2 minutes
4. Bought bitcoins

The best, easiest way to get bitcoin now is to buy it. Mining will likely be unprofitable for someone just getting into it.

If you were able to do this, the trust placed in the Bitcoin protocol would very quickly plummet. Bitcoin wouldn't be worth anything if it were possible to reverse engineer private keys from their public keys.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:24:35
Nope. Check the dropdown list on ways to pay on localbitcoins. At the bottom should be "cash." You can meet with people in person to buy bitcoins. No need for bank transfers or escrow.
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:56:49
So what if a user buys his threshold for the day, then buys a bit more. He sees the price start to drop... and he can just cancel his buy, even 20 hours later?
I like the idea of this, but it could be exploited to react better to the market.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:46:30
Approved currencies that have been backed by governments have failed. Bitcoin not being backed by a government doesn't mean that it will fail.
And isn't the value of a thing simply the agreed upon price that people are willing to pay? If no one were willing to pay $1000 per bitcoin then it wouldn't be trading at $1000.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:26:06
You can get verified one of two ways: You can let them make two small random deposits to your account, then tell them what those amounts were, or you can provide your bank login info. I did the latter, and was verified instantly. Some people don't like the idea of supplying their login info though, so they use the first method, which I imagine takes a few days.

It's really not worth it. You'll do their little surveys and fill out the forms and you'll literally get half a cent's worth of bitcoins. Really your cheapest and easiest bet will be to just buy them.

Can't hurt to check. You may be surprised. I live near a semi-major metropolitan area, but there are a few people buying/selling ~50-100 miles away in smaller areas.
Worst case scenario you may have to drive a bit, but it could also be a good opportunity to set yourself up as a bitcoin seller in your area and keep a bit of profit for yourself.

We're butting heads over the definition of support. I feel, as do a few others here, that in order to support something you need to do more than just agree with it, or believe in it.
I have no doubt that one can agree with the gay rights movement and believe in the cause, but to support something means you have to actively *do* something for it.

Coinbase is great, but it isn't an exchange, they're more like a middleman, and they're not what you're looking for. Try CampBX or Bitstamp.

Why not spend all of your fiat right now, as it will be worth less as time goes on?
I suppose it depends on how you view bitcoin. Is it an investment vehicle, or is it a system of payment? Of course it's both, but if you're worried about spending today when tomorrow you could buy more, then it sounds like you're treating it more as an investment and not as a currency. And if that's true, then when *will* you spend it? Once the price levels out? Once it hits that certain number?
But I may be talking out of my ass. I've never purchased anything with bitcoin, and am currently just using it as an investment.

Because the transaction with your bank still takes a few days.
You can do instant buys with coinbase if you verify a credit card though, that way they know that they'll get the money for sure, as banks sometimes halt payments to bitcoin exchanges. They're actually instant, as far as I know, though I haven't used it yet.

I think the prevailing thought is that it *is* subject to capital gains tax, but that it's up to you to declare/pay it, as it's slightly more difficult for the IRS to find out about. But not impossible, and you don't want them to find out that you've hidden it from them.

You can use localbitcoins to exchange in person for cash. It may be a little pricier to exchange for smaller amounts, but it would completely get rid of the Paypal problem.

And this is why it shouldn't be called a bit. It's already a unit used in computing and Bitcoin is confusing enough for non-techy people as it is.
