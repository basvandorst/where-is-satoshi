I hope that's a joke.  If not, I would suggest you pull out of bitcoin and focus on stabilizing rather than fantasizing about how you can double down on your money.  That's the same mentality people have when they are behind on a payment and go to the casino to make up for it.
Investing in something this volatile is fun if you have extra cash to burn or simply as a more interesting way of gambling, but if you are going to struggle financially if this doesn't work out, I would personally get out of it now, even if that means getting out at a loss.
If at some point you stabilize to the point where you're not worried about rent, I would still suggest you save some money up as an emergency fund.  And if you want to keep investing at that point, buying safe stocks is a much better bet.
Missing out on an opportunity to get much more out of your money sucks, but struggling to make it from pay check to pay check fucks up your life.
Anyway, I'm not trying to lecture you.  I'm just saying my point of view and what I would do so you can at least think it through from another perspective.  I hope things work out for you.

I did buy at multiple prices as I mentioned.  Some orders weren't far off in price from others, but I don't see how it matters either way.  If I want to invest $100 and I put it all in at $19000 or instead $10 at a time in a $18950-$19050 range, why does that matter?
Unless you're talking about over the course of days.  I did split it up over two days, but I didn't want to keep waiting because I didn't put in a substantial amount and like I said, I didn't want to miss the boat once again.  I would have been really pissed off if I held back my already limited amount and watched it go up and never come back (like it has since it hit $10,000, although hopefully it doesn't go back down there!)

The price was going up for a long time, you’re acting as if you can just know when it is going up and when it will come down.  If you somehow know that, please let me know where it is going from this point and how you know.
I watched it from $5k.  It went up to $10k quite quickly and stayed around there.  It didn’t go back down to $5k, so if I applied your logic then (if I had money to buy it at that point) I would have said “oh it just skyrocketed, I will wait until it goes back down to something like $6.5k and then watched it go to $13k instead.  Then said the same thing and watched it go to $15k and stay around there for a bit.  Then $19k where it was floating for a while with a high of $20k.  I was actually watching it for a little while and eventually said fuck it I don’t know where it’s going and don’t want to miss out anymore.  
Again, I can’t just see it go up and say “I know it will come down now.”  And I even mentioned that I didn’t go all in too.  I bought at $19k, $18k and $16k knowing it may come down and I can buy more.  What else would you suggest?

But if the price is still good when it's "on sale" then why not keep shopping there?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:41:34
That's a non-statement.  How is that relevant to anything having to do with shopping and finding good prices?
If the final price they offer is better than that of another store, you're scaring yourself out of saving money for no reason.  Or do you have a real reason?
And obviously you recognized their "manipulation" so you know their sales aren't real.  Now with that information you can still compare prices without getting overly excited by the fact that they say it's on sale.

At this point I need to hold on and hope for the best.  I didn’t put much into it and I can afford to lose it all.  Having it go to $0 would be annoying, but I would lose my mind if I sold it now to cut my lossses and watched it jump to $25k after how many opportunities I already missed out.

Same.  After thinking it was ridiculous at $5k and then seeing it at $10k, I finally decided to go in but it took some time for money to transfer.  Then I was waiting for a dip as it kept climbing all the way up to $20k.  I figured if I keep waiting I might completely miss the boat, so I said fuck it and got some over 19k, then a bit more over 18k and then more at 16k.
I feel your pain...
I don't have much invested and I can afford to lose it all, but nevertheless once I started losing money I realized how much I regretted finally getting into it when I had so many doubts earlier.  Hopefully it will bounce back...

Never a good sign of what?

I already moved bitcoin to my wallet and got the full amount.  I don't understand how half the people on this subreddit talk about all kinds of fees.  I did some research, found I can load money into gdax and trade without fees, and then move it to my wallet for no fees.  I'm actually shocked by the lack of fees, yet I come here and I see constant complaining about it.

If both car shops do an equally good job, but one lists it's regular price at 10% more than the competition, but always has their service on sale for 10% less than the competition, then sure I would go to the cheaper one.
And yeah all marketing can be seen as manipulative if you spin it that way.  I'm sure the places you go have items listed at a "regular" price that's higher than the average price they can sell it at, just so they can also put it on sale at times to make it look very attractive when they do, all while capitalizing on people who don't have the patience to wait for a sale.
Is that much better?  Do you see it as manipulative for them to sell it at a higher price than they need to, or no?
