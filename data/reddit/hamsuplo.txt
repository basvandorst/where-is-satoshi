You're right good point

What do you guys think of this suit? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:03:50
He makes his own chips. He owns megabigpower.com and has partnered with BitFury to design and sell his own ASICs.

We do not know if he does have the money to protect himself. First we don't know if he really is the true Satoshi Nakamoto. The article was pure speculation, we have yet to have any proof. Second, we do not know if he has the private key to his BTC wallet and if he can access it. Third, if he were to dump his BTCs it would cause instability in the system rendering the value of BTC to a fraction of what it's worth. His $400 million could easily be $400,000 or less.

It's a pink sheet stock so it's listed on the OTC exchange so you must have a brokerage account that allows you to trade on the OTC Markets.

1) Where the rates align on both buy and sell side, a trade occurs. For example you have a seller who places a sell order for 200k DOGE at 200 satoshi, however on the buy side the closest rate is 199 there isn't going to be any trades happening. However say a new buyer enters the market and executes a buy order for 100k DOGE at 200 satoshi, then the seller is able to execute his order of 200 satoshi (however he will only fill 1/2 of his order since the buyer bought only 100K DOGE). So essentially the "rates" are what people are willing to buy or sell their DOGE at.
2) Kind of explaiend above, a trade happens when buyer and seller agree on the price (200 satoshi once the buyer comes into the market)
3) Essentially an exchange is a middle man to help people FIND other people to make a trade happen. People post their offers up and if the offers on both buy and sell side match, then the trade is executed automatically. The exchange is a match maker.

What's wrong with Overstock?
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:29:37
There are two main ones. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:14:19
You can't explain that.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:54:43
Well they also claim that they violated any fiduciary responsibilities that they had for someone who has possession of other's money.
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:38:56
Yeah but the thing with Overstock wasn't sensationalized, they went full out in support of Bitcoin.

What is at .0001? The parent company Tranzbyte is at $0.052 right now. For anyone wondering the stock ticker symbol is ERBB and it's listed on the OTC market.

What exactly are extra hash rates if they are dedicated miners themselves? 
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:18:44
I wouldn't label the venture itself a failure. It helped bitcoin gain major popularity and mainstream attention.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:48:37
That doesn't mean he doesn't have private body guards.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:54:02
There are two types of bankruptcy. Do you know which type they filed for?
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:05:04
What do you mean by match vs acceptable? Trades wont occur until two parties put in an order (one seller and one buyer) at the same price (200 satoshi in this case).

I've been looking into bitstamp. How long do coins take to settle? Is it instant so that I can withdraw my coins to a personal wallet?
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:03:58
History my friend. There are visible patterns with price movements. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:37:16
You don't think his granddaughter doesn't have security that protects her? Nakamoto hasn't cashed out on any of his BTC as far as we know and therefore he doesn't have money to hire any personal guards for him let alone his family. Disowning their family won't do anything. It still paints a target on his whole family.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:05:02
It could have been taken out of context anyways. They could have been talking about his past work experience and not bitcoin all together.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:07:47
So if I wire the money I can get coins usually within an hour to my own personal bitcoin wallet?
What if i use an ACH transfer as wiring money usually incurs a $30 charge from the bank? How long does that take? 4 days?
Edit: Also what are your limits?
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:51:00
I would like to know too? Do they just do chargebacks and open a dispute?
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:22:01
"Experdited Mailing!"

Their basis is that they have servers in US (Massachusetts) and they are doing business in the US. Also they are claiming because of this they have a fiduciary responsibility with their money (as does any exchange such as a commodities exchange).
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:23:24
Why wouldn't his family need protection? People know the identities and location of all his children and wife. Now they can hold any one of them hostage for his BTC fortune.
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:18:27
Essentially Crypsty is all limit orders as you get to specify your price so there are no "market" orders however you can set it for the "market" price to essentially get a market order.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:23:42
But that doesn't relate to purchasing a contract. Fronting money to cover costs would qualify for equity in the machines. You only purchased a lease on a machine.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:17:28
Yes but the return for mining is BTC for themselves. What exactly are "extra" hashrates if they were making money from hashing themselves?
@_date: 2015-04-11 15:48:12
What are you talking about... Why on earth would banks want to drop retail customers? That's where they even get their money to lend out to begin with. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:17:00
Because everyone here is just mad they didn't jump in on the Bitcoin ship when it was hovering below 100$.
