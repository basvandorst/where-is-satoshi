I'm here to make money.

This was an amazing talk.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:37:47
Where is this 6-7k correction?????? We're waiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiting 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:31:17
I took all profits at $12,900 and was very happy with myself yesterday. Woke up this morning and now I hate myself. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:59:11
Not a weak hand. I'm a speculator with entry and exit points.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:20
I sold all at $12,900 o_O 
On a positive note, I made more profit in BTC in 3 months then I've made on my entire stock portfolio in 3 years with 5x's the money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:24:41
Just sold at $12,900. It was a wild ride up but my hands aren't that strong to hold any longer. Take my profits and pay some bills.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:10
NO IM NOT. Know why??! Because I sold yesterday at $12.9, took profits. Bought back in at $16.4 today and was ready to take profits again at $19.2 when the platform crashed and I've yet to access my money again.
Guess that's what I get for trying to swing trade BTC.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:34:02
I think you're confused between what a weak hand and a speculator/trader is.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:38:03
I'd have to disagree. As someone holding bitcoin I've never had so much anxiety in my life watching charts til 3am.
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:18:38
So this may be a dumb question but I would appreciate it if someone could answer this. Why would such a large company offer a bitcoin discount with the currency being so volatile? This goes for ANYONE accepting bitcoin (not just tigerdirect). Are they somehow hedging this? 
@_date: 2014-06-04 01:57:35
Paypal friends + family is $0 cost. I was not aware of the geographical limitations.
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:17:25
PayPal can do everything you just mentioned. I'm all for bitcoin but I don't believe these are the major selling points here. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:30:50
Makes perfect sense. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-06-03 13:29:07
I suggest you get on a plane and fly to Japan**
@_date: 2014-08-19 14:45:31
And you think a crypto-currency is the solution? 
@_date: 2017-01-30 23:36:43
Not everyone loses money during a market downturn. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:07:11
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:37:14
RemindMe! 6 months
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:45:56
Same here! Happy I didn't. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:11:50
This is me... and then 5 minutes later I have my mouse over the sell max button. Then over buy max.
I'm losing my fucking mind. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:42:11
This however, is exactly the type of stuff that STOPS me from investing in BC. Fighting the worlds largest finance firms isn't on my top priority list. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:09:11
Now they'll look to you to pay. "bro, it's like you just got free money.. common!" 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:54:32
20 minutes?! Coinbase was down for me for almost 4 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:19:50
I'm happy buying both. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:11:05


That's certainly one way to look at it but right now it's just way to speculative for me. I have other vehicles I use for "insurance policies". I think one day BC will be one but just not at this time. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:31:36
Because I think there is a time and a place for every investment. I didn't say that I didn't agree with BC, I thought BC was a failure, etc. I'm actually very intrigued and like the idea a lot. That still doesn't mean I'm willing to put my money into it (yet). I apologize, I didn't know we all had to be holders of BC to join the sub.
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:14:25
... and? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:31:12
yes, yes we did. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:57:17
RemindMe! 4 years
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:00:06
You didn't *really* think governments are just going to roll over for this, did ya?
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:48:08
Until it's $8k and you're still saying the same thing.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:57:03
Here I am thinking I finally understand BTC (somewhat) and now you a$$holes start talking about forks and shit. I give up.
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:41:41
As someone who made their very first crypto purchase today... through CB... this scares me.
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:44:59
care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:18:12
what a headline
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:16:53
Who said he is unwilling to invest in one? What the hell do you think he's asking for?
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:21:43
I completely understand (and even agree) but there is still no such thing as a fixed currency. Just because the number on your $10 bill doesn't change; doesn't mean it's still worth $10. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:42:52
I'm just trying to keep it simple and get my point across without too much effort. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:06:33
Since when does 20% swings not constitute as volatile? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:20:49
There is no such thing as a fixed currency.
