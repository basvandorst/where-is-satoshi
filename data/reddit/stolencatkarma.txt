in GDAX you withdraw and deposit. choose your coinbase account.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:38:41
withdraw from gdax, it's free dude.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:56:06
Most traders get behind a few coins and dont switch. There's really no switching into all these new shitcoins as they are called.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:37:55
is there another site to withdraw usd to a visa debit? bitpay and swift are the only two i've found.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:03:23
Please open source. Not worth the risk. Sorry.
@_date: 2014-12-17 13:55:41
Got a link? I'd like to set one up.
@_date: 2014-11-25 17:39:48
Going by the ad its 10% on a good day.
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:33:51
I can't take you seriously with that name. Lol
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:14:40
can it block based on keywords or just per user?
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:56:09

Looks awesome but I'm on a windows phone. :/ good luck!!
@_date: 2014-11-22 19:47:02
Oops. Not that old. :D
@_date: 2014-11-27 02:13:51
Even just making a metal slug from silver and stamping its weight on it?
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:16:41
When you had to pick up the phone and place it on the modem. Ahhh.
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:30:53
Wet blanket much? 
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:07:13
I think most people are familiar with exchanging currency. I can't think of any currency exchange that charges no fees.
@_date: 2014-12-09 12:50:11
Maybe I should've titled it my favorite. I dont own the site.
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:45:47
Oh god. That brings back memories. Haven't played fnm in about 10 years.
@_date: 2014-11-24 22:42:29
Sending and converting are two different steps
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:15:54
can an individual coin money? like melt down silver and use it as currency?
@_date: 2014-12-20 14:33:12
How much is three 10ths of a cent?
@_date: 2014-12-20 14:19:04
I would imagine stuff gets posted to reddit from github when it matters. No sense putting the cart before the horse.
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:24:08
No idea. I don't claim to be a lawyer like 90% of reddit. Lol

@_date: 2014-12-20 14:44:52
I'm not understanding this either. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:08:56
Exactly. If I get roi in 3 years ill be amazed. (if ever)
@_date: 2014-11-25 17:00:16
Last time I checked $5 to send $50 is 10%. And that's a promotion. Bank transfer or bitcoin is much cheaper.
@_date: 2014-12-07 14:07:04
Humans have evolved this far because of our ability to cooperate. Racism usually leads to less cooperation and more fighting. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 13:40:21
So I can't use it in stores that expect usd. But can barter with it. That's what I think it means to me.
@_date: 2014-12-11 13:20:50
Windows store too. Not just Xbox.
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:59:57
Ok. Im not mining. Zeushash lets you buy mining power. So I tested it with $20. Just giving out my results. Trying to be helpful is all.
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:38:35
It's Tuesday somewhere!
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:13:43
That. And you don't need to convert it to spend it. You need to find a store that takes it. But the same goes for USD or any currency. So realistically you can send it for a penny and spend it with no fees. Which IS much cheaper then WU.
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:25:35
i was thinking of sending him some tips. =D
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:11:09
I think Satoshi is a self aware computer program. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:03:12
I actually can't comment on this because I've never had a problem that required support. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:53:05
I still find it amazing it's worth over a dollar. 
The first successful digital community monetary system. 
It spans all borders and unites people.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:17:02
i would've been okay with them if they had started from scratch. just saying "hey everyone who had BTC has the same amount of BCC" is just plain wrong and i wont support it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:12:36
Yeah bit taking others hard work and time, copying it and saying this has value is BS to me. I wont touch it. To each their own though
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:58:47
Talk to a financial planner Monday. Be smart don't rush things.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:45:43
what on earth made you buy in when BTC tripled in a month? there's no way that's sustainable. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:39:47
nothing. i lost 20$ to these scammers. just keep trying to warn people i guess.
i bought 20$ when they started up. payed out 2$ in BTC and shutdown my permanent 24/7 miner.
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:22:10
I see. Thanks for the serious and informative reply. I guess this makes sense but what happens when there's no more blocks to mine? Will it just end up being 0btc+fees?
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:47:18
So if I understand this right. As a solo miner I can only make transaction fees if I actually find the 25btc in the block? 
@_date: 2013-10-28 03:29:56
I used it for awhile. Good experience. Initially deposited btc. Traded to ltc then back to btc. Withdrew to coinbase. Added a bank account and cashed out 130$. Overall great experience.
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:31:47
Ah. No sidebar on my phone. Thanks. :)
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:33:05
I'm not talking about mining but just collecting transaction fees from the block chain. I know pools make money not only from found blocks but also transaction fees.
