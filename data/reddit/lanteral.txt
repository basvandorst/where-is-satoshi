You know he left PayPal and went to Facebook to lead mobile payments, right?

It's a chicken and egg problem; they don't want to deal with the volatility, fraud, liability, etc., so they'd want a partner like Visa or PayPal to handle the logistics. As you correctly point out, they could attempt to cut out the middleman, but you underestimate the amount of red tape. Once someone like Amazon starts handling a currency exchange, here come the regulators. It's a huge gamble for an established and booming company to move into this area, considering the Feds could nullify all of your work in an instant. As to why PayPal doesn't get in on the action, considering their level of expertise in the identity and fraud domains, is beyond me.

If these are numbered in order of importance, this is the biggest crock of shit I've ever read. Having an emergency fund comes after investing in Bitcoin? Jesus.

It seems all they do is wait for Gox or BTC-e to take a stand on an issue, and then quickly follow suit. Probably makes sense, why shake the boat when they can address more pertinent issues relating to their business vs the ecosphere.

At least with Coinbase being an American company (backed by YC even), you have the possible recourse of legal action; compare this to their competitors, good luck taking them to court.

Roger that, you said you had a tight budget, so I assumed your savings were a bit thin.

It will be interesting to see what Visa does about this because today, if they catch a merchant offering a discount for paying with cash, they'll revoke the merchants ability to accept Visa (no joke). I imagine they'll enact a similar provision for Bitcoin.

The answer to this question is ridiculously obvious: do you think the largest ecommerce site in the world is going to trust some fly by night company with zero reputation of being able to scale? Until an established player comes into the Bitcoin fold, one that has decades of experience in status quo exchanges and payment processing, Amazon will never ink a deal.

I'd recommend deleting this post if you're correct. CoinBase reps crawl these boards and if they can tie your username on reddit to your account, you can be sure they'll reverse it.

If you don't have an emergency fund of at least 3 months, then please don't throw money at Bitcoin.

You can't possibly have enough invested to necessitate your level of concern/anxiety.
