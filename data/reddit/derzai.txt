Their regular commission is 0.55 of all trades. However, CampBX has an affiliate program where if you join via the affiliate link you get 10% off of commissions for life, and some of your commissions go to the affiliate.
Here is my link, feel free to use: 
If you subscribe, we both benefit.

I am leaning towards exactly this type of reaction. I was curious however, if it would help spread the word about Bitcoin and popularize it, if one could do something like bitcointip on Facebook

Why wouldn't the initial miner focus on profit? For every 1 Linus Torvalds there are thousands of profit-minded opportunists. 
Secondly, any scheme which allows control of initial mint by one person(entity) will automatically be regarded as a Ponzi scheme (and rightly so). This is why people mistrust Ripple, btw.
Thirdly, the problem is getting something for nothing. In Bitcoin ecosystem, you get coins for mining, aka supporting the infrastructure, the peer-to-peer validation system. So, in return for that, you get coins. Why should the first miner or whoever he deems appropriate as his first buyers, get the upper hand on the market? So it's basic psychology of fairness. 
Fourthly, if all the coins are pre-mined, there is no further incentive to get into the system, except via buying. However, each new system needs a steady influx of supporting agents (aka miners). This is essentially re-iterating the last point, but from the support structure perspective.
I think these are the most salient points in the argument against pre-mined currency.

Cool, thanks. Hope it goes through. I wouldn't put a lot of coins on FB, but  I think it's a great way to evangelize BTC in the most effective way there is - donation :).

I am also going to recommend CampBX. I've been using them for about a month now, and it's pretty hassle-free. ACH deposits and withdrawals from US banks. Wires. They charge 0.55% commission. However, if you use an an affiliate link to sign up, you get 10% off their regular commissions for life. Here is mine:  . Feel free to use :)

1. Take the meds, buddy. It should help. Also, get your facts straight. If you click on the link, it tells you right there, that your account qualifies for a discount on commissions. 
2. I also first signed up with CampBX without an affiliate link. So? Big deal, I created another account through an affiliate, and transferred my BTC there. 
 
This is mostly for the benefit of other people that might read this thread... Cheers.
