Regulatory issues in those countries.  Coinbase is a USA company.

"Afford to lose" is such a... weird concept.  Better is identify a vice or habit you'd like to change and channel that money to this.  Smoking.  Lotto.  Drinking/Drugs.  Books you never read.
IF it goes butt-up, you still win.

And things like the B3 alt coin trades in sub-satoshi values.
[B3 currently trades at 2.739e-09 BTC](

*Dead*lines sharpen one's intention and make fast the desire to reach.

Know it is a term thrown around quite often and yes this is semantics.  Don't trust me, look at history... People can "afford" to lose much more than they think.  Regardless, it's a wonky concept/view especially when it comes to personal finance.  Where the goal is to make smart decisions not throw it in the wind. It's your hard earned money and more importantly TIME, be _invested_ in a profitable outcome.
Afford to lose is more of a walking through a casino attitude... and lose you will.
Think like Yoda: Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. 
DO or DO NOT.  There is NO TRY.

Somebody find this guy a Crystal Ball!  Stat!
  
 (And the answer is "YES".  Always "YES".)

The property doesn't necessarily need to be a residence (and in fact shouldn't, or shouldn't be *your* residence) but should be income producing.  The other concerns... though true enough a risk, can be mitigated with a bit of due diligence.

This is something that most don't get about "debt".  It isn't in and of itself bad/evil.  You must weigh it against the opportunity cost of not using the debt.
Though will say you made a smart choice.  Nobody has a crystal ball, congratulations on no Education Debt!

In fairness... a wire transfer is in that same time frame.  But locked within bank hours and pay a slight premium flat fee.

Retire and travel the world on 17k/yr?    
  
Are you an r/frugal wizard?  
   
  
(but I hear ya, let's say moderately well for 10yr and probably after 3 or 4 you'll be over this "travel the world" thing with plenty of cash left)
EDIT: Have to admit to a US centrist idea of costs... and a somewhat "luxury" idea of stay and travel.  True enough much of the world isn't as costly and certainly a great time can be had not staying in resorts and doing gross USA Tourista kind of things.  Thank you for the reality check.  Still, slow burning 17k/yr... will need to reevaluate my life to make that work... and a fair enough endeavor to think about.

"Best" is a bit nebulous... Why is Coinbase out of favor with you?  They make it easy enough to buy and transfer.
Guess you could nerd out with others IRL and trade cash for coin... but you need to be comfortable with that aspect and all the issues therein.  And if it is the fees that bother you about Coinbase... now you understand the value that institutions bring to the equation.  And rightfully so they deserve to get paid... as much as CB is asking? Market will decide.  But with something that has the appreciation rate of BTC, seems worrying about a few bucks in transaction fees is a bit penny-wise pound foolish.
Point being, the more secure, trusted, and convenient a transaction is, the more it will cost.  So either you take on the risk/hassle or you pay someone else to take it on.

And 20% of the 50% for taxes...

@_date: 2017-11-06 14:43:35
Right now... think my plan would be to look for everyway possible to spend the BTC directly.  The less main stream the better.  Even local meetups to sell BTC for cash.
It is a ~20% kicker after all.  Maybe even sell for cash at premium all things considered.

You really don't need to... they are doing a good job of saying what they say all by them lonesome.
I mean really, no different than someone buying Apple stock because the "iXphone" hype.
Doesn't matter the reason they come really, some (most) will stay and when they start digging deeper and sure they will see the light as most who've come for similar reasons and figured out... this is the real deal.  It will go up and down, just like anything of any value does in a localized period of time.  But in the long haul, there is the vacuum of space, a moon and so so much technology and utility to yet even be imagined.
The future is[...](

Currency traders pay taxes of course.  If you profit (net gain) yes.  If you loose (net loss) yes* again, but it is a negative income.
*Though .GOV won't be upset if you don't claim it.
If you are talking about going to like a kiosk?  Same but think in general that system is built such a way you always loose... and then there are fees.  Even if you did come out ahead, say you traded directly with a local and negotiated a very favorable rate (say a Venezuelan was desperate to off load local fiat for USD and you were looking to spend that local fiat immediately so it had more value to you than him), it would be small and obscure, honor system.  But "technically" you would be expected to claim it if over some IRS specified amount. Not an accountant.

Perfect.  Let's sticky this and close up shop.
