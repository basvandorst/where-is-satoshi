I've always been intrigued with questions of consciousness and the nature of reality. But what in heck does this have to do with Bitcoin. I think someone has had a darkmarket delivery recently ;)

You're analogy is to weak too even make fun of. And buy the time you get done reading this, I hope your grammar panties are wadded up real tight
@_date: 2015-10-25 06:13:03
Would you consider breaking this up into readable paragraphs?
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:18:46

I move to an area that only has DSL connection. Until about a week ago I was only getting 5 mbps downloads and .8 uploads. 3 days ago I was able to upgrade to 20 mbps down and 5 mbps up I plan on starting another node.

What irony I find in you're name.

Its possible that electrum is no syncing with its servers properly. Have you checked your balance via your last receiving address on a site like blockchain.info?
Edit: just saw you mentioned you can find it on "blockchain".

Remember when everyone was saying "Bitcoin lets you transfer money instantly with zero fees".
