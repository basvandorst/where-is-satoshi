Yeah, what do they think this is, some kind of decentralized cryptocurrency that anyone with a computer can help protect? Get real, noobs!

Yeah, because happening once is a mistake, but TWO TIMES is just outrageous and confirms that they are doing it maliciously.
I'll bet the NSA spends a lot of money figuring out how to break this custom noise generator. Too bad they don't know how to defeat basic security seals, or they would've gotten away with it!

    "Hey, how do I get on the Internet here?"
    "It's easy! You just pay Bitcoins to this address and-"
    "Where do I get Bitcoins?"
    "You go to this website and-"
    "...but...Internet"
    "Oh, right. Here you can use mine to buy them. But then you'll have to wait a few days...so..."
    "Fuck it, I'm going to read Newsweek."

Ooo! Reasoning with parents! Let me try:
Your parents don't want you to gamble with your friends because 1. They don't want you to lose your money on a bad hand 2. they don't want you to be "exposed to drugs and other bad guys" that gamble 3. They don't understand Texas holdem but they are pretty sure its a scam.
This is what you propose to your parents.... Dear mommydaddy, If you don't want to let me take opportunities with my own money then you should offer to play me and my friends in a game of poker starting with my savings. If poker is a good way to make money, you will have to give me more money, if it's not, then you will get to keep the money when I go broke. That way I 1. learn financial responsibility 2. give any losses to you not "druggie/bullies/friends" 3. You get to learn about poker, and the lesson that wisdom and age do not go hand in hand.
