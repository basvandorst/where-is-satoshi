I got an email from coindex that their beta version has exchange integration so it will automatically see you coins and update your portfolio automatically.
I would love it if you did that! Also, I don't have all my coins on an exchange so it would be huge if I could put in wallet addresses and it would get the value from the blockchain! I'd pay at least $20 for that kind of app.

It wasn't a serious comment, it was a ridiculous reply to a ridiculous comment that bitcoin was a ponzi scheme. Obviously banks aren't actual ponzi schemes, if for no other reason than ponzi schemes are illegal and banks are reasonably well regulated.

The exchange wallet might support 8 decimal places of coins, but their trading platform might only support 4 or 5 decimal places. So, you can't trade the remaining three decimal places that is in your wallet. These small amounts of coins that are left over and are difficult to deal with are called "dust". He's just asking for some good way to clear that dust.

What isn't a ponzi scheme tho? When you deposit $1000 in a regular bank, they can turn around and lend out $900. With fractional reserve banking they only have to keep 10% of balances in reserve. If more than 10% of people want their money (assuming everyone has the same amount of money) then they can't pay.

Sorry for your loss. If you're in Socal I can help you in person if you want.
Either way, and assuming you're in the US... I would setup an account with gemini.com immediately. That is going to be your cheapest option for getting that bitcoin into cash in your bank account and it is going to take a week or more to get verified on gemini so you'll want to get that ball rolling asap.
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:44:06


I agree with you in general, but that's not what ponzi scheme means. A ponzi scheme is something that pays out earnings with other people's money... which is literally what the banks do. It seems to work fine and I don't inherently have a problem with it, just funny to think about it that way since bitcoin is the opposite... all of the value is accounted for all the time. Not to mention, bitcoin was literally invented to get away from banks.

That's fine. Should anything go wrong at least she'll know who I am. She can come to my house if she wants and then she'll know where I live, and I think when she sees my house she'll realize I have no need to steal from anyone. I guess if she's really worried she could hire a police officer to come with her... although that's expensive she should probably do that no matter who helps her. Anyone shady wouldn't want the police present.

Ya, my problem was that I transferred the coins in from an external wallet so they automatically go to the main account when you do that. So, those coins are stuck. I moved all my other coins to another exchange yesterday, hope to have better luck there.

It's gone 6x since I bought it a month ago. Anything that goes 6x in a month is very useful to me. Not to mention, it's the most widely used crypto coin among major financial institutions. So, apparently it's useful for actual value transfer. Even if you don't like ripple, you can't ignore that it is giving crypto some mainstream credibility.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:15:07
Not to mention ubiquity. Of all the cryptocurrencies, it's the easiest to buy -- every bitcoin ATM, local bitcoiner and exchange supports it. *Almost* everyone who buys alt coins buys bitcoin first, so it gets a natural amount of demand and trade volume from that alone.

I don't feel so bad for myself now. I saw it going down, RSI started to turn around and started trending back up at about $17,900 so I bought a couple thousand dollars worth, then it almost immediately dropped to $16,800... then further. Fuck.

Surprisingly, the alienware laptops are pretty competitively priced if you're comparing them to similar systems from other manufacturers.

I don't think it's because it's a grey area either. I think Apple likes to protect their customers from themselves.
If a customer is not happy with a purchase in the app store, they'll refund it. There's no way they can protect people from losing money with a bitcoin app so they just block it completely. I think they'll eventually lighten up on the idea once the masses better understand BTC.

I work in computer science and we often use data or services from external systems that we don't control. We are very careful about how our business relies on those systems because we've been burned before when those external systems have changed something that we depend on.
So, if your entire business is built around the blockchain then you could get burned if the core devs agree on a change that you can't accomodate... for example if they removed a feature you need. The opposite might be true too, where you need a feature or performance improvement that the blockchain doesn't currently offer.
They're not reinventing the wheel, they just want their own wheel that they can steer.

Ya, this is crazy. Fraud will run rampant without the ability for merchants to encrypt transactions with card owners.

I have to admit, after watching a number of SpaceX launches now and seeing how most of the team is very young and then seeing not one, but two falcon 9 rockets come back to earth and land upright simultaneously on adjacent pads, and the fact that the company has only been around for 15 years... it really made me wonder what NASA was doing for space travel the past 15 years?
At first that made me think negatively about NASA, but then I sat back and realized that everything is iterative. Without NASA, there would be no moon landing. Without NASA, there would be no robots on mars. Without NASA, there would be no... spacex.
SpaceX doesn't make NASA look bad, SpaceX is the little brother with big shoes to fill, and it's doing a damn fine job. That's not a slight on NASA, that's a compliment, an homage -- spacex is simply the next giant leap for mankind.

I feel sorry for the people who didn't recognize what they're getting into with that project. Even if they thought this was some brilliant idea, that's a leadership disaster.
When a person who is successful in the industry reaches out to offer some free advice, including a book recommendation, he assumes she's trying to get a piece of the action rather than reading the first paragraph, where she basically says she frequently ran into people just like him and wants to give them fair warning of what they're up against before they make too many common mistakes.
Even though he completely disagreed with her, a smart business person would recognize that nurturing a friendship with her could be extremely valuable and not very difficult since she seemed more than willing to offer advice. Instead, he burns that bridge as quickly as possible.

I think you're talking about the chip, not the pin. In the US, you can sign for a debit transaction just like a credit card but in Canada you must always enter your pin number to make a transaction. The pin is obviously more secure, so the fees are lower because there is less risk for the merchant provider.
But, the chip is a good point too, that makes it even more secure and the US is even further behind on that.

I don't think they would encourage people moving the bitcoins out of their system. But, even if the did... then they'd at least be getting in on *some* of the action instead of none of it (if they decide they're not going to accept the new global currency).

The other mistake they made was the recent change so the buy price is the current value at the time a transaction completes.
I can understand they want to protect themselves against fraud by delaying a purchase, and they want to protect themselves against value fluctuation... but if they want to do that then they should secure the coins immediately so they can be transferred to the customer at the buy price that was agreed to up front. 
They're getting all the benefit by making customers wait days, even weeks, (depending on their trust level) and then they're throwing the fluctuation risk on the customer too. There has to be some give and take. If they want the benefit of reduced risk, they should have to carry the trade volume during the trust period.

It's a fair point, and I think you're right that some people probably do look at it that way. But, it should also be noted that although digital, bitcoin can also provide a fairly high degree of anonymity if used right.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:05:53
I formatted it so it's a bit easier for people to read:
I am very new to Bitcoins, but I learned a lot from the dot.com crash and I see a lot of similarities. I’d like to share what I have learned as it applies to Bitcoins, for the new Bitcoin thousandaires. 
1) Do not spend more than you can afford to lose! For a good guide, imagine planning for a weekend in Vegas or a day at the track or a poker outing. What is the most that you would want to gamble? If you spent more than twice that much on Bitcoins, you may want to rethink your strategy. 
2) Have an exit strategy, a backup exit strategy, and test them out. Most people think this is a bubble, but I can tell you that if there isn’t a burst, there will be a correction. And the higher and faster things rise, the harder they fall. Once a correction is triggered, people will panic, and trading sites will be overloaded and even crash. trading sites may even go bankrupt. 
New accounts can be slow to be approved or delayed indefinitely. This is why you should have at least 2 trading accounts made, and linked to a bank account. And test them, do a small trade. 
Imagine having 2000 Bitcoins, and it reaches $500. Then it starts falling, so you want to cash out at least half because you want to buy a house. It’s at 400, so you decide to sell. You register for a trading account. That takes a few hours to be approved. It’s at 350. You transfer Bitcoins. It takes 3 hours. 325. You make a trade. The site crashes before it’s done. Next day, it is back up, and we are at 275. You make the trade at 250. You could have had it at 350 had you registered. 
You finally get the money and have it transferred. Hey, $250,000 isn’t bad. But there is a transfer limit. You are not verified, so you transfer $10,000, the site’s daily limit. And you wait a week. And then you find out your bank does not accept transfers to savings accounts, only checking accounts. And by the time you fix this up, the trading site has gone bankrupt, and it takes you 3 years to finally get a claim in and get 20 cents on the dollar. Most could have been avoided by testing out the system with 0.1 Bitcoins. 
Now by all means, support Bitcoins, start using them for trades, and encourage vendors to accept them. This ‘bubble’ is only a small part of the big picture. But for those of you who have $40K in bitcoins and only $300 in your pocket, well, this advice is for you.
@_date: 2013-10-04 04:18:25
Ya, it's a good point... especially since they've apparently been onto SR for a number of months now.
@_date: 2013-09-11 13:29:53
I think you're right that some people would use it that way. But, the really savvy people are going to avoid paypal all together and then the beginners are only going to use paypal because they're already comfortable with it, it's nicely integrated with ebay and the various "protection" schemes they advertise.
But, even if everyone used it the way you describe... it's still worth it for them to add one more currency to the [24 currencies they already support]( so they don't miss the bitcoin boat completely and can at least get a some piece of it.
If they do it right, meaning their fees are competitive with other bitcoin services, they might get more than a small piece due to their current position in the online currency trade.
That said, there are other companies who are already more popular than paypal or bitcoin for person to person transfers (although not in the US since we're so far behind in banking compared to most other first world countries). I wouldn't be surprised to see one of those organizations emerge as a strong BTC/cash exchange in the future.
@_date: 2013-10-11 15:18:14


One benefit is that it would require electronic theft to take your wallet. If my house is broken into or my phone is lost, my BTC is still in blockchain.info.
So, is there a good way to have the online backup and a local copy? Ideally, you'd have the security of a local wallet but the contingency of an offsite backup.

@_date: 2013-12-31 15:00:14


NFC is great for quickly and easily transmitting short blocks of data in very short ranges. But it doesn't offer enough in the way of security for it to be a good long term replacement for magnetic cards. Chip and PIN credit/debit cards are more secure and already in fairly wide circulation (not as much in the US, but they're the standard in every other developed country and Chip cards will be standard in the US by the end of 2015).
So, I suspect most big companies who are going to try to build the payment solution of the future (and all the hardware to go with it) are probably going to want something more compelling than NFC if you're expecting people to use it over Chip and PIN cards.

So, I think it's valid to bring it up at the hearing and a well thought out response is needed to put everyone at ease or least allow them to see how the same concern applies to other monetary instruments. I wish the video continued to the response.

Sure, I think that is probably a better choice than the macbook *for some people*. I'm not saying the macbook wins in all comparisons. I'm just saying the comparison has to be a little deeper than CPU, RAM and SDD to understand the price difference.
For one thing, the thin and light isn't well regarded for it's battery life (about 3 hours). Macbooks have 7+ hours of battery life. That's important to some people (and it's not important to others), and that's just one thing... there are a number of other differences that people might be willing to pay more for in the macbook. But some people won't, and that means the macbook isn't suited to their needs.

I think because there's very little they can do to prevent people from using bitcoin.

They don't want Americans to buy *any* drugs outside of the US, because most drugs are much cheaper outside of the US.
Canadian pharmacies are popular because the drugs are the same ones you get in the US and they're far cheaper. If people are getting their drugs cheaper, big pharma is not making as much money.

I was thinking the same thing and I think it's exactly what they would do. They're already basically a digital wallet, escrow service and currency exchange... what's one more currency?

I guess they don't really need the money that badly then. If I was begging for money and somebody offered to pay me in a way I wouldn't accept, and it wouldn't cost me much of anything to accept it, I'd be on that immediately.

I agree the process is a pain. But, it can be done in less than 3 days. I mean, I did bitinstant yesterday and it only took about an hour to fund my mtgox account and buy bitcoin. That said, an hour is still waaaaaay too long and I shouldn't have to leave my house to do it.

This is a good point. I think the other part is that they're not ready to make a lot of money on it yet... that will likely come in the form of escrow, because paypal likes to control the release/refund of the payment.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:55:01
Obviously, there is money to be made from selling us bitcoins. If paypal can be the exchange, then they don't have to worry about chargebacks and it gives us one more option.

This is probably your best argument. But, look at the banner that's running on the deals blog right now. They might be planning to swap that for a bitcoin banner that leads to the bitcoin page. In other words, they want to capture the deals blog traffic for other purposes.

Could get a certified check, or both of you go to an actual bank and do a wire transfer, getting a confirmation that shows both accounts and the amount transfered.
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:00:49
I suspect paypal would accept bitcoins and hold them (like they do with some current payments) until the buyer leaves a positive review. Currently this only applies to newer sellers, but with bitcoins they could apply it to everyone.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:22:42


Agreed, and it could be very fast if they wanted it to be. I can make a paypal transaction using my checking account and it is an instant debit transaction from my bank account.
From a technical standpoint, I don't see why they couldn't do the same for buying bitcoin, assuming they're acting as the exchange. Since they sent you the bitcoin, they know it was sent and they don't have to worry about chargebacks.
If paypal embraces bitcoin, it could be exactly what they need to grow their business further.

If you're comparing a good PC laptop to a macbook, I don't think this is true. I paid more for my thinkpad than my macbook pro retina and the hardware is pretty comparable... except the keyboard and screen on the macbook are much better, and the thinkpad literally weighs twice as much.

It's relevant to bitcoin in at least two ways:
1. Satoshi was nominated, so many bitcoin people are probably interested to know if he won and if not, who he lost to.
2. Snowden's heroic exposure of the government's immoral behavior likely contributed to increased interest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-07 16:32:38


Exactly. Chances are good he spent some of it already. Since he doesn't have another job he would have had to pay rent and stuff... and he probably spent a lot of them before they were worth today's value.
@_date: 2013-09-12 14:16:34


No, that was the part I disagreed with.
There's no doubt you can buy PCs with similar internal hardware specs for less, but business grade PCs are pretty comparable in price. Mac's are business grade too... with unix under the hood and a friendly UI on top, that's why pretty much every engineer at google uses them. That's why so many offices and retail stores use them.
The operating system is an important part of the Mac value proposition, simply comparing hardware specs isn't a complete comparison. They're friendly for beginners and have a unix terminal for engineers. But, they're not perfect for everyone (just like Windows PCs).

It is believed that apple is working on a Bluetooth LE based payment solution, and since their phones have supported it for a number of years they'll have a reasonably large ready base if that's true.
At this point, only a few recent Android devices support the full Bluetooth LE spec, but this trend will likely continue since it's a higher potential protocol for payments than NFC.

I don't want to put words in your mouth, so I'll ask... is it fair to say you're not buying bitcoins because you think the demand for it will be too high?
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:23:25


Ya, I'm assuming they would just apply their existing escrow ("buyer protection") to all bitcoin transactions.

PayPal is owned by eBay. If bitcoin can be used to pay for PayPal transactions (like your credit card can), then eBay does accept bitcoin.

The BTC exchanges take a commission when you buy/trade BTC. Why do you have a problem when PayPal takes a commission on a trade (money for goods)?
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:06:16
Even if you hate paypal, and many of us do, there's no question it's the most popular digital wallet out there. If they bring bitcoin to millions of users, I think it can only be good for bitcoin in the end.

Fair enough. I don't think anybody here, other than perhaps restaurant owners, likes the idea of paying people below minimum wage and then expecting tips.

You might not know this but I'll tell you that there have been performance problems with exchanges in the past. 
Systems have been scaled up and bitcoin is about 1000% more valuable than back then. It could be a problem again, but history has shown that it doesn't have a long term impact on the value or your ability to buy/sell.
Going forward, I think it could go two ways. 
1. You're right, the system fails and everybody who is highly invested in bitcoin throws their money away and gives up on it while the issue is being fixed. 
2. You're wrong, most people do the same thing they did last time, hold their coins and you miss an opportunity for gains.

And yet, all of these regulations still weren't the *right* regulations to prevent the financial crisis that countries like Canada mostly avoided (2% dip) and fully recovered from long ago.
