Or the guys who don't follow Bitcoin all that much but talk a big game..

 But wouldn't the price of all USDT paired cryptos go up as people dumped their USDT into other coins?  And would the price of cryptos stay inflated as people had no/a slow way to cash out into fiat?
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:45:49
to be fair there's a rumor circulating that coincheck was just hacked.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:10:02
 But there's nothing really stopping everyone from sending their crypto to gdax and draining their coffers of real USD, right?  (Assuming USDT imploded)

Apparently you're pretty safe against QCing if you never send from your cold storage address, and if you do send a fraction of your BTC, you send the rest to a new address that's never been sent from.  (Public key is never revealed that way)

I think Alex is first of many more people who will be purged by big tech in an effort for them to have more control over who comes into power.  100% they brainstormed about what they could have done differently in 2016 and are acting on it for 2020

you don't know a thing about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 08:14:10
Censorship resistance is Bitcoin's greatest feature.  Anyone can freely use it unless miners collude to not process transactions for a specific address, but I doubt they'd find that kind of consensus for literally anything so the economic incentive is to keep validating without discrimination.

If you're super old school just say you last it on gox and tell them you could have been a millionaire if it wasn't for those pesky hackers.
I'm a lot like Andreas,  I've been talking about it for years, people think I'm a millionaire, but secretly I was hardly buying at any large scale.
@_date: 2018-08-31 08:15:53
how do remittances with better margins actually help btc price?  they're out of fiat and back in quickly. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 02:22:41
I feel a bit like Andreas.  I shilled bitcoin when it was ranging around $300 despite not owning any at the time.  (I realize he actually used it as money) but we both had less than people expected.

Creating a fake demand on other "stable" coins (ETH and Monero) makes BTC look weaker.

@_date: 2017-11-30 02:58:47
I would assume it's any transaction that involves BTC moving from one address to another.  If you were to purchase Bitcoin from coinbase, I'm not sure if they actually send the BTC from one wallet address to another, or just keep it in one large wallet, and use their own internal ledger to keep track of balances.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:01:00
Because it's easier to say and write something shorter and with less syllables.  I think most people who haven't went all-in on a single coin don't gave a shit.

Upward price movement is a combination of new money flowing in and people trading on margin  (Borrowing BTC to buy more, no new money entering the ecosystem with this method.)  Then at a certain point, the new money slows down, people margin trading react by also stopping.  Now that everyone realizes the price is stagnating, they begin to take profits.  People margin trading see the price dropping and they begin to short bitcoin, causing the price to further drop.  The market will fluctuate in between support levels (how low it will go) and resistance levels (how high it can go before peaking.)  Successful traders predict these ranges and try buying and selling in between them.

Too many leveraged short positions (the market is expecting downturn,  so people bet on the price going down,  but they get greedy and bet more than they have) so they are now getting short squeezed by bigger fish.   It helps when positive news events are on the horizon,  like Consensus, and Fidelity investments opening up Bitcoin trading,  to get retail investors to fomo in to further help the shorters get squeezed.   
I'm happy to be wrong,  as my net worth will go up,  but I think these are largely sell the news events,  and we will see prices fall to the low 4ks again if not further.  Adoption isnt rising so its not sustainable.   The 2020 halvening will be another big pump event,  question is do we just continue upwards until then,  or is an event 1 year away too long to keep rallying towards?

Depends how much BTC you have.  I personally keep 1 BTC in cold storage as an insurance policy and the rest of my stack is strictly for gaining USD value.  buying $7000 and selling $7500 would be a successful trade for me.  My next move would be looking for another setup to go long again.  
The one goal I left 2017 with was to never have to experience seeing my portfolio go down in USD value again.  Will I outperform just holding Bitcoin?  Who *really* knows, but I've hedged my bets.
Similar reason a YouTube personality might publically be bearish even if it's going against the trend.  Either: They're correct and were 1 of the few people who called it, or they're wrong, and rich.
