you need 1000 dash to run a masternode? that would be 67,000 dollars
i dont think i like any of the masternode ideas...
bitcoin simple secure main chain,then go wild on the layers and room for millions of unique ideas without risking everyone

you should build it anyway and put it out in the proper honest and moral way...its your reputation thats at stake,but if you do the right thing in the beginning,thats a good thing and becomes eternal
this is great thing about bitcoin is it forces people to be good
if some alt copies your work thats all they can say is they are copycats,and word gets out about that,which leads to bad reputation
also this works both ways and alts have ideas that can help the whole ecosystem which likely will become absorbed by whatever the people decide is the main coin
but the whole point is the world will become better faster if everything is available to everyone to experiment with

it dont say anywhere they lost the keys,it say they are having trouble locating them 
canadian bank froze their funds almost 1 yr ago,then court case,then the bank gave them their money back(no charges laid or 1 penny missing) but in form of a draft,but now no bank in canada will cash it and its a canadian bank draft...so the money is still frozen
effectively the banks have crushed them
the CEO died in india while building a orphanage,he had crohns disease and died of a result of 'complications' relating to that disease...stress can cause flare ups and be very painful according to google--pain/disease/foreign country

there is an existing global green party already setup that could change the world,and with the environment being a big issue,could be tipping point soon anyways for them to come into power and the green parties have many scientists that could align nicely with the science of bitcoin and crypto
i like the color, green for go

if this is the CEO's account you can read about his complications with the banks and he said they were going to sue the bank for holding all his money hostage for almost a yr and i think the banks wont cash the cheques the courts ordered them to give back to QCX...this has got potential for a movie one day lol

where is the whole video?

jamie and bankers live for today leaving the debt for future unborn generations to pay
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:20:23
its the banks that started this whole problem and they lassood up 100 thousand customers in the process lol
nobody knows why the CEO died...yet

and its not wise to save in fiat,which forces everyone to invest in stocks or whatever which is a gamble because who can understand that stock world which is essentially run by the fiat world of the rich and powerful that are too big to fail and will always get bailouts further reducing buying power of fiat

you say theoreticly,so yes lightning can scale infinite,and theres 2 months left to implement before Q1 is over

there is a huge difference if they use bitcoin,or if they use their own created coin
the bitcoin IDEA and what it stands for is out there,and it extremely hard to beat bitcoin because for 10 yrs no one has been able to come up with anything better
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:33:44
im surprised no one is answering you yet,but i think it uses a fair amount thats why i suggested the satellite,but i seemed to be getting downvoted for that,so maybe thats not the best way to go but i thought i remember reading the sat would help reduce bandwidth consumption...anyways i did find this  seems to have lots of info there
@_date: 2019-01-25 04:54:15
thank you!

i didnt see that,ok ill delete this post then,someone else can figure out how to beat bitcoindotcom top of the leaderboards
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:53:29
teamwork is the best
@_date: 2019-01-25 02:17:43
i dont know much about it,but it seems if you can get the download for free cost should drop lots
hopefully others can clarify, i couldnt find the specs either if you use the satellites but i didnt look to hard

was in not the germans that razed the romans after they fell from hyperinflation?
then lords ruled germany for long time which eventually gave birth to modern banks and the royal family of england?
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:46:20
ouch! sounds like you want to hit someone,but guess what  IS the most official site bitcoin has and you think there a problem with that? you must be a moron lol
anyways we could call each other names all day long,and we could tell people to go in a million different direction to get info about bitcoin resulting in frustration,confusion and anger...google dont care it judges by clicks 
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:19:04
free money is great way to get people to experiment!,good video and thats cool of you to be honest
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:24:36
theres no problem having rich people in the world,but under the new bitcoin rules they will have to be intelligent and worthy enough to hold onto their riches all under the same rules as everyone else in the world
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:32:30
if bitcoin was at say 100,000 and you had just 10 dollars worth of bitcoin,maybe it will be better to just hold those bitcoin in lightning fashion forever because a transaction on the blockchain may be something like 10 or 20 dollars
@_date: 2019-01-30 09:00:33
its a good listen,peter is honest and ancient i think and can see what many of us cant,everything will get stronger after the controversy settles down which is good
@_date: 2019-01-25 04:53:48
thank you!
@_date: 2019-01-25 23:03:02
your choice of  is good i can agree with that for sure,but it looks highly technical to me and i dont see a selection of wallets that are cool towards bitcoin so where does the general public go for those choices? we cant tell them to go in a million different directions from a million different mouths,no man thats too confusing and maybe bitcoin core has other priorities besides keeping track of quality wallets etc,etc which i can imagine is time consuming
other thing id like to say is maybe satoshi wanted the holders of  to be slightly controversial and open source with ability for community to input,that way more angles are covered in all aspects
my whole point of this post is to remove confusion that dumb search engines are promoting,if you got better ideas of how to beat search engines and remove confusion that is out there speak up,but remember it has to be friendly and easy towards noobs
i believe bitcoin does need a main site with wallets,exchanges,history,everything,im not asking for perfection,that would be boring,this site can evolve alongside bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:23:06
i think it means infinite transactions can be done on lightning cheaply before being settled on the blockchain
it cost money or energy to spam the bitcoin blockchain,i would guess eventually transactions on the blockchain will be expensive,but thats ok,should scale to the value of each bitcoin i think,something like that
@_date: 2019-01-22 22:20:59
this is great,i would rather see a merging process rather than a clash
in the future if the banks cant provide a service then people wont need them anymore
but for some time there will be people that need help managing their bitcoin
