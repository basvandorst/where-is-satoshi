About 45 days ago, logged back in this week to get a few mBTC to send to a friend; noticed my account limits had dropped from 1000 weekly to $25.00; emailed support, received back that due to a manual account review, my account was now being destroyed and to get all my funds/BTC out ASAP.

Getting a "User is unable to buy" as well today, however, my account is several years old, fully verified, and, I've purchased and sold thousands of dollars in BTC over the past 2 years?!

Sigh, if steam could only find me a way to start charging me sales tax on my wallet purchases only. I'd have no problem transferring some of my BTC to it then.

Totally agreed, it takes me hours if not days when I want to move gold or USD around and costs me a fuck ton!! Bitcoin is faster, and cheap! /s

I'd like to know that as well, traded there full 1000% confirmed for several years, then one day, your account is shut down, no reason for why and how to change it or reactivate it. Should start calling them Con-Base, at least I was allowed to get my BTC out!

Haven't logged in since last summer, speaking of which I still have a few coins there, probably should go check it back out, thanks!

Agreed, if only it didn't take almost a full week to deposit and purchase BTC!? They ever looking to do instant transfers?

Couldn't the government just kill off port 8333 and 8332 with devastating effects to the bitcoin network, thus, shutting it down?
