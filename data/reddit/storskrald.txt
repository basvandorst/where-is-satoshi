Yes sure. But don’t base your trading on feelings. Only the market is always right
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:54:16
He thinks we’re all easy and stupid. But it actually makes him look extremely manipulative and arrogant. What a douche. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 07:35:49
You got manipulated by Roger Ver. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:39:03
Hold my beer, Roger Ver
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:00:56
Hopefully thats not your privatekey 
@_date: 2018-08-24 18:25:28
You can thank Roger Ver for your loss. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 06:15:02
Bcash and Roger Vers trying to persuade people into believing that Bcash is the real  Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:55:04
Right on brother!
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:54:35
It will happen

In order to have recorded the keystrokes, a program would have to have been installed beforehand, I believe.

You would have installed the keylogger yourself, in order to have access to it.
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:09:34
Sorry for your loss man

Marketing manipulation. He needs to be exposed in this obvious marketing scam 
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:13:05
Hardware or mobile or?

Bought 0.15 btc at 5800
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:53:22
Bcash is definitely doing manipulative marketing. It’s just plain unethical and wrong. 
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:14:21
Buy a hardware Ledger or use an wallet app that doesn’t store information at 3.parties. Check out Trust wallet, Jaxx or enjiin
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:14:39
I like Trust wallet
@_date: 2019-06-05 09:31:38
Might just as well post your private  crypto adress on Reddit

The fifty-fifty chance knowledge or the simple rising wegde knowledge.

Coinbase 
@_date: 2019-06-08 09:05:07
Nonono he’s wrong. I’ve heard bitcoin goes to 1 million. And that’s a fact
@_date: 2019-12-20 21:32:49
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:58:41
I can strongly recommend this new exchange: BEAXY
Since Binance will be shutting down for U.S costumers, Beaxy is a great alternative. 
I will highly recommend buying their native exchange coin ‘BXY’. Its destined to rise.

Search: institutions secretly buying bitcoin in mass via otc
@_date: 2018-11-01 06:36:34
It will go through. Check YouTube. Someone has bought 115.000 BTC OTC for the 4 last weeks. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:20:18

Got a TA to that floor? ��
I got bruises and scratches but i aint bleeding yet!
@_date: 2018-11-02 09:12:01
It will go through. They already bought huge amounts of BTC otc the last 3-4 weeks. Big money are aiming to take control and take your money. 
Remember BTC was made to give control to the people!!
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:17:32
It will be a slow bleed. And we haven’t seen panic yet 
@_date: 2018-07-04 15:45:46

Still waiting for $5800 ����
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:13:59
I agree. Marts have been a exiting months. There’s been quite some buy opportunities but it haven’t felt right yet. 
I believer will experience a full marketcycle. So from now on it’s a slow decent for a another month or two, and then a very very fast rise. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:10:03
It is so obvious how Roger Ver tries to manipulate the world into thinking that Bcash is the original Bitcoin. I think it’s terrible and people need to wake up. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:49:40
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:52:11
If you HAVE to name that manipulative coin, call it BCash. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 08:34:46
Deserved 
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:47:35
Would any advisor, advice any institution or big investor to buy at $8-9k? It’s not logical to me. 
The Marketcycle isn’t halfdone yet and whales are controlling the market. 
I’d say it has to go sub 7k again and confirm bottom. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:15:04
Wait for it. $5800 is coming 
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:37:49
We’re all neutral??
Thanks Obama
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:40:50
Come on..
If you want to buy BTC, Coinbase is reliable. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 21:09:03
5800 is coming
@_date: 2019-05-15 08:50:30
It’s just a gap that’s all
