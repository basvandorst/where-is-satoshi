Coinbase does sketchy shit all the time, you are lucky if you are one of the users that's avoided their spotty service. 
There are many other choices. Kraken, Gemini, Localbitcoins, local ATMs. If Coinbase is screwing you over, choose another option. Vote with your dollars. I been using Coinbase since literally the day their exchange opened and never not once had a problem doing any business with them.

Communication has changed little in the time its methods evolved a hundredfold. You're right, there is less exchange of ideas and more defense of already held positions. However, when one side resorts to underhanded tactics, aka dishonest communication/deception, there is no communication. In my earlier post, I said I believe this is the most moderate forum for Bitcoin discussion on Reddit- the only other subreddit similar in size to this one is but as its been noted many times, is a total echo chamber. Yes, BTU discussions on are ridiculed and their posters humiliated. I think this is because most of us that frequent this sub view BTU as an absurd concept, something that can not be seriously considered as a path for Bitcoin, and every person that has come to discuss BTU here display such a gap in their understanding of Bitcoin that i can no longer take BTU or its advocates seriously.

I think it's illogical to think that Bitcoin will continue its present course to the point it becomes unusable. Too many people, miners and otherwise, are too invested in it to allow that to happen. If no one uses Bitcoin, miners don't get paid, and miners are the ones slowing it down. It's a tug of war, and the right side will win, it always does in a trustless and decentralized system. The key is to keep Bitcoin trustless and decentralized. 
Just keep using Bitcoin. Your use of it adds more traffic to the network, the longer and higher the strain is, the faster this bowel will have a movement.

Segwit is only controversial amongst those who would lose personal profit upon segwit's activation. I have yet to see 1 single truly good point on why segwit should not be activated. 
Hesitating to support Segwit because it's controversial make no sense to me. I realize that many people are in this for personal profit, that's ok, but I also realize that they will do whatever they can in order to boost personal profit, which in turn holds Bitcoin back.
Those who want Bitcoin to succeed for its own sake, for what it can offer the world, support segwit. 
If a better option than segwit comes across, then I will support it. 
At the present moment, segwit is the only sane option, in my eyes. 
Doing nothing is no better than supporting BU, in my eyes.

Regardless, being Bitcoin, there are ways to move your money without being snooped on by banks or govs. Simply use a handful of intermediary wallets between the point of origin and your final destination (e.g. The casino).

There's a civil war between two camps. One wants to centralize mining and the other wants to make small but important changes to the way transactions work. Yesterday the news broke that Bitmain, one of those working towards centralization, may have been leveraging an certain technique that allows their miners to be much more efficient than those not using this technique. This is of course antithetical to the purpose of Bitcoin- essentially, it's been momentarily, partially hijacked, but we're out of parachutes and not everyone is gonna make it to the moon so figuratively speaking, a lot of people are about to get thrown out the window.

Let us remember that the SEC denied the ETF a few weeks ago, quoting a "lack of regulation".
So if you were cheering on the ETF, block chain legislation is up the same alley, as this will no doubt fulfill the SEC's wish for more regulation. 
I don't see this as negative- the proverbial back doors to Bitcoin can't be crushed, save by Bitcoin's permanent extinction itself- so you ban local bitcoins.com in your country, a dozen replacements will appear. Look what happened with that dark net market once it went down- a handful almost instantly replaced it. 
Time and time again, the lesson presents itself- no one can stop the natural flow of events, and in this case, it's Bitcoin's rise and hopefully the demise of the bank-government symbiosis. Alcohol was criminalized, people fought it and won. Cannabis was criminalized, people began to fight it and now the most forward thinking nations are de-criminalizing it. Seems we're all waking up, around the world.

Bitcoin Unlimited was a failure from the moment it was coded poorly. The software is full of bugs, 2 of which have been discovered so far. BU was probably never even intended as a serious consideration, rather as a stall for time to delay Segwit from being activated, which allowed some people to make a large personal profit. 
Segwit is the real logical choice, in my personal opinion. Look up the facts online yourself, avoiding Reddit as an information source. You don't need convincing if you read about Segwit yourself and try to see whether BU or Segwit (the 2 biggest choices) is the logical choice for Bitcoin to proceed with

Avoid Blockchain.info, their metrics are notoriously unreliable. Furthermore, keeping your coins in any exchange/web wallet is inherently unsafe, because doing so means you are not in full control of your wallet keys. Avoiding web wallets means you also cut out the possibility of being phished. There simply is no benefit to using a web wallet, none of them (as far as I know) have anything to offer that should make you consider using a web wallet VS a hardware or mobile wallet.
Use a hardware wallet, like Trezor, for the best security possible right now.
Phone-based hardware wallets, that involve the phone's encryption itself, are a close second. I personally like Breadwallet the most. Airbitz, Arcbit and Mycelium are all excellent mobile wallets also. Generally, iOS seems to be more secure for Bitcoin purposes, considering the walled-off aspect of the operating system, as opposed to Android's. Someone please correct me if this is no longer true.
Mining via home PC is not feasible anymore, it hasn't been profitable for a few years now, since the rise of industrialized mining. Your home PC simply can not compete with literal warehouses stacked floor to ceiling with miners.
Any half-decent wallet necessarily will feature an adjustable fee. Basically, the faster you want your transaction to go through, the higher fee you pay. This may change very soon, in what form the change will take place, it's not easy to say. Bitcoin is always changing and mutating, every day.
By "melting units", I am going to guess that simply means sending one large transaction, as opposed to breaking it up into many little ones- you would be charged a separate fee for each transaction, which may or may not end up being more than you would have  paid for a single transaction.
As a side note, I recommend using localbitcoins.com to source all your Bitcoin.

You are doing a disservice to OP by not mentioning that Coinbase's support is virtually nonexistent.
If you should happen to encounter a problem using Coinbase, basically you can't rely on their support to help you out. As they haven't made a comment on the situation, we are left to hypothesize- it seems Coinbase is severely understaffed, leading to a backlog of support tickets and/or/sometimes withdrawls, meaning your money could be inexplicably tied up for an unknown time, or even worse, simply vanish.
Personally, I've used Coinbase since 2013 without a single issue. However, many many people post their Coinbase horror stories here on Reddit. My point is, if you use Coinbase, **proceed with caution.**
Coinbase also requires stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. This means you necessarily have to verify your identity in order to use Coinbase. If this bothers you, there are other ways to get Bitcoin- localbitcoins.com is my personal current favorite.

Despite all the horror stories over the years about Coinbase, I've never had a single problem with them. Coinbase verified my identity the same day I submitted the verification documents. It's been 4 weeks and Gemini can't even explain to me what the problem is.

What I'm arguing against is the people who seem to try to make it a state of emergency, like Bitcoin is on the verge of failing- that's the vibe I get reading this sub, it's apocalyptic. Reading this sub as someone new to Bitcoin would totally turn me off this new currency. *"Why the fuck would anyone willingly use a currency with so many problems?"* the answer is, the problems are not nearly as vast and all-consuming as Reddit makes it out to be.
Sure, the network is slower than it was in 2010, but you seriously want to slow down new user adoption? The fuck? How is decreasing the amount of new users going to motivate existing users to move forward with Segwit when the built-up pressure already is not enough to push us through?
Why don't we run a poll and see exactly how many people here literally want to stop Bitcoin adoption, because the network "can't handle any more traffic". It's just bullshit in my eyes. 
It's the same thing with all the people posting in CB has millions of users, and not one of the satisfied users is going to make a post about how great their experience with CB was, only those with problems will make a post. That is a bias in itself.

My general experience in dealing with humans has taught me that if someone has a secret advantage over their competitors, you can safely assume *they will certainly use it*. Miners are in this for profit- it's antithetical to their purpose to *not* use their advantage. 
Of course Bitmain will deny it. Confession is the final step towards moving the right way.

Can you explain more?
To me it sounds like you're projecting your own perceptions of the public view of Bitcoin onto Bitcoin, as it were fact. How did you come to know "most people think bitcoin = evil"?
Of the maybe 40+ people I have introduced Bitcoin to, not one of them brought up the fact that Bitcoin can be used for many illegal things- no different than cash.
Anyone that avoids Bitcoin based on the media telling them an ugly story, well, there are late adopters to everything. I'm sure plenty of people talked shit when Bell invented the telephone, it disrupted the entire communication industry, people couldn't see how they were going to move forward. Same with Bitcoin. No revolution is painless or easy, especially when it concerns changes as vast as Bitcoin can make.

The bank cartel will increase its fight against the increasing adoption of Bitcoin. If this means shutting down every Bitcoin user's PayPal account, no problem, no one here wants money to take 5 days to change anyways. 
If my PayPal account is shut down, I will suffer exactly 0 losses.... **Because everything I ever used PayPal for I can replace with Bitcoin.**
Hopefully Bitcoin results in PayPal shutting doors completely- or even better, reforming as a mining pool.

Coinbase withdrew 2 separate "international service fees" from my bank without my authorization. I do not know what these charges are, or what they are for. I was not notified of them. This is the first time I've seen this happen since I started using CB in 2013. Take note.

specifically says we can't handle more users, without further additions/improvements to Bitcoin. 
To me, that makes it sound like Bitcoin is in a state of emergency- like it literally can't operate any more today. 
The aim of my post was to offer a counter-view, that NO, Bitcoin is still usable, still reasonably fast, still doing what it's supposed to. 
Yes, lightning and Segwit need to happen. 
No, we don't need to slow down user adoption. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 18:24:47
Sure, you're right, if you want to argue semantics. That doesn't negate what I said. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin is exactly what has been missing in the existing, wholly-centralized system.

I absolutely have to point out that **not** "every single point of entry into Bitcoin requires showing ID."
Localbitcoins.com offers cash trades/deposits for Bitcoin. Bitcoin ATMs, while charging a premium for their service, also don't require an ID. There is also Bitsquare, a purely peer2peer trading network. Of course you can privately trade anytime with anyone, just use escrow. 
I think the more Bitcoin is accepted, the more ramps on to it will purposefully avoid requiring ID. The more momentum this gets, the harder it's going to be for the bank goons to try to stop the bleeding of fiat currencies into Bitcoin

Every transaction I made in the last week (30+ txs) had a minimum of 3 confirmations within 20 minutes. Frankly I'm sick and tired of people talking like Bitcoin is on the verge of collapsing. 
Yes, we need Segwit. No, the blockchain is not about to explode.

Clearly written by someone with a hard on for banks and financial self abuse, and that has never personally used Bitcoin. Unethical, dangerous? A person that uses these words to describe a financial currency has no understanding of logic or is simply preaching bank cartel propaganda, in that it's "unethical and dangerous" because it corrodes and destroys false and abusive financial systems, those installed and ran by the banks, particularly the involvement of the private banking sector in federal government.

We need an Uber, but payments in Bitcoin only, and requires a break between your real life identity and your wallet address.

You need to raise a big stink about it or you won't get a human response. If you have money tied up on Coinbase, you might consider threatening legal action just to get them moving. I see no qualms in doing this with a business that consistently fails to provide any actually useful customer support. 
Coinbase seems to lack the manpower to handle the amount of people using their site.

What do you want to use Blockchain.info for? As a wallet, it's inherently insecure as its web-based, as opposed to hardware-based, like Trezor. As a block explorer, they've been known to either fudge numbers, or simply report inaccurate numbers.

No hard fork/attack will happen. People will eventually remember BU as an ugly stickynote on Bitcoin's ass, sweaty from the ride to the moon and beyond. 
Realistically, no one knows exactly why the price is fluctuating. It always is. Perhaps now more people have confidence in BU failing, so they're not afraid to invest further in Bitcoin.

Nakamoto come back to this planet swinging his saber, segregating all witnesses of his perfection into two camps, those of light and those who have yet to see the light.

And when they were come to the place which is called there they crucified him, the malefactors on one side, and the believers on the other. Then said Nakamoto- Segwitians, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his Bitcoin, and signaled Segwit support.

Thankfully they don't represent the Bitcoin community as a whole. I like Reddit a lot because of the instant interaction and communication, as opposed to other forums. But the communities here are like Donald trump- loud, obnoxious, stubborn. Maybe if we all grow up a couple more years...

It WILL eventually drop. Then it WILL eventually rise. Rinse and repeat. Just hodl the coins if you decide to buy. No one in the world can accurately predict what the Bitcoin price is about to do. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:30:03
Frankly, it's amazing to me that this single piece of advice (transfer coins to a wallet only you control) is *still* necessary to repeat. 
To me, this shows that new Bitcoin users either don't understand the security risk in keeping coins on an exchange, or simply don't care. I don't know which one is worse- ignorance or willful apathy. But is there anything to do, beyond simply repeating the same thing, year after year?
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:37:12
I'm hodling my coins indefinitely. Not cashing out in the foreseeable future. I believe Bitcoin holds much more promise than simply a way to get rich in fiat. 
If Bitcoin goes down to $1000 tomorrow, I won't be worried whatsoever, because i think it will eventually recover- as it always has in the past. 
Basically it comes down to whether or not you believe in the power of decentralized vs centralized currency.
