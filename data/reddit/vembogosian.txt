Seriously though, it's in the works. ;o)

It depends on the rest of the parameters of the trade (such as how much collateral you or your counterparty commits). Right now the UltraCoin app is fairly symmetrical (both parties to a trade commit the same amount of principal and collateral and maintain the same leverage).
Let's say you think [AAPL]( is going to gain more or lose less than [GOOG]( so you want to receive AAPL and pay GOOG. I believe the opposite so I want to receive GOOG and pay AAPL. You and I enter into a simple swap with a principal amount of 0.05BTC ([in the neighborhood of US$11 as of right now]( a collateral amount of 100% of the principal (so another 0.05 BTC/US$11), and a leverage amount of 100×.
The most either one of us can gain or lose in this case is 0.1 BTC (our principal of 0.05 BTC plus our collateral of 0.05 BTC). The question is how fast things move. Our levered volatility would be equivalent to our principal times the leverage (or 5 BTC). In other words, a %2 cumulative gain or loss wipes one person out and unwinds the swap in favor of the other person.
Think of the principal plus collateral as *roughly* analogous to hard stop loss or take-profit limit. Since both our sides are fully funded (via a multisig transaction), there's no risk of the loser welching and the winner not getting the funds (i.e., it's not like FXCM where existing stop losses were passed, but effectively ignored because there were no bids).

Regarding pricing discovery, that's a pretty astute observation. As you probably recognize, derivatives have value independent of their underlying assets. Right now, it's difficult to tell how much that is with our swaps, much less capture it using the current UltraCoin app. I'm reluctant to say much more, other than finding a way to allow people to expose and capture that value is very much on our radar.

Yours is an excellent point. Even the name "swap" carries with it legacy baggage. One of the most universal problems that accompanies making something new is how to talk about it. We often construct metaphors from things we already have names for, which work...until they don't (i.e., until the abstraction is no longer consistent with the reality of the new thing). This can be jarring. When a misunderstanding results in an unexpected loss of value, that's especially unpleasant.
UltraCoin swaps have a lot of "knobs" (another metaphor) that we've struggled to label in ways that are accurate, but don't take hours to explain, especially to those who have heard of Bitcoin, but aren't intimately familiar with the blockchain.
Clearly, this is an ongoing effort. :o)

Within the UltraCoin app, there are no fractional reserves. All trades are fully funded with BTC. Think of "leverage" in this context as a volatility multiplier, but each party's losses are limited to the amount allocated to the trade (and hence each counterparty's wins are similarly limited).
That doesn't mean that people can't borrow based on fractional reserves off network, but nothing prevents doing that with any asset. While [it is a subject of some controversy]( Bitcoin is not unique in that sense.

I think you're right to guess that there might be some complexities with finding counterparties for these types of trades (market makers maybe), but they are interesting, and something we're looking into. I am reluctant to share too many details, but based on the questions you're asking, you can probably guess at a few of them (and come up with several we haven't thought of).
Hedging is actually one of the primary uses for the UltraCoin app. Assuming we achieve do our job and increase market liquidity, even today the functionality exists for unsophisticated parties to periodically allocate some portion of their bitcoins to mid-term swaps in favor of a fiat currency.
In following your example, let's consider a US retail merchant who decides to accept bitcoins for her goods or services. She could, at the end of every week, take 50% of the bitcoins she received that week, put them in her UltraCoin wallet, and commit them to one or more six month swaps where she receives US dollars in terms of BTC ([USDBTC=X]( or pays BTC in terms of US dollars ([BTCUSD=X]( As a sort of "hack" if one only wants exposure to one asset rather than two, one can use US dollars valued in US dollars ([USDUSD=X]( which is always 1.000) as a constant for the other asset.
After several months, she would have rolling swaps insulating her from some of her exposure to Bitcoin volatility. For any given swap, if bitcoins go up in terms of US dollars, she takes a notional loss on her bitcoins. If they go down, she makes a notional gain. Either way, the portion of her wallet committed to those swaps doesn't lose value in terms of US dollars (minus the swap fees).
She could do the same for (paper) gold:
Receive: [GLD]( (ETF valued in terms of USD)
Pay: BTCUSD=X (BTC in terms of USD)
Or she could put some portion in GLD/BTCUSD=X swaps and some portion in USDBTC=X/USDUSD=X swaps, etc.
There are some very interesting trades out there. This isn't investment advice of course, but let's say you saw [this]( and wanted to bet on rising oil prices or falling energy stock values. You could receive [\^SPGSCI]( and pay [\^GSPE]( or [\^NYE]( Either way, you'd likely be in the money for those trades if you entered sometime around the beginning of February (see [here]( and [here]( although sometimes Yahoo's charting interface can be a bit flaky).
With leverage, it gets even more interesting. Let's say you had 1 BTC you wanted to invest, and wanted to engage in the oil/energy trade above, but also wanted to be insulated from BTC/USD volatility. You could place the following trades:
Trade 1:
* Principal 0.5 BTC
* Receive \^SPGSCI
* Pay \^NYE
* Leverage 2x
Trade 2:\*
* Principal 0.5 BTC
* Receive USDBTC=X
* Pay USDUSD=x
* Leverage 2x


These are just some of the ways the UltraCoin app can be used to tackle hedging or arbitrage situations right now. Though we understand it's a bit manual and error prone in the hands of a beginner. We're working on enabling or making much simpler these and many other scenarios. This is really just the beginning for us.

In regards to regulatory intervention, I can tell you that my track record for predicting the future is pretty bad. We're still in the very early stages of adoption of blockchain-based technologies. That being said, regulatory bodies appear to be paying much more attention to Bitcoin now than I remember them paying to the internet in, say, 1996. There's always a risk that existing industries disrupted by new technology will lobby the "men with guns" to intercede to protect their interests. Look what's happening to Uber and Airbnb. But we try to keep tabs on where things look like they're going and adapt as best we can. How anyone does that effectively is probably another topic altogether.

One way to emulate this today is to scale down the principal, but ramp up the collateral in proportion. Something like:
*p'* = *p* x *s*
*c'* = (1/*s* - 1) x (*c* + 1)
*s* is the "softened" leverage; 0 &lt; *s* &lt; 1
*p* is the original principal
*c* is the original collateral
*p'* is the "softened" principal
*c'* is the "softened" collateral
(At least I *think* that's right, but it's late, and I haven't double checked my work. This is all the more reason to adopt your suggestion, so users don't have to risk screwing up the math like I probably just did.)
For example, to emulate 0.1x leverage for a trade with 1 BTC as principal and no collateral, one could place a trade with 0.1 BTC and 900% collateral. Either way, 1 BTC will be committed to the trade, but profit and loss for the second will be in proportion to the principal of 0.1 BTC rather than 1 BTC for the first.
In fact, there are a number of ways to set up equivalent trades that may not be matched with each other. (Which I'm not sure is a bug or a feature. I'll have to think on that.)
Fundamentally, what's the different between: a 1 BTC trade with no collateral or leverage; and a 0.1 BTC trade with 900% collateral and 10x leverage?

With respect to ongoing development, UltraCoin is in beta. We have tons of ideas for features and applications that we're constantly working to develop and push out. The recent addition of leverage is one of those. (And of course bug fixing, etc.) I don't know that this will ever be "finished".
By the way, if you know any really good developers, please send them my way. ;o)

Although to be fair, try replicating the above oil/energy trade using a traditional means, and you're already looking at requiring intermediate-to-advanced knowledge. First, you'd have to examine various ETFs or other traded instruments you believed approximated either the indexes or your desired slice of the market. If you're shorting stocks or funds, you probably need access to margin.\* Alternately, you could start trading options, but if your strategy involves selling them, you may still have a margin requirement, or require committing your capital to holding underlying shares. Plus, you'll have to do some math to figure out relative share volumes or lot sizes, account for decays in the values of the derivatives, etc. Then, when all is said and done, you hope that no market makes such a violent move that your stop losses are ignored because the bid or ask has just gone away like it did to FXCM on EUR/CHF trades. It's rare, but it does happen.
