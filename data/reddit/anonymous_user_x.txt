You don't have to be online to monitor it. At least not 24/7 365. If the person that you're connected to tries to close the Channel with an illegitimate transaction you will have plenty of time 2 show the correct transaction history and force a penalty closing transaction.

Neither of the comments have any emotional language.  Not on topic to reject an argument citing "emotion" and then simply state a claim with no evidence.
If he is invested in ETH and divested from Bitcoin it is in his direct interest to see Bitcoin fail.

That explanation can be valid as long as the price of the block reward is lower than the cost to produce a block. And this will encourage a constant increase in hashing power and may keep us at greater than 6 blocks per hour average until or near the next having
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:40:41
He has been attacking it for years well before we were making out the 1mb cap through his support of other implementations.
He is attacking it because it is forcing him to clean up the mess he has made of his UTXO set and not allowing him to externalize his costs onto the network.
He is attacking it, not because of delays but because he has personally divested of it and it is in his best interest to see it fail and his other coins succeed.

How do you think the US enforces the sanctions? It's through the banking system and access to the dollar. With Bitcoin Iran doesn't need access to the banking system and therefore the US has no preventative enforcement power. This will most certainly encourage Iran to adopt it. If only to a small black market degree as opposed to National policy.
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:34:50
How do you think Iran sold all of its oil when sanctions were on? The US dollar. Put in at least five minutes of research so that you can discover they were still making hundreds of millions of dollars a year yes dollars per year while sanctions were on.

If this idea works, it would be equivalent to the TPS potential of 14MB (roughly?) Blocks in the main chain.  Would that chill everyone out?

First I would tell you that ICANN cannot shut down Bitcoin nodes and defeat your whole argument.  Second I would tell you that if someone spends $ to have a node hosted and said node is shut down and $ wasted, they will be unlikely to do it again and therefore unlikely to continue contributing to the network
Edit: I just re-read your post and I have to say that I'm flabbergasted. Why would anybody who believes in Bitcoin and it's decentralisation also believe that there's an organization that can shut off all nodes with the flip of a switch. Queens value proposition would be zero and posting anything on Amazon web services would be a waste of money

Eventually there will be no block reward to subsidize transaction fees and pay for security of the network.  Should we just wait until then and flip to a few market over night?  I think not, the shock would be epic.  It is healthy and important for the fee market to develop and to grow.

People soliciting for donations to run temporary nodes of a certain flavour of bitcoin is definitely evidence of this and is easily find-able.
The only nodes that should really be evaluated are nodes that are intended to run for a long period of time to support the network.  Not those nodes intended to run for a short period of time to try and sway public support to a particular flavour.  THESE nodes will not exist in a few weeks/months/years and are irrelevant for determining the true state of the network.
Essentially they are short term static.

@_date: 2017-08-29 16:16:34
This is not true. The spammers are the miners so they recoup most of their fees. The more centralized it becomes the more of their fees they recoup. They can actually increase the amount of money they make using this method by driving the standard fee or higher. Google around for it and you'll find that somebody did the math

If I were supporting an agenda whose 3 most prominent spokesman was these bufoons than I would absolutely begin a period of introspection.

No. Inflation is not good. Tell me why you think it's good. Because it's not.
We had two world wars that were financed with government printed money, inflation. Before that we were on the gold standard almost globally and wars were much smaller and when somebody ran out of gold the war ended or when somebody realize that they would run out of gold before they won the war ended. Now we have governments permanently taxing secretly through inflation and convincing them that it's good for them. Reducing the value of their citizens labor and pocketing it and using it to their own political interest.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.

This post was automatically moded.
Has nothing to do with an altcoin or an individual.  They are not even mentioned.  It is about network security and scalability. 
It currently appears to have drawn two shills since I messaged the mods but I have had no response and I'm not sure if they just linked in or if it's visable again.
That GBTC post was relevant IMO and if mods didn't think so maybe they could respond to a message instead of just letting auto mod + silence be the SOP.

Old article that I think we've all seen. I don't think it applies because institutional money hasn't been able to wet their beak yet. If they haven't been able to buy yet we can't have a sell signal yet. 
The interesting thing about Bitcoin and it being a new asset class is that institutional money is being forced to be last to the table.

@_date: 2017-11-13 17:51:32
The problem is that nobody would be making them if there wasn't a market to supply them to. Therefore you have to punish the market. decriminalizing possession of the pictures would give incentive to the creation of more CP.
I agree like I said with reducing the prosecution of edge cases but that is not accomplished through incentivizing more CP being created.
Anyone can recognize the relationship between the markets existence and its influence on the creation of CP. There for anyone who allows such a market to exist is ipso facto condoning the creation of more CP.

I'm sorry but you are wrong.  Try this thought experiment.  Suppose I own two companies, one makes product A the other makes product B.  Product A makes me 99% of my money and product B makes me 1% of my money.  Along comes (what I view) a threat to my products A and B.  What is my best option?  Spend revenue constantly defending my investments in A and B or sacrificing B to no longer have to defend against the threat to A.  The only logical option is to let B go down in flames.  
Instead, bitmain is spending much more time/effort/money defending B then they should.  Even destroying their reputation with B by using the product that they already sold to their customer and delaying shipping.  To defend B?  NO, that makes no sense at all.  They are doing it because success in B proves that there would be a success in A AND THAT works against their agenda in A.

I have never seen any evidence that a hard fork was agreed to.  I have seen a letter immediately after stating a soft fork was agreed to.  Additionally, how the fuck does anyone think hat they can make an enforceable agreement with a couple of developers in an open source community where nobody has authority over anyone else?
Literally none of this makes sense

Asics boost is parented which makes it a monopoly.  Others can't use and therefore can't compete which forces centralization

I have seen the email from nullc after the meeting.  It clearly said soft fork.  Jihan and others broke the agreement anyway by supporting other implementations.  Furthermore, I give no fucks for either of these things because nullc isn't a dictator.  Core isn't a company and nobody has the authority to speak for independent volunteers.

The security issue which you bring up is of primary importance, which you clearly understand and which Roger apparently does not.  
The block propagation being slowed between miners due to increased nodes is actually  100% false.  Miners do not communicate between each other using nodes!  They have a separate relay network ;)

@_date: 2017-04-12 02:02:35
So he says 15% which assumes an electric bill of only $13 million annually.  2 mil savings on 13 mil is a big deal.  I don't get his conclusion that it doesn't matter.  Also, I wonder why he doesn't address putting it on the chip if it isn't intended to be used.
Edit: also, I'm on mobile and 13 mil seems low.  Somebody check the math? Since he is converting between petahash and gigahash shouldn't he be multiplying by 1 million at the end? And not 1000....?
@_date: 2017-04-19 23:05:47
I suggest you reread that document.  It says clearly that segwit is being developed as a soft Fork. It also says that the core contributors undersigned will propose a hard Fork to the other core volunteers three months after the release of segwit.  It also says that no hard Fork will take place without broad Community Support. Segwit isn't even on the main net yet so I would say the three-month clock hasn't even started. Furthermore I don't think the three-month clock should ever start seeing is that a long time ago the miners broke with their part of the Hong Kong agreement by supporting other platforms. Not to mention there is very clearly not broad community support for a hard Fork
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:19:37
While I agree that him saying it  to the hardcore will accomplish absolutely nothing, I still think that for those who are new to the topics, having a detailed response to FUD (that they will encounter quickly) can potentially stop them from turning into hardcore If we can't convert the lost, let's at least try and stop them from converting others with lies

Choosing segwit does not mean no further block size increases on chain.  That is complete FUD.  And by the way, being against something that you don't have to use because you want to force someone else to do something that they will have to use is complete bullshit.  You don't have to use segwit even if it's implemented but I do have to deal with a block size increase even if I don't want it and to be very clear, I don't yet want it.

You explained the price rise on one exchange only.  An exchange where volume is dropping.  This does not explain the price rise of the market which is, recently, driven by news of ETF decision being revisited by a new SEC chair and any revelation that is bad for bitmain/BU gives confidence to the market that the network is antifragile.

We have to assume that Jihan is smart. If he's smart he wasn't using Asic boost to grab 30% more blocks.  He would use it to grab as many blocks as he would normally be able to get but lower his energy consumption by 30%.  
This would be the safest method, if he's caught (like he is now) he never loses hashrate and it looks like he did nothing wrong.  If there is a chain split he can crank up by % 30 and attack the other chain with unexpected hashrate.
If he is acting like this, I don't expect to see much change except to his profitability.
@_date: 2017-04-15 18:41:04

Averages are very misleading. I've seen some people are paying 1400 sat/b in the same block as people paying 5 sat/b. That really skewed the average. I paid 0.02$ for a transaction before I went to bed yesterday and woke up with 42 confirmations

@_date: 2017-09-20 18:26:53
No, it has more value to them to continue to use covert asic boost and therefore foregoe transactions.  Of course, every once in a while they need to mine an empty block with a witness commit to smoke screen their covert asic boost but to be clear they derive NO ADDED VALUE from mining empty blocks and foregoing transaction fees UNLESS they have motives to either a) harm the network or b) continue to use the covert asicboost exploit.
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:01:18
To be clear the NYA is bullshit but the fact that the signers that are trying to force it upon us are also breaking it at the same time is absolutely insane.

@_date: 2017-09-07 16:17:14
Over paying by 120x is not explained by Nash equilibrium.  It is explained by bad algorithms that don't recognize the mempool is empty and a fee of 70 sat/b gets you in the next block just as effectively as 200000 sat/b
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:44:24
well, they can't choose which blocks they mine per say but the can choose if they mine blocks that have transactions are not.  This becomes more and more true the further away from the most recent block you become
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:30:06
You are wrong.
What you say is only true when a block is recently mined.  A matter of seconds to a minute.
NOT 15 minutes after the most recent block, especially when you found the most recent block, which is this case and a problem with Antpool in general.

@_date: 2017-09-20 18:51:40
My problem is that bad actors create a narrative that we need more scaling in order for them to centralize control of the network and then, in order to support their narrative of bull shit, they take actions like mining empty blocks or spamming the mempool and then claim that the transaction backlog is evidence that they are correct.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:29:30
The ONLY thing that can keep Bitcoin from failing is the conviction and commitment of the HODLers.  Commitment to placing decentralization above all else and educating new Bitcoiners on its vitality and strength of conviction that will allow us to DUMP fork coins to acquire more BTC.  
If you want to help the network, run and use a node and educate your friends.  If you want to strengthen an defend the network dump your fork coin and HODL strong.

Nobody is orphaning their block after 15 minutes.  Your logic is bullshit.  Here's why.  They could have JUST AS EASILY mined a full block as an empty block UNLESS they had ulterior motives.  It would not have cost them 1 second if their time or increased their odds of being orphaned

No, this is showing where the real value of the economy is derived, in using technology to connect people.  Each of these companies used tech to link people together and squeeze out the middle man.  Items/services get cheaper and providers of items/services get more value meanwhile the companies that used the new technology are destroying the legacy companies providing those items/services.

I read that before posting but I'm not entirely sure it matters.  Equifax recently stated in a TOS that you gave up your right to sue if you used their service.  Guess what, invalid.  I've also seen clauses in contracts that force a party to give up the right to sue "EVEN IN THE CASE OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE" and guess what, unenforceable.
There is a reason why Coinbase backtracked on this once already and is having to give everyone the bcash  connected to their account.  I'll let you do the math.

Airbnb:  cuts out middlemen hotel operators and give power to homeowners and renters to earn extra income.  win/win for everyone except hotel operators
Alibaba:  using tech to connect manufacturers directly to consumers cutting out middlemen.  causes lower prices for buyers and higher returns for producers.  win/win for everyone except the rent-seeking middlemen.
Facebook:  Digital platform consolidating a billion different personal blogs.  personally, i hate facebook but I don't see how they are pushing anything negative on anybody and in exchange for providing a free service they make ad revenue.
Uber:  Allows people to bypass the need to pay $1 million for a taxi medallion and make supplemental income with their personal vehicle, lowers prices for consumers.  win/win
Bitcoin:  gives personal financial sovereignty to the user and fucks the banks in the ass.  win for every human being in existence.

I was unclear. I wasn't stating that trade law applies. I was stating that trade law would allow Bitmain to become subject to a US jurisdictional proceeding.  Though this of course requires US filings and damages which is an assumption of future events (and maybe not likely given the participants)

Not to be a dick but let's take these 1 by 1 because I think you are looking at it in all the wrong ways.
Airbnb:  cuts out middlemen hotel operators and give power to homeowners and renters to earn extra income.  win/win for everyone except hotel operators
Alibaba:  using tech to connect manufacturers directly to consumers cutting out middlemen.  causes lower prices for buyers and higher returns for producers.  win/win for everyone except the rent-seeking middlemen.
Facebook:  Digital platform consolidating a billion different personal blogs.  personally, i hate facebook but I don't see how they are pushing anything negative on anybody and in exchange for providing a free service they make ad revenue.
Uber:  Allows people to bypass the need to pay $1 million for a taxi medallion and make supplemental income with their personal vehicle, lowers prices for consumers.  win/win
Bitcoin:  gives personal financial sovereignty to the user and fucks the banks in the ass.  win for every human being in existence.

Jihan (antpool) is intentionally mining empty blocks while there is a backlog in the mem pool.  It's a dick move.  On one hand, he claims we need bigger blocks and then at the same time he goes and mines empty blocks to try and create the problem that he is complaining about.

If I have 30k in crypto and 15k in fiat debt I'm not on margin.  Why am I not on margin?  Because if the crypto goes down to 15k in value my fiat debt doesn't automatically take away my crypto to cover my debt.  
Now let's use leverage.  I buy 30k of crypto with 15k.  If the value of crypto goes down to 15k, I WILL LOSE EVERYTHING ON MARGIN CALL.

Rodger has said without qualification that segwit is not Bitcoin. That was his rationale for starting b cash.

Three things you're missing.  First they said they weren't going to support bkash.  they ended up having to give everyone bkash even with their pre announcement and terms of service. 
Second you are assuming that these terms of service are enforceable.  they may not be and that may be why they had to give out bcash last time.
 Third you're also assuming that I'm implying that coinbase will lose the lawsuit. I never said that they would lose I said that they would face one and incur legal fees.  Many lawsuits are brought on without the chance of victory in court but the hopes of causing legal fees to potentially be high enough to force a settlement out of court.
Not to be a dick but the chances of them not facing a lawsuit if they follow the 2x Fork are basically zero.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:47:27

"The simple fact is if people didn't run those [full] nodes, this whole discussion [S2X or Bitcoin] would not exist."

I would now like to use my voice to loudly proclaim the following:
Fuck you.  I am not your bitch.  I don't work for you and I don't work for the miners.  The miners work for ME.  I pay their bills.  You work for me.  I pay your bills.

Credit card companies and banks are very good at making you believe that you are not paying fees when in fact you are.  Every CC transaction costs about 3% and you pay it by the retailer raising all their prices by the same amount.  I'm not going to get into all of the varying and nefarious ways banks charge fees but unless you are wealthy, you are paying for bank service and either way you will need to pay fees (usually) to wire out.  Additionally, if you plan your transactions when the network has no backlog you can do just about everything for a penny.

I can tell that you have never worked in or around government.  They can not build an Asics farm without being noticed.  Everything they do is surveilled and to be entirely honest they are far too beuracratic and corrupt to accomplish 10% of what you think they are capable of.
If I was wrong and you were right then they would have already done it and we wouldn't be having this conversation.  The simple fact is beurocrats don't play the long game, they play the short game and Bitcoin is a long play attack.  By the time most governments wake up to the threat it will far to late for them to do anything.

I don't know what any of those words mean

To me, that is what lightning network is all about.  I'm already running a node, I should also stake a hub.

Also they could use overt Asic boost to do this which wouldn't surprise me in the least

You could still run your own node but you wouldn't be able to let other people connect to it

Lol, ETHs second bailout

Regular home internet.  New data cap that I am JUST now being told was put on my account.

I bought the dip. Who bought with me?

House is too far away, get like half a bar on their wifi

Let's be honest, you should do it anyway. ;)

To info on running a lightning node?  Not off hand I'm rolling on mobile right now but AA talks about it if you want to search his vids

Pray for me, I think I may be dying slowly over the next two weeks

They already have the authority to check cellphones at the border and are already doing it.  A new law might remove some legal ambiguity but it won't change the fact that it is already happening

RIP Coinbase (just got the email myself and came to make this very post.  So Excited!)

Cloud nodes don't help decentralization so I'm not really interested in paying someone else to run a node that others can flip off like a switch at their (or at a politicians) whim
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:55:54
What the hell did I just watch
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:11:30
They might not have rolled it out to you yet but in doing research today it looks like they are rolling it out to everybody and just not telling them

At this point, with Bitcoin having legal standing in many countries, attempting this would be a crime in many jurisdictions.  Not to mention that it isn't really feasible to do.  OK, so you have money, how are you going to buy all the hardware without A) it getting noticed and B) funding the hardware producer to produce more hardware to work against you.  
A government attack is not out of the question at all but this route is in no way whatsoever the route they would use. 0% chance

You calm down.  I'm EXCITED.  Bitmain has promised to take their ball and go home!
