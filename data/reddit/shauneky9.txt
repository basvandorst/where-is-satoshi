Can you PM me your wallet address for a tip? I just got $300 worth I wouldn’t have before.

All frys and microcenters are like this by me. Thankfully I already have a 1080ti.

As someone who has started putting 10% of their income back each check, and investing another 10% into coins, having 17k~ in my savings sounds delish. Not quite there, yet, though.

You dilweed. No is one panic selling over JP Morgan. Of course they're going to yell fraud - it poses a threat to their livelihood. They're textbook case of fraud.
It's china. China, china, china /Trumpvoice. Chill. 
I want them out of the market already so we can resume with healthy growth if this is all that will result.

100% agree. I love that a majority of the community has thrown up a middle finger to China and said "no more". It's a sign of positive, sustainable growth when one entity cannot disrupt the ecosystem like they have in the past.

Oh I bet there were a couple, no doubt. And I meant "dilweed" in the most friendly, "nudge-your-shoulder" type of way lol.
The people that sold due to JP Morgan's stance are idiotic or day traders. Of course centralized institutions are going to oppose crypto :S. We've already established legitimacy, and their words confirm the threat. The next interesting hurdles will be their lobbying and regulations to come. If and when crypto jumps over that hurdle - "to the moon"
