Yes i have been analysing a lot of coins and have been feeling like something big is coming, i saw a coin shoot up over 3000% today but could go back down by tomorrow. How on earth can you call it beforehand? I expect a big price to come of bitcoin but thats only from thimgs ive read. Its dropped quite consistently since ive been watching

Yes its been on a relatively downward spiral for a while now. Curious to see what makes it go up if anything or will it fall apart in the instance that actual currency flops, there will be nothing to buy the bitcoin with as technically it relys on people purchasing with real money

Yeah you defo need to research platforms etc. I read an interesting one about mike tyson investing 100mil into one platform may be worth a punt

Thats good advice. Thanks. How long would you say to hold on average? Or would you do it via a forex trading platform rather than buy and hold? Its hard for me to keep my eye on it with family/work etc. Il have to dedicate some time a day/week towards it

Its equacoin a low volume coin. Its gone another 435% in the last 24 hours. Go on coinranker.com and arrange by last 24 bour growth. Not alwats easy to get hold of these coins tho

Yeah very true. Its so hard to find cutting edge news to get in on the ground(ish) floor on these coins. They all toot thier own horn if you research and end up on thier site. Nightmare

i am concerned about the way the market is right now, im hoping that another boom is imminent, and provided the price does go up i might have found the answer to making money from nothing. Have you ever done cloud mining? I found a site the about 3 days ago [coin\-nova.com/welcome/partner/22525]( and ive nearly mined 0.01 of litecoin. should be done by the end of the day. i think i may have found a way to kill it without a gpu/cpu. this is step one which will take about a week, then its all growth from there. check my profile out if you want to get in on it :\)
