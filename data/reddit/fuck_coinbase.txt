Good luck!  Look at Bitsquare sometime :)
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:07:27
You should be sorry.
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:09:21
Hey buddy!
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:08:00
Until they seize your coins.
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:07:12
Shun! Shhhuuunnnnn!
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:09:48
A week older than me! Nice!
Much respect.
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:10:04
We have a club forming up.
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:35:38
Mmmm delicious, how can I prove my suitability for modship, O wise one?
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:09:32
How about this one?
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:04:22
The latter is better.
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:07:00
Don't come back here whining when Coinbase screws your pooch
@_date: 2017-02-19 03:56:35
I don't think I have to say anything for you to know my opinion.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:04:03
Brian Armstrong wrote an article saying that controlling your own wealth is a **human right.**
You don't simply obey the government when they order you to do something that you believe is against human rights.
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:06:37
I do not.
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:07:46
Womp womp...
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:03:38
It's always the same story with Coinbase...
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:37:10
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:00:31
Another happy Coinbase customer!
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:03:20
Hey &gt;:D
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:58:28
This is good advice!
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:59:34


@_date: 2017-01-27 02:13:24
Did (800) 343-5845 work for you?
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:35:14
"The default EB setting is fine," they said.
Or "Bitcoin node operators don't need their hand held--they'll change their settings if need be."
Well, well, well...
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:33:12
Join my club, friend.
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:00:11
I'm not but I'd still endorse this recommendation.
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:57:59
EDIT: Rosie, stop downvoting me!
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:58:47
Unless you use their Vault
But don't use their Vault
Don't use their services at all
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:14:05
Gemini, Kraken, itBit, BitSquare, LocalBitcoins, Mycelium, Paxful (in order of trustworthiness)
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:58:18
Try itBit?
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:15:41
What can ya say?
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:00:53
Called it!  NIce!
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:58:59
alas... that is why education is necessary
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:12:02
What else?
@_date: 2017-01-30 23:08:42


@_date: 2017-01-27 02:17:53
Well if your coins are with Coinbase then you may be fucked if you're "sketchy" (definition TBD)
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:12:36
and it *just* **damn** _WORKS_
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:59:14
Making a stink on Reddit is the  way to get their motherfucking attention
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:01:31
Ask the gubmunt wat to do
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:16:20
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:01:18
Joinmarket, duh.
r/joinmarket for the lazy
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:15:19
Look forward to the *next* 2 months &gt;:}
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:58:10
itBit is also good.
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:13:44
Let's make a quest of it :)
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:12:59
Kraken, Gemini, itBit
and let's not forget BITSQUARE!
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:16:35
Someone bot me
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:12:10
How did Brian respond?
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:41:52
Cue the "Coinbase stol emy coins!!1" posts in 3... 2... 1...
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:42:19
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:42:38
Thank you for your message, comrade.
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:44:39
Always glad to hear that I have new friends
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:56:27
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:42:09
Probably the only good thing coinbase has ever done
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:55:20
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:32:51
Hodl on, registering fuck_jaxx...
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:51:19
Still, though
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:57:53
Nobody listens to me
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:32:31
Evidence won't help you, plebs
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:04:55
Nobody ever listens to me
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:35:39
Because ^^^
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:33:15
Bittrex is *alright*
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:28:06
Lube up, buckaroo.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:31:51
Told ya so.
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:46:24
With the law Coinbase treats its customers (hint: ^^^ ) I'm honestly flabbergasted that anyone would defend them whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:32:11
I've been saying this for forever.
