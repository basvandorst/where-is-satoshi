Also Bitcoin is actively developing tech that makes exchanges obsolete.

IOTA is premined. I would hold the old players while you're still figuring everything out. Buy some LTC, trade into BTC if you feel like it. Read about the Alts, very critically. A lot of these Alts won't be here past a short window of time.

Not really because it's actually possible to analyze a roulette table by using probabilistic mathematics, TA isn't math. It's just lines dragged and dropped with a line drawing tool on top of a graph.

How long until $BTC rise versus the dollar is seen as weak confidence in $USD?

Your friend's criticisms are valid, blockchain isn't that revolutionary or complex. But then again, neither is a light bulb that complex and it took us 300 years to get from the original to the LED. He's wrong about it being worthless. It's deflationary so the value has to go up as long as it's still in use as currency, which it is and will continue to be.

Oh is decentralization becoming a buzzword now? I have serious doubts that Facebook will be truly decentralized. We'll probably have to start differentiating in our speech between Facebook style "decentralization" and true decentralization.

No I assume you're using this account and many others to spread bullshit, anger, fear, and mistrust.

It's useful as a currency.

I can get instant transfers with CC, and then psuedo instantly pay off my credit card. It's much quicker than waiting a week for coin base to charge my bank account.

I would recommend building a secondary insulated space inside of your garage, placing your miner inside of that, and then pumping the heat from that space into your garage, with the waste heat from the heat pump dumping into the garage. The garage will get even hotter than it was already, but at least you won't destroy your mining rig.

Wait, market cap is really calculated this way? It's not calculated by the amount of value in the coin's ecosystem?

If they're "cryptojacking" with permission from the user, i.e. ask if the user would prefer an ad based experience or a mining supported experience, I wouldn't call it jacking. That word implies lack of permission from the user.

fucking lol most TA anywhere I see it it's just arbitrary lines drawn by hopeful people

This is the most plausible theory I've heard so far. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:52:05
That's ridiculous. There needs to be a GDP metric for the different coins. I'd imagine the "top" coins would look a lot different.

The human mind is really good at two things: seeing patterns where there are none, and lying to itself. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:49:10
That's true, however there are other true observations that can be made of many independent random events. For example, as the number of spins tends towards infinity, the mean tends towards zero.
It's the **untrue** observations of random events that people tend to believe *as true* that get them in trouble.

Don't get so upset man, it's just Internet money. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:50:54
And when I say arbitrary, I mean mathematically arbitrary. Like as in there is no pattern.
