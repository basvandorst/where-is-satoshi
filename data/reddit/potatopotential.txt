I'm gonna sell jugs of air while I start to refer to air not breathed in through my jugs as air legacy. My jugs of air will just have a tiny spray of Febreeze in them. Then, I'll switch from Febreeze to people sneezing in them. When people get tired of my air, I'll bring out Air Classic, which are just empty jugs. I'll make billions!

Depends on how nice the box is.

What did you do with it? I'd love to read a compilation of stories from people that had a huge sum of btc and just curious what they did, when, their mindset, etc.

Thanks for the story. A lot of people remind us... what are the odds you would have held it at so and so price? It's more fantasy than a realistic probability that most that had enough to be multi millionaires become that rich. I would also assume most that did depended mostly on luck. Mainly, how lucky they didn't care to sell for a decent profit because they are that well off or those that were too lazy to sell or forgot password a few years, lol. Could be wrong. Perhaps those that had a really good feeling just don't share their stories as much because it would shape the market into a less profitable one and the ones with the knowledge have a huge edge.

Is this why SpongeBob is just all sponge?

Yeah. I'd either do this or sell when I have double my student loan debt at whatever price so I'm still in it to win it, but 100% change my life.

Plot twist. He spent it all on delicious balut and still had to beg.

Bloody? They are filled with a broth like goodness... Tried it a few times as a kid. Never liked them. I don't think they are disgusting. But also can't understand why people like them period. No part of the balut has nice texture. It's a mix of like three different layers all with horrible texture. Flavor isn't great either.

If it's hot now, you weren't supposed to light it prior to putting it in your ass.

No. He took a kidney from each before selling them. He ain't stupid.

Oh em gee.... it's not supposed to be. The first purchase of btc from Jan 1 2016 was one-tenth it's value now. These people are calculating based on buying one a day from that point, so all purchases range from 10x to 1x.

I've been investing in garden gnomes. Any chance you want to diversify your portfolio and trade?

I got an ad with this dude staring me at the face, saying "...because YOU are into cryptocurrency." I don't want to build a mining rig because I watched a bunch of cryptovideos. DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!!!
Sleeping on a purple bed that's "just right" and getting science based six pack abs though, sign me up.

Go to your boss and say, "Hey. We leave these computers on 24/7 anyway. You mind if I run a program in the background during off hours? This year's Christmas Party is on me. I'll also get you a lambo as a gift."
