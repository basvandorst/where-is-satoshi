It’s cot numbers and letters, very long, I think it’s a bitcoin address or something. Don’t know what to do with it. Keep getting pieces of memory flashbacks of me writing it down as well as reluctantly choosing a password. Don’t know what to do next

Ok. Thanks 
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:05:54
so far, I think what I have is the bitcoin address or wallet address \-\-starts with 1 and is about 34 characters long, then also another set of letters in 5 blocks which may be a recovery phrase. I will study carefully. thanks for all the help
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:51:28
It’s a 1 and I think I had a password. Now I’m going through my email from 2011 till 2016 (loads) for any hint of a name of wallet. Thanks a lot. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:22:53
how do I find these public keys with non\-zero ballance?
I dont even remember the website I bought it from
either 2011 or if the password I have in mind is correct, then 2013/2014 maximum

starts with 1

Second string of numbers which I thought was meaningless. Now I think that I may have the bitcoin address and wallet address but not sure why I think there was also a word like password?
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:08:28
will do. will take my time but will give results to this very helpful forum regardless of outcome
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:28:15
No. I wish it was. That second string of numbers may be something else but the first string of 34 numbers seems like an address. I’m combining my emails. Also working on DIY old hard drive search.  Wish me luck.

Still studying my new wallet CAREFULLY. thanks
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:57:42
Thanks. Very useful info.

did mymonero exist in 2013/14? ill investigate, thanks
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:32:09
How? Been trying to find out how to check this. Will keep all informed. Thanks
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:23:15
Absolutely not sure. Was student then so probably paid token sum. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:17:41
Certainly. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:06:22
not sure how to do this. no such facility. need to study this better 
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:29:14
No, just one word which I used as a password in those days but have not used since. Thats why I think it may be 2013/2014. The certificate printout was for that year range.
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:32:45
I will study this option for 100&amp; safety and get back to you if it works
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:50:12
Hi. just signed up at [blockchain.info]( suprisingly my wallet address looks familiar to another set of letters and numbers which I did not mention\-\-\- I thought people would think I was stupid or silly. I now think that this second set of numbers looks so much like my just signed for [blockchai]( address. I will carefully pursue this line. Thought I should feed you back honestly. Thanks so much. I will tread very carefully
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:45:52
Yet to do the search. Not ready to put anything online yet. Still looking for the key before doing anything. I know it’s written somewhere. I’ve dug through 20% of my old paper files cabinet today. Was studying back then so probably spent a few quid at best. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:44:06
Yes. 5-5-5-5-5. Each 5 means 5 mostly Letters but with numbers making up a block of 5 characters. I’m not sure what it is. 
The next string is about 34 numbers and letters starting with 1. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:20:42
Dont know what it is? but I remember flash back style writing it down in annoyance as the site said I had to store it secretly for access. fragments of memory. possibly cos I found it cumbersome
