I have a Trezor and I would like to monitor the coins in those addresses via google sheet with: 
I have generated 4 fresh addresses with my Trezor and sent bitcoin to them.  The odd thing is that when I look at the balance of those 4 addresses, the total balance does not match the balance showing my Trezor UI.
This leads me to think there are somehow some hidden wallet addresses I'm not seeing in the Trezor UI.  I looked at on one of my test transactions and am trying to make sense of this.  I'm not sure how safe it is to post a link to one of my transactions but details are as follows:
-I had previously sent x btc to a Trezor address
-I then sent y btc (smaller than x) from my Trezor to another address 
-If I click on the y btc withdraw transaction in Trezor, it shows that x btc was sent from the original address to two 2 addresses.  y btc landed in one address I wanted to send it to (expected) and [x-y-fees] landed in another random new address (unexpected).
So it looks like instead of pulling y bitcoin out of the original address and leaving [x-y-fees] in the original address, it created a brand new address to hold the [x-y-fees].
Do I own this new address and it's just not showing in the Trezor UI?  Does anybody understand my confusion here?

Got it, thank you!  Do you know if there is an easy way to monitor what change addresses have been created by my Trezor?  It looks like only way to know is click on the transaction to see the new address created.  
I just want to know all the addresses my Trezor uses so I can monitor them in Google Sheets.  If they create a new address every time I withdraw that's going to be annoying for tracking.
