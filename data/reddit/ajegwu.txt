What's not fine is that many (millions?) people, including Paul Krugman, think that reading an article about Bitcoin written by Paul Krugman somehow equates to learning about Bitcoin.  It isn't.  He's acting like, and perceived as, an authority on the subject.  He isn't.  
He's written how many articles on the subject now?  Half a dozen?  
In his latest, that I mentioned above, he says, "I have had and am continuing to have a dialogue with smart technologists who are very high on BitCoin — but when I try to get them to explain to me why BitCoin is a reliable store of value, they always seem to come back with explanations about how it’s a terrific medium of exchange. Even if I buy this (which I don’t, entirely), it doesn’t solve my problem. And I haven’t been able to get my correspondents to recognize that these are different questions."
To summarize:
- He doesn't understand Bitcoin.
- He's having conversations with people that understand Bitcoin.
- They're telling him that he's asking the wrong questions and looking from the wrong angle.  It was never designed to be a store of value.  It may never be a good store of value.  No one that I'm aware of is working towards the goal of making it a better store of value.  
- His response to this is to continue to drive the conversation about a concept he doesn't grasp.
His job at this point, if he is to be recognized as a journalist, an academic, an educator, a commentator, an author, or whatever title he's wearing at the moment is to shut up and learn.  He's out of his element here and yelling at the top of his lungs to drown out anyone that doesn't agree with his opinion that was effectively plucked out of thin air.
This is completely dishonest, and unacceptable behavior from the most highly regarded economist IN THE WHOLE WORLD.  Seriously, fuck this guy.
As I've already explained, Bitcoin is much more than a currency.  The payment network without the currency is extremely valuable.  The currency without the payment network is completely worthless.  If you look at it like you'd look at a currency, like Krugman is, you'd be very wrong.  
Investing in Bitcoin is a completely different discussion, but my thought is that buying bitcoin and putting into a wallet and sitting on it is not investing.  That's buying.    
Companies building the global infrastructure, like BTCChina, New &amp; Bee, and BitInstant, for example, are investing in Bitcoin.

The dollar is not mentioned in the Declaration of Independence. It doesn't talk about the problems that the dollar will solve or how it accomplish those goals. It doesn't explain the intricacies of the dollar creation and regulation process in plain English. It has nothing to do with the dollar. At all. 
The Bitcoin white paper does that. Apparently you're a stupid lazy cunt that thinks the white paper talks about making wallets or setting up a miner or some shit.

I don't want him buying in, trying to take control, mining, trading, or otherwise manipulating Bitcoin at all, to be honest. 
But, Blythe Masters used to be Global Head of Commodities at JP Morgan and has left to start some kind of "blockchain" company, so you know he's already in.

That's a very edgy opinion to hold, but let's be honest, Blythe Masters is a Master of the Universe. 
She doesn't lose or make money. She wields money like a battle mage. 
Everyone knows about the commodity market manipulation when she was at JP Morgan. She's one of those people beyond making laws for themselves. She just doesn't give a shit and will never be in trouble for anything.

That is definitely the highest remaining technical barrier.  I think most major brands can be listed with clear instructions to boot from USB.

Hi, I'm OP's brother and partner.
I don't think the technical barrier it anywhere near too high for people that come to the Bitcoin subreddit, but that really isn't our target audience.  We're just trying to vet the idea here.
That Windows installation option prevents creation of the persistent volume, which I think is a very important part of Tails.  That page recommends following the Tails USB installer instructions, which just give you a link to the Ubuntu install directions and tell you to replace the Ubuntu iso with the Tails iso.  I think this is a weak point in Tails' otherwise stellar documentation.  
Again, I'm not thinking of Bitcoin followers for this service, but someone like an older relative who is suddenly (and probably unnecessarily) concerned about their Privacy wanting the easiest path to reasonably assuaging those fears.

Hi, I'm OP's brother and partner.
Ha, the numbers are very accurate!
You bring up a lot of good points and ask a lot of great questions.
I think one of the great things about Tails is that new versions come out on a roughly monthly basis, and outside of that, they claim it is designed to be much more secure not running any updates.  
I may need to rewrite the description to be more clear that Tails isn't a magic bullet, but there are benefits when it is presented like this.  I don't think burning DVDs and make bootable USB sticks are crucial skills unless you're worried about man-in-the-middle attacks, and I'm attempting to be a mitm with integrity.  Also, learning a new UI is difficult and annoying to many people.  The Windows XP camouflage option makes that a lot less jarring.  Tails gets people right into a familiar computing environment, forces them to deal without awful browser plug-ins, and puts PGP at their fingertips.  I hacked together a Quick Start guide today out of the documentation and try to guide customers towards better practices.  It will evolve over time.
In all honesty, while I see a sudden (and probably unnecessary) explosion in demand for something like this, I think it will be short lived.  Unfortunately, I find it likely that many people will stop being concerned with online privacy as the PRISM and Snowden stories disappear from the media. Most will never consider it at all.

I'll give you that gold isn't "magical" but I don't think anyone here is discussing the supernatural properties of money.
Gold's value is decided by a market.  A market with buyers and sellers that bid, then buy and sell when they agree on a price.  I don't believe any market is free from manipulation, but arbitrary is clearly the wrong word.
Gold was not chosen as a store of wealth because of any magical properties it was imagined to have, nor was it chosen arbitrarily.  It was chosen because of all the material known to man thousands of years ago, it was the best thing available to do the job.  Here is an easy to understand explanation 
It is still a store of wealth, because no one has come up with a better alternative yet.
It's quite debatable if getting off the gold standard was good or not, but there is no question about the dire consequences of replacing it with a 100% fiat system worldwide allowing for unlimited credit expansion.  We're all suffering for it.
The total amount of gold in the entire world ever mined is estimated to be a cube about 20 meters on each side.  That's not very big.  The total amount is understood to be around 6 billion troy ounces.  That's less than an ounce per person.  That's not nearly as rare or scarce as plenty of other stuff, but scarcity needs to be limited for it to have any use as money.

We can't do that yet. Do to the anmesiac nature of Tails, if you install an application and shut down the system, all traces of the app disappear. 
I think a future version of Tails will support installing applications to the persistent volume, and saving them and the configuration.   For this to be to remain totally anonymous and private, I really can't preconfigure persistence, as that would need the end users encryption passphrase.

It needs to be understood that there are two things named Bitcoin. 
One is a global peer to peer payment processing network that is cryptographically secured by the blockchain preventing double spending and not requiring trust between any two parties. It can send almost any amount of money to almost anyone almost instantaneously without any corporation or government's permission. It is revolutionary and unlike anything ever seen on earth. It has gone from an interesting idea to an entire industry with billions of dollars in infrastructure in place, and it is being adopted rapidly, worldwide. 
The other thing called Bitcoin is the only currency accepted on that payment network. That gives it tremendous value. Maybe you don't see it, but millions, if not billions, of people do.

I'm probably misunderstanding this, but I figured that if a bunch of people booted Tails DVDs and ran the Tails USB installer on blank USB drives, they'd all be exactly the same.  Especially due to the amnesiac nature of Tails.  Even if you do update your packages (which they recommend against) the changes will be reverted by the next boot.  I won't ship any of these with a persistent volume.
