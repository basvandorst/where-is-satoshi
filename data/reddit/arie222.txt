No one is adopting it as a currency though. That is my point. It is only expanding because people are using it as a short term investment device. Do you not see how this is problematic?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:41:49
And what power do they have? What will be the consequences of price manipulation?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:08:49
Is my take any less retarded than the top users take? Let me ask you this, how has bitcoin improved in the last month to justify the doubling in value? If anything, it becomes less and less useful as a currency everyday.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:10:03
In that sense literally everything can be considered a store of value. But there are significantly better comparisons though. Weren't Beanie Babies considered a store of value during their peak? That seems like a better comparison to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:25:32
Precious metals have literal value. Gold has more uses that storing value and looking pretty.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:39
See step 1. Buying is the long position.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:34:46
What? The transaction volume is due to people buying and selling bitcoin. It is not due to people exchanging bitcoin for goods.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:03:28
The point of gold being a store of value is that it will always have value. Sure it swings up and down but there is no downside risk of it being worthless. Again, bitcoin is literally the opposite.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:21:54
Why would it be stupid to have sold at a higher price than bitcoin is currently trading at? More money &gt; less money last time I checked.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:47
Then sell. This is not complicated.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:44:12
Potential for sustainable microtransactions? That's the best you've got?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:23:18
A shill? Can I actually get paid for this? Is so can you point me to how I can make that happen? Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:27:25
Of course. But they are still uses. And having use as a cosmetic accessory is still a tangible use. I mentioned in another comment, but if people stopped caring about it's aesthetic attributes it is likely the price would significantly decrease which would probably open it up to having more commercial usee
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:33:24


How are they illegal in relation to bitcoin? Who is the regulatory body that will be monitoring the actions? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:45
Gold is a good conductor of electricity and has commercial applications because of that. I would imagine that if people didn't care for its use as jewelry and the price came down it would be used a lot more commercially.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:01:23


What do you think is happening now?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:15:03
Gold has tangible value because it has uses outside of strictly being a financial device.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:58:40
It will have always weathered the storm until it hasn't. In which case it will be too late.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:49:17
Why do so many people that post here have such new accounts?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:57:01
Terrible for small users since there aren't any regulations on large scale price manipulations. Wall St is going to come in and extract the shit out any gains that are there to take at the expense of the average user.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:42:11
I'm confused. I thought bitcoin was a currency. Is that no loner the case?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:23:57
This conversation is based around the futures market opening. Which it has not done yet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:30:06
Likely not. If it's currently being used at it's price levels it is clearly very valuable. No way it would drop that precipitously. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:56:07
You should listen to your dad.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:54:24
Wait I thought Bitcoin was a currency. Why would people need to sell it in order to buy things?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:42
How is it useful as a wealth store house? It's literally only useful as a short term investment to make quick money right now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:01:47
I'm not sure  why it surprised anyone. This is just what happens in unregulated markets.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:36:14
But Bitcoin is not being used. There is seriously low transaction volume. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:01
Because the likely end of bitcoin is exactly what your dad describes. Just no one knows when or how high it will get before that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:59:09
From a comment below not by me:
1.They buy 100k bitcoins. 
2.They short it in the futures market.
3.They sell 100k bitcoins.
4.Take profits from shorting futures.
5.Repeat step 1
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:58:04
How are bitcoin and gold in any way similar? Gold is a tangible asset.
