You must be killing it with those CoinBase referrals!

For future payments, you may want to use Revolut. When I send SEPA payments with Revolut, they seem to get to coinbase within 2-3 days.

Because arguably, if the fees were equally low / free, then even financial institutions would prefer the security of a decentralized currency over a centralized one. Bitcoin with lighting network, or alternatives, could provide this.

Personally I think it's BS. There is only one true Bitcoin. I could be wrong. Whatever you do, don't transfer any BTC to any wallet that's owned by them.

No, it just means that I have no more fiat available to invest without taking out a loan, which is not something I'm going to do.
Yes, I do believe that someone else will buy Bitcoin again higher and higher price. That is literally the whole point of investing in literally anything - be it Bitcoin, Gold, USD, Amazon etc.

Or maybe the sell-off of altcoins is just people buying BTC because they think it will go up now?

I sent from coinbase to GDAX (free) and then GDAX to electrum (free). GDAX covers the fee for withdrawals. Not all exchanges do. 
It was just one transaction. It was confirmed 10 times within an hour. Google "Bitcoin confirmations" if that doesn't make sense - basically the transaction gets confirmed by the blockchain, which is what makes Bitcoin secure.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:26:22
No idea but I see no reason why they would choose to do that when they are using bitcoin.com as a sales platform to confuse people into buying BTC - probably the same people who think they can't buy Bitcoin because it costs too much.

Sell bch and buy literally anything else

You realize many of the "richest" BTC addresses are exchange addresses? Also, there's nothing stopping people from spreading their BTC across multiple addresses (actually a good idea in order to minimize risk if one is hacked).
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:11:43
I don't. Keep your Bitcoin in cold storage. Not on coinbase or any other exchange. You can buy and sell Bitcoin with real people if you don't want to do it on an exchange. And yes, whales can sell all their coins to try and alter the market, but that's just so that they can rebuy them at a cheaper price - the long-term price will continue to go up in my opinion.
Bitcoin isn't perfect. Other crypto exists. Invest in ideas that you believe in. If you believe in USD, invest in that.

Dude are you genuinely suggesting that Bitcoin has an adoption rate of over 50% ? We are barely at 1% 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:30:24
Bitcoin Cash is a worthless ugly Bitcoin imposter. It dresses as Bitcoin by using Bitcoin.com and and tricks newbies into thinking it is the real Bitcoin. It's not. But that's their whole sales tactic. The reason that is anti-bitcoin is because the imposter is pretending to be the original.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:48:15
If you tried to buy from Bitcoin.com you haven't purchased any Bitcoin. You have purchased Bitcoin Cash, which is completely different (in my opinion it's a scam). It trades off Bitcoin's name but is not Bitcoin. As soon as you receive your Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) you should sell it for USD (you'll likely make a little loss here) and then buy Bitcoin ($BTC) on Coinbase or Gemini or something like that
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:08:50
As I said, Ripple could be a good short-term bet, but as soon as Bitcoin adds it, I can see Ripple losing a lot of value.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:04:03
If it's just a few $ just keep it there. Fees are too high to send BTC right now in my opinion. If it's a sizeable amount then it's best to keep it in cold storage

I transferred to electrum and within an hour had around 10 confirmations. Set up electrum now and it should be fine. That said, I personally believe the fork is gonna be a shitcoin

I've already bought as much BTC as I can afford, and it was for more than the current value, but I'm not fussed because I believe the value will increase.

Ha yes. Always happens to me too.

If you believe it will take over fiat currencies then do some maths and figure out a valuation:
(Total amount of fiat in USD) ÷ 21 million = maximum price per Bitcoin
Hint, it's over $15k

First few days after buying in at ATH were horrible, had nightmares and shit. Now i'm glued to GDAX watching lines move about. Still think I'll see long-term gains though
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:41:30
BCH goes against everything BTC is about. It's run by a megalomaniac that's interested only in his own profits. In that respect, it is no different to fiat, except that he is legally allowed to do insider trading on it - as he has done this week, to many peoples detriment. BCH just piggybacks off Bitcoin's good name and would be worth circa $0.05 if it had any other name. Avoid like the plague.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:50:54
The main reason for me is that, unlike fiat currency, there is a limited amount of Bitcoin that will ever exist. This means that a central power (government) can't decide to just print new money (see: Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Germany in early 20th century). When a government prints new money it means that existing money becomes devalued. Bitcoin is a safe storage of value. 
That said, it is a RISK. You can see from the last two days that it can go up and down in the blink of an eye. My advice, don't buy if you can't leave your investment in for at least 5 years. By that time you'll realize that the end goal is never to sell, but to have as much Bitcoin when it becomes more widely adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:27:19
If you want the fork, download electrum. Then, move your coins from coinbase to GDAX (free) and then from GDAX to your electrum wallet (free).
You really shouldn't keep your coins in an exchange in any case.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:31:30
Yes but it's a scam. It's not the segwit2x fork from a few weeks ago, they are just reusing the name. Read the PSA in link: 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:36:50
This. Which one will be "worth more" depends on whether you think a centralized solution will be more appealing than a decentralized one. Personally I think Ripple will go up short term but not long term. Maybe worth trying to ride the wave for a while, that's up to you.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:13:10
That was posted on CB before the fork was called off. The FAQ is not referring to the new fork, as it was written beforehand. CoinBase are not fortune tellers, although I would forgive you for thinking they are after the insider trading shit from last week.

"please note that these timelines are no longer valid". Basically the airdrop happening around 28th December is nothing to do with the proposed hard fork from a few weeks ago that eventually never happened. Coinbase will probably never support this new fork, or won't for a long time.

You should do a SEPA Payment to GDAX and then buy it. Helps reduce the fees. Paying with a credit or debit card costs more because CB has to pay visa / MasterCard around 1% per transaction
