That's hard to say right now. It would depend on how many payments you are going to route. You have to pay fees for opening and closing payment channels, so I think it would be good to leave the channels open for several weeks.

Do you mean hardware specs?
As you should run a full node on the same machine, it should be the same specs like running the full node itself. I don't think that the LN nodes will need noticeably more performance.

Yes, you can earn fees for routing payments through your LN node.

There is  that offers such a voting system. Unfortunately it is not independant. Bitcoin.com is pro BU, so are most of their users.

Great talk. Can't wait for lightning to become usable.

True, but they can never used as inputs. So these coins are lost forever.

Yes, but it has no right to pretent to be bitcoin.

Yeah I would like to buy a Tesla with Bitcoin in a few Years. That would be awesome :)
