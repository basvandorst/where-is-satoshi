Weekly pep talk.

Your *only* response to "Bitcoin being technology" is "side chains". You've used it in every reply so far. Honestly who gives a shit except Bitcoin people. 
Frankly if that's your only justification for this then I'm glad Bitcoin is blocked. You can talk about it in your own personal sub where all Bitcoin news is allowed @_date: 2014-04-09 17:43:25
Dude! You must not get it, someone mentioned bitcoin in *real life*!
Also, the barista *totally* made this on their own without any solicitations. It was *totally* randoms!

Silk Road aside (and the good I do believe it did when compared to addicts getting their drugs on the streets from random dealers), the guy was a dumbass. 
Now, I don't know if paying to have people killed multiple times is worthy of a life sentence alone, but he's no innocent middleman. Regardless of the possible subjectivity people feel to hosting a relatively safe drug market, the guy objectively performed other stupid crimes. 
The entire case is not really comparable.

Everything I've heard is that there's no way this filibuster will work to actually *prevent* anything, only to delay it and amendments to the bill; and that it seems more like a publicity stunt than anything. I mean, there's already people in this thread that he should be president because of this. 






So while technically a successful filibuster may delay something, it's not preventing senate vote on the bill at all.

Tell that to the majority of comments here acting like he's the second coming of Christ for delaying the inevitable.

It’s like saying it’s difficult to saddle a horse or attach a cart in the 1800s. 
Sure, I don’t know anyone who could do it now, but I’m sure nearly everyone could do that back then. 
The same would apply if I asked my kid to telnet into a BBS. Conversely, it’s ridiculous (to me in this context) that I saw an earlier comment saying something like “it was tough because you didn’t have broadband”.

Is it even worth it to mine BTC with a regular ol' computer? Like, can you even earn 1 or 2 or even 5 in a pool?
Or is this whole thing pretty much useless now unless you spend $2,000 on a rig with 16 graphics cards fused with the blood of Satan?
(if the article mentions this, sorry. It's not loading for me and I obviously don't know much about BtC)

I don't really think this is an example of domain squatting, and that in itself isn't entirely subjective. 
For example, if you managed to own britneyspears.com and ran a fan site for her, or were yourself named Britney Spears, you probably wouldn't be running afoul of any laws. You would also be entitled to recoup time, money, and effort that you put into it if you were to sell it. 
However, if you're like one of my dumbass friends and buy up a name (for an up and coming football star that at the time was likely or did end up in the NFL, I don't recall exactly), while trying to sell it to the guy after-the-fact while at the same time doing nothing with the domain itself, well then there are squatting laws against that. 
Maybe someone has been screwed and deemed a "squatter" while actually utilizing a domain, but I don't think it's as arbitrary as you make it sound. Especially when you have legal rights and a "brand" associated to your legal name in most other scenarios where profit is tied to your name alone.

It's probably a safe bet that most voters against encryption are completely ignorant on the subject and think that's exactly how a Blackfoot (yeah, that's what I meant autocorrect fuck you) would work. 
They constantly get told on the media that's how "terrorists win"..... Shit, the one NPR bit I heard about the Paris raid info being ascertained from wherever (texts?), they didn't mention it was unencrypted (this was after I read info about it online, so I don't know if they're talking about it now).
