Offline wallets are very secure, allowing them to have almost no way of it getting stolen. Your coinbase account can only be accessed if the hacker has access to your phone. Coinbase is safe, Ledger is safest.

- 1: you will need a credit card and an identity. 18+
- 2: Coinbase.com is the best place in my opinion to buy bitcoin
- 3: create an account and get your ID verified (no more than 5 mins)
- 4: Link a Credit Card or bank account
- 5: BUY
- 6: i would activate 2-step authentication to keep them the most secure.

Ledger nano. Its an offline wallet, and in that, your bitcoins are as safe as you can make them. Just keep that in a safe place until the end of time :)

Afraid to say, but im pretty sure you gotta sync the whole thing. If you have 5k bitcoin in there, im sure its worth the wait.
- edit: i think 75 million dollars is worth a 5 day wait!!!
- edit 2: i think 150 Lamborghini aventadors is worth the wait!!! 
- edit 3: I THINK 75000 IPHONE Xs IS WORTH IT
- edit 4: when you realize you sent $105k to your friends as a joke
- edit 5: when you realize you can change 100 redditors lives and still have 70 million (im dying here)
- edit 6: you can get hella dippin dots not to mention
- edit 7: you can afford movie theater snacks (i know it was bad)
- edit 8: good luck sleeping tonight lmao
- edit 1mil: if you manage to get 5 thousand btc, help me finish my pc and get my dad a new gpu :)
- edit 1.1mil: ill keep editing until i hear that the bitcoins are safe
