They lived in a very nice house and had 2 BMWs in the driveway.  Why would you just assume they need the money more than me?

In the us you're limited to $1000 volume per day. Plus you have pay taxes on earnings. $20 per day is not worth a 5k investment

Are you a lawyer or have anything legal precedent to support this assertion?
@_date: 2014-11-22 01:07:11
I will bet you 1 btc we see 300 before we see 400. Deal?

Thanks for your helpful post.

I did actually

I am the OP of linked thread (The guy who found the laptop).  I spoke to a lawyer last week about the incident and feel like i can offer some legal prospective. A few points:
(1) Digital goods and physical goods are treated very differently. Analogies like "Well if i find your keys, do i own your car?" are irrelevant. Access is clearly different than ownership.
(2) The analogy, "well if i find your bank account password do i own the money in your bank account?" is also a poor analogy.  The issue here is legally know as the "expectation of privacy"  You have a password in the first place to prevent unauthorized access.  Therefore any authorized access is a violation of that expectation.  And again, access does not equate to ownership.
(3) The fact that the private keys were unencrypted nor password protected is important.  If i would have "hacked" protected information then I likely would have committed a crime
The case with possessing a private key is obviously much more complicated. Its probably the case that bitcoin will be treated more like "cash" than like a bank account in the eyes of the law due to this expectation of privacy and ownership.
Therefore here are a few scenarios that might be similar:
-Finding a sack of money in someones garbage
-Finding out a painting you purchased for a few dollars if worth a fortune
-Finding some gold coins hidden away in a desk you purchased.
Basically, because I acted in good faith as a buyer (i didnt know the bitcoins were on the computer) and the seller made no effort to secure the bitcoins, I have most likely not done anything illegal.  I am also under go obligation to return or compensate the seller.
If i did something unethical or not is for all you to decide.
While we are on the subject of ethics, its interesting to note that I have received several dozen messages from people claiming that the laptop was theirs.

It should be obvious to you why I'm not going to do that.  Not sure about the legal implications of what I have done.

You can't cancel an order that has been placed. Sorry
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:04:17
Thanks.  I've learned so much about bitcoin this last week.
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:32:16
Pathetic bro
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:28:47
Thats a pretty good idea.  I think something totally anonymous like that would be a nice gesture.
@_date: 2014-11-22 01:15:38
We can put the bitcoin in escrow. Cool?
@_date: 2014-11-22 01:54:53
Haha feeling?! Have any data? If not keep your idiot random gibberish to yourself
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:22:10
It was a very nice couple in their late 50s. No idea who originally owned the laptop.
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:10:48
wow, thats so insightful!
@_date: 2014-11-16 02:37:46
Going down to 300 for sure
@_date: 2014-11-22 01:53:29
Sell! Sell! Sell!
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:34:35
Why would you be "sure" about that? You don't know those people.  I appreciate your opinion but Id rather be safe than sorry.
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:59:16
This situation is nothing like what youre describing. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:29:22
I worry it could get traced back to me when I sell them at coinbase.

You can download an offline decrypter from github and store it on a usb drive.
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:37:24
Why would I tip you? Youre not even being helpful.

Obvious shill. Service is 9% more than circle. Avoid
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:56:03
What makes you think I'm lying about being safe?
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:59:24
Not a bad idea
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:32:54
What do you mean by "reward"?
