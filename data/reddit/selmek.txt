Breaking news: the SNB pegs Swiss Franc to Bitcoin :D

The product was sold to another company more than a year ago. I don't know the new company behind it but could get in touch with the early developers if necessary. In the worst case, the key exporter tool indeed works well: be careful during this process however as your key will be temporarily exposed.

Pardon my ignorance, but how do you validate the outcome of the prediction in a decentralized prediction market? What is the rule to decide whether outcome 1 or outcome 2 has occurred?
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:56:07
I would definitely. Is it subject to a NDA?

I (silently) agree with your remark but won't get the money for a sex related venture.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:54:23
Not profitable unfortunately...

Aren't there serious developers working on that already? If so, could you give me some references? Do you know if current colored coins implementations are mature enough to be used in such a project or if it would need to be built from scratch?

Then I'll be happy to read it carefully, thank you! As I'm no security expert, I might not have the expertise to validate your approach however.

Could you elaborate please? What would you publish on the blockchain precisely? I'm not sure to see what advantages it brings in comparison to a centralized yet open service.

I'll have to check with my lawyer but I'm not a US citizen and live in a very liberal country. I think there is no legal issue.

What would you think about eDollar &amp; eGold colored coins? Is that the kind of asset classes you're hoping to see? How developed are the colored coins / decentralized exchange implementations currently? Could I rely on existing implementations and issue the colored coins, or would I need to build the underlying tech too?

I agree with the need but I'm not sure a smartphone is the solution. I wouldn't personally carry a second smartphone. Also, I think smartphones aren't very robust.

Totally agree, and it is one of the two alternatives I am considering currently.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:57:21
Completely agree, even though we would lose decentralization.
