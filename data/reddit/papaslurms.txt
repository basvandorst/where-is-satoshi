Depends on quantities.  I've been banned by FinCEN.
@_date: 2019-07-22 22:20:59
Indeed it does.  Ironically, all my purchases are now made in cash at various BTC ATMs...
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:27:17
I feel ya.  Screw accountants.
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:18:56
I'm banned from US based exchanges :(
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:35:26
Fed had $4.5T to unwind, and were already down to $3T in a fairly short time.
No idea why you think that's funny.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:34:14
I'm fairly certain that the majority of the population isnt going to like paying for non-citizens healthcare via higher premiums for themselves.
Seems short sighted.
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:10:15
They aren't required to tell you why.  My guess, is that I deposited too much, converted to crypto, and then withdrew all funds.  Total was probably over $75k.
EDIT:  This wasn't done in 1 go, but was over the course of several months.  I suspect I threw up too many red flags, and our fine regulators deemed me high risk.  They probably thought I was laundering $$$.
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:19:48
The Fed is so far doing okay in unwinding, ECB and BOJ cannot unwind.
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:29:39
I believe they have only accepted 1M one single time (2015-2016).  Most years it is in the low 100k's.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:37:07
It's under $9k and closer to $6k.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:18:26
Oh yeah.  Got kicked out of 2 exchanges and rejected at a third.  Theres only I think 4 exchanges that accept ACH deposits.
I do have a legacy account on a different exchange before KYC that I have been utilizing.  But I can only deposit crypto and withdraw crypto (which is fine)
Edit: the above all occurred the same day, with Coinbase leading the pack.
@_date: 2019-07-22 23:58:44
Banks dont allow people to open business accounts if its crypto related.  At least every major bank and community bank in my area.
I tried...
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:38:07
1)  Banks cannot print money.  A loan must be made from a 3rd party.
2)  Correct, which is why I am long crypto.
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:13:51
Ah, so you believe a drug addict lying on the streets begging for more free dope is the same as a neurosurgeon treating someone with brain cancer?
Way to go there champ!
@_date: 2019-03-09 18:03:51
I will look into this over the weekend.  Thank you.
@_date: 2019-11-20 20:01:43
Well, I have some news for them:
@_date: 2019-11-07 19:43:06
Here's the issue.  People like to spend money in their free time.  So...they need to work, in order to have money to spend.
I guess that sums up my response.
@_date: 2019-11-07 14:51:05


So....slave labor.
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:44:04
Not everyone can use exchanges.  I'm very grateful theres some in my area.  6% buyers fee and 4% sellers fee.
I'm very happy with that.
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:38:10
No one would work if they didn't have to.  Without incentives, society falls apart.
@_date: 2019-03-09 17:58:08
Can you charge fees with Eclair?  I've been wanting to try and gain some extra BTC from my stash.  I've worked in Linux before, but setting up a LND channel seems above my experience level.
@_date: 2019-11-05 00:59:25
You're joking right?  The majority of the EU is in far worse financial shape than the US.
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:43:59
No one wants to pick up trash, clean gutters, pick up dog poop, clean human waste off of streets, give physicals, etc. unless they have to.
You're delusional if you believe people would want to build a house without getting paid.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:00:33
The literal definition of working is "paid employment"
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:17:09
Yeah....working and not getting paid is slavery.  No matter how you look at it.
@_date: 2019-11-08 01:46:41
If you're alive, you're consuming.  Not necessarily working.  Theres a difference between the two.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:39:03
That's the definition for a noun.  Were talking about an adjective.
@_date: 2019-11-07 21:33:12
You're comparing adults to children?  Further, those billionaires do cool shit, because they worked hard to be able to do so.  Quit expecting handouts, and instead, work on bettering yourself.
@_date: 2019-11-05 14:33:41
I'm going to caution you to be careful.  They may have only taken out a "withholding amount" which is a flat %.  You may owe more.
I always thought lottery winnings were treated as straight income, but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2019-11-04 22:23:41
That number sounds quite high for IL.  They too both federal and state/local out?
Surprised you were able to keep that much.
@_date: 2019-11-07 23:27:23
The natural state of kids is irrelevant.  They have no hormones, and underdeveloped brains and bodies.  Comparing kids to adults in order to make your argument is just ludicrous.  
Further, implying that people would work for no pay, specifically at jobs people dont like doing, is just...not a reasonable conversation in the first place.
Someone HAS to work.  Period.  If no one wants to work, society is toast.
@_date: 2019-11-07 18:45:27
Be a slave man, I'm not going to stop you from your dream.
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:33:41
Why would anyone work?
@_date: 2019-11-07 20:14:54
If we worked on our population issue, standard of living wouldn't have to decline...
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:57:19
Let me ask you a question:  When true DNA designer medications come out, and let's say they cost $1M.  Do you really think those other countries are going to pay for that?
They will not.  Which is my point.
@_date: 2019-08-06 22:30:17
Because it's about scarcity, in this case money for the best possible treatment.
Not everyone can have it, thus it must be rationed.  Promising everyone can have it is a lie that politicians tell to win elections.
@_date: 2019-08-11 22:27:41
Which is why the next system will have a base of a fixed supply, but will be supported by one that is endless.
@_date: 2019-08-24 02:45:16
That is quite the interesting perspective. 
Thank you
@_date: 2019-08-07 03:53:02
Considering both sides of aisle wont reduce the military, I'd say that wont be happening anytime soon, unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-08-22 14:51:45
I am unfortunately stuck using ATMs, as I have lost access to ACH transactions on every US based exchange :(
BTC ATM by my house has 8% buyers spread and a 4% seller spread.  Which I don't think is all that bad.
@_date: 2019-08-12 03:47:50
Thankfully, I never said the current system would need to change.  All that has to happen is for Central banks to accept crypto.  This allows them to print to their hearts content.
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:08:53
Everyone wants free healthcare like Medicaid.
Since healthcare costs money, not everyone can have free healthcare.
You still make the promise in order to get elected.
@_date: 2019-08-12 03:46:59
If countries back crypto currencies, meaning theyll accept them in trade, the base currency (crypto) has a fixed supply but its price is now supported by inflation via fiat.
@_date: 2019-08-03 03:15:38
Sell all your gold to shake that market as well.
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:58:25
What happens when genetic medications are released?  What if they all cost some extreme amount, do you honestly think those governments will pay for it?
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:55:13
Lol.  I saw that too.
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:08:53
The nordic social support system is supported from oil sales though....
It WILL eventually run out of cash.
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:47:47
That's actually not that bad of a spread.
@_date: 2019-08-03 03:16:50
That's because of the new Tax that stipulates I believe a 3% charge on houses worth above some huge amount.
@_date: 2019-10-10 22:26:08
I currently believe this may be the case as well.  The system died in 2008.  It's on expensive life support (QE), which all the 1st world countries rotated around like a game of hot potato.
@_date: 2019-08-27 17:37:19
I do!
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:22:54
You can purchase gold with btc on jmbullion
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:16:00
Might I suggest to transfer everything over to native segwit?
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:00:09


Ah, so bums who refuse to work get free treatment?  If they choose not to participate in society, they shouldn't get any of the rewards.
Further, there's a tipping point when that doesn't work well.  What happens in a recession and millions lose their jobs?  Does the portion the government removes from people's paychecks increase to cover the cost difference?
@_date: 2019-10-11 11:44:04
The entire fiat, central bank, bonds market system is toast.  Money has no value anymore, as evidenced by the negative rates globally.  
Even the US, at 2% is still technically a negative real yield.  That implies these currencies arent worth anything, as these countries are willing to PAY someone to hold the cash.
@_date: 2019-08-12 03:48:44
However, if the US accepts crypto, the debt can still be there while the base (crypto) remains unchanged.
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:44:53
Banks dont really pay interest anymore.  At least in Western civilization anyways.
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:31:10
Was more of a joke that Canada no longer has any gold in reserve...
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:42:53
We live in a deflationary world with an inflationary currency.  Guess which one is most likely to break first?
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:07:29
Well, they have to comply with lots of laws and regulations which cost money.  Thus, their spreads are fair (for most machines).
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:02:55
Care to point out  single EU country that accepts 1M illegals per year?
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:47:51
If prices fall over time, this leads to a race to the bottom in prices.  This is why we are currently experiencing a currency war, and why countries are weakening their currencies on purpose.
It will not end well.
@_date: 2019-10-28 15:28:41
Those countries are not Socialist.  Even they have made that very clear.
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:19:01
Once met a dude at a festival with an entire altoids tin filled with the stuff.
Weird weekend.
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:25:33
BTC hasnt been around during a US market crash.  We will have to wait and see.
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:56:12
Your point?
Trump got them to increase their spending to match what they already promised.
Quit rolling over.
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:20:56
Fun fact:  If you reduce military spending to $0, you still couldn't pay for M4A without raising taxes.
You're a joke and so is your post.
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:30:46
Bless your heart.  I love when I read other people type/say this.
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:07:10
I fully agree with you mate.  I'm quite "heavy" in crypto.  I'm hoping for the best :)
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:52:57
I'm well aware of that.  My point still stands.
@_date: 2019-04-14 18:51:56
Welcome to being an adult.  Please make any and all decisions carefully, as you are not a child and no cares.

You only get 2% back on your cc purchase, because banks arent paying interest on accounts.
@_date: 2019-09-07 22:17:39
Well, at least we agree that the issue behind climate change is too many people, and not necessarily the burning of fossil fuels.

I was banned because of the volume of coins/$ I was purchasing and immediately removing from exchanges.
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:51:25
It is!  They will be moving all of their miners to thermal plants shortly.  Expect a large decrease in hashrate soon.
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:17:58
I dont have a choice, as I've been banned from US exchanges.
So....I will gladly pay the 8% fee.
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:52:26
There was post on reddit a couple weeks ago.  He said government forces them to move when the wet season ends.
Here's a different article talking about the subject.
@_date: 2019-09-01 20:36:56
Thank you for saying this.  With the current hashrate/miner, they're making some good cash right now.
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:00:14
Hashrate dropped because Chinese miners have to move their equipment to thermal plants and off hydro.
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:53:27
Look back at the last 2 years.  Hashrate always drops around the same time by a large amount, then resumes.
@_date: 2019-09-08 00:52:24
Eh, if enough people believe in it, or if people that program algos to include TA.....self fulfilling prophecy me thinks.
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:57:05
Hash rate is expected to drop soon, as Chinese government forces miners to move from hydro to thermal power after the wet season.  Should last a couple weeks.
@_date: 2019-09-07 17:43:38
Better stock up on guns then, eh?
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:58:55
Some Chinese dude made a post the other day about it.  If you look back at prior years, the hashrate always drops in September, then starts to rise again a couple weeks later.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:00:13
Go buy 1 share in an ETF.  Try to cash out in the underlying.  Let me know how it goes.
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:39:42
Only in a basic residential account, not a business account I presume.
I was unable to find a single major or community bank in my area that would let me open a business account that would have been crypto related.
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:13:20
I would rather to own the shares myself.  ETFs are derivatives, and unless you're a whale, you have no claim to the underlying.
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:11:16
Pretty certain candy bars in a vending machine cost more than $1....

I've got $5k on hand if it does.  Spent a lot over winter, but would love another dip.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:30:09
National residential average is 12 cents.  6 cents is really low, and you should be happy.
@_date: 2019-05-05 23:22:52
I do.  It did not make any difference.

Lots of hydro in the US.  Old nuclear plants that are already paid for and some coal remaining. 
I pay 5 cents kWh, 60% nuclear 40% coal.
