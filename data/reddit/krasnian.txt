I'm pretty sure it's bots doing it.

Square payments are integrating bitcoin as a payment method. This makes it extremely easy for all small businesses to adopt BTC as a form of payment

In all honesty, I cashed out yesterday at 11.5k and woke up this morning regretting that decision but I have still profited the past few days. I'm only shorting BTC so I can increase my coins in an alt coin project I have been following for a while. While I like BTC its never going to replace fiat due to its instability. At the moment if I have $1 and want to buy an apple for example I know that in a months time Ill still be able to buy an apple for $1 whereas with Btc you might think you would be able to buy an apple in a month with budgeting etc but its that volatile more than likely you will only be able to afford a slice. People cant operate like that with mouths to feed and bills to pay. All bitcoin is doing is creating a massive re distribution of wealth and it isn't being redistributed to the little guys either.

Same, but its the big players and financial institutions manipulating the market that are accumulating the most wealth and its not from each other. BTC to them is just another market they can exploit which isn't what the movement is about.

Yeah its not an original idea. I remember seeing it about that time because we talked about it in the ltc forums and how cool it would be to do something similiar. I remember at the time instead of buying gifts I was buying people ltc paper wallets with 10 coins in each.

Hahaha yeah when everyone dumps their altcoins lol

Well that makes no sense. If no one trades and hodls how is the price meant to increase? Maybe we should all just hodl and allow the onstitutions to manipulate the price.

Lol, 100%

I was thinking the other day how cool it would be to have gold bullion BTC coins that had a gold value and a btc value ie using gold bullion instead of a paper wallet

You don't mine a bitcoin you mine a block. The current reward is 12.5 btc. You might strike it rich and mine a block solo but its very unlikely. If you join a pool you have more chance of being rewarded and your shares in the mined coins depend on your hashing power and how much you contribute. Checkout the btc mining calculators

Yeah someone posted a transaction last night that went to coinbase and it was 8000 BTC
@_date: 2019-06-15 01:31:13
Yeah it's all the trading bots being triggered.

If he was that good at investing he wouldn't be writing dumbass articles. He mentions Facebook and Libra coin and the only reason its being created is to benefit FB bottom line. I guess this chump thinks he smarter than everone else involved with the project

With anything IT related its best to use notepad with anything that requires an explicit input, using word can sometimes add a space after the text and same goes for stuff copied from the web. Copy into notepad, verify the text then copy to wherever you want

We were using paypal back in 2012 for buying and selling crypto, I was involved with LTC a fair bit back then but we used to use admins on litecointalk to escrow, then a few escrow services came online. I haven't had a need for quite a while but id imagine there would be services available

Never going to happen. People are too greedy and the market is manipulated too much
