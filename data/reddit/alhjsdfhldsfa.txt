Well I begged him in early 2017 and he ignored me but it's become obvious this is the future of money, even he agrees, and given how low of a risk it is as long as you hold and do not panic sell, there's no way to lose if you can wait out maximum of one halving.

Over $5k profit in 8 hours off 100k is retarded? Soon to be 10x that. Yeah, really retarded. I could literally set a breakeven stop(entry 9320) and be freerolling potentially to 7 figures. One lightning network is out and BTC can actually become the global currency, and I got my family in at 1/10th that price, that's retarded. Yep.

Speculative to some, but if you actually understand the tech, FIAT is the speculative asset that you should be concerned about.

After 2 years of trying I finally convinced my father to take out a 100k loan to all in crypto. It's pretty evident this is going to be well over 50k in the next 2-3 years, I told him he can easily take out 100k when it doubles, which seems basically guaranteed in the next few months. Then freeroll it and pay off the loan. I just wish we did it when we were sub 4k, but at least we now have confirmation of this multi year bullrun. I doubt we see sub 7k ever again, and even if we do, he said he can get another 50k in. Plan is to use the profits to buy a second house in 2021 ish. I feel bad for not getting him in at the bottom but he was hesistant and thought it was going to zero. The good news is he agreed to give me 20% of the profits once we break 500k on the account. It's hilarious watching people sit on the sidelines waiting after seeing what bitcoin has done in every cycle once we broke out. Only question is do we take profit at 50k or not. I feel like it will be a potentially big mistake if we actually get into the mid 6 figure range. I told him not to take a penny out more than he invests + the second home(prob 200kish). If the world economy keeps going like it is we might honestly see 7 figure btc by the next(2024) halving. Absolute worse case and we are in the 10k range in a few years. I don't see how this can possibly lose with the mining algo. The only people betting against bitcoin don't understand it. Everyone who understands the underlying tech is all in and on leverage, as they should be. I wouldn't be shocked if buying in here is like getting in in 2012 in the next few years. The same idiots who wouldn't buy at $30 and said they told you so when it dumped are saying to sell here. Institutions accumulated and they don't sell for small gains. They are looking for 10x minimum, and I don't even see them selling most coins before bitcoin becomes the world reserve.
