looks to be at the same price as it was yesterday when I checked $91, not noticed any masive drops the last few days, seems to be floating around $100.

very true, I don't have a lot tied up in the system right now, so risk for me is minimal, I do find it interesting to watch the price rocket up the way it has over the last couple of months. I think it was at $40 or so when I brought in. 
man, I do wish I would have shoveled some more cash at this a few weeks back. Kinda makes me wonder where the ex price is heading.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:56:50
sad to say, but it's definitely heading that way, down to $78 :\

I applaud this attitude! what a stud. I hope it pans out ok for him and it just some little pissant with no ability to carry out the attack.

I'm with you man, I would have transfered all the cash out and been done with it. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:58:31
wow, just noticed the guys over at coinbase have added a warning on their transfers page:
"Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Thursday Apr 11, 2013 at 12:56PM PDT after your funds have arrived."
can't say I blame them really, the fluctuations in the market must be playing havoc with their service.

and that's probably the exact reason none of us trying to use the web site are ever able to buy BTC, LOL.
note to self: start looking into the API.

^ YES! lol, honestly though that, technically, isn't my problem, as much as the "transfer from your US bank account" is nice, I've been using coinbase for the last 2 months and it's been nothing but hassle.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:22:08
harsh, but 100% accurate.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:54:47
DUDE, SAME HERE! I emailed them, and was like "well how do I cancel if the market goes to shit and I don't like the BTC value I'm gonna get?" their response was "use the cancel button" me: ermm, what cancel button is that then? there isn't one on the transaction page?
still waiting for a response now. IDK what to do BTC is supposed to be here wednesday, I agreed for market value when the money clears, which looks to a good trade, but still. 
I think I'm done with CB, they take way too long to get their shit in gear, way too many problems with the service so far.

I'd consult the minority report.

I need ti change my underwear. :\ LOL
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:53:46
yeah, it's annoying, they've added the disclaimer saying if you buy now, your transaction will only be valued at the exchange rate 2 days from now- and at this rate, who fucking knows what that will be?
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:18:43
wow, that was embarrassing, what a retard.
