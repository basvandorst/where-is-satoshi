This shows westerners' addiction to the decimal system. There is nothing significant about 10. If you instead make a goal to invest a certain percent of your annual income based on your risk tolerance, you'll have both a budget and a goal. With the risk involved, investment should stop once the goal is met, unless you can justify the extra investment with recent events like a raise or positive crypto news

I did buy it for the tech though, why is that a meme. Thought process: this storage of value is an inspiration to young people and small companies to innovate. It only has to be the "oldest" and most popular to survive. As it survives, segwit like tech that integrates external services can add value/quality. When alts become service providers to the masses, it's current position as an exchange medium solidifies.. I guess my problem is that I can't predict the length of time that it will take for the difference in trust between ETH and BTC to become too small to matter
