No, that's the definition out of the dictionary: 


: to take (something that you are not supposed to have) without asking for permission
: to wrongly take and use (another person's idea, words, etc.)
Bitcoins are a form of money or monetary storage.  The action of the individual was no different than an individual seeing your debit card number and using that information to take money out of your bank account.  
It's still stealing.  By definition, both legal, and dictionary based.  The bitcoin wasn't "found."  The code was literally in the hands of the owner.

According to your logic, if I dropped my car keys, and someone else picked them up and started driving my car, that would be perfectly legal.  Taking something that you are not explicitly given permission to use is stealing.  If you forget to lock the door to your hose and someone decided to go in there and use your stuff, that's not legal.  It's trespassing.
Or software is open source, right?  So if I create an exploit and use that to take over your computer and use it to send spam, that's okay, right.  Because the source code was public.
Compromised information is just that.  It's not given away.  If that's your logic, then there is nothing wrong with what the NSA is doing if they decide to track stuff that you put out on the internet.

No, this is more akin to seeing someone's wallet sticking out of their back pocket and taking it because it's easily accessible.  A theft still occurred, it's just that the owner decided not to pursue.

So, according to your logic, a bitcoin is a thing that can function as money (which is simply a thing that functions in place of a tradeable  physical good), however, a debit card is not, and any connection between the two is bullshit.
Then you jump off into the idea of losing children for some reason.


Kind of like your debit card number.

They do, it's just that it's not mainstream news usually:
