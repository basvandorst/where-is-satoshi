"It's not like credit cards, it's more like 'digital cash,' so when I send you some amount of bitcoin, it's not just that your account gets credited, it's that those bitcoins 'move' and get assigned to your 'wallet,' and now they're gone from mine."

I think you're correct about hippies in the broadest, crudest sense, but another thing to realize is that a college education was a) much less "trade school" oriented than getting your B.A. is now and b) much more accessible to the middle class, which was also much larger. I mean, come on, I've lived in Berkeley, I know plenty of former VW bus-driving baby boomers who've traded it in for a hybrid SUV and live in the hills while recycling and composting all their bioplastics and make six figures doing yoga retreats for Fortune 500 companies and have convinced themselves that Unilever-owned Ben-&amp;-Jerry's-style capitalism will save the world, but, to point at some more famous examples, Jerry Garcia grew up in the Excelsior, Janis Joplin was from some shitty oil town, and there are plenty of '60s burnouts who've never transcended their obviously-white-trash roots, and I'm sure they opposed the war just as vehemently, if less informedly and effectively than their college-educated brethren. I think there are plenty of valid criticisms you can level at cryptoanarchism, but conflating them with the failings of the '60s counterculture is just lazy.

Thanks for explaining my beliefs to me without knowing anything about me, though.


If you want to rephrase what I said for fifth graders feel free; I was genuinely at a loss for any way to express it more directly and succinctly.
^(Not that I think it will help my case, but I hate academic jargon, too.)


[Egalitarianism]( is already a thing. I would say feminism is subsumed by it, but YMMV. If you wanna coin another, more inclusive name for the movement that won't hurt men's feels quite so much; go right ahead, I genuinely wish you luck.
Maybe it is a "bad name." But it's the one that's stuck over the past ~50-100 years, and so claiming that it's called the wrong thing, and therefore couldn't *possibly* be egalitarian because of a certain label, is ridiculous.  
My point, just to spell it out, was, Does it really seem so odd that a movement focused on equality *between genders* (note the particular emphasis of this specific egalitarian movement) should get a name based on its founding *by and for the group unquestionably at the receiving end of almost all gender-discrimination* at the time?
But I guess you're going to tell me men still didn't have equal custody rights, therefore the suffragettes should have picked a less alienating word?
Some other fun words that have been hijacked by a whole range of folks: *Christian*, *anarchist*, *liberal*, *conservative*, *artisan*,  *engineer*, *patriot*, *sustainable*, *underground*, *terrorist*, *extreme*... But, y' know, whaddaya gunna do?
Obviously those words have *meaning*, but their usage has become so broad as to be fairly unhelpful without any further qualification.


Arguably pointing that out was redundant, but I merely wanted to emphasize those characteristics of "interpretation." So you're agreeing that calling a supposition about the motivations of others "factually correct," which was the issue in contention here, is, if not batshit insane, at least faulty logic.

No... what?


Unless I espoused the "feminist belief" upthread that "words have no meaning" that I missed... you were the one postulating on what you think I think, before I've said anything, as if it's relevant.


Right, I do appear to be the only one who noticed that hypotheticals cannot be "factually correct," so I pointed that out.
But instead you want to yell at me about the perceived faults of feminism (?).


But the initial assertion (not by you) seemed to be that anything called "feminism" ipso facto cannot be an egalitarian movement, or that the historical circumstance of its naming reveals its unegalitarian nature.

You hit on it; the reason Waco and the MOVE firebombing happened with impunity is... no one really gives a shit. Of course, power does what it can to maintin its power, but ostensible democracies have a leg up - it's a lot tougher for the State to use violence against its own citizens when they pay lip service to the rule of law. Yeah, the US government does some pretty horrible shit, but let's be sparing with the hyperbole - Obama is not Pinochet. Maybe no atrocity would bother them too much, but possibly the main criterion is but whether they can get away with it; if they get caught, that threatens their power, too.
As Ralph Nader says, daily democracy requires daily participation. But who wants to study the voter guide or write a letter to the editor when there's something good on? When it's "them," most people don't care; by the time they realize they're them too, it's often too late.

"I want to buy bitcoin, but $250 for one? It's just too expensive!"
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:02:37
Well, my experience differs. Especially when the climbing price of bitcoin brought it mainstream media coverage, those numbers scared off a lot of n00bs and casual investors. My anecdotal data: I talked to several people who were interested, but put off by the price, because they didn't realize that they could buy less than one bitcoin.
This is not an unreasonable assumption on its face. Even though there's no reason the American dollar can't be divided into ha'pence, and people deal with quantities of 9₥ every time they fill their petrol tank, most people's day-to-day experience of money reflects seemingly-indivisible units of currency represented by *coins*. It's difficult for the average consumer to intuitively grok - many people's initial objection to eliminating the cent coin is that they don't want prices to change (not understanding that *prices* could end in .03 even if that amount is smaller than the lowest denomination). The satoshi, though hypothetically divisible, is practially the smallest unit of currency. Why would people assume there's anything smaller than a single "coin?"

As a language nerd I'd be deeply concerned about what a sudden influx of English-speakers to the island would do to the viability of Niuean.

It's clear OP had tongue firmly in cheek but just to play devil's advocate, as a vendor who accepts bitcoin, I prefer being able to sell my wares/services without having to price them in a national currency or write a script that constantly updates BTC, and I enjoy being paid in bitcoin. I hodl a bit of it, yes, but also seek to do business with as many other bit- and dogecoin-accepting companies as I can. Bitcoin fascinates me as the currency of the Internet, that facilitates transactions with other people around the world, not as some Gordon Gekko get-rich-quick scheme.
