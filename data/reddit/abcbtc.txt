Lots of people you know think Bitcoin is physical gold? Please tell me you're kidding?

I'm struggling to comprehend how they missed the most obvious and primary attribute of Bitcoin. Honestly, some people...

This is absolute nonsense.

I'm running my node on a VPS with plenty of resources, for $4 per month...

This might help (I've not tested:

Limit I think is 4 or 5TB per month &amp; I'm paying $49 per year (admittedly it was on offer) I think it is with hudsonvalleyhost. Found via lowendbox.com

I agree with Mobtrerifjf, your replies lack substance and contribute no value to the debate, instead you attack the person you're debating with.

Those questions do not matter to me any more than who Satoshi Nakamoto is. The code is public.

Forced? Bitcoin Cash wouldn't exist if nobody was interested. There wouldn't be a market if nobody wanted it. Nobody has been forced to do anything, if anything a fork by definition is never forced. Exchanges would not be in business long if they chose to play policitical games instead of actually being an  **exchange**.


Easier said than done. Where have we been the past 3 years?


Amen to that!

Don't forget;
- Fee for opening channel
- Fee for closure
- Requires sender, receiver &amp; all hubs in-between to be ONLINE at the time of transfer
- What happens when channels are closed, but there is not enough block space? It won't be pretty

Running since 25th July but vnstat only installed on 5th Aug. Apologies for huge image! No connection limit configured
Edit: currently 117 established &amp; 17 listening connections

There are groups of devs, please do some research... Most welcome to ask about anything on the btc sub - there are valid "historical reasons" (and little proof) for this hard fork from both sides, best bet is to inform yourself of either's arguments

How about actually sharing some insight in to your twisted mentality instead of this mindless drivel you posted. Caps accentuated laughs on the internet - c'mon let's hear it you're getting me all excited too now!
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:56:17
Accusations without proof. Your outlook couldn't get more twisted.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:24:56
agree with scbill66 - attack by definition is not the correct term
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:18:14
op-return doesn't understand Bitcoin, forking, or contention
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:20:21
This is how Bitcoin is supposed to work. Hard fork leaves the network if you want to join them do, or don't? What are you so concerned about really? You even get coins equivalent to the BTC you already hold so....?
