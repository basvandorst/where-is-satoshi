How can you just not care that this guy is misleading loads of new comers? You think BCH is the better coin, ok no problem... but this marketing strategy is **detrimental** to BCH, people aren't going to get to find out about why BCH is better because they'll associate it with this scam artist and instantly get turned off. Surely you must understand that people tend not to dig deeper with something if they think they are being mislead??

get the fuck off Reddit mate, you genuinely believe we make up a majority when compared to people who use the banking system for every important aspect of their lives?
I get it that maybe even in your local community it may seem like no one trusts the banks, but yet they still use them, a lot.

Huh, do you have a source for this? Because as I understand it from having read numerous opt out policies (Thanks to GDPR) Marketing agencies simply place an opt-out cookie in your browser, which as I understood to mean, please correct me if I'm wrong, that when they read the cookies to figure out what kind of targeted ad to serve me they simply get a "no info" type return and serve something corresponding to the websites usual/target demographics?
At what point would the infrastructure need to be revamped? it seems to me they just need to add a new cookie policy for that GDPR update in a probably already existing table?


It's not about whether they are harmless or not, it's about having the freedom to say "No, you can't use my proprietary data". I don't trust multiple agencies to handle my personal data in a safe or respectable manner because they have given me numerous reasons not too over the past years, in my opinion and since I maintain ownership of that data theoretically, I'm simply exercising my rights in a nice, standardized manner rather than the hectic mess of individual opt-outs it was before. Just as it's a private websites right to deny me access based upon that (just as it has been for websites that use anti ad-block technology)
But here's the real kicker, GDPR made me turn off my ad-block. I lost my reason to use it and can *actually* start supporting the web masters and content creators that I love without worry. Sounds like a good deal all round to me, no?

Shit that's so much more impressive than some dude who just bought at $30 and HODL'd...

What do you base that on?

Facts are usually accompanied by a source?

Always a great basis for sound, rational economic decisions.

They figured out a way to cash in on not one, not two, not three but four hot trends right now. (BTC, Blockchain, Solar power, economic development in middle America) with low risks (real estate was a donation. They buy the infrastructure and rent out to mining firms bypassing the risk with price fluctuations of BTC.) 
Plus as they said, If Cryptos fail they still have a low cost data center. If data centers aren't a thing anymore (wut?) the state is legally obligated to buy the solar energy generated.
What's the virtue here? Smart money?

Yep and divide by 0 to get hash...

Jeez.. next you're gonna tell me my Bananocoin is useless too...
@_date: 2018-07-04 06:43:08
Yeah nice one India, ban cryptos cause "muh people don't understand technology. Muh people are too technologically illiterate"
In the meantime there are literally mobs forming due to rumours on whatsapp, lynching people who look different because apparently "They're child snatchers"
India's response? "BTC is dangerous for our people"... Fuck this.
just so you know I'm not talking out of my ass:

I'm all for fair and honest criticism, but I've never heard that he's *selling* mosquito nets... The campaign against malaria led by their foundation has changed countless lives in Africa, saying otherwise is disingenuous and taints the rest of your (good) point... Unless you have a source for that? In which case I'd love to see it.

Totally agree. Adoption is key to success, not the other way around.

Are you mad that someone is poorer than you and EUR1500 is not a small amount for them?
Cause that's how your coming across right now, it's not a great look though.

Taking that as a yes, very very mad.

It's almost as if it's all FUD anyways and we shouldn't give a fuck what Mr. Gates thinks either way.
