What is your conclusion based on?

Divide and conquer

That's pretty much every person in the world.

Don't get if OP is sarcastic or not, you are trying to send a huge transaction, of course it will cost.

This is why I got into bitcoin in the first place. With bitcoin there is no wars, no one is going to spend their own wealth to kill other humans, if it is not for a true just cause. With bitcoin there is no stealing other peoples wealth by printing your own filthy fiat currency. With bitcoin there is no constructed boom and bust cycles to cleanse out the wealth of the people. Cryptoanarchy is an inevitability, bring it on! let's kill these filthy thieving rats with true economics.

I stopped here, the person making this comment has a totally bizarre idea of what economy is. If he builds further on this logic the outcome can only be false.

There will never be any split, because if bitcoin splits bitcoin is dead.
I will not use any retarded crypto that has split. If it split, how do I know it will not split again? and again? and again? 
This divide and conquer scheme that is going on is obvious, anyone pushing for BU or UASF are helping with the split. The best thing is to ignore both sides, UASF will be a failure.

I was just thinking about that. Why was these other variables removed?

Those things:




Is there any person in the world that don't have these things? Is there actually people out there with no idea of what they are doing and no experience of any kind? I take it you don't include people like newborns and the severely mentally handicapped?
What is a 'moon kid'?
