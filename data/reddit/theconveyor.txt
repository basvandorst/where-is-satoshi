Too bad 99.99% of the people missed the 600% gains ��. And yes I was one of them, I sold $15 worth of BTC for a shitty eBook on Hackforums back in 2010 ��

I remember my uncle flew with $75k once. He split up the money and placed them inside pockets of clothing. He had bank receipts and even a statement from his bank claiming why he withdrew the money and signed off by the bank manager. He was investing in property in a foreign country (his home country). I always thought it was weird how he hid the money even when he had proof. And this is exactly the reason he did that...
This was 7 years ago btw. I truly hope this man gets his money back. It's just shameful the things the government does now.

There is a limit of having undeclared money. Green card holders and non residents can carry up to 5k and US Citizens can carry 10k without having to declare they have it. Anything over and you must report it. That's where the confusion is.

Im not sure about a link but I've had about 16-20 family members immigrate to the US since 2013 and when they traveled back to their country to visit they mentioned how they cant carry over 5k. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:16:17
Well said. That guy just wants to be spoon fed lmao. It's because of poorly educated CBP officers like him people have to suffer and lose their shit all the time. If he was the least bit competent he would know about these limits. You mentioned China, my family is from India and they have the same limits as the Chinese. That's 2 major countries whose limits this CBP officer did not know. How can he be expected to do his job properly lmfao

Holy shit I remember a couple weeks ago 1 usd was like 40k bolivars and I thought they was crazy but 2 million now? 
@_date: 2018-06-03 15:24:32
Damn dude get some friends and go out. If you have even a slightly below average brain you should be able to understood my point despite a small grammar mistake. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:12:56
It's information I got in person at the airport. Not something I read online, can you read what I wrote?
I had relatives take money and airport authorities informed them because they are green card holders their maximum amount they can carry without declaring is $5k. 
If you are really interested in finding it online try a google search or call up a airport and get your answers.

I wouldnt trust yahoo to operate anything related to money. They got hacked multiple times and didnt even bother to inform the public. I became an identity theft victim because of yahoo and boy was it a hassle to go through that. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:08:46
No it's not allowed. I know this because my friend was a personal victim. Coinbase pulled out $1000 from his account, when he checked his order history somehow a order for $1000 of btc was placed from his account. He got mad and contacted coinbase and all they told him was that he had 20 seconds to cancel when an order was placed. Of course since he never placed an order to begin with he wouldn't know. 
He went to his bank and filed a chargeback and got his money back. Apparently it wasnt just him but many people complained for something similar to the same bank. He got his money back and coinbase never took back the bitcoin. So after waiting 3 months he simply transferred out to a different exchange and sold it. He made a shit ton of profit as it happened in September and he sold in November of 2017
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:24:25
That's true. But also more susceptible to chargebacks plus the transaction fees. It may seem irrelevant but it adds up. $100k in sales on Discover card, theres roughly a 6% fee on that so you just lost $6000 easily
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:52:33
Nice. It's a different entity? 
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:51:01
Oh my fault, I heard it was 6% from somewhere. But yeah if it's 2.3 then AMEX would be the highest with 3.5%
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:09:40
It's like a world of Inception if the Yahoo name is number 1 somewhere lol. Makes sense though. Thanks for the info!

Damn haha, everybody being a millionaire is funny. To the people who wouldn't know they would think Romanja is the richest country
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:49:02
Interesting. Never heard of something like that before. Hope everything is works out for you and you can purchase crypto!
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:03:00
Yse TD bank. That's what I used and I'm in the US. TD is a canadian bank and they have no limit when purchasing crypto
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:15:38
Companies don't invest into bitcoin, people do. You are basically saying company A bought stocks of company B and company A is selling to show a loss. I'm sure shareholders would not want the company to invest into shares of another company. 
If people wanted to show a loss they would've sold by December 31st but at that point many people were well above 100-300% gains. The crash just happened this year.
But anyways, if for some bizarre reason you are current I'll give up on humanity lmao
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:01:52
Isn't the current system something like this:
Buy $100k worth of BTC. Value drops to $10k. Sell the $10k. Get taxed in the $10k? 
If this is the case then it's ridiculous, someone just took a hit of 90k and he still pays tax? 
Correct me if I'm wrong but I heard this from a few people. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:33:14
Oh wow you that's crazy. I just did a $20000 wire transfer into coinbase without any issues. Is it like a Canadian law that restricts crypto purchases for banks?
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:07:30
Kinda late to the game
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:31:59
They probably at a point where they need to print 50,000 or 100,000 bills lol
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:51:25
No its not impossible. The bank tracked down the money from the merchant (coinbase) and got the money back and refunded it to my friend. A wire transfer is irreversible if the merchant doesnt cooperate and has a different bank.

I used to be a active member on hackforums.net
It's well known for people selling "eBooks" to be a online entrepreneur. I remember I bought some eBook for like $15 in late 2010. The user had a thing where it was a money back guarantee, I paid with PayPal and wanted a refund because it was just a drop shipping method. The user didnt have PayPal money but offered me BTC. Back then it was worth like $0.25 a bitcoin so I had roughly 60 btc. I have about 1/3 of that today which is roughly 160k. Not a lot but wish I kept it all or sold during the december ATH ��
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:11:02
It's fine if they block credit card transactions cause thats the banks money. But debit card links directly to your own money so why block that? If the user does get scammed then they can complain all they want but nothing will happen cause the bank has no control over the users funds. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:48:02
Lol yeah. You get the point ��
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:34:56
I buy $250 worth weekly. It's not much but I try to purchase during the hard dips whenever possible. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:16:20
Nah. The real estate market has gone through so much inflation. For the average Joe they can work all their life and not have enough money to own their own place. Lots of people immigrated out and send money back to India and invest in property. For the local public there it's hell.
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:18:32
Cuban just mad there's going to be more rich people in the world.

India pays low salary. Engineers from India are trying to move out of the country to get higher wages. The standard of living is very low in India. A McDonalds worker in the USA would typically make around or more money than a software engineer in India. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:37:06
It could also be the other way around. The engineers don't care enough about crypto and are focused on other technologies because they think they have a more prominent career ahead. 
But yes, in my opinion I think crypto is rising rapidly. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:00:36
He's just saying the exchange rate, he never said about selling Btc to bolivars. Also if you do like in Venezuela you need bolivar to buy stuff to survive so I guess the country's residents? 
@_date: 2018-04-08 03:53:21
Damn I'm impressed. There's not a lot of honest people who will report income when they use crypto as a payment method lol. I know 2 business owners who own convenient stores and do about ~$800 in profit monthly but they never report that. Anyways let's answer your question. 
But for book keeping just write down the exchange rate at the time of purchase and the amount of BTC you got. Of course what is essential is when you report the income and if BTC has risen in price you will also pay taxes on capital gains ((new btc price - old btc price) * btc owned).
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:09:17
Yeah but banks have a fraud department and everything. They have employees in that sector who are paid to deal with them. I had a fraud claim for a $40 jacket and it took me 3 months to get my money back, very slow process. 
I do agree with not using your debit card. I was a victim of a $11,500 loss on Alibaba, I learned my lesson the hard way lol. My bank legit said they can't do anything because it was a debit card transaction, if it was credit they can easily recover the funds.
