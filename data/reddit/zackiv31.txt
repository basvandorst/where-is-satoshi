It's not when a credit card purchase is instant and an ACH purchase takes ~10 days.  If you're planning on flipping anything in the short term for a quick profit, the "math" doesn't matter.  You're argument only works for holding, OP is talking about actively trading.

Stellar does 1000 operations a second, on the chain.  So no it wouldn't have the same congestion issues of bitcoin if all volume moved today, it would be considerably faster (and cheaper).

But it's not a fantasy.  Any solution will eventually run into *some* scaling solutions, but their exists solutions in other cryptos *today* that bitcoin can't compete with.  Stripe is one of those that would benefit greatly from the speed and cost of Stellar.

They updated it to say that the *timeline* is not accurate, meaning it has been updated.  It still reads as if the rest of the FAQ is still factual.
They don't need to be fortune tellers to give people forked coins, they hold the keys so they can grant the fork to their customers.

I see a lot of people in here saying if u hold BTC on coinbase that you will not automatically get B2X (if that fork happens).  According to the older [FAQ]( that is incorrect:

Consider me one of the few who is transferring BTC to gox to cash out USD.  It's not easy, but it can be done.
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:03:18
I got USD to the USA in Dec.  I'm getting another batch this week.  If you want your money out there are ways.

What's that screenshot from?

Could you explain this?  How would you get people paid back 100% of their original BTC when 400k were stolen?
Are you thinking of reviving the company?  I'm not sure if that would be in the creditors best interest.

And yet I'm not in this leak at all... and I was in the original one.  Is this not the full dump?

This is an important point.  Also, isn't holding fiat in mtgox safer than holding BTC in it?  If gox ever did get hacked again, there is an exact amount of money that was in my account, much like a back account.  Now it's not FDIC insured or anything, but BTC can be swooped up and out without anything to do to rectify it.

Can we confirm the binaries released are equivalent to the source code released on github?  I don't compile for OSX or Windows... but that project doesn't seem to have any tools/MakeFiles to be able to do any of that.  Why aren't those in the source?
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:35:08
Depends on the action that day.  Last night, with the bid wall... I just had to leave it all in BTC.
That said... I wrote a program to alert me when the price changes too much, or gox lag &gt;60 seconds... needless to say I only got 3 hours of sleep last night.
I haven't seen the sun in days.

I know people aren't a big fan of mtgox, but I've been using this exact feature with them for about a year now.  A simple email to support and you can set whatever daily BTC/Fiat limits you want.

Are you saying this is something that can currently be requested (the delay until processed)?  This would be even better news.
EDIT: Your post reads like a a suggestion for better security.  I definitely agree with you, but my PSA is something that can be down **now** with MtGox for even better security.

The problem with the theory in this case, is that 20k BTC's were dropped to get the price up from $66.  It was at this point, that the wall was put into place.  Doesn't quite make sense for them to drop &gt;$1M if they didn't intend/expect it to keep rising.
Then again, maybe he was just bored with the stagnation in the 60's.

Where does the data come from?  It seems to be delayed by quite a bit.  Looking for USD from MTGOX.
@_date: 2013-03-07 06:05:21
May I suggest some type of "price" or "range" in addition to quantity.  I wouldn't want a buy order through coinbase to bring me the same misery that a "market" order does on mtgox (executing at whatever price it pleases whenever it pleases)
If the sale is not within the range, return an error with the current rate so we can abort or resubmit another order.

Wait... so you're telling me this mysterious satoshi group person thing has full access to all of bitcoin and can send messages onto the bitcoin network whenver he/she/they pleases?  So it's like TuPac coming back?

Just wanted to say I'm in the exact same position as you.  I've setup my own alerting system, to detect and monitor these flash crashes in as close to real time as possible.  We're the new breed of bitcoin day traders who see the value in the currency, but also the value in being able to flip them at a moments notice to fiat and back to increase our holdings.  I personally end up holding fiat more than I would like, but its also a sense of security against anything bad that could happen with my money being in mtgox.
I think there's a split in here and  those who got in early and are comfortable not worry about the price of BTC, and those of us buying at 10x what they bought in at and wanting to protect our investment if at all possible.  I'd rather have 2x my BTC tomorrow than I did today (if it was only that easy).

I posted this 6 months ago, but it's a good reminder.  If you're on Mt.Gox, request them to LOWER your BTC withdrawal limits.  This way, you'll only ever have the chance to lose more than this amount within 24 hours. Here's how: 
Just something else to do on top of 2FA.
