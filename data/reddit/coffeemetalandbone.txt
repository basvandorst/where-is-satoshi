Yeah except the fact that someone owns a million BTC. The more it's worth, the more power they get.

Serious question, why is this a bad short term solution? I get LN is going to alleviate a lot of this *when it comes out* but until it does, what's the downside?

M'respectful response

Not a big drop for speculation. If the PBoC actually puts some policy behind it, losses could be way worse.

I'm just as excited as the next guy about the price jump, but why is this happening? What's causing it?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:01:05
How do you even prove something like this?
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:14:32
How did y'all get that expert flair? I want one, too!

@_date: 2018-07-16 10:53:53
Another one?
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:04:42
Why do we need two?

No no no. You hit your lawyer, ex up, and fuck the gym.

Instead of a social security number, you get a wallet ID. That's where they pay you, that's where they tax you from.

Can someone ELI5 how we went from a mempool of 200k to 10k in about 2 weeks?
