The ssl certificate for bitaddress has not been setup correctly, I have seen this myself. You're probably OK, but it's also possible your connection was intercepted when requesting the bitaddress page and it was replaced with a malicious copy.
You may want to retrieve the page from the github repo:

If you can remember the password, you don't need to print out the private key. The point is to regenerate it from your brain. I'm currently working on memorizing eight words I selected randomly from the dictionary as a password. If you're not somehow putting actual randomness into your password, brain wallets are a very bad idea. Even if you are, they're still probably a bad idea. I only plan to put a small amount in mine.

You can generate your own keys using bitcoin-qt. Put it on a USB stick and run it from a live CD without an Internet connection. Generate some keys, then use the console command dumpprivkey to view them. Write it down on paper yourself and you don't even need to trust that the printer isn't storing anything.

The naive suggestion by QuasiSteve of using a custom large dictionary to represent multiple bits in a word will likely result in many hard to pronounce words. The [PGP word list]( could be used to encode an address, but it looks like the result would be 20 words. Might still be easier than reading aloud the individual characters?
"one capital-jay lower-doubleyou capital-ess capital-ess lower-you lower-bee" (etcetera for 34 characters total.)
vs "reproduce solo stethoscope pheasant Wilmington scenic glossary" (etcetera for 20 words.)

Talk to an accountant. Since you're actively trading this will likely be taxed at your marginal rate.
