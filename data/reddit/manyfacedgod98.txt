Yeah I'm gonna send it over to Electrum. But do I choose two factor authentication of multi signature? What's the difference 
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:46:02
What's their multisig wallet? Computer DL?
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:54:19
Ehhhh honestly I don't think I'd want to do a local trader.

What happens if I buy less than that and it appreciates over the hypothetical 1000 threshold?
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:45:23
On iOS. So I gather I can get on Coinbase and then transfer to electrum?

I ran into an issue. It makes me take a picture of my ID but I haven't transferred my ID into the horizontal frame. I can't find a way around it through Coinbase 
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:27:44
Yeah I just did it. It's been pending for like 30 minutes. Is that typical or long?
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:44:31
So my move would be to, say, download Coinbase app, pay, and then transfer from app to offline wallet?

I'm only going pretty small right now just as I figure out what I'm doing. Eventually I'll want to figure out the cold storage. 
Who should I be buying from? Isn't buying from an app different than other buying?

What's aml/kcy?

This definitely sounds like the best route. How do I go about getting this multisig vault? Is that a program downloaded to my laptop?
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:40:11
Would appreciate any advice on how I should get started

But does that still apply if you make your purchase on Coinbase and immediately send to an offline wallet? (Breadwallet)
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:55:48
Bitcoin went up around $100 ish on the day of Brexit what hi talking about
@_date: 2016-07-11 12:59:14
Yes it did return to where it "was", but it still moved $100
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:34:39
Buy from Coinbase and send to breadwallet (both are iOS apps)
@_date: 2016-07-16 15:31:53
Very important question
@_date: 2016-07-13 06:02:09
So that means she doesn't?
@_date: 2016-07-14 05:31:12
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:19:06
What methods of purchase are available for these?
