I'll be doing that as soon as the Core client supports it in GUI. I'm a lazy bum that doesn't want to learn a few command line operations.

I do ...
... when my computer is on ....
... and I need to actually run Bitcoin Core to send or receive stuff from my wallet ...
... and I don't immediately close it due to the fact that Bitcoin Core consumes a lot of system resources even on my pretty top of the line desktop machine ...
... which is to say I run a full node maybe for a few minutes every now and again.
So yeah not really I guess.  I use Bitcoin Core as my main long term storage wallet simply because it has the full blockchain locally and thus is a first authority on what my balance is and whether transactions are confirmed etc. But I don't usually leave it running. Perhaps I should.

The water in Australian toilets doesn't actually 'turn' (US toilets use an entirely different mechanism and a lot more water to flush compared to elsewhere). But even if you put a US style toilet in Australia, no the hemisphere has nothing to do with it. The initial conditions (at a minute scale) and the shape of the bowl are what matters. The coriolis effect does exist but is only significant enough to matter at the large scale (like hurricanes etc.)

But the picture text is in English and I think all English speaking countries use the comma for thousands separator, don't they? US does, Canada does, Australia does, NZ does, pretty sure the UK does...
I was under the impression that using the dot for thousands separator was a continental European thing.

I don't really like this over mBTC/μBTC/satoshi, because 'bits' already means something else in computing unrelated to a currency. But some form of smaller 'standard' denomination will be needed in a future where a single bitcoin is worth an enormous amount, so if this ends up being it then that's better than nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:27:41
Cause there's no real alternative for those in the US that doesn't have significant downsides. Gemini is good but isn't available in some states (like mine). But GDAX (Coinbase) is the only place I know of that allows me completely free trading (using limit orders) and withdrawals.
They also allow free and instant transfer of mining proceeds from NiceHash, which works really well.
Some overseas exchanges are pretty good but obviously won't accept ACH transfers from US banks, so you'd have to fund via wire which is expensive.
Edit: limit orders, not market. Brain malfunction.

It totally is a bubble. This isn't to say it is useless or unworthy ... but it is a bubble.
Look at the dot com bubble in the 1990s. A period of thousands of little companies all vying to be the next big thing, stock prices going up 100-fold, valuations through the roof ... then a crash. Sound familiar? But no one took that to mean that the tech itself (internet) wasn't useful or valuable. Many companies went under but the Googles and the Paypals and the Amazons of the world survived.
I think the same thing will happen to crypto. The bubble will pop, and may pop and reform multiple times, but at the end of the day there'll be a few crypto coins that emerge the winners and will go on to be massively important in 21st century finance.

You're braver than I if you think we are just in a dip now rather than the beginning of another long 2014-2015 style long term flat line.
I mean you may well be right but that's a hell of a gamble.
In seriousness though give one of the major exchanges a call and go OTC. Wouldn't risk those kind of figures going through one of GDAX's "hey it might get here, eventually, maybe" wire transfers...

I mean, I knew jack squat about trading and the concepts of a market order and limit order took about 3 sentences to explain and are quite simple. I don't really see the problem with interfaces like Gemini (and GDAX) have.

Yeah and you know what? That's just fine. He'll tell you straight up never to invest in something you don't understand. That's why he's so successful. He doesn't just look at a chart going up and say "this seems good, let's buy it". He studies each company or commodity he buys, and the markets they operate in, deeply. There are other fish in the sea and it's not like crypto is the only place you can make money.
I read about bitcoin many years ago, barely after the whitepaper was released. I was tempted to get a few back then for mere cents (and in hindsight I obviously should have), but it was logistically more difficult then (no exchanges and mining software was in its infancy), and I stayed out until I was comfortable that I really understood the tech and its potential benefits. I missed out on profit no doubt but that's fine.

Just start signing up to as many as you're eligible to sign up for - it never hurts to have other options and fallbacks. Exchanges have downtime and glitches and sometimes prices are better on one or the other.

Where are you a tax resident and what is your citizenship? This matters because it determines which countries you have an obligation to file taxes in.
For instance if you are Indian, living in India, and you just happened to buy BTC while on a trip to the US, then it's only Indian taxes you need to worry about. But if you are American living in the US (and a US person for tax purposes) then you will owe US taxes on this. If you are American but living in India you will have to file in both countries but will get a tax credit on your US taxes for tax already paid to India (you won't get double taxed on the sale).
TLDR: We need to know your tax statuses in the two countries before we can answer this.

I use Bitcoin Core for my long term storage wallet so I ... occasionally ... run a full node when I need to do a transaction from that wallet.
After waiting 18 hours or whatever for the ledger to catch up/sync everything that’s happened since I last ran it that is.
Really I should just get a raspberry pi and run an always-on full node.

I've has no issues and I use two of the four big banks in Australia. Seems pretty anecdotal (but then, so is my post).
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:05:02
Jeez that seems high. I only buy ETFs rather than mutual funds but avoid anything over 0.5% MER typically unless there’s a really good reason (eg. they give exposure to an asset type I have no chance of ever holding myself). But for bitcoin, may as well just buy the actual bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:06:24
I have not yet encountered any problems moving money between Australian crypto exchanges and Australian banks. Can't say anything about transfers to foreign exchanges though.
Note that I use second tier Aussie banks though rather than one of the Big 4.

It's good to send money to other people and different countries quickly, I will say. Beats PayPal and traditional currency exchange services for that. Takes an hour or two and the necessary fee to get the transaction confirmed in a reasonable time is chump change compared to the spread currency exchange places charge.

Perhaps you will be in a higher marginal bracket next year, or something.

Not directly, no, but they do run NiceHash on their GPU. And NiceHash pays you in Bitcoin.

Interesting how much more volume there is in Australia than Canada, despite Canada having 50% larger population and otherwise being two economically very similar countries.
This is localbitcoins volume only mind you, so I suppose part of this could be better availability of online exchanges in CA than in AU?
@_date: 2019-08-12 07:58:38
Only if you sell (and profit), which is the same as for crypto. Or receive income (dividends, distributions).
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:17:55
What are you talking about? There’s no ongoing fee to simply hold a stock, bond, ETF etc. Hell there’s often not even any fee for trading them either (many brokers will give you x free trades or free trades for particular ETFs).
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:28:38
No Robinhood here either (Australia). But I’ve never heard of a broker charging ongoing fees. It must be a national (or EU) law there.

There’s no capital gains tax in NZ? That’s pretty sweet. Australia and the US give you a discounted capital gains rate for long term (over 1 year) holding, but you can’t beat 0%!
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:22:51
Oh interesting, fair enough. That’s not the case in most countries though.
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:34:13
Interesting. Given that most shares produce some dividend income, I wonder where that line is between “I’m buying this stock because it has a high dividend” vs. “I’m buying this stock because I think the price will appreciate ... but it also pays some dividends”. Especially since dividends paid out by a company essentially come ‘out of’ the stock price anyway (they are just choosing to pay it out to shareholders instead of reinvest it in the company). Seems like a kinda grey area. I also wonder how that would apply to things like ETFs which are a basket of different investments, some of which may be dividend- or income-focused and some of which may be capital growth focused.
In Australia and the US (the two countries I’m most familiar with paying taxes in), you pay either way:
Australia: full marginal rate for assets held less than a year, half marginal rate for assets held over a year.
US: full marginal rate for assets held less than a year, flat 15% for assets held over a year (for most people, a higher 20% rate applies to very wealthy people).
No consideration is given to intent or whether the asset also produced income for you, in either country.
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:18:48
Theoretically that’s true ... but most people aren’t top investors and most people don’t have the time or skill to do the requisite amount of research.

I think the growing consensus is that BTC is more for large transactions and long term store, not your everyday coffee buying. At least until everything and everyone implements lightning properly.

33 million millionaires globally sounds awfully low. Are they not including home equity in that figure or something? Or basing it on liquid assets rather than net work?
In some countries, $1 million isn’t too far off the median house price. The family home plus even relatively modest retirement savings alone would put many middle aged and older people in the developed world into “millionaire” status, even if most of that wealth is locked away in an illiquid form.
33 million globally just sounds wayyyyy too low. Some quick googling suggests there’s between 5-7 million millionaires in the US alone ... and it only has 4% of the world’s population.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:07:28
It says it's fine on the status page ... *but it lies*. The live data isn't updating and half the graphs don't load. It still technically functions mind you (in terms of placing orders).
@_date: 2019-06-17 22:15:13
This will almost certainly be true I think. Bitcoin will be the valuable, prestigious, rarely used currency for large transactions and long term storage. But other cryptos with better scaling for fast everyday transactions will complement it. Litecoin as one example (it’s effectively very similar to BTC just with 4 times more supply and 2.5 minute blocks rather than 10 minute), but there will probably be several.
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:49:43
What is Google?
@_date: 2019-02-05 09:21:06
Yeah this. It’s a tabloid, and even ignoring that I don’t know how one could call it Australia’s ‘main’ newspaper.
For starters, it’s only widely available in 3 states (VIC, TAS, ACT), and some areas of SA and southern NSW adjacent to the Victorian border.

- Robust and can be stored indefinitely without decaying, tarnishing or otherwise being eaten away (with the exception of some very specific solvents that can dissolve gold)
And most importantly:
- 8000 years precedent of it being immensely valued by humans, and being used as money, in virtually every culture
It is basically the only thing that you could get in a time machine with and travel to any point in humanity’s history with, and be very likely to be able to buy stuff with it.

I mean ... most advanced economies don’t use checks anymore for precisely this reason. They got rid of them here in the late 80s/early 90s. Interbank transfers are free and near-instant (5-10 mins typically).
I’ve lived in 6 countries including the US (where I am currently) and without exaggeration, the American banking system is 25 years behind the rest of the developed world.
@_date: 2019-02-07 20:47:52
Option 1 seems to be overly complicated...if I owe my friend a bit of money I just send it to his bank account from mine. It doesn’t require PayPal or anything like that. Here in Australia, it’s universal (works from any bank to any bank), free, and near-instant (within 10 minutes, day or night, 7 days a week).
And this isn’t new - the systems that allow you to do this have been around since at least the 90s (this is literally how I paid my friends back for dinner or whatever when I was a teenager in the 90s). No doubt this was written from an American perspective (hence the mention of PayPal), but the US is well known for having much more antiquated consumer banking than most of the rest of the world. I mean they still use cheques there, which no one else has used since like the 1980s...
To me, it’s cross-border transactions where crypto shines. It brings the ease that we’ve always had for domestic transactions, to international transactions. Near instant, no currency conversion hassle, and virtually no fees etc.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:29:28
Depends on the scale we’re talking about. You can walk through an airport with what looks like to the x-ray just a bit of spare change in your pocket, that’s actually tens of thousands of bucks worth of gold coin.
If you’re moving billions then sure. But for anyone outside the top 0.1%, all their lifetime wealth in gold would easily fit in a purse or similar sized bag.
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:37:11
Pretty much anything is a better alternative to international money transfer than things like Western Union.
XETrade, OFX, TransferWise all give you much better rates.
And yes, crypto, which depending on the exchanges you use to convert to and from fiat can be virtually free and near-instant.

They are in most developed countries, yes.

This ‘investigation’ is actually a Royal Commission. I’m not sure America has any real equivalent to Royal Commissions and the powers of investigations they have, based on a quick googling, but I’m no expert.
