The total supply of gold is already estimated for a long time though. Of course they can not determine it on the milligram, but they will not be far off. So in that respect is gold the same as btc imho.

I think this dip resembles the first "low" on the rsi,  so the one on the left of the circeled one.
 We also didn't meet a huge wall of support, but just exhaustion of shorters and sellers.
 I will say that I can possibily be just as wrong as everybody else, but I just wanted to give my opinion about it.

AFAIK it is just more or less a meme used to say that you are up a good amount from your original "investment". So when lambo?

Try to look at history and price formations over the last years and try to find any mathematical similarities (parabolic growth for example) if you want to do it the TA way. Otherwise, it is just pure speculation. If we all knew BTC would've dropped at 20k, we would have probably all sold there but most of us didn't know either...

Only buy what you can afford to lose. If you buy with either your college savings or a loan you can not afford that. It is better to work your ass off for these months when the market is still not at a very confirmed bottom and buy over this period. Consolidation at bottoms mostly take up some time before we return bullish (historically speaking for BTC) so there is some time for you to earn money you can lose.

If they are short on BTC, they will probably buy it OTC so the average joe will probably not experience much of it except a slow network and a maybe a rise in transaction fees.
