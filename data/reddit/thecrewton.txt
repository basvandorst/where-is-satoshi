My dad's power plant produces 824 MWe and my plant makes 500MWe.  I think I'd be fine mining for awhile.

Yep!  The job sucks but pays well.

Got mentioned in Portlandia as well!

That's not how it works.  You'd put an order in for example 1000000 coins for $1000000 per coin. Then people would sell their coins at $1000000 to you until you got your 1000000 coins.  Now being able to then turn around and sell those 1000000 back for $1000000 a piece is another story.

Didn't realize you guys were so large.    2nd largest campus.  The university numbers are  
Do they not have a large fanbase?  With numbers like that you'd think BIG XII would want to tap that market.

Mostly through the navy.  They do let non navy people in every now and then but it's not likely.  Most people in the industry are 50+ which will be nice when all the old navy people leave and we can get some new blood in

Would be neat if health care advanced that far to reach that day.  I'll use my bitcoins to keep buying new organs.

Under the "fair use" provision of U.S. copyright law, Yankovic and others do not need permission from original artists to satirize their work, as long as royalties are paid. But to stay on friendly terms with other artists in the industry, Weird Al asks for permission before recording anyway.

What if I were to tell you that what you are using is in fact not money and that Bitcoin is the real money?
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:43:25
Hmm I should send it .03btc so at least it would be 13.37

Yay Nebraska!  I got my email too.

I like red ate.  So many threads asking about the best places to eat xxx on most local subs.  Having a database of reddit approved restaurants would be neat.  Did you also mention this on the warlizard forums?

I liked the idea from the other thread as: The Decentralized Network.

I know the rupiah has been sinking for years now.  It's getting nice around 14k for $1.  It's so cheap to go there.

No, I have it but I can't do anything with it.

Thanks much!  I'll start going through gift cards now for my shopping needs!

When steam accepts bitcoins, I'll buy half life 3.  Hmm which to come first.

Is your name for when people forget to put a space when they tip people?  Hmm guess it wouldn't work since the amount goes inbetween.  Have an internet.

When did you buy your mercury and at what price?  Then look at what btc was selling on that day.  Instead, hypothetically spend the same amount in btc on that day.  Then cry as you'll never mine that much btc.

There is another sub for this.  I think bitmarket?  Good luck to ya!
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:34:58
Which is fine.  Who needs money when you're dead.

I've tried to convince my coworkers of bitcoins since it went from $6 -&gt; $30.  Oh well, they are only hurting themselves! I'm from Omaha.  I guess bitcoins haven't gone deep enough into the Midwest yet.

Same thing happened to me  in 7th grade.  We had to do a report on current events so I did mine on the Monica Lewinsky scandal.  I failed for not being school appropriate...she took off 5 points every time I said penis.

Chemical engineer is not a chemist.  Says the chemist :-P.  Platinum and palladium are the only two that don't oxidize easily.  Gold will still tarnish just slower than silver.  It's just the best they had.

That's also assuming 0% return.  If you put it into s&amp;p 500 stocks with an annual dividend of 3% and live off of 2% and reinvest 1% you'd have 92k a year while increasing your principle.
