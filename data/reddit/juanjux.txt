Some corrections: 1. You only have to pay autónomos on non investment earnings (for example if you do freelance work) so you don't need to pay it if you invest in crypto and have another job or all your earning are from trading. 2. That 45% in the declaracion de la renta are from earnings from a job, investments are 20% and while are declared in the renta as capital gains are not subject to the IRPF tramos. If you made 400 with your YouTube channel and you didn't have another job that would be below the minimal bracket and you shouldn't have to pay. 3. You have to declare capital over 2 millions, not 600.000 ([Patrimonio, ITP]( but I think is not taxed until 2 millions, and I think crypto is currently exempt from that.
Advice: get a tax advisor. They'll find the best formula for you. For big amounts it'll probably be to set up a investment based company, but I'm no expert.

The longer you HODL the less chances that a bubble burst affects you. For example I reentered into Bitcoin when it was at 1800. I've been dollar averaging weekly since them and currently the average buying price is around 3800. So if the bubble burst at 5000 I'll be laughing at all the naysayers. And historically after a burst Bitcoin has recovered the original price (trough slowly).

My country (Spain) has this distribution pension system. It's expected to crash in the next couple decades because of the decreasing population specially as us baby boomers (here in Spain that would mean born in the late 70's) start to retire.

As for your first question, the answer would be that trying a 51% attack on Bitcoin would be, at least now, incredibly more expensive than any other altcoin, so it's safer.
The second question answers itself. You don't need a Monero for the money that you want to see, so of course governments could make monero illegal and it would have any effect on it, probably the opposite (the monetary value could go down, of course).

You could even "top up" a channel (the technical term is "rebalance") if the counterpart supports it.
For example, imagine you open a channel with the Coinbase hub and credit it with 10 mBTC. Then you buy stuff with it until the mBTC are spent (which means all are in the coinbase side of the channel). In theory to have more funds you then should close the channel (paying fee) and open another one (paying again).
In practice the hub (Coinbase) could support receiving either a 10mBTC on chain transaction and on receiving it move the channel coins again to your side (so you would only need to pay one fee) or even a fiat money transfer or credit card payment equivalent to the 10mBTC for the same result (and no miner fee). So you wouldn't need to ever close the channel.

The blockchain stores everything. So if you bought in localbitcoins and sent to your wallet, and have the addresses, you could sent them the printed page with the tx and the price at that date. I don't know if they will take it, but there isn't better proof.

@_date: 2017-12-10 21:21:31
Fees are stablished by the lighting network nodes in the route from your wallet to the destination. Just like with TCP there is a routing layer so there are several possible routes to the destination. It's expected that the routing will try to find the cheapest nodes. If nodes start to increase the fees, others will use the chance to add cheaper nodes and get those fees instead.

How is the European model less efficient? I earn three times the average salary in my country, yet pay less every month for healthcare than the average medical insurance in the states. It covers everything except dental. My family is covered. Medicines cost a fraction of what they cost in the states. It covers all the population, people that can pay and people that can't, with the same coverage. Nobody dies here because they can't pay medical of medicine bills. Nobody gets economically ruined for life or has to choose between their children college (which is also universally paid for by the way, no student loans over here) or its health. 
It's funny how a lot of Americans criticize the European healthcare system but not the fact that they pay for their army more than the next 20 countries with more expensive armies.

And none of them would work at massive adoption scale only using the blockchain. Ethereum is having problems with that crypto kitties crapp, so much that an ICO had to be delayed. Maybe IOTA, but then their security model is so weak they need a CENTRAL server validating transactions. 
If Monero had, not massive, but the current Bitcoin load, it would be a shitfest like no other. They're already paying more than Bitcoin right now in fees with much less load. I love Monero by the way, but scalability is definitely not its strong point, even with variable sized blocks which eventually are bad for decentralization; my computer took two days to sync the blockchain and I've a 300MB connection.
Second chain solutions are the only ones that will work at massive scale and in that, like in many other things before it, Bitcoin is leading.

I must say that at the final part of the housing bubble here in Spain we where building more houses than the rest of Europe combined. Also, during the tech bubble there were crappy startups everywhere where the owners knew they're bullshitting the investors BUT most of the investors also knew that but didn't care because they expected to go up anyway. So maybe the previous poster was onto something.
The altcoin/ICO explosion remembers me a lot about the dotcom bubble, and when it burst it could harm Bitcoin, but I don't think it'll be so drastic as people expect. Bitcoin is the IBM or Microsoft of this bubble.

You've to pay a minipal part. I don't know exactly how the British system works, but here on Spain you can choose your career depending on the grades on high school and a final exam. So if you got a very good grade you could go to med school for example (for other degrees is enough to pass).

There are middle of the road solutions meanwhile that could be tested before a somewhat kludgy second layer (because, lets admit it, payment channels are kludgy by the need to prefund and open and close channels when the funds are spent). 
For example Raiblocks support aggressive pruning of the global ledger because of the simple fact that every transaction includes the current balance of the address (account) so you don't need all the previous blocks at all if you prune.

I think that consensus about not increasing block size was when Bitcoin fees were under 2$. Nowadays with 50$ fees my guess is that a lot of people changed their minds. The fees have excluded small investors, small payments and all the third world. Steam have removed Bitcoin. You can see the people changing their minds in this thread, just checking the post history. I surely changed my mind. Satoshi favored increasing the block size when blocks were full. This is not SatoshiVision, just common sense.

Opening and closing a channel go into the blockchain and this have fees. But a single channel can have an unlimited amounts of operations outside the blockchain so no fees there. In theory if people used bitcoin the same to buy stuff but switched to channels, miners would get less fees, but in practice more business would accept lighting channels and thus the miners would balance the fees lost on individual transactions by the fees gained because of the opening/closing of channels.

Could be. I've algo been hearing this for years. I sold some 20 bitcoins in 2012 with good gains but in retrospective that was an error. 
Only 0.02% of the money in the world is in bitcoin. I really think that it could go to 1% in the following decade, which being basically inflationary would mean a much higher price. Not forever, of course, just like with gold, not everyone will be investing in Bitcoin no matter what, but despide being 4.000 now I really think it could go to 10.000-50.000 in some years for this reason. 
There are also other interesting coins. My favorite altcoin is Monero. Unlike Bitcoin, it's completely private, both sides of the transaction and even the amount. It's total capitalization is very small right now but when you consider that 52 trillion dollars are hidden from the taxman (fiscal paradises, undeclared goods, etc) if only a minuscule part of that goes to Monero the price can shoot to the sky (they're less than 50 dollars right now).

You need to learn better. Debt is how money is, created. 98.5% of existing money, to be precise. If I ask a credit for 100.000 euros and give you 20.000, you can be sure its as real as it can be in our absurd financial systems. And when this lended money or debt as you call it is deposited in a bank account, the receiving bank accounts it as real money. And then they can issue more debt because of that deposit and repeat the cycle.

What if it's the government stealing your money, turning every 36$ into a penny (Venezuela, 1930's Germany), converting it into another currency without your permission and limiting the amount that you can use every month (Argentina), just allowing the banks to give you only a part of it because they're broke (Albania) et cetera, are you insured against that? 
Have you ever tough what would happen to our rock solid banking system if everybody did a bank run and asked not for all but only 20% of their money? Are you insured about that? 
Do you know of banks operate and create money from nothing when they give a credit but when that credit money is again in an account they count it as real money and allow themselves to now give another credit several times bigger than the amount of virtual money? 
Some economists say the next credit crysis is coming fast and governments will be unable to bail out (with your taxes) most banks this time. Are you insured about that?

BCH is a walking dead thanks to the EDA. In less than three months if the hashrate swings continue this way they will have the reward having. At that point if BCH isn't worth at least 0.35 BTC, it won't be worth for miners to switch at the current difficulty reduction. Then the difficulty will have to be so low that when the miners switch they will be having two blocks per minute. Which will mean than the next halving will be in just over a month and a half. Then repeat again with half the time (4 blocks per minute)... 
They'll need to half fork to remove or adjust the EDA or the miners reward, but then it never will be more profitable. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:11:35

It's like you have LTC and BTC wallets and so do I, then I want to buy some LTC to you with BTC and we agree on the exchange rate, but without atomic swap nothing warrants that you wont pay after you get the BTC if we don't use a scrow service (and even then you could not pay or delay the payment as much as you want) but with atomic swap as soon as you receive the BTC the LTC would automatically be sent. 
Combined with the lighting network this could enable external and merchant services where you could pay with any coin you want but the merchant gets another coin that it accepts. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:18:46
What firepower? A PoW change would leave their ASIC useless for mining bitcoin. And until new ASICs are developed it would be GPU mined. Good luck doing a 51% attack with that. Most current miners would be ruined anyway.

I don't think so. Do you know of the shortages of GPUs that have gamers all angry about miners? (I'm also a gamer, that's the main purpose of my GPU actually). There is a lot of hashing power in GPU miners right, I don't know if more or less than the Bitcoin farming farms, but still a lot, no risk for security I think. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:20:37
The problem is the scarcity of competitive miners because those are only made by a single brand, so expensive that they're mostly not worth without super cheap power, and with a three month wait. 
The best thing that could happen to Bitcoin right now would be for somebody to release cheaper and competitive ASICs without the wait period.

Greece is a developed country. So was Argentina when the government ordered the banks to convert all acounts in dollars to pesos (like having your btc converted to dogecoin) and then kidnapped everybody bank accounts. 
Banks also robbed most developed countries, including probably yours. It was called "bailouts" and it was done with your hard worked tax money (or your parents, if you are a teen like I think you are because not having lived most of this).
Germany also was a developed country in 1930. The most developed country in the world by science, academic and industrial achievements, but they entered an hyperinflation loop. I think we don't need to assert that it didn't end well. 
The Soviet Union was also maybe not capitalist but certainly developed. When it fell they could wipe their asses with their rubles because it was worth less than toilet paper for a time.

I usually take a look at Electrum wallet (the one I use) estimates of time from fees. Usually 70-80 cents put me in the two hours range (usually a lot faster). People is buying and selling BTC like never before today and that is hitting the fees (there are also some scumbags spamming the network).

The most dangerous and probably common way to stole a user wallet is a keylogger trojan. I've family and friends burned by this, not with Bitcoin since they don't use it but will social networks and email accounts. Windows users, of course. 
2FA can protect parcially but not totally against this; if the hacker is fast or the trojan implements auto login to certain sites when the user input its code you're toast. Some guy recently reported on some of the crypto subreddits I follow to login with 2FA on a fake bitterex site and got everything stolen in seconds. 
Protonmail two passwords system doesn't protect against this either, enable 2FA with it too. And of course if your phone is compromised, your 2FA could also amount to nothing. By the way I wouldn't trust any Google or American company with my 2FA, remember that is the country of gag orders and the three letters agencies.
So, best way to be your own bank is to get a hardware wallet and never leave on exchanges more money than needed for whatever trades you need to do.
Linux is also a good advice, but you need to keep it updated (Ubuntu automatically install security updates, if you use other distros enable that if it isn't by default). A virtual machine with Linux under Windows doesn't really provide more security since a keylogger trojan could get the input all the same (but it could be harder for it to guess the sites you're logging into). If you don't want to change your main OS, and old laptop with Linux for your crypto stuff or a bootable USB could work too. This would also protect you from a border agent asking for your wallet passwords (this can happen if you're not American, really).

I see your point. But the second case it's not better because even that super simple ASIC can be improved either but brute force (more processing units) or by better logical design. Either way you end with ASIC designs that will be expensive and will totally obsolete previous designs and makes them unprofitable , just as happens now every time Bitmain releases a new iteration.
At least the memory bottenecked algorithms will be much harder to optimize because only faster RAM can improve the performance and that is usually available to everybody as soon as designed. 
Let me give you an example of how equihash and other similar algorithm work. Imagine that you're a courier that need to retrieve ten packages from ten houses. With your van you take 30 seconds between the houses, but then you've to wait for two hours while the package is prepared. You can give the courier a Lambo so instead of taking 30 seconds between houses it takes 5, but you can't do anything about the time to prepare the package. 
The courier is the computation, that you can speed with an ASIC. The package prepare time is the RAM retrieval speed (but in reality it would be actually slower relatively).

I entered two months ago and started dollars averaging 650 euros every month (don't worry I earn much more than that). 
I've now invested 2005 euros and they're worth 3250 now. It's not only BTC, I also have Monero, Dash, Neo, ETH, IOTA and OmiseGo, but most of it is BTC. I'll probably sell the ETH and OmiseGo soon (I dislike almost everything about Ethereum, so I'm betting for Neo or Tezos to win the smart contracts race). 
I have invested in BTC in the past. I've emails from 2012 where I solt huge amounts of Bitcoins for 500 euros. I won more fiat than invested in the end, but I would be rich nowadays if I had just keep the BTC. Not repeating that error, now I'm a HODLer. 
I also set up a fund for doing "daytrading" (or as I call, it, playing) buying and selling with a one minute precision, with low 0.5-0.8% margins. It went from 0.1 btc to 0.166, so 66% more bitcoins, but it's too much work so I added it to my long term fund.

Scrypt is not a memory bottenecked algorithm, trough, and wasn't created for the specific purpose of avoiding ASICs (its main use was make brute force attacks against password files much slower). 
Edit: Scrypt as used in Litecoin is not RAM bottlenecked because it uses so little memory (128KB) that it can fit in an L2 cache, that is what the ASICs do. Other memory hard algorithm implementations doesn't have that problem.

The blockchain is the same size for everybody so a several terabytes blockchain will probably say much less people runner nodes and only pretty rich people mining. 
I saw a video about scaling to a city of the size of San Francisco first and a chunk of the world population later (can't link now - on my phone) and the scales were of blocks in the range of gigabytes. So increasing block size is really only a short term relief, while other smart solutions like off chain transactions and sharding could provide the real scalability. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:07:14
The thing with equihash is that is a memory bottenecked algorithm, so doesn't matter how fast the ASIC is, it'll still depend on the memory speed. And RAM on latest computers (high end) and GPUs is the faster RAM that you can buy. For example when I'm mining ZCash any overclock on the GPU speed has almost zero effect while overclocking the VRAM increases the hashing speed linearly. 
Even it a computer with a lot of RAM would have an advantage, it's something that could be cheaper than Bitmain ASICs, with the advantage that you could have the parts ordered on Amazon in one day instead of waiting three months for Jihan to make money with the hardware you paid already. 
It's true that a lot of people has invested a lot in mining hardware. But if they move to another coin like bcash or an hostile takeover like Segwit2x, a change in PoW is that the only survival option for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:52:05
I didn't ask that. What I asked is if the source provided can be used to build a worked binary. Because without that, providing the source is worthless since nobody warrantee that in the binaries you, or a rogue employee of a hacker on your servers can add malicious code to empty people wallets. 
The "trustless" part of Bitcoin is there for a reason. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:43:58
Yes, some time ago I requested them to update the source or remove the open source claims from the Google Play description and they did the later, so its pretty much confirmed. 
The old source could still be forked (wish I had time for that, too many stuff already filling my free time). 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:43:58
Yes, ASICBOOST, nothing to do with SHA256 vulnerabilities, it allowed some miners to mine almost empty blocks to get the reward faster, will be impossible to do with the new transaction types (Segwit). 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:17:22
AFAIK IoT devices are supossed to delegate the PoW to a hub (that can be in your house, the factory, whatever) , but they are designing a small and cheap ASIC chip so not even that hub is needed. 
It's clearly that is still very early to know if this will be safe and scale as intended, but it's promising. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:09:45
That's why I diversify. Obviously Bitcoin won't be going up forever, it'll stabilize at some point (which will be good for it as a currency) , but I really think it has a long way to go (up) before that. Only 0.02% of the world money is in Bitcoin right now. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:07:19
Yeah. It's not like there is little potential hashrate. If Bitcoin suddenly made GPU mining profitable again (more than 1$/day for example) a lot of of us mining shitcoins with our GPUs would jump without a doubt (I would prefer to mine 1 euro/day of Bitcoin than my current 2.5-3 of RandomShitcoin).
CPU friendly PoW on the other side I hope is considered a thing of the past, because botnets of compromised computers would ruin it for everybody else (take a look at how unprofitable Monero is for an example).

It's for this reason that an ASIC resistant algo like equihash would be better in my opinion. Yes, you have basically only two GPU manufacturers, but 12.5 BTC/hour at most is pennies for them and the decentralization couldn't be better. Gamers would be angry though...
CPU algos are worse because they could be dominated by botnets (a little like what I think is happening with Monero since it's already basically unprofitable for everybody else).

It's like the DotCom bubble, I think, it bursted but we got some nice companies out of it. I personally see some future in Monero (52 trillions of dollars are hidden from the taxman around the world, think for a moment about this amount) and one of the smart contract platforms (Eth, Neo, Tezos, probably only one of those will get the smart contract hegemony at the end). 
Other coins whose value is just in being the token of a product (Sia, Golem, etc) I would bet will disappear soon, except maybe Factom, which I find interesting. 
Other coins whose value is being a faster Bitcoin (Litecoin, Dash, etc) are going to have a hard time against LN-enabled Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:53:10
Other alts that I find interesting besides XMR: Litecoin is probably the testbed of Bitcoin. Much better for small payments too. 
Dash has interesting governance, a budget for development and marketing defined in the protocol that free itself from outside companies and instasend. 
 IOTA is the only coin that is experimenting with something different from the blockchain (the tangle), zero fees and theoretical much higher scalability, trough the security of that still needs to be proven and  currently has some central servers that in theory could be removed once it has more users but that currently make it non trustless. Byteball also have an acyclic graph and currently works much better than IOTA, and have really simple to use contracts, but has fees and it's not trustless. 
And of couse there are the contract based coins. I personally despise Ethereum for its centralization and history, super shitty programming language (with a multimillion hack per month), a leader with an scammy past and history of blockchain-rewriting but NEO and Tezos looks interesting (specially the last one if it implements what the ICO promised). 
If I had to vote for the ones that will survive after the alt bubble pops it would be those (plus Monero). 
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:50:50
Wait until their super accelerated block times brings a halving in few months. Then they will enter an Difficulty Reduction Spiral of Death where they will need to produce 60 blocks per minute to be profitable which will bring the next halving in half the time which will need to bring 120 blocks per minute which... 
And that is considering that the respective values of BCH and BTC stay the same. Which will probably not be the case since it has suffered a huge bump that is already deflating while Bitcoin is going up (a lot of believers in BCH must have lost A LOT of money these days).

I'm starting to think that bcash and the EDA cluster fuck is actually things going on as planned. For a few months the EDA difficulty adjustments will steal some part of Bitcoin hashpower, at the expense of producing blocks at a ridiculous rate (30 per hour on average, sometimes up to 50). It will eventually kill BCH because of the inflation and rewards halving in an accelerated way (first in 3-5 months, second in 1-2...) but is time enough for causing enough fees and harm that people will think the Segwit2x fork is the best thing ever. 
Or, in other words, bcash is just another piece in this chess, and one programmed to die soon. This is the reason that for 4 days in a row, the price of bcash goes down during the day time of the western markets but then go up during the asian ones. No real investor would be so stupid as to lose money four days in a row, it's just a pump so the profitability is at a level where they can still steal some hashrate. But they're losing because the markets are slowly deciding to dump it (an some smarter traders that have noticed this trend will be making good money shorting bcash on western daylight and longing it on the asian ones). 
Whatever happens in november, there are some sure victims of all this and are the poor guys that drank the kool-aid in rbtc and have been investing on bcash. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:19:22

It's not valueless. It's value is being a currency with these properties:
- Mostly deflationary, vs government and central banks planned "let's make everybody 2% poorer every year do they spent all their money on crap!" 
- Safe from government or bank hands and runaway printing of money or bank account kidnappings (ask the Greek, Venezuelans, Albanians, Zimbabweans, 1930's Germans or Argentinians about the value of this). 
- Secure, un-forfeitable. 
- Private, if you never use a service that associates your public address with your real identity (Monero is much better at this, tough). 
- Easy to store (you could just print a paper with the private key and keep it on a safe place). 
- Almost infinitely divisible. 
- Transferable around the world in any amount, minutes of time and low fees. 
How many government painted paper money do you know with these properties?

I'm not in the Segwit2x camp but I can agree with the company stuff. Bitcoin should have an industry and voluntary financed foundation paying the devs without giving directives, like the Linux foundation. It would also need a clear technical leader (like Linus Torvalds) making decisions, checking with the community on the important ones.

Memory bottenecked algorithms like equihash are extremely resistant to ASICs. Maybe in the future somebody can solve the "the fastest memory is what is already on the market" problem, but not soon. 
Another option is switching algorithms every N blocks from a rotating list of a lot of algorithms. If this is stablished from the start only a hard fork would be needed (but I'm not totally sure about this).

An Antminer S9 can make about 180-200/month with European power prices. But is less every month as hashrate increases so basically you're better buying it.
Alternatively you can mine altcoins (eth with AMD, ZCash with Nvidia) and sell them for BTC in an exchange, or mine with Nicehash that pays directly in BTC (but pays less than mining directly in my experience).

I, for one, will get a Bitcoin backed debit card as soon as there is one using a lighting network channel, for my "monthly misc" account. I'm converting the unexpended part of it to Bitcoin for my long term fund at the end of the month, so it'll be a step less.

You probably have a trojan in your computer sucking your login information everywhere and probably also everything else you write. 
I would dual boot on Linux or FreeBSD/OpenBSD and operate your finances only on these OSes. Not VMs under Windows because if you've a trojan it will suck your info all the same. These OSes are not inmune to security problems but if you keep them updated and don't install random binaries the chances of landing a trojan are much lower. Also, enable 2FA on every service that you use for anything crypto related, including your email. 
Use keepass for your notes instead of Evernote. Choose a strong master password and upload the file to some cloud hosting for backup. Every time you use a third party service that doesn't encrypt client side you're at the whim of a disgruntled employee doing a search for seeds on the services and stealing your stuff.

Ha! I was too cautious, Bitcoin and Monero both blowed by predictions. I feel a little uneasy actually because until lightning network fix the micropayment issue I don't think the fundamentals for such adoption arw there, so it's mostly store of value or speculate, and I suspect is mostly the second. 
But even if there is a huge adjustment or a "bubble burst" I really think it will go to 100.000 or more in the long term.

The only thing a trojan could do in that case would be to change the destination address of a tx, but the address is also shown on the device before confirming (but someone could skip checking that). Both the private keys and the signing never leave the device. So pretty safe overall.

That would be the case if Bitcoin was only a currency and nothing more. But it's also an storage of value (like a savings account or gold) and a payment system (like PayPal or a credit card), and one independent from the financial system. Or like "a technological product" providing a service like the internet or your phone.
 So it doesn't matter if a single bitcoin is worth 100.000 dollars or one pennie with relation to these two usages (trough a little less variability in price would help, but this will come with time and more adoption).

I will answer with another question. Do any region in any country, no matter how old, be allowed to secede or in general do whatever they like against the national constitution (voted by more than 98% of Spaniards, Catalonians included) as soon as there are a 50.1% in favor? Would you support that for any region in your country? Because five or ten or twenty years ago the independentists were an small minority. 
The democratic way would be to work with the government on a serious mechanism in the constitution for it, stronger than temporal whims. That's what the Scottish did. If the government doesn't cooperate, they should vote for get another party elected. That is the democratic way, like it or not.
The base of democracy is respect to laws and working on changing the laws that you don't like while still respecting them. Respecting only the laws you like is not democracy but fascism.

No, but a memory hard algorithm that uses a lot of memory (more than 2-4GB to avoid ASICs with L2 memory) would have minimal gains from an integrated circuit because the bottleneck would still be the memory.
Litecoin got ASIC'ed because they only used 128KB of memory.
Also, a hard fork with a PoW change could incorporate mechanisms to change the PoW with a soft fork in the future or every N blocks. This would express the will to avoid ASICs which would probably avoid somebody investing millions of dollars into developing an ASIC (ZCash and Vertcoin do this).

I think the examples would be clearer if instead Alice, Bob and Carol they used You, VISA and Starbucks. So at the start of the month you open a channel with Visa for 200 bucks for small transactions. Visa then have channels open with lots of people including Starbucks. So when you want to order a coffee you don't need to open a channel with Starbucks because Visa already have one, and your payment is transparently routed troguh it so you don't need to open another channel.
But in the Lighting Network Visa and Master Card probably wouldn't have a duopoly because it's an open market and anybody can create routing nodes and compete on fees. Even if nodes are not so big as Visa's they still can provide a similar service by connecting to other small nodes. So it's more like TCP. 
Another difference is that with credit cards the fee is not trivial for the merchant while with with lighting because of the open market the fees will probably be super small, and the merchant takes the money inmediately (instead of 60 days later!). So it's to expect that smart merchants will prefer lighting payments to credit card ones.

IOTA works like shit currently (slow transactions that only work if you republish / reattach several times) and so insecure that they need to keep closed source centralized servers (the infamous coordinator) to avoid attacks. In theory with more users the coordinator won't be needed, but the are always postponing the date to remove the coordination.
I think the tangle idea is good, but the implementation in IOTA is not. I think a mixed model with a tangle but miners doing the confirmations would work much better. It wouldn't be fee-less, but it be more secure, would scale same or better and decentralized. But they can't do that because they gave all the coins on the ICO (so we can add unfair distribution to the list) and thus can reward miners.

Yes, but it the original drops to 5% of the previous hashrate it would take a long time to lower the difficulty, which would hurt bitcoin.

They useful when for example there is a dip and you believe it will go lower. So you move your BTC to an exchange, sell then for USDT, and when it goes lower you rebuy with the USDT again.
I've tried this twice with 50% of success so I'm not doing it anymore. 
Other than this, I wouldn't feel comfortable holding USDT for more than a day or two since basically nothing warrantees that at some point you can get one dollar for your USDT.

You know, there is a school of economics (Google "Austrian banking") that thinks that a deflationary economy is better because people will still buy what they need but instead of living off credit they'll have money for investing on things that they feel are really worth instead of only the elites investing. Also, investments will be more selective thus doing a sort of darwinian selection of start ups where the crap is removed. 
So the average joe turns from an slave of debt to an investor.
The ICO craze seems to confirm the first part (debters into investors) trough not the second (people not investing in crap) trough that could be a consequence of earning too much money too fast which wouldn't happen on a future more stable crypto world.
Ask yourself: did the middle and working classes were worse in the 60's which a gold backed dollar or now?
Also, I really believe the currency and store of value part is just the start. Smart contracts (hopefully better than Ethereum, my bet would be in Tezos or RSK if they deliver) will eventually allow people to do P2P credit, insurance, etc, completely removing all other current banking uses.

It's not only GDAX. Most exchanges where you can buy with fiat (CEX.io, kraken, etc) the price is about 5-7% more. 
I tough about doing some arbitration trading (sell my BTC on kraken for USD at 4200/BTC, buy USDT, sent the USDT to Bittrex, buy BTC with USDT at 4000/BTC, repeat until lambo) but the USDT to USD price on kraken is 1.05, which would eat the benefit.

That is really hard to time correctly. Easy for a 1% swing, but for "expecting a bigger crash" kind of predictions, this being bitcoin, it could start a quick 20% rally just as you sell (and you just lost 20% of your bitcoins).
What I usually do is sell a little to fiat when the price is going up quickly and everybody is posting photos of Lambos, and buy a little more on crashes (these days I've been buying and will buy more if it goes lower than 6000). This way I increase my stack, but still get some gains. Dollar averaging also works too.

What's not true? I haven't said that GDAX is the more expensive (which is not - the price is higher in Cex.io for example) I'm just pointing that the price on markets where you can buy with fiat is higher on average:
- Cex.io: 4500
- GDAX: 4398
- Kraken: 4304
- Gemini: 4219
(definitely not a 7%)
Compare with:
- Bitfinex: 4126
- Bitrex: 4130
By the way, I would consider the price on fiat exchanges the real one, specially considering all the fishing issuings of USDT lately and the probable wash trading on Bitfinex (its majority holder) take care with these two...

Magic Internet money (Bitcoin, Monero, LTC, Nano, etc) is AFAIK the best application. 
Property titles and such would also be an obvious one. Especially in countries where the government and burocrats can be corrupt or tyrannical. I think Factom is doing something like that.
Real-time tracking of public spending could also be an interesting use case. But we know most public servants don't want that level of introspection.
Smart contracts could be interesting for P2P financing, credits, and so.
Most other uses of the blockchain I would agree that are usually shoehorned to get some money out of an ICO.

You're confusing a very speculative investment with a scam.
A scam is something that is not what you paid for in one sense or the other. Like paying for gold shares and the one selling you the share not actually buying any gold. When you buy a bitcoin, you get a bitcoin and you can move it to a wallet you control where it will be yours forever.

I really think Bitcoin is not going to disappear. Also, it has utility, especially for some countries where the financial system is even more unstable than crypto. Check the haircut on accounts in Cyprus, the corralito in Argentina, etc. If you've your private key, you've your bitcoins forever, which can't be said for bank accounts (or even houses, being dispossessed it's not unheard of in some tyrannical countries and even in the first world sometimes people get a bad deal in expropriations for building roads, airports, etc).
 The major risk I see for Bitcoin is that other crypto takes its place as the hegemonic currency, I actually have most of my crypto fund in other currencies right now.
Of course moving some of your gains when the market is bullish to other, safer, investments is also wise.

Of course, if I had sell everything at $20.000 I would be much more than 600%. The thing is that nobody knows where the top is so the best strategies with crypto (or at least the ones that have proven to be the best until now) are either to dollar average and hodl long term, or buy when it crashes and sell when it rallies, which is why I do (except I usually sell less than I buy, so my stack increases over time).

There is another factor: if Bitcoin goes over 3.000 it will be in a lot of news, first on technological sites but probably also on more generalist ones and who know, maybe even on TV (but I doubt it since most TV networks are partially owned by banks so they only talk about the criminal usage of it).
 This mean a lot new people entering the party and turning fiat into BTC (today I feel that most of the rise is from people exchanging altcoins since almost all of them went down contrary to the usual rises when BTC goes up).

Maybe in the USA. Unemployment in Spain shot from 9% to 27% in two years, for example.

Yes. That's my fear too. They used Cyprus as an experiment on the previous crisis and it worked (meaning people didn't burn the government's members houses with them inside) so in the next one the "too big to fail" with the governments hugely increased debt compared to 2008 will mean fiat savers will get the blunt of it.

Typical line by startup owners to get young and naive programmers to work for free. Happened to me twice (only bit the bait the first time).

If it goes to 40k it would be intelligent to sell part of your coins to at least cover what you have invested. Maybe investing that in gold or stocks or a fund. This way if there is a crash you can use that to rebuy, and if there isn't at least you diversified a little.

95% is too much. I would prefer to be poor in the EU than in the USA.

Being used as a currency (something that can be done, I bough Total War: Warhammer II a few days ago on Steam using bitcoin) is not is only value. The main value currently is as store of value. One independent of the financial system and governments.
