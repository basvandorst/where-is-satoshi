I'm calling it right now, when we get past 18 we will have an influx of barely legal bitcoin memes.

Mostly just for fun. I actually read about bitcoin back in the day the I was in college and heard people saying it could be worth much more. Back when it was super super cheap, I don't remember exactly but i'm sure you could get a pantload for under 10 bucks. But I had beer to buy and partying to do. Anyway I've been thinking about it more and more and felt I just had to buy some. I certainly think it has the potential to revolutionize the world which is why i'm doubtful the powers that be will let it. We'll see.
I'm mostly just in it so that I have a few chips in the pot in case the winds of change decide to blow my way. I also want to be part of the change by spending bitcoin but paradoxically spending bitcoin seems foolish at this point in time...

I thought that coinbase included their fees at checkout. I purchased XXX.XX dollars worth of bitcoin and they say "we will charge a fee of "N.NN" for this transaction your total is UUU.UU. I certainly did consider the fee but did not include the fee in my calculation, im using only the money spent on the bitcoin itself vs what I received.
edit: I should also note that I bought nowhere near a full bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-30 02:36:06
Yeah I think that the middle and last bullets were what I wasn't seeing. I could have sworn it asked me if I was ok with the fee in addition to what I punched in dollars but it must have been built in. No worries I'll factor that into the buy next time. Thanks for taking the time to respond to the post.

Or maybe Circle *knew* that posting painfully obvious reviews would make it appear that a third party was conspiring against them.

50c was an ATH at one point. When do we see that again so I can buy back in?

If you can handle the potentiality of the price dropping like a rock and then rising slowly back up from the ashes over a period of years all the while doom sayers are trying to scare you with fancy statistics then jump on for a ride. I bought a couple about a year or two ago when the price was between 200 and 400 bucks. Kinda wishing I held on to them now!
@_date: 2016-12-18 14:40:14
Also it seems that the more unstable the world gets, the more bitcoin is worth. When people don't trust their governments money to be worth anything, people turn to bitcoin. With the amount of automation coming to steal working-class jobs and unmitigated global climate change coming to destabilize costal nations and cause drought, famine and war I think that bitcoin will only become more and more appealing. 
There are other cyptocurrencies that on paper will make more sense as the daily currency of the future. But bitcoin will continue to rise nonetheless.

Who got that pizza bitcoin anyway? Was it actually Papa Johns or was it someone on the internet who bought a pizza for the guy. If it was papa johns... what did they do with all that sweet sweet internet money?

I'm pro-bitcoin in this fight but... Alot of you are starting to sound like banks talking about bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-09 16:24:51
Yeah but people with bitcoin might decide to throw some ubtc at a steam sale...
@_date: 2016-02-15 14:27:37
Because Bitcoin can be subdivided into smaller amounts as needed it is pretty unlikely that it would die due to lost coins. The remaining coins would just become worth more. Even if there was &lt; 1 Bitcoin left, that one bitcoin could be worth $10 Trillion or whatever number the market demanded.
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:46:45
Exactly, we just gotta ride the wave with them. China says ban you sell right away, random rumor says China won't actually ban, you buy again.

I'm almost positive it has to take a downward trend for a while but so did a lot of people at 2200 so who can say!?

Hey man real talk ain't allowed. Maybe you could share the image of the bitcoin rollercoaster guy.

No, but identifying people with a tenuous grasp of the english language allows me to weed out fools.

I just bought a bit this morning, seems to be working ok.
The wife and I were going to buy some yesterday morning but I told her we should wait till today because it would probably go back down by then. Lol here's hoping I didn't just buy at the apex. Good ole bitcoin rollercoaster.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:12:31
In four years it will be worth more than 10k per coin or nothing at all.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:55:48
Take all your money, put it in a big pile, and light it on fire. Bitcoin should come out eventually.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:18:02
Its definitely dropping at the moment I would wait until it slows down, at least give it till tomorrow. Then buy what you can afford to sit on for at least a couple years and try not to check the price every 5 minutes or you'll drive yourself bonkers.

Destabilized governments and loss of value of fiat currencies create solid demand in certain areas. Now word is spreading to speculators in places like Japan, Korea, India and they are all losing their collective fucking minds for it.

I like this one actually. Every scifi novel has us believing we'll either have no currency at all or "credits"
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:32:06
I sold at like 300. Because surely this is as good as it gets, I'll buy back in just as soon as it falls back to 200....

So you can sell off all your coin before I do and it hits rock bottom! Never! SLEL! SLEL! SLEL!

Same way I remember how to type my wallet generation seed and 128 bit password. Fucking casuals.

You're absolutely right. I typed 'advise' while I meant 'advice'. Thank you for pointing that out, I'll change it promptly.

It's called "tres commas" you know what that means?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:27:13
Dropping $350 a coin in a couple hours has happened before? Or dropping more than %10 in value in a couple hours? I genuinely don't know but both of those seem really fast comparative to the peaks and drops i've seen.

Just bought back in after almost two years of being out of the BTC game. The FOMO is strong. Really kicking myself for selling almost two coins at under 300 each back then.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:55:27
I feel like this is the most accurate btc prediction i've ever seen. If you want people to trust your take on the current bitcoin trend just point to this post in a couple years and people will have recognize your economic acumen. ;)

Did you just get here son?

Water is wet, the sky is up. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings. If you try to give people advice and don't even know how to write I'm not going to listen to you. End of story.
edit: Mistakenly wrote 'advise' instead of 'advice'.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:10:55
I feel ya man! Bought my first coin in almost 2 years to the tune of $500. Already only worth $460. I should know better I used to watch bitcoin like a hawk. XD
But I knew going in that there was likely a drop in sight and that I could lose some. But overall I'm liking how BTC looks. So sit tight! The drops vision is based on movement!
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:52:58
Yeah, they will still technically be "mBTC" but that will only show up as shorthand on bills and what not. Everyone will just call them credits and only corporations and nations will deal in Bitcoin regularly.
