Listen, I get why you'd think that, but I'm still legit.

Simply didn't want to share personal details about family, nor does it apply to the question.

Imagine actually needing help, and a total stranger on the internet took time to give a thoughtful response...

Right, but beyond a lawyer... which I have, as we're sorting through probate... he doesnt know anything about liquidating assets. And essentially, without liquidating the bitcoin, I cant afford a lawyer myself.

Bruh, you're being a bit paranoid.

Hey man, I'm not flexing. Just need help.
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:43:55
What kinda boat? Im also a captain...
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:50:38
Honestly, just became aware of the inheritance... will likely be wrapped up in probate for months. Have a lawyer, shopping financial advisors, but wanted to begin studying up so I can make informed decisions...
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:15:08
Right, exactly what I'm scared of.

Solid advice, thank you for your thoughts!
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:20:52
Yeah, this is honestly where my head is at.
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:25:18
Appreciate the condolences, truly, but rather not discuss specifics.

Listen, I've been next to brome most of my adult life. Receiving this inheritance is bittersweet, at best. I'm looking for advice regarding the actual sales process... do t want to get mauled by taxes and fees... unlikely I'll ever see this kind of money again and I scared to make a mistake selling it.
