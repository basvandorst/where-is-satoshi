There you go again, assuming as a fact that letting go of the gold standard is positive. Time will tell how sustainable this is. And AGAIN, 100 years is a small blip on the timeline.
Regarding facts - yeah, let's look at the facts, shall we? Since you're so focused on 10 years ago - bitcoin's value in USD 10 years ago = 0, today = 10,000. Nice fact, eh? 
And you haven't addressed the FACT that I pointed out; how fixed supply doesn't equate price volatility. I know why.. Because you haven't an answer to that. 
So shut up, go ride the waves, make "mad gainz" and spend them on lambos/cheap hoes/whatever floats your boat and stop posting like you know anything. M'kay?
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:25:23
My God.. You're an arrogant little know-it-all, aren't you? "Modern" economy with its monetary policy (less than 100 years, with the last 10-15 years being money printing in mind blowing proportions) is a blip on the timeline of human history and is in no way proven to be the only *correct* economy. 
And you said:


which is completely false, as fixed supply coins have served as payment methods for thousands of years. 
Another thing... Fixed supply doesn't automatically mean volatile price, which is proven by gold and other precious metals that don't experience wild hourly/daily swings as bitcoin currently does.
And this:


Economics is a **social** science. There are no fixed rules/principles that are "given" as right or false and that one can "understand/not understand". A lot of highly educated economists are opposing these basic economic rules and principles you speak of - i guess they just don't "understand" them either, right?
So.. Get your head out of your ass and stop jerking off over Roubini's twitter rants and Stiglitz's *revelations*
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:29:55
YES, listen to this guy.  This guy fucks! 
Only in the last 120 years has the world started making PAYMENTS! 5000 years before that, people didn't make payments and there was no economy and no trade! Because there was no moneyprinting before (well, except when the great civilizations started deluding their gold/silver coins with inferior metals, which in the end brought to their downfall.. But hey, who cares about the Romans, amiright?)  
So.. Accept that moneyprinting by central banks is GOOD, that dispersion of this new money to the chosen ones first is GOOD, that saving is BAD (almost criminal, since you're holding back the economic growth!), overconsumption is GOOD, and the world being run by people like [this]( is GOOD!

Price dips are when the trolls, buttcoiners and no-coiners crawl out of their caves and start spreading their doom prophecies ("Bitcoin is dying"), concern troll posts ("Guise, hear me out... I'm concerned Bitcoin will fall to 3K, because.. I'm bullish in long-run, but very worried short-term") and other bullshit. This in term makes the "moon boys" jumpy, since their making-mad-gainz-by-investing-in crypto seems to be failing and they start with panic posts.
Then there's alt-shillers ("Oh, but Bitcoin sux and has no use case. Blockchain will prevail, but something else and better than Bitcoin will be big. Oh btw.. IMO Neo, Tron (insert random shitcoin) has  a strong future, just like (insert random Youtube/Twitter "expert") says).
Then there's those who bought high and sold low and are looking for confirmation. "I was RIGHT! I don't suck because I bought at 19K and sold at 3K. I KNEW Bitcoin is a scam and you all suck!".
Then there's those who are looking to profit on big price swings and want to amplify the price dip by planting doubts in "retail investors" who don't actually give a fuck about what Bitcoin is or what its long-term importance is, but are hoping to make money.

I don't think it's "anything like 2017". Segwit at &gt; 50%, Lightning usage spreading, noone paying attention to BCH clowns and "we'll tokenize the world" scammers anymore, Bitcoin getting legitimized (by BAKKT, other "old finance world" institutions)... Bitcoin's outlook is actualy much better than in 2017.

The only thing that is "highly likely" is that you are speaking out of your ass. Water is wet, fire is hot, bitcoin price goes up and bitcoin price goes down. It will no doubt continue like this for some time (price discovery).

The main reason is what linked below:

By using Bitcoin we're making sure it succeeds and by doing this we're ensuring our future liberty and freedom.
Perhaps Square app and the like, credit cards and other current financial services are currently easier and more convenient to use, but by using those things, we are slowly drifting into a Big-brother world. And if we get there, it'll be almost impossible to get out.

I don't like this  "rubbing it in" game. So the price went up, so what? It can just as well fall again - you don't know what will happen, I don't know... And price is not even the most important thing about bitcoin. 
Poking your friend with stuff like this when the price is going up is why people are sceptical of bitcoin and bitcoiners and see this  whole thing as a ponzi or get-rich-quick scheme.

Depends on what you want to do with Lightning. Running your own lightning node is complicated, yes. But if you just want to open a channel to pay some stuff with lightning, it's very easy to do so. If you're on an Android phone, download Bitcoin lightning wallet, transfer some btc over to an address that the wallet creates for you, then open a lightning channel or 2 to a well connected node from within the wallet (I opened one channel with \~ 100 USD and another   \~50 USD) and you can pay basically any service/goods provider that takes lightning payments.

Enron, Worldcom, Bear Stearns, Lehman Bros... All of those companies made some serious fuckups in their conduct of business (mostly even criminal) prior to bankrupcy. Meaning something changed and got broken in the company which caused the fall of their shares and bankrupcy. 
Was there such a fuckup or cardinal bad change with Bitcoin this year to cause this price decline? Not that I know of. This leads me to believe that this plunge is mostly based on psychology and manipulation, not on anything wrong with bitcoin itself. So there's is no real reason for bitcoin to go down like the companies you mentioned, is there?
  
@_date: 2018-11-28 11:43:20

Yes, give people resources so they can read up about what Bitcoin is and what it enables in a digital world. Not just to focus on price. 
I don't find the current price all that important. Price fluctuations are to be expected because of small and new markets. Price goes up, price goes down, and this brings in speculators and greedy traders. Once a big enough market is established the price will stabilize too.

Hmmm. This article is confusing. It suggests that bitcoin has been supported by Tether up til now. It's comparing Tether to central-bank type firepower and saying that central banks tried to defend their currencies in the past, but failed in the end. So what's it saying? That bitcoin is under attack in terms of sell-off or that it's being attacked by "artifical" support by Tether?
Judging by his other articles, the author is extremely anti-bitcoin,  just check out: [
I'd say this article and Bloomberg itself is part of the attack on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-11-25 15:01:51
Why is fork a problem? Everyone know what the real Bitcoin is and the coin from the other chain is something else (another thing). If someone wants to buy the new forked coins, that's their decision, it's not like sellers can create a market for their coins. What I'm trying to say is, if there are no buyers, there can't be any sellers. So I don't agree with you when you say that fork  doubles money supply - it adds new coin on another blockchain, but if these coins are worth anything at all, it's up to market to decide.
   
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:29:41
You are totally correct. The future of Bitcoin will be  built on many ifs, but that is the nature of future itself, isn't it?
About skepticism. I view healthy  skepticism as good, but destructive skepticism is bad in my opinion. So I try to stay positive with a salt of skepticism - by listening to the other side and being aware of the ifs you speak of.
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:15:33
I don't think anyone in here thinks gold isn't valuable. I've seen bullish predictions that bitcoin could reach 1/3th of gold's market cap, which would be huge. So it's pretty safe to say that bitcoiners are aware that gold will be deemed more valuable than Bitcoin for quite some time in the future. 
But in some regard, gold actually is worse than Bitcoin. Can't transfer it over Internet, can't really divide it. On the other hand, gold is better than Bitcoin in some aspects too - mainly for beauty, because it is so shiny and you can make jewelry out of it. (i don't personally really care for jewelry, but people obviously do, otherwise there wouldn't be such a big market for jewelry in the world)

@_date: 2018-11-25 16:17:15
Sorry, should have included that. Run up was no doubt based on psychology and  manipulation (by this i mean coordinated pumps; and currently wehn it's falling dumps). 
However price of bitcoin going up in the long term is a certain in my eyes. As people recognize the positives of bitcoin itself and not focus completely and only on price, more and more will want to have some. In a completely  digital world of the future, bitcoin/crpyto will probably be the only thing that's really yours, that you actually own, so owning some bitcoin seems like the smart thing to do. And since there are almost 8 billion people in the world, all of them will compete with each other for bitcoin which is limited to 21 million. This will make the price move up, it is inevitable - again, my  expectation. The price you speak about, 3000 usd or even way less, can happen long term only if bitcoin is used by only a very small population.

I think a lot of people are selling to buy back in lower. Many will probably get burned this way and will have to buy back in higher. 
What you said about being bad for adoption.. I have seen some experts say that this could be the effect the dumpers are going for  - to keep people away from crypto, because it is something states cannot control directly. If this is true, it is even more of a reason to buy in my opinion. I don't want to live in a world, where all my payments have to go through banks and govrenment control.
