Hopefully. $16 is crazy

That reads like it was written by an elementary school kid. Theres no way that is a legitimate statement.

Thanks for the explanation

Does GDAX allow you to use Debit/Credit cards? Cause thats why i have been using coinbase

around 4500 btc
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:29:12
Yeah i think ill do this. Can you use debit/credit on other sites that support segwit? Thats the main reason i went through coinbase.

Just because people are new and dont know everything about btc and the lingo doesnt make them "retarded". People want to learn and asking questions is the best way to do so. Running into people like you wont help them and it wont help btc.

Some people are saying they arent getting as much as they did on NiceHash, but it depends on what coin you are mining and your hardware. Also when you are mining they keep track of your money in Fiat currency like USD rather than bitcoin. Therefore if you have earned $10 and bitcoin jumps up in price you will still have $10. This isnt necessarily that huge of a problem since you can cash out in btc once you get $10, just something to be aware of.

Winminer, but it is having difficulty with all the people switching over to it from NiceHash. Im currently using it and getting the exact same amount per day. The nice thing is you can cash out once you reach $10 (not 0.01 btc ($143) like NiceHash) and can choose to take your payment in BTC, USD, Paypal, ETH and more.

People have been saying that's one possibility, but i feel they would have made much more money just off their fees alone if they continued business as usual.

What is the purpose of futures? Just seems like betting to me. How does this effect bitcoin as a whole? Sorry im still a little new to this.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:27:25
Can you change the fee and have it be longer on coinbase or only on GDAX?

Coinbase gets a lot of heat here, but it would be the easiest to buy from for someone new.

send it to me and ill turn it into 1.25 μBTC and send it back
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:38:29

lol. It is unstable. You could buy for today at $3800 and in a week it could be at $1500. You never know. Then once the bank starts calling and asking where their money is what do you do? Only invest in bitcoin what you are willing to lose and definitely do not invest other peoples money in it.

you seem a little upset bud. Want to talk about it?
