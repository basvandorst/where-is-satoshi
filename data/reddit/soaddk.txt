So. Are you rich yet? As I said - see you at 5K.

Proof doesn’t work like that. Unless you’re religious. Seems like the kind of argument a religious person would use to defend his or hers beliefs. 
“Just because god hasn’t shown himself doesn’t mean he doesn’t exist”. 
While technically true it’s a bullshit statement which can be used on almost everything and therefore adds no strength to any argument.

I'm not 100% sure, but it seems to be the consensus on this sub.

See you at 5K, chump
@_date: 2019-10-20 16:48:33
Keep chugging that cool aid, bro.
@_date: 2019-10-17 07:44:54
Just waiting for it to hit 5K then I’m gonna buy a shitload.
@_date: 2019-10-26 16:40:06
LOL. Are you new at this? Do you think time stops now? Come back in a month or two. 
Again. I’ll buy around 5K.
@_date: 2019-10-20 09:48:32
Agree. It’s gonna go down, down, down before it goes above 10K again. 
I’m gonna buy a shit ton when it gets below 5-6K.
@_date: 2019-09-06 05:00:38
Lol yeah. Didn’t even see that before now. My bad.
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:39:18
Of course. But making it public is an entirely different thing.
Edit: if Apple can do for cryptocurrency what they did for the MP3 player and smartphone it could be huge.
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:30:59
One guy even said 500k++ in early january
@_date: 2019-09-06 11:46:06
Well. Twitter has given bitcoin thumbs up - so why not. :-)
@_date: 2019-09-06 09:44:48
Apple is also involved in the cellphone business. The communication choice of drug dealers and money launders.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:21:20
Or in my case - buying 2 weeks ago. Who knew losing money could be this easy?
@_date: 2019-09-05 19:32:00
ITrue - internally. But externally they have been prone to go for own IP. FireWire was an Apple only tech, right? I think we’ll see a more open Apple from the hardware side in the coming years, as they focus on their software and services.
@_date: 2019-09-05 19:32:21
Agree. It’s still a couple of years down the line.
@_date: 2019-09-07 16:00:03
SELL SELL!! IT’S CRASHING!
@_date: 2019-09-05 16:42:55
Apple should add bitcoin to their wallet app.
@_date: 2019-09-06 04:59:11
a) I think you missed my point
b) 90% of American teenagers use iPhones
@_date: 2019-09-05 19:30:08
Well. Apple has been dipping their toes into financial waters with the Apple Card in collaboration with GoldMan Sachs (sp?) so I don’t think security is a problem anymore. Also because with their recent focus on privacy they are in the proces of taking this aspect to a whole new level.
I would trust Apple for something like this over any other major player (full disclosure: I am an Apple fanboy).
@_date: 2019-09-05 19:48:32
Thanks for the info. Didn’t know that. :-) shows how little I know.
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:37:26
Agree. There were a few cringe moments when he talks about live stock.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:22:22
At least you didn’t but at 10K like me. FOMOed like a motherfucker....
@_date: 2019-09-06 14:35:05
Wow wow wow. Just because YOU don’t find it interesting doesn’t make it irrelevant to everyone. This is not r/maxcoiner, so take a chill pill and keep walking, brother.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:30:53
I second that. I’m in for the long run now. XD
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:00:11
But more relevant than third world countries in this context.
@_date: 2019-09-06 05:34:48
If you mean like how they took technology that only a small percentage off people could use because it was too complex and made it useable to everyone and their grandmother, then yes. :-)
Apple hasn’t made many original inventions. Their strength is making complicated technology useable by everyone which is exactly what crypto currency need if it has to move outside the “tech geek” sphere.
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:05:43
Your comment didn’t age well. :-)
@_date: 2019-09-06 08:52:43
LOL. I see what you did there. ;)
@_date: 2019-09-06 04:57:50
Don’t you mean Applecoin 11 S Max Pro ?

While i am attempted to agree completely I can’t help to think that Apple has taken a few blows in recent years and are now more open to tech from outside the Apple garden. They did incorporate the Qi charger in their phones instead of inventing their own shit.
Also - isn’t Thunderbolt an Intel tech?
So I wouldn’t count them out. It’ll take years, but maybe they’ll see the light...
