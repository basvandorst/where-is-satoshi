I just closed my account, I literally haven't sent a satoshi to them, their fees are too high and there are so many other exchanges.
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:13:07
So I'm putting 25% of my holdings into 4 different alt-coins and one should shoot to the moon and I'll be rich? Sounds good to me.

I don't think you could buy from yourself, that would be sending money to the address it came from, if you restart your phone it may show up, if not your tablet has some local cache stored that lets it know it created that order, you will need it to compete the buy.

So much concern over someone you will never meet, or hear from after she graduates. Lol, let me guess, religious, conservative, lives in bible belt, Caucasian ...?
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:25:09
Love this site, players are serious though so you better be good
@_date: 2014-05-30 00:09:58
Still never got my $10 to my .edu email...

Obviously you've never had more than 1 BTC
@_date: 2014-05-08 22:29:31
Yea I have student.umuc.edu and its been 30 minutes...nothing...not that I need more bitcoins lol.
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:28:04
lol, "But won't transaction costs go up????"
-"uh no they will go down as the network grows"
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:31:01
Shit this guy has 120k bitcoins and he's complaining why? I'd pay some theives to steal all of mt gox's servers and make it rain bitcoins on reddit.
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:18:33
15 minutes? You should try the kwikset locks they have in my area, my front door takes 5 seconds of raking to open.
@_date: 2014-04-29 23:47:08
Stealing personal info is one thing, reserved for the darkest of criminals, but when a half a million dollars is involved? Some kid probably already knows how to access that and is gonna sweep all those wallets CLEAN (hope he is smart enough to use a wallet MIT didnt give him)
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:35:15
Sounds exploitable.
@_date: 2014-07-07 11:44:41
This 'virus' took all of 20 minutes to make, if you encounter something more dangerous it would have changed the address without the user ever knowing, like right after the submit button is hit but before the packet goes off into the world...
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:31:42
Instead of sell, to USD, trade for LTC

The security measures they had in place was a good terms of service agreement.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:34:52
Lol, george and sally
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:28:55
Theres no volume, the price increase is simply just because the markets are slow and there is low supply. The price is inflated by a lot though, if you look at the volume for June of this year, it didn't go up nearly as much yet there was 10x more volume being traded.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:44:24
I believe it is a basterdization of the word: "HODL"

I'm a happy snapCard customer, just got my first package today, they process as fast as I would with my credit card!
@_date: 2013-09-10 19:44:19
One thing on computer security: A clean virus scan doesn't always indicate a completely clean pc, use a virtual box and a fresh install of linux that you only have the wallet installed on.

Everyone getting tipped in this thread, I hope you remember your reddit password in 50 years when bitcoin is $1,000,000,000,000,000 each
@_date: 2013-10-27 21:41:38
Lol came here to say this, most don't even accept credit cards..
@_date: 2013-09-11 04:15:42
Thanks man! I will pass the tip around next time I see an opportunity!
@_date: 2013-11-16 04:36:02
Stupid rich assholes, we will show them, when we are all rich assholes as well!
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:04:48
I guarantee there have been man in the middle attacks on bitcoin wallets, either using spoofed wifi access points or by arp poison routing a free wifi.
@_date: 2013-08-31 05:33:42
We need to go deeper.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:05:37
Are they seriously on drugs? I guess they don't know you will go to one of 50 other banks for the time being while bitcoin becomes big...
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:51:17
I love coinbase, they hold it for 5 days so you don't accidentally sell for less than you bought!
@_date: 2013-08-28 21:39:22
0.05 BTC for 35 site reviews? Certainly a lot faster than my miner is doing right now.
EDIT: Just in case anyone was wondering, they do actually pay: 
@_date: 2013-08-29 02:19:09
It will be very cool after enough people rate all the sites, then we will see a few sites converging to the top 10 and we can see the true top 10!
@_date: 2013-09-11 02:25:11
I feel like the subscriber count in this subreddit have a direct correlation to the overall bitcoin price. I will be watching it.
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:17:07
As long as the mining power goes up exponentially I feel like there won't be a significant crash, maybe a hangover after a bubble but no crashes, long term hold ftw also thanks coin base for not being mtgox
@_date: 2013-08-29 02:11:31
Yea I could see possible abuse there, making multiple accounts and even auto-commenting, you should put a captcha on all the text boxes.
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:45:09
Yea I wouldn't believe it goes straight to him.
@_date: 2013-09-04 23:52:30
Looked at all my throwaways and reddit accounts...nope 0BTC :(
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:01:14
I like the auction 1 copper penny plus a FREE gift of 1 bitcoin, wink wink:

@_date: 2013-09-04 05:48:33
Is it possible for all mining pools to shut down right before the difficulty change in order to lower it? Maybe down to lower than a million and then start up and mine a shit ton of bitcoins?
Surprised no one has tried this
@_date: 2013-09-10 20:14:21
Correct as far as anyone is concerned realistically, although there exists highly personalized malware authors that if they infect your pc, will look around to see if it's in a virtual machine and try to escape to the host computer.
On the flip side it is a little easier for a virus to detect if a VM is running and try to infect it. The basic rule of thumb is 'don't install VMware tools' if VMWare is your product of choice.
Most likely the virus that infects you will not have either of these features, since they are usually trying to infect the mass public and go for what operating systems and programs MOST people are running. Watch out if you are a multimillion dollar corporation though.
Most antivirus today is pretty good but not perfect at detecting rootkits, which are the viruses that hide themselves from detection during a scan, and hide sockets from your firewall. This is what my last post was referring to.
