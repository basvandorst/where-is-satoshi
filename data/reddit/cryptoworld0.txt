Useful post.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:17:47
Thats the issue right now with fees, they are way too high.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:16:14
Maybe you should post something interesting OP?
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:43:29
What a great post in the early morning.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:20:17
There is nothing crashing, chill my man.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:24:47
If we are going down, he comes with us.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:58:08
You don't have to pay fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:17:11
It's really disappointing adding a coin without any announcement or something, kinda greedy of them.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:47:45
Have seen it a year ago.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:48:33
Can be somewhere from 6-18 months, it's gonna worth it though so I have no issues waiting.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:04:15
Seems interesting.
@_date: 2018-05-09 08:50:31
Maybe we should break 10k first.
@_date: 2018-05-09 09:03:05
this is one of the reasons I got in crypto i believe it can replace borders and bring us closer to one world humanity.
@_date: 2018-05-09 08:41:43
This may pump the price but this isn't really good for crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-02 06:04:35
If you look at crypto as an investment then yes but if you think they have some future potential as a currency i don't think  you should use an app which does not let you have access to your own holdings.
@_date: 2018-05-09 08:47:36
Catching the falling knife.
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:33:34
They certainly help in creating exposure for cryptos.
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:44:33
I doubt there's any SEC meeting going on.
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:04:06
if you want to deal in fiat you will have to go through lengthy verification times mate, and if you are not willing to give much info perhaps you can look  for a decentralized exchange like EOSFINEX by bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:38:11
This is one of the most stupidest things you could do with your loan.
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:51:09
Ah... I am glad bitfinex did it properly
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:51:42
yup even though people are selling on bitfinex and buying on other  exchanges I bought a tiny amount worth 100$ 
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:26:26
Lol I could relate to that
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:17:56
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:23:48
that's what they have always been saying.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:47:57
I am no TA expert but I'm pretty sure it will pump back up quite quickly when people start buying it because the price dipped which will increase the price again -basic economics 
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:23:37
Pretty happy about it being implemented on Bitfinex since I only use that for trading
@_date: 2018-03-04 13:11:12
and what for? Wouldn't that make crypto's pointless in the first place?
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:38:36
exactly lol
@_date: 2018-03-05 13:40:11
just a lot of FUD about bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:04:52
You can get on some internet forum and trade your paypal with BTC there at 10% I think.
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:02:57
i do have zebpay wallet but everytime i need to trade I have to  transfer it to an exchange since i do not hold a lot of investment but only about 2000-4000$ worth of btc i can not afford to pay exchange/withdrawal fees everytime 
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:12:06
That's how things are in crypto world, to make a mole out off a hill because half of the community here is no above than 16 and has nothing to do but gossip like old ladies.
as far as I know they said they will go into an audit.
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:52:40
I would recommend you Bitfinex, they have the lowest withdrawal fees.
@_date: 2018-03-05 08:45:40
Yes at the moment they are the lowest
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:08:02
Congrats! Millionaire in a bearish market.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:41:45
So sorry for your loss man, i hope you can recover this amount quick with your business! 
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:58:22
get registered on an exchange which allows you to buy with fiat like bitfinex and buy 
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:44:14
I think your best choice is to tell your parents or sibling about it and ask them to do it for you
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:00:58
I think there's couple of subbredits like bitcoin memes and cryptocurrency memes
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:06:59
it's over 9000!
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:09:58
I doubt you could do that, the only way I can think off is really black hat and I wouldn't discuss it here or even suggest it l
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:27:34
It isn't a coin, I think more like a software which will help detect market manipulation. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:23:23

You never know man + It shouldn't effect btc since it is not er-20 Token.
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:50:27
mm there's plenty but no one is big as Ebay to be honest perhaps one of them may compete with Ebay someday you never know how fast these start-ups grow these days
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:39:11
When did binance became world's biggest crypto exchange?
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:53:48
ah sucks man
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:33:09
Would love to see one where you could explain about how leverages and margin trading works on bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:40:04
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:09:15
Perhaps when bitcoin reaches 20k again
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:11:03
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:04:22
I used to think Forbes is a respectable publication until I started reading their articles about crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:08:02
yup it take time to reflect it in your wallet although for future i would recommend you to buy with fiat from a better exchange like bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:36:48
No , akira toriyama
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:46:05
have you never heard of Bitfinex ?
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:51:13
Lmao Good for teenagers.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:23:19
As far as i  know i saw your thread in other sub-reddit which said you deposit 10BTC which is a huge amount and any exchange that you are not verified on will certainly freeze your account anyway you can unfreeze your funds with simple evidence of your income.
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:55:46
i would recommend bitfinex since you have a decent amount to invest. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 08:52:19
wait for Eosfinex by Bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:01:10
I don't mind paying fees like on bitfinex as long as they have all the things you need for trading, I really prefer their trading tools over any other exchange and I don't mind paying for it. they gotta make profit somewhere plus Bitstamp do charge for Fiat withdrawals 
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:56:13
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:15:25
As far as I know only two exchanges bitfinex and Coinbase has adopted it. Binance,Bittrex,Gemini and others are still behind.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:51:59
1 btc = 1 btc
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:39:11
Why don't you get registered with an exchange like bitfinex instead save your self some trouble
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:40:12
Lol i only have one ETH does that help?
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:08:37
that's the goal
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:05:18
and stupid
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:52:40
stacks in more btc.
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:27:14
even lesser on bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:36:53
Sell the rumor buy the news
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:07:24
Cool man
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:57:40
You made my day, I've been all stressed out looking at the chart whole day at bitfinex thanks for the laugh
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:52:10
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:51:36
I hope you are not posting this because bill is against cryptos
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:46:27
So now there's no difference between Wall street Analyst and an online analyst on reddit both speak BS.

@_date: 2018-03-06 12:10:34
If he had given a better explanation I would've resisted  my urge to call him stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:43:03
lol true! It's on sale !!
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:40:24
Cool man!
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:58:29
I'mma go hatch some coins on my bitfinex account 
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:37:57
Well choose an exchange first of all, I would recommend Bitfinex
Choose a wallet.
Buy Btc with fiat
Figure out your trading strategy, Long term, midterm or day trading
Re-search about coins perhaps join a signal telegram group for guidance and help.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:24:26
Yes I believe it's good time to get some I feel it's gonna go Bullish soon
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:54:42

@_date: 2018-03-21 10:04:01
do you read news? They are under maintenance.
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:30:13
Yup they have
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:51:59
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:58:29
bitfinex even reduced their fees further up to 33.3%
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:24:18
Well at least cryptos are getting us Lambo in someway ;)
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:54:54
Are you sure It isn't your pc issue? Both Bitfinex and binance seems to work fine on my pc.
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:56:26
switch your exchange to bitfinex much better
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:05:13
Ultra instinct? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:43:21
activate quantum immortality
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:21:10
you should always be cautious of people selling butt coins,  jokes apart buy from a major exchange like Bitfinex from next time to be safe
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:59:35
Yup,I started with 50$ and turned it into 12$ in a matter of 30 days only!
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:53:38
No, It isn't the kind of adoption we seek.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:14:32
Is it because off SegWit implementation by bitfinex and coinbase?
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:47:24
If you want anonymity monero is your shot not bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:35:15
When you realize he still has plenty more to sell..
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:57:36
The only exchange to ever go in an audit was kraken few years ago, all exchanges tries to avoid it.
@_date: 2018-03-14 08:05:23
feeling nostalgic?
Feel free to donate ~ 
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:44:33

@_date: 2018-03-02 18:19:00
Exactly why i prefer bitfinex over any other exchange.

@_date: 2018-03-15 04:23:18
i sold, gonna get in at 6k-6.5k
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:32:12
Glad to see this technology being adopted.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:14:07
even though they are scammy, they're trying to shove the crypto underground but it shouldn't effect the price.
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:03:40
Lol man good job mate
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:33:13
poor EOS
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:38:03
he was being sarcastic
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:36:18
That's exactly the problem with youtube there is no quality control even though they are trying to set higher montiezation standards i hope that will help with better quality videos in future since crypto is still in early phase we certainly wouldn't want people to get scammed or fell in their traps
@_date: 2018-03-20 05:12:15
you can't wear bitcoin either.
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:22:52
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:27:31
I was thinking the exact same thing!
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:53:31
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:26:08


Why pay when you can just keep it in an exchange?
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:05:08
How to buy bitcoins on coinbase-
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:58:00
 eh sucks mate good luck finding someone
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:31:25
Articles like this spreads FUD
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:36:46
wait until it goes back up again like every other time.
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:30:40
withdrawals are slow, trading tools are decent.
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:40:38
Just because something has gone up in future doesn't mean it always will.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:28:54
also water is wet
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:10:37
I think your best call would be a decentralized exchange instead of centralized ones probably something like EOSFINEX by bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:15:25
You can put up a small percent of savings even if it 50$ a month in your exchange since price is low i think it is a good time to start. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:30:03
How many times...
@_date: 2018-03-24 09:32:00
I doubt that, tethering is really useful in bearish market.
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:54:36
Bitfinex is safe, you can use a decentralized exchange too
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:33:03
Pretty sure one of those.
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:26:16
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:45:33
Bitfinex is a major exchange, they can't just disappear over night that's not how things work. They are not your localbitcoin.com people.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:53:19
Thank you with your useful insight I have successfully predicted the rise and fall of bitcoin's price now i can finally afford to buy an unicorn
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:20:20
is tron dying already?
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:58:24
yup sorry haven't had my coffee yet!
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:18:23
It doesn't mate but they are free to freeze your account if they find any suspicious activities 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:12:18
You're right but i am pretty sure it has nothing to do with it
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:43:00
Just a piece of advice don't look at 1 hour chart if you don't want to get depressed in past I would spend hours on bitfinex looking at 1 hour charts not a very good time tbh.
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:13:34
You should always have alcohol.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:40:54
pretty cool thanks for sorting out all the important stuff
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:43:15
I am so sorry i haven't had my coffee yet,I misread it. it was a scam.
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:47:16
quite glad about this being adopted by bitfinex 
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:08:27
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:11:37
check the daily chart on bitfinex and you will see it is far away from being over sold yet
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:12:08
I don't wana laugh but this is cruel x
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:37:04
Welcome mate
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:33:41
Ah sucks, sticking to bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:24:56
This why we are down.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:11:10
Bitfinex froze your accounts because you probably deposited a huge amount, are you even verified? You'll need to provide them some evidence for your money like your salary  statement or something. They'll then unfreeze it.
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:51:04
what you high on bro?
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:23:23
That's stupid everyone has the right to choose the coin they like.
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:22:43
@_date: 2018-03-13 05:01:55
I think it's at a decent price right now go grab some up a verified exchange like bitfinex 
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:36:39
Learn blockchain development, I've seen recently many of those courses online perhaps try edx?
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:47:33
would also love to see the fees comparison with bitfinex since i only use that for fiat/crypto pairs 
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:23:58
If you can find someone trusted and respectable on a forum it is pretty reliable.
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:35:16
Glad to see this guy is still around.
@_date: 2018-03-12 05:17:52
The post is just stupid do you except an exchange to be biased? It says exactly what B-cash says on their website.
Boycott b-cash if you have problems with it.
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:10:39
Andriod user here! also since I do not own a huge amount of btc. I've been keeping mine on bitfinex since they implemented SegWit. It's easier to sell/tether to save your self from losses! 
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:19:56
Haha thanks for the remainder mate 
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:09:39
better than an average TA here
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:09:26
true cheers to bitfinex and others for implementing it!
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:50:00
Saw this on facebook advert, what BS
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:48:23






Exactly, finally an intelligent opinion! 
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:41:23
I hope people don't start panic selling after reading this bs
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:06:15
How does that even make sense to you or anyone here?
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:45:20
Really sorry man I misread it
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:15:21
have been hearing this pop thing from a while now
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:59:34
I would recommend Bitfinex as they have best trading tools.
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:46:00
wait for a decentralized exchange like eosfinex or ethfinex by bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:37:27
feel free to donate
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:22:36
even after reducing 50% of their fees, it is still equal to bitfinex which only reduced 25% makes you wonder how much binance and kraken were over charging with their withdrawals
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:04:16
Have you tried bitfinex?
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:32:38
I think you're right
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:50:43
That sucks. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:31:53
lol true mate
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:51:00
 no less than 20,000$  i feel quit confident about it!
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:56:12
If you really wana store them in exchange not a wallet I would go with bitfinex I know people will say that have been hacked so has been Sony since then their security has tighten up which is up they're perfect for storing if you plan to put them in an exchange for easier trading I believe
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:40:10
true man
@_date: 2018-03-03 14:45:33
I highly doubt that, Coo or cto i guess clearly said in press it is because of SegWit
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:55:20
Yup, I buy every week about 100-200$ just started doing this recently.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:49:38
sell it on an exchange with a btc/usd pair like bitfinex 
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:32:29
glad that bitfinex did not mess up anything with SegWit
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:22:50
Just invest for her on your exchange?
@_date: 2018-03-14 08:15:50
try tipping some to me
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:10:41
whaaaaaat nooo
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:50:36
I personally believe so, go get some on bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:16:07
They haven't decided it yet so i will go with legal
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:10:31


Not exactly mate, I hold about 80% of my portfolio in my wallet and rest on bitfinex for trading
@_date: 2018-03-01 10:25:02
Yes Bitfinex has already implemented this also it has increased the speed for Bitcoin transactions 
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:57:23
Hey, useful info thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:18:17

glad to see this tech being adopted by more and more countries everyday! since I am not a very old hodler of bitcoin I think I should buy some more on bitfinex since the price is still low 
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:40:26
pay off some debts, get a decent car.
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:32:33
self conscious bitch
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:37:31
I think it's because of bitfinex maintenance. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:48:56
Mm i see i look forward to it
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:13:56
Bitcoin is not bounded by nations.
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:36:04
Mm looks decent for the start.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:57:22
crypto world is in big hype after December when you see your neighbors advising you about huge ponzy scheme  *Bitcoin* is you know something is wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:34:36
Looks pretty sketchy glad you noticed it 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:47:46
I deserve gold.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:00:36
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:26:32
I think i will still go with bitfinex over shapeshift.

@_date: 2018-03-02 19:44:57
My fault man i misread it i am not a scammer i thought i read on their official twitter page but it was a scam,  haven't had my coffee really sorry.
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:35:53
Bitfinex is a  decent exchange with advance trading tools however you should  put your coins in a wallet it's more secure, although you can keep there certain amount of btc/eth for day trading 
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:05:04
another reason to switch to bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:14:22
yea i read that later i suggested you on one of the comments to get it on some forums that will take paypal for your btc at 10%
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:06:20
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:53:14
Is it free? Does it include bitfinex?
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:15:46
Use bitfinex mate
@_date: 2018-03-05 07:59:37
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:44:12
I would love to to take crypto for my social media agency services but most of clients I deal with has never even heard of the word crypto 
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:04:45
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:21:14
Good luck what exchange did you use?
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:56:03
Really glad to see that bitfinex has implemented it
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:20:10
Said by someone that joined reddit 4 weeks ago?
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:08:17
Girl and bitcoin? together? *Subscribes*
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:16:37
hey it's your son here 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:43:02
I could so relate to this..
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:26:08
True, that's why I am always hesitant of dealing at localbitcoins I'd rather wait until I get verified on an exchange where I can buy with fiat like bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:16:10
We don't either, we will have new better tech replacing it in future. Just like how bitcoin will replace fiat something will replace bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-24 09:29:08

Am i the only one that used to think FORBES is a respectable publication until they started reading their articles on reddit?
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:24:36
True, glad to see it being integrated by Bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:09:00
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:26:08
even lesser on bitfinex mate
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:14:24
I understand and completely agree with you but what arguments and facts do you provide to believe that Bitcoin will reach 50k other than than it has risen up tremendously in past just because something went up doesn't mean it always will mate.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:02:16
Have fun mate
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:51:04

@_date: 2018-03-06 12:18:54

@_date: 2018-03-07 14:48:39
sometime it takes time to reflect it in the wallet
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:36:06
Yea they did, they talked about it on their recent documentary about flat earth
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:41:37
i hope they can deliver it, since we all know companies fail to deliver most of the products they promise in crypto world..
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:27:28
lol 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:52:02
I bought in at 9.8k

How many times will you guys post this?
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:56:54
Price goes wherever they want too.
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:59:47
wouldn't recommend otherwise either 
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:07:11
I love Romania and my girlfriend is from there and i completely agree with you.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:37:31
Bitfinex and Coinbase has already implemented it
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:11:59
Never sell in loss
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:38:39
MAN I AM NOT A SCAMMER I SAW IT ON THEIR TWITTER PAGE WITH A BLUE TICK 
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:42:33
can you please sell? as per the holy law-
Whenever you buy it dips
whenever you sell it pumps
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:26:03
But it wouldn't change the ancient law of crypto
Just after you buy the price dips
Just after you sell it pumps.
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:41:01
me on bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:06:45
Seems like a good day very unusual in crypto world. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:37:21
I think it signifies  that we all are going to be fucked 
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:31:07
I sure will mate xD 
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:07:59
i like crypto kitties.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:08:39
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:37:34
They have EOSFINEX which is decentralized.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:34:17
True haha
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:12:45
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:27:40






That's a lot of information mate
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:21:41
ride the wave
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:54:45
I highly doubt that this is anywhere near reliable, seriously not even mentioning Bitfinex?
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:53:31
I personally think it's quite a decent time to buy it I won't lie i just bought about 200$ worth of btc on bitfinex today when i saw the price
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:15:47
Glad to hear that mate!
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:49:13
I think it's a scam.
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:15:18
man wtf that's so horrible even though people say it is not safe to keep your btc on exchange I still keep them on bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:51:53
but he still owns plenty of btc
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:16:23
because apparently we don't know your expenses are already covered we ain't jesus bruh.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:17:08
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:14:41
There are people that do that on forums for 15% or something
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:51:22
no shit sherlock
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:13:20
I have always loved japan glad to see they have adopted the technology of crypto's so well
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:19:55
Yea man on major exchanges such as Bitfinex you can buy it  easily
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:58:46
Well glad to see crypto picking up every pace of our life
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:57:28
I think this is way too optimistic just like McAfee 
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:21:34
Happy birthday my man.
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:03:44
But media will not speak about them 
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:59:55
Glad to see  this!
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:48:53
mm might think about it meanwhile might stick to a known one like EOSFINEX by bitfinex if i want to switch to a de-centralized exchange 
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:38:55
I AM NOT A SCAMMER MAN I SAW IT ON THEIR TWITTER PAGE one with a blue tick!
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:31:05
glad to see this technology being adopted by every corner of the earth
What else in future?  pay your speeding ticket fine in btc?
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:59:35
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:42:40
I respect his opinion everyone is entitled to his opinion no need to spread hate speech about it and whine about it like a little kid 
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:48:41
Bitfinex and Coinbase are really adopting segwit quite fast
@_date: 2018-03-25 07:54:17
Such a relaxing sunday!!
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:52:32
let's argue until we start calling each other paid shill for our opinions.
every other day in reddit.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:05:57
law of attraction?
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:38:23
perhaps he is being paid to spread anti-bitfinex shill you never know
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:40:01
I don't think the mining hype will stop anytime soon 
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:12:58
The relevance is that you are being a tad bit judgmental mate.
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:43:02
When people realize you can not make money overnight with cryptos
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:46:40
They will certainly use it for money laundering.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:19:02
Still gonna prefer Bitfinex 
@_date: 2018-03-17 06:35:47
Wait it might dip more at 8.1k on bitfinex atm i think it might dip up to 7.5-7.8k
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:06:40
That's certainly a nice piece of advice. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:38:30
Just lot of fud about bitfinex nothing else. Bitfinex is doing a pretty job. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:58:34
If you're just buying it for poker then I think coinbase but if you are looking into getting in trading I would recommend you to get verified with an exchange like bitfinex which supports fiat deposits so you can buy with cash.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:13:56
You'll have a very hard time trying to do that, majority does not even understand why crypto or decentralization is specially those girls with duckfaces
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:39:36
certainly you shouldn't make  memes like this on his death day.
@_date: 2018-03-22 10:33:00
We've eth and ltc
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:47:15
certainly the project is *usable* after all haha
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:08:25
because I don't want to go bankrupt for the tech.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:33:34
RIP one of the greatest mind in this century
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:02:49
Margin trading is always risky~
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:44:17
Yup Glad to see it on bitfinex 
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:06:13
Use bitfinex, they have reduced up to 20% Withdrawal fees
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:21:36
True mate, I have been waiting for better transaction speeds since ages glad to have it on bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-17 05:30:56
what did you smoke man?
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:11:35
I hope.
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:55:37
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:51:16
I hope it goes ultra instinct or at least KaioKen
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:46:46
Lmao this is funny lol
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:11:49

@_date: 2018-03-05 15:18:18
will you give me 5 ltc if i send you 1
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:32:16
Maybe show someone you trust probably your sibling or your wife your exchange account so they can at least cash it out later.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:21:39
Glad that bitfinex has integrated the Segwit
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:09:34
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:57:49
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:34:58
I convert profits by day trading on bitfinex into fiat, I HODL rest in my wallet
@_date: 2018-03-05 13:27:36
as far as my intuition tells me it will either go upward or downward
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:04:46
I am not surprised to see that only 8% of Americans are smart. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:29:58

@_date: 2018-03-31 08:33:14
local bitcoins.com?
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:50:39
mm there have been lot of decentralized changes coming up like Eosfinex by bitfinex recently 
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:02:20
and earth to be certain.
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:37:44
They've been working on improving their withdrawal speeds

bit disconnect
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:33:11
try random day trading on bitfinex haha
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:15:19
lol find people on forums that would mine them and pay them through wire transfer
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:30:44
Works fine on mine.
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:38:19
Sadly that isn't how market work.
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:24:06
This is upsetting, certainly does not sound like FUD if it is indeed issued by central bank of India.
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:23:21
Well We've another reason to unite lol
@_date: 2018-04-01 09:33:59
Meanwhile tries to buy *0.5 btc*
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:08:22
Since you're here for the money not for tech you can use an investment app like ABRA or there are couple of them now a days you can re-search about Bitcoin prices Dips,ATH etc. and choose a buy point, I'd recommend now is a good point to enter into the market and then sell it once it meets your sell target or stop loss target ( the point where you should sell it so you don't lose all your money) and no you can't lose more than $100
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:18:44
And on what intelligent analysis have you concluded the bull run to begin from May-june?
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:01:39
HOLY CHRIST
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:56:35
He's mocking you all, are you guys seriously that dumb?
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:50:12
Maybe you should be more concerned about children that will die tonight instead of your portfolio. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:54:44
I see, the adoption would just increase in future also you can engage your self in margin trading if you register on an exchange that supports it instead of an investment app.
@_date: 2018-04-11 10:06:32
Wall street experts *coughs*
@_date: 2018-04-11 07:14:09
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:07:12
Does it offer fiat withdrawal like bitfinex and zebpay?
@_date: 2018-04-11 09:14:13
Even Zimbabwe is accepting bitcoin, India should learn something!
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:43:34
 Yay adoption is finally picking up 
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:20:37
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:15:36
I find some off it true half of it is BS.
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:15:06
no, In eastern astrology they never considered it don't know about the greek.
@_date: 2018-04-11 07:12:30
I don't need to know where I can or can not invest my money.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:50:22
Well it's good that we are getting more and more government attention but it's a double edged sword.
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:29:30
Us. We will win, we had enough with funding for wars and poverty.
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:19:07
Do you seek to use your holding just as investment? Their are couple of apps like Robin hood and Abra that let you invest but doesn't let you move your coins to a wallet. I would recommend you to get registered on an exchange so you can often  engage your self in trading. There are couple of recommend exchanges like Bitfinex kraken etc.
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:15:36
Why would anyone use that shit?
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:12:25
1 dodge = 1 dodge
much stable wow
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:37:23
Get your self registered on a major exchange like bitfinex or kraken
Re-search don't be stupid like people that bought at the peak.
Buy at the price you feel is comfortable
Withdraw your holdings into a wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:33:17
It is more like an investment app you can't withdraw your holdings similar to Abra or IQ options. If you're looking to hold the coins and believe in the potential future use of the crypto you should switch to an exchange like bitfinex or binance instead of Robinhood.
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:19:53
Still holding strong. I don't know what to do though.
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:34:03
I find you funny.
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:43:34
I believe borders will disappear in 50 years and then a global currency is inevitable. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:50:15
Trying! 
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:04:24
True, it sucks.
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:43:16
You can always get around the system.
@_date: 2018-04-11 10:05:20
but cricket is interesting...
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:35:24

Selling OG websites is always profitable if you can find good OG domain names related to crypto you should certainly buy them  and sell them on forums.
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:43:51
Bitfinex UI is decent but it got some glitches after the recent update I hope they sort it out quick.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:11:18
unless someone spreads an April fool FUD
@_date: 2018-04-07 12:17:09
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:50:52
Bitfinex and binance are certainly making a bank out of these! 
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:42:44
Expecting a squeeze.
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:14:27
You can't just buy it or sell it.
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:20:48
It is. :(
@_date: 2018-04-02 09:12:32
is that a card they give to you when you are in debt?
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:24:42
You go with the one that has features suitable to you for eg if it has margin trading or how many alt coins does it have. I personally prefer bitfinex over binance just because I prefer margin trading over having many alt coins.So it's pretty much up to you.
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:36:24
I got interested in cryptos because it supported one world nation moment.
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:20:20
Wait, I'll open up a short on bitfinex it will certainly go up then *taking one for the team*
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:26:35
lol thanks for the info
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:22:15
 1 dodge = 1 dodge
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:33:50
As in similar situation as yours this is what I plan to do.
I'll keep holding the ETH/BTC I've there never selling in such a loss. Transfer it to a paper wallet.
Sell them on a internet forum when market is bullish again  for PAYPAL/SKRILL/NETELLER  at international market rate, people only charge 10% commission.
Then you can get the fiat transfer to your bank from paypal /skrill or neteller.

It is the first crypto that is why it has the longest running time no other reason and their are cryptos in work with better security than that off BITCOIN. I believe in 5-10 years Bitcoin will be completely replaced with something better.

I heavily invested in EOS  at $6 and have been enjoying the up ride ever since, I expect it to hit to go even further once the main net launches.

Bear market is the time where intelligent investor invests according to Warren buffet even though I missed the 2013 bitcoin's train I've been stacking up BTC and ETH during the dip on bitfinex. I really feel the market is still very young and has a lot of potential and volatility to face before it gets stable. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 07:10:56
Aren't they talking about it... Irony?
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:00:50
You can buy through couple of exchanges such as Bitfinex Bittrex etc.
You can go with stable investment like BITCOIN,LITECOIN and ETHEREUM.
You can also invest in new ICO's but they're risky but could yield great profits. I'd recommend you to look in EOS or you can stick with stable investments since you're new.
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:21:05
Bitfinex, kraken and Bitmex offers margin trading

@_date: 2018-04-11 07:15:06
As far as I remember bull run wasn't due to the media attention, we got media attention when we were on bull run.

Let's see. Do you by any chance has any reason to verify your claim?
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:27:45
But how would we convert it to fiat if the RBI just don't let the exchanges operate?
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:33:37
Pretty much
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:34:59
I think some technical issue at bitfinex?
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:40:12
It isn't slow after Lighting Network and it is also much cheaper after SegWit implementation by Bitfinex and Coinbase

@_date: 2018-04-02 10:30:32
Fine I  know I will get tons of down votes on this but why do you think *only BTC* can do that no other crypto currency? and why would that make it reach 50k when there's decent competition?

@_date: 2018-04-05 03:02:23
Exactly why bitfinex and binance moving to Europe is good news.
@_date: 2018-04-10 09:31:03
Try coinbase,bitfinex or kraken?
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:38:36






True, On one indian exchange that I am registered on people are selling like crazy here the market is down 20% more than the global market.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:28:36
Probably because only 2 exchanges has adopted i so far  Bitfinex and coinbase, I believe when more exchange pick up the pace and adopt it the transactions will certainly rise up.
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:04:33
Never buy in a bull market.

There are couple of internet forums where you can sell/buy it with BTC or any other crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-07 12:17:49
One can still pretty much use International Exchanges which has fiat withdrawal like bitfinex I guess.
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:49:39
It would anyway take 6 months to mine $10.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:16:17
