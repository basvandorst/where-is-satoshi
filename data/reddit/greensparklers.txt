It would be cool if they could be grouped in some way. For example if it is a children's, medical or other charity. 
Just a thought.

Not sure why you are getting downvoted. The only people who could pay in other currencies are the elites of Zimbabwe.

I agree, right now polluters do not pay the true costs of their production. The costs if emissions are pushed to the whole of the worlds population. Increased cost of health care, damage to crops, etc.

No way will Bitcoin lead to a major decrease in taxes. If that does happen, taxing will switch from income to something like a higher property tax. You'll pay more on property you own and you will pay more for goods and services as businesses pass off the cost to customers. 
Bitcoin is not some libertarian magic pill.
