Jesus I think you may be a bit delusional.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:34:11
Yeah I agree, like there's MILLIONS of pages to Wikipedia yet people choose to look at memes and browse forums when they could be reading and LEARNING EVERYTHING, it's a waste of time doing these things...
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:57:31
You're looking at percentages of a number and saying they're similar, if you bought at the height and it's dropped to where it is you'd have lost 9000 dollars, in your example you'd have lost 28. That's nothing near the same. That's like saying me turning 2 dollars into 30 is just as good as someone turning 10,000 into 19,000. He's made 9000 and I've made 28 completely different numbers.

Why would you sell them at all? you're meant to be spending them...
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:08:19
I don't think a majority of the bitcoin world see bitcoin as a currency at the minute, if you were to ask people why they're buying bitcoins it's not to use it later on, it's to sell it for a different currency.

For anyone following this chain it's people trying to convince others/themselves that the coin they're invested in is going to be worth the most
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:54:25
Tfw you need a bank statement to send things in a currency to replace banks :(
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:32:10
You're right I wouldn't, but don't forget to buy at this new low! it's only gonna go up from here!
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:46:12
What's to stop this being used by people to fund terrorism anonymously without any risk of it being laid back to you, what happens when services such as the NHS fall over because we're all trading in an untaxed currency so there's no way to pay the staff?
Curious about this angle of it being "anonymous". Obviously I'd love to not be able to pay tax it's a pain, but I understand that it's probably needed.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:39:50
Quick, buy more this is just the dip! it's gonna sky rocket to at least $50,000 by the end of February. You can see it in the graphs this happens ALL the time just BUY BUY.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:32:39
Everything that is negative is FUD, anything that is positive/saying the price will rise is factual, I don't even have any bitcoins and I know how it works, geeeez.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:48:19
yeah it's only dropped a good 9 or so thousand dollars, nothing compared to 28
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:44:57
because of the correlation of this map and the map I saw on an earlier post, I can safely say that bitcoin will see $153,420 in the next 12 months. The internet grew and so will bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:10:43
You do realise if you bought 1 at 19k and you bought 1 at 28 you've lost a ton more.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:50:41
Are you trying to tell people to USE the currency as a currency?! Don't be silly, they're to be bought and sold to buy another currency to buy things...silly....
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:05:43
I do understand percentages but something going from 2 dollars to 28 is nowhere near as big as going from 10,000 to 19,000. Just because you say the percentages of it doesn't mean it's a good comparison.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:46:14
Just curious, but what makes you think going past 15k will make it alright? won't people just start selling when it goes back up to recoup losses when they bought in when it was 19k and everyone was saying it'll be 40k by the end of the month?
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:12:44
You might starve for a while if you don't use actual money
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:24:27
I'm not even gonna bother this entire sub-reddit is delusional. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:47:45
People selling it this low are losing out because when it takes over it'll be over 250k.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:40:53
Stick to being delusional. Bitcoin might take off as a thing but it's not going to be worth near what people are saying it's going to be worth, but hey the graphs say so, so to the moon I predict by the end of March they'll be AT LEAST $50,000 per coin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:06:39
So people spending 0.0000001 of a Bitcoin yo buy their dinner is the future?
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:37:13
What about the next day when that 0.000001BTC they payed for the meal becomes half of the price to recoup the costs of the meal so they lose money selling you it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:29:09
Because it would feel stupid, how much is that? oh it's a 1 fortieth of a btc mate
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:19
Fair point, but I see a lot of people investing in it and a very limited amount of posts about people actually spending it for it's intended use, people saying they're going to hold it for years to come till it's apparently going to be worth hundreds of thousands for 1 Bitcoin (apparently). Does this not go against what a currency is for?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:15:41
There's only 90k moving per day out of 15M and it's meant to be used as a currency not an investment, neat
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:10:31
You mean like probably a good majority of people who are buying it?
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:43:22
Do you turn the channel when these TV "Experts" are saying that bitcoin will only grow?
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:12:35
Then 20k shortly after that, followed quickly by 45k, then 75k and up to 100k by mid March.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:47:40
Spouting FUD like this is the reason why BTC has fallen.
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:03:21
Maybe I'm not built for accounting but I see it as literally creating money, i can mine a Bitcoin, sell it to you and we can both go buy the same item, the money you paid me was already in circulation and the Bitcoin you paid with has been added 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:40:26
How does it differ from Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:33:55
No but what I'm saying is Bitcoin come from nothing, and are 'worth' say $10,000 with of goods, that seems like it's just injected $10,000 into the economy in the same way that printing another $10,000 would 
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:29:46
You mean 8 digits? the price will boom to AT LEAST a million per coin this year. Just look at the amount left, once the none-coiners realise they're about to miss out on the future they'll pile all of their assets into it, trust me I've seen this before when it went from 2$ to 28$, it'll happen.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:08:00
$50,000? It's went from nothing to $7000, that's a 7000x increase, if we follow this trend in 10 years 1 coin will be $49,000,000, experts say.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:15:26
Keep calm and buy the dip, it's free money.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:45:12
Sorry for all the questions just trying to figure out how it's going to be apparently better than the already established currencies. Bitcoin just seem like a way for people to get rich quick (previously), buy drugs/weapons or launder large amounts of money.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:42:13
It's not about making profit out of it, it's about investing in technology and the future. You haven't bought a stock, you've exchanged your old, out of date currency for a new one. Isn't that what bitcoins all about?
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:47:28
What's going to 50k going to be? another correction or just another bubble that'll need correcting?
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:40:23
So what you're saying is there's never going to be a stable value of bitcoins? So people are going to be scared to spend it in case they're losing out on money?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:29:16
Just buy and HODL and we'll be at the moon in a month. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:32:54
But am I not right that it's essentiall printing money?
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:23:29
Yes, this may be true (not sure I've ever actually tried to spend euros in a shop) but even if it only fluctuates a little it's still enough to put business owners off in my opinion. But what you're saying is someone pays in bitcoin and you have to instantly convert it back to whatever currency you want, what's the point in it when you can just pay in the currency anyway?
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:42:59
Did anyone expect 20k to 5k in 2018?
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:02:55
I feel like bitcoins is just like creating money out of thing air. You mine a coin for free, then someone pays $10,000 for it, you now have one person with $10,000 and one person with a coin that's apparently worth $10,000. Is that not going to create inflation?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:18:36
It's not a none analysis, it started at next to nothing now it's $10,000 why can't it go to $250,000? what's stopping it? It's going to replace EVERY currency.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:42:24
You're saying bitcoin always goes back up, but then it always crashes again, seems stable. The more expensive it gets the less likely people are to get into it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:10:47
Yes donations are good and all, but the whole point of it as far as I understand isn't to make large donations 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:03:30
Because it's happened before and will happen again invest everything you can afford to lose in it, this is the FUTURE, it's only dropped this low because of people slandering it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:52:08
Bet people thought MySpace and Bebo wouldn't hit the shitter either because of how popular and new they were. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:28:44
How do they work? The pound Stirling doesn't go from £1 to £19, then back down to being worth £1 within a couple of months.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:57:06
There's always a dip this time of year, I predict £25k in the next few days BUY in this dip.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:16:03
So how do people expect bitcoin to work? One day it's worth $13,000 the next day it's worth $7,000 and then the day after that it could be $100, what's the incentive for people to start selling their products for bitcoin over a stable currency which has been established and works perfectly fine. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:35:26
I still thinking until it actually settles to a point where it isn't moving thousands up or down a week/day it's just not going to be a viable currency for people to actually use and I just can't see it happening any time soon. With people saying it's going to the moon! it'll be 100k by December 2018! they should be hoping it stabilizes at any number and sits at it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:49:22
We've seen this before, I predict BTC will go to £25,000 in the next month or two.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:00:34
"he world will go digital currency over the next 1-2 years." - No it won't.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:10:08
So why do I hear these "HODLers" talking about it in terms of USD? They've transferred their wealth to a different currency it shouldn't matter what it is in terms of other currencies, they're in a new currency, the future, they're true pioneers but instead they're obsessed about crashes and rises when they should be obsessed with being able to go to a shop and spend it on things, which I guarantee almost none of them will do because "it could go back to $20,000!".
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:55:42
Why would you ever convert BTC back into USD when it's only every going to succeed and is the future of currency, morons. Sick of people comparing it to fiat when 1 BTC == 1BTC.

@_date: 2018-02-06 11:50:00
But people keep referring to crashes which seem to happen very often, if the pound every couple of years was to crash to being worth 10p it wouldn't really fly with the general population.

Is that not what a good 99% of people who have bitcoins see it as? I see a lot of people talking about the price of it in terms of USD and not many people talking about buying stuff with it
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:34:03
What happens when all 21 million of the coins are used, and people hold onto them because they're going to be worth more and people are scared to lose money?
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:50:10
People should be wanting to buy it because it's the future of technology and want to contribute to growing it as an economy, but people seem to be buying it, to hold it, to sell it again for another currency.

I agree, we could be seeing highs of between $1,400,000 and $1,700,000 says Daily Mail reader who remortgaged his house to buy into bitcoin at an ATH without his wife knowing, he says he has 100% faith in the coin getting to these values.
