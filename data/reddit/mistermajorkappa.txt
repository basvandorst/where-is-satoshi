Your post history really tells a story:
r/drugs 
r/drunk 
r/depression 
r/tooafraidtoask (where you ask if sex between two people on drugs is consensual)
We get it, you’re a cool guy who can talk out of his ass.

Let’s see how it turns out for you. I bet you won’t invest everything you own into it. Bet

I will personally sell my bc at a loss if it breaks 100k bud

THEN WHERE DO YOU PUT THE MONEY YOU CAN’T AFFORD TO LOSE? LOOOOOOL.
Your argument is so backwards it’s like I’m talking to a living logic error. 
Cash? No it’s doomed to crash some day...
Bitcoin? Yeah, my kids won’t be able to each everyday, but hey, I might be able to buy a lambo with the next ath.

Bitcoin is a rally coin, of course it’s going to maintain some of its value...
What even is your idea of a recovery? Half it’s ath value? A quarter? A fifth? If it can’t maintain a set value for more than year, I’d say Bitcoin has no base to recovery to. I would say, however, that it is developing is base right about now, unless it jumps up again and dies down.

I was completely expecting “and unlike gold, it holds its value”, but that would be a lie.
Also, you could argue gold has about as much utility as bitcoin given that it hasn’t caught on for mainstream companies.

It he’s willing to invest in a deflated currency, then yes.
