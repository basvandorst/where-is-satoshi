That was one of the worst crypto-analysis articles I've ever read. It was nothing but basic economic fluff for 10,000 characters that had maybe 1 paragraph to do with PoS. I saw nothing about security flaws, and everything written about how Proof of Stake *must* waste as much energy as Proof of Work was because of "the free market".  
  
Proof of Stake uses a fixed, low amount of electricity, and if you want to refute that I would appreciate a technical article, not an economic one. That would be hard to do, of course, because PoS exists right now in the wild and uses demonstrably less energy than any other PoW coin
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:53:27
Yeah but there are better models for security that produce virtually no waste, like Proof of Stake. So it *is* actually a waste

I never said that. I'm discouraging rent-seeking.  
  
Ah well, it doesn't really matter anyway. Once Rootstock is fully developed someone will immediately fork it so it has a 0% fee instead of a 20% fee, and that will be the one used. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:09:58
Whenever an ETH contract is executed, 0% of the transaction fee goes to the Ethereum foundation.  
  
Whenever a BTC transaction goes through, 0% of the transaction fee goes to Satoshi.  
  
There's not a single coin I can think of that charges a percentage of the transaction fee to a central authority other than RootStock. That's *advanced* rentseeking

You know stocks are backed by businesses, right? They're not just magic wavy lines.  
  
Even if literally zero gen Z kids buy stocks in their entire life, stocks will still retain value because companies will buy back the stocks if they see them as undervalued.  
  
You're trying to fit the speculative ideas behind Bitcoin onto real backed assets.  
  
The ONLY time this "buy this asset to pay for my retirement" schtick makes any sense is for assets that have no inherent value, like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-13 05:53:50
You seem to not understand the difference between an unbacked asset and a company.  
  
In one category we have things like fiat currency, bitcoin, and collectors items. Their worth is dependent on making people believe that others want to buy it, so if the general public says something like "I don't like Bitcoin" or "I don't like beanie babies" then the value of said commodity will crash.  
  
In another category we have things like factories, industrial materials, and stocks. Their worth is dependent on being able to produce something valuable, and is not impacted by public opinion. If the general public says "I don't like Oil Rigs" or "I don't like Nestle" then fuck all will happen to the value, because anyone selling stock due to moral or philosophical issues will see their shares quickly bought up by someone more rational.  
  
Corporations have inherent value. They produce things and make money. If you think that's worthless then it's your loss.

They went bankrupt because they leveraged extreme amounts of debt and couldn't pay it back. When a company goes bankrupt, its stock price naturally goes down the toilet.

A fee doesn't represent an exact transaction speed, but a distribution of possible speeds. It's why [this transaction speed tracker]( lists a 90% range instead of an average.  
  
Unless you consistently make low fee transactions and consistently get them confirmed within 1 block, I'm gonna assume that you made a 1 in 100 transaction.

If Bitcoin doesn't adopt 2MB it's by design, and if it does it's also by design. It's easy to think that because events unfolded like they did, they were intended to.  
  
Bitcoin currently has a median transaction fee of $3 and an average transaction fee of $8. If you want your money transferred in 30 minutes you have to pay more. Bitcoin used to be the cryptocurrency of the masses, but I've slowly seen Bitcoin talked about as less of a 'currency' that's supposed to be traded and more as a 'store of value' that nobody should move, and the reason that is is because the network can only handle 3 transactions per second, not nearly enough to satisfy even a small town.  
  
Bitcoin needs to scale, and there are very easy ways to do so.

The people who think it's overvalued. Some people don't believe in main-stream cryptocurrency adoption or think the one that reaches mainstream appeal will be another coin.  
  
I personally have doubts about Bitcoin's off-chain scaling solutions, but I'm not an idiot so I'm not shorting a cryptocurrency

Bitcoin moving from $1 to $10 is way less significant than moving from $10000 to $100000, because one is a few new nerds discovering an internet coin and another is a movement of cash equivalent to an entire country giving up their currency in favor of Bitcoin.  
  
Yet in a log scale they're depicted the same. Theoretically, if you use a log scale you can show an infinitely high graph between Bitcoin being worth 0 and bitcoin being worth $0.01

Literally the only notable things LTC has that's different from bitcoin is a shorter block time and excellent marketing. You all call Bcash claiming the Bitcoin title a scam to trick newbies, but Litecoin has been calling itself "The silver to Bitcoin's gold" since 2011 even though that makes no sense from a technological perspective and they're not tied to eachother in any meaningful way.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:58:56
It would *stop* the network, including block rewards, for as long as the attacker has a majority of the hashrate. If this were to happen for more than 24 hours, any rational for-profit miner will turn off their machines to save electricity, due to no block reward. After that point, the attacker could maintain their majority far more easily, holding the network completely hostage until the bitcoin value drops to 0 for obvious reasons (Not that anyone can actually buy or sell bitcoins anyway, this is all on exchanges)

No, I mean bitcoin can't become mainstream because it can't handle the transaction volume of 300 million people paying rent once a month.  
  
In fact, assuming bitcoin is adopted by 300 million people, bitcoin has the transaction rate for the average person to pay for something no less than once every 3.17 years.  
  
If bitcoin becomes a worldwide currency, the average person can pay for something once every 74 years. Talk about a once-in-a-lifetime purchase!

Transaction speed is proportionally based on block size. That is an inherent fact of the bitcoin blockchain that will never go away.  
  
Current speed of transactions is [2.8 per second](  
  
Visa, the current dominant credit card company, is responsible for [1,971 transactions per second](  
  
so, in order to properly handle all those transactions, you will need a block size of 1 MB * (1,971 / 2.8), or 703 MB.  
  
Considering Bitcoin miners have heavily resisted even moving to 2 MB, I'm not gonna hold my breath
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:55:45
