Hi Isokivi, Jerrold here (the CTO of CoinJar).  I've just tried to do the same on my end and can't seem to reproduce.  I was just wondering, were you logged in via Facebook or using an email account?  Oh and if you can attach a screen shot of the error (maybe via imgur?) that would help us a lot.

Hi  Jerrold here from CoinJar.  Thanks for the suggestion, we'll look into fixing that as soon as possible.

Thanks Isokovi, we've got the logs for that and we're fixing it now

I've just had a quick look at your site and it looks interesting.  What is your different angle if you don't mind me asking :) ?
If you'd like to shoot me an email no worries.  I'm just at my first name, at coinjar.io

I'm at a Bitcoin startup myself, and our stack is created on RoR (   Though I'm not traditionally from a Rails background, I've really grown to love it.
The language isn't as clean as Python, nor the performance as good as Java (both what I specialise in) though the thing that really converted me was the giant collection of Ruby Gems, which significantly speeds up development.  Whatever we seem to be doing, a quick google almost always reveals a Gem for it, and this not only reduces our bug count (as we're not writing something from scratch but using something that has been tried and tested by the community) we can get features out into the hands of our users and see if they like it before committing to put more work into it. 
This goes well into the topic of scaling as scaling is a hard problem, and shouldn't be the first thing you work on.  The first thing should be is finding out if this is something people want, and the quicker you find that out, the quicker you can decide if you want to spend more time on it, e.g. time meaning working on the difficult problem of scaling. 
In terms of security, I'd say it's more secure if you use a Gem than writing your own code from scratch.  I know a bit about security, but I'm by no means a security expert, and I'd rather trust a project which has been tried and tested by a large community, with people who have more experience than I do in this, than rely on my own wit and cunning.  
Of course they are exceptions to all of this, though I've found currently, RoR and the community has a nice balance between everything I'm after in building software.

Hi psyberwolf, yep I think I've also replied to you though our support system though you're not the first person who has mentioned this confusion.  We're updating the site now to make it clearer when you do and don't have to type in your 2FA code.

Thanks TenshiS!  Our tech stack is nothing fancy.  Just a regular RoR application, currently sitting on Heroku.  The location tags sound like a good idea, especially to know where stores will ship items to!
