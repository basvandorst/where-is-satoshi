I promise I'll make a good universe.

Thanks for the link.
Edit: Watched. I think, to be contrary, that the technical expert owns shares in green ink, and despite other technical experts saying that, no, he is indeed holding a red pen, the green-ink company man says he needs to use green ink and that red ink is dangerous, irresponsible, and impossible. This is the problem. Then he kicks the people who are saying his red pen is red out of the room, and threatening to change from pens to pencils, while now claiming red pens aren't actually pens at all.  Meanwhile a red ink specialist had a tantrum and stormed out of the room, saying that all ink is done for, and other people believed him for three days but then bought pens again. 
It would be possible to talk more about whether the ink was green or red, and which ink is the best, and how and when the red or green pen should be used, but anyone outside the room who suggests anything other than a green pen gets swarmed by angry bees. Plenty of other office people don't even know that there is a pen argument going on because any evidence of the meetings even happening is largely redacted. Red pen enthusiasts and green pen enthusiasts both like pens in principle. Meanwhile a paperclip salesman has been emailing everyone in the office that pens are over, and that they should buy paperclips. 
Other people in the office are beginning to believe that both the green ink people and the red ink people both work for Sharpie, and are quitting to go work with typewriters. 
Not that a table of idiots wants red ink but it is actually green ink. It really isn't so simple.

Yes, of course. There is a highly technical component to the whole thing, but the problems now are not derived purely from technical shortcomings.

Mmm kool-aid.

I'm going to build a computer from scratch, and an operating system from scratch, and then a Bitcoin client from scratch. Can't trust just anybody.

Your view isn't wrong, but respectfully, is limited. No offense intended. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:41:54
Thanks for your technically robust analysis.

MY HERO IS BETTER THAN YOUR HERO
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:57:09
I'll let you know how it goes!
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:22:06
How does that compare to storj or maidsafe?
@_date: 2016-01-14 01:31:54
Don't give them ideas. :P

I am not a consumer, I am an investor. Investors usually direct policy in large organizations.
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:36:55
Which ones?
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:01:50
I don't have heroes. They're all people, at best, or corrupt losers at worst. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 06:20:49
I see what you did there. Lol
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:23:42
After you, boss.
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:01:17
I might fire the coaches. So your counter example isn't that persuasive.
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:53:56
This whole post is a circlejerk _at least as bad_ as any that have been mentioned in any of your loathed "alt-coin" subreddits. 
Could it be that there is truth to both sides of the story? 
Could it be that smart people who aren't you geniuses are opposed to Blockstream etc., because of valid reasons, and not because they're idiots, trolls, paid shills, or sock puppets?
Of course. The same goes for many of you here when framed on those alt-subs. 
Maybe it isn't about shills and trolls. Maybe some of you want a low capacity network because you think it is most like digital gold. Maybe you think side chains are preferable to on-chain, and you have your reasons. 
Maybe this has more to do with competing values than a troll fight (though there are a lot of those).
And, maybe that's why there are alternative implementations trying for dominance.

I am not a programmer. But Bitcoin isn't _primarily_ suffering from technical problems. Rather, they are rooted in categories such as 'governance', 'vision', 'implementation', and so forth. Investors don't need to be technical experts to understand summaries, testing outcomes, or see their own vested interests.

You have more time for wells once there is a roof over your head at night.

Man I love _soar_ grapes.

People do. You could go ten years before being awarded a block reward.

I find it amusing that the person who forked Bitcoin so hard it turned in to Litecoin is saying this. ^^

This coin's not big enough for the both of us then, padre.
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:11:58
That's not how _any_ of this works.
@_date: 2016-02-02 22:45:06
And well intentioned people on both "sides".

And if it doesn't, others will sell. Get over it.

Who doesn't like to spend more money on stuff? 
I know if I can spend more, I do 100% of the time. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 06:15:26
Not really.
