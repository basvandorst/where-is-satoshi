Please add Ally Financial to your list of working banks!! I know you get requests all the time but I am chomping at the bit to use this app.

First off, welcome to Bitcoin! There's a lot going on under the hood, so don't stress out about a lot of the details. 
I use circle.com for purchasing Bitcoin. Download the app, sign up for an account, and you can use a debit card to have coins sent to your Mycelium address. 
~~Coinbase.com is another option, although those accounts come with their own addresses. Both are considered trustworthy ways to purchase your first Bitcoin.~~
Edit: Alright alright I get it. Just wanted to give my opinion on which are the easiest ways to obtain your first bit of Bitcoin. Just wanted to give them a place to start.

C'mon Saywooot. Don't take the easy way out. Take pride in your work. At least polish up your FUD a bit before you bring it here. Maybe buy it a new pair of sneakers.

Oh dam. BRB selling.

He's not wrong. Previewing videos has streamlined my fapping experience.

Why is this post showing near the top of /new/ if it was posted 5 hours ago?

Kind of hard to speculate when we don't have any other information. How did you get this? What channel was this through? Etc

Here's a tutorial on how to do it with BCash. Same rules apply for the Segwit2x fork:

Everyone needs to check out purse.io. I've been using it for well over two years to buy stuff off Amazon.
You place an order with bitcoin, name what you want added to your cart, put it out there for someone to purchase with their money or Amazon credit. You get the items shipped, and they get the Bitcoin.

I didn't see an address anywhere on his page. Oh well.

Might be tonight. BTC just dropped from $8,000 to $7,880 in a matter of minutes

I would move it off the exchange completely onto a mobile wallet where you can access your keys. That way you can get the segwit2x coins IMMEDIATELY.

I had this error today trying to make a purchase off CryptoThrift. I tried sending bitcoin two more times to the QR code because I thought it didn't go through. About 5 minutes later all three posted to Mycellium but only one got through. 
Waiting it out for a bit might be the solution here. Expect this kind of thing across most payment sites.

You heard it here first, folks.

About number two, aren't paper wallets good for one withdrawal? I've always been told to withdraw the full amount.

I use a label maker to print my keys and put them on a piece of paper. No internal memory to worry about and the ink will last a long time.
