It's a low risk coin . I doubt Bitcoin is going to drop to $2 . Even when there are dips , BTC always recovers .
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:34:08
Big things are coming for eos.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:03:34
My condolences to you and your family.
There are a few tutorials that you can find on accessing your funds on the Ledger Nano S. 
PLEASE DO NOT REVEAL THOSE WORDS because its used to recover your account.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:04:13
HODL strong. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:43:33
I've made a decent return on my eos investment so far. It can only go up from here.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:21:15
Why wouldn't you buy btc?
Btc is a safe investment.

Any crypto currency that guarantees you 2000% profits is already a red flag. I don't know whether the users who commented on this post are being sarcastic or not. If you are being serious I suggest you look for another hobby.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:38:53
Yes ETH too.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:55:19
Bitstamp is a good exchange to use.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:55:21
It never use to be like this though. The network just can't handle so much traffic , no one expected bitcoin to be this big. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:45:23
If I'm not mistaken Electrum has this feature , it's worth checking out.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:41:46
That won't even cover the transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:28:53
Remember you don't actually have the bitcoin stored in your wallet ..they are stored in a block and you only have access to it with your keys.
So there is no way you can avoid the blockchain because that's where your money actually is.

Nano S ledger is a good hardware wallet to keep your crypto on. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:58:08
Why you *
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:32:43
Who in their right mind would do this though. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:48:53
Yes it is much easier than a paper wallet because you don't need to input your Private key , only need to input your pin to send your funds.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:33:35
HODL for life.
All about those gains boys.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:30:24
We all have to start somewhere and having a few coins make up your portfolio is good because it minimizes your risk.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:23:38
That will soon change.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:39:44
BTC's network has been experiencing very high traffic and as a result the Transaction fees are so damn high. There is no way you can really avoid this if you want to stay in BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:15:46
Having your investment kept on a hardware wallet is the safest route to go.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:02:21
It's expensive but rather be safe than sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:19:53
You can use a desktop wallet but it is vulnerable to malware .  A hardware wallet is much more secure and you have control of your private key. 
Trezor and Ledger Nano S is the most popular HW wallets on the market .
I would recommend Ledger Nano S because it supports a lot more crypto currencies than Trezor.
If you are worried that the HW wallet might break , you receive a seed when setting up your HW wallet for the first time which you can use to restore your wallet if anything should happen.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:30:52
The Ledger Nano S is a good pick. I'm currently using this wallet and have had no issues so far.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:46:51
A hardware wallet is the safest route to go because when used on a computer you don't need to input your private key , only your pin code which makes it most secure.
If you are worried about the Device breaking , you receive a seed when setting up your device for the first time which can be used to restore your wallet.
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:55:50
and that?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:25:52
I suggest you use Coin base its very well known.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:16:53
How did you acquire these bitcoins OP?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:08:57
They are upset because it is really not a good move , I'm not attacking you but i will tell you why i say that...
For so long the market has just been rising and rising , especially bitcoin . This bleeding in the market is only natural and is healthy. Eventually the price of bitcoin will rise again and even higher than before... It has happened so many times and that is the crypto life. People with weak hands lose and the rest of us HODLERS make so much off it.

There is no way you can avoid the transaction fees buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:01:10
No problem man.

It's like taking candy from a baby.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:20:38
The Funds will be automatically sent to your account OP.
I suggest you do research on bitcoin and get familiar with the technology and this will help you make better decisions with your investments in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:52:50
The Ledger Nano S is a good hardware wallet and it supports A lot more alt coins than the Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:13:32
Mining bitcoin use to be profitable years ago but you should look into mining alt coins , you will make a higher ROI with mining alt coins.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:21:22
This is going to make a lot of people happy.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:06:30
I would recommend the Ledger Nano S.

The Ledger Nano S is a good Hardware wallet.

I am just nervous about the USB breaking.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:54:38
The Ledger Nano S is popular because it supports more alt coins than the Trezor does.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:20:27
Bitcoin can no longer be used as a currency because of the high traffic that is on the network. It is just too mainstream and its affecting everyone that is trying to use it as a currency. Bitcoin is worth HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:33:51
The Ledger Nano S is a good hardware wallet to use.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:46:32
Ledger Nano S HW wallet supports a lot of coins.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:46:17
That's why its the best route to go to store your funds if you own large amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:31:22
So many people have made thousands off of bitcoin the last few weeks. When everyone's nans are investing in bitcoin the rich just get richer.

Bitcoin will not be failing anytime soon .

To the moon boys!
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:26:04
For what you want to do I would recommend you use Ripple to send and receive funds for day to day use. The transaction fees are low and transaction time is not a day.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:42:01
The Ledger Nano S supports a lot of the crypto currencies on the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:19:42
Hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S is the safest route to go because you never have to input your private key on your computer . If anything should happen to your Ledger , you receive a seed when setting up your wallet for the first time and this will restore your wallet.
A paper wallet is a piece of paper that contains your address and private key . If the device that you are using to access you funds is compromised , your currency is vulnerable .
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:31:46
If you are using MEW with your Ledger then you shouldn't have a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:37:09
I would recommend Ledger Nano S.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:24:51
Unfortunately there is no way you can avoid these crazy transaction fees.

Bitcoin transactions are very high and you cant make as much money as you could with a fraction of a bitcoin . 
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:28:32
I know all about EOS. I'm an early investor FYI.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:27:16
EOS definitely has the potential but as of now you can't make claims that EOS is better because they have no working product out yet. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:43:58
Good choice , The Ledger Nano S has more support for alt coins than a HW wallet like Trezor.
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:23:26
LOL. Good on you.
@_date: 2018-03-08 07:41:06
I can vouch for this. The ledger is a far better choice if you hodl mainly alt coins.
