A lot of people auto sell when the market starts to go down causing a bigger slide. They move to stable coins. I personally don't trust stable coins because I don't control them and they are mostly faith-based. USDT is a good example. I just don't know how it works behind the scenes. 
When the market slides it's my buy time.

I paid -0.00000488 to send 0.01537186 BTC was that enough? I don't understand when I send it should broadcast it. I don't see how bitcoin not working is my fault.

The smart play would be to hold. However, once the price slides it's off to the races to sell as fast as possible. Now the people that are getting the BTC back are early adopters so they may collectively hold.

If this isn't a joke and you did any research at all you would know this isn't possible. There is a thing called chargebacks that prevent this from happening.

I am thinking it will start to drop sometime before that date. Some people will want out early. Some will HOLDL until the prices starts correcting. Then it will be a flood. That or it will keep rising. I am guessing it won't.

How does it work. I open an account. Call them on the phone. Order a contract for 12k for June and see if someone else wants to buy it? Do I purchase someone else's contract already written? How do the two parties meet each other?

My advice is to start small and learn the ropes. Use a personal computer and mine on nicehash for example. Then mine some alt coins. You need to have knowledge before investing a lot of cash. Mining has become a very hard for a novice to determine if it will pay. I see so many BS mining sales pitches. If you need help message me.

Not true. If china were to ban mining we would still be able to mine without China or their fancy miners. The difficulty would automatically adjust. Some other company would step in to make miners.

I don't get it. If they have the bitcoins why are they not just giving back the bitcoins? After all, they are not their bitcoins they belong to the customers.

Just take away fiat money creation from the banks. They will have to go back to traditional banking where the government didn't guarantee their losses.

I am sure that will happen at some point. Savings and investing banks should be separate banks and not guaranteed by the government. They may forget hundreds of years of banking practices in the blink of any eye.

It is possible. Many banks are running in-house Ethereum blockchains. They won't touch Bitcoin with a ten-foot pole. I can't predict the future but I am betting on Ethereum for now.

Fewer miners = less difficulty to mine. So if the coin loses value and giant mining farms are not profitable they go out of business and smaller operations take over.
