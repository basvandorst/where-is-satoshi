They froze her account because she *wasn't* paying. Getting to the frozen accounts point requires repeatedly ignoring polite letters, non-polite letters, phone calls, "we're gonna sue" letters, and full-on court proceedings.

It'll probably be bought using a prepaid Visa purchased in cash from a gas station.

OK, so please inform me which country permits account freezing as a *first* step to debt collection (and just on the say-so of a random debt collector without a court order), so I can never go there?

Frozen bank accounts probably mean they *did* sue her, and successfully.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:10:13
In all likelihood, she doesn't have access to her money because a court ordered that the accounts be frozen as the result of a judgement.
That's intended to get her attention (successfully, it seems!) in a way that repeated calls, letters, and probably literal process servers showing up on the doorstep haven't done.
If she didn't have friends to help pay for it, she'd have to go to court or reach out to the creditor (who I *guarantee* has given her their contact information, repeatedly) to negotiate next steps. After a few weeks of non-payment, the creditor would proceed to get the court to let them take the funds they're owed.
Ignoring "you've been sued and a default judgement was issued" doesn't work. This is what happens when you do.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:46:39
So you're asserting that there's a country in the European Union that lets me call a bank and say "so-and-so owes me money" and they'll just freeze their  account on that authority?
I *highly* doubt that.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:15:24
In a mad world, the mad are *extra* off-kilter.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:50:57
There's almost certainly a waiting period before they can go ahead and take what's owed from the frozen accounts. This is literally *for her protection* - it gives her the chance to challenge the freeze with the legal system.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:01:51
Sure, and it's just as easy for the court to say "bullshit, you put money in it recently and it's worth a million bucks, we don't believe you, go to jail for contempt of court".
It's also easy to keep an eye on your spending and lifestyle for the next 20 years and bring the court's attention to the mansion and sports car that materialized out of nowhere.

Large cash withdrawals will be a massive red flag for the spouse's divorce lawyer, and OP would have to convincingly account for how it was spent.
"I gave it to charity but forgot to get a receipt" won't do the trick.
There are thousands of ways to get caught *and you only have to screw up one of them*.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:00:36
This is one of those cases where the risk/reward balance isn't great.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:49:55
It's pretty routine to review tax returns, bank statements, etc.
Unless you've got a secret, under-the-table job your spouse doesn't know about, it's going to be extremely hard to pull "oh yeah I withdrew $50k in cash and then... lost it?" sort of bullshit.
If your spouse doesn't have a lawyer, you might have a chance. Otherwise, *your* lawyer isn't going to risk their license to help you hide assets, and *spouse's* lawyer is going to know all the usual tricks and how to expose them.

I'm old enough to remember people talking about how awesome Bitcoin was because you could cut out the credit card companies and their *exorbitant* middleman rates.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:05:25


Considering OP has already left an online trail confessing to a crime, OP is *demonstrably* not competent of successfully pulling off something the legal system is very good at catching.


If you claim to have lost it at the casino, you will be asked why you never [claimed those gambling losses on your taxes]( and be fucked (or get Capone-style fucked by the IRS for fraudulently claiming them). The casino might wind up subpoenaed for their records of your wins/losses (which they *will* have). etc. etc. etc.


What's the point of hiding a couple hundred bucks?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:19
The legal system is quite good at finding squirreled-away money of this sort, especially when it's post-income squirreling as it leaves an enormous paper trail. There's a very good chance of getting caught, and that can easily result in jail time or a very, very nasty divorce settlement.
@_date: 2015-01-17 15:52:17
It's basically a drastically sped-up simulation of the early days of the financial system.

An "ongoing official investigation" would hardly be surprising info.

A Ponzi collapses when not enough people are putting money *in* to cover the people taking money *out*. If Bitfinex is secretly insolvent, an inability to take *deposits* will mean they'll run out of money more quickly to cover *withdrawals*.
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:42:56
If my bank randomly stopped accepting deposits or took weeks/months to allow me to withdraw from the ATM, I'd probably be *speculating* pretty damn hard about their solvency. Wouldn't you?
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:00:44
Sorry, what's the cause, and how'd you find out?
Their social media team says ["I am waiting for more information myself as it hasn't reached the social media team yet."](
Their announcements page doesn't even mention the hold: 
Nothing on their Twitter, either:

Repeated bank hopping (ING, Wells Fargo, Noble, HSBC; maybe others, I'm not sure). Their latest account only lasted a week, leading to this deposit suspension.
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:05:35
Gox didn't have the regulatory attention today's exchanges do.
There's a lot of speculation that Bitfinex's bank-hopping is due to accounts being seized. If that's the case, a significant amount of fiat may be tied up in such accounts.
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:09:43
I like that the graphic makes no allowance for both tokens dropping.

This didn't age well.




@_date: 2018-10-11 23:38:43
That's an absurdly dumb reading of my statement. No, I haven't made any statement that can be *remotely* read to mean that.
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:23:23
A closed fund can make payouts and be solvent, as they hold enough assets to pay all their liabilities. If everyone demands a payout at once, they can pay it out successfully and close the fund.
A Ponzi can make payouts (as long as there's enough coming in to offset it) and be insolvent, because they fundamentally can't pay *all* the liabilities they have on the books. If everyone (or even a decent percentage) wants their money out at once, the Ponzi collapses and reveals it never had the money it was supposed to.
A Ponzi holds, say, $100M in assets, but tells 100 people their investments are each worth *$5M* due to their magic 500% returns trading strategy or whatever they've picked as their scam. If 20 people take their money out, no one suspects a thing... but if a 21st person wants their money out, the Ponzi (and the 80 people who haven't gotten their imaginary $5M out) is done for.
@_date: 2018-10-11 18:05:59
I would not conflate being insolvent with "fractional reserve".
My personal suspicion is they've had various accounts seized, leaving significant portions of their fiat holdings inaccessible to them. There are folks in begging for info on months-old wire transfers ([example a]( [example b]( with weeks worth of Bitfinex's Reddit staff going "I'll look into that for you".
@_date: 2018-10-12 13:18:57
I don't think they're a classic Ponzi. I do suspect they may be insolvent, and as such I wouldn't keep any money with them. You can be insolvent without running a Ponzi.
@_date: 2018-10-11 21:06:20
C'mon, Bernie Madoff managed to pay out withdrawals for *decades*. He was still insolvent.
"Withdrawals are not affected", says the same moderator telling someone their missing $30k means "fiat finance at Bitfinex is working just fine". 
This guy's been begging for their £25k for five months now, with responses like "our colleagues have not forgotten about your case". 
You claimed Bitfinex not accepting deposits was FUD, but it's been confirmed by Bitfinex staff. You'll have to excuse me not taking your claims of FUD at face value.

You might find the IRS treats losing your secret as being akin to this:




@_date: 2019-02-24 14:02:16
Seems like that'd be even worse.
"I know this looks like an empty field, but trust me, there's actually an invisible barn full of very valuable cows I can't use anymore. Please let me have a bunch of money as a result."
@_date: 2019-02-23 16:16:49
The problem here, though, is the barn is still *there*, and the IRS can see the cows inside milling around safely. It's just protected by an energy shield, which the IRS has reason to believe you *may* be the only one able to control.
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:02:41
You're just restating my point, really.
The IRS will frown on your example "I took some money out and then lost it" deduction, too.

I mean, they sent her to WU first. Presumably when that failed they went to plan B.

This is probably one of the "I'm your grandkid and I'm stuck in a foreign country send money" scams via a faked profile, then. Someone tried to pull it on my wife's grandmother; thankfully she was skeptical enough to ask some questions to the person posing as my BIL.
@_date: 2019-12-31 17:34:19
Or one of those "we recorded you watching your weird porn" ones.

Yes, and that includes the Chinese government, which has the literal power of life-or-death over them. If they decide they want to get rid of Bitcoin, they've got the governmental structure to just act, and quickly.
"Do this or we'll execute you for money laundering" works wonders, and big Bitcoin mining ops are pretty easy to find. China's probably got a list compiled already.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:43:56
That's a hilariously silly argument.

Bitcoin is down 58.97% in the last month, per Coinbase, so the stock market gets a big ✅ for "more stable".

The USD is credible in part because the US government will go after anyone counterfeiting/bank robbing/etc. with all their power. No similar entity exists (or even can exist) for Bitcoin.
