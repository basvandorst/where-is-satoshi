You are exactly right, and you should have stopped right there. The rest of the post is a descent into hysterics.

Repeatedly calls it 'Bitcoins', and makes mention of 'Etherium'.

short squeeze

Good for the status quo. The market didn't seem to like what happened today.

You'll notice free space in blocks has increased dramatically of late, now that the flood of spam has suddenly stopped (once it looked like Segwit2x would be a go). The high fees and full blocks were engineered to reap some fat tx fees, and to make people say things like "Increasing the hard blocksize limit would be the simplest and quickest way to relieve fee pressure".

Other way around. Bitcoin is falling and the alts are falling with it. As much as some of the alts like to claim they could replace Bitcoin, they're still traded mostly to acquire more Bitcoin.

Segwit2x was deployed earlier today on testnet and shit the bed. Segwit2x devs say it was all part of the plan. Either way, the market is a bit spooked.

The timeline also matches up with the deteriorating health and eventual death of David Kleiman, a long-time collaborator with Craig Wright.
