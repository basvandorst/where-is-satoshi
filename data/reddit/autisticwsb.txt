Would this setup not work:
Buy crypto on a kyc platform. Move it to a non-custodial wallet that does not have kyc. Sell the coins I bought and buy new coins on that platform. Move those coins to another non-custodial non-kyc wallet. Again sell the coins and buy new coins on that wallet.

Well I'm thinking the steps in between will yield coins that cannot be linked to me.
Another question, how do cryptocurrency funds/persons report their taxes? Can you file for losses if you are losing if they can't be tracked to you?

What is a reliable platform that someone from the usa can you use to buy crypto without it linked to me? And then I can move it to a wallet after

Oh I see. So the coins will always be linked to my name unless I use a non-kyc exchange. 
Can you recommend any? Or describe how this can be done while in the usa? Perhaps with a VPN?

I see. How is bitcoin not anonymous, I thought that was the whole thing: governments can't track it movement?
Do any of those wallets have an app? And in a non custodial wallet can you trade between several coins?

Thank you!

Interesting. Thank you for all this.
Okay so for tax purposes do I have to show all my trades? Or can I report losses/gains as they happened? Is there some kind of verification?

Are you on discord/know discords where I can talk this stuff through live. I think this whole thread has given me a really good idea of how these things work. I just want to walk through my plan and see if it's sensible. 
If you have discord and want to chat I can dm my user stuff? (Not trying to sell or buy anything just better to talk through my ideas and ensure they are sound)
