I just investigated gocelery.com and I love the interface! I verified and everything, but I was not credited with $5 upon completion. Do I have to do something further? Thanks.

Good to hear!
I found a bug, I think. I wandered around the interface and everything was fine, until I got to  where it shows I have 0 BTC. But, in the top left area, it shows $5 worth of BTC. So, the two areas are not in sync with one another.

Thanks, I see it.
As long as Celery is serious about security, I don't have any complaints so far. I've tried Coinbase too, but Celery was faster/easier to go through verification. Everything was instant and snappy, so great job. The fee could be more competitive, though (&lt; 1%) ;). But this is certainly a beautiful and worthy competitor to Coinbase (again assuming security is strongly emphasized). Great job so far... I'm surprised I've never heard about this before.

Got it, I see it too now. Yeah, more clarity would be good.
Another 'bug' is that going to the homepage appears to 'log out' of the account (since it says 'log in' at the top right), yet returning to the previous URL (the URL for the account) 'logs in'. In other words, it shows one logged out, despite one still being logged in. Instead of this behavior, going to the homepage should probably redirect automatically to the account page URL.
Or something else could be changed. Just make it more clear. On Coinbase, for example, going to the homepage will auto-redirect back to the account.
