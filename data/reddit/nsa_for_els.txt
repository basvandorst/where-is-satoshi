The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.

History suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom. Clearly it is not a sufficient condition.

Invention is continually exercised to furnish new pretenses for revenue and taxation. It watches prosperity as its prey and permits none to escape without a tribute.
