Is your wallet synced?

The extent of identification required depends on the country in which the ATM is located.

MMO currencies have real world value.  There are people around the world that farm WoW gold for a living, for example.  I sold a fair amount myself back in the day.  Integrating Bitcoin isn't a huge leap.  Hell, I'd rather farm gold for a living than flip burgers.

I use Steamloader all the time.  No bad experiences, but it can sometimes take a couple hours.

Use said currency you earn from sale of imaginary unicorn to buy burger :)   My point is that using widely adopted cryptocurrency in-game really isn't that different from using WoW gold or what have you.

Hm, do people only take cash deposits?  I was hoping for an easy electronic transfer, rather than having to drive to the bank and take pictures of the receipts and upload them etc.  If I have to I will, it's just certainly not my first choice.  Thanks for the link!
