True, so many bitch-made-ass internet toughguys here that love to imagine murdering a court justice when they couldn't even swat a fly.

Your post above literally shows the opposite conclusion.

I down voted you for using logic and reason to make a compelling argument.

Hopefully price goes down to $150 so we can stock up on cheap coins and get rich when it blasts back up to $1000.

Seen a chart in the past year? It's more like solidly downwards.

Everyone gets hacked at least once. It's ok it's just money. Just buy more 6 more and learn to have better security in the future.

Gold is actually desired though. Just go ask 100 people if they would rather have 1 ounce of gold or the equivalent value of Bitcoin. I'd wager atleast 95 would pick the gold because it's an actual desired commodity.

Most tobacco is not raised by U.S. farmers. There are a lot of Indian and Chinese labor slaves that do that, and tobacco is legal in those countries as far as I'm aware.

Mining in first world countries right now is a negative sum game when we talk about the scale of small mining hardware. The money spent on electricity does not allow to make a profit on the raw proceeds of mining. So there isn't any room to offer a real incentive to anyone.

Just do a comparison of market cap of bitcoin to gold and it isn't anywhere near apples to apples. There are people willing to pay top dollar for beanie babies but that doesn't mean they're actually worth anything as a commodity money like gold is.

Change the world by committing to being anally raped every day for the rest of your life in prison. Yeah I don't think that's worth it.

It actually is, by definition, money.

The regulations exist to protect the consumer, which is something I would expect from a modern civilized society. Most normal people (myself included) prefer that money transmitters are licensed than have a Wild West scenario where the money transmitter has liquidity issues and the money you gave them goes poof without recourse.

All cloud mining is a scam. No one will ever sell you access to a money printing machine when they can just use it themselves.

He is though. He's soon to be the richest man to ever live since he controls more coin than anyone else. Once Bitcoin is the world currency he will own something like 7% of all wealth and will be able to buy multiple entire countries.

Dishonest money transmitters harm their customers through an asymmetry of information that will always be intrinsically present in their business. That is why we have to make it illegal to do so without license.
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:55:47
No. He owns much more than that currently. In a hundred years though assuming he continues to not spend his coins he will own about 7%.
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:44:05
When bitcoin is used as the exclusive world currency, it will be equivalent. Since the only thing that can give a currency value is the economy and wealth behind it. Otherwise bitcoin would have zero value.
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:21:11
True, but in the case of Bitcoin it just keeps hitting low after low. See the parent comment for summary as to why.

I send you 1 bitcoin to hold for me. Weeks later you discover a bug in your system just sent my 1 bitcoin to one of Satoshi's addresses. When I come back to ask for my 1 bitcoin, it has 'poofed', no longer in your possession. Then you tell me "sorry for your loss".
