But market mechanisms is exactly what happened. A very small percentage of potential "investors" lost, the market destroyed the enterprise, and some sort of lesson has been learned. We have yet to see if improvements and efficiencies will result from this but my guess is transparency or self regulation will be a higher priority in the future.

Foreseeing such events are not necessarily part of market mechanisms. In particular when full information is not available. You are conflating the theory of perfect markets in which rational behavior, full transparency and no wrong doings are part of the equation.
In this case those elements were not present therefore the market participants acted in accordance with the available information, which resulted in a negative outcome for the participants.
Market mechanisms on the other hand are exactly what happened here, it is not a matter of debate, whether the market was perfect, or in this case not. The seller no longer provides a good value and has been eliminated from the market, a market mechanism.
Edit: In other words, a free market it may be but by no means was it a perfect market.

Q3 corporate taxes. $100B last year as well.

I'm not sure but perhaps it's because both normal quarterly estimated corporate tax payments and prior year tax extension deadlines fall on the same date in q3 every year.
