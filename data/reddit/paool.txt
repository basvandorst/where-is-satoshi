No, complexity is the product of 20 year old brogrammers. Crypto needs to be made simpler for the mainstream user, not more complicated by requiring them to run a LN node and understand the need for opening/closing payment channels.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:31:02
Why? Lightning not only works on the cash chain as well, it works *better* .
Plenty of space in blocks to open/close payment channels for &lt;$0.01. 
My last BTC TX was $20 at 200 sat/byte since I have a few inputs. Still took hours.

You're the thinking type. That's good. People had the same thought as you back in 2010.
Continue thinking and learn about Bitcoin from as much non-reddit sourced information as possible. 
ie nakamoto institute. 
Also read Satoshi's early emails with Mike Hearn. 
There is a coin that will represent all the principles that crypto currency was invented for. Time will tell whether that will be BTC. As someone who's been involved since 2009, I don't see how it will end up being BTC. Yes I'm well aware of LN.

No one who reads r\btc would refer to it as "bcash" . Dead give away.

Well none of those listed have a chance at dethroning BTC. Cash does. That's why people are very threatened by it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:18:52
I'm curious why you think that is. The reason segwit is preferred is because of malleability. Simply, the txid won't change for a sw transaction. 
Absolutely not required, but makes devs lives easier. 
But Bitcoin cash has fixed malleability since November
See 
BIP 0146
And do a search for malleability. 
So now that we know that Bitcoin cash transaction IDs won't change, and the costs of opening/closing a channel are cheaper, why do you think segwit is better?

Javascript is actually in demand now for good reason. Node.js is a powerful tool for specific applications and you no longer need to know 2 languages if you go the full JS stack. 
communicating between the front-end and back-end is simplified because its JSON both ways. 
I wish Bitcoin was written in JS, I'd be able to understand it a bit better.

I'm trying to build an address-less, one click button to purchase things.
It would require my server to generate a private key (encrypted of course), but it becomes vulnerable to hackers. And a lot of security knowledge on my part.
But let's say you had a small wallet, and came across an HD stream of a movie. Instead of paying a subscription and signing up, you could simply click a button and it would pay the micro-transaction and instantly you would be authenticated to stream the movie.

Hi, 
Pretty good execution so far.
Here is what I would want as a real-world example.
I am building a "forum" (basically reddit), and as simply as someone can upvote, I'd like to implement a one button tip for X amount of bits. 
so for me, If it was just a matter of sending a POST request (the users private key would be created/saved into my database), that would be ideal for myself as well as many other developers who are accustomed to RESTful APIs.

here's the same argument in a more understandable analogy.

@_date: 2017-08-02 05:34:16
I'm not defending the 30% number, but miners can easily double-dip.
Where do you think the hash rate came from today to mine over 12 blocks when it was estimated to take 3 days before the difficulty adjusted enough to mine a single block?
They just need to move a conservative percentage of their hash rate.

You can't just pick an argument that defeats yours and dismiss it as meme talk. :)

Oh no, the fees might be lower!! We can't have that!! 
If you're truly concerned with "too much", let me put you at ease. The scaling debate has spanned nearly 3 years now with no actual progress (I'm aware segwit has activated) so we have plenty of leeway on hardware advancements.
Monthly Storage, bandwidth, or whatever next goal post are all cheaper than the cost of a couple transactions.

Bitcoin cash has the emergency difficulty adjustment. Bitcoin legacy does not. If hash power were to divert to the other chain..... The market value better increase **substantially** otherwise there is no incentive to return to the legacy chain.

There are code forks (nothing new to the world) 
And there are CHAIN forks ( comes with block chain territory).
A code fork is where someone can "copy" an open source project's code base. 
A CHAIN fork is a code fork of a crypto that results in a copy of the code AND it's data (block chain history) , usually with some different rules or parameters on the newly created fork. 
You can ignore a fork entirely of you want, as it doesn't affect you in any way if you do nothing.
The newly duplicated chain results in an exact copy of everything up til the point they split. Anyone who had X amount of tokens now has X and Y tokens of the same amount. 
When we get into hardforks vs soft forks... That's a bit too complicated for just 1 reddit comment.

Interesting article. I am working on such a "forum", but I had no plans of charging people to be able to post. The idea of paid moderators is something I hadn't thought of but definitely something I will explore once I have a user base.

I like the idea of a thread "score" preview and will incorporate something similar, so thanks for that.

Look at what's happening to xapo, they announce their fair policy regarding the fork and this sub has their pitchforks out.

People are aware of how this community behaves.
@_date: 2016-10-23 00:51:26
so any "wallet" is basically  like a email client (think  hotmail, gmail, outlook, thunderbird, etc. etc.). They are all communicating with the same protocol, and basically managing your public/private key(s). 
there isn't so much a web/desktop distinction, it's just every wallet is/can be different just like every e-mail client can/is different.
There are definitely web-based wallets that don't require any identification, and there are definitely apps that make you sign up with your email and shit. 
There are hardware wallets (like a tiny smartphone that only runs 1 app which is a wallet), paper wallets (a piece of paper with just the private key, hidden from the internet), and multi signature wallets (think 2-factor authentication).
you should research each of them, but if you don't want to think and just want a good balance of simplicity/security, I recommend [CoPay]( for the following reasons.
* Hardware wallets cost money and are still a bit complicated for the beginner
* Paper wallets require a lot of steps and also still pretty complicated for a beginner
* CoPay is open source, and available on pretty much every major platform.
* easiest implementation of multi-sig (so far, at least). 
* In case you lose your device or want to move your wallet onto a different device, it's very easy to import your wallet around (the app is pretty much identical on the web, iOS, android, OSX, linux, etc. )
I suggest creating a 2-of-2 Shared wallet and playing around with it (only spend like $1 total transferring funds around) until you feel comfortable you know what you're doing. Basically you'd download the app on your phone, then your computer. If someone were to hack you, they'd need your physical phone, the password to your phone wallet, you physical computer, and the password to your computer wallet. Otherwise if someone hacked only your computer, and somehow managed to crack your password, they'd attempt to send the funds out and you'd get a notification on your smartphone that funds are about to be sent out. You could approve/reject it from your smartphone and the hacker wouldn't be able to steal anything.
Once you feel confident, I would make a 2-of-3 shared wallet (so smartphone, desktop, laptop for example). And require a spending password for each device, also delete the recovery phrase on the device afterwards. So even if you lost your smartphone, you could access your funds yourself with your desktop and your laptop. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:49:18
Accepts multiple cryptocurrencies already.
@_date: 2016-10-22 23:54:07
banking is essentially keeping a track of who sent what. Banks do this and keep that information private. We're trusting them as the 3rd party to keep an honest record of all transactions.
Bitcoin also has a transaction history (ledger), but anyone is free to read/write to it. It's an open internet protocol similar to Email (SMTP). so yes, it's public by design.
The anonymity aspect pretty much comes down to exchanges. If you exchange a currency for BTC, you'll have to go through a 3rd party site that will usually require at least a bank account or a debit card and a good amount of your information (this is because of KYC/AML laws from traditional banking). So if you purchase from lets say, Coinbase, they send you BTC to a wallet they generate for you and they can technically tie purchases from that wallet to you. 
If you were to exchange cash for BTC in person, the transaction is anonymous because you don't even have to give the seller your name, address, etc. 
So lets say you have some kinky fetishes you don't want people knowing about, and you have some bitcoin. Sure you could buy whatever you want with a credit card, but that requires you submitting your personal info, your card credentials, etc. etc. to a site that could be sketchy. That item would also appear in your credit card statement.
If you were to purchase it with BTC, you could order the item just knowing the wallet address the site provides. No need to give your billing information, and it wouldn't appear on your statement. Pretty much similar to paying for something in cash, no record of it exists for someone to sniff through. 
Also, I personally prefer paying for things online with Bitcoin because it's faster than inputting my credit card information.

There was never dev mailing list discussion or public discussion on the segwit proposal unlike every BIP before it.

Now the community is split; we're fighting each other so bstream can benefit!?

As opposed to UASF? 
You are still free to fork to a &lt;17% hash rate chain. 
But the economic majority have agreed to this proposal. 
Besides, I thought all the fights were about getting segwit activated... That's exactly what this does.
@_date: 2017-07-24 02:57:38
not really. After ETH changes to POS, you'd need an equivalent of (might not have the exact amount) $250,000 in ETH to have a vote. Doesn't sound like democracy to me.
and to suggest changing bitcoin's proof of work to POS would be no different than hard forking like BCC (Bitcoin Cash).
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:21:47
Yet in reality, the price is rising because people want more Bitcoin cash (whether it's to dump or not ) and right now the only way to get more is to buy more BTC. 
With kraken and bittrex announcing support, it's not a coincidence to see the price going up esp after it was limp dicking after the segwit hype died. 
I hope everyone here dumps their BCC. I'd love to acquire more because you guys fell for the FUD.
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:49:07
(Available supply ) x (market price) = market capital.
as of current prices
(16,472,925) * ( $415 )  = $6,836,263,875
 putting Bitcoin cash just above ripple ($6,609,301,077).
And below ETH ( $18 bil).
What other "scam" has reached the  spot on the crypto market before even being released?
This sub would have you believe nothing will happen, or that BCC is worthless. It's pretty simple once you decide for yourself. Is a Bitcoin that nobody users due to high fees worth more? Or will the cheaper, easier to use Bitcoin be the winner? 
Is it better to have One main dev team who mostly all work for one startup? Or should there be multiple teams and multiple node implementations operating under one protocol? 
It's great having choice.

the bandwidth argument is moot. It *sounds* bad til you realize the numbers aren't bad at all.
If you are watching a 4.5 Mbps 1080p HD movie for 10 minutes over a fast internet connection, that's about 340MB total.  
People regularly stream 1-17GB on movies today as it is. This isn't even including the hours spent on youtube or instagram or whatever else.
Also your 300gb figure is incorrect. It's closer to 6gb/day , which is 180 gb a month. Not crazy at all, especially considering how important the utility from that bandwidth is. To quote you it's 180gb used for " liberating people from oppressive governments."
Shiet, I know people download more PORN than 180gb a month.
When it comes to "ideas" on how bitcoin should move forward, there's crypto-capitalism and crypto-communism. I don't believe in nerfing progress for the sake of poor people running nodes. Why? Because poor people DON'T need to run nodes in order to USE bitcoin or get the utility of crypto. 
You want to talk (mining) centralization? Mining is the most de-centralized it's EVER been. Don't believe me? Check whatever mining pool website you want. I won't link one because someone will accuse my source of being biased.

The github repo may have had 400 contributors, but the actual number of active contributors is closer to 20~.
So it's clearly the one with a *single* company employing more than half of the entity known as core.
Not the distributed teams behind multiple implementations. (Bitcoin Cash).

@_date: 2017-07-17 20:32:57
Bitcoin (as it currently is in 2017 ) , has a proven security model. And will continue to do so because all the incentives in place work.
When you introduce layer 2 solutions, not only is the security model changed, but miner incentives change as well. LN for example assumes blocks are NOT full, to open/close channels otherwise funds may be compromised. Ryan Charles has the world's only lightning network implementation in production, and he stresses the importance of on chain scaling (increasing the block size limit). 
Look at Dr. Peter Rizun's talk for more on security implications.

I'm also not going to dump either coin. I'll watch and decide accordingly like any rational person.
Unless you're going to offer me a better ratio than the current futures trading, I'm not interested.
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:51:37
centralization will occur because not as many people can run nodes due to the increased storage cost. At least, that's been the narrative so far.
Why do you think there is a difference b/t segwit 2mb and a blocksize limit raise to 2mb  for your hard drive?

I went through and found your claim of 90% being tests  to be false. I found the opposite actually. less than 10% of those additions/diffs are tests. 
I even looked for files in the 'test' directory and there was only one large file here.
sure its one relatively big file of additions but that is still not even 10% of the total additions. The rest of the code which i went through as all functions, constants, etc. Surprised to find so few comments actually. 
I'm pretty sure you pulled that 90% figure out of your ass, or maybe repeating what you read w/o confirming, but that is definitely not the case.

Not blockstream, because it would prove hard forks are not dangerous and that bigger blocks can actually work.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:46:21
Or... People want Satoshi's vision and Bitcoin always had the hard fork feature to let the market decide. 
If everyone (on Reddit) will do nothing but dump their BCC, you should have nothing to fear. If developers truly want to develop on SwitCoin, you don't need to worry about BCC having any products/features.
So you'll be fine. After all, BCC is a shit scam coin ... Right? No possibility of a flippening.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:37:01
- sort comments by controversial to get a balanced opinion
- take the time to understand the technology so you don't need to rely on "authority" to tell to you what/how to think
- the toxic people usually have financial reason to shill their position
- helpful people will try to explain things for people to understand so they can decide for themselves
- people who have been in Bitcoin from the start should have more weight, but some people will try to lie about this to their advantage. 
- don't rely on this place alone for all your information.
- when people irrationally attack ideas/people you should be curious as to why they are so threatened by said person or idea. Dig deeper, Especially if they don't provide an argument but are just being toxic.

impossible without mountains of context behind it. 
* You'd need to have a solid understanding on money to understand why people give a shit about cryptocurrency.
* You'd need a solid understanding of cryptography to understand how bitcoin works and why it is secure
* You'd need to understand inflation just enough to know why it's harmful and unsustainable
* You'd need to understand the history of anyone in power and how their behavior changes when they come into power. There's potentially trillions of dollars at stake in the future, you'd be crazy to think no one is going to try to pull some shady shit in order to control that.
* You'd have to understand the tribal nature of humans. Most people aren't going to have the necessary required knowledge so they'll just pick a "side". In an echo chamber such as this one, you really only get to pick one side.
* You'd have to understand the history of the Bitcoin scaling debates. "Teams" began to form out of a position that didn't exist before. In 2009-2015~ Everyone used to be FOR scaling, except every possible argument in favor of scaling started to be attacked as "dangerous", "risky", "damages decentralization", "untested", "too quick", etc. etc.
* You'd have to understand how Bitcoin upgrades itself through soft/hard fork mechanisms , and what "consensus" means according to the code. The problem is this definition gets warped exactly the way scaling did.
* You'd need to have been involved with the community from the start to know who the toxic players are and who are the ones trying to improve the space. 
So an explanation would do you no good. Any person's summary would most likely skew the reality of the situation with their own bias. In this case, it'd be that of the hivemind (thank god bitcoin is wayyyyyyyy larger than just this subreddit).
However, If you give enough of a shit to see why people care, I do suggest you start with researching money. Start with the properties of what makes money good. Start with why we even use money instead of bartering. Then look into gold. Why was gold valuable over money? Why is gold STILL valuable?

- Jeff Garzik, lead maintainer of btc1 aka segwit2x.
Basically someone ran an asic on testnet and blocks were mines more than 50x faster than expected, resulting in an older version without the new rules to cause the chain to stop because the &lt;1mb block requirement was not met.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:24:41
You're wrong. There is no equation following a chain split. The market will decide the value of BCC exactly the same way BTC gets its value as well.. through bid/ask.
@_date: 2017-07-01 00:16:46
It's not you. A lot of users have been banned for having a opinion that doesn't flow with the mods. 
What's left is exactly why this subreddit has turned to shit. The resulting toxic community is what happens when you are too selective about who gets to say what.

sooooo...... you first say they can't work.
then you say they will work
but then you pull the 1Tb/month figure (which is obviously a cop out) to save face. 
Then suggest a 300kb block size. got it.
I wish both forks well, I'm pro bitcoin since 2009 and I DO think bitcoin can and will survive every attack including governments.
Thank god we actually have options today that are **voluntary** and not forced down our throats like segwit.

Amazing you've convinced yourself into believing that. 
The majority of the hash rate is for segwit2x.
The miners were just going to fool everyone into siphoning them money? That's your actual argument? 
A bait and switch would do more net harm to Bitcoin and their mining hardware investments than any amount of temporary pump/dump .
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:11:37
nah, makes more sense to change[ 80 files and add 5,000~ lines of code]( fundamentally changing the way blocks are stored.
As well as requiring all current bitcoin developers to have to re-learn the new structure to even gain any benefit out of it. Causing fragmentation of features in the ecosystem as some will support and some won't.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:07:50
Because segwit is still controversial and people have bought into the idea that segwit = make Bitcoin great again. 
So to be "against" SwitCoin is unacceptable. It's too late for rational discourse, so the market decided to preserve Bitcoin. You're free to choose which Bitcoin you want to use, and they don't like that.
However, consider this; 
If segwit is so great, how come not every Litecoin Transaction is a segwit transaction?

you're asking for a future prediction. And the honest response is nobody knows what the market will do. 
If you want some advice, I would say EXPECT prices to be super volatile for the rest of the year. There is also another hard fork scheduled for November, and I would bet my left nut there will be a LOT of drama and FUD leading up to it.
I'm not planning on selling any of my bitcoin or bitcoin cash. I may start dollar cost averaging  both from  here on, or maybe BCC only. We'll see how it plays out.
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:32:38
It's sad to see someone so proud of NOT exploring other options. 
You've bought into the fear mongering to the point you won't even claim your free coins? Not even to sell it for BTC? 
Whether you are for BTC or BCC, how can anyone be okay with the damage this subreddit is doing to new people in the space?
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:30:30
offers an OPTIONAL fork for people who never wanted segwit forced down their throat. As well as the cheaper fees people have been asking for.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:20:17
are you confident enough to make a public wager?
How about a simple bet, If I can provide a link to a transaction After the BCC fork that 
- exists
- is cheaper in transaction fees than legacy bitcoin
that's sufficient enough evidence that the fork worked, and big blocks = lower fees (ish).
I will let you choose the coin to wager in, and whatever amount you're comfortable betting.

of course having choice is always better. But this subreddit will try to spin the narrative. These are the [list of current companies]( that will support the Bitcoin Cash fork. 
Not bad, considering it doesn't even exist yet.
After August 1st, you'd simply download electrumcash and import your private key (12 word phrase) onto that and you will have the same number of coins you had on the BTC fork.

@_date: 2017-07-31 00:41:52
referring to reddit Hivemind. Thank god the bitcoin community is massively larger than just this subreddit.
But back to the unanswered question.
Do you think people should have the choice to choose which fork they want?
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:25:22
There are several potential forks. The one(s) with enough hash power to survive a difficulty adjustment will survive.
*  There is UASF aka Luke coin
*  There is currently legacy Bitcoin (1mb)
*  There is segwit 2x 
*  There is Bitcoin classic
*  There is Bitcoin unlimited
*  There is Bitcoin ABC
As of right now, segwit2x has the most hash power backing it and uasf has the least. 
People are panicking because they fear a split would destroy bitcoin. We won't know for sure how the market/ecosystem will act, however if we look at the history of ETH/ETC , both went up in the long run , and ETH became the bigger chain. 
There will be a lot of FUD about which Bitcoin chain remains/becomes Bitcoin but according to the white paper, it is the one with the longest chain . The ones with little hash power will not be able to continue creating blocks or will be much slower.
As for your coins? They'll be "duplicated" pending how many forks survive. Let's say I have 5 BTC right now. If there are 3 forks that survive , it means I now have 5 BTC on Bitcoin, 5 BTC on Bitcoin classic, and 5 BTC on Bitcoin XYZ. Once exchanges add support for the other forks, it means I can start to buy/sell more BTC for whichever fork I want.
Hard forks are good in the sense that they allow the market to choose. Anyone can vote granted you are contributing hash power to the network.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:02:42
The market will decide.
Does that scare you?

You know how you want secure passwords and they are hard to memorize? A password manager stores and encrypts that data in one spot, making it convenient to have strong security without having to memorize a bunch of passwords.

I know that there are a lot of people (like myself) who didn't vote solely because we don't trust Luke-jr. 
It's a very selective polling. If anything, it only proves people who don't have an issue with luke also don't want a hard fork.
Which you didn't really need a coinbase poll for to begin with.

Paper wallets and hardware wallets get regurgitated here like they're the safest/only option. Multi signature is a thing, and most people can set it up without having to buy any additional hardware and without the hassle of doing all that offline booting into linux shit.
Basically, someone would have to compromise all your devices to steal your funds. The more signatures you add, the less likely a hacker has access to all of them simultaneously.
I wrote a tutorial on how to create a 2-of-3 or 2-of-2 wallet that would have protected anyone from this scenario, and I've gotten many non-tech savvy friends who were able to complete it and they feel much more confident about not losing their funds.

Who should decide the definition of what "core principles" are, and what "experienced developers" means?

I use Arch, but I also don't expect normies to know how or want to boot into a linux partition just to setup a bitcoin wallet. 
Also as long as you don't solely use windows PCs to setup your multisig, you'll be fine because the attacker would still need each signature.

me personally, I want a service like this where i CAN bet on myself. It should probably be team based matchmaking only though. 
I want to be able to money match people easily. It has to be easier than setting up an In-house game and having everyone deal with some site on top of that. I doubt there will be people throwing matches if there is ego on the line. Do you remember super smash bros. money matches? They were sometimes streamed/recorded and there's no way either person was going to throw the game even though it was sometimes only $5. 
You will need steam APIs for it to take off, take a look at dota2lounge.com to see what I mean.

A "Pay what you want" store for digital content.
Are you an author who wrote a book and just wants people to read your book without dealing with publishers?
Are you an artist who would like his/her music out there with the option of people paying you directly?
The idea is that the creators of whatever content would receive 85% of the transaction, and the site takes 15%. The price would be set to whatever the customer wants to pay. The content would be digital so that multiple copies can be made and sold. 
I'm not sure the legalities behind licensing and etc, so ideally it would be original material, nothing published or licensed already. 
Basically, removing the middle man publisher/studio and allowing creative people with a platform to create content and make money.

Also, what is your argument for why these so called "competent" developers can ONLY contribute to one repo? I don't buy it. 
The only reason a different implementation should make people scared is if they're worried said implementation is better. But you guys will have segwit, right? ����
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:06:46
there's 6+ different LN implementations.
At least 1 will utilize Segwit and Liquid and take advantage of the witness discount. Meaning artificially cheaper tx's for segwit/liquid transactions.
Guess which implementation out of all of them will be merged into core?
Of course this is assuming blockstream is still in charge of the main client in a year or so.
