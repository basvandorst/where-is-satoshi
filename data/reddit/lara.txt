I won't really use this but oh my god, do you guys love Kim Dotcom as much as I do? He's such a superhero! And I'm not even kidding! His life story is awesome.

What do you mean what I have done? lol

Bilzerian mentioned a few years ago that he bought into bitcoin, so he was already invested. We may find out in time to come that he actually bluffed the public, posted those snaps and then proceeded to sell into fiat causing the crash as others followed suit.

Some miners actually want lower fees so that bitcoin price will go up. In fact most would totally give up fees for a quadruple in price. That is why they want bigger blocks for non-seg transactions.

It´s gonna go up again

Well they created Tor, can unlock iPhone, control literally everyone on the internet.. I wouldn't be surprised.
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:42:13
Haha, downvoted just because somebody can't look up info on the internet. I thought it was a known fact that Tor had been funded by the US gov but apparently nah.

I believe it differs bank from bank, country from country. Anyway the amount of transactions is huge so I believe it's automated. Bank employees are notified of some weird transactions, they use special algorythms (software) to detect odd activity. Then they take care of these cases.

This graph is the dumbest thing I think bitcoiners use when the price moves.
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:20:12

The pic is a great allegory

I can see happening the same to Ethereum

So this guy is a CEO? I though CEOs were supposed to be atleast a little bit intelligent, why post such a trash tweet then?
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:23:19
Gonna read this! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-24 02:00:55
Aww, poor bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:30:30
Nobody expected a drop at all..
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:26:42
Poor guy, harshly used as a meme on a bitcoin subreddit
