That's exactly what happened. The banks were bailed out with printed money. Again, another irrefutable fact.
Your thought process appears to have been muddled by smoking chemtrails off your tinfoil hat.
**How did my facts cause you to conclude that recessions are impossible?**

Are you that ashamed of your fantasy?

How is the strongest currency in the world burning?

How? The USA is not allowed to print money in your fantasy? 
How does the USA printing money invalidate any of my facts? Which fact is invalidated by money printing?
Every other country on the planet increased their money supply as well during the great recession. What does this have to do with the price of tea in china?
Or do you wish to keep all the details of your fantasy a secret?

The petrodollar myth is a conspiracy theory to distract edgy baristas from their meaningless existence.
The following facts are irrefutable, and so far, nobody has even attempted to refute any of them.
the USA wants Iran to sell oil for dollars so bad that **the USA made it illegal for Iran to sell oil for dollars.**
The USA needs Venezuela to sell oil for dollars so bad that **the USA made it illegal for Venezuela to sell oil for dollars.**
The USA actually voted to allow Hussein to sell Iraq's oil for Euros - 
How has the dollar performed without these sales? -
It's up 10% over the past year! 
how, you ask?
Because oil transactions make up less than 1% of global dollar trade. **Over 99% of global dollar trade is not oil**
Total global oil trade is only about **$1.7 Trillion each year** 
But total dollar demand is over **$4.6 trillion EVERY.SINGLE.DAY!** 
Do you remember that time the dollar collapsed in value because oil prices dropped by 75%?
Yea, me neither.
These facts have cause many heads to explode, so we all understand if you are incapable of responding. I hope you are ok.

**How did my facts cause you to conclude that recessions are impossible?**
You keep hiding from this question for some reason. Is it fear that makes you flee from this question?


There was a recession. Denying that is another example of you denying reality.
We both agree there was recession. And printing money has nothing to do with your conspiracy. It's just another example of you refusing to address my irrefutable facts.
It's almost as if you don't contest a single one of my facts. 
Pretending my facts mean otherwise is the best you can do. 
Thanks for playing kid.

What does the great global recession have to do with your insane conspiracy? Is that a secret? It is a secret, isn't it?
It's almost as if you are incapable of refuting a single thing I said, and hoped to distract everybody by yelling "Squirrel!"

I said recessions are impossible? No I did not say that. And none of the irrefutable data I provided even mentioned recessions.
**How did my facts cause you to conclude that recessions are impossible?** I bet you want to keep that a secret, don't you?
Recessions have been occurring since before the first barrel of oil was refined. 
You are grasping at straws to construct a straw man to argue against. But sadly, there is no straw in your bankrupt conspiracy world.
I ask again, and I challenge you to answer, but I bet you refuse.

That horse has already been slaughtered and eaten by the Venezuelan people.

All money is fiat. 


You intentionally reversed what I said. The US said they could NOT exchange oil for dollars.


Yep, we are up to 3 countries out of 208.


Yea, if only the dollar could stop outperforming all major currencies, then maybe your wish would come true. 
Until then, you just have to deal with reality. I'm not saying can't dream,but Just remember that dreams are not reality.

Yea, every other country has sovereign title as well. The government is the ultimate title holder.

You mean China, the country with trillions worth of private factories owned by every fortune 500 company on the planet?
You mean China, the country with the 2nd most billionaires on the planet? 
You mean China, the country with higher inequality than the USA? 
Is that real socialism^TM ?
Private factories, billionaires, and inequality?
