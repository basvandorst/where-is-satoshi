@_date: 2016-12-24 13:13:43
It is because 4 years ago the halving happened in june and 6 months later the price spiked, now here we are again 4 years later, 6 months after the latest bitcoin halving and it is spiking again, last time it went 13x i'm hoping for half that so i would be happy with a 6-7x gain lol.

People are mining bitcoin on GPU's according to this thread!?!?!?
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:53:44
Running up against moores law is actually great for bitcoin mining decentralization, most bitcoin asic production is centralized around china and asia for obvious reasons "chip production and manufacturing" and cheap power. Because we are now on the bleeding edge of tech 7nm we will have to wait longer for smaller jumps in processing power and performance and this generational advancement will occur less often and be more spread out amongst more manufactures making their effects on the market more stable and frequent.
So instead of having a computer come out every 6 months that is 50-100x faster every 6 months we will get a computer that is 6% faster.  And instead of having miners that are useless in under a year we will have miners that are relevant for 3 - 5 years, the kind of equipment you might want to install in something like a furnace or heater.
These advancements also make it much less costly to ship the miners around the world, when you plug in a bitcoin ASIC that is 50 times more efficient than your competitor your profit goes threw the roof. The amount of money that is lost due to items being shipped can some times be huge 100s or 1000s of dollars per day. This has caused manufactures to either use them or sell the miners locally to people with cheap power.  Since advancements like this will be much more rare it will mean more company's will start researching and producing and sending their miners farther off to different corners of the world for less money. All of this is great for bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-12-19 15:13:10
This may sound weird but the most profitable time to mine is often times the least profitable time to mine because every one is competing for the same coins an equilibrium is established that is usually not very profitable. However when tons of people jump off of a coin because it is "unprofitable" i get much more coins for my effort and power consumption, then when the price rises i have made a decent profit.
@_date: 2019-12-19 15:41:20
What this guy said!
@_date: 2019-12-19 15:46:36
Probably not nearly as much as is used to power banks and world wide financial institutions.
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:02:27
Their is plenty of room for advancement its just not exponential leaps any more because we have caught up to current gen tech / moores law.
@_date: 2019-12-19 15:36:16
You must be unaware, bitcoin miners have run up against moore's law so their will be no more gigantic leaps in mining technology every few months, this means that the newer miners will be relevant for many more years to come. For example the most recent s9 from bitmain were 16nm and lasted for over 3 years some people are undoubtedly still running them and profitable today. This new generation will be in the 7-14 nm range which is the same tech as current CPU's and GPU's.

Another great quote, i love what he has to say but i must say i disagree some what on investing in bit coin, i believe as long as you invest in bit coin for the long haul you will win! And i am pretty sure that every one here believes that same thing or they wouldn't be here. I am pretty sure it all comes down to risk and how much of it people are willing to take, i believe the rule is never bet more than you can afford to loose and i am trying to stick to that...

It really was a great reply i couldn't agree more with him and of course i don't think i need to say that this wasn't the investment advice i was talking about... Investing in your self is probably the best investment anyone can make, i was talking about him telling people not to invest because its to risky... I first found out about BTC when it was at $30ish per crashing to $3 per and making an investment at that point would have changed my life...
@_date: 2016-02-04 11:04:12

@_date: 2016-02-10 08:05:12
This is what you call a direct quote its what happens when some one is observed making a statement, Ron Paul "of all the candidates running, socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was the most free market.
On occasion, Bernie comes up with libertarian views when he talks about taking away the cronyism on Wall Street, so in essence he’s right, and occasionally he voted against war,” the former Texas congressman said."

I can not for the life of me understand why people think buying gold/silver stock is a good idea, if Patrick Brine is right and i'm pretty sure he is, every fucking commodity on the stock market is probably leveraged beyond belief. So what will it be worth when it all comes crashing down, its just a piece of paper that has been sold 10x over to different people? Isn't the whole reason we are betting against the system because we all know its fucked and cant hold water?

@_date: 2016-02-03 17:46:19
I enjoyed this whole thing very much as i always do with andreas's talks i loved the joke he told about investing in bitcoin lol. "How do you make a million dollars in bit coin? Start with 2 million and day trade lol! But i must say i disagree with him on investing in BTC, as a young person in this time and age with no retirement fund, no 401k and no real opportunity's for the future, buying $60 a month in BTC, a real "asset" seems like a fair enough deal to me, i know its risky but its the only real investment opportunity i have, i would never invest in the house of cards known as the stock market...

You make some very good points, but i do actually know a guy who taught him self to be a coin dev and has made money working for btc over on bitcoin talk, i don't think hes actually paying the bills with it though, but i think tha'ts why andreas is trying to tell people to take as little risk as possible if they don't have the money to loose.
@_date: 2016-09-08 17:01:06
If the person you are dealing with does not know that you know about crypto or your brothers crypto i would not tip your hand, i would accept the lap top back with out question and run a file recovery program on the computer to find the deleted wallet files. If the person does not expect you to know about crypto they might even leave the wallet on the computer enabling you to easily access the wallet and transfer the balance over to a new secure wallet...

Guys we seriously need to slow down with the whole down voting because some one uses the same term as the donald. While this shit is not as fake as fox its definitely fake as fuck i mean think about it here, how long did it take them to start talking about bitcoin? Do they cover the real state of the economy? Do they cover the federal reserve?
