Transfer BTC to GDAX. Transfer BTC from GDAX to breadwallet, no fees.

@_date: 2017-11-12 08:08:35
Already below 2k!
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:15:32
It's all good now!
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:25:29
Wild right now!
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:41:24
I don't think so.. Yeah in the next few days you might regret sorry man :(

It is right now, so all the miners are mining BCH, it changes tomorrow and they will go back to BTC

From Coinbase? Take a look at this 
"Outgoing Bitcoin transactions are currently not being sent successfully"
I had the same problem, basically Coinbase didn't even send anything to my wallet yet. You might have the same issue!
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:04:48
Same here. It just doesn't send...
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:46:25
Safe to buy more or wait for a bigger dip? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:05:30
Exactly. I wanted to get them out of Coinbase onto my wallet before that.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:13:25
it really is. BCH keeps going down too
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:56:42
Was going to post that as I just took advantage of the deal! :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:20:02
I paid 49€ with shipping if I remember correctly!
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:15:25
Finally worked for me as well! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:06:15
BCH under $2000
BTC over $6200
We'll be okay guys :)
