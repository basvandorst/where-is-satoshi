Type in google Bitstarz scam and u will see hundreds of peoples stories claiming the same thing
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:41:47
They stole over 4 bitcoins from me then shut down my account and made up reasons not to pay me.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:47:32
There's the screen shot
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:24:04
And all I did was put a user name for the name but all that is required to deposit or withdraw playing with bitcoin is usually just an email right?
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:13:01
I mean really of course bitstarz is going to come out with a phony official statement saying that cuz there a total scam. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:56:59
So what bullshit am I saying u still haven't said
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:31:44
Give me a break I submitted my id and proof of my address. To you and all that information in the profile  isn't required by your company you can leave it blank when you play with bitcoin. All you need to have is a email address. Because that was supposed to be anonomys with bitcoin. And when you guys asked me for docs I provided my real docs. That's a pretty cheesy excuse to consficate my winnings after I have been playing for 8 months there. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:50:43
So they don't want to pay me because I put my user name as my name in the profile (which is optional)
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:18:27
Oh so know you do know Pavel didn't you say you didn't even know who he was in a previous post. Hmmmmm.. and that was just the start of the conversation and that's not the only person who was spoken to buddy. And certainly not the last. I love how edit with your photoshop though good skills to bud. You should be ashamed of your self for all your lies and bullshit you place everywhere to justify your company's illegal actives of stealing money from USA and U.K. Players and laundering it through all the banks and payment processors u guys use
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:48:55
So save it here are the whole transcripts notice at 531 it will take 12 hour s to review docs  Then less than 2 mins later he confiscated fund after what I said
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:38:18
I play at many sites everyday and have never gotten this treatment you vegascasino.io fortunejack.com 4grinz.com mbit.com you name it all of those sites are bitcoin casinos that won't steal there players winnings like you guys did. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:35:55
I have been invited by them every week to play I have been depositing there for 8 months then I won tried to cash out and they disabled and confiscated alll winnings. Really unfair they say I had multiple accounts huh what multiple accounts. If they looked into my account they would see I have rarely if ever used a deposit bonus and wasent using any bonus when I won they let me deposit over and over just to deny my cashout I posted the win just to show if u win big they won't pay u. And for people to please spread the word and repost this then they might look into it with enough support
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:58:47
They say I broke the rules specifically rule 4.1.4 in your terms
Now my friend emailed the transcripts from there employe James speaking to another player about being from the USA and playing with bitcoin on your site. James (from bitstarz) instructs the player to break the exact same rule by not entering all correct info into the profile and that they will not need to submit docs if they win.
Now I have been smart enough now to take screenshots of your terms of service because you have changed them at least 3 times since this dispute to fit your story.
Now just to show you how sneaky bitstarz is being they put on there site that if your from the "USA that you will not be able to play any real money wagering games including bitcoin" They now have changed this back since my posts.
They change and bend there own rules to whatever fits them best on a daily basis. To justify when they steal a members funds. Then after that they will change it right back to whatever it was.
Now just to make things clear your company will accept USA players using bitcoin but they will instruct you how to break there own terms of service to do so by breaking the exact rule you say I broke.
Now you your site justifies being able to accept players from the USA because they are using a virtual funds (bitcoin) which you say "is not a legal currency or tender and treated as virtual funds with no intrinsic value."
Now In the transcripts I posted here it shows you guys saying that bitcoin is no different than using fiat currency. And that is the reason you are saying you are asking for docs from me.
In the transcripts I have from James and the other player where he instructs the player to break rule 4.1.4 he states several times they will not ask for docs even if they win big and to not completly fill out the form and you can withdraw with bitcoin and email address that's it. That would clearly breach your terms rule 4.1.4
Now since I have posted on here they have changed thier terms of use on there site at least three times. So basically there changing the rules to whatever they need to at the time to justify taking your money by saying you are breaking a rule even though it may have never been there before you tried to withdraw.
This I found somewhat relevant and I 
quoted from Kelly jo posting at casinomeister forum on this issue
I also know that there are casinos that distort IP/browser fingerprint results to make false claims that a player has multiple accounts. Trackers gather external IP and Browser information. It is possible for users to share the same IP address on a network. (cable/dsl to a wireless router to allow for multiple devices) The website receives external IP/Browser fingerprint information. It does not necessarily receive private IP information that is assigned to each device by the router without permission. 
If all Bitstarz has is an IP/Browser fingerprint...? 
That does not suffice.
Did Bitstarz allow deposits to be made despite concerns of fraudulent activity (multiple accounts)?
It would seem that they did. This is not the first time Bitstarz has admittedly accepted deposits after suspecting a player of fraudulent activity, and although this was previously addressed in a similar forum, it is obviously a practice that Bitstarz hasn't officially addressed. 
Was OP allowed the option to deposit to multiple accounts? Did OP deposit to each account?
IF, in fact, multiple accounts exist...and IF these events transpired... then each account should be treated as a separate entity.
Bonus abuse should not apply if accepted within the parameters of each individual depositing
It matters that Bitstarz is held to the same standard with regard to their rights &amp; responsibilities as we players are.
It is my hope that Bitstarz will, at the very least, accept responsibility for accepting deposits in error and either pay OP the winning amount or
reimburse all deposits made and annul the relationship permanently.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:10:27
I love how you wrote that fake official statement trying to pass it off like softswiss wrote it. You fraud
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:15:07
Ok so now you call it an error. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:12:10
They changed there terms that had to deal with bitcoins and virtual currency's before they said it was not a fiat and bitcoin is a virtual currency that's how they would allow usa players but I posted the transcripts which showed him saying it's just like a fiat currency and they changed it fast.  and in FAQ section where it used to say that if you play with bitcoin and withdraw with bitcoin you don't have submit docs.   
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:54:21
Not to mention if you read in the comments on casinomeister you will see that you guys are in the wrong and that they are not pursing the claim because I kept posting to my defense otherwise I would have won. It even says that in the commments. So please bitstarz just do the right thing here.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:24:35
So now if you are a usa player watch out because they will not pay if you win big but they will take your deposits all day long.  
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:27:38
 I rarely ever even use any deposit bonus. And really what would the point of having 3 accounts be. You guys invite me every week to come play your site. so I do and I deposit like 400 dollars and win and then you don't pay me. I had no bonus going when I won. Why invite a player every week to play for eight months if there are three accounts. That would mean for the past eight months that you have been inviting me to play I could have only deposited and never win or withdraw. That is not really fair is it
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:11:09
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:20:01
But the truth will come out and I would like anyone else with similar experiences with bitstarz to please post there experience here too
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:39:21
Oops I better put the last comment on the other threads
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:56:22
I would recomend vegascasino.io they won't rip you off like bitstarz does 
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:03:15
 that's the whole transcript 
I put my user name in the name of the profile which is optional to deposit and withdraw with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:31:52
Exactly and there technicality is bogus. They don't even require you put a name when u sign up or withdraw. Just warn everyone else is all I can do
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:27:24
Yeah but  what for if u win big u r screwed go to another online casino that doesent rip players off
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:27:22
Softswiss is currently reviewing and investigating bitstarz to see if they should pull there platform and games from bitstarz casinos website.   Because they learned about bitstarz illegal activity allowing and stealing players winnings and deposits from people in the united states and uk. I guess there are transcripts of communications from bitstarz employees instructing usa players how to play on there site then confiscating winnings . Basically there stealing from people in the usa and uk and laundering the stolen money. A few other companies affiliated with bitstarz may have been aware of this. Hope not for there sake!
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:36:29
I didn't submit false details when u sign up with your site u require  a nickname and email address and that is all normally required to withdraw from your site correct. I submitted my real docs to you. And as far you saying your bank comments who got robbed it was me. You let me deposit there for 8 months robbing me I won you robbed me. I was not using any bonus when I won and you robbed me. I put my user name as the name in the profile and told you that before I submitted  docs. Not to mention you don't even require a name to withdraw on your site when you play with bitcoins. Which I'm sure you will change that soon.   This all you need normally to play and withdraw from your site which I provided 
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:55:55
Bitstarz sure has no problem taking your money when you deposit. And if you do win they still take your money and don't pay u anything so I had no chance to ever win there. They just kept taking my money for 8 months then refuse to pay me when I win. This makes me realize the risk of betting with bitcoin online at casinos so make sure that you are playing at a legit site before you play because scam sites like bitstarz will just steal your money and refuse to pay u if u win. And with bitcoin you can not reverse charges so be careful. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:24:23
Thank you and yes that's what I planned to do I just opened a new Facebook account for this and within 5 mins I got an enormous response. I guess I'm not the only person that has had this problem with bitstarz
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:25:11
Pavel Kaplunou. From softswiss . 
You know who he is you stupid liars at bitstarz. Again just spreading fake ass bs for your scam casino
@_date: 2017-08-31 03:22:10
No i dont know about those games but fortunejack has dice and i like playing on vegascasino.io
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:59:30
I can post the transcripts of James (from bitstarz) instructing a player from the USA how to deposit and play on your site as well.   
 when that is against your terms. Is that correct? 
It says that people in the USA and U.K. Are not allowed to play real money wagering games including bitcoin.  
But James (from bitstarz) instructs players to enter incorrect information in the profile to be able to cashout if your from the USA (clearly breaking the same rule you said I broke which was your excuse for stealing my 4 bitcoins.) 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:22:44
Oh and as for the details in the profile when you play on your site with bitcoin you are not even required to enter that information to deposit or withdraw because its bitcoin. I could have left it blank and it wouldn't have mattered. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:30:15
They emailed every week with free spins I did play those never cashed out on any. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:48:26
It said in your terms of service that with bitcoin you don't need documents to withdraw but you do reserve the right to ask if you feel something is wrong. But I noticed you did change terms of use after I won to fit your story. But when u sign up all reqiuired is a email and username and to withdraw bitcoin the same.
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:58:42
Oh ok thank you for telling me I'm kinda new here. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:20:49
Is that right!!  and what was it I lied about I provide proof of what happend I didn't lie . You must work for them to obvious. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:45:03
No rules were broken I deposited money won and u took it. Plain and simple
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:49:58
When you deposit with bitcoin all you need is a email to sign up and withdraw
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:25:31
I did not break terms of service what they say are lies I only had one account. Why would I need more? They to justify taking peoples money. This has happend to so many people it is a shame they can just steal from people and there is nothing you can do. And I am going to keep posting everyday so this won't happen again and either people will get the heads up or maybe bitstarz will stop scamming people
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:30:17
Rotten apples maybe you James mike chris and nick rom bitstarz are all scumbag thiefs
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:50:44
I did not take multiple bonus out just the free spins u offerd me every week to play. I didn't have a bonus going when I won and I hardly if ever have used deposit bonus. And as for other accounts what accounts are u talking about what email address and username are they
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:35:58
Oh did you want me to show you proof thats softswiss is investigating your thieving scam casino asses too
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:12:13
And what bullshit am I saying please explain.
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:49:48
Sure would u like me to post the conversations between 
Pavel Kaplunou (from softswiss) and a friend of mine or would you like me to email them to you.   Let me know
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:01:31
Had no bonus going they changed there terms of use after my win to justify it
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:18:44
And change there tos it's such a scam beware they are nothing but scammers
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:13:36
Then tell the truth and you won't have to repeat yourself anymore. You have been stealing my money for 8 months and won't pay out my winnings. And you make up fake technicalities to try and justify it. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:11:54
Well they stole 4 btc from me and my deposits and they couldn't pay my friend 300 millibit
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:31:12
And you didn't answer the question bitstarz do u want to see that proof!
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:26:59
No I did not have more than one account. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:19:31
 I rarely ever even use any deposit bonus. And really what would the point of having 3 accounts be. You guys invite me every week to come play your site. so I do and I deposit like 400 dollars and win and then you don't pay me. I had no bonus going when I won. Why invite a player every week to play for eight months if there are three accounts. That would mean for the past eight months that you have been inviting me to play I could have only deposited and never win or withdraw. That is not really fair is it
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:28:00
 There is the transcripts info for u
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:42:49
But it's technacilly a breach of there terms if they want to do that if u are in usa.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:42:01
Yeah they tell you to leave the country blank if your from the USA. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:37:59
And reference to the casinomeister the site that you pay through affiliates and other ways they just silence people with disputes so bitstarz can win because that's how the site stays open is funding from your casinos and others. Just like askgamblers that's probably owned by you what a joke you can't even submit a complaint there cuz they will suspend you if it's about bitstarz mike James and chris at bitstarz are nothing but dirty crooks that steal players winnings if they win. I deposited like 400 dollars that day didn't take a bonus won and got robbed
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:07:57
Yes I can post the communication between Pavel (from softswiss) and I on here. I also have the transcripts of James instructing players from the USA to violate your terms of use (specifacly the rule you say I broke) in order for them to play and cashout and he says they will not ask for docs. He says this three times. So he is telling people like me to violate your terms of use in order to play on your site but if you win you confiscate my money for breaking the rules your employees instruct you to break. 
That is a straight scam if you ask me 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:13:21
They told me they accept everyone from the U.K. And USA though but they said you have to access it through vpn. But who would want to do that when they are broke and can't even payout 300 millibit
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:17:15
No but even then if you cashout on a big win they will ask for documents which will show your are from USA then they will confiscate your winnings because it breaches there terms
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:40:49
Yeah I wish all these site would be legit and be fair to players
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:11:50
You notice they have no response to the fact that when you sign up all you need is a valid email. And with bitcoin as your deposit that is all you need to withdraw too. Unless you win big then they try to find some reason to steal your money or they will just make it up and change there terms to use that to justify it
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:41:35
Do you mean a site that actually works? yeah I usually play at VegasCasino.io that site is good they won't rip you off like bitstarz does I won 11 btc on the same game and they let me withdraw within two min. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:11:12
That is not me admitting to providing false details when you sign up you require a email address and nickname when u deposit with bitcoin is that correct? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:44:52
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:38:26
I have a ll question bitstarz why does it say in your terms of use that you don't take players from the USA. When I have the transcripts of James from bitstarz telling a player otherwise and about what to put in the profile. He is clearly telling someone from the USA how to play on the site. If you would like I can upload the transcripts let me know.
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:59:25

I play on other sites everyday and have never had a problem wit withdraws like vegascasino.io that's a good site to play if you are playing with bitcoin they won't deny you. They are a fair and reputable casino.

@_date: 2017-08-21 20:41:04
I sent you my id and proof of address as you requested didn't I. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:50:48
I believe that is just the start of it too
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:40:12
Yeah I spoke with James and mike at bitstarz there are the biggest rippers and then I posted my vmcase on casinomeister and askgamblers but it's obvious they just get paid by bitstarz becasuse they banned my post when I posted the screenshots that proved they stole it. The best site for bitcoin gambling is vegascasino.io by far in my opinion
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:28:49
And I rarely if ever used there deposit bonus I would just deposit and play. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:08:30
I did not ever admit to fraud. That is just a lie. I put my username in the name part of the profile and it's not imeven required to put a name when u sign up or withdraw in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:09:25
Not to mention I told you this before I sent my docs which were me.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:09:07
I won fair and square!!! Pay me my money !!!
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:24:55
The facts are this you say I broke the rules specifically rule 4.1.4 in your terms 
Now my friend emailed the transcripts from your employe James speaking to another player about being from the USA and playing with bitcoin on your site. James (from bitstarz) instructs the player to break the exact same rule by not entering all correct info into the profile and that they will not need to submit docs if they win. 
Now I have been smart enough now to take screenshots of your terms of service because you have changed them at least 3 times since this dispute to fit your story. 
Now just to show you how sneaky bitstarz is being they put on there site that if your from the "USA that you will not be able to play any real money wagering games including bitcoin" 
They now have changed this back since my posts. 
They change and bend there own rules to whatever fits them best on a daily basis. To justify when they steal a members funds. Then after that they will change it right back to whatever it was.
Now just to make things clear your company will accept USA players using bitcoin but they will instruct you how to break there own terms of service to do so by breaking the exact rule you say I broke. 
Now you your site justifies being able to accept players from the USA because they are using a virtual funds (bitcoin) which you say "is not a legal currency or tender and treated as virtual funds with no intrinsic value."  
Now In the transcripts I posted here it shows you guys saying that bitcoin is no different than using fiat currency. And that is the reason you are saying you are asking for docs from me. 
In the transcripts I have from James and the other player where he instructs the player to break rule 4.1.4 he states several times they will not ask for docs even if they win big and to not completly fill out the form and you can withdraw with bitcoin and email address that's it.  That would clearly breach your terms rule 4.1.4
Now since I have posted on here they have changed thier terms of use on there site at least three times. So basically there changing the rules to whatever they need to at the time to justify taking your money by saying you are breaking a rule even though it may have never been there before you tried to withdraw.

This I found somewhat relevant and I 
quoted from Kelly jo posting at casinomeister forum on this issue
I also know that there are casinos that distort IP/browser fingerprint results to make false claims that a player has multiple accounts. Trackers gather external IP and Browser information. It is possible for users to share the same IP address on a network. (cable/dsl to a wireless router to allow for multiple devices) The website receives external IP/Browser fingerprint information. It does not necessarily receive private IP information that is assigned to each device by the router without permission. 
If all Bitstarz has is an IP/Browser fingerprint...? 
That does not suffice.
Did Bitstarz allow deposits to be made despite concerns of fraudulent activity (multiple accounts)?
It would seem that they did. This is not the first time Bitstarz has admittedly accepted deposits after suspecting a player of fraudulent activity, and although this was previously addressed in a similar forum, it is obviously a practice that Bitstarz hasn't officially addressed. 
Was OP allowed the option to deposit to multiple accounts? Did OP deposit to each account?
IF, in fact, multiple accounts exist...and IF these events transpired... then each account should be treated as a separate entity.
Bonus abuse should not apply if accepted within the parameters of each individual depositing
It matters that Bitstarz is held to the same standard with regard to their rights &amp; responsibilities as we players are.
It is my hope that Bitstarz will, at the very least, accept responsibility for accepting deposits in error and either pay OP the winning amount or
reimburse all deposits made and annul the relationship permanently.
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:37:22
Yeah you think it's funny to steal a players winnings and 50 deposits throughout the 8 months I have been playing there right. (So funny) I'm glad you monitor Reddit so closely I can see why considering all the complaints on here of you stealing others peoples money too. So u gotta try to clean it up the best u can. But ultimatley you will get what you deserve you pieces of shit. You guys give bitcoin gambling with bitcoin a bad name. You give online casinos a bad name. People will just lose trust in playing with bitcoin because of you guys stealing which is a shame. 
Because there are some good ones like
 vegascasino.io.   fortunejack.com   and bitcoincasino.us that is where I will play from now on. 
Just stay away from bitstarz!!
Beware of bitstarz scam casino there crooks!!
You are pathetic and must be broke bitstarz .when you steal from your own customers. With all your fake adds you put out saying people won big at your site. Hahah what a joke!!! Yeah right I have seen at least 50 stories of you guys stealing peoples money. Your nothing but crooks low life curb creatures. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:19:10
I did not break any rules and you know it. I have been depositing with you guys for eight months now. I won and would think you would pay a player if they won. I did not use any bonus so u can't use that as an excuse and to withdraw from your site you require  a email address when you deposit with bitcoin right so really stop the excuses and pay me my winnings 
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:09:29
Would you love to see proof that softswiss is investigating your company for breaking your own terms. And laundering money you stole from players from the usa and uk? Huh bitstarz would you like to see that.
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:53:36
Again you don't even require a name to sign up just an email to withdraw too . Name is optional I put my first name and the rest of my username as the last in the profile . And told them I did this too. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:41:51
That's what you are doing you are stealing and nobody can stop you. You have been stealing from me for the past 8 months. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:33:01
All I did was use my username as my name and these three accounts what 3 accounts let's see the names on these and activity u say I opened which I did not. And notice in the transcripts how you say it will take 12 hours to review the docs and after what I say then 1 min later u confiscate the funds. And if I opened 3 accounts like you said why would you let keep coming on and let me deposit more without ever a chance for me to win and withdraw so can keep taking money but if I win u confiscate it that seems a little unfair and why would you let someone even open 3 accounts. You wouldn't because you lie and steal 
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:35:33
Cuz I only played 10 lines? what do you mean that's the most you can play. I won 4 btc on that spin and bitstarz won't pay me they rip big winners off and disable accounts.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:46:15
Hi I don't like to post anything but u stole 4 bitcoins from me. So I thought i would warn others like a lot of other victims from your site have before
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:51:50
It's ok if they don't won't to prusue my claim. I just kept posting to my defense on there site as rebuttal to what you were saying. So if you can't say pubicly in there forum the proof as to what had happend then that's there problem. If you guys don't want to be fair and honest then that's up to you I just want the money I won fair and square. It's up to you guys. If you want to conduct business in a dishonest fashion then people will not want to play at your casino.

Bitstarz stole over 4 bitcoins from me and disabled my account. They are scammers.
But the good news is softswiss is currently investigating bitstarz and might pull there games and platfporm from bitstarz for breaking there own rules by  instructing usa and uk players how to play and deposit on there site then steal there money. Basically they tell players from the usa and uk how to play on there site (which is against there terms) then they steal the players winnings and deposits and launder the money.
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:41:45
Would you like to see them?
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:36:14
You guys might have changed your terms of service around but anyone that has played at your site and withdrAwn knows that bitcoin was good because it was anonomuys so that is a weak technicality you are using when u never even required to fill any of that out before. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:34:20
Official my ass that's bitstarz statement from olle Dickson at bitstarz (another crook) he's the one that doctors up and edits all the bs photos they post. What a joke and you try to pass that off as an official statement from softswiss. You are such a fraud

They stole 4 bitcoins from me they make up lies and change there terms of use. 
letting gamblers know how BITSTARZ operates, in hopes that they too aren't cheated out of their winnings. As for the terms and conditions that i supposedly violated (4.1.4)...
Now my friend emailed the transcripts from a chat with James, he was chatting with another player about being from the USA and playing with bitcoin on your site. James (from bitstarz) instructs the player to break the exact same rule by not entering all correct info into the profile and that they will not need to submit docs if they win.
Now I have been smart enough now to take screenshots of your terms of service because you have changed them at least 3 times since this dispute to fit your story.

They say I had multiple accounts which is a lie.. I had been playing for 8 months and made like 50 deposits and rarely if ever used there deposit bonus. And had no bonus when I won. 
Bottom line:.. BITSTARZ should be held to the same standard with regard to their rights and responsibilities as we players are
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:23:23
I would rather do that then play at BITSTARZ SCAM CASINO

Bitstarz casino money laundering ring investigation 
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:49:38
Softswiss is investigating bitstarz casino scam operation and theft from USA players if they win big. According to there terms of use people from the USA are NOT allowed to play for real money Including bitcoins. 
But bitstarz has been instructing people from the USA to use a vpn and to enter there personal details incorrectly on there site in order to play. 
But if a player from the USA does win a good amount they steal all winnings and disable players account. Then they have been laundering the stolen money through there payment processor. A softswiss senior employee has told us his name is Pavel. 
Softswiss is in discussion to pull the plug on bitstarz to avoid legal troubles from the USA.

@_date: 2017-09-05 10:43:59
So stay away or they will rip you off if you win big. Since they did this to me I have read hundreds of posts all over the web of them stealing players money. Just type into google : bitstarz scam and then u can read some more stories of them stealing from other players.  There license is a joke all the ads you see of them say big winner blah blah is a lie. Nick, James  and mike from bitstarz are nothing but scam artists.
@_date: 2017-09-12 09:17:24
Invited this yeah right I play at many online casinos and have won large amounts like vegascasino.io I have won 12 bitcoins there and withdrawn in under three mins no problem. I thought bitstarz was a legit one but I should have looked into them further. Because all you have to do is type in google BITSTARZ CASINO SCAM and you will see hundreds of stories of them stealing there customers winnings and deposits isle they win big. But they will sure let you deposit over and over and even let u withdraw little bits but the second you win big they steal your money and disable your account and then make up fake excuses on why. So STAY AWAY FROM BITSTARZ CASINO THEY ARE A SCAM.  
I would recommend fortunejack and vegascasino.io personally. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:01:39
I would say more like swim in the toilet and complain about shit when it comes to bitstarz
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:53:37
They might remove all there games from bitstarz casino due to bitstarz casino stealing money from players from the USA. And then laundering it through their payment processors
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:51:28
I have transcripts , screenshots and emails as proof if anyone would like these you can let me know I will gladly provide it.
