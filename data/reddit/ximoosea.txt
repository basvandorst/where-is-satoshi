 great thought experiment!  You are precisely right, it all depends on what you are comparing it to.  If you hold Bitcoin stable then you could just as easily say the USD is very volatile. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:38:02
So not true.  BTC is holding up better than nearly all of the altcoins.

All futures are cash settled, you are not shorting bitcoin.  No bitcoins are bought or sold with the current futures contracts so that shoots a hole in your "for one" so now lets hear your "plenty of other ways for two".

This is half of the problem....so many people selling BTC to try and grab the coin-of-the-day.  Once the market weeds out all of the shitcoins and focuses on a select few, then we will see solid consistent gains.  The dot-com lesson all over....several survived and prospered (Google, FB, Amazon, etc.), but most vanished.  We have to repeat history unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:20:43
And how would they do that?  How can bitcoin be shorted?  It is not like the stock market.

Thanks  that clarifies it for me.  I did not realize that Segwit had already happened and that the Segwit2x that was called off was a different thing.  I am fairly new in following and need to look up a history of all of the forks, etc.  Based on this, it is surprising that Segwit wallets are not the standard by now.

Yes you can send out of Gemini into a Segwit address.  I do it often.  Also, Gemini does not charge a miner fee for transferring you Bitcoins out of the exchange.  I also like that Gemini allows $500 per day for ACH transfers whereas Coinbase starts at $250 per WEEK.

Yes, it seems like this has happened to several people.  We all needed to contact them and describe the problem.  They "reset" something and since then I have had no problems.  I have bought a dozen times since then with no other issues.  Others have reported the same.  Good luck!

The question was not if you care, and if you don't then you could have ignored this post.  But I do care, I want to understand and thus I asked for clarification from the community.  The question was if the current true Bitcoin has Segwit, the question was not if the new fork is a shitty alt fork or not.  Posts like yours contribute nothing and add to hostility.  
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:28:51
Yes. It is a spectacular book.

You are confusing nudes with miners, they are two separate things with different purposes. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:29:23
I have the same problem.  When I first set it up I transferred $100 and was able to buy BTC.  However, ever since that everytime I try to transfer I get "Transfer failed" with no explanation.  Has anyone figured this out?
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:19:25
Lol stupid autocorrect....nodes not nudes. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 04:51:22
I was a big supporter of Gemini over Coinbase but just last week my Gemini account was closed for no given reason.  Check out the Gemini forum, many people are having this problem.  I can no longer recommend them.

Actually decreases by half every 4 years.
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:24:42
Is there very much volume available?  For example, would you be able to buy 1 or 2 bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:29:09
Lots of good advice here.  Yes GDAX is the cheapest and quite good.  However you specifically asked about the Cash App.  I have used both and do think the Cash App is the easiest and allows you to buy more per day (unless you are willing to wire money to fund).  The "fees" work out to about 1.3% which is not horrible.

The Bitcoin Standard is an awesome book and hard to beat, however, I also really enjoyed Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money by Nathaniel Popper.  Great book and also very informative.

Thank you.   I did end up talking to someone from the company to better understand the issue with the CFTC.  I feel more confident now and will proceed.  Thanks for your reply.
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:57:12
No.  Bitcoin is still king here and it is not illegal to own. There just are not any exchanges to trade for fiat. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:57:53
This is incorrect.  Miners do not determine consensus.  Nodes do.  Please learn more about how bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:02:36
Please reread the white paper.  
@_date: 2019-04-11 06:48:38
Just fyi, the Cash App does allow you to transfer your coins out to your own wallet.  I have done it plenty of times and it is really easy.  It will not allow you to transfer coins into the Cash App and sell them for fiat.  If you buy coins on the Cash App and have never transferred them, then you can sell them for fiat, but not once you have transferred them.

Google metrics for China are irrelevant since Google is blocked in China. 
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:33:44
 thanks for pointing me in the right direction... it makes perfect sense now.  Cheers!
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:43:16
I caught that too....they have no idea what they are talking about.

I appreciate these posts but honestly how does the total BTC in circulation end up with a decimal of .044972?  Each block currently creates 12.5 BTC, before this it was 25 and 50 before that.  Thus, it is logical to me that the total bitcoins should be a whole bitcoin or half of a bitcoin....how do we come to xxx.044972?
