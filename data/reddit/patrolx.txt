You're seriously overthinking this.  The 'giveaway' is simply a plausible deniability play, hacker gives winnings to self, hiding among the noise of thousands of other people entering the amazing competition.  *loud knock on LuckyWinner's door* LuckyWinner: "hello officer, ahh yes the Bitcoins.. no I didn't steal them, I won them on reddit", Officer Plod: "alright son, don't forget to file it on your tax form".  Except it isn't that simple, there are many factors he's completely unaware of that will land him in jail.

My point is he potentially only has to win his own lottery once and figure the rest out later, or run multiple lotteries and use real winners as guinea pigs to see what happens.  I have no clue what his personal circumstances are but he'd obviously be crazy to use this strategy to exit more than once.

That phrase makes me cringe, did they "socialize profits" too?

Do not trust Bitfinex, do not be satisfied with what they tell you, take matters into your own hands and file your own claims and reports to law enforcement, do it now - time is your enemy.

Confession: I sometimes send a variety of coins through ShapeShift just for fun, it's a pretty cool tool.

Can you imagine your local bank announcing they were robbed recently and they're going to "socialize the loss" by emptying the accounts of everyone that banks at that branch? *cringeworthy*

He doesn't have to do anything.  A $500k-$600k exit is a nice chunk of change if he can get away with it, but it's a flawed strategy in many ways, and extremely high risk.  He could also give 1k BTC away multiple times to test the water with LE and wait and see what happens.  In the land of hacking creativity is king.

This is true, but he was fixated on a single issue.  The bulk of his emotional response was directed toward the claim about obtaining a private key from a single transaction on the block.  The fact he kept going back to this issue rather than focus on other questions being asked indicates 'avoidance' which suggests he's being untruthful, he repeatedly avoided other questions and aggressively went back to the fixation which he could plausibly defend as a truth (he felt safe there).  I'm certain he's being untruthful, and I believe his emotional response was largely tactical in nature.

Kraken must bow down to [FinCEN]( - failure to do so will result in catastrophic failure of their business.  This is not negotiable.

The fact that none of their customers will be out of pocket speaks volumes or do I have to mention other exchanges that didn't do so well?

Fair comment, that may have been a better title.  I'm definitely not a copywriter that's for certain and I appreciate your feedback.
@_date: 2016-04-14 22:47:21
Aren't you happy about the absence of bullshit and cover up?
This can't be said about the way many hacks are handled.
Aren't you happy  ShapeShift just proved it’s greatest strength?
It's easy to make claims, another to prove them.
Aren't you happy it’s certain that ShapeShift will be back?
Maybe it was a bad headline - but it's not the headline that matters its the content and I think the content is a positive thing for ShapeShift and  I hope it inspires the rest of the community to do better.
@_date: 2016-04-18 18:35:39
I really hope they're able to recover a good chunk of those direct losses.  Who knows what the actual losses are, it has to be much higher in downtime, investigation and engineering etc.

Now the exploit is well known it's probably just Craig Wright, pretending to be the original attacker.  He'll be patenting the method of attack shortly.

If a fork happens then the Ethereum Foundation absorbs all the risk and legal liability, they are opening a huge can of worms.  The terms/disclaimers of "The DAO" are worthless, they do not protect Ethereum Foundation, and if EF continue to act on behalf of "The DAO" and hard fork then there's no doubt in my mind legal action will be taken against them and law enforcement will become involved - it's very clear there's a conflict of interests here and there's clear evidence of collusion between representatives of "The DAO" and Ethereum Foundation, and possibly others including Poloniex.  Yes, I want people (disclosure: I am an investor in The DAO, and Ethereum) to get their money back, no I don't want to see EF / Ethereum (the bigger picture) harmed.

Expanding on this idea and thinking out loud I also want to be able to send my customers a Bitcoin gift.  I need a system that can set up a Bitcoin address, send some BTC to it and then distribute each account to my customers via email so all they have to do is install a wallet and enter their 12 keywords or something.

I would be very careful with Quadriga, they're not a registered MSB.  Take a look at [coinsquare.io]( they're based in Toronto and they're FinTRAC registered.
