    from netvend import netvend
    
    # balance_dict={}
    
    agent=netvend.Agent("correct horse battery staple", seed=True)
    query="SELECT accounts.address, accounts.balance FROM accounts"
    response=agent.query(query)

If you run that script often enough, you have a backup of all addresses and their balances. If netvend gets shut down and a new netvend server will be put up, you will just need to run that script again and compare it with the previously made backup to see if the new server has changed anything. If the new server has changed something majorly then don't use that one and encourage everyone else to not use it aswell.

Functionally speaking, a netvend server can be compared to a bitcoin network with only one node. If that node gets shut down, the whole system is down but anyone can put up a new node with minimal effort. Everyone just has to know the IP of the new node either by agreeing upon the new node before shutdown or through other means.

Thats 65kb. Ill see if I can figure chunking out myself :P
Thanks for the info tho.
I googled a bit and found out that yes indeed, since you are using "text", you have ~65kb size limit.
But there are actually many "variations"
          Type | Maximum length
    -----------+-------------------------------------
      TINYTEXT |           255 (2^8−1) bytes
          TEXT |        65,535 (2^16−1) bytes = 64 KiB
    MEDIUMTEXT |    16,777,215 (2^24−1) bytes = 16 MiB
      LONGTEXT | 4,294,967,295 (2^32−1) bytes =  4 GiB
It seems switching from TEXT to LONGTEXT would mean 2 bytes of extra storage per entry but would greatly increase the storage capacity. Considering people would eventually start sharing files bigger then 65kb, the need for extra posts will actually take way more then those 2 bytes. So it might actually be a way to save space. (Though sharing files bigger then 4GB will still require some form of splitting)
This is a proposal to change the field posts.data from TEXT to LONGTEXT to make sharing files easier and more space efficent.
@_date: 2014-05-29 11:05:06
I'm not sure if you are getting everything correct. Netvend doesn't use any encryption (though anyone can publish encrypted data), it only verifys signatures. Only thing netvend keeps track of is agents addresses and their balances. Everyone can see them.
That's the point of netvend, you can't delete anything. You can only take down a server of netvend but not individual entries. But since it is so easy to put up a new netvend server, it's virutally impossible to.

What I understand is that VARCHAR is used for storing the command in history.command (if history.signed is the same length as history.command, then that too) which means ultimate limit of ~65kb for a command and thus even smaller max post size. 
And that posts.data is TEXT which also has a ~65kb limit and thus limits the max post size.
So history.command, (history.signed?) and posts.data should be changed to LONGTEXT to allow posts up to ~4gb.

Yes, I get your point but you literally said "Everyone in the world", which to me means every living human being on planet Earth, babies included.

@_date: 2014-05-27 19:04:38
To continue on this topic, I also calculated how much it would cost to post until you would reach the max post_id (which is 4294967295)
Considering you only post 1 byte (not sure if possible to post 0 bytes). That would mean base fee of 3 msat + 0.1 msat for that one byte, totalling to 3.1 msat per post. 3.1 msat is 0.0031 satoshi. 0.0031 * 4294967295 = 13314398.6145 satoshi ~ 0.133 btc. At the current btc price, it is under 100$ to fill up all the post space.
But luckily there is bigint, which holds up to 18446744073709551615. (But it takes up 4 more bytes per post) For perspective that would require going through the whole current bitcoin supply (~13M) over 43 times.
The current biggest history_id is actually many times higher then the post_id so that would reach the max much earlier.
My point is that we should look at the max sizes of the current types used in the database structure and estimate if and when they should be  upgraded and make sure that the switch will not be rough when the time comes.
(Tell me if my calculations are incorrect)

This thread has nothing to do with the price so I'm not even gonna go into that.  
But alright. If you currently take the hashrate from blockchain.info, it is 242 628 592.63 GH/s. 33% off that is 162 561 157.0621 GH/s.
RemindMe! 24 Hours "Has the bitcoin hash rate dropped to 162 561 157.0621 GH/s ?"
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:01:56




Actually reading it again, you didnt exactly predict the hash rate to fall but rather that the price will fall to 200$ and that it may (tho it sounded like you deemed it very likely) cause the hash rate to fall. My bad.
The reason I replied to you, like I mentioned, is that you were bashing OP without posting a constructive reason, which you thankfully did.
The reason why the hash rate fell so much is quite likely due to randomness (like people have already mentioned).
I do want to say though that I dont think bitcoin mining can collapse permanently without bigger things causing it (e.g. global disaster destroying humankind or current technology, 0 people interested in owning btc, mathematical flaw in Bitcoin etc) which would probably destroy everything related to bitcoin anyways.
The reason is that the Bitcoin protocol is just a series of "guidelines" not something set in stone. As long as a reasonable amount of people agree with you, you can warp the protocol. Most altcoins are built on Bitcoin, they just call it differently and have some numbers/algorithms changed (difficulty adjustment, total coins etc).  
If the hash rate falls so slow that blocks would take ages to mine, the community could agree to start accepting blocks at a lower difficulty at that time (or just use a client with that coded into it) or change the protocol to avoid it happening again. Which are usually classified as hard forks.
Tl;dr Hard fork to manually adjust difficulty or change the difficulty calculation all together.
However I do agree that a temporary big dip or collapse of mining can be quite devastating.

I can provide quite a list of reasons why the mining won't collapse but not before you provide a reasonable reason why you think bitcoin mining will collapse. (unless the reason is the % loss in hash rate in 24h, in which case just wait and look)
@_date: 2015-01-19 10:03:45
This is not true. Bitcoin (protocol) is not limited to the internet. Currently internet is the fastest, cheapest and almost the only way bitcoin is used currently (no reason to use anything else in most cases) but it is entirely possible to use a wide variety of things to transfer transactionnl/mined blocks etc. For example: morse through wire/light, written letters, radio waves, phone calles, sms's, heck you could even yell or talk. Internet is just way better in most aspects.

Well here you go, remindmebot must be sleeping or something but 24 hours has passed.
According to that blockchain.info, the current hashrate is 336 619 849.24 GH/s. This means it has risen ~38.74%, your predicted percentage isnt far off, just in the wrong direction. Infact the hashrate is ~107.07% higher than what you said it would.
And the average time between blocks is 9.35 minutes. Not only far from your wild predictions but below the 10 minute mark.
Please do let me know if my math or logic is flawed.
If you are not comfortable with "bitcoin fundamentals", I see no reason to read or any other bitcoin/crypto stuff but I guess that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:08:21
If it is of any interest to you, I havent spent a single cent of fiat on bitcoin. In this context it doesn't matter too much but 36% off twice doesnt result in a 70% total decrease but rather a ~60% decrease.
If I understand correctly, you say that since the price is falling and will continue to fall, people will turn off their miners because the total return of value won't exceed the costs of mining? (And the consequences of that)
Thank you for providing a proper reason, most people I have talked to on similar subjects, don't.
I guess we should wait till the 24 hours pass and see if the hash rate has falled as much as you predicted. I have yet to check the hash rate today.

Well I was more discussing whether this behaviour being possible is good for the network or not. Since miners have an economic incentive to mine empty blocks, it's quite safe to assume they will.
Sorry, I didn't thoroughly read your conversation, I focused more on the longer term, but it will indeed be slightly skewed in the *transition* periods. I just got the impression that Yoghurt just included the transitions as a side point.
@_date: 2016-02-18 15:51:10
Yes, actually now that I think about it, it does indeed decrease the transactional capacity. My bad. The amount of work done for each transaction will stay the same but since the difficulty adjustments on average keep the amount of blocks constant over a period of time, if x% of blocks are empty, the transactional capacity will decrease by x%. Furthermore, since potential attackers can also use this tactic, if all miners mine empty blocks, it doesn't have an effect on attackers but if some miners don't mine empty blocks, the attackers actually have an advantage by artificially inflating their hash rate compared to others (by not waiting for a block to be populated). Neither does it really affect the miners profits since that is also constant over a period of time on average (due to difficulty adjustments), it only gives some miners an advantage over others who don't mine empty blocks, total income for miners is still the same. Since the transactional capacity is decreased, it instead decreases the block size and propagation times though.
So all in all, it reduces the transactional capacity (by % of blocks that are empty), has a neutral or easing effect on attacks, doesn't affect the miners income in total and slightly decreases block size and propagation time (due to the decreased transactional capacity). How many of the blocks are empty and how much it actually effects the network is another story though.
You just helped me prove all my points wrong, sorry and thank you :)
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:47:45
~~It doesn't really affect the network negatively besides the marginal blockchain size and bandwidth usage increase (empty block are smth like 0.1-0.2kb vs hundreds of kbs in usual blocks).~~
~~On the plus side, it increases the profit of miners, which in turn relates to higher network mining power and thus higher security.~~
This is not true, thanks to @_date: 2016-02-20 13:03:43
Thanks indeed ;)
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:11:50
Yoghurt is right, I explained this a bit [over here]( The difficulty adjustments, on average, keep the amount of blocks in 2 weeks the same (~2016), no matter the total mining power of the network, if 10% of those 2016 blocks are empty, the *max* amount of transactions in 2 weeks is plain and simple 10% less (it will increase the time necessary to get your transaction in a block either way tho). Attackers can only potentially gain from this behaviour as well.
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:41:07

I was referring to "Diamond", assuming this story is correct. But there are plenty of other examples.
The bar at which a government can be considered "functioning" is subjective though and while the US perhaps isn't the best example, there are definitely many properly functioning governments in the world.


It can sound right but unless you ask a big chunk of the US population on what they think about it, you shouldn't make the claim of 99.999%. I wasn't able to find a study on it in a bit of googling and I don't think you have much evidence to back it up either. Either of us could be right but 99.999% sounds unrealistic, perhaps it could be 99% but 99.999%, I don't think so.

You say to a person who gives a fuck.


Top FBI agents scoring millions a month from illegal activities and plotting to kidnap people to make even more millions is called a functioning government ?


Assuming is american, you would have to confirm that at least 99999 other people agree with you to even vaguely make that claim. In fact, according to you, only 3189 people in the US don't want to pay taxes. But even if you only look at the people who don't pay taxes (not just don't want to but still do), according to the IRS, in 2006 400 billion dollars was lost due to tax evasion. That would mean that the 3189 people avoided about 141 million dollars of tax, each. I believe you can figure out if that's realistic or not. Don't throw random numbers around without a source, words like "most", "majority", "overwhelming majority" etc exist for a reason.

The miners aren't looking for encryption keys. I would call it buying lottery tickets with electricity/computing power.
Or editing the block (the nonce) until the hash of the block is below a certain number (difficulty), thus each guess requires you to calculate a hash.

While mostly impractical (speed, possibly security etc), it's completely possible to encrypt any message with a bitcoin key (there are even multiple tools for that).

It's not impossible. There are just many downsides to it (speed, available tools, possibly security etc). However with just a bit of googling you can find multiple tools in many languages that allow just that, en/decrypting any message/data with secp256k-1. After all signing is essentially encrypting the hash of a message.

You could track it quite easily, providing you have enough processing power but the problem is when someone pays with 50/50 tainted/legit coins or 1/99 or w/e. Say all but one merchant decline 1/99. If the one merchant gets a sale for 1 tainted btc and 99 legit btc in the same transaction, effectively the whole 100 becomes tainted. Also someone could send small bits of tainted btc to random people. If those peoples wallet software sends tainted coins with legit coins, it would also taint those coins.
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:13:35
Thank you.
Although I haven't studied math at an university. I do believe that the function would have to include the whole blockchain in itself (or only unspent transactions or smth like that, which would also make the function 100% accurate). Otherwise you would leave parts of the blockchain out and people could and would abuse it by including invalid transactions which would defeat the purpose of the blockchain.
My point is, that while it is a good idea, I dont think you can create such a function (without including the blockchain, which would defeat the purpose of it).

I might be incorrect but I'm pretty sure that if your salt is perfectly random and isn't compromised in transit anywhere than it wouldn't matter if your device produces random data or not because even if your compromised hardware only outputted the same values every time, you would still have to brute force for all the 256 bits of entropy the salt added(adding the non-random 256 bits might actually make the checking slower) and if your hardware produced 16 different values you would actually make it 260 bits to crack, which would be harder than brute forcing your whole 256 bit private key.
However if your salt is compromised, especially if only a few people know it, your points are true since you need both the seed and the non-random value(s) generated by the hardware so the 2 parties would need to find each other and co-operate.
Note that the part where I'm not 100% sure in is that if hashing(in this case with sha256) 256 bits of entropy(salt) with a known value(from the compromised hardware) results in 256 bits of entropy or not. (My guess and the basis for the text above is yes)  
But even if it reduces the entropy of your key to 128 bits(random guess) it would still take trillions of years to brute force it with huge amounts of computing power.
TL;DR  
If your salt is perfectly secure, the security of your hardware shouldn't matter, otherwise using a salt would still add security. Generating a secure salt yourself could be considered destroying the purpose of this device however.

Are you calling the linux kernel an OS or is "THE" some linux distro?

Most encryption schemes can't necessarily encrypt all of the data in a single pass. The data is converted into *blocks* and then *chained* together, that's where CBC-Cipher Block Chaining comes from. And yet again, nothing stops you from using similar methods for asymmetric encryption using ECDSA.
Using [this]( tool, encrypting 398 bytes took about 2 seconds on my computer. The code could be heavily optimized but to a certain extent. Feel free to decrypt the following message and inspect the code if you don't believe me :)
