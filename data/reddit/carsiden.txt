The difficulty rise over the last year is because of ASICs. It is a leap in computational power that can be compared to when GPUs entered the mining hardware plethora. If you look at the logarithmic graph of the difficulty you'll see that the GPU revolution actually had a bigger impact on difficulty than ASICs. And you also see the leveliing off of the difficulty increase. so no anomaly

I'm thinking about the possibility to use a blockchain as a news distributor. A news stream is very much like a ledger. You can write news but it's very hard to erase it. In fact you usually have to correct it by adding a new piece that corrects the former erroneous piece, just like in accounting.

Corporate mining is probably selling 2000 BTC per day (out of aprox 3600 created daily) because they want to avoid currency fx risks. This means that aprox. $ 1million more needs to be invested in BTC every day for it to keep its value. 
I guess 2000 BTC because I read in May that KnCMiner alone was selling coins at a value indicating they mined aprox. 1000 coins per day at that time. They have competition and are expanding as are their competitors. But it's still a guess. 
Keep in mind the current inflation rate of BTC is 10% anually. A lot more than most currencies. (3600x365days/13.000.000 BTC in circulation)
