If I could buy PUTS in my brokerage account, I would be all over it.

0%  I would short it if I could figure out how.

that took 48 hours

OP you have balls of steel. 
If my math is correct:
$30,000.00 / 14 = ~2142 units times a price of 143 right now puts you  at $306,000.00
Consider the marginal utility of more money vs. the probability of your position continuing to grow. 
Another thing to consider is you are not $30,000 of debt into this exercise - You have $276,000 of your cash invested in bitcoins. Ask yourself if you woke up tomorrow and you had no bitcoins and you had $276,000 in cash would you buy bitcoins with ALL of your money. If they answer is YES, carry on - if the answer is no, take some or all of it off the table.
Good luck.

You are witnessing the up part of that scenario right now.

The USD has not fallen 3% in the last 60 minutes.

No. This is how bubbles work

Sell it and see the funds into your bank account before you resign.  This is a textbook bubble.

You seriously think your generation will fully adopt the bitcoin? 
I have been out of school for some time now. 
Here is a good place for you to start reading:

This is a textbook bubble. Standby for an epic crash

you might consider the next 30 minutes.

$18MM is a lot of money to have tied up in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:10:18
That DEescalated quickly

If I could buy puts in this, I would. People are buying these because they are going up, and they are going up because people are buying them. When you run out of buyers - There will be a panic and subsequent crash.
The concept of the bitcoin is great, but it will be ruined by speculators. If is does take off like everyone here believes it will - The government will step in and put an end to it.
