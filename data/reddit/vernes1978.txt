So I sit in this trafficjam and the guy in the car next to me opens his window. So I'm like 'what does he want?', so I open mine as well.  
Before I can ask he looks at me surprised and asks, 'Did you fart too?'.

As a coder, a realistic scenario that would horrify me would be:  
The system is set up, new wallets are created serverside for customers, and under rare conditions... the encryption fucks up and the wallet data becomes random data. By the time we noticed, millions have been lost forever.

Are you blind? When a judge tells you you can't know the witness or else you will murder him, is or isn't the judge making the statement you are a murderer?  
@_date: 2014-12-14 19:23:07
sigh  
  
The man has been accused of hiring a hitman.  
He is not found guilty of this.  
status quo is that he has the same rights as everybody else who is not a proven murderer.  
  
If you would now go to court, you would not get told you are unable to face the witness because you might murder the witness.  
UNTIL it has been proven he hired a hitman, this guy has a right to know who the witness is so he can defend himself against the claim **JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER PERSON**.

I do not know what the details are of the story MtGox is telling.

I always wonder why people first give kneejerk reactions first and elaborate explanations after their downvoted remark.

@_date: 2014-12-14 17:23:34
Then the trial is being held while the accused is not yet a proven murderer, and the claim he will murder the witness is unfounded.

But do you think when someone actually noticed their private key has been figured out, that person was the very first one?  
Or do you think he was just the first of MANY who noticed first?  
  
What I'm aiming at is that we [ALREADY]( have encryption techniques that offer roughly thesame level of complexity while using methods that do not lend themselves to faster solution using quantum computers.

I thought a wallet is a file.  
A file containing data generated with a complex math that makes it near impossible to replicate.  
You have that file, you have your wallet and the coins it contains.  
Find your old computer on which you mined the coins.  
  
I think that is step 1.  
I'm sure someone can confirm this and help you after step 1.

I was interested and wanted to create an gdax account.  
Upon clicking the create account button it told me I now have an account without me filling in ANY info.  
So gdax and coinbase use thesame authorization.

Why should I pick one or the other?

no, you hang on until it reaches that value again.  
next time, wait until it drops before buying.

if you sell now you have no Bitcoin, and a loss.
