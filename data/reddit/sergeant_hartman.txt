I am of the opinion that, considering the number of distinct passwords users must remember, as well as the length and complexity GPU clusters can break, human memory is simply inadequate. Long, randomly-generated passwords would work but would require being written down... and can still be keylogged.
In short, here's the we it breaks down in my analysis:
 * 8ch random = safe against online-only attacks
 * 12ch random = safe against online-only and offline brute-force attacks
 * 2-factor = safe against online-only, offline brute-force, and keylog attacks.
Not random? Then they can be guessed (for some subset of the user population).
Programmers hate it when I tell them this because they realize how much vulnerable code they've shipped in the past. The only way to set some of them straight is to hack their shit and show it to them.

The single factor you miss is that the defender has to be right 100% of the time and the attacker only has to be right once.
And no matter what complexity test you pick, some user will come up with some variant of Passw0rd! which the defender's password screen overlooks but the attacker's generator guesses. The heart of the password problem in the meat between the ears, not in the software.

It will stabilize at a level where mining is only possible to people with low electricity rates. If you pay more than $0.10 per kw/hr mining will be a loss for you even with free hardware.

For starters, being responsible and using HTTPS everywhere is a solution to many many security problems. For finishers, using HTTP does not solve any security problems. 
There is no more to add to this discussion. One is more secure than the other.
The argument you were trying to make (X does not prevent EVERY security problem, therefore X does not prevent ANY security problem) is a very stupid one.

Running the numbers, it looks like my $300 card will probably pay for itself before mining becomes unprofitable, but it won't make me much if any profit. Stupid exponential mining growth :-(

It's an arm's race I've never in my career seen anyone win. Perhaps you have an example to back up your claims? Or are you just speculating?
Given any arbitrary password restriction, an attacker can create a password guesser which will effectively generate the sorts of passwords humans are likely to select.

What do you mean by "work?" Of course it could work in some way. You could create a bank and have borrowers and depositors.
It would not "work" in the sense that the banks would eventually default. When banks loan faster than new money is not printed, they will eventually be unable to collect on their loans and unable to pay their depositors.
All money has this problem, but with central banking, central banks can print money to recapitalize banks during financial crisis. There is no such option with BTC, so BTC banks will eventually go under.

Can't really compare. NASDAQ companies overall were making money and paying shaeholders. Bitcoins are more like the penny stock of a bankrupt company.

The difference is that there is one and only one PIN for most people.  There are not hundreds. I have hundreds of passwords to remember. I could not remember unique random passwords for hundreds of accounts. PINs can also be short.
Look, this is my job. People pay attention when I talk or present about this subject or other security subjects IRL and I'm getting bored of some random internet guy asking dumb questions of me. Keep thinking critically. But I advise you to defer to experts when you're out of your field.
Multi-factor authentication is the only valid authentication for any body of users grater than one or two.

Wrong. You can see what they're willing to pay. Because if a better price were found on an open market, they would go for that one.

Yes, but when The Bank has a record of everything you do, it is a whole lot easier to audit your records.

Users have more passwords to remember than PINs. And actual random passwords (including numbers and punctuation) are harder to remember than PINs.
You forget that stealing laptop bags is local, not remote.
And you are confusing discussion of passwords generally with discussion of specific implementations.

When a currency fails, people flee to USD, or possibly EUR. 
Bitcoins might stay useful if they ever start being used as currency. I would personally love to see that happen. But ANYTHING that gets its value entirely from speculators NECESSARILY crashes to dust eventually.

In the stock market, something is considered a fair investment if the "payoff" (P/E) is 15 years.
But the major difference is this: the difficulty will keep going up. Instead of growing profits over time, like stocks, mining will have shrinking profits over time.
Looking at it in this regard, mining is more like buying bonds of a nearly bankrupt company, hoping and praying that they will pay off just a little extra before they become completely worthless. 
It's buying mining hardware is more like junk bond speculation than mining minerals.

Yes it is. Crime is the fault of the criminal. Theft is the fault of the thief exactly as rape is the fault of the rapist.

It's also conceivable that miners are selling off less now that the difficulty increased. Since there's no actual reason to believe one or the other (you have shown no cause or effect), it's absurd to make any statement to that effect.


Mining does not effect the supply of bitcoins. It also does not effect the demand for bitcoins. You have failed to tie cause to effect in any of your statements.

You're right. Mining prices (whether gold or BTC) do effect the commodity prices. By a small fraction of a percent. Over a very long time. These numbers are so small as to be negligible.
