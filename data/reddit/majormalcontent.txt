I think "run" is a little of an exaggeration. The support number given is for Toronto, but nobody answers it. Recently I had an inquiry I wasn't getting help with via email, so directly contacted a person here in Toronto who had helped me with something last year by phone. He made it very clear he wasn't working with them any more.
Furthermore, QuadrigaCX's web site sure makes it look like they are still based in Vancouver.

Gotta admit I don't really get either of your comments, but that's OK. And I believe that's "baghodler", is it not?

I'm smarter than you think, junior.

Gee, sorry Mr. Phucknhell; didn't realize "new users (12 posts)" were just supposed to STFU and not say anything and let the idiots who accumulated all their posts by making stupid assumptions about the motives of others rule the  roost. Why is it funny, smartass? Because you can't take the time or don't have the intelligence to understand a post that has more than 15 words in it? Too many syllables in all those words? Ideas too high-fallutin' for ya? I've got something intelligent to discuss; do you?

I'm wondering if the fact that BTC is prohibited in the good old USSR is going to be a problem for Mr. Ed.

That's what it sounds like to you, huh? Bzzzt...wrong. (Pretty juvenile interpretation of what I said initially, BTW; are you describing your history and assuming the same must therefore be true for everyone?) I couldn't care less whether people before me or after me have made money on something; it'll always be that way in life. I may have made an investment in BTC that loses money in the end, but that's not necessarily a bad investment in my books. Like I said, I'm invested for other reasons than to make a quick profit. And even if in the end all the fiat money that I've spent on this experiment vaporizes, I've still gotten my money's worth AFAIC. That may be a somewhat difficult concept for many redditors to get their heads around, but that's the way it is.

An alternative theory is that he could have been snooping around for intel to make sure his tracks were covered for his past malfeasance. Sounds like this went down only about 6 weeks before he was busted. It's very possible he was starting to figure out that the feds were on to him.

Clever :-) Wish I'd thought of that.

Bought high, huh?
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:09:08
Well first of all, note that my avg purchase price is in $CDN, and secondly I think you're missing my point. I'm fully prepared to "lose" all of the fiat money I've spent to date. I'm not in to make a quick buck. I'm in for my own education, because philosophically the ideas behind BTC resonate with me, and because I am fascinated to see how the societal experiment of the blockchain model plays out from an insider's perspective. I have skin in the game.
And one other minor point: 5000X&lt;&gt;5000%
@_date: 2015-04-04 18:40:38
Agreed, especially with your first sentence.

BTW, that's "I AM CANADIAN". What's this lazy-ass "I'm canadian"?!? (Is there a subreddit to send someone a face-slap)?

Toronto boy bought my first BTC in January from a guy on localbitcoins.com. Since then have bought a couple more from him and some on CEX.IO cuz they take Visa. I plan on using local buys from Mycelium as well when I next buy, FWIW.
