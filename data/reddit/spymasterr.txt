That's not true, rich people don't print money they just make a lot. 
So your solution is to liquidate you assets... this does not seem stable.

I understand the network effects of bitcoin I read the entire thing. It simply does not answer my original question at all.

There is no gold standard with a decentralized currency, bitcoin is the price that people decide it to be, if half the country decides is worthless, you my friend are fucked.

Yes, but we haven't reached a point where everyone is using bitcoin for everything. 
That is the day an altcoin will destroy bitcoin.

No but fuck you im poor now and so are 10 of my friends and you have a Ferrari. We all need to eat so fuck your Ferrari were making poorcoin and every store in my neighbourhood is going to use that until we can branch out and then suddenly all you rich assholes aren't laughing anymore your cleaning our toilets.
Do you see what I'm getting at..

Right, that's what I'm saying the problem is. If the poorest 50% of the country get a political leader saying that "altcoin" is the new coin to use, they will jump on board as to devalue bitcoin, and then force wealthy bitcoin owners to buy into the new coin as any coin will be usable similar to currency at any store. Bitcoin is just the one that's going to get merchants online, they will be able to use any coin on the market... it's not like there's going to be any regulation to force only bitcoin..
