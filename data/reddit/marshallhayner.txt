We ENCOURAGE users to keep their large cryptocurrency savings in cold storage ALWAYS. This is the best security practice. Bitcoin is your digital petty-cash wallet, and as such you keep a smaller amount in it. Paper wallets, stored in a safe place is the best way to go when it comes to security.

lol @ journalists. They transferred the bitcoin into his bank account did they? I'm sure the guy that got mugged could only wish that he transferred something into his real bank account so the police could nab him... In this context the author is clearly confused.

We don't have access to your private key, we are a heirarchical deterministic wallet service. The QuickCoin Social Wallet is meant to hold a small amount of Bitcoin. I always advise Bitcoiners to store their larger "savings" amount of Bitcoin on a cold wallet address (on paper).

I highly recommend cold-wallets for long term storage of your Bitcoin savings.    
    
    1) Download Electrum
    2) Take computer offline
    3) Generate a new wallet
    4) Paste the seed into Textedit/Notepad
    5) Paste the private keys into Textedit/Notepad
    6) Print several copies (keep in safe/private places)
    7) Delete any files in ~/.electrum/wallets/    
    
Now you've got a cold wallet :)

Nice to see you. I understand your sentiment. We want our users to keep what they would keep in their personal wallets in QuickCoin, that is to say a spending amount (petty cash). We are working on ways to combine security with ease of use as well as prevent our users from being phished. It's not an easy task.
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:48:15

@_date: 2014-07-25 21:24:09
Electrum all the way. In general, you should always control your private keys without giving anyone access. To those saying use Mycelium, I don't disagree... However, carrying your entire cache of bitcoins around on your phone probably isn't the best idea. Mobile applications are best used for mobile scenarios (ie. keep a small amount on your phone, like the cash you would keep in your wallet)
Don't forget to keep usb/paper backups of your private keys and electrum seed.
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:39:16
Transaction fee is currently set to 0.0001 which is exactly 100 bits

You're not giving your private keys to Facebook. When you encrypt with a three word passphrase no one else has access to the private key but you.

@_date: 2014-05-27 00:09:21
We'll let our users decide that. Bitcoin gives you a certain flexibility that is not available with traditional bank transfers and credit cards. Once a transfer is past six confirmations on the blockchain it is statistically improbable for it to be reversed. This process typically takes an hour. This is something Venmo can't offer you. We also allow you to transfer payments less than a penny, I'm pretty sure this is lower than Venmo's minimum transfer requirement. We're also available globally, anywhere you can access the internet and facebook.
@_date: 2014-09-19 21:07:57
This helps fuel the unpredictability :D
@_date: 2014-06-04 20:24:12
Yes, because you don't hold the private keys. If there is anything we have learned in Bitcoin-land, it's that exchanges and companies come and go. If you have a large cache of Bitcoin, I HIGHLY recommend you store it cold. If Coinbase got hacked or went down tomorrow, you'd be SOL.    
    
Also, you can't hack into a piece of paper or usb drive (that's not connected). Hence the term "cold"    
    
Keeping a 'spending' amount on QuickCoin or a wallet of your choice is the best security practice, keep the rest cold.

The balance isn't actually negative, it just caused a glitch and displays that in the UI temporarily. If you hit refresh you will see your actual balance (which was never negative).
I REPEAT: this is a bug with the UI.
If you send money in while the balance is negative, the transaction that didn't occur + the new transaction will register and you will see the updated balance. No money is lost, ever.
Also this is all available information on the Blockchain. You can view this by clicking the gear on the right, copying the bitcoin address and visiting:

Hold on, hold on. Who said you have to keep your bitcoins in Circle? The way I see it, Jeremy and company have designed an amazing user-intuitive service, with an awesome feature that allows you to purchase BTC with a CC. The majority of people out there that are making their first purchase won't spend more than $50, and I think that's fine to keep on a web-wallet like Circle or Coinbase (not risking much). That being said, use Electrum! Make multiple paper wallets and USB backups. Delete the original wallet files off your computer and go dark. Some of you might have read recently about the man who had 750 BTC stolen by connecting to a shady wifi while on vacation. Always keep a small amount on a mobile client or web wallet, and the rest on paper. Storing your private keys in an encrypted volume with a strong password can also work (just don't mess around with it while connected to a public wifi). When transferring from your crypto savings cold wallet, only use a trusted internet connection and never use public wifi. Another big mistake when managing cryptocurrency, don't use Windows, keep your mac/linux box up to date, patch all known issues.    
    
Don't store your life savings on a centralized service, Bitcoin was designed for you to always have ownership and control. Use multisig if/when possible.

If you want to go an extra step, double-check your recovery seed is good by importing on to another computer, and then delete the wallet file from both computers. You can find the file located in your home folder under ".electrum/wallets"

This is why I am a firm believer in keeping the majority of your crypto savings cold (on paper wallets). Use a web-wallet or mobile client like you would use your real wallet (keep petty cash in it).     
   
Edit: I've been banged up before by PayPal, I know the feeling, it's awful.

Your three passphrases + facebook uid + encrypted hash (on our side) deterministically generates your public/private key addresses in the client. You can increase security by making the three passwords longer or more complicated if you wish.
We will add more documentation to make this more clear.
We'll be adding an auto-revert feature if the user on the other end doesn't claim it.
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:23:37
We are aware of this issue and fixing it. If you try to send more than you have, it will not send, and causes a weird balance - temporarily. In the future please post a support ticket, thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-02 04:42:43
as I have stated before, we are completely transparent and open about who we are. If we were trying to scam you, we wouldn't have put our real names on this product.
Also: it is over an encrypted SSL connection. Take a look next time you log in:
When you upgrade your security you are creating a deterministic wallet that is generated client-side with: facebook uid + three word passphrase + large encrypted hash (on our side).
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:31:05
All of the transactions with QuickCoin are currently done on-chain. We automatically include a 100 bit tx fee which is paid directly to the network to process your transaction in the next block promptly. We are working on implementing a fee-less option that is on-chain as well to keep everything transparent.

Bitcoin transactions are actually on-blockchain. Watch them yourself real time on helloblock.io
Giving out private keys is difficult, as we don't want our users to be overwhelmed or potentially get phished or hacked. We're working on an elegant blend of easy to use, with great security. Not as easy as it would sound ;)

@_date: 2015-05-22 03:05:31
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:17:22
We are going to be implementing the ability to do 2/3 and more very soon, so you will be able to hold (on your side) the majority of keys required to sign a transaction. For example, you could create and hold two keys, block.io could generate one, and you never have to trust us. The only downside is that green address functionality wouldn't work in that situation. We'll be looking into nTimeLock :)

When your security is upgraded, only you. Your Facebook UID + Three word passphrase + encrypted hash creates your deterministic seed, which generates your keys client side with Javascript.
@_date: 2014-05-23 22:20:17
I think this is a really cool idea btw, I can't wait to see parking meters accepting Bitcoin! I hate change and credit cards are cumbersome.

They text you back before anything is ordered and make sure you agree with the price. It basically cost me $25 on top of my order, which from where I live is about the cost of cab fare from the city to my town. About a 15 minute drive. The ability to order bomb-tacos vs shit-tacos, priceless.

Our strong reason and concept behind MTL is the ability to mint crypto through PoPP (Proof-of-processed-payment). As I was going to type this, I was minting MTL from a transaction I had made earlier. Bitcoin was meant to be an electronic P2P cash system, but instead it is a better digital store of value whereas MTL functions more like electronic P2P cash with a platform that is seamlessly integrating existing banking and payment (credit/debit) rails. In reality crypto is more than just Bitcoin, however Bitcoin is still awesome.

Electrum. Step up the game with a Trezor and even if your computer were to be compromised, all of the signing happens on the secure element, so you're good. You can also make backup copies on paper (or memorize them if you're really hardcore).

With Purse you would have a smart contract with multi-signature. You would sign off on the transaction when you had received the item. In the even of a dispute both parties would plead their case to Purse and it would be moderated in the same way as PayPal, however at the very end, no one would lose their merchant account (PayPal). You would still have the same protection here at Purse as you would have on Etsy/PP.

That may be true on one level, but the difference is they are all using an open protocol (bitcoin) and they have the choice. For those that are savvy enough they can bring their own software like Airbitz, Mycelium or Electrum.
@_date: 2015-11-10 17:14:58
Exactly. Centralized can be great when it comes to customer service and ease-of-use. In the case of Purse.io you have a mixture... Remove the PayPal element that everyone hates and replace it with Bitcoin. No more frozen or disabled merchant accounts.

As far as malleability, this can be solved with nTimeLock. I love how people bring up malleability as the explanation for Gox getting hacked, when in reality it accounted for a minuscule amount of damage to an already broken system.
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:33:59
when I say people I'm not referring to I'm pointing out that tx malleability has accounted for very little in terms of exchange hacks.

The order book keeps a record of all the open trades, the client either matches a trade or it doesn't and your coins stay safe.

Totally. You can create cold storage with Electrum (sans Trezor) if you want, it requires a little work though to do it securely.

Millions of dollars are flowing through alt/alt exchanges every day. It would seem every other week there is a story of one of them going down in flames. Tell me how this isn't big for Bitcoin again? I guess it might be even bigger for Dogecoin :)

I'm not against centralized control in every situation. I love ChangeTip, CoinBase, Circle... The founders of these companies all echo the same sentiments: don't keep more than petty cash on their wallet services.
Some vault services are marketing to this demographic, but I would say if you have that much bitcoin, do some research and explore multi-sig/hardware storage options.

It's mind-boggling we've come this far to use centralized services to host the private keys to our decentralized coins. I understand the need for trusted third parties, but come on.

Mercury will not cause bloat, as it's not storing any data in the blockchain.    
    
This is nothing like LocalBitcoins, which matches a seller with a buyer on a peer to peer network for a fiat&lt;-&gt;crypto transaction. Mercury currently only handles crypto&lt;-&gt;crypto.    
    
You will always be putting trust into a "Gateway" as Ripple calls it, unless you are using something like NuBits, then you are relying on the LPC's, NuShares holders and the network itself.

Thank you for the update! I haven't used CoinKite in a while and I know they've made leaps and bounds with the multi-signature API. They are most certainly advanced.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:54:52
Totally understandable. The code is being released soon, in addition I don't think anyone will blame you if they fail for any reason! I like that they have decentralized voting, something Bitcoin can learn from.

I'm sure a future implementation will allow you to back up your wallet. The private keys are stored locally.

It's important to differentiate. BitGo is a 2-of-3 solution, GreenAddress is a 2-of-2 solution, BCI is a classic HD wallet and ~~CoinKite is similar to CoinBase in that you don't hold your private keys.~~
EDIT: Coinkite gives you the option to generate private keys offline (upload the xpub), m-of-15 multisig, and more.
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:28:10
I think we're moving away from the point, and that is, when you use a service like Circle or Coinbase (an off-chain web-wallet/app) you're dealing in IOU's, not bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:21:13
Circle and Coinbase are most likely going to manage your keys properly, however other services, not so much. In general, it's better to have sole ownership of the private keys.
@_date: 2015-03-18 04:03:31
Just as many people would argue they're in control of their accounts on  [x] centralized bitcoin service.

Maybe we will hardfork with OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and implement 20 MB blocks simultaneously :)

Keys are generated on the Trezor, Electrum communicates with the hardware, Trezor does the signing.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:36:05
Maybe I'm misunderstanding things... If I create a malleable tx, would it be possible to execute trades for coins that I didn't have on Mercury - or would they just get stuck?
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:05:33
@_date: 2015-10-27 21:34:29

I am really stoked for this. Electrum is the best Desktop Bitcoin client hands down, on any platform.

Yes it does, your account balance represents an IOU with the bank.

I totally agree, furthermore why do we need a fiat interface on the exchange? Nubits will act as "USD". With all of the options to purchase and sell Bitcoin, I'm not sure Mercury needs a fiat operation.

Backslash transactions are off-chain. No added fee, just miner fees when sending to the network.
@_date: 2015-02-06 08:36:08
Not to sound confrontational or anything, but they are definitely competitors. Mycelium could add multi-sig support tomorrow and that would put them in the same ballpark. I'm sure they are planning on doing this as it's the next logical step. GA gives you the ability to control your own coins in settings under "Your 2 of 3 accounts" enter your own xpub keys and you're in complete control (albeit maybe not simple to recover your private keys)... That's what I want to know, how do we get the xprv key from the GA mnemonic.

Well, I have to say, you guys are really on top of it and I'm super impressed. Keep up all the great work! Please try to figure out why GreenBits is crashing on send with Android (happening to me on a Note 3 with Android 4.4.4). Have 2 coffees on me +@_date: 2015-02-06 06:20:12
This is really, really cool. Excellent work GreenAddress team! I want to point out a few minor bugs and propose some features.    
    
BUGS    
1) App crashes upon send (still goes through though, but doesn't inspire confidence) :(    
2) Despite changing from bits to btc send confirmation still shows bits and says "2FA gauth code"    
    
SUGGESTIONS    
1. Send max button    
2. Easier verification of GA instant transactions    
    
All around fantastic job, and I love the trezor/ledger functionality! kudos +@_date: 2015-03-10 19:14:29
They don't think it's a viable method for transferring money. Set your boss up with a Coinbase wallet and then transfer $20 to a friend in Egypt and have him shoot it over to your Boss while you're in front of him, have him cash it out to USD right there. Watch his eyes light up.

@_date: 2015-02-10 20:10:37
Super lame. Created an interesting setup for this exact scenario. Everything on Mycelium mirrored on my Trezor :)    
   
Solution: Remove fees from LocalTrader (limit purchase and sale amount for app users to $100), add tx confidence as a general feature for Mycelium... Make a LocalTrader website (like localbitcoins) for which Mycelium controls the API keys, charge on the site.
@_date: 2015-02-06 07:02:35
