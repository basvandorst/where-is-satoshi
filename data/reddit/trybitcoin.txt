Thanks for pointing this out- We've had lots of complaints of our opt-out buttons not working, and this is indeed a bug. We want users to use Facebook to send to friends to see how Bitcoin works and how social it can be, but we understand not everyone wants to do this! We'll get to work fixing this.

We would use pre-filled addresses that are on the blockchain, but we realized that the tx fees of having micro-donations on the blockchain would cost us much more and make TryBTC economically unfeasible. 
Instead, we send money off-blockchain via Coinbase to eliminate these fees, although the temporary wallet's transactions won't be public. We'd still love to introduce users to the concept of the blockchain, so we link them to Bitcoin Foundation's address (one with lots of traffic) just to show them how it works!

Hey LeTenken- Just to clarify, all of the addresses that are not Sean's Outpost are placeholders that we privately use to identify charities. Because charities such as the American Red Cross don't currently accept BTC donations, we transfer it to them in USD (which is off-blockchain). I definitely agree it would be great to see on the blockchain, but at this point it's the best we can do until we get more adoption or more solid BTC donation options.
Sean's Outpost donations don't seem to be working properly for us ( I am emailing the founder to make sure he's been receiving our donations (we've generated over $115 for him through our site!)

Thank you for your feedback! We think that the educational part of the website is valuable, even if users opt out of claiming their (free) satoshis  via Coinbase. Our referral fee is not scamming anyone, and is the primary way for us to generate revenue to keep giving out free satoshis. Without it, we would just be another text-only website. I hope this clears things up!

We're working to get it back up ASAP, thanks for your patience!
@_date: 2013-09-02 21:30:11
I completely agree. I'm working on pushing out a responsive version of the website this week, this was v0.1!
@_date: 2013-09-02 22:45:19
The only reason we need users to enter their e-mail address in the first place is that we know where to send the Bitcoin. If users registered through Coinbase alone, how would they have any way of us giving them their remaining balance? This is by far the easiest way to do things.

Thank you for the feedback - we had actually gotten so much traffic that we temporarily ran out of bitcoin! The issue should be fixed now, and will have a more helpful tooltip if it ever happens again.

Hey everyone, we're currently experiencing a security breach which has resulted in us temporarily freezing Bitcoin transactions. Because of this, claiming your wallet at the end will not work. We hope to have this fixed in the next hour. Thank you all for your patience.
@_date: 2013-09-02 21:31:13
We are currently in the process of adding support for other countries. Stay tuned!

Hey, thanks so much for adding us to the subreddit! We're impressed by the amount of feedback this has gotten. Hopefully this will help onboard more people into the space, and make Bitcoin less intimidating to new-comers. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 21:05:02
You raise an interesting point! We're not affiliated at all with Satoshi Dice at the moment and don't make any money from having them featured on our site, however, we understand that it could lead to prejudice (and that is exactly the opposite of what we want). 
What do you guys think would be a more appropriate replacement?
@_date: 2013-09-03 22:57:08
Thank you for your positive feedback. Multiple people have reported that the blocking of social media is messing up our share page- we're looking into a solution now. Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-09-02 21:40:20
Great suggestion, I'll add that in ASAP.
@_date: 2013-09-03 22:55:48
Hey there- 
The way it works is we send the money out of your "temporary wallet" on our website to your "permanent wallet" which you can set up on Coinbase. Because they are separate, and you actually initialize your Coinbase account on the subsequent email we send to your email address, we have NO control over your Coinbase account. 
The way we spend from your wallet is to issue Bitcoin commands on "your behalf". The "temporary wallet"'s public and private keys (the codes which give users control over a wallet's address) are always kept with us, but the tutorial makes it seem as if you have control over the transactions, for educational purposes.
I hope this helps!

Hey everyone, I am the founder of TryBTC and was surprised to see our site pop up on this subreddit! My co-founder and I are thrilled with all of the feedback and will be hard at work on improving the things we see on this post. Please feel free to add anything you would like to see done in the future!
@_date: 2013-09-02 21:15:58
What do you guys think would be the best charities to have up there? I actually think I got most of the 5 sites listed from CharityNavigator!
@_date: 2013-09-03 22:58:28
We have plans to add in support for other wallets, but the purpose of the website is for people without wallets (hence the description on the tutorial page, and the opt-out on the home page by the name "Already use bitcoin?").
@_date: 2013-09-03 01:14:12
We are now implementing a captcha to prevent this.
@_date: 2013-09-03 09:00:00
Thanks for pointing this out, should be fixed now!
@_date: 2013-09-02 20:58:32
This is exactly correct. Because of the transaction verification time, there is no way for users to see the transaction during the tutorial. Additionally, if you check out the "How does this work?" popup, we explain that to cut down on transaction costs we send our batch donations to the charities at the end of the day. Hope that helps resolve this!

Thank you very much for your comments! The site should be forcing https now. :)
