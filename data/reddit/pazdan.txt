You could setup a multisig vault on Coinbase.  You own 2/3 of the private keys,  Coinbase has the other one.  They never have full access to your funds without you in this scenario.  Also there is a github tool out there to pull your funds from it in case their site ever goes completely down.

His last big hit was like 10 years ago. In tech world he is a dinosaur and out of the loop. I'm not saying he won't pull it off, but I am thinking he's hyping it like crazy because he knows he needs a huge user base at the beginning to get it going. If niche Bitcoin users don't use it he sure as hell will never get mainstream users and he knows it.

Lol are you kidding me? Google my name man. I'm not hiding anything. That's the whole point of my name on here. 
You guys love that word shill shill shill. I'm not a shill. Majority of my comments before didn't have anything to do with Coinbase so why would I have to disclose each post that I work for Coinbase? Seriously I assume you work somewhere if you are calling everyone a shill here that have certain things to say. It's ether that it you have a really God awful life outside of the internet.  No one is as mean as you are or (maybe the same person or work together?)
With that said, I used Coinbase before working for them as a merchant, then I worked for them and now I don't. I have been on many sides of Coinbase (as a customer, merchant, and employee) and after all of this I only respect them more as a company. If that makes me a shill, then count me in.  I also advocate strongly for solar companies, Tesla, and SpaceX, etc. 
Like the others said, what I posted was not an opinion it was just information.  How can you talk to people as an adult not knowing the difference?

Where on this subreddit, did I recommend a service of Coinbase while working there?  After working there for 2 years all pb1x could find is a couple comments that were more around the topic of blocksize increase than anything.  If I work for Walmart and support Unions, do I have to post I work for Walmart on reddit?  My point is, you don't know what legal requirements there are around this, I do, so buzz off and psycho harass someone else on here that isn't in line with your message.  You know the number is growing rapidly so you'll be working overtime :D

I worked for Coinbase for about two years and can say they are some of the best, brightest, and most trustworthy people in the industry. They are literally brainiac Harvard and Stanford grads and have VC funding from some of the most legit names in Palo Alto that would never allow something like insolvency to happen under their noses.  We should all be greatful they are in our space of fintech and not some place else doing amazing things. 
The accusations based on little evidence are really unfortunate but part of running a business.  I remember a few months back some attacks were similarly made on Uphold. Not sure what ever happened to that but it seems they are still here, still run by a billionaire with tons of funding. 
I try not to post often on this sub, but this one I felt I had to speak up. 
Edit: I forgot to mention I have no affiliation with them anymore. 
Edit 2: Wow ok, people are picking apart my comment now that it's top of this post.  I forgot to mention MIT grads, Rice, etc. and others that are still VERY reputable.  It's not the only thing that matters (trust me I didn't go to any Ivy league school...), I was just trying to make a quick point on here, that it's not run by B players, it's run by reputable A players (that are well educated and had really great past job experience too).

@_date: 2016-08-14 03:41:58
With the technology as it is today I agree. If the tech improves, paths hope is you get as many transactions on chain as possible so as to keep the trustless model in action for everything.  If Bitcoin is not the place that strives for this, other chains will try to make it happen. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:05:31
How so?  This statement seems purely speculative. Other coins have successfully done it and moved along just fine, retaining most of their value and likely better off long term. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:48:21
But I like Coinbase, and I will gladly continue to tell people this.  You following me calling me a shill always will only cause people concern about you more than anything.
Take a look around you, Bitfinex got hacked, Coinbase is fully insured, 98+% coins are cold storage.  A+ players, the list goes on and on.  Shill Shill Shill, no it's more like fact fact fact.

Most serious companies are looking at alts like ether now bc of the limited transactions. Blocksize increase fix will help. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 03:37:38
Really?  You don't know this is a thing? Like every disruptive technology follows this... 
The link you provided works great right now.  But if we get 200 more companies like steam on the network, everyone starts buying up bitcoin for ecommerce and remittance and soon you'll realize you're in a world of hurt much faster than anticipated. 
In 6 months, we might be waiting until 5 am when the network isn't busy in order to buy $5 worth of games on steam with a 40 cent fee.  Sounds amazing.

Excellent response. I'm happy there are passionate people here that still believe in bitcoin. 
You're right I was using certain words to get the attention of people on here. Regardless how it is said, the reality is there are major players in the space that rely on a network that can handle transactions in a timely manner and for low fees. I think ETH is getting attention bc it doesn't have this problem but if/when btc solves the issue the debate will reside and the community will hopefully reunite. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 12:24:38
Probably too late, the morale battle has been lost. Many looking elsewhere like ETH bc these guys have their heads up their asses and love to blow smoke and think things are awesome.

True, will have to see what happens the next few months. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 09:38:40
The thing is with gas prices 10 years ago you had to buy a more efficient gas car.  Today you can instead buy an electric because it's available and much more efficient (in terms of mpg equivalence).  And if gas prices continue to go up, and electric battery costs continue to go down, this migration will only increases.  If gas prices stay low, it will prevent or slow this rate. 
The same can be said with Bitcoin transaction fees.  Fees are higher, so some are getting the hybrid gas car (off-chain transactions etc) while others are going the electric (alternative coins) route. 
It's unfortunate but very evident now that this is happening. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 22:31:47
From what I heard they just haven't determined the cap of ETH yet. There will be a cutoff or slow down. 
Just so you all know, I want btc to succeed. I'm not the bad guy, just pointing out something that is called reality. There is a distortion field on this sub and it is extremely concerning.

@_date: 2016-04-15 03:41:34
Increasingly rare bc transactions are going to alts? Look at the total market cap of alts the last 3 months and compare to the market cap of btc. Btc stayed flat bc alts increased over 3x. That is an immense increase bc guys like me are concerned about the future here. Increase the blocksize and let the price skyrocket. Everyone will be happy again. Miners won't need bigger fees if the rewarded btc are worth 10x more than they are now. Won't happen with stagnating usage. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 17:43:12
Ok, to clarify, what is your view on the topic?  I'm curious because you seem to mostly respond to any post regarding blocksize.

@_date: 2016-04-15 03:46:27
Hardfork mania will come back when btc stagnates considerably even after the halving.  I could be wrong but there's a good chance of that. Reason why many are hedging slightly more in alts now.

I think you are misunderstanding the process of bitcoin transactions.  Most merchants or recipients of a transaction can typically take a pending transaction on the protocol as legitimate.  The funds are not available until a certain number of confirmations, but there is really no need to fear double spend, especially on small transactions like college buzzcards.  So they can swipe, pay and move on.  Also bitpay and coinbase assist with this, making it more seamless and instant.

So you've never spent $20 on something you want, like, or care about?  You have only invested $20 or spent $20 on necessities?  You must be the most financially sound person in the world.

They basically were talking about how the digital currency revolution is underway, with NFC transactions and your cellphone being like a wallet now. They then went on to talk about Bitcoin and how it's esoteric but is also part of the digital currency revolution. It was a fairly positive "introduction" to many that were watching. I'm sure it'll be posted on their site soon, or someone here can probably find it. It was at the very end of the episode, just so happened to be flipping through the channels and saw it :)

I live in the burbs of Chicago and am really sorry to hear about this.  It's really frustrating but this is pretty much all that most people know about Bitcoin right now.

What if you get your bitcoin for providing services to others, like working or doing something on Fiverr?  Then you avoid the 1% fees.  Those fees only exist when you are buying bitcoin from US currency.  If you stay in the bitcoin world, it becomes very cheap and efficient.  
Say I own a company, I sell items online for bitcoin.  I gather up a few bitcoin and then pay my bills, and other businesses (b2b) with bitcoin.  This could be the big benefit soon.

I've been hearing this on here for 2 years now.  People have gone elsewhere for cheaper txn fees.  BTC is not meant for this anymore, and I would be surprised if it went back to focusing on being a payment channel on the primary blockchain.
@_date: 2016-03-18 16:44:59
That's interesting, I didn't consider your fourth point before.  In some ways that has been happening ever since Bitcoin existed and btc price increased.  
One other thing I forgot to mention is the delayed confirmations with transactions that do not put a high enough fee.  Can you run through how we can prevent that going forward?  So if I put a small fee and the thing takes days to confirm rather than 10 min. Or worse it never confirms. So those micro transactions I'm thinking about might be pushed off of the Bitcoin blockchain entirely. I'm OK with that but I'm wondering what solution is there for these going forward, that is tied to btc rather than say ETH or other alt coins that I don't want to use. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 05:17:06


This is the same thing people say why they never quit their jobs and start a business with a great idea.  They say they are waiting for the perfect idea.
It's not about perfect solutions, it's about making rational decisions under current circumstances.  I guess it depends what matters most to you, if you care to see bitcoin usage continue to grow, or if you just care to keep it a small ecosystem for some settlements like 1st world yacht purchases.
This reminds me a lot of our current net neutrality debate, where we have some people totally ok with people paying more for prioritization.  There are many reasons why this is unfair but I can tell you this will be the end of the network for most 3rd world countries, and/or it will delay their usage of the network by many years (until we have LN, etc).

Ah got it, so it's a discount until everyone uses it, then it's not a discount. 
Good thing core has 2mb on their roadmap for 2017 so we don't have to fret about fee prioritization as much.
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:54:49
I'm super techy and having a hard time sticking with btc now that I know the nozzle is arbitrarily tightened.  All these theorists will say we need this or that but the reality is we have unconfirmed transactions now.  Upgrade to 2mb or more and slow down the blocksize increase once we have more solutions like LN and sidechains, etc.  Those solutions are just not ready yet. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 04:34:14
It's def. not pleasant being crammed in there, so some may say it's not worth the higher price, for the relatively slow commute :D

How will fees come down when the userbase an transactions are increasing (increased 100% last year)?  
Really though, do you know?  I'm honestly very curious if there is some sort of solution already built in that I'm missing.
@_date: 2016-03-06 02:51:03
You can still hold up to the principles of decentralization without forcing people out of bitcoin entirely (which regardless what you think, will and is starting to happen).  Some people just can't afford higher fees, or it doesn't make sense to do certain transactions with higher fees.  Problem is the solution(s) to this problem don't exist yet.
@_date: 2016-03-26 04:51:30
Wow, some people here really don't understand the value of low fees. If btc doesn't maintain a competitive advantage over other solutions in terms of low fees, it will lose long term. It needs to be at least on par with other alts. 
End of story, I don't need to write 5 paragraphs to explain it.

Roger Ver probably doesn't know what Bernie is all about.  In reality, Bernie has acquired the majority of independent voters, and is in a highly libertarian state (Vermont) which pretty much all love him.  To call him a socialist or blanket him as something like that simply shows he lacks true understanding of who he is.
@_date: 2016-03-18 14:36:12
read what I wrote..., "Miner transaction fees might spike faster than core is anticipating."
This is a huge issue, if say 20% of bitcoin transactions are for things 50 cents or less.  All of a sudden you tack on a 10 or even 20 cent fee and you are talking huge percentage of the total cost of the funds being sent.  We are then no longer as competitive as other traditional means of financial transfer.  
@_date: 2016-01-01 00:29:14

This really isn't that big of news.  All wallet solutions need to do this now that fees are ever increasing.
The variable fees will definitely still confuse new adopters of btc, something that should have been delayed as long as possible via a blocksize increase.

@_date: 2016-03-19 19:04:08

Why lol?  I am.  What do you do for a living?  Just curious as I manage a multimillion dollar technology budget and team.  
Seriously, am I talking to kids on here?  
I get there always will be unconfirmed transactions, especially considering the fact they all start that way.  I'm just stating reality that there will be tons more now, and the quality of service will plummet here quickly.  Try sending an email and then waiting a day to get it.  Or, better yet, tell people they can get emails sent quickly if they pay 3 cents.  How long will people rely on email? 
Seriously, don't tell me about auto calculating fees, LN, sidechains, etc.  It's just reality, the solutions aren't here yet, but the blocksize limit IS.
@_date: 2016-03-21 14:05:14


It would lower them.  Btw, it's not forced if the majority of miners and nodes run a version of btc with 2mb fork.  
Last point, no need to say WTF, let's all stay civilized.  
@_date: 2016-03-17 17:01:22
At some point your transaction may not make financial sense to, if that is what you are hinting at.
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:15:17
I understand what you mean, problem is we don't have those solutions here today. We do have full blocks though. We need to up the blocksize ASAP otherwise you'll lose a lot of people that were previously die hard bitcoin fans. It's already starting. You don't have to believe me, the market will show this very soon unless segwit or 2mb hardcore happens immediately. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 23:26:19


Actually, we need a combination of many things.  If you look at core's roadmap they are increasing the blocksize in 2017, classic and the people that believe in it simply think this needs to be sooner.  We are all want the same thing here, just some would rather keep fees lower for longer as we rapidly grow the userbase.
@_date: 2016-03-16 17:23:27
Hmm I don't see a 2mb limit increase on here.  We are expecting 100% tx growth within 12 months, so that is 30%+ by the time this is released.  Anyone know what the fees might go up to, or how long we'll have to wait for confirmations as the year progresses?
@_date: 2016-03-17 15:20:38
I agree on this. Problem is a rally might speed up the rate of new Bitcoin holders and users. This can present problems with our current 1mb limit. Miner transaction fees might spike faster than core is anticipating.  So their plan to solve the issue with segwit and 2mb bump in late 2017 likely isn't soon enough. This is why some believe btc classic is a good option, if anyone is wondering.

@_date: 2016-03-31 22:01:51

@_date: 2017-03-16 21:51:46
I wonder if they will be offering the ability to vary the fee, bc sometimes sending from them can take forever if they tack on too low fees...
So like, if I want my $10 in 10 minutes, I can add $2 to $4 fee to it to ensure that moves to the next block.
@_date: 2016-03-31 19:04:50

This is super concerning.  Blockchain tx prioritization is very similar to net neutrality debate.  Should the internet have prioritization for certain traffic?  TMobile giving unlimited data usage for some video streaming services, or comcast getting paid extra by netflix to keep their traffic above others during peak times is a clear sign of this.
Best option is to constantly increase capacity via innovations and efficiency.  This will ensure btc will rapidly grow just like the internet has.
@_date: 2016-03-01 23:29:03
I think it's great as a settlement system, just don't think we should be picking one or the other.  Forcing it into a low transaction settlement system is saying, this is the only thing we want it to do, when in reality there are many possibilities.

Correct.  Roger has a right to express his concerns, just because some do not agree, does not mean he is wrong.  That is the great thing of a community, lots of different views.  He cares a lot about affordable onchain payment/ecommerce with bitcoin, on layer 1.  Don't have to agree but that's his stance.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:02:34
Bitcoin isn't that hard to predict.  Many people predicted the bottleneck we are now living with.  Gavin predicted way back it would happen this month.  He was right.
Take your software dev cap off for a minute and think about how you are literally going to slow down the rate of new bitcoin users if you don't do your softfork of 2mb hardfork right now, today, not down the road.
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:26:12

@_date: 2016-06-20 03:46:20
So you assume spam but have no proof.  Could be someone testing a new onchain solution that brings millions of new people to Bitcoin. Could be people moving funds or assets around. Could be anything. The point is, if something is transacted then it's not spam, it's transacted. This is just my personal view you by no means have to agree.

Any reason to be concerned about the new more complex code?  Just curious, or is it pretty much 100% vetted on the testnet by now?  
@_date: 2016-06-20 11:37:50
So one concern is a massive blockchain that has to replicate across a ton of nodes constantly. Thing is we are talking about relatively small amounts of data still and as tech advances peoples cheap devices and Internet will continue to be able to help be nodes etc. It is a balancing act though I agree.

@_date: 2016-06-30 12:27:32
Suits and geeks aren't the only people on this planet. There are real world use cases for btc that apparently some like yourself aren't able to see. 
Strictly in terms of economics, btc has been priced out for a huge portion of people and if not solved in time, competition will continue to take hold of new adopters in the space.  You can hate on me all you want but I actually care a ton about Bitcoin too, and am just stating quantifiable observations. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:57:55
Problem is those smaller transactions could be records of something with more value than the price of the btc transacted. Who is to say my micro transaction is less important than big BTC holders? I think forcing us to a large transactions only network is unfortunate. Prioritizing is not the way. 
If this happened in the early days of the Internet, it was be a much less used system. You'd probably see government, big businesses and some universities on it. 
It is obvious to me that you raise the blocksize and provide more time for developers of side chains and LN to come to fruition.  You don't create a fake limit to speed up technology advances, it doesn't work that way. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 02:47:08

@_date: 2016-06-30 02:35:29
Not quite, most are trying to avoid a collapse or a significant loss to competition.  Really I think we all want the same thing here, a secure system for many to use.  Increased blocksize supporters want to avoid higher fees as long as possible to continue to stay competitive as long as possible.  
2 billion people live on $3 or less a day.  If fees continue to stay at this rate, or increase, they will be priced out forever.
@_date: 2016-06-29 02:09:46
I think he's trying to say that smaller value on-chain transactions need to occur in order to gain a wider audience, thus increasing the overall market cap of btc.
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:03:35
I believe the whole idea that making changes that require more costly equipment and lower latency internet will somehow kill decentralization, hasn't been proven yet and shouldn't be assumed.  In fact, some could argue, that leaving such an extreme low cap (smaller than a floppy disk can store might I add) thus allowing rapidly increased miner fees has centralized the use of bitcoin to only the wealthiest of potential users.  It no longer makes sense to store, send and receive btc for 2 billion people in the world that live off of $3 a day, when each transaction will have a 5 to 10% fee tacked on.
I truly appreciate the concern Greg has, I have it too, though it is something that should be balanced with rationale of cost of node equipment and internet lowering.  
The way forward is to maintain a system that is built so everyone can use it however they like, while maintaining a secure decentralized network.  It's not one of the other, we need to have both.  In other words we need decentralization AND true democracy of currency at the first layer (not under the 2nd or 3rd, with LN and thunder, etc).  If LN and thunder, sidechains win out, that is great but it should not be preordained by the very few developing the system.  
@_date: 2016-06-19 03:55:58
Actually no, the Internet doesn't work the same way. Your internet speeds you are referring to are arbitrary limits set by your internet service provider. Technically, the Internet can handle much faster speeds and has consistently increased as economics make sense. Hence why I can get google gig fiber for $100 today while I used a 56k modem when I was a kid. 
With the 1mb blocksize I can never pay my way past 7 transactions per second no matter how rich and willing I am.  This is a limit that no one can pay their way out of. 
If the Internet were built with the same thought process, it would be limited to say a global bandwidth of 1gb of data per hour. Anyone can use these data packets but they have to pay for them and higher payments get those packets sent first. Anyone can send information if they are willing to pay.  This would limit the Internet to extremely important email messages and knowledge sharing between universities and governments only because at the end of the day the ENTIRE WORLD would be fighting over 24gb of data transfer daily.

...unless if usage increases to the point where something like a 20mb block is nearly filled the same % we see today. Then fees would apply. 
Edit: to clarify, you said unlimited block space, I would agree with that but technically you could set a minimum fee requirement and eventually the spammer will price themselves out.

No one said all of London..., it shoud not be limited to an elite few with huge sums of money.  2 billion people live on $3 or less a day, if transaction fees are a certain amount like they are now, or higher, it really doesn't allow for btc to be used as an option for them.

I think a better analogy would be him noticing while staring out the window that they are unable to keep proper altitude due to too much weight on the plane. He reports it to the crew and cockpit multiple times but they say they ran their calculations and all is good, to go back to his seat.  Meanwhile others notice the same and start to notify the crew as well, while those in aisle seats or were sleeping do not see what all the fuss is about. Some of them are even mad about the ruckus Ver and other window sitters are causing on their nice flight. 
Only time will tell if that plane stays in the air or not.

nothing is "likely", but "hopeful" maybe.  I wouldn't fixate on the hard fork aspect so much as pros/cons to increasing blocksize.  If the pros outway the cons, then long term it should be done.  Otherwise you'll leave payment processing open to other on-chain solutions that people prefer over layered solutions pegged to btc that have their own set of risks.

I guess security and the level of that security is up for debate.  I would say something more decentralized that paypal and on an open sourced blockchain not run by one entity is inherently way more secure than a centralized DB by paypal.  Even if it's just a few nodes, over their business run DBs.  Having thousands on TOR seems like an extreme view that is not entirely clear if its top priority.

Bitcoin provides value in digital form securely. People believe in it enough that one bitcoin is worth $235 and people are using it like cash and gold. It's way more successful than you are giving it credit. Technological success and consumer adoption are two different things.

Spam prevention, force mail clients to enable "satos hi send" whereby each email sent has a small amount of satoshi. If you get an email without it, it hits you spam. If you get a legitimate email with satoshi you can send it back to the sender.

That's simply not true, we already discussed this thoroughly before.  The company is very strict about this, and if anyone does so, they are doing it against company policies, and have and will be reprimanded accordingly.  I've seen that happen only on one occasion.  The company is very ethical, and it's just plain frustrating to see you constantly bashing on them.
With that said, I no longer work there, and when I did, I never discussed things pertaining to Coinbase without revealing myself as an employee there.
I'm fairly certain you work for a competitor of theirs, or are close friends with or something, because you often times show up during conversations that are pertaining to both.  You bash CB and back Core/nullc.

Right, but if we are talking IoT here, then it might be a few billion devices batching their tx into one each.  The network would have to scale significantly for that and I don't see 21 or others recoding to move these into 2nd or 3rd layer LN. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 23:49:20
if you live in North America and a few other countries this is somewhat true.  You have to remember there are about 3 billion people without a bank account, and even more people without stable native currencies.  So if you're in the US the things bitcoin solves might not be as drastically obvious as to someone in Argentina or Russia right now.

what does blocksize have anything to do with this?  You're trying to mesh two totally separate topics into one.  Keep in mind no one has proven 100% that CSW isn't satoshi either.
@_date: 2016-05-06 15:22:11
lots of code, lots of changes, seems way more complex than just doing a blocksize increase.  ETH already did one just fine.  
@_date: 2016-05-05 11:57:28
You core loving guys sound like George Bush, "either you're with us or you're against us".  Gavin cares more about bitcoin than you'll ever know, he helped bring it to this world.
To take his access away is a showing that core is no longer able to effectively work with people with different views on strategy, especially from the brightest in the industry.  Seems very concerning to me.

Get a Raspi and case I make at Adafruit with bitcoin: 
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:54:44
I like you too.  My thoughts are confirmed by the fact that you are getting downvoted.  :)
@_date: 2016-05-04 03:12:05
Can btc handle the increase of on-chain tx this will cause?  I know the majority are off-chain, but to get btc in and out of these, and transmit between non 21 inc. computers will likely cause a surge in txs.  Maybe Satoshi and Gavin are on to something with a blocksize increase?
@_date: 2015-02-18 03:58:13
No we sell them to Adafruit usually in batches of 50 or 100.  
Go to MCM Electronics for the Raspi 2: 
and my case on their site (though without a photo for some reason): 
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:08:54
First thing I thought you were referring to was the ridiculously photogenic guy in the top right ad.
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:51:59
This is bad news so maybe the price will go up, like last time the auctioned of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-18 03:56:27
mmm free bits
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:29:59
As more people work for companies that pay in bitcoin, this issue will become mute.  It's the chicken and the egg problem.
You're argument is the same as someone back in 1995 saying what is the point of sending someone an email when everyone has to use a fax machine to put in their order for their computer.
@_date: 2016-07-01 02:52:38
I manage a decent sized team and a multi million dollar budget, travel often (outside of the basement I don't have), and have plenty of really great friends.  I would be careful to make false assumptions about people so quickly.  It seems making false assumptions about things is your forte though :D
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:55:19
You guys are funny.  He just believes Bitcoin will be like ACH, a means of transer.  Seriously, never met a bunch of angrier nerds than on r/bitcoin.  Maybe he's wrong but who cares, he did more for bitcoin than any of you, he started a godamn business on it.  Show some respect.

Wheat and oil are not re-usable.  So decreasing mined coins by 50% is not the same is decreasing oil or wheat production.  It will have an effect but not the same.

"The transaction volume for bitcoin is predicted to more than triple this year"
This is impossible unless we get segwit hitting on all cylinders or something.

Bardzo dobsze
@_date: 2016-07-31 02:49:26
holy hell, transaction fees are around 19 cents at the moment.  I bet it spiked fast which makes it hard even with guestimate fee solutions.
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:11:39
maybe because of both xD
@_date: 2016-07-04 02:33:57
And working on wallets that more accurately predict miner fees for prioritization of transactions 
@_date: 2016-07-08 10:34:45
Ok increase for other reasons then like preventing a massive tx backlog after halvening if miners drop off.  We are more prone to this event otherwise. 
Or increase to keep fees lower for longer to promote any usage of btc possible because it is still in its infancy. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 03:38:08
It was a perfect storm back then, with gox and all. Figure a good chunk was due to that.

I understand why you think most don't know about Bitcoin but that's actually not true. I do have some perspective here that you may not have though.  I'd rather not share reasons why but just know that I am actually fairly knowledgeable in the space.  
Couldn't tell you how many people come to me now asking about btc and how to invest in it when a year or two ago I was screaming off the top of my lungs saying they need to look at btc and was mostly ignored.  Very few are suits or nerds might I add. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 02:29:24
If we all retire at the same time and try selling our bitcoin it won't be worth much. It needs to be more than an investment like something to used to buy goods with and for innovations in M2M and IoT. Then when the price spikes and we all retire, it will only be a sell off of a small portion of what btc is mostly used for and not cause a mass crash. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:08:37
I think was talking in a broader terms, with everything you do, how does working for a for-profit built on top of bitcoin core impact your decision-making for core?  
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:56:53
just make sure you add the right amount of fees if you start to use bitcoin instead, otherwise you could wait days here as well, only to have to start over again.  It's not as bad as WU for sure though, but until we get some technical fixes it will be interesting
@_date: 2016-07-04 19:14:17
anyone else here concerned that bitcoin is no longer looked at as a currency but a settlements network?  We are starting to see some merchants shift to reflect this.  
I'd like to keep it as an affordable currency with predictable fees that both a sender and receiver can rely on, now not some months or years down the road.  Any options on the table to do so?
@_date: 2016-07-07 16:40:55
this is overrated and hasn't come to fruition.  99% of btc buying is by nerds and their friends in anticipation of the halving for now.  Coin news article authors love to spin it that the markets have matured but that just isn't the case.  Near term dip followed by a nice steady rise in price is what I think will happen.
@_date: 2016-07-21 21:43:51
Spin

"these guys"
Using blanketing speech again my friend :)
All of r/btc didn't think Craig is Satoshi. I actually see you post there quite often, so did you believe Craig is Satoshi too? :D
Seriously though, stay focused on the topic at hand rather than arguing a point by insulting a large group of people of which you are actively in yourself. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:11:26
in 1 to 2 years that 1 BTC will be LITERALLY worth 10k, there's some perspective for you.

When you say Bitcoin grew the fastest, what are you referring to? Market cap, transaction volume, miner fees? I'm just pointing out you are making a statement without specifics. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:51:21
will this maybe cause like a BTCC, sorta like ETC to ETH?

@_date: 2017-06-02 14:12:22
don't most of you just convert to ETH or LTC in an exchange before transacting on a public chain these days?  $2.50 for waiting potentially hours is not really necessary when you have other options.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:16:10
Oh really?  Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:38:47
Ah makes sense.  I actually just put in about 5 grand at about 800usd coversion so I've lost substantially if I were to sell today.  I'm not planning on ever selling them though, plan to use to buy stuff, save, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:08:09
Really I'm not sure why that would be... I mean, the price of bitcoins is still up a huge amount from a year ago.  In stocks, if you make even more than 11% that is considered a great year.
