I thought of this, and it feels like a good idea at first, but if the buyer is really interested in scamming you out of BTC, they could just claim to Paypal that the paper wallet contained no BTC and/or was a different wallet that was displayed on the Ebay ad.

Unfortunately, Casascius' website appears to be down. I was thinking of buying one.

That, and most non-government "solutions" against global warming tend to boil down to "give me money and I'll give you peace of mind." Suchas buying carbon offsets.
And if you don't buy your share of carbon offsets, you're a horrible, awful person who's killing the planet and you should be ashamed. 
I'm all for greener energy and more efficient technology, but you have to admit that 'climate change' (or 'global warming' depending on who you're talking to) has become a very convenient catch-all phrase for big names looking to make a quick buck off of peoples' guilt.

They do, but you can simply swipe a card as credit in a lot of places and it gets accepted anyway. Sometimes if I forget my PIN, the cashier says to just hit 'cancel' on the PIN entry and it processes it as if it were a credit card.
Using a debit card online is exactly like using a credit card online, too. You don't need to know the PIN to use a debit card online. 
Yeah, I wouldn't consider it any more secure than a credit card. The system that you described in the other comment makes sense to me (the card reader). It's an extra step, but it's not a convoluted one and it makes use of the PIN on the debit card.

Where I live, you do need to register for a business license even as a sole proprietorship. Laws differ from place to place.

And/or anger. It's meant to represent a blood vessel. i.e., their blood pressure has gone up due to annoyance/anger.

This doesn't come off as a cryptocurrency to me. Seems more like Microsoft Points. Especially since it can only be used on app-based purchases.

Thanks for your suggestions.
I ran the commands listed for Bitcoin-qt, and ran some searches on blockchain.info, (addresses, transaction IDs) finding none of the addresses in the transaction history have ever been listed in a block before, and that the transaction IDs don't appear to have been entered into a block, either.
My block chain files for bitcoin-qt are up to date, so I know it's not a case of just having to update that.
At this point, I'm fairly certain something got glitched somewhere, and my client is just showing broken transactions (does that happen?) I'm keeping a backup of it just in case, but I'm not going to get my hopes up.

Of course. The self-destruct sequence is -always- triggered by the final boss's death.

According to that thread, nobody was downgraded, and they're currently dealing with a weird shipping calculator with the e-shop software they use, and are intending to fix it.

So that when the recipient of the gift card/paper wallet gets home, they can open it up and scan the QR code for the private key and move the funds into one of their wallets.

Actual experience in attempting to freelance web design:
"Okay, I did everything exactly the way you said to in your original email. How's it look?"
"Looks great!" Final payment processed. Job's done.
One week later
"This looks nothing like I wanted it to. I said to use the color on the pamphlet I gave you. This is a darker shade of brown, and this yellow is off. Redo it from the ground up." Add some insults like 'I shouldn't have even hired you' in there somewhere. Expects this to be done for free.

I don't remember clearly, unfortunately. And I don't remember ever having in my possession 300+ bitcoins at any one time. I seem to remember not being able to make enough off of the bitcoins after a drop in price to cover the electricity cost, and so I shut down my mining rig and tried to maximize gains. I didn't even remember keeping a backup of my wallet file until just yesterday.
I did shut my client down for a long time afterward, though. And after a reformat at one point, I didn't even have it installed for a long time. When I reinstalled it, I had to redownload the entire block chain.

My credit card is just printed, issued by my local credit union.
