Legit, I use it all the time
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:54:32
confirmed, I tried it before, the only low cost that actually worked it toxigon.com with great customer service and I seen many nice reviews, but my txid is not worth spending $5 on it its a $6 TX.
Don't know about their free service tho, tried it and my tx got confirmed next day, could be it or could be the network my fees was 10 satoshi lol, anyway my tx is confirmed now so thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:36:14
ok can you help me than it's stuck for 2 days
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:32:14
nope, I paid and it was confirmed in less than 3 hours, I guess it needed that last push because my fees was already regular, been waiting for 4 days, they are fast. I am really tired of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:36:36
just trying to help out, site is awesome worked fine for me on the paid version, no idea about the free one or how long it takes tho but I guess its crowdy af, and sure I was afk for a long time, many things have changed. bitcoin now SUCKS! I remember when no one in my school knew what I am talking about :(

Yep but for me it doesn't matter I have invested around $1 and got it back with interest in 10 days with 100% reinvestment, than I invested back $1 for 6 months and was like lets see how much it's gonna last, to figure out it started not paying right now, anyway I am not worried for losing $1 I still have made profit before they expose but I am worried about other poor people who invested more!

no it's a process of laundry, all addresses are new and created to hold small amounts in and out.
@_date: 2015-06-12 04:26:21
I would like much to say that I was ripped off and was mistaken, they gained my trust but now they are not paying off anymore!
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:41:57

Once you register you can change that password, this site saves passwords as MD5, when you request a new password you wont get the plain text but will get a link to change it!, first time registration is the only thing sent as plain text but is also sent over SSL though Gmail not the site it self.
However never use your same password all over the place!

I see, blockchain is back  now, still got dust on my wallet as well.
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:36:52
Don't forget to go back to the main page after registration so you can claim free BTC.
