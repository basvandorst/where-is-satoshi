Don't do that. In 10-15years bitcoin reward will become insignifiant and alot of it's hashrate will drop, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Unfortunately the community and developing teams can't agree on anything, so i doubt much will change.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:52:56
It's all about power, scaling is just an excuse. 2 developer groups who are also mining cartels want to control bitcoin's destiny.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:37:57
Because several reasons:
1. Bitcoin is slow. Much slower than the altcoins.
2. It has several times lower capacity than altcoins, and thanks to it's volume there are transactions that take hours with 1-3$ fee, which is extremely expensive. Which means altcoins would run just fine even with double of curent bitcoin volume, altough they wouldn't be enough for mass adoption. 
3.It doesn't have any technological features other projects have.

They didn't sign the letter because they've seen it as wrong. You can't assign bitcoin's development to a single entity as the chosen one (dev team). That would be seem as centralization. Especially since the original bitcoin team is nowhere to be found.
For example, if ethereum foundation decides to dissapear, then any team that wants to step up and develop would have to be chose by the community, not taking the project over as if it were their own.

And how does this help ?! BTU won't divorce unless they gain enough support to be considered the main chain, which means the internal civil war will continue. So back to square 1.

Oh really Father Satoshi left the 10 commandments and we are supposed to follow through as if they hold the universal truth ?

People aren't moving much money out of bitcoin. It's just that ethereum attracts new money to the public blockchain projects.
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:28:05
Want the truth ? Ofcourse there's something to worry about if you're a btc holder. There's no argument to be made pro BTC in this situation, because it stagnates for years now and a cash peer to peer protocol, as it was defined, doesn't work because of the 1mb limit and no consensus about how to further develop. 
If, by the end of this summer there won't be a clear path forward, i think BTC will be replaced. 
And bitcoin can't survive as second best crypto project because, if value goes down and so will the mining power ( profits decrease ) it's bad because the protocol cannot adjust the difficulty enough, therefore miners will have to mine at a huge loss. If they do stop mining, then the spiral will cause it's death.

Ofcourse not. Just be ready with bags. And when you eventually leave, close the door behind you and turn off the lights.

Your understanding of "premine" is flawed. Distributing most coins is basically the same as mining, people with more money get the bigger chunks anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:36:47
Agreed ! 24k nodes vs 7k nodes
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:35:37
Meritocracy of having a cheaper electricity or simply not paying for it at all because corruption. 
In the end, both pos and pow require money, to either buy or mine tokens.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:57:37
It does require constant progression if you want it to reach mainstream and price to further increase. First logical thing to do is to increase the block size to 2-4MB ( because the limit shouldn't be there in the first place ) and then segwit+LN. But since neither party does compromise, the price is stalling.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:00:29
Being husband &amp; wife is also not good for business. They will always put eachother above other devs and the project itself. Plus onchain governance sucks, 2-3 people ( holders ) TOPs will decide it's way forward, also because of voting apathy.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:08:25
Actually you can compete with gpu mining algorithms. I am a small miner myself, and i mine with 3 gpus. I wouldn't be able to do the same with asics because their price is inflated, 10 times more expensive than gpus.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:08:27
Ethereum is the most secure chain for 1-2 weeks now, by hashrate.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:11:23
Do you really see yourself or any random users that are not businesses opening LN channels for payment ? That will be too expensive.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:27:38
They should. Problem is, the reward will be small because of the neverending halving of the reward, which mean the security will decrease. Bitcoin will have to explode in price to survive with a decent security.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:14:25
Not good enough. Even if what you say will happen ( which i doubt ), then btc still needs to scale onchain to collect fees because in 10-15years when btc reward will be close to 0, miners will want to mine fees.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:00:17
Yes as i know, but the biggest problem it is that is trusted and not trustless, and will never be able to do what a platform build from scratch for the task does.

He and his brother have the best punchable faces i've ever seen. Along with bobby lee of btcc.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:50:49
And you are wrong to do so. Because, in pow only systems, investors and miners interests won't collide. Look at bitcoin; users want LN because that would scale it, therefore it would boost the price.
But miners want bigger blocks because they want fees. And because it would sustain them for years. At this rate, bitcoin cannot survive more than 10 years because the reward will decrease and without alot of fees ( with most transactions offchain with LN ) mining won't be profitable.
And because both sides want different things, bitcoin can't move forward for years now.
In POS systems every "miner" is also an investor.
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:19:23
Isn't that a bit too slow ? You can't get a signifiant amount if you want to speculate on.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:52:09
Why wouldn't it be ? IF 10% of all ether gets staked, then a guy with 100eth will get 1eth per year, and a guy with 10.000 eth will get 100eth per year.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:11:47
Only those who invested alot in btc will build dapps for it, otherwise it isn't a really good choice. Without it's own token, dapps cannot be incentivised. Also it requires a trusted setup and it won't be as efficient without a platform build to satisfy all the needs of a dapp platform, and a PoW system is really a poor choice itself.
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:06:15
What a load of bullshit. 1MB is horrible and 2MB-4MB would help, altough it wouldn't be a long term solution without LN for mass scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:22:48
What ? You are completely wrong. Pos is actually better than POW because users are also potential miners. In POW, users and miners interests are not aligned, therefore bitcoin atm cannot scale.
And you don't need alot of capital to become a miner, therefore POS is more open than POW to more users, that equals better decentralization.
I do not understand this part "avoid the issue of paying people to hold your currency with money from thin air"
It's basically mining without having to run specialised hardware, just a regular pc / laptop instead.
And this part "Is it fair to pay the rich more than the poor for holding the money?" ; it's also wrong. You seem to believe that in POS a guy with 1token staked should be paid as much as a guy locking 10.000. Doesn't work, nowhere. Is it fair to pay the mining farm, a guy who invested 10mil$ in it more than a guy who mines with 1 asic ?!
Keep in mind, although in some primitive POS systems you just "hold" tokens, like in dash's masternodes, some are more advanced and there's also risks that come with it, and the fact that you lock it for periods. Basically when you stake in eth you assume some responsabilities.
Bitcoin would do so much better with a good POS systems put in place, but miners will never agree. Neither the devs, because bitcoin's mining praised for so many years, would be awkward to change their minds now.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:39:07
But what is your point ? What does ethical means for you in this case ?
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:06:32
Asics are a problem, because only manufacturers and their business partners afford to buy them at a decent price. Random joes that would be able to mine with a 200$ gpu and a ROI of 3 months would have to pay 2k with a ROI of more than a year, which kicks out all the small and average miners. 
I wanted to buy asics too, but rather invested 10 times less on GPU's with better profit margin for ethereum, as a small miner.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:02:41
Yes, worst case scenario is: assume 10% of eth staked, meaning 2billion dollars. To attack, you need 1bil+ 1$. If there are many potential attackers, they can't risk attacking it because they don't know if the others would do the same. Assuming 4 potential attackers with 250mil each, if only 1-2-3 of them attack, they get slashed and lose everything.
Worst case scenario is a single entity willing to attack and lose 1 billion dollar ( with 10% staked ) and do a 51% by itself. In that case i think a HF would be required, attacker stake removed. But that's very unlikely, attackers won't bother investing ~30-100mil in mining for a 51%, doubt they would waste billions in POS.

No, banks do not buy nor use XRP. It's written on ripple's site that xrp is not needed to use the ripple's network. Ripple just hoped xrp would become a middle currency between other currencies, but that would be impossible without a stable currency.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:22:10
Then tell me, smart guy, why is it stupid ? To maintain dapps, someone has to pay for their maintenance. And will be either users or the devs who will pay for them, pro bono. There is a reason blockchains need their own tokens, and that is to monetise the work and create an incentive to do anything.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:44:16
They do, not all of them ofcourse, but many do ! It's so much harder to monetise the dapp without a native token. Ofcourse every eth holder dreams of dapps without native token and all of them to use eth instead, that would increase the price. But it's not happening.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:45:49
Ofcourse not. I haven't read much about it, but you'd have to lock up eth and stake for 4 months. You can also log off, but still you have to stay majority of the time online, to not get your stake slashed. Like, if you stake but then you go offline for 4 months, then your stake gets slahed. This is to avoid attacks, or atleast make it extremely expensive.
@_date: 2017-05-01 11:57:07
Sidechains are talked about for 3 years now, won't happen. Also rootstock tries to implement smart contracts, but it will require a trusted setup to make it work.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:21:44
Nobody sane will switch because rootstock is not trustless. It requires a trusted party. Not to mention it's not something build from ground up for dapps / contracts, so will have big limitations.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:01:29
~10% for 1 year. Then 1% with POS / 1mil each year.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:02:28
1% inflation rate with pos in 1 year. Meaning, in 2018 there'll be about 100mil tokens, and 1 more mil will be added each year. But there are also burned / lost tokens so that 1% barely makes up for those.
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:18:49
Exactly. Miners know LN is against their interests and they are invested long term, that's why they oppose.
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:36:45
Plus, LN doesn't really help with congestion because most transactions wouldn't open a channel. I think atleast a 2mb+ln would be ideal compromise untill bitcoin can copy ethereum's sharding in ~2 years.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:11:02
If you go with that logic, then bitcoin doesn't have a cap either. Because it would need like 150 years to get to 21mil tokens, world might end by then.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:11:53
A simpler version of casper is almost done. Ofcourse miners will resist but they aren't needed in POS.
P.S: you seem to be getting desperate. Stress seems to be killing you, saw your twitter rant.
