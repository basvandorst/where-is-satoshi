The price of energy today for a mined bitcoin is from 3k to 5k usd. Which means that even if had the halving today the hashrate would not budge much.
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:35:36
Not necessarily. For example today we have 70E hashrate. How do you know if this is too little, just enough or too much for securing the chain? You don't. 
But let's assume that in 2028 the cost is 32k and only those that have 0.01 usd/kW can mine Bitcoin. That means that the hashrate is 20E let's assume. Yes that is less security for each individual block, but if you wait at least 4 blocks you will have more security than you have today after 1 block. In other words you will wait more time to have the same security.

I believe this type of reaction is healthy and it only tries to keep people honest. The reality is the foundation gathered so many people in order to attract easier the donations. And even if the intentions are good, the repercussion COULD (doesn't mean they will) spell disaster.

Can we have the exchanges disclose what version their nodes run on? This would help the people that don't run their full node. But this incident is precisely why people SHOULD run their own nodes!
@_date: 2018-09-26 07:27:47
the  argument was that if you had the 2nd part of the seed, including the checksum, it would have been easier to brute force because the checksum word narrows down the words needed. Can't validate this is true
@_date: 2018-09-25 14:32:09
Yes I mean seed. As I broke my 24 words in 2 pieces, and deleted first word on the first sheet and last word (the checksum word) on the 2nd sheet. Those 2 words I remembered them. So I wanted to know if this is safe as many people said it's worse to split the 24 words. But without the checksum word, I believed it should be pretty hard as well if the 2nd sheet is accidentally found by someone.

@_date: 2019-11-05 14:24:02
Yes, you would use your full node to validate the coins on your wallet. This system was created in order you to get your sovereignty back and not have to trust anyone. I recommend getting a RPi4 and downloading [ software. It's just copying the image on an sdcard and you get a full bitcoin node, Electrum Server, and lightning. From there you just point Electrum wallet to your full node and you're set.
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:52:09
It's a 2nd layer on Bitcoin proposal.
@_date: 2019-11-24 18:55:19
A full node is a software that downloads from other peers all the transactions from the genesis block (1st block created by Satoshi) and verifies if all proof of work has been done for each new block. You can then use a full node to verify the coins you received that they appear in the blockchain history and that they have not been spent. In other words you verify they are valid. Your full node is like a fake coin checker. All this is done by the software but by doing this you also enforce the Bitcoin rules and support the decentralization of the network.

You must have a lot of coins if you were around here back then.
@_date: 2019-11-13 14:19:01
More important is to understand WHY you want to run a full node and validate your keys.  
Bitcoin is a system that gives back sovereignty. You want to make sure you have those coins without having to trust ANY third party.
By holding the private keys yourself with a hardware wallet (I recommend the ColdCard) and validating the keys with a personal full node (I recommend [ and a Raspberry Pi 4) you have complete power over your coins and nobody can cheat you.

This is offtopic but relates to the utxo set. What do you think about this:  
@_date: 2019-11-24 19:29:46
By running a node you are becoming a sovereign individual. You don't need to trust anyone to tell you if you really own Bitcoins. Today you have to go to a bank to ask if you received your money, and you trust the bank that it will give it back to you.
In order to run a full node you can use an old computer or buy a Raspberry pi 4 and an external HDD. There are many tutorials on youtube.But you would also need to hold  your own bitcoins on your own wallet (preferably a hardware wallet) and not on an exchange. Again, there are many youtube tutorials that explain the differences between Bitcoin wallets.
If you have any other question don't hesitate to ask!

Is there a safe medium that we trust where we can deploy signed transaction? Something like blockstream explorer that we'd know for certain would refuse the transaction that does not follow standard format?
@_date: 2019-08-25 04:50:14
once they show up on bitcoin core they are verified. After that you can send them back to your desired wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-22 13:39:49
By my understandings MW is not really that private because a custom node can just track al MW transactions and index them into a blockchain type of data base. So we would be back to square one.
@_date: 2019-10-23 07:58:34
My main concerns are:
1. Can extension blocks create forks?
2. Can miners attack somehow the network (remember I read this somewhere)
3. Can one go in and out of the extension block or is it just one way?
4. Can full nodes verify the supply limit? I'd imagine if there was inflation inside the extension block full nodes would not see it?
5. What is the impact on full nodes? Are they forced to download extension blocks as well?
@_date: 2019-08-25 04:48:15
@_date: 2019-10-14 21:27:33
The coins have moved on the ledger (on-chain) and each full node will register that transaction. Your hardware wallet has inside of it a secret key that can be used to spend the coins that were transfered on-chain. So you and everyone can see the coins that have moved, but nobody can spend them but you by using the hardware wallet. So again: there are no coins on the hardware wallet, just the secret key that is used to sign a new transaction. If you have any more questions feel free to ask.

So did satoshilabs confirm there was a firmware update recently? Can you verify your firmware you have atm on the device if it matches the latest on trezor website?

Don't just run a full node, but actually USE it to validate your own transactions. This is the only way to know you own coins. Do no trust the software that comes with your hardware wallet.
It's not enough to run a node, but you also have to run an electrum server that indexes all the data in easy to read for Electrum wallet.
I personally use [ node which has an image file made specifically for Raspberry Pi 4 which is very easy to use and install, and has out of the box the Core, Electrum Server, Lightning Network and other things. It's the easiest setup I found to verify your UTXOs.

Adam I have 2 questions:  
1. Aren't you afraid that EB potential inflation would dilute on-chain coins because they would be priced equally? Everyone would have to exit to verify inflation something that would not happen.
2. Isn't a concern the higher minimum requirements for running a fully validating node that would have to verify EBs as well?
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:19:05
1) If this soft fork does not get consensus from all miners what happens? Do extension blocks create anyone-can-spend utxos?   
2) If miners change rules of EBs can my node enforce the rules somehow? Exclude Eblocks that are not valid?  
3) If there ever was inflation everyone should quit EBs in order to make sure right? So if that doesn't happen we could have a permanent inflation. If EB coins have same value like on-chain coins that means they get dilluted unless inflation is proved, right?
@_date: 2019-10-22 14:11:41
Correct. Yet extension blocks have an inherrent risk if I remember  correctly to split the network. So is adding a functionality that can be achieved with second layer worth the risk? Don't get me going with talking about full nodes impact.
@_date: 2019-12-06 11:21:08
I am not arguing against CT! But I still would like to debate:  
Let's imagine a world where we had mimble wimble or another type of confidential transactions on-chain and/or extension blocks from day one. And during the 11 years we have one overflow bug and one CVE-2018-17144 inflation bug.  
Does Bitcoin recover from those bugs and people still trust it wholeheartedly like today?
@_date: 2019-12-27 12:28:39
If you know for sure your backup was not compromised and you never typed it in an email or took a picture of it with a phone... you can always use those 24 words. I never change the words when I switch the device. Just make sure nobody had access to them and you didn't store them digitally.  
Safest way if you are very very paranoid is to use a Coldcard wallet. This hardware wallet doesn't even connect to the computer like the Ledger S, and you create transactions and move them to the device for signing via SD-card.
@_date: 2019-12-05 09:04:07
If you had to chose, would you convert current utxo model to MW model?

" A bitcoin full node is like the necklace that everybody else sees. Is  the string that holds the money for us in place. It’s our projection to  the world for what we believe money is. "  
@_date: 2019-12-27 11:40:59
If you reset the 24 words stored in the Ledger are wiped.   
You can create a new wallet that will give you 24 new words and balance zero,
Or you can use the 24 words from the backup and have the old wallet.  
A bit more technical: The 24 words is the representation of the private key. This private key is used to sign a transaction for the bitcoins that have been sent to the public keys generated by the private key. So the bitcoins realistically are in the blockchain (on everyone's computers, something like the cloud), but the private key is the only thing that can let you or anyone spend those coins. That's why if someone finds your backup he can spend your coins from another wallet.

No you don't need to generate a new seed phrase. The seed phrase you have can be used to recreate your wallet on any device or software, not only on Ledger. So it's best to back up that seed phrase and not lose it!

Bitcoin was created to be decentralized.  This is the most important quality it has and if it's lost, Bitcoin is a failed Project. In order for bitcoin to stay decentralized you need every change that it's being made to be agreed upon by the users and be benefiting ONLY the users. If there is a party that can change bitcoin against the will of the users means Bitcoin has failed. The security of Bitcoin is made in a economical way by this process: Whenever a user demands bitcoin, he will demand that the bitcoin he receives checks out the user's full node. This way the user can make sure that the rules of bitcoin are the one of his implementation and this way the security is in place.   
If there is a small group of people that can volunterely modify the implementation that is not Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is secured by all the users validating the rules using their own full nodes.
