There are existing avenues for justice to be served, regardless of the currency stolen or the mechanism by which it was taken.
We don't try to fix cash after someone pulls off a bank heist - we go after the perpetrators, try them in court, and if guilty, we make them return the money and serve time in prison.  Cryptocurrencies should be treated like cash, not as a system that can be modified and have historical records modified to enact "justice".  
Precedent here is dangerous, what happens when donations to wikileaks get blocked or reversed, or when darknet market sellers see their bitcoin turned in to a wallet possessed by the DEA in an act of "justice"?  Immutability is perhaps the best selling point of bitcoin over traditional institutional transactions - and changing that can't be taken lightly.

If they are indeed pre-mining, it is indeed a scam.  It becomes the equivalent of me selling you used gear and claiming that it's new, as well as me profiting from another persons product (assuming they paid for it) by intentionally delaying shipping.

1.  You scan a QR code of your bitcoin address - this can be a paper wallet, your phone, whatever. 
2.  You insert dollar bills.  It accepts $1s, too.  
3.  Once you are satisfied with the dollar amount, you hit "Purchase" and then confirm.  
4.  The bitcoin are then sent to your wallet.  
I bought $20 worth of bitcoin and recieved about $19.05 (note:  my wallet app and the machine could be using different exchange rates).  Seems pretty cool to me!

Making devices that let us travel across the country in a matter of hours.

The benefits are not extremely exaggerated at all - the risks however certainly are.  
Just to give you an idea of how bad it was in the past, a "flu epidemic" used to cause anywhere from a million to a hundred million deaths and popped up every few decades.  Now, an "epidemic" kills just a few thousand people.  This is largely due to vaccines causing "herd immunity" - when the majority of people are vaccinated and immune, disease transmission drops significantly to the point where we eradicated it.  
Prior to the widespread use of vaccines, diseases like polio, mumps, rubella, measles, and the like were extremely common - orders of magnitude more common than even mild vaccine side effects that we see today.  If you want to be the douche that refuses to get vaccinated (or even worse, refuses to get your children vaccinated), so be it, I'm not going to force you.  But just know that by not vaccinating yourself, you are putting others (specifically those who cannot be vaccinated due to illness, allergies, or other factors) at increased risk for life-threatening diseases.

Want a more realistic scenario than coinbase being hacked or turning out to be a Ponzi scheme that collapses?
Bitcoin losing 50% of its value in the span of days.  
Buying, trading and holding bitcoin or any other volatile investment is a risky venture in and of itself.  People are willing to take that risk, just like they're willing to take the risk that coinbase folds, or the risk that the US government imposes further restrictions on bitcoin that cause the value to tank.  
If you aren't prepared for risk, don't buy bitcoin - I hear Vanguard mutual funds are a safe bet.  If you're willing to accept some risk, buy some bitcoin and take them out of coinbase immediately.  If you've got plenty of financial security as it is, leave your coins on coinbase if you want, you'll still be fine in the worst case scenario.
A strict enough regulation can become a de-facto ban by making the market hostile and unprofitable.  If you don't like Coinbase's policy and don't want to do business with them, that's fine - but don't make it so that I can't.

It wouldn’t actually require the coin to directly support it - you can generate transactions entirely offline (sign them with your private key) and hand them off to as many people as you want until someone with internet access pushes it to the network.
This approach requires the receiving party to trust that your transaction is valid / that the hand-off system works / that you won’t double-spend your coins, but for some peer-to-peer scenarios where relationships are strong, this is totally acceptable.

This is not a fault of bitcoin, this is a fault of the user.  There are ways for a user to protect themselves from this, and in the future, there will be easy ways for users to protect themselves from this.  
First and foremost:  don't keep all your eggs in one basket.  Large sums of money stay in offline storage.  If you've got TONS of cash, split your private keys up over different safe deposit boxes / safes, etc.  
Secondly:  2-factor auth and wallets for different uses - maybe you've got a "day to day" wallet that gets auto-reloaded up to $75 every day to cover food, travel, etc.  And a "shopping" wallet that you fill with $500 worth when you're planning on going out.  
@_date: 2015-03-04 04:58:41
I think the most important thing to note is that it's not ready... Yet. 
Yeah, there are plenty of flaws with the current system, but they aren't flaws with the underlying protocol, on the "stuff" that sits on top of it.  Over time, I have little doubt that it can't get to the point where your average person can use it - for example, a provably secure biometric hardware wallet built into a smartphone.
@_date: 2015-03-04 07:26:20
Once you isolate hardware from any sort of networking, and insure that the hardware memory cannot be read by an external device connected to it (believe it or not, this is trivial in embedded systems), it's easy to toss on a final (and imperfect) layer of security like a PIN or biometric (fingerprint, iris scan, etc) to make it virtually unbeatable.  The only valid attack vector in these cases would be opening the device and attempting to read the flash, but even that could be prevented with volatile memory and a "dead mans switch" of sorts.  Potted ICs, ASICs with custom-designed access prevention and obfuscation drive this further into impossibility.  
All that said, at the end of the day, what matters is that the protocol itself works.  Users who know their stuff and are comfortable with security can use it raw.  Users who do not can utilize bank-like entities to store and insure their money just like existing banks, credit cards, etc, but will obviously face the same set of downsides that we see with the current system.  Assuming the price stabilizes to the same or greater degree than the dollar (for the sake of argument), there is no reason why bitcoin wouldn't be a more-optimal choice than USD.  
@_date: 2016-07-24 19:54:27

Someone is effectively "borrowing" BTC now with a contract to pay them back later.  They are betting on the bitcoin price to fall, so they can buy the bitcoin at a lower price later, give it back, and pocket the profit.  
If they are wrong and bitcoin goes up, they get "squeezed" when they have to cover their positions and sell back the bitcoin for a loss.

I'm pretty sure the cause this time is someone shorting big time to tank the price temporarily, make some large OTA buys before the halvening, and then sell afterwards.

@_date: 2016-07-25 00:43:21
Could be, but it's not "the point".  The point is that in the US, the serial number is located on the lower receiver, making it legally "the gun" and the only part that has any restrictions on its sale.  If your goal is a reliable, functional gun (semi auto or full auto), just print or machine a lower yourself, and you're in business.

Fair point -- I didn't even realize they made a unit that could go fast, I assumed the H was just a flag for the package or revision.  I've only ever worked with the R / RL models.  
That said, it would make much more sense if they had it hooked up to an ARM CPU, the ASIC's, or the FPGA.  Passing data through that MCU (which is only a 66Mhz unit) to / from the ASIC's or FPGA is going to bottleneck you down to the point where that speed isn't significant at all, and the Full-Speed USB would likely be more than enough.  The fastest rated bandwidth for any of the major IO units on that is 100Mbits, and passing through data (decoding from USART and then encoding back to use with synchronous FIFO for the 232) is going to limit you to well below that.  
@_date: 2013-06-20 01:02:14
Haha, I've traveled to a few similar facilities (inside the US).  Pretty lax -- workers in plain clothes, only wearing cleanroom getups if they are working with bare IC's (relatively infrequent), no security at all, just a front door and front desk.  Boards that fail QA get quickly spot checked under a magnifying lamp, and only fully scoped and tested if the company pays big bucks or is doing a small pre-production run.  If they can't be fixed in 5 minutes, they just get dumped into a rejects bin, which in turn is emptied into an e-waste or hazardous materials dumpster at the end of the day.
Would be pretty easy to just grab a few after they've gone in, tuck them in your lunchbox, and walk out at the end of the day.  Sure, if you got caught you'd probably be punished, but it honestly wouldn't look that odd and your chances of actually getting caught are super slim, unlike eating a burger in a kitchen where nobody is allowed to eat.

@_date: 2013-11-01 01:51:47
Well, presumably there are two latencies acting here.  The network takes anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours to verify transactions, depending on load, miners and the fee you paid.  Sometimes it might be slower than this, but not too often.  Then you've got latency on their server end, which could be anywhere from 3 seconds to hours.  They have to actually initiate the transfer on their end, and if they are having server troubles, it could be abnormally long.  
Ideally you should see the transfer happen in a matter of seconds / minutes, but in order to prevent double spending, the bitcoins won't be spendable until it is confirmed, which takes some time.
@_date: 2013-03-12 23:54:37
Okay, I'm an electrical engineer in the hardware side of the embedded systems industry.  Allow me to do some analysis of their work.  
First off, they've got an Atmel 32UC3 MCU on there, which is a beast of an MCU.  It's got onboard, native USB compatibility and a bunch of other awesome features.  But right next to it, between it and the USB port, they've got a FT232, which is a UART to USB conversion box.  The fuck?  Really, guys?  You've got onboard USB, but you add another step in the way, that requires an extra driver on the client side, increases board complexity and adds cost?  Really?  Thats just sloppy and lazy.  
On top of that, they've got yet ANOTHER Atmel IC (on the non barrel jack version, I suppose), again with USB.  This time, however, they don't use another FT232.  I don't understand why, if they are going to use a 232 anyways, they didn't just suck the onboard USB from the 32UC3 to connect to that jack and then the FT232 for the other.  Idiots.  
On top of that, they've got an FPGA and a (currently) unpopulated slot of an ARM processor.  Again, really guys?  You are making ASIC's, stop cheaping out and add whatever else you need right on the dies.  The ARM CPU makes sense (sometimes), the FPGA doesn't.  This looks to me like they forgot some features on the ASIC's and didn't realize till they were far into production, and they had to compensate by changing the board and adding an FPGA.  
Don't trust BFL with your money.  It looks to me like they have no clue what the are doing.

Generally I'd tend to agree with you, but board space is clearly a precious commodity here.  The space and money that went into those parts could have been used for better power regulation circuits or even extra mining ASICs, which clearly would have been preferable.
Lets also remember that this is a commercial good, not and in-house development / debugging platform.  That is where you toss every IC and connector imaginable on the board so you can figure out exactly what you need (and dont need)  for the final version.

Typically it just produces really nice looking, easy to use applications.  Basically anything you download off the iOS or Mac App Store is going to look gorgeous and work pretty well.  You'll also pay an arm and a leg, be locked-down by Apples restrictions, and will likely always be a little behind the cutting edge.  
I'm a linux user with an iPhone, and I can say that I actually enjoy both open-source and "walled garden" approaches - they both have their own advantages and disadvantages.

There are many problems with the NAP, but its the best thing we have.  It allows the ultimate in individual liberty (do whatever the fuck you want as long as it doesn't harm me) while still preventing things like theft, murder, violence, rape, etc.  In my opinion, its a better moral framework than anything any government has ever instituted, mainly because it allows individuals to have their own morals without forcing them on others.  
As for your first comment, yes, this is true.  That is why I'm a believer in voluntarism -- I just think it will never be achieved in the near future, and therefore stepping to capital-L Libertarianism and then libertarian  minarchism is the best path in the right direction that we have.

It is pretty much impossible to grab the sort of data he needed to get into your encrypted drive over the network, even if you recycled the PW.  I'm guessing he waited till you logged in and left the computer open, and then accessed your coins.  
I suggested you fully encrypt a USB flash drive, toss your keys in an encrypted file on that drive (with a different password), and then only open that with a linux distro you have configured to only write to RAM, and not the HDD.  That way, it will reset back to default on every reboot, making malware impossible to get you.

Exactly.  Its ridiculous - the equivalent of trying to say that a store couldn't charge you extra if you used their bags instead of bringing your own.  Most stores aren't assholes and will eat cost of the bags, which is relatively small, but capitalism is all about competition and attempting to reduce your price as low as possible -- and regulations like this limit that ability.  
I've got a feeling that in this case, the government wanted to push and expand credit card use because its easier to track than cash, and thus better for their law enforcement / domestic spying programs.

I don't know if you are being sarcastic, but Milton had pretty libertarian views and probably would have advocated for the government to be as far away as possible, or at least for the coexistence of private currencies as well.

I'm an electrical engineer.  The part you said about motherboard manufacturers not designing their own boards is false.  
CPU manufacturers and similar provide specs and reference designs that motherboard manufacturers can use -- these are typically just schematics and suggested components for things like voltage regulation.  It is then up the the board designers to figure out what features they want to include (with regards to audio, IO, BIOS, PCI, etc).  They then follow the standards of each of those organizations and the ones set by say, intel to design the schematic with the features they way.  The boards then have to be designed entirely from scratch to accommodate any and all features they added -- there is no way to jam additional chips onto a pre-laid out PCB without re-routing every single trace.  
So basically, the manufacturers do design their own boards.  They follow specifications set by a variety of other organizations and merge their schematics into one, with a lot of their own tweaks and additions, and then they route the design themselves.  There is no entire reference design, its a giant culmination they have to create based on the features they are choosing to add.   
@_date: 2013-02-05 23:08:38
Yeah, kind of odd considering everything else is populated (including fine pitch stuff -- there are 2 BGA packages and a QFN on the board already).  Also, some (I'm assuming) power regulation inductors are off.  When I've produced boards, I've never had then shipped out to me half populated and then shipped them back to get components added, especially when they can already handle the pitch.  Odd.

How about we just institute legislation holding up the NAP and call that the end for "morality"-based legislation?  If two consenting adults want to do something (doesn't matter what it is) and they aren't hurting or destroying anyone else's property or person, why should we have laws to stop them?

Kinda like how the government has no control over bitcoin?  They wouldn't give up control of their own currency, sure, but he would have advocated that private or distributed groups create their own competitive currencies based on the same ideas.
Edit: Here is a quote from a Cato institute piece of Milton and this issue:  "Friedman ultimately concluded (Friedman and Schwartz 1986: 52) that there is, after all, “no reason currently to prohibit banks or other groups from issuing hand-to-hand currency,”".

Haha, I'm not an ASIC / VLSI engineer, so I'd only be of use with regards to the process of system design, analog electronics and PCB design.  The ASIC's are definitely what has been holding them back, though - this monstrosity SHOULD still work fine, its just not very well planned.

You can always check the public key online to verify that the money is still there.  The largest risk with these is that the person making them has a big list of public and privates somewhere, and one day the list will get long enough that he'll cash in on everyone that he can, and then disappear.  However, it seems pretty unlikely to me - Casascius seems like an honest and legitimate person.

RNG's in something like a beaglebone are just as strong as what you'd find in an ARM-based phone or tablet (basically all of them), and nearly as strong as what you get with an Intel or AMD x86 / x64 CPU.  They are perfectly fine for crypto provided you are using strong algorithms on top of them.  
Small 8-16bit microcontrollers though?  Wouldn't trust generic ones to do crypto for my life, but they do sell models with strong RNG's just for this purpose, so it may be possible if you roll out a custom solution.

You are right, this is a serious issue.  There would need to be some definitions, particularly with pollutants, as to what constitutes aggression.  For example, you might say that a car releasing more than x liters of CO2 per mile is polluting, or that releasing more than y pounds of chemical z into the air/water/etc is illegal.  
This is one of the major reasons why I think Minarchism is a better solution (for many problems) than Anarcho-Capitalism, although they both have their upsides and downsides.

Humans lived in the woods without any modern products, goods, or services for tens of thousands of years.  Making money is not necessary to survive, you can live in the woods just fine.  Obviously its not the way you want to live, but it is a way to avoid the "economic coercion" you discussed.

It isn't consenting if you are forced, threatened, or otherwise under duress.  Forcing someone to do something they don't want to do would still be illegal (due to it being a violation of the NAP).  If you consent to a contract with a school, employer, landlord, etc, and the terms state that you will be kicked out / removed is you don't pay money, then that is fine -- you agreed to it.  
As for your last statement, I don't see how its relevant.  Most people wouldn't say that they want to work 9-5 jobs behind a cubicle when they get older, but they do anyways, completely legally and without society batting an eyelash.  I don't see how (consensual) prostitution is any different.
