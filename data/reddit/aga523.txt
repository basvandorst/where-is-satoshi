So is this going to be legit or another scam or Ponzi platform?

I'm not mining at home, I'm cloud mining.
Bitcoin.com promises 0.00034774 BTC per day. As long as the price stays roughly over $8500 per coin; in one year I will at least break even. With today's price I will make a reasonable profit. The base investment for the contract with today's price will barely net me the coin they promise in 1 day.
I do however want to learn how to setup my own home mining rig so I can get in on some of the altcoins.
Do you have any faucets to recommend? The one's I've found aren't worth the damn cluttered screens I never know what I'm clicking on.

I know the math. I just wonder if I'm missing a feature to do it automatically... would be so much easier to tell the app to buy $1000 worth of coin when its under a price point instead of having to do the calculation myself

I was reading that they don't pay out as promised and contracts have been changed or cancelled before ROI
I mean not as many complaints as other sites that were found to be fake and like Ponzi schemes. 
I wouldn't mind giving it a try except that they're sold out of all mining except Monero (?)

whats this?

Red light, Green light.... 1 2 3 !
Caught you! now go back to the start line and try again!
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:18:01
Lucky how? I still submitted an order.
At this point I'm wondering if i'm going to get charged for nothing, or will I actually get some mining space and see how / if I get ROI.
I'm playing Coinbase with my deposit account and riding the fluctuations on BTC and LTC

I don't see any mining options on the ORG site. Its just information looks like.

Hahaha ... Navient sounds more like a cosplay name. Still same ol' Sallie
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:17:38
I don't know. I've never gotten any response. 
I did not get any financial loss (except potential from lack of mining). I didn't use bank account I used credit card and nothing has been charged fortunately.

I'm not a nonprofit. But I am drowning in school debt. I have $200k and living paycheck to paycheck, which is absurd for someone in medicine. But Sallie Mae is a scarier woman than my ex!
I would be greatly appreciative if the philanthropist were to help pay it down for me!

Hahaha. Residency pays pitifully. Its salaried and just barely minimum wage when you calculate actual hours worked (not the reported hours so you don't go over the 80 hour / week rule). In reality most residents work 100 hours per week (in hospital); not including studying, testing, lectures, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:40:18
Not sure. The contract is a year for 2TH/s which they believe with current block chain will yield that much BTC daily

Yea if you get right specialty you can pay off in no time. I'm primary care and work for under-served area. So work is hard and money will not be great in comparison to my peers.

If cloud mining is not a good option for investing. Are there any other options outside of buying coin itself?
Was trying to look into setting up my own home mining setup. But can't filter good vs bad data.
I know for this multifactorial costs including hardware, energy, pool fees. Just seemed like cloud mining would've been easier with someone already figured this out.
