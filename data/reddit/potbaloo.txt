No that’s not the point. This is about the technical aspect of the network, not exclusively about price. If the difficulty is too high, and there is not enough hashrate, the proceeding block will be impossible to mine. It’s dubbed as the blockchain death spiral.

Good point, it hasn’t risen that much. But what if they coordinate a large portion of the network switch to bitcoin cash? If they flood the network with txs it will slow to a crawl. If they cause a price crash with a coordinated dump as well as panic sellers, other miners could potentially switch to bitcoincash, as its way more profitable. The bitcoin network could slow to a crawl, they’ve tried this in the past. I’m just warning, it looks like it’s about to happen again

The concern is the blockchain death spiral which can happen.

I’ve made purchases with bitcoin yes, I’ve been in bitcoin for a while. This is not an argument for which one is superior, I don’t ever see bitcoin as being a currency, I believe it is a store of value. That’s not the point, the point is there is obvious signs of a coordinated attack about to take place. I bet bitcoin will crash hard in one to two days. Trust me, that’s the exact opposite of what I want. Bitcoin can be harmed by them, it’s not impossible.

So I want to claim my bch using electrum/electron cash. They recommend I install electron cash on another system, but I only have one computer. Can I send my btc in electrum to Coinbase, then install electron cash, sweep the keys and get my bch?

Ok I see. Well what is replay protection doesn't take place, will my bitcoins be stuck on that wallet forever? Serious question
