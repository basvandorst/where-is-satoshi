I think that people will embrace the worlds most secure decentralized network once they understand the system they are currently under. Great figures of our past have warned us of the dangers we face and until now we have had little alternative other then have faith in our political process or revolt. This alone is looking at it on our own national level. It however is further reaching then that. It has the potential as a settlement layer for nations and can disrupt the USD reserve note status as we continue to use economic policy as an arm of our militarization and subjugation of foreign nations.
“History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and its issuance.” -James Madison
"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."  Henry Ford
“If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.” – Thomas Jefferson in the debate over the Re-charter of the Bank Bill (1809)
“I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.” –Thomas Jefferson
“I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.” -Woodrow Wilson
The real truth of the matter is,as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson… -Franklin D. Roosevelt (in a letter to Colonel House, dated November 21, 1933)
From the Bankers own mouth.
*“Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes the laws.” Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812), founder of the House of Rothschild.*
*“I am afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can and do create money. And they who control the credit of the nation direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of their hand the destiny of the people.” Reginald McKenna, as Chairman of the Midland Bank, addressing stockholders in 1924.*
*“The few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profits or be so dependent upon its favours that there will be no opposition from that class, while on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending the tremendous advantage that capital derives from the system, will bear its burdens without complaint, and perhaps without even suspecting that the system is inimical to their interests.” The Rothschild brothers of London writing to associates in New York, 1863.*
*“The bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing.” William Paterson, founder of the Bank of England in 1694, then a privately owned bank*

Stainless steel grade 2111HTR would be great if you can find it.
Remember that not all "stainless steel" is the same grade it all comes down to chromium content. I am sure most stainless steel would work great but this is more of a FYI
Stainless steels are most commonly used for their corrosion resistance. The second most common reason stainless steels are used is for their high temperature properties; stainless steels can be found in applications where high temperature oxidation resistance is necessary, and in other applications where high temperature strength is required. The high chromium content which is so beneficial to the wet corrosion resistance of stainless steels is also highly beneficial to their high temperature strength and resistance to scaling at elevated temperatures.
I prefer to use an alphabet metal punch stamp vs engraving. -mainly because my handwriting that small with an engraver is not great, and I like the clear uniformity that doing it with a metal punch can provide.

You forgot to use Coinbasepro, regular Coinbase will always overcharge you on the bid/ask spread.

You can purchase bitcoin using limit orders vs market orders and therefore you get to choose the exact price you are willing to pay.
Fees are lower on Coinbasepro as well.

**The FDIC doesn’t insure the contents of a safe deposit box, nor does the bank itself** unless otherwise stated in your agreement.   
In some cases, collection may involve **seizure** of your personal assets, including valuables and cash kept in a **safe deposit box**. Creditors don't get an easy ride, however. They'll have to get a court judgment for the debt, and they may need a second judgment authorizing them to **seize** your **safe deposit box**.

Wow congratulations,
I would do a few things to get started.
Realize you now have a mass amount of wealth at your disposal. While you may not feel like you have any new options until you can "cash out" but you can repay any creditor once you get this figured out. So in the mean time to hire a lawyer, and properly prepare yourself to take on the wealth, taking on some debt to pay for their services in the short time will not hurt you, ie if you need to put the lawyers, accountants on credit it will not really hurt you in the long run.
Learn how and where the coins are stored, accessing them will vary depending on storage methods. As a student study BTC like anything else realize that you have a lifetime of wealth at your disposal if you take your time and properly access and secure it.
IE paper wallets, hardware wallets, or sitting on an exchange all have different steps involved to "cash out" . Once you figure out where the coins are at you can do some research on how to properly access them. If they are not already on a hardware wallet like a trezor or ledger i would recommend you looking into them.
Once you have full control of your coins, IE on a wallet you have the only private keys for you can look to find an exchange that is legal in your state and sign up. They will provide you with an address to send the coins to and you can sell them on the open market, most exchanges will do ACH bank transfers or Wire transfers directly to your bank account.
Be sure to speak with your bank before sending any unusually large deposits. If they have a problem with crypto just find another bank. I personally haven't had issues with banks rejecting deposits from exchanges but I have heard of others having issues so its always best just to ask if they have any crypto/bitcoin policies before making a huge deposit.
I would personally do this by "pretending" I had not inherited anything, but you just got interested in that bitcoin stuff your crazy uncle/father talks about during the holidays. Pretend like you are new person looking to understand and invest say a few $100 in bitcoin. This will help you figure out where you can buy/sell it (ie an exchange) and get a hardware wallet setup. By doing this you will get familiar with they new systems before you try anything with your main large stash. Buy a few coins get used to transfers in and out make a few small deposits withdraws from your wallet to the exchange and then to your bank.
Many may recommend holding it all but in your case i would definitely cash some out and pay off any debts and taxes you incur and then cash out what you need as you need it.
Watch out for scammers and scams they are everywhere....
Feel free to ask questions in public vs private/direct message so that others can chime in, people are pretty good around here to call out scammers, and its harder to scam someone if front of everyone else, then it is 1 on 1.

100% no, do not let him touch your money. Do it yourself. Not only will he have control over your investment but it may be breaking a few laws. To avoid confrontation i would just ask if he has his Money transmission licence and if so ask for the approval of his custodial service. When he says no then tell him you would feel more comfortable controlling your own funds/investment.
Money Transmitters under Federal Law (might not be relevant to your country, sorry for the assumption)
On March 18, 2013, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) published guidance announcing that it would make no distinction between government (or “fiat”) currency and digital currencies like Bitcoin for the purposes of the money transmission laws. Thus, taking Bitcoin as an example:
* individuals and businesses who merely exchange Bitcoin for goods and services (and vice-versa) are not money transmitters.
* businesses that accept Bitcoin from one person and send it to another (or back to the same person) are money transmitters, and are not exempt from money transmission regulation simply because they do not deal in fiat currency.
* **any business that exchanges fiat currency for bitcoins** – or even one kind of digital currency for another – is a money transmitter.
* payment processors who accept Bitcoin from a merchant’s customers and pass dollars to the merchant are usually money transmitters.
Get a hardware wallet.Secure your recovery seed words. (ie learn about how to setup and properly use a wallet)Find a legit exchange that comply with your local laws.Buy coins on exchange that lets you withdraw the coinsUse your hardware wallet to secure your coins.

Now you will need to link your bank account/debit card to an exchange that accepts debit cards. Most exchanges prefer ACH transfers and will charge an additional fee for using a visa/debit/credit card.

Never take a picture of the words or store any part of the seed online or in digital form...
3 pieces of aluminum. - grade  **Type 316** i think 316 is the best for the added corrosion resistance but you may find a grade that works better for you.
Using a punch and stamp set mark one of the three plates with seed words (or equivalent), leave a min of a 1in space around the edge. Then edge weld all three plates together. Store the plate in a safe or other secure place. Fireproof, waterproof, tamper resistant, and for someone unprepared accessing it (the inner plate with the stamped words) will seem impossible (unless they have some metal working skills).
You can get a punch set for $20, a few pieces of high grade aluminium pretty cheaply. The edge welding part however could be tricky if you cant do it yourself or know someone you trust to weld it together for you.
You can then store it pretty much anywhere you think is safe. A physical safe, or foundation, wall, a GPS dead drop, all can work well enough for some however the exact location is up to you but I recommend somewhere that is highly inaccessible or known to anyone but you.
If you want to go that extra mile on top of all this you can use  **Shamir's Secret Sharing** to break it down in to multiple pieces. So that if 2 of 3 pieces of seeds are necessary or if 1 of 3 pieces are compromised you can still get your funds. This can help with disaster protection as well if you use multiple parts in separate locations if the locations are far enough apart.

I think its a great way to get started. A small monthly investment is how I started and over time I became more and more comfortable having larger and larger amounts invested into BTC. While I wouldn't plan on $100 a month making you rich overnight. Over time you can compare the results with your other investments or holdings and see if BTC is right for you. 
Look at  [  it may help give you some insight. 
Most new guys are interested in gains, overtime however you will begin to see that BTC is more of a passive protest to the current corrupt fiat legacy systems and controlling centralized authoritarian models.

Coinbase Pro
Current Maker Fee0.15%
Current Taker Fee0.25%
vs Normal Coinbase
Coinbase charges a Spread of about one-half of one percent (0.50%) for Digital Currency Purchases and Digital Currency Sales. However, the actual Spread may be higher or lower due to market fluctuations in the price of Digital Currencies on Coinbase Pro between the time we quote a price and the time when the order executes. 
We also charge a Coinbase Fee (in addition to the Spread), which is the greater of (a) a flat fee or (b) a variable percentage fee determined by region, product feature and payment type. The flat fees are set forth below:
* If the total transaction amount is less than or equal to $10, the fee is $0.99.
* If the total transaction amount is more than $10 but less than or equal to $25, the fee is $1.49.
* If the total transaction amount is more than $25 but less than or equal to $50, the fee is $1.99.
* If the total transaction amount is more than $50 but less than or equal to $200, the fee is $2.99.
In addtion to this they say the spread will only be about .5 % but ive found it varies much greater then that unless the market is flat... but if its moving you can over pay significantly.

I havent had any real issues with Coinbase and have used them for years, however I dislike how you have to use the Coinbase pro service unless you are willing to pay high fees. The fact that they charge such high fees on their non pro service seems a bit predatory to me. As new users usually wont figure out how to use the pro service they provide until after a few purchases.   
Use coinbasepro to avoid high fees, and then I suggest getting a hardware wallet so you can hold your own private keys.

Yup and currently that is part of why credit card companies charge you a % of that transaction to insure and secure it. Additionally when you are accepting a credit card transaction you are still at risk of the customer requesting a credit card chargeback.   
What you are looking for is an escrow service that can "insure a payment before its confirmed". These services usually cost money.   
As others have said hopefully lightning will make that a non needed service but we will have to see to find out.  
What concerns me more is that we have allowed for companies to set the pattern of "we pay them, then they ship the goods." which in reality I believe they should be sending the goods with an payment request and we pay when we receive them. I should have my product in my hand before I engage payment with bitcoin imo...
