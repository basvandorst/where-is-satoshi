What do you do?
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:20:02
Well, technically, i can afford to lose it, but it would hurt. I live at home with my parents (Long Island is expensive), I am turning 26 and don't expect to move out for a couple of years at least. The reason I am reluctant is cause that's two years of IRA investing I can never get back.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:45:50
Any idea of how to go about that through vanguard?
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:22:16
I get that. I guess it's the fact that if it hits say 30k, knowing that if I bought a full one at 11k and would be up 19k would be a shit feeling. Yeah, with any amount i will technically have gotten the same jump in returns, but 19k sounds a lot more appealing than a lot less than that considering i can (technically) find a way to afford it.

Totally aware of that but thanks for crunching the numbers! I am not planning on keeping the 6k in BTC, I would transfer 6k back before  the 60 days was up. Of course, the risk is losing that entire 6k but that would mean BTC crashing entirely, which is very unrealistic. With the hype around BTC right now, it's more likely it will steadily or slowly climb at the very least over a 45 day period, meaning I would make some decent bitcoin profits and come out with a lot more than if I just bought in 100 dollars worth every 2 weeks (basically what I can do now with my pay checks).

That's how I feel about it right now. Dipping to 9k is the worst I can see happening at the moment honestly.

LOL RIP you man

Putting all your investing into bitcoin will probably pay off big or leave you with little to nothing, I would say diversifying a bit is important. That's why i want to get into the BTC game more but wouldn't go 100% in.

Someone please stop me from taking enough out of my now 13.5k index fund roth ira to buy one whole bitcoin.
I keep telling myself it's a stupid idea, but it's hard not to do it. If bitcoin keeps trending up even half of what it has over the past year, the returns would still blow away what my Roth IRA would make over this year even with the market doing very well.
I have 125 bucks invested into BTC. The most i can afford is like 800 a month but it kills me to watch the price climbing and not owning a whole bitcoin to see the full gains.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:45:33
Yeah, am aware of that. Definitely risky but I am young, I can afford some risk.

Is that something I have to do immediately or at tax return time? How easy is it to do? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:46:47
I mean, it's only borrowing half my IRA, I am young and losing a years worth of that money won't hurt TOO much in the long run and has a chance of paying off. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:20:37
Roth IRA is honestly great, I would recommend doing both if you can. Index funds are awesome, I use vanguard. Time is the biggest factor with it, you want those compound interest gains.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:23:50
Yeah, I totally realize that, but I have faith that BTC is only going to keep trending up for awhile and, at the worst, stalling out.
To be honest, my biggest concern is the paperwork although I doubt it would be that difficult. Also wouldn't i have to pay taxes when i took the 6k back out of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:27:22
Same...it's tempting but I cannot afford to put heavy money into it at this stage in my life. Sucks, but at the end of the day it's more important that I can get by.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:27:38
I'm wondering the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:12:36
Honestly, it would hurt a bit, but I can afford to lose 6k out of my IRA and still be fine in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:40:35
I don't know if I can keep that promise LOL

Should i take 10k out of my 13k IRA roth and buy a whole bitcoin? Serious question. It's the only way i could afford one, and i'm 25 so it wouldn't exactly be a huge loss.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:46:48
I feel like this thing will keep rising though, and a whole bitcoin would allow me to get the full benefits of that. I already have 100 bucks in bitcoin, but that is hardly enough to feel this rise.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:04:14
Bought 25 bucks when it was down 10% lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:42:19
Thanks for the reply. That is kind of how I feel at the moment, I want to get more "in" before it's too late but at the same time my IRA Roth index fund has been returning almost 12% at an 80% stock 20% bond allocation. Also, i believe if you withdraw money from the money you put in your IRA Roth, you won't truly have the opportunity to put that money back in since the amount you put in is capped every year. 
The only thing i can truly afford without withdrawing from my IRA right now is putting in maybe 100 a week, I just feel like it's not good enough.

Interesting, thank you. Is it bad to not have a wallet?

Is coinbase the same thing as a wallet
