Wrong firm.
Usually quickest to get fast accurate answers by email. Rather than waste time speculating on incorrect information.

Yes I did advise yesterday evening it would be 24/36 hours. There are lots of people/lawyers involved all over the world. With the numerous time differences synchronising people and collating answers takes more time.

Does anyone have a screenshot or copy of Mt Gox terms of service / terms and conditions?
If yes - please email info(at)selachii.co.uk

 “If Mt Gox are not challenged legally, due to the current lack of regulation around the world and in Japan, it is likely they could walk away from this without giving an official explanation and without paying back any bitcoins.”

Agreed - but best to be 100% accurate! 
An even better way to resolve queries is talk on the phone or in person. 
If you want to discuss any points feel free to email and book a free initial meeting by phone / Skype or in person / London.

Re: Also hopefully Selachii collaborate with other law firms to collate the case together and hopefully reduce costs.
If you carefully read the proposal it does say this.

Is this a simple bankruptcy matter? There are lots if press reports that suggest theft / fraud etc

Because the ruling is incorrect and innacurate. I hope it is appealed. The claimant was not pegally represented. The court has no experience of btc. The judge will habe based his opinion on about 30 mins of research. 
The ruling sets no precedent for other courts outside of japan. The ruling is of little interest amd would have gone under the radar had it not been for a me tion of mt gox.
As btc develops then the law and understanding will develop. The courts in the uk recognise btc as a tangible asset hence why we i tained an injunction for delivery up of btc against a fraudster. 
It is a long journey and btc is at the very beginning. There will be mistakes along the way! Asking a judge to give a ruling on something he has little interest in or knowledge of is asking for trouble!
