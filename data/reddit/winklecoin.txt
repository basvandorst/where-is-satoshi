Suppose you are a Russian billionaire. For years, you have been converting your rubles to dollars and euros and depositing them in Western banks. You've been doing this to keep your money safe from Putin.
Now you have a new problem. Sanctions will likely freeze your bank accounts. They could be frozen for decades. You may die before those sanctions are lifted. So as this article explains, you are now busy converting your euro and dollar accounts to ruble accounts inside Russia. You are betting that the sanctions are a near certainty, while Putin seizing your accounts is uncertain. Better to go with the uncertain loss over the certain one.
This creates a new problem for you. Your Russian accounts will be denominated in rubles. The ruble is about to become a lot less valuable. Ruble accounts in Russia let you keep access to your funds, but you know you will take a large hit in the FX markets.
What if bitcoin markets were mature enough and bitcoin valuations high enough that tens of billions of dollars in bitcoins could move in a day? What if you could convert all of your euro and dollar accounts into bitcoins and put them in cold storage? You could put paper wallets and SD drives into safety deposit boxes in a dozen different countries around the world. No government could freeze your accounts because no government would know where they were. Your money wouldn't be denominated in a currency likely to face decimation. It would be denominated in a currency which, like gold, tended to gain value in times of trouble.
If you could do this, you would.
