I didn't even know what the internet was in 1997, much less 1994.  I remember being 13 years old, and me and my mother were connecting to the internet for the first time.  We went into an AOL chatroom and we were absolutely astounded that we were actually talking to real people in other parts of the world.
I remember when she got her first message from my now step-dad, she came and got me and said "I got an instant message from a guy in *another city!"*  It was so new and exciting for us.

Just walk in and whisper sensually to the cashier "Bitcoins...."

I'll leave this piece of paper with things this waiter obviously doesn't believe in.  That'll teach him to love Christians!

I've decided to move to Android because my iPhone has all but completely failed right at the end of my 2-year contract.  The battery randomly drops charge (it will be more than 90% charged and I'll do something simple like take a photo and it will shut off and say plug in to charge), it won't let me go on Facebook (spends 3-4 minutes loading and then shows me posts from 2 days ago, even if I set it to most recent), it randomly dumps text messages (I'll get text after text after text out of the blue, way faster than anyone could ever type, after not getting any texts for hours), and it's also started dropping calls after 2 years without having any problems with call clarity or network connectivity. 
So I'm ditching Verizon and ditching the iPhone and moving on.  I'm considering the Galaxy Note III.
