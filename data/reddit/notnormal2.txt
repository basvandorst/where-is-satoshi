this article is poor.   Did the author conflate private sector debt with sovereign nation debt owed in said nation's own currency?
The two types are different.  One has to be paid back, while the other doesn't.  Nation's national debt (denominated in own said nation's currency) is no problem since they can print their own money to honor those debts.  USA for example has a national debt in 20 Trillion dollars (denominated in US bonds).  This is not a problem since USA prints its own currency and can levy taxes and can honor all debts denominated in USD.  
So the 20 trillion national debt is net private sector savings to the penny:    
And is the reason why US stock market is all time highs and assets such as housing has mostly recovered.  
USA Nation's debt = good for the productive US economy that knows what to do with that money. 
While private sector debt is created out of thin air.  THe loan becomes the deposit, it balances instantly in the bank's account books.  Now that private sector debt has to be paid back and destroyed.  Too much private sector debt that can't be paid back causes defaults, and banks run into capital restraints and therefore cannot make any more loans thus causing a recession due to lack of liquidity in economy m2 money supply.   Private sector debt = economic cycle

one person's debt = another's savings.  We cannot all be savers at the same time.

You gotta think 3 dimensionally.   If it weren't for the loss of those bitcoins, then the bitcoins of today wouldn't be worth as much.  It's like token burning.  The remaining ones will be worth much more.

bank loans are restricted by capital constraints.  If their assets are healthy, they can make more loans.  Fractional reserve banking is an outdated model.  It only applies to interbank lending. Not to businesses and average joe consumer borrower.

Loans are created out of thin air.  
Banks DO NOT lend your deposits to other borrowers.  Banks only lend your deposits to other banks in the banking system.

you are wrong.  Most of the debt is private sector debt, and it is the commercial bank's decision to make those loans out of thin air.  THe central bank does NOT create loans, they create reserves to help any banks that are capital constraint, but those reserves have to be paid back thus closing the circuit.   During normal times, commercial banks DO NOT borrow from the central bank because it is taboo to borrow from the lender of last resort because it shows you are in so much trouble that other banks won't even lend you their excess reserves.   
the problem is modern capitalism where commercial bank loans go more toward asset speculation and less on manufacturing and local productivity.

zimbabwe destroyed their productivity, the printing of money came AFTER their currency and economy was devalued.  Venezuela borrowed much money in foreign debt.  WHen oil price dropped, one dimensional economy Venezuela got hurt.  Russia ruble also was hurt with oil drop.

by the time I get my bitcoins/ether in 6 days, I will be able to buy more iota than I initially thought if Iota goes down in the coming days.
