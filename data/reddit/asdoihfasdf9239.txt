this logic would doom bitcoin to a certain death.  If the community isn't ready for a one-line code change for a routine scaling upgrade described by Satoshi back in 2008 after 18 months of discussion, we'll never be ready.  And if we can never upgrade the code by HF at all, we will eventually be rendered obsolete or killed of by some crisis like quantum computing when we can't agree to HF to change the algorithm.

When people talk about "rushed" they generally mean in one of two contexts: Rushed because the code has not been reviewed thoroughly enough and may be buggy, or Rushed because there hasn't been enough discussion and thought and social consensus.  The simplicity of the code rules out part 1.  


Then cryptocurrencies probably aren't for you.  They're not democracies and were never intended to be.  They're somewhat hashocracies, but even that is misleading.  As Satoshi's whitepaper explained, bitcoin is controlled by miners and "economically important full nodes" (mostly exchanges and the very biggest companies.)

Ethereum had 2 prior HFs that resulted in its price appreciating 1000% and giving ethereum the 2nd largest market cap in the crypto space.

I'll do you one better, I'll name several.
Ver was one of the very first non-cryptographers to recognize bitcoin's potential.  He acted on it by buying large quantities of bitcoins.  He then used these bitcoins to create the early bitcoin growth we know and love today.  He introduced a larger percentage of early bitcoiners to bitcoin via speaking at conferences and giving away many hundreds of bitcoins to people who expressed even the slightest interest.
He also directly funded many of the companies that formed the early bitcoin backbone and enabled growth like Blockchain.info and Bitpay.
The people who compose the "anyone else" are everyone else in the world.  There were a few people who recognized bitcoin's potential before Ver, hence the "almost" anyone else.  And there are a few people who probably did more to popularize Ver, like Brian Armstrong.

Willy-nilly?  You must not have been paying attention for the last 18 months.  Satoshi explained the reason to HF for scaling way back in 2008.
Those "scam artists" included Adam Back proposing a 2-4-8 scaling solution more than a years ago, and almost all of the big mining pools saying they wanted HF to at least that over a year ago.  The only scam artists I see here is you lying about what miners and devs have publicly said.
@_date: 2016-08-02 17:38:35
I'm honestly unclear on what you're struggling with.  Every HF produces at least 2 chains with shared history.  Literally anyone can HF at any time simply by changing a line of code and running the new client as their node.  No one ever knows for sure in advance which will survive (although we can make very educated guesses).  When both chains survive, there are simply two cryptocurrencies.  As long as they have different names, it's very easy to tell them apart.  
You may be struggling to distinguish between ETH and ETC, but no one else is.  It's quite easy.  Just look at the last letter.

If this was true I would immediately dump every BTC I own because it would mean bitcoin has become completely centralized.

@_date: 2016-08-04 16:33:25


Perfect example that contradicts your argument.  The decision to wear a blue or black shirt is like Bitfinex's option to properly register or abandon cold storage.  Earlier you argued this wasn't really a choice, since the two options themselves were being presented by the government.  Similarly, while you can wear a blue or black shirt, in most climates you can't choose to wear *no shirt* or you'll catch hypothermia.  


No because the employees fear the legal repercussions.  And because we know they fear those repercussions, we have the confidence to trade on the platform.

Let me dumb it down for you:  Bitcoin Classic is a particular instantiation of a HF that people don't like, therefore it has little hash power.  Those very same miners say they *desperately want* to throw their hashpower behind a similar HF, they just want it to be developed by Core.
@_date: 2016-08-02 15:08:31
Most of the large mining pools have very explicitly said that they would immediately support and mine a forked chain with a 2 MB (or even 8 MB) blocksize, but only if they viewed is as uncontentious; they asked Core to distribute the fork.
This was kind of the final result of all the bickering, in which most big miners said they would wait for Core to release the HF:

@_date: 2016-08-04 01:27:15
If you'll bear with me, let me build the up the idea from the ground up.
A person can obviously benefit from money and can make decisions.  
A company is an abstract idea.  if I ask you to point to Walmart, you can't.  You might point to their headquarters, but that's just a building; they could easily change headquarters with no meaningful change to the company.  You could point at the current CEO or at current employees, but again those can and do change quickly and easily.  But while a "company" can't make decisions (only people can), most countries grant companies legal rights similar to people, and it's useful to think of the decisions made by the people who run companies as being made by the companies themselves.  Similarly, while a company (as an abstract idea) can't literally benefit from money, it's useful to pretend that it can.  Companies generally act as though they're people and pursue money.  We know that what's really going on is that the people running the company are competing and coordinating with one another to guide the company for various goals, but in aggregate, it looks a lot like a single entity.  Can a company benefit from money?  Not literally (since a company isn't a thing, can't feel pleasure or pain etc), but figuratively yes, and it's a generally accurate and useful fiction to think that a company benefits from money.
Now what I just did for companies, you're trying to do for government.  You're trying to treat the government as an entity that makes decisions and wants money (or can benefit from money.)  But I don't think that's a useful or accurate way of looking at it.  
To the extent we want to think of the government like a company, than its shareholders are its citizens.  So what benefits "the government" is really just benefiting you and me and every other citizen.  But maybe you want to argue that "the government" is really the bureaucrats (i.e. employees) who make up "the government."  But here again, those bureaucrats tend not to benefit very directly with the economic inflows or outflows of the government.  If IRS tax collection doubles, bureaucrats generally don't see their pay double (if at all).  If the US government cuts costs tremendously, Obama doesn't get to pay himself a billion dollar bonus at the end of the year.
"The government" as a self-interest entity isn't a useful fiction.  Rather, I think you can sometimes think of individual departments as entities.  For example, it's true that the Department of Education would rather not be eliminated by Ted Cruz.  Now obviously "the Department of Education" is just an abstract idea, but the bureaucrats who work there will certainly do what they can to preserve their jobs.

Unambiguity: Do you really have trouble distinguishing ETC from ETH?  do you get confused between bitcoin and ethereum?  Most people don't find these ambiguous at all.
Immutability:  All block chains can be forked.  That was true 2 months ago and it's true today.  Ethereum had been forked at least twice prior to the DAO bailout.  Were you unaware of the previous HFs?  Was this the first time you realized a blockchain was mutable?

Of course.  The point is that man's natural state is not to be completely free of limitations.  It's really just very simple tradeoffs.  If you want to live in a non-tropical climate, you'll have to wear clothes.  If you want to be part of a society that allows for a life expectancy beyond age 25, you have to accept social restrictions.  
Also consider that societal restrictions actually arise partly from our biology.  Humans evolved as social animals.  Literally - our genetics incorporates natural selection within the context of group hunting and gathering.  Basic specialization between the sexes is one example of this.  And similarly, the near-universal basic societal rules that arose independently in nearly every culture (like taboos on cannibalism and incest) arose from our biology.

This suggests you don't understand how blockchains work.  Ethereum has hard forked twice before.  Would you argue that ethereum was therefore ambiguous 2 months ago?  Many cryptos have hard forked.  Each fork is its own cryptocurrency.  No ambiguity.


A hard fork is always performed the same way and always results in at least 2 blockchains.

Most companies try to optimize.  If you buy the servers to handle traffic at the 0.01% peak times, than you've got crazy excess capacity 90% of the time, which means lower profits or higher fees to your customers.  That's why this exact same issue of servers going down due to excess volume has happened to literally every stock market, every bitcoin exchange, and every commodities exchange around the world.

I condemn any and all attacks on nodes; an attack on any consensus node is an attack on the bitcoin network.  There are scumbags supporting both clients and who would attack nodes of the other side, and I condemn then when they do.
As for BU itself - I'm not a fan.  I view it as a ugly last ditch effort.  Much of the bitcoin ecosystem begged Core for a scaling solution 2 years ago and specifically for a quick HF to moderately bigger blocks while we await longer term solutions like Lightning.  Core refused completely, so we've gotten a series of attempts at providing what the bitcoin community demands.  Many of those attempts have been arguably worse than the problem itself, but overall I blame Core for producing this situation.

Nothing "willy nilly" about it.  It's been debated and researched for 18 months.  A year ago the dominant proposal was for an increase to **8** MB.  That's been lowered 75% to avoid losing all but the absolute most archaic full nodes.  
*"Larger block size puts large mining conglomerates at a big advantage, and the "average Joe" at a disadvantage."*
This is accurate in theory, and might've applied to the 8 MB increase.  But technology advances.  1 MB in 2014 is equivalent to 2 MB in 2016 in terms of both bandwith and processing power.  Most mining is currently concentrated in Chinese mining pools.  The best way to mitigate this imo, is to grow the bitcoin ecosystem.
*The risk of encouraging further centralizaton of mining power is very real, and much, much worse than an infinitesimal "big cost to doing nothing".*
Again, the centralization effect is directly tied to the size of the increase.  An increase to 20 MB blocks?  Yes, that would have a large impact on full node count.  An increase to 2 MB?  We'd likely lose just 5-10% of current full nodes.
Perhaps most importantly - I think increasing the block size will actually *increase* full node count and decentralization.  By encouraging user adoption, an increase in the token bitcoin price, and the birth of more bitcoin companies, we increase the number of people who are likely to run full nodes.

If a crash is triggered and sustained by something that people don't actually care about, than that same crash would have happened anyway.  It just would have been a different trigger.

That's what superconsensus means...an overwhelming majority of miners, of economically important full nodes, and of users...it already exists.  The vast majority of all groups have said they will hop on a Bitcoin Core 2 MB HF.

This is like saying that because someone survived a previous heart attack that they will survive the next one.
A halving is not significant in itself.  It's significant in relation to the current monetary incentives for mining.  When mining is very lucrative, a mining is a non-event.  When mining is only marginally profitable, a halving leads to a dramatic reduction in hash power which can cause big problems.
@_date: 2016-06-29 20:08:57
Jesus, this again?  Bitcoin isn't just a technological platform.  It's also an economic ecosystem, a currency, and a commodity.  The debate isn't over the technicals - we all agree that a 2 MB HF will result in a small percentage of the most obsolete full nodes being kicked off the network.  The price has been in a 2.5 year bear market partly because adoption and innovation have slowed.  The questions are:
1.  Is it a good tradeoff to lose 5-25% of current full nodes to reduce fee vs encouraging fees to rise?
2. How much of an effect will lower vs higher fees have on bitcoin adoption and infrastructure investment?
3.  Would more adoption and infrastructure investment indirectly result in more full nodes?

@_date: 2016-06-07 20:20:35
I'm not predicting a crisis; it's actually pretty straightforward:
Most hash power belongs to big mining businesses that act in their economic interest.  Whether they mine (and with which rigs they mine) just depends on the profitability.  There's no reason to mine at a loss - if they want to accumulate BTC, they could just buy some with the money they'd otherwise be spending on electricity to mine.
If the price of BTC is too low when the halvening happens, the hash power will drop a lot.  This will result in longer confirmation times until the difficulty adjusts.  If has power falls by half, then confirmation times will double for about 1 month.  Such a scenario is both likely and not terribly problematic.
The more serious problem would be if has power fell by, say, 75% and confirmation times go up 4x.  And as a result, the price of bitcoin falls substantially, leading to yet further drop in hash power, still longer confirmations, and a difficulty reset that is now 3+ months away.  
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:21:00

@_date: 2016-06-27 17:22:31
First, increasing block size didn't come from miners, it came from core devs.  Adam Back was proposing a 2-4-8 HF scaling solution about a year ago.  
Second, we don't need to be paranoid, we can simply examine any HF proposals, regardless of where they come from.  We should expect all members of the bitcoin community to be fundamentally self-interested.  That includes devs, holders, companies, exchanges, and miners.  When someone proposes a HF, we can all consider the specific proposal and see if we like it.  We shouldn't accept *or* reject it based on who had the idea first, but rather on its merits.
Third, with huge blocks, the fee is zero, or very close to zero.  Miners get screwed.  Fees only become significant when blocks are nearing capacity.  The smaller the block, the higher the fees.  If you made blocks 100 kb, fees would skyrocket immediately.  If you made blocks 4 MB, fees would plummet to near zero.  At first glance, miners want the smallest blocks possible.  *But*, miners have invested heavily in the long-term success of bitcoin via their equipment.  And they understand that larger blocks may facilitate faster bitcoin adoption and growth and a rise in token value (which increases the value of the block reward in fiat terms.)  So some miners favor larger blocks because even know it will reduce the fees they collect, they think it will benefit the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, raise BTC prices, and result in a higher block reward for them in dollar terms.

Ahahahahaa.  You guys are hilarious.  You think basic business fundamentals are FUD.  
This really isn't that complicated.  The network effect is powerful and means that the dominant player in an industry will not be replaced by *slightly* better competitors because of switching costs.  For example, if someone started offering a product identical to an iphone for $0.05 less, Apple would not be in trouble, because $0.05 isn't enough of an advantage to get people to abandon their trusted brand.  
But if the value proposition is superior by a *big* margin, than people start switching and the market leader gets replaced.  So far, no crypto has offered a *big* improvement over bitcoin.  If bitcoin remains stagnant, eventually they will.  As someone who holds a ton of BTC, I hope BTC maintains its lead through continued innovation.

There's a massive difference between offering non-financial service and facilitating financial transactions.  With the former, a glitch might just mean that someone pulls up a blank webpage or a wrong page is displayed.  With the latter, it might mean that huge amounts of money are sent to the wrong place.  With bitcoin, the transfer might be irreversible.
The very biggest stock exchanges, that have armies of the top tech talent in the world, with huge investments in redundancy, still routinely have long stretches of down time.  
Here's a long list for you. London stock exchange closed once for 7 hours and once for 8 hours recently. Lots of other exchanges closed for 2-6 hours. 
Here's a recent example from the NYSE - one of the world's largest and oldest stock exchanges going down for 4 hours...and they don't have to worry about irreversible thefts of their capital....

I agree that HFs should be done rarely and only with strong consensus, and for reasons that in no way undermine the bitcoin value proposition.  We should never HF to transfer bitcoins.
The HF for blocksize is about as simple and clear as it gets to me.  
1. It's extremely simple from a coding perspective.  Minimal (if not zero) risk for coding problems.  It doesn't change how bitcoin works at all programatically.  Very easy for all community members to understand the change.  
2.  There's no major conflict of interest.  There's no particular party or group that benefits at the cost of other groups from allowing blocks to double with the massive increase in transaction volume we've seen.  If anything, we'd be keeping the economics of bitcoin more static than by doing nothing.  It certainly doesn't reflect any change in the vision of what bitcoin is or should be.  In contrast, keeping blocks small as transaction volume rises is arguably a much sharper change in what bitcoin is and how it works.  It's a change that most people (and Satoshi) expected to happen later in the bitcoin lifecycle.  We expected fees to start rising substantially only after the block reward was much smaller.  
3.  Sidechains and L2 solutions might be all bitcoin needs to scale, but those aren't really implemented yet.  LN is likely a year away (certainly at least 6 months).  Doing nothing in the mean time entails a lot of risk, including the risk that bitcoin ceases to exist.  I don't mean this as FUD, but as an honest assessment from someone who is a bitcoin believer with about 50% of my wealth in BTC.  Bitcoin is in beta mode, and sometimes it feels like the community thinks we're IBM.  We're still a new technology and we've only hit 1% of our potential.  Treating it as a mature technology with much to lose is potentially suicide.  We have competition and will have more competition in the future.  Creating a period of 6 or 12 or 18 months where fees become substantially higher than the alternatives is kind of like when Friendster failed to scale their servers fast enough - the temporary slowness of Friendster gave room for Myspace to swoop in and steal users.  Bitcoin has a powerful network effect advantage, but we can squander it if we're not careful.  There's nothing magical about bitcoin as a cryptocurrency.  *Some* cryptocurrency is going to have a $50 billion market cap in 10 years, but it doesn't have to be bitcoin, and it won't if we provide a substantially worse value proposition to the world.
In conclusion, I see almost no cost to a 2 MB HF, and a big cost to doing nothing.  The major cost cited by Core to a HF is a loss of decentralization - some old nodes in China and emerging markets may fall off the network.  We have to way the cost of a loss of a small number of inefficient nodes against slowing bitcoin's growth and what I believe to be an existential risk that a competitor will seize the opportunity we're offering them to provide a better value proposition with lower fees and faster and more consistent confirmation times.

Putting your fingers in your ears doesn't change reality.  Bitcoin has a massive surge of adoption between 2010 and 2013.  Since then adoption has slowed.  **The biggest bitcoin businesses are telling us that higher fees and unconfirmed transactions are slowing the growth of new bitcoin users.**

This isn't accurate.  Literally every major stock and commodity exchange in the world has down time each year.  In these cases, the main software fails, and the backup fails, and the backup of the backup fails.  It happens.  It's part of running an exchange.  Literally every single large exchange, including the most famous and richest like NYSE have these problems.
No one amount of planning or foresight will prevent all problems.  
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:23:57
One reason they haven't gained traction is because bitcoin fees have been low.  If BTC transaction fees are $0.02 for example, a $0.01 fee isn't much of an advantage.  If BTC fees rise to $0.50, suddenly a $0.01 fee coin might start gaining traction.  To take it to an extreme, if BTC fees were $5 and expected to stay at $5 for 2 years, I would bet a huge sum of money that an alternative would start to gain traction; all sorts of bitcoin companies would be looking for a lower fee alternative to facilitate transactions.

The reason to increase capacity while we await a long-term scaling solution that is still far off is to facilitate bitcoin adoption and growth.  It's not rocket science.
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:25:45
First, there's no intrinsic connection between past and future returns, at all.  We're just talking about past returns.
Second, I'm saying the annual return is inaccurate because it only applies to a small subset of bitcoins and was only accessible by a subset of bitcoin investors.  Bitcoin, the asset that exists today, did not earn those returns.  
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:25:59
That's not even remotely accurate.  Ethereum has a market cap of $1.3 billion.  The only other crypto to ever achieve that was bitcoin.  Ethereum today is very roughly 10% of the total crypto universe.  Only litecoin ever achieved that, and litecoin was very explicitly a bitcoin clone with one minor change that users didn't value.
I totally agree that ethereum is a "solution looking for a problem."  I'm not claiming it will be a success or that it will threaten bitcoin.  I'm simply claiming that ethereum or some other new crypto *could* kick bitcoin off its thrown *if* that new crypto introduced innovations that users tremendously valued.  And sooner or later *some* crypto will innovate, because that's how technology works.   
Your last sentence is totally wrong though.  The whole point is that unlike bitcoin, ethereum changes rapidly.  When their development team sees a structural flaw, they simply fix it.  Nothing is set in stone; ethereum can simply adopt the best features from any crypto.  Now, that malleability is obviously a potential liability for a "store of value."  If you buy ethereum today, you don't really know what you're getting.  In contrast, a decent number of bitcoin owners don't care about the future growth and innovation - they just want to make sure that the bitcoin they own today will be the same in 5 years.
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:12:01
That's not accurate.  The value proposition collapses if someone introduces *better* sound money - like a crypto that is more secure and more efficient.

This is kind of like asking Satoshi, why stop at 21 million coins and not 21 trillion?
Because we balance different costs and benefits to come up with reasonable compromises.  A HF to a 40 MB would render most current full nodes unusable.  Staying at 1 MB reduces the pace of bitcoin adoption by substantially increasing fees and increasing confirmation times.  There's some happy medium that facilitates bitcoin growth without losing many full nodes.  2 MB is a super conservative compromise between those two goals.
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:05:55
ahahaha.  Are you really left with making the argument that Bitfinex is criminally incompetent because while 8 hours of downtime is routine for some of the world's largest and most respected stock exchanges, 12 hours is a little bit longer?   8 hours reflects a reasonable recovery strategy but 12 means Bitfinex is incompetent?
Thanks for the laugh man.
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:47:39
I agree.  But of course peoples' perception of value is connected to fundamentals.  For example, the price tag of a lamborghini may be mostly brand value (perception), but they could never cultivate a perception of luxury if the cars were falling apart and couldn't get over 60 mph.  Perception is usually at least loosely connected to reality.  This is why it's unlikely that bitcoin holders would suddenly decide tomorrow that bitcoin is worthless and they want to hold dogecoin instead.  
So back to the point - peoples' perception of the value proposition of bitcoin depends on what bitcoin offers - its security, its transaction speed, its costs etc.  And...the alternatives.  Let's say an altcoin comes out tomorrow that all crypto experts agree is *more* secure and *more* efficient (cheaper transactions).  That crypto might never gain steam because of the network effect, but it might...and once it gained a decent amount of steam, it would almost certainly start attracting bitcoin users since it is a superior product.
The point is that bitcoin is like any new technological product - it must keep evolving or it will quickly be rendered obsolete.  Obsolete products sometimes stick around for a while due to network effect, but eventually they die.
@_date: 2016-06-27 21:13:08

Are you really confusing current versus future value?  
Here's how it typically works:  the first mover in a space provides a new product.  People value that product, so the first mover accrues benefit, in this case $11b.  Over time, other entrants enter the market and compete on various axes.  When there's a strong network effect (as there is in social media and cryptocurrency), a competitor can't simply modestly improve on the first mover.  That's not enough.  Users won't switch to a new crypto or a new social media site over something small (as litecoin discovered).  Rather, a competitor must offer a substantially improved product that renders the incumbent obsolete (think facebook mostly replacing myspace, google mostly replacing yahoo, etc).  Crypto is a young space, with lots of innovation still happening.  The best crypto in 10 years will be much better than what bitcoin is now.  Either bitcoin itself will improve to retain its lead, or it will be mostly replaced by a much better alternative.  If a much better alternative exists, bitcoins' value proposition collapses, since the value of a product is compared to the value of existing alternatives.

Doesn't apply here.  A return calculation requires a starting price and a length of time.  The point is that for any starting time we pick, we're only calculating a CAGR for a subset of bitcoins that currently exist, so it's misleading to imply that it's the return for bitcoin in general.

Fees are radically slowing adoption and eliminating entire economies (like microtransactions) from even getting off the ground.  Showing that *some* growth is happening is not evidence against that.

I agree entirely with your logic.  And it's possible that, at the margin, people(s) decided to spend some money to make the memepool more overloaded.  I don't assume that to be the case though, since transaction volume was rising relatively steadily to the point of filling many blocks, and then we got a volume spike shortly after the price jumped.  In other words, the "steady state" of bitcoin today is of nearly full blocks, and it's totally plausible to me that the recent rally caused a surge in transaction volume (as people are now looking to move BTC on to exchanges, to spend it, or to move BTC they just bought off of exchanges etc.  As to your point about how much extra volume this should produce - I have no idea.  I've never seen a detailed breakdown of typical transaction volume.)/

I think it's a certainty that new cryptos will be born in the next few years (or already exist that I haven't heard of) with powerful new features that users value.  Those features may be things like better architecture to facilitate cheaper and faster transactions, or might be totally new features (something like ethereum's smart contracts.)  I don't know - the only thing certain is that technology presses forward.  Bitcoin will have the option of co-opting the features that are most valuable and that fit within the ecosystem (like how big tech companies buy and integrate small upstarts), or it won't and may be replaced (or at least relegated to a small corner of the crypto world like what Myspace is today).
Zcash is only in alpha so it's tough to evaluate, but why do you think it couldn't be a threat?  Let's say Zcash creates a crypto that is objectively more anonymous, more secure, and cheaper for transactions.  Why wouldn't it threaten bitcoin?
I think by the time a competitor is gaining real traction, it's potentially too late to jump in front of them and co-opt those features.  
@_date: 2016-06-29 19:20:32
Not at all...You disputed that many core devs had researched a HF.

Right, and the issue is that the 82% figure was impossible for everyone to get, because not enough bitcoin existed.  I'm having trouble thinking of a great analogy, so let me try this stylized example.
Let's say on January 1st the US government issues a bond that yields 10%, but they only offer them to 10 people.  Then on January 2nd, the US government offers a bond that yields 2% and 20 million people buy it.  A year later we're discussing the return on US government bonds and someone says it was 10%.  I say no, that was only the return on a tiny fraction of government bonds.  Sure, if you were one of those 10 people you earned 10%, but it's misleading to suggest that 10% was the return for government bonds in general.  The real return for government bonds was something like 2.0001%.  As a possible investment for investors as a whole, the return was 2%.

I never mentioned ethereum as a likely competitor.  It is worth noting that it wasn't "hacked" though.  Someone simply found an exploit in a single smart contract.  It's the equivalent of an exchange having their bitcoin stolen by an employee who works there.  The ethereum community is hotly debating whether to roll back the transaction.  It's not obvious to me which way is better for ethereum to be adopted as a smart contract platform.  As HF advocates repeatedly note - businesses and most people in the "real world" expect and prefer for contract bugs that are obviously against the intent of the contract to be overruled by human discretion.  The counterargument is that such traditional contracts already exist, and ethereum should offer an *alternative* to what people already know and like.
Regardless, if you think bitcoin is actually going to become a standard for transactions without becoming much more heavily regulated, you're dreaming.  My best guess is that bitcoin becomes digital gold, but never becomes popular for transactions.  Some other platform, most likely fiat-denominated and centralized will become the standard for transactions (since most people have no interest in a separate currency or decentralization for buying coffee.)  Ethereum or something like it will become the standard for lots of cool technological stuff (like how airBNB has already integrated ethereum into some of their rentals).  My concern is that bitcoin could even lose the "digital gold" status to a competitor that offers a better value proposition.  Just one example - Edward Snowden recently recommended the work-in-progress Z-cash.  It's a new crypto that will have built-in anonymity far superior to bitcoin's pseudoanonymity, and possibly faster confirmation times and lower transaction costs.  It's easy to imagine something like that quickly becoming preferred for darknet transactions, for example.
There's nothing unique about cryptocurrency.  It's an industry like any other - with constant new entrants and innovation.  First mover advantage is powerful, but the first mover is usually replaced by a new entrant that is more nimble and innovative.

I think what often happens is people aren't trying to hide money, their marriage is great...and then things change.  The divorce comes, and suddenly they want that money to be hidden.  What people often don't realize is that there's no burden on the court to prove that you have the money.

Satoshi's idea was that the block reward would sustain POW mining for the first 20 years or so of bitcoin's life.  *After* bitcoin has widespread adoption, *then* fees rise a little.  They shouldn't ever have to rise much because higher *volume* results in higher miner fees even if each fee is unchanged.  If we jump the gun and raise fees too early we simply retard growth and create room for a major crypto competitor with a better value proposition.

No one cares about bitfinex (except people with funds stuck on the exchange or who just lost money).  It has no relevance to the broader bitcoin project.

Classic was a clusterfuck.  But here's the thing people don't get: not even classic wanted classic.  Gavin had zero interest in running a bitcoin team.  That's why when Satoshi gave Gavin control of development, he said, "nope, not interested."  Gavin only very reluctantly started classic after it became clear that Core simply refused to respond to community demands.  It was the opposite of "hijacking."  It was more like, "if you guys, really really really need me to provide code because no one else will do it, fine I will..."  The entire time classic said they would disband immediately if Core provided the scaling solutions that the community was demanding.
I have no issues with Core as a development team.  They're indisputably the top talent currently.  My problem is with the way governance currently works.  What *should* happen is Core presents an update to the community and the community decides if we want to adopt it.  If we don't like it, we tell Core what we don't like and then Core either changes it, or some other team produces what the community wants and we're free to adopt it.
Today instead we have: either go with Core or scorched earth hellfire.  People accuse you of trying to destroy bitcoin, you get censored, and Core itself threatens to destroy miners who adopt alternative implementations by hardforking the mining algorithm to put them out of business.  It's dictatorial and problematic for a crypto that claims to be decentralized.

1. The core devs are great coders, but bitcoin is more than code.  It is an economic ecosystem, a currency, and a commodity too.  The devs are very clearly prioritizing decentralized full nodes and all the good that comes with it over everything else.  Most bitcoin businesses think that Core isn't doing their job - they're not facilitating user adoption and growth.  We've had the option and desire to quickly increase capacity for more than a year, but have completely failed to.  The delay imposes substantial costs.  My concern is that much of the community is underestimating the costs.  We may wake up in 6 months and realize that bitcoin has a serious competitor that threatens its existence because we've been too slow to innovate in this fast changing field of cryptocurrency.
2. Satoshi's original vision was for fees to eventually replace the block reward as mining incentive, *after* bitcoin is much more mature.  We are retarding bitcoin growth at a critical inflection point.  Eventually LN may very well eliminate the need for bigger blocks, but LN doesn't exist yet.  As for the level of fees - consider that different transactions have different value.  The fact that *some* transactions go through with a $1 fee doesn't mean that we're not sacrificing *many* transactions that will go through with a $0.10 fee, but not a higher fee.  In economics this is known as the downward sloping demand curve.  More users demand a product/service at a lower price than at a higher price.  Bitcoin with a high fee will have fewer users and provide less value than bitcoin with a low fee.  
  Specifically, there are entire use cases that are eliminated with high fees.  I was hoping bitcoin would create a whole new system of commerce on the internet for microtransactions - users could pay $.03 to read a newspaper article.  But with bitcoin fees at $0.07, that whole area of innovation is killed.
3.  Don't underestimate the pace of change.  Myspace went from the only game in town to a historical footnote to Facebook very quickly.  By the time you see the warning signs it may be too late.  
Imagine if someone like Bill Gates, or IBM, or a consortium of banks decides to build a new crypto and is willing to spend $5 billion to do so.  In 6 months they could:
1. Hire a stable of world-class developers that puts bitcoin's to shame; a thousand top notch developers working full-time compared to bitcoin's dozen full-timers.
2. Integrate with as many or more merchants/banks/payroll companies as bitcoin (look at how fast ApplePay integrated).
3. Mindshare: imagine if Facebook decided to throw a ton of money at marketing a new crypto, ads everywhere, messages to every user, etc...
Bitcoin is vulnerable.  In the tech world, it's innovate or die.

Actually they did...all of those examples were of no prior notice.  They closed suddenly because of technical problems, and users had no idea when they'd be back up.  Identical to bitfinex as far as I can see.  The only interesting criticism I've heard of bitfinex is about how they handled stop-limit orders.
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:04:03
You're making a common mistake.  If volume spikes *after* submitting a transaction, then no matter how good your wallet is at dynamic fees, your transaction will still get stuck.  But perhaps more importantly, this has been a problem for 6+ months and most of the commonly used bitcoin sites still don't have good enough dynamic fees to avoid it.  Saying you should use "that site anymore" is basically advising people to stop using bitcoin in favor of cryptos that have solved this problem.

Transactions getting stuck indefinitely, and needlessly high fees isn't a flaw?  You know there are other cryptos with the same level of security but near zero fees and faster propagation right?  Literally the only reason bitcoin has such high fees and such low confirmation reliability is because bitcoin core wants to accommodate nodes in China that are basically running dial-up.  That's not a flaw?  lol.

I've actually only dabbled in bitcoin trading.  My day job is trading equity options and commodity options for a wall st firm.  In bitcoin I've mostly been a holder as well, just trying to take advantage of the occasional big extreme in sentiment every 6 months or so.  The one sentence description of that strategy is when you see the price make a 30%+ move and it seems super obvious that the trend must continue and everyone on reddit is sure the trend will continue, bet the opposite direction.
@_date: 2016-09-21 15:58:07
Professional trader here.  Humans desperately look for patterns in everything, but real life has lots of "noise."  In any market, there are tens of thousands of buyers and sellers, each with their own personal motivations.  One morning someone might wake up, decide they want to buy a yacht, and therefore need to sell $1 million worth of bitcoin to finance the purchase.  Someone else might decide they want to shift $10 million of their personal wealth from gold to bitcoin etc etc.  We almost never know about the motivations, but most price fluctuations come from stuff like this.  
When you add in all the speculative momentum traders, a relatively small move can become big just because people chase the price movement looking for profits.
Manipulation is actually very hard to profit from.  You make money by buying low and selling high, which requires that you be a *market maker.*  To manipulate the market you have to do the opposite which means you're very likely to lose money unless you can create a cascading effect in which other traders react to your trade and continue pushing markets in the direction you want.  Manipulation happens, but it's a lot rarer than people think.  Most market movement is "noise" of the type I described earlier.

For very small price moves, I partially agree.  But consider that the people with larger quantities of BTC or more money stand ready to buy large sums of BTC at "value" prices or take profits in a sharp rally.  This is what we saw when the price dipped to $200 initially or &lt;$500 more recently and when it rallied up towards $800.  Any manipulator who was pushing BTC up and buying at $770 or $790 lost their shirt.
@_date: 2016-09-21 15:56:10
"bitcoin" can't be political.  It can't think or have opinions because it's not a person.  And no one runs it or controls it.  It's decentralized.  Any very rich person or government can move the price of bitcoin, but only with a high likelihood of losing lots of money via slippage.
@_date: 2016-09-21 17:04:36
They certainly could do that, but it'd be far simpler.  There's no need for a cartel or cabal.  The Federal Reserve or ECB or Chinese Government or Putin himself could personally sell bitcoin down to near zero with their pocket change.  We simply haven't seen that.  Why would those entities sell bitcoin down to say $400 and not $50?  Why not destroy it?
@_date: 2016-05-31 16:32:28
It's definitely complicated, but I literally can't think of any way in which the clearing house system differs from direct ownership that's relevant to this discussion.  With things like commodity ETNs, there's a huge difference between owning the commodity and owning the ETN since buying the ETN doesn't necessarily reduce supply of the commodity.  But with the clearing house system, each bond is still owned only once, each share of equity is still owned only once.  The intermediation can create some very short-term snafus (like when 3 separate people all think they own the same bond and it takes 48 hours to fix things), but those issues are very short-lived and relatively trivial. 
  Similarly, from a legal perspective, there's no difference.  To my knowledge, no one has ever lost access to their asset because of the intermediation system, and the kind of scenario where they might (like an EMP destroys all electronic records), would still effect you even if you directly owned a corporate bond (since ownership of the bond is still just an electronic record).
@_date: 2016-05-31 15:43:50
You've totally reversed cause and effect.  Satoshi was saying that difficult and cost would change to match the price of bitcoin - not the other way around.  Your confusion likely comes from his first sentence which refers to pre-existing commodities.  Bitcoin is obviously very different from most commodities in that *unlike just about every other commodity, supply does not change meaningfully in response to price.*  If the price of bitcoin went up 10x tomorrow, the supply of bitcoins would not change much since difficulty would adjust as new miners come online.  In contrast, if the price of crude oil went up 10x, the supply of crude oil might go up 4x over the next year.

This is incorrect.  Every bitcoin transaction is totally traceable, public even.  In contrast, a transaction with fiat cash is generally untraceable.  
@_date: 2016-05-16 21:29:32
Incorrect.  The transaction itself is fully traceable and public with bitcoin.  Not so with fiat cash or DASH.  What you mean to say is that with bitcoin people can't *automatically connect* that public traceable transaction to a human being, which is correct, but relatively trivial.

I was a professional trader for many years, but never traded simple equity (I did equity derivatives and commodities).  So, I'm not a real expert on this issue, but this would be the first I've heard of it.
  The (true) accusation that gets thrown around a lot is that banks will short-sell shares without first borrowing them, theoretically allowing for a situation in which more shares are shortsold than actually exist.  The idea is that banks are supposed to locate and borrow the shares within a day or two of shorting them, but they're often deliberately sloppy about it.  We're still talking about a pretty small effect though.  
@_date: 2016-05-31 15:55:07
**You make a ton of basic mistakes here:**
1. Bitcoin must be purchased through an intermediary exactly the same way gold and silver must be.  You can't buy bitcoin on the bitcoin network because the bitcoin network doesn't handle fiat.  To *buy* bitcoin, you have to convert fiat (or something else) into bitcoin; most people do this through an exchange, or a company like Circle or Coinbase, or it can be done person to person.  Exactly the same as gold.
2.  The logic of "if only Americans want to own it" applies to every penny stock, every commodity, to pokemon, to pogs, etc.  It's meaningless.  By this logic, rare pogs might soon be worth $1 million a bottle.
3.  With most investments, when you buy it, you receive the raw thing itself.  This is true for equity, bonds, gold coins, and most collectibles.
4.  People often make the mistake in thinking things have binary outcomes when they do not.  The most likely outcome for bitcoin imo is that it will basically stay what it is - a useful tool for darknet markets, evading capital controls, and storing some wealth outside the reach of the government.  It's popularity in this role could increase substantially causing 1 BTC = $10,000, or maybe it will instead remain stagnant as it did over the last 2 years.

What on earth are you talking about?  I can transfer fiat or gold or collectibles without a third party.  In fact, most of the time when I go to the store I do exactly that.  I hand the store owner cash and he hands me a pepsi.  We just transferred fiat with no intermediary.  I can hand someone a gold coin or a work of art...no intermediary needed.

The NSA can easily see through TOR, it just takes them a bit of time.  They control a decent percentage of the exit nodes (at least 4 are literally located in an NSA building in Washington DC).  Let's say a TOR transmission goes through 6 nodes globally.  The NSA just has to visit and inspect all 6 of the servers.  That's a major burden and not something they can do for every transmission, but they can do it for the important ones.  And of course if they control 2 of the 6 nodes, that makes it much easier.

Absolutely.  The question is, to what extent is the irrationality systemic and biased in a particular direction, and therefore predictable and exploitable.  Most market professionals currently believe that, mostly, the biases and mistakes the market makes cannot be systematically exploited; rather they require someone to identify case by case what the mistake is.  There *are* a few exceptions - for example, it seems like implied volatility is systematically overpriced by the market for psychological reasons.

@_date: 2016-07-29 15:08:31
It seems like you don't understand how blockchains work.  As with *all* blockchains, code determines the outcome *unless* there is a hard fork.  In all of the major blockchains (bitcoin, ethereum, dash, litecoin etc) literally anyone can initiate a hard fork; the winning fork is determined by game theory.  Most of the direct power resides with miners and economically important nodes (mostly exchanges for ethereum, also some big businesses for bitcoin).
Think about it like this: you're working for a company and the company signs you to a 3 year contract that guarantees you $100k a year.  You know the company is obliged by the contract but you also know there are things outside the contract that could prevent payment, like the company going out of business or you dying.

Eh, I don't think that's a fair description.  It's like saying that bitcoin full nodes are basically semi-centralized servers that can be easily Sybil attacked or spied on.  It's just a question of 1. How many nodes / masternodes exist, and 2. How distributed are they geographically and in terms of who owns them.  
DASH has ~3800 masternodes, securing about a $50 million market cap, compared to bitcoin's ~5700 full nodes securing a $10.7 billion market cap.  Based on this, DASH is *much* more secure for the simple reason that they actually incentivize people to run nodes.  With that said, I've heard people say that a substantial number of DASH masternodes are owned by a few rich people, so the advantage is probably not as big as it looks.

Then you might as well compare a bitcoin HF to going skydiving.  The *reason* and *complexity* for a HF completely change the scenario.  Heck, bitcoin wouldn't exist today if it hadn't been hard forked in response to the big bug in 2010.

Sure.  Complexity can be used productively or destructively.  
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:11:08
The issue is mostly one of unit size.  Let's assume that it takes 10 minutes worth of ethereum confirms to be equally secure to one bitcoin confirmation.  
How scared of a doublespend attack are we when buying a cup of coffee?  Or buying a $60 sweater?  Or buying a $600 computer?  Or even a $5,000 car?  In each of these cases, what tradeoff between security and time would we want?
For many use cases, you'd be fine with the equivalent of 1 or 2 or 3 ethereum confirmations.  But with bitcoin you don't have that option.  You either go with a very risky 0-confirm transaction, or you have to wait a whole 10 (or sometimes 50) minutes.

At the moment, bitcoin is only a store of value, not really money.  Very few people use bitcoin as money, because it's not very good at it.  10 minute (sometimes one hour) waits to spend my money, a $.07 fee that's 10%+ for small transactions, a very poor UX interface for purchases etc etc.  Consumers haven't adopted bitcoin because for money, cash or credit cards are better/faster/cheaper and the latter even has fraud protection.  Of course, things like the LN might eventually change that so that bitcoin actually starts getting used like money.

@_date: 2016-07-28 17:11:56
I'll admit, I'm not that knowledgeable on the technology underpinning confirmations and the security that entails.  My understanding is that 0-confirm transaction is relatively easy to doublespend and doesn't require an actual "doublespend attack" to do so.  Someone can simply send multiple separate spends of the same BTC.  In contrast, to doublespend a confirmed transaction requires an actual doublespend attack with the requisite hashpower.  
@_date: 2016-07-05 03:46:44

You're drastically exaggerating the difficulty.  Standard business contracts are often 30 pages long and teams of lawyers spend many hours carefully crafting them.  Sure, we might need some smart lawyers and engineers to spend a few hours carefully considering how to best define the winning chain contractually.  But once you figure out a good way to do it, it's boilerplate and every future contract just uses the same language.
It's "complicated" in the sense that you or I might do a bad job of it.  It's very very simple compared to many common business contracts.

You're weirdly emotional about this.  It's not about "glorifying" or whatever.

A large chunk of developers, miners, whales, etc etc. So certainly there is pressure from a large chunk of the community for a bailout.  Second, the funds in the DAO were specifically meant to be invested in ethereum projects that would generate growth and development in ethereum.  Calling this "corrupt" is simply inaccurate.  All blockchains have this consensus process built in to them - bitcoin included.

Core has no plan to decrease centralization.  They're just going to great lengths to avoid a trivially small increase (6k to 4.5k nodes).  Our only hope to *increase decentralization* is for a substantial increase in adoption, particularly the birth of more companies, since companies tend to run full nodes.
@_date: 2016-07-07 14:31:26
Did you seriously just try to counter a general statement with a single anecdote?  
A full node gives whoever is running it greater confidence that transactions are legit.  Most companies run full nodes.  Very few users run full nodes.
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:29:41
Seems like you misunderstood what ethereum stood for.  I understood it to be a platform for dApps and smart contracts; I don't think it was ever meant as a vehicle for massive theft where the winner is determined by whoever is cleverest at exploiting software bugs.  
As I'm sure you know, all blockchains are mutable as determined by nodes and miners.  Game theory makes it clear that nodes and miners will try to act in their own interest.  There's no morality or "mockery" about it - just simple game theory.
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:18:40
I understand your argument but think the distinction between contentious and non-contentious HFs is kind of irrelevant.  From a legal perspective, there isn't much of a difference between a secondary chain with 49% hashpower or 0.01% hashpower.  To prevent confusion in both cases, all contracts would simply have a simple and clear metric to determine the "real" chain.
It wouldn't be a "huge mess" at all - it's a far simpler problem than what business contracts often have to tackle.  Defining the living chain is far easier, for example, than defining circumstances of force majeure.

Stupid people investing in a poorly written smart contract.  Similar to people losing money in Gox.  Not a fault of the cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2016-07-29 18:57:06
Also, it seems like you don't know what "decentralized"  The HF that happened to reverse a faulty smart contract outcome was exactly the decentralized process that defines all successful public blockchains.  People didn't get their money back because they complained.  They got their money back because the decentralized special interest groups that can produce winning chains in a HF decided to do so out of self-interest.
A more interesting question is why bitcoin hasn't had a successful HF, despite the majority of miners and node operators calling for one.  It suggests that bitcoin has become centralized such that a powerful minority interest can determine the outcome.
@_date: 2016-07-07 15:28:21
You're misunderstanding *relative* versus *absolute.*  My claim is that, as a percentage, more businesses run full nodes than users.  I never claimed that *most* or even *many* businesses run full nodes.  Simply that if you have 100 businesses and 100 users, more businesses will be running full nodes than users.
@_date: 2016-07-05 00:40:39
Lol.  Take an econ 101 class.  They'll all teach you the definition of money.  By your definition, beanie babies are money.  
And yes...bitcoin *can* be used for all 3, it simply isn't.  Beanie babies *can* be used for all 3 too.  But it's not either.
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:54:59
I'm not familiar with the current state of CoinJoin implementations.  Are there any for bitcoin that require no trust of a centralized third party?  
@_date: 2016-07-04 20:08:14
I agree.  The question being debated is what defines that integrity.
Consider this - most bitcoin community members are in favor of the current bitcoin core roadmap which will produce a hard fork in the middle of next year.  This hard fork will be opposed by some people, but will presumably have overwhelming consensus.  Most of us do not believe it will undermine the integrity of bitcoin.  Why not?  Why won't this HF undermine the integrity?  Because we see the ability to hard fork for some reasons as a *feature*, and we think HF'ing to improve the architecture of the network is a valid reason.
Similarly, many ethereum community members believe that a hard fork that has consensus support from all interest groups (users, miners, developers, companies, etc), and is intended to correct an obvious exploit in the code does not undermine the integrity.  In fact, some think it *increases* the integrity of the platform by establishing that blatant theft will not be rewarded when the community has built-in consensus mechanisms to prevent it.

Who else has done more?
Coinbase as been *the* avenue into bitcoin for more than a million bitcoin users.  
@_date: 2016-07-28 19:36:39
You realize that the majority of bitcoin core support the same HF as Brian right?  Heck, Adam Back was advocating a 2-4-8 HF solution a year ago.  The only debate is over timing.
I'll say it again - by providing a trust, legal, easy way for US consumers to purchase bitcoin, Armstrong has created more than a million bitcoin holders, dramatically increased the value of the BTC token, and helped legitimize bitcoin to the world by making purchases via a regulated and insured US entity easy.

Huh?  People pay for electricity.  
@_date: 2016-07-29 18:55:30
Your framing suggests you still just don't get how blockchains work.
A blockchain is not a person, it doesn't have "rationale."  Rather, a HF is decided by a variety of competing special interest groups.  Each group's motive is to maximize their own self-interest.  If bitcoin's miners and most important node operators (exchanges, Coinbase, and Circle) thought they could HF this instant and profit, bitcoin would be hard forking as we speak.
@_date: 2016-07-22 19:24:30
Are you confusing the failure of a single smart contract with the crypto itself?  That's like confusing Gox for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-28 20:37:19
Oh man, you're in for a rude awakening.  It seems you don't understand that the value of cryptocurrencies comes entirely from "network effect", and that blockchain immutability and security comes only from game theory as it applies to the decisions of miners and economically important nodes.  
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:49:47
Most of the innovation happening in the crypto space is in ethereum imo.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:13:01
Coinbase is one of the better bitcoin companies I've dealt with.  Their perception of bad customer service is just "availability bias."  They have more customers than anyone else, so they also have more customers who come on reddit to complain, than anyone else.
@_date: 2016-07-05 03:39:14
I stand corrected.  This is the first time I've seen anyone disagree with the characterization that it was a theft.  Are you pro-HF?  
@_date: 2016-07-28 14:56:29
Funny how many people haven't learned the lesson that when it comes to tech, if you don't move fast and break things you become obsolete and die.  Better to be buggy facebook than a dead friendster.

Definitely completely bullshit, but things are overpriced about as often as they're underpriced imo.  In other words, the idea that future expectations are factored in as a good and relatively unbiased starting point for analysis.  Then the question becomes - how are those expectations wrong, or why might they not be priced in, this time?

If you actually read his comment, you wouldn't respond "wtf??"  It's pretty simple to understand.

As a for-profit company with many VC investors expecting substantial returns, how do you balance your commitment to the bitcoin ecosystem with your commitment to Blockstream's investors?
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:22:13
Bitcoin is in beta.  It is not "critical."  People don't live or die because of it.  It's only major uses today are darknet drug purchases and embezzlement.  But we both agree it has amazing potential.  It's bizarre to me that people try to treat bitcoin as a mature technology or product.  Bitcoin is used by a negligible number of humans today.  It's basically irrelevant.  But it can become so much more if we let it grow.  Focusing on protecting what it has would be like if Zuckerberg focused on platform stability when Facebook had 2000 users.
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:49:23
"reserving the right" to do something isn't even vaguely similar to doing it.  Blockstream's "pledge" is just words on a website.
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:27:29
Surely you're kidding?  Until developers produce, test, and disseminate the software, miners can't install it.  Using your logic, 0% of the bitcoin community supported Segregated Witness 6 months ago.

To the broader community, that's a straw man.  Yes, some people hold that view, but very few.

Are you seriously comparing the ETH hardfork that transferred assets, to a bitcoin HF for a routine scaling upgrade?
You're aware that Satoshi planned to have periodic HFs for scaling, right?
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:54:36
Weird strawman arguments.  If you find this kind of thing convincing at all, you should seriously question your own biases.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:58:27
Fortunately not, or bitcoin would be horribly insecure.  70% of hash power is currently concentrated in a single country, controlled by a few people.  Miners prevent double spends.  Nodes prevent censorship and  the shutting down of the network.

Bitcoin couldn't HF after Gox.  With Gox, there was no clear source and destination address of stolen funds.  Also, a lot of the money wasn't literally stolen, rather Gox bought BTC with fake fiat.  Impossible to HF to fix that.
Bitcoin did HF in its first year to upgrade its code though.  All blockchains can be hardforked.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:17:06
I'm not a fan of the proposed HF, but let's be honest - there's nothing corrupt about it.  Total unambiguous theft, and the community may choose to make use of the option available in all blockchains, to HF with community consensus.  I certainly agree that to HF now may make an actual corrupt HF more likely in the future, but both bitcoin and ethereum always had and will always have this option to them by virtue of how blockchains work.  As for tragic flaws - ethereum is in alpha mode as far as I'm concerned.  They'll probably totally replace Solidity as the programming language for the EVM.  It's not much different to me than where bitcoin was when a few billion bitcoins were created out of thin air in 2010.
