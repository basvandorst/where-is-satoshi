you don't have to select a number. ~21m of coins is actually based on decreased number of coins reward after certain number of blocks. I.e. if we drop automatic decrease of reward - number of coins will be unlimited.

you got a car. this is public info. irs will want explanation and neighbors will see it parked at your house.

I already tried to figure out from snapcard directly, but could not get clear answer. What is benefit of using their service vs. sending bitcoins to bitstamp, sell them and send wire back to bank account and pay with these money for car?
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:06:25
Do you suggest that this is a way to put tax payments burden on snapcard or totally avoid it? I highly doubt it. Former is non-viable for snapcard, later is plain illegal.

First of all, as it is right now it can't be infinitely divided. only to 0.00000001. 
Second, my question was about why it is 21m, not how to get around this fixed number.

Thank you guys for great feedback! After discussing it here, in and in the IRC chat I see I am completely wrong. So I spent last day implementing rake back system... I have rolled back to 1% rake and now you can earn as much as 120% rake back points! Separate post will follow up on details.

Please, loosers like you can't scratch their butt themselves, they ask their mom to do it since they are afraid of doing it.
Clients of my project did NOT lost a bitcent in this issue, dumbass.

First of all AGPL is quite enforceable. Although, I do not believe someone really can benefit from this small project. If they decide to built commercial application with similar functions, it is pretty easy to build from scratch to get around it.
Why AGPL? Because it is true GPL license for today's state of web software development. And I expect it to be accepted very well, since the whole idea of bitcoin is totally open source related.
Also, I do not believe someone really will have any problems with it :) If you believe AGPL license really hurts this project, could you please bring case study where AGPL prevents use of this project?
@_date: 2011-09-03 04:38:01
Well. This experiment was worth it. All three issues were closed with in one week! And I was really surprised with code quality. I plan to post more bounties like this for sure! 
Building great open source product and involving people into open source bitcoin economy - best of two worlds! =)

How degraded this community... (sigh)
I had two cases where my project had flaws. One in December 2010 and one in April 2011.
In December guy withdraw everything from project through this flaw in order others could not do it, contacted me and returned all money to safe location..
In April some hacker hacked project and despite writing email that he is going to return money and this should be lesson for me, disappeared.
Today - person openly confirm he stole money and not going to return em.. And most ridiculous part - there are many who support it! Stupid people...
Personally, I returned a lot of wrong sent coins due different bugs and mistypes. And I will do this in future.

do not worry - address stored in wallet.dat and you will be able to receive all transactions to this address. 
it is good idea to generate new address for each transaction and this is what default client do for you.

Check out chrisrico link - he uploaded article to ubitio.us - there you can pay for it with bitcoins

Thank you to someone who notified me about this by email. Problem lies in underlying S3 library. I created patch for it a while ago and submitted to maintainer -  , but it still did not get into packages. Recently I moved to new dedicated server and of course forgot to patch this module. This is fixed. You should be able to download files now without any problems. (no need to pay again as long as you did not clear cookies)

Just sit at table with 30 seconds timeout. And if there are bots - please report to my email.
@_date: 2011-09-06 21:44:01
email me with details how your server is configured. i was working on implementing the whole stack more efficiently last week and got pretty good results.
@_date: 2011-09-05 16:41:10
This called responsibility - ability to cover expenses if you messed up and do not mess up your clients business. This is good thing.
You are right - I do not know you. Only thing I can judge you based on - are your advises. If you do not want to look like a looser, do not act like a looser. 
Instead support people attempting to add value to community, create something...
...or build thing yourself. Just make sure you have reserves for errors. And believe me, errors _always_ happens. Key here - execute business slow in controllable manner, not like a bubble.

thanx. i really want to find out if i should invest (or waste?!) time on implementing rakeback feature? It seems to me wasted, since it do not really benefit anyone.
But probably 99%+ online rooms do that. And I am kinda confused there why people prefer it?

Here, at  I do not "invest" players money, do not try to play with them at mtgox/th/bitcoinica/etc sites. They even do not sit on the server where poker software installed. Money sits at my own computer, on separate user account home folder with home folder encryption. Only encrypted folder get backed up to raid-1 external drive and Ubuntu one. (i.e. no clear text version of files ever see raid-1 external drive or Ubuntu One)
Even more - I keep two separate user accounts - one with larger stash of users deposits, which I rarely have to open (due this effect that new deposits often pays for new withdrawal) and smallish account where I keep enough funds for current operations. 
So at every step risk is getting lower with amount getting higher:
- On the server, if hacker will ever get into it, he will get only few bitcoins.
- On my home computer, if some trojan will get into it, it will get only few tens of bitcoins used for current operation.
- Since getting into my home computer highly unlikely - I do not think trojan ever will get to another user account, which is logged out (read no clear text files available to the system) most of the time. But even in this case - I am as a huge bitcoin fan accumulated several times more bitcoins then what betco.in have in deposits and these coins stored on the separate user account on separate computer =)
And my site was online for more then a year, fully open source and transparent. 
I agree, getting some credibility in such environment will be hard, but I totally trying to get there. Key here - transparency.

May be you should not give an advice like this? It so laughing when people who did nothing in their whole life advising others to not do things...
I DID lost money of other players. And I DID payed it off. And if it will happen today - I will pay it off. This called responsibility. And people like you afraid of responsibility and give advises to not do things because can not be responsible for actions they are doing.
All this been said - responsible or not guy who sent 511 BTC in error, thief who openly confirmed he stole money should not do that. 
Why I so disappointed - this project (bitcoin) started very nice - people doing business in very open manner... And then when price of btc kicked up - bunch of scumbags appeared... And bunch of very "clever" guys giving advises to not do things... 
People like you and people like this thief who stole 511 BTC is a reason why we still need government. Because people like this can't live without it... =( This if why I so disappointed. I really hoped this project will be geeky enough to not dumb people let in...

I would just add new tab(s) to bitcoin-qt UI where you can purchase and renew domains. Probably with some nice UI for dns record management.

I consider myself pretty good programmer. I do not consider myself good poker player, since I mostly loose against good players, but still I love poker.

@_date: 2011-09-02 18:35:19
Hm. Why there are downvotes? Is there something wrong with idea or it is just bots?
@_date: 2011-11-25 09:15:08
I want people use my code, that's why I am giving it to community. I just do not want people take it and never give back. 
If you want to keep new developments with yourself and not give back, that's totally fair and might be required in some cases. In these cases just buy proprietary license. It is so simple!
