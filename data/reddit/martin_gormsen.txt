7 transactions per second is the max with segwit. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:20:14
7 transactions per second thats all. Maybe the Bitcoin core developers will increase the blocksize to 2 MB if the fees becomes to high in the next bull run.  The lightning network can handle thousand of transactions per second making Bitcoin a medium of exchange, while Bitcoin in its purest form is digital gold and a store of value.

In Denmark you only pay taxes when you sell your Bitcoins for fiat. I use my Bitcoin to pay for food, stuff, fly tickets and much more. So this is tax free for me��

@_date: 2018-12-05 20:51:23
45,73% er korrekt. Men ved Bitcoin betaler du højere skat da du ikke bidrager med arbejdsmarkedsbidrag så 53 procent. Over 498.000kr er lig med topskat 65 % ��
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:44:31
If we crash, I will buy some more. If we bounce I will be happy��

@_date: 2018-12-05 14:42:04
20 percent�� rest is in stocks.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:39:23
Right now its a loss for most if us. But yes, when we finally get some profit and sell for fiat the taxation is between 53 and 65% to avoid that, you can buy a prepaid crypto card or do like I do, spend your Bitcoins for real world use. ��
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:52:18
Same. You pay high taxes. Best thing to do is buying a prepaid card. Taxes above 30% is modern slavery. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 09:55:47
They use coinify��
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:57:22
Yes 53% - 65% in tax.
