Oh I'm so glad that I bought a week ago during 'the dip'......
Anyone know where I can buy some patience?

The link is to a thread discussing the price of BTC hitting $1M and one that I actually referred to in my OP.
This replacement is the polar opposite i.e $0, which is why I reposted but with an amended heading.

I've never seen this before - how does such a scam benefit the scammer?

It must be wonderful to be born a millionaire and possess unbounded knowledge from the outset. How DARE everybody else lag behind you!
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:16:32
Yeah I did that........but it carried on!
@_date: 2019-11-19 07:46:07
Why? Isn't it simply an observation? How has it upset you?
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:41:48
Damn fine words dude!! Just wish I'd seen what the little shit had written before he wiped it.....

Good comeback! Maybe you're not as much of an asshole as I originally thought....
@_date: 2019-11-14 11:56:43
Well I'm sure you expected a shit-load of negativity from the 'experts' with a fucking ton of life experience, a perfect nuclear family set up and a couple of million dollars in the bank from hard graft telling you that you're an asshole......and you got it! Bollocks to 'em all.
Dude, you're in an enviable position and smart with it, so go Live Your Dream!

Because there are people outside of your particular society that are actually pleased for others.

It's times like this when spare cash seems to be at its scarcest, just when I need it :o)
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:44:29
I don't recall saying it was?
@_date: 2019-11-12 16:26:05
I'm happy to pay for the bandwidth....

Some people on here must have a deep-seated hatred of others, and consider them so lowly. Why?
What benefit is there to anyone in knocking them down (other than feeding your self-inflated ego)? Are you that unhappy with your lot in life? Were you bullied at school or beaten by your parents? Are you generally envious of everybody else? For fucks sake, can't you be happy for somebody that's evidently pleased with what they've achieved? 
If you absolutely need to include venom in your posts then maybe you should go talk to a medical professional who could help you understand your issues?

If only I had a tenth of a Bitcoin for every time I've read that....
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:45:49
If only I had a coin for every time somebody's attempted originality with that line....

I didn't know either, try this:

Got it, thanks!

"A loan". 
Substitute "I was born into extreme wealth and therefore consider that I'm privileged enough to criticise others".
@_date: 2019-10-21 15:01:07
Fucking hell, so much hate here towards somebody trying to do a little good. 
It must be wonderful to be born so fucking perfect and knowledgeable about absolutely everything. You lucky, lucky bastards.....

Whoever made this deserves a beer!
@_date: 2019-10-28 12:15:55
Feelgood post!

I had the same thought but when you eventually cash out either all or part of your e.g BTC, then the money will end up in a bank account somewhere?
Not declaring it now COULD open a can of worms if your bank account suddenly gets a huge $/£ injection.

Dude, try r/angry and stop being an ass.
