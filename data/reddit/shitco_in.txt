It fits ;) More content will be added obviously, but this is a good start. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 19:39:09
Looks like they need some new domains for this service. Thankfully, we have some for sale - 
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:27:31
What about answering some of the important questions the community has, instead of re-hashing the same shit that anyone can read on Wikipedia:
1. Can you show us your cold storage wallet and proof of BTC(XBT) reserves?
2. Do you have an English speaking lawyer that is interfacing with US authorities, to ensure that OKC is in compliance with US regulations?
3. Can you please outline your corporate structure for the community.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:58:36
LOL :D

If you haven't seen it yet, we wrote this the other day about the subject - 
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:16:42
Check out something we have been putting together: 
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:13:59
There is one for fiat too - 
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:16:16
Thank you for the kind words. We don't believe that people having their money stolen represents the "death" of a fiat, it is a different situation. We are planing on only focusing on the actual death of fiat money as we know it. Thank you for the input and suggestions though, if you have any others, or any stories of fiat dying, feel free to e-mail us.

It may be the first B2B transaction involving bitcoin, originating from a publicly owned company. (Bitpay did pay ESPN in BTC, but that transaction was the opposite direction, so the public company was receiving).
We have some domain's for sale, would be great to get a 150 btc for a few of them. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 18:46:15
Part 2 of our coverage is here - 
@_date: 2015-05-23 14:37:50
We would consider leasing it to them, for $10,000 a month. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 12:27:12
It's satire, we are Bitcoin bulls. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 01:14:48
It is our belief that it is a fairly safe bet to say Satoshi never destroyed his private keys for the original mining wallets. If those coins were meant to be destroyed, they would be sent to a 1BitcoinEater(esque) wallet. The coins won't move for quite a bit of time, once Bitcoin begins to reach it's full potential. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 01:37:57
Let's call it an educated guess :) 
@_date: 2015-05-26 04:03:00
Thank you for the input. Our goal is to keep the community informed as much as possible. If we reach just 1 more reader that was unaware of the situation, our goal is accomplished. Did you actually lol? If you did, we have completed our mission. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 15:20:06
It is our belief that the coins won't move until the appropriate time, when Bitcoin has been deemed a success. They won't even be moved to a multi-sig wallet, as leaving them in their original location is a testament to Bitcoin's security. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:10:13
Haha, well that was our first thought... but didn't want to throw off any BTC newbies :) 
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:35:00
Coming up shortly, will post here on Reddit when it's done. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 02:09:17
Thanks for the suggestion, we just use the Reddit suggested titles. We will consider deleting that portion in the future. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:45:12
The fact that a company would try to use that against an individual on their official company blog should be a MAJOR red flag. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:49:32
We are providing some coverage as well - 
Will be adding new evidence as it is uncovered.

Second update regarding the situation - 
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:29:25
Wouldn't that be irony, with Roger an investor (one of the first) in Blockchain.info and the bitcoin.com domain re-directing there now. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:00:21
Ps: We did not down vote you, actually we up voted this post because we feel that a discussion is better than no action at all. We also noticed that our posts regarding OKC were HEAVILY down voted today, so it would appear as if someone is trying to blanket suppress all posts related to OKC. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 01:02:48
OKC is sketchy as fuck, read all about it - 
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:05:38
They are short and to the point, but for those with ADD here is the abridged version with some light commentary - 
Thanks Roger for putting this together for us, you are doing a great service to the community. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:42:31
It appears so. At least we did our due diligence and produced material for prospective new customers (posted it earlier in this thread - don't want to spam). 
@_date: 2015-05-15 00:22:16
It is outlined by in the post. He is a notorious member from BTCs earlier days (mostly the BTC-e troll box and his "huge LTC position"). 
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:40:03
Thank you for these e-mails. We will be updating our coverage accordingly. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 00:19:32
How does Satoshi control the economy by having 1 million coins in wallets which have never moved? If anything, it makes all of our coins worth more for the time being (knowing his aren't moving for a long time). 
The "cornering" of markets happens regularly, the most recent possible attempt here - 
Thanks to Satoshi's genius creation, the Blockchain allows us to track his/their BTC in real time! Something that would never/couldn't happen in the existing financial world. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 02:01:42
Thank you for the kind words :) Make sure to stay tuned, our mission is to deliver great content to the community. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:10:48
We reported on this earlier today -   (it's near the end). 
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:49:42
Our take is here - 
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:43:42
Additional information has been added to the article regarding OKC's lawyer and the letter that he wrote. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:57:59
We can tell you from experience, doing considerable amounts of business with the Chinese, that this is not always the case. There are plenty of situations similar to the ones that you described, but when dealing with legitimate businesses and businessmen, this is never the case. OKC, being a "leader" in the bitcoin space, and essentially a financial institution, should not be involved in any "fluid" business dealings. Any financial institution that does not do business "straight", does not, in our opinion, have the credibility to hold our money. If Roger was buying plastic trinkets off of Alibaba, the situation would be considerably different (as you described). Unfortunately, for OKC, that is not the case. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 12:32:49
Agreed, that's why we wrote it the way we did :D 
@_date: 2015-05-23 18:45:13
For anyone that wants a summary - 
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:44:44
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:32:39
Our take on the situation - 
We used a video of the South Park scene at the end, so thought it was fitting to share. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:42:51
Read the article, the government recognizes Ripple as pre-mined aka Ripple Labs Inc. is Ripple. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:01:06
Thank you for the credit :D
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:16:43
Agreed 100%, I don't think we'll ever know. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 04:11:31
That was the point... 
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:04:08
Also, here is our Reddit post in case anyone wants to make comments/has questions on the article. OKC troll down votes are out in full force today. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:58:03
Post has been updated to include some additional information. This includes confirmation of some of the accusations by a former OKC employee. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 02:15:25
Lol I get that all the time and I am not. I have been around almost as long as that Goat, but mostly as a lurker... have had this nick for years before Reddit though. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:47:27
Thanks :) 
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:41:35
We wrote a great piece on this as well - 
@_date: 2015-05-23 05:12:48
More coverage here - 
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:23:29
We appreciate the input and will take it into consideration for the future. Obviously, a site must be monetized in some way. We thought this was less intrusive than plastering ads everywhere, and at the same time, offering bit coiners a place to trade that we deem safer than the others (there is risk involved with any exchange). If you have any other suggestions for us, feel free to reach out. 
If we collected enough tips via the address at the bottom of our page, we would consider removing all types of monetization. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:42:33
It is a nickname. I'm pretty sure it has purely satirical meaning and no connection to anything religious. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:00:34
The key part of that is - "just one point in time". What does that mean? CZ states that certain accounts were left out... could it be possible that BTC was also sent in to "cook the books"? We aren't making any accusations, but just theorizing different possibilities. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 15:36:26
Agreed. Put your coins in cold storage and wait the storm out. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 18:45:50
Here you go - 
@_date: 2015-05-29 04:54:34
We would love to portray OKC in a good light, as we feel bitcoin needs as much positivity as possible. Unfortunately, the only claim that has been cleared up here is that Star, himself, appears to not have forged the document in question. The document itself is still a forgery, and came from OKC (the company/brand). The opportunity presented itself for this to be cleared up by just paying Roger the past due balance (this is outlined in the e-mails). Instead, money was put up as a bounty, and a court may still find OKC legally liable for paying Roger too. The other three things you mentioned (liar, fraudster and insolvent) have been mentioned MANY times, by many other people than Roger. To this day, OKC has not given evidence that they are not any of these. We would love for them to come forward with evidence so that traders can be more comfortable using their product. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 14:40:51
It's China, so unlikely anyone will go to jail. It will be more interesting to see if Draper takes any action (he is invested in OKC). 
@_date: 2015-05-16 01:13:17
Satoshi's coins won't move until there is no need to "cash them out" for fiat. Like you said, this is a global currency, so let's worry about them moving when Bitcoin is actually used to facilitate global trade. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:38:57
We apologize if it came off that way. In order to be as transparent as possible, we made it clear that it is a referral link. What unfounded facts? Spend some time on TV and you will speak to many traders who are exploring other markets via this avenue in order to take advantage of their volatility on days when Bitcoin is relatively stable. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:23:38
Done, do you want us to link it to your post here to give you credit? 
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:42:04
Thanks! Let us know if there is anything specific you would like to see. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 05:08:09
You can always lease it to OK Coin for $10,000 USD per month :D
@_date: 2015-05-13 03:17:39
Sorry if it was taken out of context, it was meant to be a hyperbole. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:31:07
Satirical, but fitting :D Hope you are a regular reader. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 14:47:00
Interesting. I will re-read their prospectus. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 01:20:27

@_date: 2015-08-20 06:42:11
We apologize if it came of as us unwelcoming the test. Our point is that it clearly was an attack, which obviously is a type of test. The point of the blog, if you haven't noticed, is to present factual news to the community with a touch of humor. Sorry if this offended you. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:35:01
That is a concern moving forward. Thank you for using your brain and thinking a bit more into the issue. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:36:11
This is excellent information that we were unaware of. Thank you for this. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 04:21:40
What else would you like us to explain? do you have any questions? 
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:53:34
Interesting, thank you!
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:34:36
We will follow up with a phone call to the number tomorrow in order to verify, if that is what readers would prefer. Much more time was dedicated to this post than had originally been allotted, and there are 2-3 other incomplete sections which we may release as an add on. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 01:29:31
Why not cover something the MSM has decided to neglect until now - 
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:33:21
We never said that we don't welcome tests, and have the same belief that bitcoin has to be bulletproof in order to succeed. What we saw though, was a bit more than a test.
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:48:12
We are not anti XT actually, at all. What we are anti, is the community as a whole receiving snippets of information here and there, and not critically thinking through anything. The fact that this piece has raised the debate and discussion that it has, and caused the community as a whole to do further research, means that we have done our job. 
What we want is what is best for the community. We want bitcoin to succeed, but not through what seems like an extortion attempt via Coinwallet. We don't think that's what Satoshi had in mind when he started the project. 
Our statements at the end say that we do not see anything nefarious as of now, but this raises further questions. How does that make things seem dangerous? 
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:00:37
Lies? We are simply reporting on a series of events, all links and sources are provided in our article. We have also responded to the criticisms, so please read our post history and feel free to ask if you have any further questions. Also, if you notice, we took a balanced stance when writing the article and both sides of the argument were presented. It's the questions that were raised that are most concerning. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:52:24
We predicted this price rise a few days ago: 
@_date: 2015-08-10 05:44:08
Thank you for the prompt and detailed response. As we stated earlier, your community outreach has been nothing less than great (especially compared to other exchanges). While we disagree with your changes in fee schedule, the reason was made clearer after the NY state announcement was posted. 
We do still feel though, that some technical improvements need to be made on the end of BFX. It would have been easier to accept the fee increases if the announcement was something along the lines of - "We have implemented xxx new trading engine which is performing flawlessly. Moving forward, we will be banning NYS residents, etc, and have incurred a large cost due to the upgrade. The fee schedule will be changing moving forward to reflect these ever changing variables.". Some value needs to be added for traders in our opinion. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:57:37
We are aware of that, and have addressed the criticisms in some of our responses. Please check our post history if you would like more information. 
Some below:
The "slippery slope" is exactly how the code modifications are taken advantage of. For example, it would be quite easy for a malicious player to "blacklist" every Tor exit node (as Mike noted), therefor forcing all bitcoin transactions to be performed on the clear net. This, in itself, is a completely reasonable worry for anyone who may be concerned with privacy.
We had a few additions (this was one of them) to the article, but it was already lengthy enough. If there is enough feedback, we will continue with a part two that outlines these additional thoughts.
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:25:19
Some thoughts from other coders, worth the read - 
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:13:43
Google: Trojan is a brand name of condoms and sexual lubricants manufactured by the Church &amp; Dwight Company. 70.5 percent of condoms purchased in United States drugstores are Trojan brand.
XT is going to protect us from spam attacks and DDOS via Tor, duh :) 
Perhaps we weren't taking the term so literally, we never specified that there was anything malicious about XT. In fact, we said otherwise. What we were referring to with the usage of the word "trojan" is the malicious attempts by some players (say, Coinwallet, as we outlined) to push an upgrade to XT when there are still unanswered questions. Only a fraction of the article focuses on XT itself, the majority discusses other events surrounding the block size debate. We thought it would be clear to readers that the usage of the word trojan refers to the situation, not the software itself. We clearly state in the article that there does not seem to be anything malicious about the code.
Our biggest question: What is the bigger agenda at play here? (on a macro level)
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:25:38
Check out some other coders thoughts too, for a balanced view - 
@_date: 2015-08-29 23:12:47
They have an interesting history - 
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:19:59
There is no hidden agenda, so it is not propaganda. We simply laid out the facts and events that have occurred, and are leaving any conclusions for the reader to form. What is misleading about the article? All sides of all arguments were shown, and all sources were provided. 
Our goal is to provide the community with thought provoking content, in areas which ALL of the current bitcoin media do not cover. So far, the feedback has been nothing short of excellent. If you prefer not to enjoy our content, feel free to switch back to the programming that your masters provide. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 21:55:57
We covered this a few weeks ago - 
@_date: 2015-08-29 23:07:14
This is such a shitty article that we felt the need to take precious time out of our busy lives in order to comment on that fact. What's up with people completely uneducated on bitcoin/crypto currency trying to sound smart lately?
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:45:01
It is a direct quote from Coinwallet that they are pro XT. 
“The fact that the XT fork hasn’t occurred yet is ridiculous,” CoinWallet said.
How much easier can it be to conclude than that? 
Regarding creating a market for fees, those are thoughts which we had started including in the blog post (along with 1-2 other items), but it had become sizable in length so we decided to save those for another day. 
Please provide any other feedback, we would be happy to respond. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 21:42:58
We'll be back soon :) 
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:46:32
We outlined some opportunities in the article. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 18:13:13
We appreciate your thoughts and input. Not all community members share your sentiment though. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 00:29:07
You should research a bit more into everything before making judgement, your thoughts are a bit off. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:18:32
The reference was to those people who bring the monitor in when the CPU is "broken", thinking that the monitor is the computer. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 11:48:19
If they do not make changes, we fully agree that they will go under. 
With proper planning and execution, our belief is that ChangeTip is in a position to change how society as a whole uses the internet. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 00:32:18
That already happened... 
@_date: 2015-09-04 11:47:06
Some info there you might find interesting. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:41:33
As we said, we e-mailed them about "opportunities" aka: to help them.
@_date: 2015-09-03 00:31:39
Agreed regarding Reddit being a platform, and ChangeTip piggybacking that platform (and all other instances). The main issue here is that we have essentially created a business plan to ensure the long term viability of ChangeTip, presented it directly to them, and they chose another route (which clearly isn't working). 
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:30:35
More money into the system = more money into bitcoin. Sure, sending friends $100 is easy with ChangeTip, but there are plenty of other competitors in this space (remittances are being touted as one of bitcoin's largest potential growth areas). Why compete with these companies when ChangeTip has already created something completely different, which has been proven to work? Why not upgrade and update this current model? For more money to move into ChangeTip, normal people need to realize it's potential. Once the general public is hooked, more money will move into bitcoin and then into ChangeTip. 
Our opinion is that the fire has already been lit, but is now just some embers waiting for additional logs to be added. The smaller community which demonstrated its "killer appiness" was the bitcoin community, and semi acceptance by millionaire makers. The next step is to show the general public how this "killer appiness" can improve their everyday lives, not try to compete with remittance companies. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:15:22
We also have a solution to that, but can't give everything away :) 
@_date: 2016-10-21 19:29:55
Still around and more active than ever. Don't have as much free time for fun things, but whenever there's something worth writing about - shitco.in

But, if those tips could be easily converted into something that they perceive as valuable (we gave examples in the article), then 1 cent starts to go a long way.

We outlined this weeks ago - 
@_date: 2015-10-20 06:13:09
The end of our article discusses the blockchain summit: 
TCP/IP protocols led us to the age of free information transmittion, and the latest blockchain technology will lead us to the age of free information notorization. Blockchain, a critical milestone in information technology, will restructure the conventional ways of production and organization of the human society.
As the first professional blockchain technology institution in China, Wanxiang Blockchain Labs sincerely invites all interested parties to join our first global blockchain summit,. During the summit, we will discuss the applications and opportunities of blockchain technology in areas, such as Online Payment, Internet of Things (IOT), Securities Trading, and Digital Assets Management. We are expecting around 200 guests attending from various backgrounds, including banking, manufacturing, information technology and academia, etc.
This would lead us to believe that there will be a somewhat friendly stance. We did not say that the government or PBOC said anything officially, it is a play on the "Chinaban" meme we are all too familiar with. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 00:20:22
Thank you for taking the time to read through all of the links. We generally will leave information out in an attempt at brevity, but there is a ton of great evidence/information that further supports our work if you follow the links. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:26:47
The claim was also made for years that - "China banned bitcoin".  Obviously this was over most people's heads. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 04:17:12

Thank you. And the point is to be sarcastic and unique :)

Thank you. Obviously our play on the Chinaban meme was not picked up by most. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 03:35:20
Because if he didn't, he wouldn't fit in with the rest of the crowd ;) 
Obviously we aren't here to take aim at anyone specifically, just outline public information which they have made available themselves. 
It isn't too hard to assemble a few plausible scenarios. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 00:16:21
You're missing out then ;)

There never was a China ban to unban. The original "Chinaban" was based on a posting on a Chinese government website. 
The point of the article was to expose Westerners to what is going on with bitcoin in China, and show that there was a pro bitcoin article from the People's Daily reposted on a government website. 
We make no claims of any policy changes, or official government announcements. Just as the "Chinaban" never really happened, the "China Unbanning" never really happened either. It is simply  play on an old meme, in a creative way to spread some positive bitcoin news. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 00:39:52
Agreed. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 00:19:00
Thank you for the kind words. Is there any reason that the most informative blog in the space is called shitco.in? Ooh the irony ;) 
@_date: 2016-05-10 21:26:34
We were not trying to relate SN and CW via writing analysis. Infer what you believe we were saying differently, and it will help you understand more thoroughly. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 01:13:37
Here is some extra context. The Chinese are already worried about taxation, etc: 
@_date: 2015-10-20 04:37:28
As we stated specifically in the article: We are not suggesting that BTCC is lying in anyway, or that their customers have not received dubious investment solicitations involving bitcoin… but how on earth is a “ponzi” (aka MMM) that has been around since April 2012 sending us somewhat parabolic right now? Common sense would say, it isn’t. Besides that, bitcoin isn’t actually part of the “ponzi”. Those who have done their research know that it is just a way to fund your “ponzi” account. You can also link to your bank account, which is much more convenient for most normies.
What we are stating is that the common idea shared by many the last few days/weeks of the MMM ponzi pumping the price, simply isn't the case. Please see the link in our post referring to the 2012 bitcointalk thread. 
BTCC customers could be receiving solicitations for dubious investments, but the fact that bitcoiners have tied to tie this to the recent price rise is simply a fallacy. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 03:53:45
Lol, we got a chuckle out of that :) 
@_date: 2015-10-20 07:52:01
Based on the tabs at the top of their page, it would appear that they could play a role in crafting regulation. We will see what happens in that regard as we move forward, but the point of the article was to illustrate that there is no threat of an imminent "Chinaban", but most likely the opposite. 
It seems as if this is actual buying in the markets, and not the MMM ponzi as many traders and holders fear. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 05:01:30
As we stated on our other Reddit comments, the Chinese government never officially banned bitcoin, so there was never anything to unban. 
Take a look at this link, the Chinese are discussing/concerned with coming regulation: 
@_date: 2015-10-20 07:48:18
Barely. As stated earlier here on Reddit, the market is going to do what it's going to do. This is a function of supply and demand. 
If the Chinese are warming up to bitcoin, as the recent price rise and spread between exchanges would suggest, that would infer that there is more demand than previously. 
Taking the whole article into context, there are a few other items discussed. One being the MMM "ponzi", which we do not believe is playing a significant role (if any) in the current price rise. This should be relieving to traders and hodlers. 
If a satirical article in a somewhat dead news space, which outlines some misconceptions about the MMM ponzi and shows that there is growing Chinese interest in bitcoin is considered a pump attempt, not sure what to think. 
As we stated earlier on Reddit, the disclaimer was added because we knew people would claim this is a "pump attempt", and wanted full disclosure. Being "long" can imply many things. In our case, it happens to mean that we bought coins quite a while ago and are holding for the long term. What the price does in the meantime is just noise, as long as the technology and ecosystem are moving forward in a positive direction. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 04:00:57
And the title of that report is: "Electronic money regulation on the agenda"
The statement discusses bitcoin (specifically) and blockchain technology (generally), and sheds what appears to be a positive viewpoint on both. 
For anyone who has been around bitcoin for more than a few months, you will know that China never actually "banned" bitcoin. Financial institutions were banned from being involved with it, but not individuals. Hence, OKC and Huobi operating as is. 
The common "meme" from that time period was "China banned bitcoin". This was prevalent on Reddit, and every other bitcoin friendly corner of the internet. 
Putting the pieces together, one will realize that the title is simply a play on what so many of us here had joked around about years ago. In regards to the price, the market will act independent of what you, we or any other traders/hodlers desire. The price of bitcoin is a function of supply an demand, not any type of news as you have seen for the last few years. As long term hodlers who have been in coin since the double digits, the price is somewhat irrelevant as long as the ecosystem continues to grow and stay positive.

It is Google translated, unfortunately. 
Agreed, it's a tough read. But you can make it out if you give it a few minutes. Pretty amazing content in there to be honest. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 07:37:43
I thought we had more love than that :( Thanks though :)~
@_date: 2015-10-20 05:29:58
The point is that China never actually banned bitcoin, and are appearing to be more than bitcoin friendly. 
Some articles are more intellectually stimulating than others, so feel free to browse through the rest of our content at your leisure if you wish. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 00:39:48
Us too. Really surprised no one picked up on it sooner. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 06:25:08
Yes, it is a copy of a news report on a Chinese government website. They are pretty tightly controlled, so could it be safe to assume that a re-posting of a positive btc article is a good thing?
The blockchain summit and Blockchain Labs being established are very positive for the eco-system. 
As we have stated, there never was a China ban to unban. This is just a play on the "Chinaban" meme. It doesn't appear as if there is going to be an actual Chinaban now that things are unfolding. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:31:27
Neither are we. The "unbanning" is clearly satire, as the "banning" was never a real thing in the first place. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 05:14:09
Amazing. Wish we had that for the post earlier. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 00:19:37
Thank you! We hope you will continue reading. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:32:57
Thank you for the feedback. Feel the same way after reading a little bit of your post history :P
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:33:30
Where is it suggested that readers should put all of their money into btc? As always, diversification and doing your own research are key. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 03:55:57
True.. Those would be interesting numbers indeed. Makes you wonder what's actually going on in China though, and if there is potentially some truth behind the theories regarding the Chinese government acquiring bitcoins.
