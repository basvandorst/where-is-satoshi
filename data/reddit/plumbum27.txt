That's a tough question to answer based on the info you provided. You will also get biased answers here as you would in the gold subreddit.
The answer will come from your risk appetite, goals, long &amp; short term outlook, etc.
I think gold has a lot of upside potential in this current market but I think Bitcoin has a much greater upside albeit with much greater risk. As long as it wouldn't change your life if you lost the money I think Bitcoin is the better bet.
You also don't have to spend money on hardware for storage of Bitcoin. The best thing you can do is learn the proper way to create paper wallets on bitaddress.org, lock it away in a safe or safe deposit box and forget about it.

Print out 3 copies of 28 paper wallets (7 per page) on bitaddress.org using an offline computer and a strong BIP38 password. 
Randomly choose 2 addresses and test to make sure they work with the password. Once you confirm they work cross out those two addresses on all 3 copies so you never use them.
Get a wallet at Blockchain.info and put in the first 10 addresses as watch only. Split your cold storage between the first few addresses and if you don't want them to show up as available balances then archive them.
Put one copy of your paper wallet  in a safe deposit box, another at a trusted family members house, and keep the 3rd at your own house in a safe.
Think of these addresses as your savings accounts and send extra BTC to any of those addresses whenever you want. 
This will take you an hour or two, cost you near nothing and is much safer then any computer storage.

Internet Gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry in the US and currently very difficult to get dollars into and out of.
Porn is a multi-billion dollar industry and has a lot of issues with fraud, charge backs, and shady payment processors.
Illegal drugs is a multi-billion dollar industry and no matter what the laws are will always exist.
It's not too far of a stretch to imagine all three of these industries having at least 20% of their transactions being processioned in a digital currency similar to Bitcoin in 10 years... even with the draw backs you outline.
You bring up a lot of valid concerns and all of which are being worked on in some form. Even if Bitcoin does not become the internet/retail success so many hope for it still solves a lot of issues and opens a lot of doors for certain niches.

The Treasury Department will come after the many digital currency exchanges and administrators that haven’t registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Department’s top official for terrorism and financial intelligence said Tuesday.
However, David S. Cohen, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, stressed that the U.S. government’s approach to regulating digital currencies such as bitcoin is driven by a desire to foster innovation and transparency in an industry that has significant potential.
We “know there are many virtual currency exchangers and administrators that have not registered with FinCEN and are not fulfilling their recordkeeping and reporting requirements,” Mr. Cohen said, speaking at an event at Bloomberg News in New York. “Those that do not comply with these rules should understand that their actions will have consequences.”
He said Treasury’s approach to enforcing and devising rules for digital currency use “is rooted in two guiding principles: fostering innovation and ensuring transparency.” He described this stance as “more measured and, I would submit, more sensible” than those of countries such as Russia, which sought to ban digital currencies outright.
“We place real value on the benefits of financial innovation,” Mr. Cohen said. “Advancements in technology that allow entrepreneurs and businesses to innovate, grow and hire are crucial to our country’s long-term economic success.”
But he added, “we have a critical responsibility to protect the U.S. economy from illicit finance threats,” which he cited as real concern with virtual currencies, one that threatened their long-term viability.
Mr. Cohen said the Treasury Department is working with other governments and multilateral institutions to seek to draft consistent rules for digital currencies around the world. He said the international Financial Action Task Force, which sets standards for anti-money-laundering and counterterrorist financing practices, will later this year release a paper that will update common definitions for digital currencies and lay out potential benefits and vulnerabilities for the sector.
He also said that the Treasury will include a representative from the digital currency sector to sit on its Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Board.

You nailed it. We used to have an option of using cash based on our risk appetite for that transaction. The internet changed all that and fueled the credit card monopolies.

Great article. Even through all the carnage lately it's nice to see some good articles being written. 
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:37:09
Wow. Knocked down that wall fast.
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:23:59
Hmmmm I have used this process many times including this morning and have never had a problem. Perhaps the teller entered the tx wrong. I would be inclined to think your $$$$ is okay. It just may take a few days to get back. 
FYI I just looked on my deposit slip and there is nothing to indicate it was done in cash... unless there is some code I don't understand. 
Good luck
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:41:49
Thank you! Seems weird to me but so was BTC at first I guess. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:52:09
Wow... Thank you kind sir. I will make sure to re-tip 110% of what you gave me.
I only want to pass the message along. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:03:08
I 100% agree with you.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:38:34
I have deposited up to $900 without ID. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 12:13:55
Just an FYI: I have used bitfloor with cash deposits at BOA 3 times this week and the money was in my account ready to trade within 1/2 hour. Very impressed.
I will never go back to Bitinstant as long as Bitfloor is working out so well.
Prior to this I used Bitme quite a bit but they seemed to have gone AWOL
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:10:07
For once they had a very professional and well written response. While its still there I was sure the lag would be much worse than it is considering the circumstances. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:40:23
Awesome! Great job Erik

This... it's all about use and addoption... NOT the price.
@_date: 2013-03-19 00:16:46
Oh this is exactly what I was looking for! PERFECT!
Unfortunately there is not a single listing in the Chicago area but I'm sure that will change.
Great job guys!
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:59:31
I use Campbx as well and would love some sort of chart like Clarkmoody. I have seen the users increase on Campbx in the last day. They seem to be getting a lot of people moving over from GOX. Currently there are over 13,000 at CBX
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:27:17
Eh... I can see an employee damaging their phone somehow and expecting me to replace it. Not a good idea IMO.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:23:52
Yes, please explain this. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:53:54
Not instantly. I was trying all day yesterday. The fastest I know of is Bitfloor via BOA cash deposits but I am sure there is a limit. I was doing $1,000 per deposit and went to a few different BOA's
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:29:36
I have never had a problem with CB. Buying, selling, transferring in and out has always worked perfect for me. 
EDIT: Now that I think about it I have had a problem getting the buy/sell price to update in the android app but for me it's not a huge deal. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:10:40
I only copied the title from the article... I suppose I could have redone it. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:54:43
Losing China?
People are still able to buy and sell Bitcoin. The same people who are desperate for investments in things other then real estate. Bitcoin is just as much a great store of value as it is a currency.
The rest of the world can use Bitcoin's currency properties.

Corrected. Thanks
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:57:53
Otherwise you can get Money Orders from the USPS and mail them to CampBX but it takes a few days
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:02:26
Probably a little of both. I used a guy named xraymikek on Local bitcoins a few times for buying back when BTC was cheap. I see he is still on there and would recommend him to anyone in the area. I always met him at a Starbucks by his house in Schaumburg. Never a problem. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:53:37
Faster addoption will create a larger voice when the governments start to go after it. A fast rising price is creating a lot of attention and this is a good thing. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:51:59
ACH is going to take a while. I recommend a cash deposit at BOA using bitfloor. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:22:43
I would LOVE to buy in this little downswing. Unfortunately Bitfloor is holding steady at $72 right now. :(
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:26:51
Western Union &amp; Moneygram are perfectly setup to step into this market. Although I realize this kind of eats at their core business. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:22:02
I guess I don't understand when people say that greater Bitcoin adoption will mean the end of Paypal. Bitcoin by it's nature is very merchant friendly which at the same time is problematic to the consumer when there is 0% chance of charge-back. Paypal of the other hand has generally been seen as consumer friendly. The melding of these two powerhouses could create a consumer friendly version of Bitcoin with off chain transactions and consumer protections. I just don't see Bitcoin becoming adopted on a larger scale without third party intermediaries like Paypal and Mastercard is to fiat. 
Retailers can for the first time offer "cash" discounts online for on-chain transactions similar to the way a lot of local retailers offer cash discounts. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:44:34
Amazing! I cant stand Paypal but the very thought that such a large company is "thinking" about it is simply awesome.
@_date: 2013-03-22 04:33:47
I have heard $1000 so I keep my deposits at $900 and have never had to show ID.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:35:50
I agree. Simply a bot on most forums would be a huge success. Allowing people to tip and throw bitcents around forums with recognition of the tip would be a huge light shined onto BTC. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:03:29
I honestly don't know what their limit is and my whole goal was to not show an ID so I kept things low. There are a bunch of BOA's by me so I just did $1,000 at each one so as to not raise any red flags (sometimes tellers can get nosey)
It works great but now I am reading that Bitfloor is having withdrawal problems so you might want to stay away until that gets resolved.
For the past week or so I have been using CampBX and sending money orders in via snail mail. So far so good. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:21:41
What a great idea 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:30:14
Any exchange, localbitcoins.com, fastcash4bitcoins.com, and a few others.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:34:58
I can see both sides of the argument and it is a constant tug-o-war in my head on what to do. I originally started back in the fall with a 100 BTC to test out using BTCSportsmatch.com. I love the concept of Bitcoin and my intention was to have a large portion of my gambling bankroll in it to move money around to various sportsbooks as the UIGA has blocked off most paths. My meager purchase of BTC along with some nice winnings has turned into a good amount of money. My original goal was to stick with BTC and sink or swim with it. I, like most feel it will either be worth $10,000 in 10 years or $0 with very little chance for an in-between. The run up since January has made me more concerned day by day.... I am enjoying it but there is a good part of me that is thinking this is too good to be true and there will be a substantial correction magnified with panic.
I can really only speak for a BTC market cap from a gambling perspective as that is what my intentions are to use it for. I do know that the worldwide amount spent on gambling is in excess of 40 billion dollars. Gambling is legal in most of the world so there is very little need for BTC for those people. I have heard that around 10 Billion is spent in the US gambling with around 90% done illegally. Between paying local bookies and sending money to offshore sports books Bitcoin has a very bright future in that regard. I am not sure how to value a currency based on those figures but I could easily see billions in transactions related to gambling in just a few short years.
IMO this volatility and stratospheric rise is great for us holders but bad for the BTC economy in general... at least for right now. You would have to be on crack to want to spend any BTC right now on any good or service unless you absolutely have too (silkroad). 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:34:01
If we simply accept that we need one central entity to succeed for Bitcoin to succeed we have already lost and this will keep happening again and again. Fool me once shame on you... fool me twice shame on me.
I don't daytrade and need a deep orderbook and I doubt most here do therefore sites like bitfloor and campbx work great.  
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:40:10

I have an account at Gox as well but have not used it. Nothing against Gox I just find it VERY easy to get money into BitFloor with the cash deposits at BofA. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:17:15
I don't know about the best way but it certainly is the fastest. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:36:36
This smells Goxy
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:51:53
I agree. I bought over 100 around $15 (using localbitcoins) and slowly added a few since. I was basically at my limit of how much I want to put into it and stopped buying around $150 guessing what was going on was unhealthy. I never thought I would see BTC under $100 again and IMO this is an over-correction based upon the VC seed money coming in along with other news I have read.
Contrary to a lot of the drama posted on here Bitcoin is fine and has just as much of a chance of succeeding as it did last week. This is price discovery at work and I like to use the analogy of what a company is going through pre-IPO... it's most of the stuff on the inside that we don't get to see from the likes of Google and Facebook when they where just starting out. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 13:08:30

I agree. I find it amusing all of those that have not been through this weekly roller coaster. It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better. Inadequate exchanges, attacks, theft. Welcome to the world without regulation. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:01:52
Another great discussion!
That's two today. Good to see. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:06:38
This wont be the last drop either. Bitcoin is driven by a lot of emotion and emotions can be very volatile.
Remember... it's not about the price, it about use and adoption. A rise in price will naturally follow suit. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 01:09:13
Yes, use Bitfloor. Just as easy and seems faster.

The US tax system is ultimately based on the honor system.
We can hate taxes all we want but you still better pay them because the consequences are brutal. Anyone that has a large dislike for the tax system should spend all their time trying to change the laws and not finding ways around them. Eventually the IRS catches up.... they always do.

Not if you are into it for the long haul and truly believe in Bitcoin.

That was my first thought as well but if that is the case BF could just open a new account at a different bank and stop all the transactions that caused problems... ie cash deposits. Something tells me there is a little more to the story. Businesses just don't shut down when one bank says they don't want their business anymore. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:51:54
Unfortunately I've seen it much higher.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:53:56
For larger amounts on Blockchain that you don't plan on touching I would recommend:
* Creating at least 4 brand new address's
* Send the coins through the mixer to these new address in equal amounts
* Print out paper wallets for each address and keep them in a safe deposit box at a bank... if it's life changing amounts perhaps at two different banks
* Turn each address into "watch only" on blockchain.info (remove the private keys)
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:13:01
While this is true for SecondMarket it may not apply to the three companies listed who are providing the IRA services through SM. I will contact these companies next week to see if they implement accreditation rules unless someone already knows the answer. I would love to stick a very small amount of my IRA into XBT.
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:10:42
I would also recommend BitFloor. I always use the cash deposits through BOA and never have had an issue. Account is usually credited within 5 minutes of the deposit.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:39:28
Too bad. I figured since I am in this for the long haul I might as well earn some interest. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:17:54
I used Bit instant once... it wasn't terrible but I never did it again. I fealt it was more of a pain then anything and by the time it was done the transaction costs where a lot.
I really like CampBX so far although there orderbook is quite shallow... it does seem to be improving. Over 500 new accounts there with all that went on yesterday. I actually was going to wire $ to campBX but it does not seem to be an option which is why I am sending in USPS moneyorders. They accept personal check but you have to wait for them to clear which takes a while. USPS money orders are instant.
Since you are over 10K check out Tradehill.com. I requested to sign up a week ago and still have not heard anything though.
Also Coinsetter.com looks very promising but it's not even in beta yet. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:52:15
What a great and on target article. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:52:42
The best part is the article includes thoughts about what has happened the last couple days. My hope is that some VC money can get together some decent exchanges that can be scaled correctly.

@_date: 2013-04-24 17:12:49
I agree, I thought it would drop further also. I set a buy on Bitfinex @ 150.1 and just missed the bottom. IMO BTC is looking stronger everyday and emotions seem a bit more constrained since the large crash.
@_date: 2013-05-23 13:03:48
What a great speech. I will now refer all the people I come along that question BTC to this article. Awesome! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:30:33
It will get better with time and money. Everyone expects to snap their fingers and everything to magically scale and work properly. We are still in the Alpha phase of Bitcoin and there is a lot of growing pains happening right now.

Yeah I suppose. I am into it for the long haul though. I really believe it could be worth 5K per coin easy once all the wrinkles get ironed out and providing the government doesn't come down on it. I think it will take hold much more easily in unstable countries then it will in the US or Euro.
I'm not going to lie... I sure wish I had sold at $250 but one thing I have learned is I am terrible at timing the markets. I am usually better off taking a long term approach.

To your 2nd point... How would that differ then what we have now? The markets set the price, if it happens to be lower then when one bought that's life.
Whatever the solution (if there is one) I hope it is more decentralized then what we have now.... the problem is I have a hard time visualizing it. People will flock to the deepest orderbook with the tightest spreads and lowest costs, it's human nature.

I sent Bitcoin acceptance emails to Pandora, Spotify, and Slacker more times then I can count. Same response every time. 
IMO Spotify seems the most likely as one of their founders is involved with Bitcoin somehow.

Hard to say. Huge volume for sure. The interview with the BTC China exchange owner that came out today was interesting. It's so hard to understand what the Chinese think of XBT and why they are buying. They certainly started the rally and in some respects seem to be leading the way but there is a lot of hype along with valid large investments like SecondMarket. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:34:29
Yes, this is the only way I have been buying BTC lately. The exchange rate is higher then GOX usually. I highly recommend this method. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:07:48
Just register on there site with an email. Select deposit with cash, enter amount (keep it under $1,000 to avoid showing your ID), deposit CASH at the closest BOA with an "out of state deposit slip" and your Bitfloor account is credited within 5 or so minutes.
VERY simple and very easy.
I did $900 yesterday and the fee (from BitFloor's processor) was about $30.00
I have used this many, many times without a single incident including multiple times in a single day. I have never been asked to show my ID. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:56:50

When I looked yesterday (at the bottom of the page) there where 13,007 members. In 24 hours there is over 700 more so hopefully things will pick up. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:15:21
I disagree. I think nearly all of this latest run-up has to do with large investors like SecondMarket. They alone have basically stated that they bought 14 million worth in the last month or so. Now I hear SM will be working with companies to potentially bring XBT to individual IRA's. This is all a lot of money coming in. Bitcoin REALLY needs a larger retailer to accept it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:58:13

I agree. I've bought many coins on Bitfloor the last couple months and never had one problem. Big thumbs up. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:24:45
Very true. I am not pretending to know how to solve the problem but I do know there are people working on it. Between ideas like Ripple, BitcoinX, and a few others that have floated around Bitcointalk we can hopefully come to some sort of solution.
I personally like the idea of a P2P open orderbook with gateways (exchanges) matching buyers and sellers while handling the fiat... although I know there is also many issues with this as well.

Best news I have heard in a while. IMO this has to be the biggest news of the year. First the political donation ruling and now this. What a great week for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.

Move to Costa Rica just like the gambling industry did.

Absolutely not. If you have anything over 10BTC at CBX and need to get out fast you are screwed.... just not enough volume. If you are looking for a good place to send your money to and buy while staying in the US and without ID's CBX is the place right now. Get USPS money orders and send them via snail mail.

I love that second quote. Finally a great article from a major source with very little negative connotations. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:33:27
GOX has stated by the end of June they should have there new trading software in place along with hardware they are continuously adding. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 20:54:21
This is pretty big news. Yes eToro is very small by Forex standards but it seems it will be traded alongside the rest of the worlds currency in the same interface. Very cool. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:21:35
What company did you use to set this up? I would be interested. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:08:40
Wow! Huge news!

I didn't get an invite only a welcome email to which I replied with some questions and received a quick response
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:26:07
Thank you. The Coinkite system looks promising. Not too much info on Circle yet. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:19:24
Yeah, don't read the comments.... and people say bitcoiners are the ones with tinfoil hats... sheesh. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:46:22
There is a seller on local Bitcoins in the Chicago area that I have dealt with a few times and advertises up to $100,000. Never had a problem in dealing with him. xraymike i believe is his username. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:53:21
I've learned to stay away from the comments for my sanity. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:06:15
This place is awfully dramatic the last 24 hours. NOTHING has changed with Bitcoin. Last week at this time we where at $120 and right now Camp BX and Bitfloor are trading right at $120.
Growing pains... that's all it is, growing pains. 
If you are that pissed off about things then you probably have way too much of your $ tied up in this EXPERIMENT. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:08:51
Yes, I signed up yesterday and I actually got a personal response and thank you. I chatted back and forth with the guy and he was very helpful. Very promising.
My belief is that by the end of the summer we will have a few more very capable exchanges which will bring a little more stability and access.  
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:28:04
Let's just hope it's a matter of adding servers unlike GOX who has to completely rewrite there software. That being said I think GOX has gotten much better since their "cool down" period. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:10:45
Cashed out 30K a couple weeks ago. No problems at all.

I'm not donating my coins to anyone who won't take them. I have written them about it as have a lot of others and it's clear right now they don't want them. It's their loss. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 05:25:06
Yes, for sure anything 10K and over in cash will be reported to the Gov but those nosey tellers will start asking questions about anything suspicious as there is a voluntary form they can file for amounts under 10K in cash. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:46:00
No clue on that but I doubt it as they give pretty specific instructions about it having to be CASH and be done in person.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:49:32
It's funny how after the crash I have seen more decent coverage and intelligent discussions then before. I look forward to the road ahead. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 00:32:42
All I have to say is WOW! Someone finally stepped up to the plate and did it! I wasn't really planning on buying any BTC today but I bought 5 to test things out and it worked beautifully. Thank you Coinbase!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:49:35
I agree that it will probably keep happening unfortunately... at least for the short term. 
I do think however there are HUGE opportunity's for the right people with VC money to create a good exchange that can scale correctly. Things like this take time... lots of time. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:23:57
I have a wallet and account but I cant seem to figure out how to get XRP. Any help on this?

Bought 100 XBT  over a year ago from some shady character off localbitcoins.com and have been enjoying this roller coaster ever since. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:45:09
I wondered this as well. Next time they put Jimmy on top begging I will email them and tell them I will donate $100 but in BTC only. Take it or leave it. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:29:28
Damn USA! I want one!

The difference is you can use skill to beat sports bookmakers in the long run. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:15:20
Same with me. I saw it get down to $60 earlier and I was trying to get money in there fast but I didn't have authorization.
Others are selling... I'm buying. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:43:51
I'm from the northwest suburbs of Chicago and bought $1,000's off localbitcoins with no issues at all. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 22:31:11
More then a few brokerages offer deposit bonuses. Trading of any kind is gambling at it's core and yes 95% of the people fail just like poker and sports wagering as well. I know very little about eToro and it seems very gimmicky but clearly geared towards the small retail do it yourselfers. That being said they still are registered with all the financial regulatory agency's needed which makes Bitcoins inclusion that much more impressive. I would be absolutely shocked if 888 had anything at all to do with eToro at all. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:32:27
Wow! Can we please get more discussions like that!
Great job Bloomberg
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:41:27
Wow.... I was not expecting him to say that! Bravo! 
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:08:23
Being able to short XBT on a large scale at the exchanges would also keep downward pressure as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:21:48
Yeah I suppose there could be issues for large amounts. I have built up trust with a couple local people in my area through small transactions over time and never had an issue. Keep in mind when you hear terrible stories it is more of the exception rather then the rule. Most people out there are not looking to screw anyone over.
Also Localbitcoins offers a built in escrow service although I have not used it yet. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:12:59
Nope... never had a BofA account in my life. All you do is fill out a checking deposit slip and use cash so there is really no need for them to know who you are. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:51:45
Well I cant speak to any of that. All I know is I have never had a problem but I also don't use BTC for drugs and TOR either.
It's not illegal to purchase BTC so I would have no problem purchasing from a FED agent.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:28:55
Great article. Bitcoin has a bright future.

I would recommend Bitfloor with cash deposits at BOA. It's working great for me so far this week.

Sheesh... How long is Peter Vessenes going to be allowed to be involved with the Bitcoin Foundation and drag it's name through the mud? When is enough enough?

Bought tickets last Friday as well. Couldn't ask for a better experience. Great place to spend your coins. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:08:38
Yes, I noticed that the fee always seems different and more then the last time. If it wasn't so easy I would probably complain more. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 20:55:27
It will be interested to see how it is implemented. It surely is like no other currency they deal with from a transaction standpoint. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 14:50:50
This is a great video and a great view point. Well done Chris.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:11:31
Where did I imply it was going to take over? I simply stated it has a bright future which I believe. I certainly don't think it's going to take over anything nor would that be possible without a huge fight as you point out. 
I do However think it will make an excellent alternative to the current government based mess the fractional reserve system has created.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:04:28
Too many people forget that. We are not even to version 1.0 yet.

WOW! I am truly impressed by how fast you smart programmers can implement this stuff. This is great for Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:18:57
Agreed. Price discovery can be a real bitch. If there is one thing for sure it's that we will over shoot AND over correct. A lot of people will be hurt.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:55:32
I have that app as well but unfortunately CBX doesn't support graphs on it.
I also agree that it seemed laggy yesterday. Hopefully the way they are structured though it is simply a matter of adding a couple servers rather then a complete software re-write like what GOX is going through right now. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 00:50:11
No. The BTC is in your Coinbase account right away however it still takes 3-5 days to pull the fiat out of your bank account.
@_date: 2013-03-14 19:49:24
Thanks. I enjoyed it!
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:30:43
That's the way it should be. Bitcoin mentioned alongside all the other markets in a daily recap. I hope they keep it up. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 14:01:59
For what it's worth I think this is huge for Bitcoin if someone can step up and make a high quality service similar to Intrade. I am a semi-professional sports gambler and have followed Bitcoin for a while now. My main interest in BTC is to move large sums of money to and from sports books which the UIGA basically cut off in 2005.
Intrade was referenced countless times on CNN and other news organizations throughout the last US election. If someone is capable of getting up a site as nice as Intrade before the next election cycle there could be A LOT of free publicity and I believe it would really take off. Huge opportunity for the right person.

However I would really like to know why BF's bank account was shut down so that CBX isn't the next one when my money is there. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:52:37
I have used CB for a few months now mostly buying but also selling in max 50BTC segments and never once had a problem. I am with a small community bank. Perhaps certain large banks are messing with people when they see a "Coinbase" transaction come through and relay info to CB as a high risk account.
