I love the btc community on irc, and the majority of folks I met at the conferences were friendly... Does reddit just attract a lot of riffraff?

It's not dangerous for ghash's business because they do not intend to attack the network.
Last week, Petamine owners overwhelmingly voted for switching to p2pool but there was some comparability issue that they are currently working on.

Would the switch lead to reduced profits for petamine?

Wow.  While you're over there massively generalizing about people, just remember the amount of work the bitcoin community has done to get to this point and remember how many people have been robbed due to scamcoins.

Wouldn't switching to p2pool mean less profits?

Why do so many idiots think that this report means that gox bought ALL the coins leading to the rally? No.  Gox created the sense of urgency and emotional investors (myself included) bought because we were given incorrect market information .

This is a magnificent idea but people seem to balk at the idea of "voting by funding"...
If you don't have money or skills to contribute to the foundation, do you think your opinion is useful?  Do you think you should have an equal voice as those who are actually doing the work while you just sit there and click yes/no?  Will your vote even be as well thought out as someone donating the money they worked for?  There are certainly exceptions, but I say generally: no.
...And why should someone else decide what my "donation" gets spent on?  When I donate money towards a particular aspect of this new foundation, it is because that aspect is valuable to me and I want it to progress.  I may not have the legal or software skills to do it myself, so I will use my own skillset to earn money which I will use to fund the projects that I personally find valuable.
I do, however, think including votes as a secondary metric would be a great way to get a qualitative pulse of the community's feelings and will help bring light to overlooked projects, but the votes should not decide where the money goes  (although we could eventually create an additional "grabbag" fund who's allocation is decided only by votes).  
I want to see this idea come to fruition, if there's a team looking for non-programmatic help please pm me.  I have experience working with bitcoin companies and start-ups.

Awesome, keep up the good work!  Thanks!

Wait, are you saying you are against this:  ?
@_date: 2014-06-20 20:41:33
Thanks all.  Do you think relying on donations is a sustainable model or is this only a temporary solution?  Doesn't it retract from the whole "working selfishly is what's best for everyone" which is part Bitcoin's strength?
@_date: 2014-12-01 16:53:58
It depends on the state you are selling in... Also, you don't need to worry if you're selling only a few thousand $ per year
Either way, don't sell to scumbags
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:53:22
This.  But to their credit, Coinbase, Bitpay, &amp; Circle are still making sure their platforms are solid.  Hopefully soon we'll start to see legit commercials/advertising.
@_date: 2014-08-03 04:51:51
I'm sure they'd reimburse you if it's legitimate

Hey thanks asshole, I woulda liked to see that ethereum post as would lots of my fellow bitcoiners... Zeroblock doesn't have an option to add more redditt subs and that app is the only reason I come to this shithole of the internet.

I think they are clear in their blog: "To complete the Coinbase Vault offering, we will be adding multi-signature (“multi-Sig”) technology in the coming weeks to enable customers to manage their own vault security...We will release our multi-sig vault approach as well once it has been appropriately vetted by security teams both internally at Coinbase and externally."
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:48:28
agreed, but perhaps this is the first step to getting his current and new customers to start using btc as payment.  Once his business can sustain itself on BTC payments, he can do away w/ credit cards... just maybe...

Don't U think btc can innovate and evolve?  It's open sourced and is meant to be modified and upgraded over time...it's incredibly early it crypto life, changes will require time and patience.
