Lots of men associate their self worth with their asset worth. Hard to break this mindset and realize the trinkets you collect through life are not a representation of your worth. Sorry for your loss. :/

What I posted was documented fact:

Transaction fees and loan interest, same way real banks make money on nothing.  Only difference is one currency is elastic and the other is not.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:25:02


Same bullshit excuses Gox is using?  


Rumsfeld said exactly that: 
"We know it's gone. But we don't know what they spent it on"


I'll stick to facts, maybe you can too (maybe post a source?).

What I find funny - there have been worse fuckups with our current monetary system and literally no media attention.  Take for example 2 TRILLION missing the day before 9/11.  Did you even know?  Look it up.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:02:05
Well it would't have applied anyways, but it's an epic fuck up anyways.  Regulations will come to bitcoin too.

Currencies follow a natural progression in their rise and fall:
1) Currency is adopted and inflation is controlled.  Buying power is somewhat predictable.
2) "Banks" realize they can loan out more currency than they have on hand to reap interest rewards on nothing (this is called fractional reserve banking).  
3) Instead of lending the physical currency, IOUs/deposit receipts are traded in lieu of currency.
4) More IOUs circulate than actual deposits causing inflation, consumers begin to notice loss of buying power.
5) A "bank run" begins as people redeem IOUs for currency revealing the naked bankrupt bank.
I'm not saying this is the case, but in actual fact our fiat currencies follow this pattern.

Explain fractional reserve banking?

Conspiracy had the same problem a month ago, turns out it was r/conspiratard users the admins caught.  They are the type of crowd that is very pro establishment.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:48:22
It was CBS News but you sorta missed the point, it completely blew over (like you're doing right now) like it was a non issue.  Had this been a company saying HEY GUYS WE CAN'T FIND 2.3 TRILLION there would be a shitstorm (like gox). 
But yeah I'm sure they 'found it' just as our debt grew from ~6T to ~15T in the years since.

Head of pentagon finance said it.  Rumsfeld said first quote.   Why are you so agressively defending this?  Where are your sources? Insults are poor form brother.

I actually do have a fairly clean laptop but I still don't trust it. Loading things like java (which has usually been involved in attack vectors) for development make me lose confidence.  Even a fresh box disconnected from the Internet isn't safe, just research STUXNET.  Who knows how many zero days are out there, and given the NSA scandals I'm not sure some backdoor are entirely purposeful.  Some articles reveal backdoor at the bios level so nothing is secure.
For a few coins I'm sure I would get by, but for a serious investor I would want fort Knox.  I'm sure there are third party companies that host wallets, but what guarantee do I have they won't close their doors and server farms in the caymens?
So it's really a pickle for me unless I invest a serious amount of time to understand the technology to the point of comfort.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:18:39
It's CBS and there are hundreds of other articles, but I'm still waiting on a source that verifies they found it.  My point stands, they lost accounting for 2 trillion.  No need to get worked up over facts.
This is like saying Gox coins aren't lost, we just don't know where they went.

I know Java in the browser is a bad idea, but frankly so is every single plugin and many of us rely on them (flash, ad block, etc). But assuming it's free of any these there is always risk of infection from wireless/usb sticks/router etc.  
I like the idea of a honey pot, or having so many wallets the intruder wouldn't know which one to attack.  The wallet program would have to simulate a user accessing a wallet randomly and frequently.  Perhaps the most frequent wallet would contain some honey (a small amount) which would alarm once pulled.  Just some ideas, but making the assumption your system is hostile 100% of the time.

Right, it's far too complex to understand so everyone should just trust a few guys to do what's right.  Take a look at the fed balance sheets and let me know how it's going.

Why are you bringing up corporations?  You state banks don't make money off nothing, so please prove it. 
Here is the proof they do:


Banks lend out money they don't have, it's how the system works and why we have inflation.

I really don't care about minor errors in argument, but apparently you do.  I'm on a mobile so pulling sources isn't much fun.  
So the press release a year later talks about billions, not trillions.  You do realize the exact same defense could be used for gox?  Hey, those coins aren't missing, they are just in another system!  lol
anyways it's been fun, good night

I am sceptical of it replacing cash, it's a government dream since all transactions are on a pubic ledger.  Can anyone describe, in an NSA age how you can have a private transaction without any other knowledge?
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:46:13
Also, many deleted files can be recovered (like log files).  Put the disks on ice and give it to someone that knows their stuff.  The longer the computers run, the more chance the deleted blocks (files) will be actually overwritten.

How can btc replace cash transactions with it's public ledger.  Wouldn't it mean, in theory, every transaction could be taxed?

Well to be fair it is still subject to market manipulation since anyone with a lot of fiat money can simply purchase a large enough share to rattle the market.  There is no way to see who owns what, which is perfect for shadow banking.  The real kicker is what happens when the lights go out?
