Are you going to develop more user friendly options for tipping? (like a chrome extension?)
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:47:40
Thanks for the input. 200 bits
@_date: 2014-11-11 04:20:44
Haha! I forgot bits at the end. There you go
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:12:59

@_date: 2014-11-11 02:59:14
Thanks for the input. I'll refrain tipping to 200 bits

Now that's a good idea! 200 bits
@_date: 2014-11-11 03:26:29
I might get some doge then! 200 bits
@_date: 2014-11-11 03:35:02
Thanks man! Is there somewhere I can look to figure out how to collect this?

Things like this makes me think that Bitcoin will not succeed due the the huge skew of distribution. I do however think that cryptocurrencies will become the future of money.

Man i see you all over the place!
@_date: 2014-11-11 03:32:46
