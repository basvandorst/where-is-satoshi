Can I read the KFC whitepaper, where can I trade KFC/BTC?

Well youre not going to be a millionaire but it could double, triple, even 5x
My friend put in 20 and it turned into 50 and he pulled it out for Xmas gifts.
As long as youre OK losing all the money they put it in, forget about it, and see what happens

I don't like them either. I stay in the sub for the occasional quality post, not the memes or the personal stories.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:18:52
I doubt anything less than 5 will happen, I'm hoping for a low 8/high 7 to buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:48:26
Oh wow, I went in with $40 cuz I knew odds were against me, I ended up with $40.8 before I quit. 
Hope you can afford that loss!

I have more than 2¢ in crypto haha, I was saying "just my two cents" as in the saying, but I converted to btc.

I think it's more that they are excited and many people in this sub are on the same path. 
The layman doesn't really understand buying a tesla for Bitcoin. Sure they get the concept but they don't get the FUD that it comes with risking your money and watching it grow over months/years, but anyone here does. It doesn't matter if you turned $10 into $11 or $1000 into $50,000 we all kinda get it. 
I don't think they post to brag or to make us excited for them, it's just this is one of the only outlets that can go to.

Buy something with $10 of BTC
Buy $10 of BTC
you end up the same as buying with USD but it helps spread bitcoins usages, which increases price. 
Hodling means not cashing out, not not using Bitcoin

Everyone is expecting a price drop soon. Don't sell, buy more. It's the easiest way to come up on top. 
Especially with a smaller buy of $25, if you lose 30% of that (from a big drop) that is less than the price of lunch, but if you try to play it you could lose a lot more.
Just my 0.000002btc , do what you want.

Not a popping bubble type of crash, but if you look at the last few bull runs there are a significant drops after, there should be sell walls at 10k as well.
Maybe 10-30% drop, I just want to be ready.

  &gt;&gt;Zero reason
Spreading awareness, which increases interest, increases demand, increases price

Coin base is the easiest and has (one of) the highest  fees.
I recommend it for noobs. Or use GDAX, it's the same as coinbase (same login, etc.) but it has less than 1/3 of the fees. 
Transferring out of GDAX is also free, so you should be using it anyway it you take your money out of an exchange and into a personal wallet (you should control your keys).
You can also set orders so you don't have to buy at the current market price, less noob friendly but if you're spending more than a couple hundred the saving in fees is for sure worth the small learning curve. 
I can't speak much for other exchanges.

I shorter during the ETH flippening, doubled my money. But Christ I would never do that again.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:11:05
My plan is to move into XMR, LTC, ETH, and VRT if/when BTC crashes, if I can predict it well enough.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:01:47
Just wait until you own 10-20 alts, lots of research comes in...

No... It's not.

They might tell other companies to use Bitcoin, other customers might see you using it

It's proabaly a good idea to back up the private keys on a hard drive that old.
Shoot me a PM, I can do it for you.

Less than 21 million people will own a full coin, we can't all do it!

I'm sorry but I doubt it, every post I've seen have said some form of:
 "I'm cashing out now, because I need to, I'll be back"
"I'm cashing out now because I'm set for life"
I haven't seen any that have said "I'm cashing out now, I think BCH is a better investment, so I'm moving all of my eggs from one basket to another"
Even roger ver himself still holds BTC, I don't know any smart person who has switched over completely.
The only way this is the case is if 'cashing out' is subliminal for switching to bcash
