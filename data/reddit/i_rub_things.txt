It does not take 48hrs to make a transaction for BTC - Go talk shit online somewhere else it only makes me laugh.

I have thought about it but never tried it. The reason I did not is that I think* it was coinbase that would come online then off for a while , I assume in responses to BTC price fluctuation but idk. Thanks for giving some ideas though , I really appreciate it.

Convenience. I am disabled and I can't get to a bank as needed sometimes.I have tried Virwox but for some reason I cannot initialize a payment to them so I stopped trying. I was given a Vanilla gift card with $100 on it and tryed to use it on my localbitcoin service however they only take the reload , not the debit.

Thanks for that suggestion - I just did that , the company states it will take up to 60 days for everything to work out , which is fine for me but still , would have rather had the BTC lol

No - I initially wrote to the seller after 24hours and asked for a confirmation that he had received my payment - which I had already knew he had as it had cleared both paypal and the card company as completed and not just processing. The seller did not respond so I sent a message to the seller's private email , still no contact. 36 hours latter I sent another message asking if the seller would simply confirm that he had my payment and was going to or is in the process of sending the BTC - still no response. Finally, after making the claim on paypay and no response to that either for 18 or so hours I then wrote and told the seller that if there was no confirmation of transaction I would file criminal charges. Still no response. In the past , when I have bought from sellers on Ebay there would always be contact during the transaction process so this is what alerted me that something was not right. The seller had two negative comments which stated no BTC was sent however the seller had much more positive than negative and I know there are complaints in every business so thought it would be worth a try. So you see - if I give you $100 and you tell me "see ya in 2-3 days" but I call you to see how things are going and you intentionally ignore me - yea that's real good - yea no need to be suspicious wtf was I thinking lol

Dude , I made a bad call on this guy but I am far from gullible.

lol - I could actually excuse that then lol

I only wish that were the case , but if it were he/she would have responded to my emails /messages/etc that were sent over a 4 day period. There really is no sense or excuse in outright ignoring your buyer like that. The seller is listed as being active since 2010 and has a decent amount of positive feedback however those two negative that were made within the past few months should have alerted me. The cops told me they really had no doubt it is a scam and even when they get the person it is highly unlikely I will get my $100 back so - I figure it up to experience and just move along. Every mistake is a teacher IMHO.
