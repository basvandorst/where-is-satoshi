Well, we can employ any testing and standards we want. 
I half made the comment as a joke but I have been contemplating creating a free hardware network myself using raspberry pi's and other single board computers.
Essentially, since hardware prices are plummeting thanks to products like the raspberry pi, the giver of the "free" hardware would eat the initial cost but the hardware would be permanently removed from the profit motive market by using contracts with conditions of use and future exchange. 
Basically, the rule would be once gifted a piece of hardware, the recipient could only give it away on a first come, first served basis (along with any improvements made to it) once they no longer had a need for the device. 
And exchanges could be recorded and tracked online so that a limit of one of each device per real person could be ensured. 
And of course people would be encouraged to build their own "free" computers and add them to the free hardware network all the time.

But what if a lot of people become very rich should bitcoin's price skyrocket? At that point, lots of people are going to feel rich enough that they can use some Bitcoin for more and more purchases if their wealth isn't severely threatened by doing so. At that point bitcoin's price might start to stabilize. 
In other words, once Bitcoin reaches a high enough price, there will be more and more people able to both use one half of their Bitcoin as a store of value and the other half as a currency for purchases, just as we do today with money.

I am by no means a Bitcoin expert - I only learned about Bitcoin in 2015-- but I'll take a stab at an answer.
There is much concern and hand-wringing over which cryptocurrency will prevail.
However, you can already trade one crypto for another already and that ability will only increase over time....making coins basically interchangeable with each other.
How can one interpret that?
Well, if you use one popular website on the internet do the other popular websites go away?
Mostly, no because your selection of which website to use is based on the different capabilities of the different websites and your preferences.
Now imagine Bitcoin is one of these early websites on the young Internet.
Is it going to have problems and hiccups in the early stages? Yes. Are those problems and hiccups going to get fixed over time. Probably.
But you might be thinking- "But what if, in the meantime, Bitcoin falls behind another cryptocurrency in popularity?"
Well, here's what websites and cryptocurrencies have in common.
Because you can convert one cryptocurrency into another, in a way, you can treat all cryptocurrencies as just different versions of the same cryptocurrency. Just like you can move your usership from one website to another. 
In other words, depending on what you want to do, you may rely on one cryptocurrency for one activity and another cryptocurrency for a different activity and shuffle your coins between them depending on what you're trying to achieve. 
It's all cryptocurrency. 
Thus, instead of eliminating each other, cryptocurrencies may very well work together in a complimentary manner, just as websites shuffle users between each other depending on the preferred activity.
And as the current leading crypto, Bitcoin, like any leading website, can still be expected to exist just like one of these websites with its own special features and capabilities. 
Should Bitcoin's leading status start to change--assuming it can reach a certain level of dominance -- you'll have time to reassess your allegiance and convert most of your value to other more popular cryptocurrencies. 
But more likely, Bitcoin will remain a popular crypto and the other cryptocurrencies will cover for the things that Bitcoin cannot do well.

The point is to raise it just enough to make a good profit while still being an acceptable price to enough people. Of course, you're still disregarding the fact that, instead of spreading new technology, it's contracting it since by raising the price you are taking that technology out of the hands of people who now can't afford the price.
That is not progress. That is going backwards.

No. I've said nothing about the functionality of "Bitcoin Cash". 
I've only spoken to the tactics of its community.
And you might notice that - unlike Roger Ver- Bitcoin advocates aren't on TV waging a PR campaign against BCH adoption.
They simply disagree with the BCH approach. 
What Ver and his community are doing is hurtful to all cryptocurrency adoption in general at a time when  cryptos are most vulnerable to being rejected by the public.
Now is not the time for cryptocurrencies to compete with each other but to take a wait and see stance. Different approaches should be allowed to play out without being knocked before mass adoption.

It's so much better the way capitalist greed will surely lead to more people losing access to Internet because they can't afford it just like the millions who had to drop cable tv.
It's so wonderful that more of us will be unable to use and access life-changing technology because the ISPs and cable companies just want to be greedy dickheads. Oh, I love freedom!
All this great technology and human innovation and you can't even enjoy it because you're too poor or the corporations are too intent on playing bait and switch with the best content. 
I just love capitalism and living under the constant threat of simple joys and innovative tech being hidden away behind yet another pay wall!
And now we have to worry about Bitcoin being threatened. Will the joys of capitalism ever end?
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:32:10


I guess you consider it progress if less people have internet access because of bad contracts they don't want to sign?
The cable companies did the same thing. Lots more people had cable access and then the rates were raised and now lots of people go without cable.
Seems to me that's not progress. That's going backwards. 
We have all these technologies that many can't even enjoy or use because access is constantly threatened by greed. 
I guess we'll just go back to radio and fireside chats at this rate.

Yes but I really don't have any animosity to the "Bitcoin Cash" approach to how their coins works. It's their PR tactics that trash another cryptocurrency before its approach has played out that earn my objections.
And before a "Bitcoin Cash" advocate replies, allowing one side in a debate to fork when you disagree is not the same as going on tv and reddit and completely trashing those who disagree with your approach.
If the "Bitcoin Cash" approach proves to be the key to mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, I'm fine with that.
Just let the current Bitcoin approach play out before you say it won't work. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. How do you know either way?
Cryptocurrencies are still relatively young.

Just pay your taxes. If you bought your Bitcoin while a citizen of a country with a tax policy, you're legally obligated to pay taxes.
I imagine there is a legal way to avoid paying taxes by buying a yacht, renouncing your citizenship and buying Bitcoin while a non citizen living in international waters. 
People are convinced democratic governments are tyrannical but they are not really that bad. There are legal ways to do things if you comply by the rules. 
Is it convenient? No. But at least you live in a country that gives you that option and you should honor your obligations to a country that offers you that option. 
If you bought your Bitcoin while a citizen, you should pay your taxes on them.
If you don't want to pay taxes on income you earn in the future, have the honesty and guts to go through the legal process of legally renouncing your citizenship and learning how to live on a boat. 
That's what that option is there for. 
The IRS is not the bad guy. They don't pick where tax money goes. They're just people collecting revenue that-- when properly used-- holds this nation together. 
We need government. Government can help with Bitcoin adoption. I'd rather the government get their cut than the private banks. 
It's the private banks we don't need. 
The citizens should work with government to cut the banks out of the loop.

I understand the blockchain needs to keep track of each Satoshi but I think the owner of the coin should have been given the ability to consolidate their own coin within their wallet for free and send that information out to the network. There should be some automatic way the network can know that these coin are now located in a single wallet and should be treated as such until separated with in a transaction at their owner's choice.

If politician's were smart they'd allow Bitcoin to eliminate banks. Right now politicians serve two masters--- the banks and the people...both with opposing agendas. 
They can't please one without angering the other. This leaves a politician's job always threatened by either losing money from banks or votes from the people.
If you allow the people to manage their own money, all you have to worry about as a politician is pleasing the people. You can forget about the banks. That gives you much less to worry about as a politician.

The kid has got a point. A selling point of bitcoin was lower transaction fees.

Ok. Thanks! Trezor it is then!

I just transferred my bitcoin from the ios bread wallet to trezor. I thought it would be an overwhelming process. It wasn't. Now my bitcoin is safe and I feel much better.
You don't have to worry about calculating fees when you're ready to transfer your bitcoin to a hardware wallet. Bread does that for you. 
There was only one hiccup in setting up my trezor and that didn't matter because there was no bitcoin in it yet.
After downloading the trezor bridge for firefox, I went to the trezor website, clicked on "wallet" and plugged my trezor into my computer as instructed by the website.
The first time, the trezor website didn't detect my trezor.
But I didn't panic. I unplugged my trezor, shutdown my computer, rebooted, went to website a second time, plugged in my trezor and it immediately detected it. 
So don't panic if you run into a small glitch. Remember you'll just be setting up an empty hardware wallet so you can make mistakes and start over if you have to.
The actual transfer of my bitcoin from Bread to Trezor went off without a hitch.
I did an initial test send of around $10 worth of bitcoin and, when that worked, I sent the bulk of my bitcoin in the following transaction.
Note: Use Bread's QR reader like I did to read the Trezor receiving QR code address on your computer screen. It assures you won't make any mistakes from either copy &amp; pasting or typing in the address.

I guess i knew that. Just dreading the process. When you moved yours did you doing it in pieces or one fell swoop?

Wait a second...so you're telling me if we implement this example Crypto mining can now claim it won't contribute to climate change by burning fossil fuels?
Is that what you're telling me???

What I want to know, is given the number of Bitcoin wallets out there, how easy would it actually be to download a new wallet, type in any 24 words, and get someone else's Bitcoin restored to your wallet?
Especially if the number of wallets keeps growing.

Why not just etch the words in some kind of stone plaque? I'm pretty sure stone doesn't burn or melt.

Guaido has won no election whatsoever. He is part of a u.s. backed coup and is trying to overturn a legitimately elected government. He is a POS and deserves no help at all.

If you buy from an online exchange or anyone else using the same user ID, they can infer how much Bitcoin you have.

Venezuela's elections have been monitored by international election watch groups and have been deemed some of the cleanest in the world. You are being told lies. 
The only reason those democratic nations reject the legitimacy of the election is because they are allied with the United States, whose national security advisor, John Bolton, is a known war hawk and has publicly admitted to wanting control of Venezuela's oil. 
There is so much lying going on by the United States government on this it is not even funny.
Ask yourself does it even make sense when we ally with Saudi Arabia, which is essentially a total dictatorship but harass Venezuela, which is only trying to make itself into a version of Scandinavia? 
It's about access to oil and the United States bullying its neighbors to the south. Wake up.
Notice also how Scandinavian countries (European) can experiment with elements of socialism all they want but Spanish-speaking countries in the Western Hemisphere are not allowed as if the United States owns them.
There's protests in France too, btw. 
According to the United States it's only a democracy if it aligns with imperialism.

I don't care if he's wrong. It's totally understandable if he breaks his promise. I don't care what anybody thinks. I don't want someone doing that to themselves.
