Looks like it should be burninating the countryside.

I think this is what you're referring to: [link](
They seem quite good in terms of power efficiency, but you're still only getting about 330MH/s which is about the hashing power of a mid-range ATI card. To throw some rough numbers out, at the current difficulty and hash rate, you'll probably earn about .01BTC ($1.20 USD) per day. If you ignore power costs (which most people shouldn't) that's still around 200 days just to make back the initial investment. Add onto that the impending addition of approximately 39TH/s of hash rate from the Avalon ASICs that recently shipped ( [link]( ) and your profits drop to approximately .0066BTC ($0.80 USD) per day. Of course, the most significant variable in this equation is whether you think the value of BTC will skyrocket or not.

My name in there is Massif. I must have signed up just before they closed registration! :D

I can't wait for the episode of Law and Order: SVU where they try to explain bitcoins to the masses. :P

The benefits of buying shares in ASICMINER over buying an equivalent amount of mining hardware is that:
A) the hardware will certainly depreciate in value, especially if it used solely for bitcoin mining whereas shares can rise in value
B) you don't have to pay the electricity bill for ASICMINER shares

I got a bit of a rocky start mining on my laptop at 2MH/s for a day. After that I switched to my gaming PC but still only an nvidia card. About 140MH/s which gets me about .005/day. I earned about .03 in those 6 days.

The one I bought was 0.025749BTC. I think it was cheaper yesterday but I didn't have enough then.
