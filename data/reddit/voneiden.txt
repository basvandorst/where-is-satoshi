The server can provide the client a new random salt to be used on every subsequent login after initial registration. That way the same hash will never be used to login.
Or is this a bad approach?

Bitstamp is fine. Your link is just an example of Bitstamp doing its best to comply with money laundering laws. In terms of past performance Bitstamp has a decent track record. 
Localbitcoins is having a bit of operational difficulties at the moment, but if the site starts to work properly again consider looking for European exchangers instead of just local ones - filter [advertisements by SEPA payment]( There are plenty of reliable sellers. Most of the professional sellers require you to reveal information about yourself, again to comply with the EU money laundering laws and to keep scammers at bay.

Thanks for the reply


Let me elaborate. This method however exposes the salt to the client (however as you point out, since rainbow tables aren't really an issue for SHA-512 does it matter that much?):
* When client registers an account to the server, the server sends the client a unique salt. The client does something like sha512(password + uniquesalt).hexdigest() and returns the result to the server.
* Next time the client attempts to login, the server sends a matching unique salt (based on account name) and a random salt to the user. The user does **sha512(sha512(password + uniquesalt).hexdigest() + randomsalt).hexdigest()** and returns the result to the server. The server can compare the result to sha512(passwordhash+randomsalt).hexdigest()
Of course, if the initial registration hash is intercepted then all is in vain as the MitM can give a correct answer to all subsequent login/session requests. I guess this is just a form of pre-shared key authentication.
I wrote one demo site with similar concept some time ago. In addition to the above, it required the client to do some bitcoin style proof-of-work according to server defined difficulty. Hardly a practical solution of course, just a fun demo.
Edit: bolded part
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:00:43
I'm terribly sorry, there was a silly error in my previous post. I corrected it. 
I also made a small demo:  (edit: you can keep hitting enter to see the randomness in action)
The server will kill itself once hundred accounts are created to avoid running out of memory in case someone decides to spam the shit out of it.
Bottom line: If the MitM did not capture the initial registration that is done only once per user, they are left only with the option of bruteforcing the user password.. 
.. except that isn't the MitM able to inject code as user loads the page? That code could then grab the plaintext password before it's hashed.. Eh.

A bit outdated, but anyway: 
It doesn't answer your question exactly. Whats stopping them? Good faith or Greed? Both? Many of them gave bitcoins to their friends to spread the word in the beginning. And finally, if you were given a change to be the emperor of a great empire, would you empty the royal chambers of gold, leave the empire in turmoil and run away or.. would you expand your empire to become the most powerful the world has seen, lasting for generations to come?
That got a bit out of hands. :-D But I suppose there's no definitive answer. You can only speculate the reasons and motives of those who hold significant amounts.

1. If it becomes a real threat to Bitcoin at some point, I'm sure the situation will be handled appropriately.
2. Trading inside exchanges: instant. Sending bitcoins through the blockchain: average of 10 minutes/confirmation. Usually 3-5 confirmations required. Real world currency to bitcoins takes generally as long as real world bank transfers take.
3. Good luck!
4. The problem might be more Mt. Gox dominating the exchange market leaving upstart exchanges with tiny trade volumes.

There was mention that the attacker gained root access to the servers. How this could have happened?
* Root logins allowed over ssh, password guessed/leaked (unlikely..)
* User password (ssh) guessed/leaked, malicious software installed on user account (keylogger for example) and root password is retrieved that way
* Networking user process exploited to gain user access to do the above
* Networking root process exploited to gain root access
Am I missing something? So some basic precautions everybody dealing with bitcoin services (well, hell, any online service) should do would be
* Disable root logins over ssh
* Use a strong root password
* For user file access, make as much as possible read/execute-only. The less a malicious user has the ability to do writes, the better. No secretly edited payout scripts.. no keyloggers in .bashrc..
Anyone got any more tips, ideas?

It doesn't prove the identity of the receiving end, per se. Mt. Gox however uses EV SSL which also displays the company name next to the lock.

Bitcent or centibit(coin)? That's the question. Bitcent sounds natural (since cent suffix is commonly used in currency), but using that form you can't really go smaller than bitmill. Bitmicro? If one eventually has to jump to SI units, might as well stick with SI prefix from the beginning.
    1 BTC = 1 BTC
    1 dBTC = 0.1 BTC
    1 cBTC = 0.01 BTC
    1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC
    1 µBTC = 0.000 001 BTC
    1 satoshi = 0.000 000 01 BTC = 10 nBTC = 0.01 µBTC
                    
Bitcents sound fine as they are but get awkward immediately when talking about smaller amounts..  IMO. As time progresses the smaller amounts become more relevant..

Hah, user data is rarely encrypted. With your average user you gotta be able to make an easy password reset, and encrypted data would make this a bit complicated.

If they were local servers they could reset the password temporarily for testing purposes.

Presumably most early adopters joined Bitcoin for the ideology, not money (after all, it was nearly worthless at that time). On how many bitcoins are they sitting, that's hard to know. The really lucky ones were those who bought bitcoins and forgot them for a year or two, like .
There was recently [a thread]( which had a list of the top 500 addresses that contain most bitcoins. About half of those addresses had done no transactions in 2013, which implies that they are either forgotten, lost or just being in some really cool headed cold storage.

Some people have sent bitcoins from their paper wallet using Electrum, expected the remaining bitcoins (=change) to stay on their paper wallet, and then deleted Electrum without having backups of the seed nor electrum.dat.
Result: Their paper wallet is empty and the bitcoins they thought that should have been on the paper wallet are now locked forever on a change account that nobody can access.
As long as you keep everything (your paper wallet private keys and Electrum (electrum.dat and the seed text)) well backed up, you're not going to lose anything.
Just remember that if you transfer any amount of money out from your paper wallet with Electrum, ALL the money will be out from your paper wallet. Of course, if you don't mind the tiny amount of transaction fees, you can transfer the BTC manually back from the change address to your paper wallet.
Feel free to keep asking, if it still sounds confusing. :-)

That's kinda what I was wondering too. It's risky business, of course. Obviously the 25k is not the volume of DDoSers, their market share is probably considerably smaller. Say, one or two thousand bitcoins. 
Being able to dump at ~$125 and buy back at ~$115 already profits with 1000 BTC some $10000 (minus fees and botnet). I don't know what size botnet one needs to bring Mt. Gox down to its knees, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't have to be too big. And it's not that expensive to rent a botnet.
Also worth noting that Bitstamp traded nearly 10k BTC during the DDoS and the lowest price was $101.
Of course it's possible the attackers expected a far larger swing and did not succeed in their attempt. All I know is that I made a nice profit of it.

That's right. If you use Electrum to send those 10 BTC, that's right. 5 BTC will end up at your recipient and 5 BTC will end up in your Electrum change address.
On the technical side of this issue, in the bitcoin protocol all the BTC on an address is used as an input for transaction. It's up to the client to decide whether the change should be returned to a new address (=change address) or to the original address.
Example of such "change address" transaction:

MultiBit does the above, returning the change to the original address.

We have a 500 fold increase in mining equipment efficiency? Free money for everyone? Nope! We're gonna have a 500 fold increase in network speed!
Suddenly we find ourselves paying the same electric bill for the same amount of gain as we got during the GPU mining days. The only difference here is that we made a huge capital investment into the hardware. And those people who were expecting to make a quick profit are going to panic.

No problem. So is that picture from now?
Mining reward is issued when a valid block is found. If you are solo mining, you're essentially racing to find a block before anyone else does so on the bitcoin network during the average 10 minute span it takes to find a single block. GUIMiner should (don't know for sure) interface with your bitcoin-qt client so, that if a block is found and you're solo mining, the reward is delivered to your wallet.
With your current speed (414000000 hashes / second) and the current network difficulty it takes an average of 200 years to find a block.
What people tend to do, is to utilize mining pools, where pool works together to find a block. When a block is found, everyone who contributed to the search gets rewarded. This allows steadier income for you. With your current speed and the network difficulty you could be making 0.01 bitcoins minus pool fees a month. Minus electricity, hardware wear and downtime.
Mining is serious business these days. To be competitive on the mining market it takes some serious capital investment to buy proper mining hardware.

Considering the first bitcoin purchase was for one pizza for 10000 BTC, you're somewhat right.
All coins are traceable, you can't just inject money from nowhere into an address and have it accepted by the rest of the network. But there would not have been need to do so in the early times - it was very easy to generate coins in the beginning so all the early adopters got a lot of those.

It's been around pretty long on the Bitcoin-timescale, it's the biggest exchange operating in EU under UK law and more than likely under really close watch of authorities. Sure, sometimes companies go belly up, but everybody can and should make their own decision on what to trust and what not.

Wait, 25k trade and price bounce from $125 to $110 is a failure? That's a 11% max profit on Gox (and up to 19% on Bitstamp).

If you're mining with a pool, the profits should eventually appear on your pool account page, from which you can withdraw then to your multibit wallet.
Other coins need coin-specific software. Some pools support multiple coins.
Bitcoin-qt (  ) is the official client which downloads the whole blockchain on your computer. No need to use it if you're mining in a pool. Some people prefer it for security reasons, however it's really heavyweight application.

Change address is explained on the [Electrum wiki page]( but here we go anyway;
When you make a transaction from address A to B, a new address C (change address) is created. B receives the transaction and C receives whatever would have been left on A after the transaction.
This applies to imported keys too, so if you import your paper wallet, which contains, say, 10 BTC, and make a 5 BTC transaction to someone, beware, your paper wallet is now empty and the remaining 5 BTC is in the electrum change address - this means if you lose your electrum.dat file and don't have the seed written anywhere you lose the "change".
Has happened to people.

HOLD it. What happened? Could you explain the procedure you went through with slightly more detail?
A wallet is not a address. A wallet is a collection of private keys. Addresses are public key representations of those private keys. A valid private key is required to access any balance on an address.
A wallet is usually managed automatically by some software. What software did you use? Where did the address come from if not from the software?

@_date: 2013-04-22 17:40:52
Not perfectly, I left room for error. There are many assumptions here nevertheless. Did they expect the market to rebound? Did they buy in on Bitstamp during the DDoS while the prices bottomed (easier) or did they buy on Gox after the DDoS (risky)? 
The point is, if the goal was to dip the price for $20 and then rebound, it was highly succesful.
If the goal was to dip the price below $100, then it was a miserable failure.
Who knows. I wouldn't call it an outright failure.

If I was you, I would consider cashing out some sum to make a nice backpacking trip. Because we never know when it's too late to do so. Most people regret things they didn't do, not things they did. BUT, you need to make this decision to yourself. Make a decision that you're least likely to regret as you grow older. There's always time for work.

Interesting. What makes you assume miners of today are in for the coins and not quick cash? This really feels like a gold rush all over again. Numbers:
* 2011.04.01: ~1 TH/s
* 2011.08.01: ~16 TH/s
* 2011.12.01: ~9 TH/s
But the money involved in the process in 2011 is nothing compared to what it's now. Mining was largely done with existing hardware (especially the so called 'gamer kids'), whereas now huge amounts of money is poured into hardware. The impact of mining profitability collapse could be something completely different than it was in 2011. 
Of course, I'm simply speculating. Current numbers:
* 2013.1.1: 21 TH/s
* 2013.4.1: 58 TH/s 
* 2013.8.1: 276 TH/s
* 2013.8.24: 549 TH/s
This is not sustainable growth if you ask me..

Can't you include the transaction to the block without broadcasting the transaction to the network? Find block, include unbroadcasted transaction, broadcast block.

Hot wallet actually refers to any wallet that's connected online, encrypted or not, doesn't it? Anyway, if the attacker has root access, getting the encryption key to the wallet is just a matter of time. 
And most bitcoin services keep their bitcoin reserves on hot wallets since they need to be able to transfer them quickly.
I guess a good idea would be for every service to keep a considerable portion of their bitcoins in cold storage - even if it increases the risk of slower withdrawals to customers. But of course, this needs to be communicated with the customer appropriately. 
Extra problem is, that the service needs to transfer the bitcoins from hot to cold through the blockchain, which means transaction fees, doesn't it? If  big sums are involved, that's not a problem, but for a startup business it might cut considerable amount from the profits.
Interesting stuff. If anyone else has info on how other sites have been hacked so far, I'd be really interested on hearing more.

With P2P traffic that can pass over Tor, SSH and VPN tunnels I'd dare say blocking is out of the question. However couldn't this create a bottleneck (in terms of latency) in bitcoin network synchronization between China and the outside world which could in turn lead to more forks? Especially considering that they got a lot of mining power these days.
