or people could ya know actually be decent humans and give the rest of us a chance.
js it's kind of shitty to be dismissive to people who would love to support and tell them to fuck off

what cheap coins? every coin alt i've looked into still needs pretty sturdy equipment to get a hold of. i'm no trust fund baby, i have a 10 year old mb so tell me again how i can profit?

no man it's cool, i appreciate blunt honesty over anything, i admit fault to some degree but i just wish there were better opportunities for us that can't mine or low income

that's kind of a shitty attitude tbh who are you to say what i do and don't need or whether or not i'm "strong"
I think the whole idea and purpose of Bitcoin got lost a long time ago, wasn't it supposed to be for all people and kind of a screw you to banks etc?
but continue to hold those coins and call the people who didn't ride the btc dick wagon train "losers" or "weak" that'll look great on an already toxic community

**honestly how do I get it on limited income?**
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:27:43


it's not possible with little to no income, I can't make the choice of crypto vs if I'm going to be eating ramen for a month

people can't enjoy Bitcoin because of the attitude of early adopters or people who hold a decent amount, I didn't learn about it until 2011, personal circumstance prevented me from investing at all, and GPU mining was on its way out.
And no I'm not bitching, Im just frustrated that I honestly thought this coin was kind of a stick it to the man everyone join in type thing and it's turned into what it has.

the problem is think of all the good you could be doing one person or a group by not just hoarding BTC, for instance say I wanted to start up a business and it ends up successful, there obviously would be some ROI there. Or for people like me who, are disabled and living a very poor lifestyle that need a break. Wouldn't that make anyone feel good?
I guess that's my biggest problem, I really thought this was something everyone could get into, but unless you've been in since day one that's not gonna happen.

LMAO at the downvotes, thanks ladies and germs you've just...Kind of proved my point here.
\&gt; Share blah blah communism
No no friend, that isn't my intention at all. But for so long I remember people wishing more integration from BTC, so why not help others out? 
\&gt; Great idea send btc address
Ha ha ha....you did miss the part where I don't own any because I jumped on this clown train late right?
\&gt; Produce something of value
So what did the people who got in early produce? Their computers? I mean seriously, how can I take that sentence seriously? What did \*you\* produce? I'm saying, early adapters and people who can afford the high powered machines got in first, the difficulty got harder and now even alt coins are hard to mine. 
Listen all I'm saying is, people are acting like the banks that nobody trusts anymore. "HODL" etc is stupid, I'm not telling people to pump everything they have into someone elses btc addy but why not share? Why not help someone out? Why not get more people into it? You can't mine anymore, you can gamble and in some off chance \_maybe\_ make a buck or two, so why not?
