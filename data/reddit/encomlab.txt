Spot on - the elephant in the room is that Visa uses the electrical equivalent of 50k houses to process it's billions of yearly transactions, while blockchain is using as much electricity as Ireland to clear a fraction of that number.  Blockchain is energy capped and will never become widely used because of that fact.  It's like saying a new toothpick company that makes a single pick per tree is going to suddenly revolutionize the financial system.

If you want to play with coins that are actually based on fundamentals you should be in Forex - no significant currency is going to collapse overnight.  Then again, it's not going to skyrocket overnight either.  All investing is, to some extent, gambling - and in general the larger the risk the higher the reward.  What makes bitcoin exceedingly dangerous is that it is not a commodity or fiat currency, nor is it an asset outside of itself.  It IS a limited quantity item that individuals will purchase with fiat and/or commodity currencies at this time.  How long that remains true is yet to be determined, but anyone who says there is no chance of it falling to zero is delusional.

Sure they can - but Bitcoin is not a currency, and it could be argued it's a "product" but only in the way that any other collectable may be.

I think you misunderstood my point entirely.

It's the standard Bitcoin dichotomy - we want BTC to be a currency so the price needs to stabilize, but we want BTC to be an investment so we need the value to rise faster than inflation.
Well you can't have it both ways - a currency with a fluctuating valuation will never be accepted in regular business transactions as it makes it hard to predict what your actual earnings and margins will be.  An investment vehicle will never be widely accepted unless its value is steadily increasing.

Cute.  So explain how a single BTC - a token - is *not* a Cryptocurrency?

[The silicon valley of hardware]( explains this fact far better than I can here.  Shenzhen is where the future happens - the items produced there are what will become the "must have" tech in the EU and US a year later.  Commerce there moves lighting fast, with development cycles that are counted in days or weeks instead of months or years.  Bang out a prototype on your laptop in a cafe, send the gerbers to a local board house and the CAD files to any of countless machine shops or 3D printing businesses running in converted market stalls or shops.  By the time you cycle the few kilometers to each your items are ready and by the end of the day you are testing and pitching it to dozens of manufacturers desperate to have the next breakthrough item on Alibaba.  Hit the night scene, dream for a few hours, wake up - rinse - repeat.  
It is the city that coined the Chinese entrepreneurial mantra of "at 10 I bought my first bicycle, at 20 a car, at 30 a company and at 40 a jet."  No where else on the planet is so much talent, production equipment and the infrastructure to leverage both so concentrated.  They don't care about what currency you use - bitcoin, Ruble, Shekel, USD, Euro - it all spends.

Thank you the excellent reply - and for the clarification on the conversion of value from one type to another.  I've traded Forex for a long time, and there is a similar effect in that trades resulting in a return are taxable, but the rise in value of a currency while it is held is not - until it converted to something else.
The reason I find this stance concerning is that, as you point out, there is some fluidity of definition and none of this has really been hashed out through the courts yet.

This is by no means a valid comparison - the reason the collapse was predicted was due to the lack of inexpensive servers, problems with the way in which connections to the primary phone trunk lines were handled and the expense of consumer grade networking gear.

@_date: 2018-06-07 14:37:28
I find his statements troubling in that he goes on to say that
 "A token, or a digital assets used in a fundraising process known as an initial coin offering, or ICO, are securities by Clayton’s definition.  He said there will be no adjustment of the rules for initial coin offerings and Clayton underlined that tokens or digital assets used in that fundraising process are securities."
Isn't this the same as saying that USD is not a security, but dollar bills are?

The very fact that somehow this seems like a relevant argument in favor of BTC speaks volumes about how *irrelevant* BTC is rapidly becoming.

@_date: 2018-06-07 16:06:15


It is the conversion to fiat that is the transaction that causes the return (or loss) and is the actionable item that creates tax liabilities or an opportunity for a reduction against other liabilities.  That is what caught a number of BTC traders in trouble last year - they converted to USD and realized a taxable return without understanding why.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:26:33

 “A token, a digital asset, where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture, and in return for giving you my money I say ‘you can get a return’ that is a security and we regulate that,”SEC Chairman Jay Clayton told CNBC Wednesday in a report by Kate Rooney. “We regulate the offering of that security and regulate the trading of that security.”
So if there is a return it is a security?  Way too much attention to the cherry quote and not enough to the others he made.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:41:49
How would this impact a premined currency vs. a non-premined currency?  Obviously a miner who generates a digital asset (token) only realizes a return when it is converted into a sovereign currency - is that different than the return an organization issuing a premined ICO gains?  What if the return is handled via crypto and is never converted to a soverign currency - at what rate would the SEC calculate that return?  Again, it sounds like the SEC is trying to have it both ways.  Crypto is a currency when we want it to be and a security when we want it to be.
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:58:30
Thanks - that is helpful.  Its not wrapping my head around the differences as much as how mining and the creation of new BTC is differentiated: If I mine a BTC I have an object of value - not sure how the term asset does not fit here - and if I convert it to USD it will create an actionable liability.  In fact, the entire reason for investing money and time into mining is the goal of generating a return.  So its not quite black and white - I may not pay Satoshi $$ but I do invest time and currency (of some form) with the purpose of generating income.
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:15:51

Moore's law effectively died when Apple went to a 10nM manufacturing spec. Any smaller and your traces are moving into the electron fields of their neighbors.  On the flip side,  a recent MIT study determined that quantum computers may not be scalable beyond a few dozen qubits as the processing required to track decoherence rises exponentially and eventually consumes all available task space. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:50:16
It is- and experimental transistors as small as 3nM were created as far back as 2006. A 1nM transistor was shown to function in 2016 - the problem is obtaining reliable integration at that scale, which is yet to happen outside of the lab.  Beyond that Moore's law dictates a doubling of transistors, something that has not happened in over a decade.

The primary problem with this analysis is the use of data derived from market assets with intrinsic value (stocks, national currencies, bonds, commodity assets) to predict the performance of a collectable without any intrinsic value (digital currencies, beanie babies, baskets, baseball cards, comic books).  The volatility itself is precisely the hallmark of a collectable bubble - a bug not a feature - that may be exploited for great gain or suffered through at great loss.  To apply market analysis to Bitcoin as one would to Oil (commodities) or shares of Apple (stock) or Tbills (bonds) is to illustrate ones lack of understanding of both the market and the item - not the other way around.

Blockchain will require a HUGE increase in efficiency before it becomes commonplace.  Visa uses the electric consumption equivalent of 50,000 homes (US) to process its billions of yearly transactions.

The biggest obstacle to the adoption of blockchain will be environmentalists not banks.
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:47:37

"According to Network Computing, the VISA network can process more than 80 billion transactions per year or 2,537 transactions per second, using two mirrored data centers, each capable of running the entire network. The larger data center is currently pulling enough power for 25,000 households' daily electricity, so we'll double that to account for VISA's total draw. In 2013, VISA's investor reports say the company processed 58.5 billion transactions.
Working off these (admittedly imperfect) figures, each VISA transaction consumes around 0.0003 household's daily electricity use. That makes Bitcoin about 5,033 times more energy intensive, per transaction, than VISA, at current usage levels. "

@_date: 2018-04-12 14:39:49
What I dislike - and what I am "obsessed with" - is the deeply flawed error of thinking "work" has anything to do with value.  
A fundamental principle of economics is that prices are set by the market (whether the market is 2 people or 2 billion) exclusively.  All the factors of production and acquisition - risk, work, commodities consumed, etc. have no bearing whatsoever on the market price.  This is really econ 101 level of understanding - and the fact that so many players in BC do not understand this is probably what will end up killing it off prematurely.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:29:17


This is one of those laughable assertions that causes people to roll-eyes at BC.  The US gov is not "some random" - it is the cornerstone of social functionality throughout the world.  If the US gov gets to the point where dollars are an issue we will all be facing MUCH larger problems.  Additionally - if there is social breakdown to the point at which dollars are worthless, do you really think the systems NECESSARY for BC transactions will still be online?  The internet, connectivity grids and even electricity will be bigger problems than the exchange of physical currency.  This is reality, not some SyFy channel movie.

There is a fundamental point to remember - WORK != VALUE.  Just because something requires "proof of work" (defined in whatever consumption you want: time, electricity, raw materials) that does not translate into value, nor does lack of "proof of work" translate into lack of value.

Value has only one arbiter and that is what item "Z" someone will give you for item "A".  A 15 second pencil sketch by Picasso will have far higher value than a 40 hour sketch by John Doe.

Again - because the scale of the work required has nothing to do with the value of an item.  There are plenty of "easy and trivial" items that have value, and plenty of hard to produce items with none.  A case of toilet paper has more value to the average person than an iMac or 386PC.

Assuming the scaling problem can be overcome - which is looking ever more unlikely.  Tracking quantum coherence at the qubit level presents an exponential problem - each additional qubit requires a square in power of computational effort to determine.  The 50 qubit IBM machine has significant decoherence, which is why only the 20 qubit machine is in regular use.  Unfortunately, unlike Moore's where it was simply a manufacturing issue, qubit scaling is a First Principles problem which may likely not be solved.

I understand this is a difficult concept - which is why it is so fundamentally ingrained in the community - but you must understand this if you are ever going to successfully invest in anything (crypto or otherwise).  The value of an item is only the exchange rate for something YOU value held by another.  It has nothing to do with production costs, scarcity, security or anything else.  
This fact is precisely why we have markets and exchanges, and why understanding this is how you make (or lose) money from arbitrage.
