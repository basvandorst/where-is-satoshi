I see, thank you. Is there any specific date when this happened? Not sure if I had it at that time.

I was just told by a friend who uses coinbase that he got bitcoin cash at an equal amount of the bitcoin he held. Is this an exclusive thing for coinbase users? I hold bitcoin on bread wallet on ios but I don't see any bch there. That would suck ._.

Was happy to see a game i wanted to buy was purchaseable with btc and when it was time to pay my 54$ was like 17$ or something in fees. May have even been 20. Ruined it and made me just not use btc :( nothing fishy that just sucks

What's your deal with mentioning it tons of times? Jeez.

Does this mean that there won't be a fork or is that another thing? Won't we get free bitcoin cash or whatever now?

When did that fork happen? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:59:28
Ah, yeah I was confused about that. So this was the 2x fork that would also give free coins (bch?) though, right? But now that ain't happening at all huh?

Gotcha. What I don't get is what's so bad about an ios wallet like Bread. On the bitcoin website it seemed like there were only positives mentioned for example.

Sounds great, thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:38:32
Thanks for the info! I think I'll keep it on bread for now and look into a hardware wallet in the future :)

That’s how you’d consider something like Crumb? What’s the main reason for it being unsafe if you dont mind enlightening me?
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:02:13
Gotcha! It's still just some spending money but I will start buying more BTC as my paychecks come in so I will definitely be picking up a hardware wallet then :)
