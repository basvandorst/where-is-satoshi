That’s a wonderful idea, but charitable giving has always been orders of magnitude lower than government spending on welfare or assistance programs. Estimates for total charitable giving in the US for 2018 are between 30-40 billion across all categories. The Gov spent more than 100 billion just running the SNAP program over the same period. 
Unless you can convince everyone to add a couple of zeros to all their charitable donations we’re probably going to have to keep taxing to support the social safety net programs that keep our country safe and healthy. 
Issues of mismanagement and corruption are a problem and we should all work to investigate and fix them, but these problems can happen just as easily in the private sector (especially if we start massively increasing all of their budgets).

Well taxpayers already are paying for it... It just makes sense to let undocumented people get preventative care, which lowers the overall cost to the taxpayer and gives them better healthcare overall.

This is all true, but most user facing computers do not run Linux. So while between 90 and 99% of the worlds computing devices run Linux at least 90% of human &gt; computer interactions happen on a commercial operating system (if you don’t include smartphones).

Back in my day when we wanted to use technology to steal small amounts of money from our university we printed hundreds of blank pages on the university printers and then put the blank sheets in our own printers. 
In the end we only hurt ourselves as our university implemented a printing quota system and started charging additional printing fees with tuition.
Hopefully kids stealing from their college by mining are smarter about it and only mine during the winter months / when the heat is running in their dorms.

That was what almost everyone said when the first iPhone came out. To be fair the iPhone was at least 300 dollars more expensive than any of its competitors and no one outside of apple had any experience of just how good a capacitive touch screen could be on a mobile device. Every on screen keyboard up to that point was a complete disaster.
Balmer might be an idiot, but pretty much the entire world thought the first iPhone would be an expensive niche product and not the revolution it turned out to be.

Overheating or malfunctioning components can cause the cardboard to smolder and combust.

I'd modify this to say something like "the wallet you access with your phone to send bitcoins in person should have no more funds in it then you would be comfortable carrying in cash".
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:23:02
Huh, well how about that. I'm surprised I don't see more places that charge a premium for credit cards then.

Coinbase made an iOS app... It was even in the app store for a bit before it got pulled... Hopefully it will get resubmitted and put back up soon!

major credit cards won't allow businesses to charge less for cash transactions. Businesses caught doing this can loose their ability to process credit cards at all. Most businesses have decided that the extra sales from people who would only pay by card more than make up for the fees incurred. One would imagine that these businesses would take a similar stance on bitcoin payments charging the same amount as cash transactions (especially because the fees are generally much smaller).

The IRS (or applicable government agency) is not going to go proving that someone owns x number of bitcoins in wallet XXXX. They are going to spot and investigate tax fraud the way they always have. Looking for people spending much more money than they are reporting they have earned. Purchasing lots of stuff with your under the table bitcoins, especially if you don't have a large traditional source of income, is a good way to get audited / investigated.

As long as bitcoin fees are cheaper than credit card fees it makes sense to price bitcoin at the same level or lower than the price of the item when paying by credit card. Merchants wouldn't want people to avoid paying in bitcoin because it costs more only to pay with credit cards instead. That would cost the merchant more money in fees. 
As long as bitcoin isn't cannibalizing too many cash sales it makes sense to price it the same (or possibly a bit under) the price of the item when paying via credit/debit.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:24:38
Fair enough... Makes me wonder if as bitcoin is used more and more if small items will start being priced with transaction fees included, or if we'll think of the transaction fees more like a sales tax and just add on the extra bit in our head when considering the cost of an item.

Go ahead and lookup the borders of that 1947 partition plan. If Israel wants to occupy all of the land given to them in that plan, I'm sure they will have plenty of takers on the Palestinian side.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:30:54
The civilians occupying the West Bank is absolutely the issue. Especially when you consider the fact that the land those civilians are occupying previously belonged to a Palestinian family who are most likely living near by and the fact that Israeli Jews living in settlements are governed under civilian law while their Palestinian neighbors live under military law. 
Acts of violence are never justified, but when this shit has gone on for 60+ years you can see how some Palestinians could get pretty fucking pissed.

That depends on the 529. My state gives a tax credit (up to $1000 per year) for depositing up to 5000 in a specific 529 plan. The gains of that particular plan are nothing special, but the guaranteed 20% return through a tax credit is pretty hard to beat!
@_date: 2016-12-30 05:32:06
They aren't expected to put up with it. They are expected to abide by international law and not allow civilians to settle in occupied territory.
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:16:00
I will look into it (although I’m always a bit skeptical when people talk about really high returns without mentioning the risks). I should point out that the 20% on this particular 529 is 20% guaranteed PLUS whatever return the actual account gets, so depending on the year it could be anywhere from 23-30% combined return.

That’s true, but efficiency is a thing... turns out most of the world figured out that it’s more efficient to pay for healthcare that covers everyone through the tax system than it is to have everyone buy their own private insurance and make insurance companies and hospitals negotiate the cost of each procedure. 
Universal healthcare run by the gov and paid for through taxes would be cheaper than the current system in the US because it will take away most of the jobs from medical billing departments in hospitals and private insurance companies. 
Imagine if we had private fire companies and if your house was burning down you would have to get service from an in network fire prevention group, and after the fire be faced with a huge bill that you hope you can get negotiated down to a reasonable rate, assuming the axe the fireman used to break down your door was coded properly in the billing and your insurance company decided this particular type of fire was covered.

I think you mean to say “How does the United States’ population of undocumented people affect our ability to have government provided universal health care?”
To which I would respond “our duty to provide adequate health care to all people residing within our boarders means that a more efficient health care system is even more important. A universal health care system would allow us to focus on caring for each person in need rather than always asking the question “how are we going to pay for that” while also eliminating vast inefficiencies in the medical billing sector. 
Remember hospitals already treat uninsured and undocumented persons through their emergency departments. Universal health care would allow us to treat these people much more effectively and at a greatly reduced cost.”

Anyone know how they did it? Surely it wasn't as simple as just transferring the coins into a wallet they controlled.

Since there are more possible bitcoin addresses than there are atoms in the universe, that is a highly improbable scenario.

Hypothetically imagine that the US dollar was doing very well (use your imagination!) and that 1usd could now buy something that would cost about 100 dollars today. The conversation going on here is similar to the US gov saying that all prices should be switched and listed in pennies rather than dollars. So the dollar menu down at McDonalds where stuff used to cost .01 dollars becomes the penny menu, and everything is 1.00 pennies
This is what is essentially being discussed, except for bitcoin the growth is 10 times greater than my hypothetical situation.
