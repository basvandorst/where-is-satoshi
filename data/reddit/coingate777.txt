electrum is probably the best IMO

Coinbases whole business model is to provide a user friendly interface for people with no understanding of cryptocurrencies. Brain Armstrong has stated this many times over. They are servicing a customer base who has no rational understanding of blockchain protocols and are ignorant to whats happening in the bitcoin world 99% of the time. As a result, they're able to prey on the uninformed and get away with so much garbage simply because their customers don't know any better. 
Quite honestly, they've done an incredible job at it too. They've been able to capitalize on the influx of bandwaggon jumpers in the past few years, and no doubt will continue the trend for years to come as everyone and his brother starts buying bitcoin. Coinbase reminds me of the Goldman Sachs of the crypto industry- from a PR standpoint everyone hates them, but the firm is incredibly successful at what they do. I hate coinbase as much as the next person, but you got to respect the success they've been able to achieve.

I would argue that mentality is far more detrimental.
Outsourcing trust to a third party within a system designed to be inherently trustless completely defeats the purpose of cryptocurrenices. Bitcoin's entire design is centered around financial autonomy. A trustless *cash* system that allows two parties to transact directly without the consent or need for an intermediary party.
By outsourcing control of your money to coinbase, you are essentially replicating the traditional banking systems we already have in our societies. Why even use bitcoin at that point?

Yes LTC currently has higher benefits but its liquidity and adoption rates are a fraction of bitcoin's.
Like mentioned above second layer solutions like Lightening network will allow bitcoin transactions to be propagated without having to be settled on the blockchain. This will increase the speed and settlement times (near instantly) significantly.
However, if adoption and usage keeps growing at the exponential rates we've seen, a block size increase is inevitable even with lightening integration

Even with all those devices combined, its hashrate power is probably equivalent to 1-2 ASICs (don't quote me on that). They'd be far better off mining ASIC resistant altcoins.
However, the PR backlash they'd face if caught (which they would eventually get caught , given the # of users) hijacking peoples CPU's would result in significant financial losses. It would erase any profits resulting from the operation

Yes if the same amount of volume was occurring on LTC it would be more expensive. However bc block intervals are 4x faster I'd imagine it wouldn't be as congested...
Totally agree though , it makes no sense to transact with a coin if an alternative one can do it faster and cheaper. Unfortunately too many numbskulls on here are blinded by herd mentality and can't see that. Store of value is a very important aspect of BTC but its not the only one

What wallet program were you using? 
If its a deterministic wallet that gave you a plaintext seed, you can still recover the funds, even if the .wallet file itself is encrypted

did they give you a list of 12-24 random words and tell you to copy it down when you created the wallet?

I think he means similar to what pirate bay is doing where they hijack your CPU and start mining whenever you're on the site

Looks like Morgan Stanley will be picking up all the bitcoin customers JP Morgan lost....

awesome thanks so much for the detailed response!
