US sliding into techno-corporate authoritarianism.

All systems contain within itself the cause of its demise. The US can't help but abuse its power as the center of the dollar-denominated global financial system. It's fascinating to watch the slow-motion demise of this system as Iran/China/Russia create an alternative.

I do know. It's not at all a broad unfounded assumption. Faith in government has been a bedrock principle of the left since FDR. The left is the branch of social welfare programs, Medicare for all, Bernie and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You don't think Paul Krugman has a deep faith in government? This isn't even close to being controversial. You can be an exception. That's fine. But this is widely accepted and not at all incorrect. 
 
I agree with you on habeas corpus and we probably have a lot in common. But don't kid yourself authoritarianism is on the rise on both sides because the country is collapsing. It sucks. The left's economic policies will lead to additional centralization, dysfunction, and then when people try and leave or escape the system the left will have to resort to authoritarianism to keep them in and prop things up. It has happened repeatedly in history and is playing out right now in Venezuela.

I've found it interesting that Trump's election didn't prompt those on the left in the US to look at Bitcoin. I know they deeply believe in govt and just assume they will eventually regain control of the Presidency and look down on BTC but you would think the election of someone you despise would cause you to question "the system". But I guess that type of thinking is why I'm in BTC and they're not.

Reading his book made me realize how radical BTC is economically. Its tenets are the exact inverse to the beliefs of our current credit-based, inflationary, fiat-based system.

Someone told me economics exists to intellectually justify the existing power structure. So during industrialization you got laissez-faire, after WW2 Keynes to validate the welfare state/government spending and now economists exist to justify the existing global/financial system. It's not a perfect description but it makes a lot of sense.

There are several cyclical theories of debt. But the best for this is Minsky. Minsky says over the life of your debt cycle the type of debt moves from investment to specualtive to ponzi and degrades in quality at each step. Eventually you get too much, the system becomes too fragile, something and people get spooked and you have a crisis. Think 2008 and housing. Everyone thought they were in a period of investment and speculative debt but were actually in overleveraged ponzi finance. In a normal cycle overindebted firms would go out of business, debt would be destroyed either by default or being paid off, and eventually over time the economy would reset to a lower rate of indebtedness before the whole thing starts again. check out this graphic: [ 
But because of the social ramifications and because a lot of rich powerful people would lose tons of money, central banks stepped in 2008 and prevented this from happening. That's why you now have record corporate debt and interest rates basically trapped at 0%. An event that would have marked the end of this debt cycle that started in the early 1980s has instead been extended due to CB intervention.

The marginal return on debt has been declining considerably for the past decade so you need more and more of it per unit of GDP. 
It would likely have already collapsed had it not been for Central Banks. Which is why interest rates are the lowest in recorded history. CBs have allowed for the debt cycle to continue when in earlier market-based eras it would have already blown up by now.

Fascinating Macrovoices podcast with Jeff Snider on the Eurodollar system that dropped yesterday. The tldr is that there is an offshore USD-based monetary system that the Fed is essentially unaware of and exists outside their regulatory view. And this is the system that seized up in 2008 and where all these Dollars went.

I have no idea what that means. Are you talking about the Milton Friedman quip about it? Cause he was clearly wrong.

Don't listen to people blaming the hashwars. The BCH drama might be the trigger but it's not the cause. The Fed is tightening, pulling liquidity and Bitcoin is a risk-on asset. Not a coincidence it surged throughout 2017 as equities also did. Now that the Fed is tightening equities and risk assets like BTC/crypto are selling off. It will remain in its downtrend until the Fed loosens back up. Which could be for several years. The silver lining is that because our financial system is prone to crisis and being indebted, the Fed will eventually load up its balance sheet again.

It depends on how far it goes under and what happens to the rest of the world. If the US is bad but there's still active BTC holding outside it then it'll likely stay more viable. Tough to tell without specific details regarding how much and how the breakdown is.

I agree with inflation and/or default. But devil's advocate is there a scenario in which given the massive amount of US and global debt that we get a debt-deflation spiral that paradoxically props the dollar up? I'm having flashbacks to when the Fed massively increased their reserves in 2008/2009 but high inflation didn't manifest because it was simply filling the money-creation gap left by financial institutions pulling back. Plus, the increase in debt has caused monetary velocity to collapse. Though they were able to restart asset price inflation in equities and RE and credit.

So tough to time this. The Chinese have become seemingly adept at extinguishing these little fires. I was pretty sure their financial sector problems were finally going to manifest in 2015/2016. Nope.

Just as with the announcement regarding Flexa at Whole Foods and Starbucks big retailers are unlikely to directly take BTC in the near future so using services like BitPay will likely be the best we'll get for now. Companies simply don't want to deal with issues around compliance, fees, confirmation times so they offload that onto those third parties.
