Telegram is pretty private by itself, and it doesn't reveal any info about user. The whole messenger is advertised as the most private way to communicate. 
Bot creators might potentially install some log, but its the same way as some block-explorers might log it. In both cases your privacy depends from whether you are revealing some info about your own name or not.
At least Telegram's bot creator won't know your IP. But in order to keep away your IP from your regular address explorer you have to use proxy/VPN/etc
How do you checking addresses then? :)

Trolling? Today everybody is talking about proposed raising block limit to 20 megabytes (MB) (*not 21 MB as the topic says*) very soon.
Other subject: *In 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto projected the Bitcoin system to have inner limit of 21000000 coins that ever will be in existance.* Back to the subject: The proposed 20 megabytes limits isn't connected with 21000000 coins at all. Zero correlation. 20 megabytes is just the future size of blocks. Currently we have 1 megabyte block limit and again it logically doesn't touches the coins limit.
21 MB instead of 20 MB - as the new blocksize limit is just a joke of the author on the topic that maybe we could adjust this indicator to be similar to 21000000 coins for making your face **even more confused** by letting you think that 21 MB = 21000000Bitcoins.

is fucking expensive, don't mention that. Mention a $5 connection, and I'll follow you. Now I understand all Chinese people, Russian people &amp; other people from developing countries. 
They are just disagree when you're mentioning such costs for Internet connection as $40. You have a very expensive Internet there in U.S. But its very cheap e.g. here in Russia. You get loads of bandwidth on that.
Why would you even use DOLLARS instead of megabytes in such technical debates?

You can use CoPay to create digital backing proof. E.g. if you need to trust your intermediary for the amount of $1,000 - he deposits this amount in Bitcoins on 2-2 multisig wallet with coPay. One key is controlled by me, but I don't have access to his funds unless he won't sign my transaction. 
Also my intermediary can't spend without consulting me. Now you can ask such intermediary to be fiscally responsible for something like receiving fiat from a customer.
@_date: 2015-06-28 07:29:14


double spending is almost impossible to do and heavily depends on complicated transaction route, and takes some time to prepare and without guaranteed success. While doing chargeback within 30+ days is very easy with 99% success granted.

in 5 years 1 BTC = $1,000,000
in 20 years 1 BTC = $100,000,000 (because too many Bitcoins at that time will be lost &amp; all powerful people will own Bitcoins at that time which will cause unfair redistribution in Bitcoin wealth &amp; huge greed which will increase scarcity like a million times)
You can't measure future price of Bitcoins by capitalization, because 
1) in future the will be way more capital than it is today - so you always have to multiply this number - because civilization get richer every day even if you're getting poorer; 
2) in future there will be more rich people than it is today;
3) the Bitcoin itself will stimulate liquidity of money &amp; by itself will increase the capacity of markets - because in a free markets there will be more incentive to get richer and HODL tougher.

if you don't get, what I'm talking about, go to  and read their requirements - they ask for Digital Oceans account.
provistor.com - is marketed as the most easiest way to start running openbazaar.
Basically costs of running your OpenBazaar node with provistor.com are $12 yearly for maintaining your 15 stores (automatic setup) + the costs of Digital Ocean account.
This post is not only about the market request, it is about testing OpenBazaar, so I would prefer having it here on &amp; (not because afterwards I would be glad to share detailed review on my experience with provistor.com &amp; what I've done within this shared collaborative experiment.

In that context you was talking about bandwidth's cost.  By offering using "megabytes" I mean megabytes of bandwidth.
E.g. you could say "I could easily purchase 10mbps Internet connection to download 8 mb block within a seconds" instead of saying "$40 worth of bandwidth to download 8 mb block within a seconds".
Idk, imo U.S. standards of living frightens the shit out of Chinese miners. This ends up in reading your bandwidth expectations in dollars, taking this as a manual "from a respective technical expert on U.S. forums" and wondering, how they can afford the Internet lines.
Your bandwidth in U.S. is even more expensive than electricity bills for most of Russian cities for running average mining farm.

Bitcoin is too complicated technology to use it this way. Its like using microsoft word instead of creating .txt document, because its more fancy. The way you want to use it means that some smart IT heads must sit down all weeks long &amp; think how they are going to fit miner fees to correlate it with the transaction size.
For such purposes banks already have their internal database, which is secure enough, because its using the same cryptography. You're messing up the cryptography as a knowledge with decentralized network as a system.

nLockTime basically is the ability to stop your transaction from being included to blockchain **before** specified time. But you must push the transaction to mempool yourself (or in other word you must "send" your transaction to the network for nTimeLocked Bitcoins when time limit is surpassed, because nobody is holding your transaction data for you until the moment came). If you lost that transaction &amp; private key from wallet, you are losing your funds. If you lost your private key &amp; saved your nTimeLocked transaction signature/script you can unlock that transaction because it was already signed with your private key &amp; you're holding the whole nTimeLock script with signature of the transaction. Basically this means that you must hold your transaction information yourself in this case in order to make this future contract work.
With the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY blockchain gets new function: ability to include to blockchain a certain message that will process the transaction in future **without your participation**. So in case if you lost your private key, and also lost your CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY transaction hashes &amp; script, the blockchain is still going to process your transaction in the cloud without your participation at the future date which you specified. In this case even if you've lost transaction information or your HDD crashed/papers burned whatever happened, contract will work anyway &amp; you can't touch this Bitcoins, because they will be locked, almost like frozen for specified moment.
Use cases for CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY e.g. is inheritance - e.g. you can give blockchain programming instruction to release your funds from your wallet in 2040 when you're sure dead &amp; when your children need your money.

Now concensus is something like "Ok, let's keep maximum filesize limit 4gb for current FAT protocol &amp; but soon we will do NTFS hardfork"
What this BIP is offering is like saying "Ok, let's keep maximum filesize limit 4gb for current FAT protocol &amp; but soon we will predict timestamps for our next filesystem protocols - if 75% agree, then maximum filesize will be increased"
If Microsoft / filesystems had such BIP, we would still would be using FAT filesystems.

Wrong. Machines are far more reliable, than humans. You can't make sure something is complete the way you wanted, if you give this task to human. But you can get far more reliability if machine is responsible for the task. Some use cases need this sort of reliability. Nobody is forcing you to lock your coins, its up to your choice.
That's the reason human laws are broken.
That's the reason chargebacks are broken.
That's the reason I don't want people to have access for creation of public money.

Or is there any way to make some sort of merkle tree for a block? I mean as a solution splitting network on 2 or 3 segments with the same blockchain, e.g. miners/nodes who assigned themselves for working on a Segment 1 of transactions, they would gather only their segment transactions &amp; can't interfere with Segment 2 transactions.
e.g. Segment 1 is going to have 950 kbytes sizes of transactions for the next block, and Segment 2 is going to have 850 kbytes sizes of transactions. Both mined independently by 2 different networks of miners, both blocks accepted to a blockchain, but only after Segment 3 high-speed bandwidth miners would merge this 2 segments (for filtering duplicate transactions/double spends)

Some people may decide to not move their significant amounts of Bitcoins for 25-50 years (some people have such time in their life, some people don't - plus it could be not only 1 person, it could be funds of 2 persons combined with 2 lifespans - e.g. dad giving his son the Bitcoins he stored for 25 years, now sons stores this Bitcoins for another 25 years), which is almost equal for your wealth as burning it.

* This is how it would look if you would have this conversation in Russia:
**where can I buy Bitcoin**
Go to LocalBitcoins, but before it you should have QIWI/Online Sberbank/WebMoney or Yandex.Money. *No SSN/bank verification required, anyone can do it with any checks so this part is skipped*
**Ok I'll go there and get BTC ASAP!!! So convenient! How much are the fees??**
average fees are 3% to 6% (everything goes to providers operating on LocalBitcoins.com)
**ok I got the BTC finally now what do they do on the other end after I send it?**
Most often in Russia the Western Union usages is to send money to countries back to families like Kazakhstan, Kyrgistan, Tadjeekingstan, etcStan. All of these countries support QIWI/Online Sberbank/WebMoney or Yandex.Money - you just text them with that.
Bitcoins are very easy for Russians. But even in such environment we have a lots of skeptics who would never do that because in news they said that Bitcoin is bad... So yeah 70% will never use Bitcoin if they have choice to use fiat. They're very often dumb enough to say things like "I would rather pay 10% for convenience with Western Union"

I heard few opinions among my non-Bitcoin friends who was insanely purchasing USD. Now people in Russia started investing their money to USD insanely, because there's no more confidence into our national currency. They don't inveset to Bitcoin, because 99% of our population still think that its ridiculous saving into some weird contraversial game non-existant bubble empty fiat virtual money (that's what they believe what Bitcoin is)
And while coinapult my have a great hedging algorithms, the worse thing that people would want to do - is hedging the ruble (Because ruble became more volatile than Bitcoin)
Maybe people would hedge some USDs but that's sounds lika suspicious tx (Why should I use some unknown service called coinapult to buy a fiat currency backed by cryptocurrency infrastructure - that's how regular person thinks about this)
I don't think that our Russian citizens should put their trust into USDs, because U.S. dollar will have a big problem in a long run.
But right now, wealth is being transferred from our poor country to your wealthy European USD bubble, because people is buying fiat dollars &amp; NOT Bitcoins. That's makes me sad.

Compete with your Bitcoin-friends on how much individual merchants (farmers, service providers, individual sellers) they can bring to accept Bitcoin for the food/service/other essentials everybody could need. Build a local network where you could buy basically almost everything for Bitcoin - once you will bring some merchants to accept Bitcoin you can share their contact data with your Bitcoin-friends so that you both could purchase items from the same merchant. If you have 2 friends who compete on how much merchants they have - then it means that you'll be sharing results &amp; will turn your local economy into Bitcoin at least twice faster, also think - what if you've managed to persuade 4 friends into that deal :) - if 4 of friends search merchants locally who's ready to try new technology, and monthly you find at least 3 merchants, then it means 4*3=12 you already have 12 people who's ready to sell different sorts of products to you locally.

I believe its all about convenience for customers. Customers must be able to see your Bitcoin address everywhere:
1. Bitcoin Address must be available on the hotel's web-site
2. Engrave Bitcoin address somewhere on the wall or make gold metal plates embedded into the tables of the reception, on the eating plates too, so that everybody could see and know this address
3. Print QR codes, but very cautiously because your employees can accept payment to their own QR code when you don't see (e.g. some temporarily empty rooms could be unofficially taken by guests who paid on wallets which isn't owned by your corporation)
4. Educate your stuff. Let them know that Bitcoin is awesome &amp; make sure they understand how transactions go.
5. Not only publish your Bitcoin address on your web-site, but start accepting Bitcoins on your web-site - I can help you create a PHP + MySQL database program for your web-site using Blockchain API which will let your customers pay easily &amp; will easily let your stuff check whether invoices paid or not (the rooms which is paid will be represented on special area in the web-site which shows whether it is paid or not)

the problem with LocalBitcoins.com is that they have a requirement to have 0.4 BTC on your balance to start trading. That's a robbery! Its the same like MtGox would offer you its services only if you have 0.4 BTC as your balance! It is an absurd!
If you're looking at this requirement it sounds like this - why u no give me your Bitcoins? Aren't you trusting us? If you're trusting us we still don't understand why u no giving us your Bitcoins? Then maybe we shouldn't trust you at all (unless you have a 0.4BTC on a balance) and then we won't give you opportunity to sell your Bitcoins

with satoshi I can say that I have 200,000 satoshi, to find out how much I have in terms of 1 BTC, you just have to make a simple math: you know that there is a 7 zeroes in satoshi, so you just get a number 0.00000001 then multiply it -- 0.00000001 * 200,000 = 0.002 BTC. Now you know that you have zero zero zero 2 btc. How you can do the same thing with uBits? No way. Why I should even remember such unimportant things.

Typical response of a person who's Bitcoin non-believer, mostly not even non-believer - he never heard of Bitcoin (not counting few news lines). He's talking about illegal stuff. Does the government making central digital passports &amp; prohibiting people from infrastructure by their central authority is legal? Is countries around the world banning Bitcoin is legal? (Such countries are against people rights.)
Elon Musk for a long time was someone whom I would follow on the Internet &amp; someone whom I would use as an example, now I've found out that I was wrong. This interview is disappointing.

Let's say such thing happened to U.S. which was disconnected from Europe for 3 months since right now.
If were a leader from Bitcoin Foundation, a person who needs to makes choice about what recommendations to give for the users of Bitcoin protocol - what would you recommend for the community? Here's few choices:
1) The problem is that in this case we will have 2 forks - A) American Bitcoin Fork; B) European Bitcoin Fork. The same thing is gonna happen to the American Litecoin Fork &amp; European Litecoin Fork. We will have the duplicate forks for every continent. What if World Wide Segmentation occured, and the Internet is divided on 5 segments? That doesn't sounds funny anymore - it is like having 5 bitcoin forks, 5 litecoin forks, and most importantly - 5 dogecoin forks (and 1000 of other cryptocurrencies will have their own copies of fork). And if event lasts for more than 3 months, then even if all of the Internet segments will get back together, we still gonna have separate forks.
Imagine that before segmentation (separation of networks) you've had 1000 BTC (around $600,000 or half of million dollars) and you live in the United States. After segmentation you will be able to spend your $600,000 in U.S., and since the networks are separated, then you can go to Europe and spend the same amount of money 2nd time. You can buy 2 wonderful houses for such money in two different parts of the world!
But what kind of economical effect will follow such events? If there's 2 Internet segments, or 2 Accepted Bitcoin Blockchains in 2 different countries, then it will mean that those who have their savings in Bitcoin - will be happy about that, because both forks are functional, but how about overall Bitcoin economy? Since the currency is deflationary - it will be just okay to have a copy of the savings accepted to the public.
By the way my question is - since right now - what's stopping me and my team of developers from creation a 2nd Bitcoin fork which represents the whole copy of the current Bitcoin?
Since there's too much people already who's owning millions of dollars in Bitcoin, if 2nd copy of fork will be accepted somewhere, it will means that all of those people will run to that country in order to withdraw their coins into the other assets like gold, real estate, etc - because they in this case won't be sure if 2nd blockchain will be the same acceptable as it is right now.

Talking perfectly I'm expecting DAC for multisig. Right now DAC is utopia, even the central multisig providers are good enough as cruicial solution for next step Bitcoin network capacity. What can go wrong with central multisig provider:
* It can stop/delay your transaction from happening (target user manipulation)
* It can lose your key (server destruction/government/hackers intervention)
** In this case the solution is encrypting 3rd key with software time-capsule solution which haven't implemented anywhere right now (i.e. making 3rd key not available immediately). Third-party provider somehow should make sure that 3rd key isn't available to user because in case if user has access simultaneously to 2 keys - user can cheat with double-spending.
But this 2 points isn't so bad as you may think. If we will have a more choice of wallet providers, it would be great.

Yes, for some reason my blockchain.info at that day showed exactly that number - 23 gigabytes, not sure why, I freaked out that it grows with too fast rate.
Now I see with new numbers - that average transaction size according to current numbers is just 451 bytes or less. But by multiplying 451 bytes on 27 billions daily transactions it still gives the number of 12 terrabytes.
But yeah, probably you're right - that the if size of blockchain grown significantly, that's also means the popularity growth of cryptocurrency and that will help it to overcome the scalability needs by massive campaigns, public attention, etc

that's the point - compare them:

I don't see any difference, except for saying "satoshi" honors Bitcoin's history. Plus its more sustainable in a long run when we will have higher prices per Bitcoin. Gives people incentive to purchase more satoshis.
Would you purchase 200,000 satoshi or 2,000 bits? It would be more motivating for me to purchase first, because it sounds like a lot money.

Cool, didn't expected to receive help in this thread, since this topic had only 5 upvotes when I started reading :) I'm running OpenSuse, and my git clone saying that SSL certificate is wrong...
error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate while accessing 
TL:DR 
Including the fact that I'll have to solve the direct IP problem additional problem with SSL certificates &amp; other Linux hurdles might consume way more time before I"ll get started
Maybe providing OpenBazaar Node LiveCD would help those users which don't have Linux knowledges? I think it would significantly simplify the process of installation for total noobs who usually have unlimited amount of old hardware which could easily pay for ISP &amp; press 1 button during Live CD/DVD boot.
Very often in poor countries poor nerds might have a problem with dedicating computer with working HDD (HDDs are too expensive even for old computers), but I think properly made OpenBazaar LiveCD might even work as LiveCD standalone version: all you have to do 1) Find old computer; 2) Find old CD-ROM; 3) Find old network card; 4) Boot from CD-ROM; 5) Plug-in cable.
That is the steps which everybody can do. I think LiveCD is must have for any project, it helps to overcome human factor.
Too nerdy: Also you it would be useful to consider shared virtual php web-hosting solution as port-forwarding or as a server-side application. The benefits of running server apps on PHP is the fact that you don't have to pay for it: 0. But I suppose OpenBazaar is written in Python and there's no free virtual shared python hosstings.

One of smart person's first reaction to whom I showed bitcoin.org &amp; videos about Bitcoin was "Oh, so small amount of views, screw it - shame on it", and "Oh, this web-site's design &amp; everything on it sucks, so shame on it too".
The worst thing about this person, is that he has capabilities to understand Bitcoin, but he never tries, even though we did pretty intelligent approaches to give him a clue. And most of intelligent people are like that.
And it doesn't matter the quantity of intelligence that people has. Not everybody is mature enough to grasp the ideas behind Bitcoin. The positive thing about it all - is that I'm sharing to everyone I know about Bitcoin for 2 years already and during such small amount of time few of smart people came back &amp; started to ask me more questions, and usually they come back with huge amounts of money ready to invest to Bitcoin industry.

The problem with ntimelock is that you have to keep your raw data for the transaction, and also you must destroy your private key from which you've sent the transaction. You theoretically still have opportunity to double-spend your ntimelocked funds if you haven't destroyed your private key from the wallet from which you've sent ntimelocked funds, because inputs are still belonging to that wallet. Transaction will occur only on the event when nTimeLock raw data will be executed after the specified ntimelock.
I'm think the digital time capsule is greater, because its easier to setup than nTimeLock, even though nTimeLock would be better solution.
The greatest independent solution of course would be combining 2 methods:
- Digital Time Capsule - e.g. ability to bruteforce during 1 year using reasonable amount of hardware. That's for sender privatekey. You have to create around 100 private key pairs upfront, so that you could slowly use them to deposit funds there, then destroying those private keys, relying only on bruteforce data and ntimelock raw transactions dumps saved to be executed on time.
+ nTimeLock itself in combination with Digital Time Capsule which applies to sender wallet. And all of the nTimeLock raw transactions are directed to one wallet, private keys of which won't be stolen.
So, you will have 100 sender wallets with Time Capsule key pairs which you will destroy after usage.
Also you will have accessible not destroyed very well known private key from your recipient wallet, where you'll expect to receive funds after ntimelock event, once you'll push raw transaction data into the Bitcoin network.
I'm actively studying this topic right now, once I'll come up with solution, I think I will open a web-site helping others to use this open techniques to save their Bitcoins.

1) bitcoin is great to be used for creating sovereignty. Soverignty is good to be used to go against the "mainstream price". Many people talk like big price is the way to connect dots. Its not true. Now only with Bitcoin you can save on everything: on taxes, on licenses, on any other "must have" stuff. That's where Bitcoin should go for really massive adoption. When people will see that Bitcoin economy its 10% of the world's goods cost, and when the fiat world is 90% expensive, they'll start buying everything in Bitcoin automatically.
2) Confirmation time is a huge setback for those merchants who want to implement immediate services. Insurance based fast confirmation DAC will both save your funds by holding your insurance funds &amp; on the amount of funds you're holding, you're getting a pillow which allows to purchase goods in Bitcoin without confirmation at all.

Inflation is a flaw. Inflation is what stopping my money from growing.
Just think about it - more population on Earth, the bigger is global economy. More jobs, more products, everybody just getting richer. The whole earth ecosystem is renewable and things which isn't renewable will be replaced with renewable ones. More products on earth are getting created every year, of course there is such a things like planned obsolescence which makes our stuff last only for limited amount of time, its like renting, but not every thing is like that - some things will last for decades and hundreds of years. Things like the Internet. Things like the real estate. If there will be no nuclear wars and massive destruction, then everybody is just getting richer.
But we as fiat money users don't see it. With Bitcoin will be able to see it. Bitcoin is like a saving account, but bank is paying you only 2,5% for your funds you deposit on your saving account, which only covers the inflation rate, while with Bitcoin, you can say things like this: "I can't buy a house, because I have only 50% for what is required for purchasing a house, maybe I'll purchase a house a year later when my Bitcoins will grow" - which won't sound like too big deal.

There is 1000 benefits. If Apple creates its own fork, the first adopters will be Apple clients those which use the iPhones. Yes this would be one of the hardest decision to make, because this could cause unpredictable and irreversible social impact. And exactly such actions is Apple-style. I already told you that Branding matters, and that Apple has chance to take over this market anyway.
Are you really sure that everyone in the world have any way to prove the pre-mined coins? Also such big company may even not pre-mine, and they will anyway gain benefits.
Once Tim Cook announces the fork, it becomes irreversible decision, on one hand you can't resist innovation, on the other hand there's nothing wrong with it.
Even if they will pre-mine coins not for 50%, but for 90%, do you think users will have choice? Do you think that this is what society will choose to protest against?
You really think there is a way back after such a thing launched?
If Apple developers will start working under creation of very convenient services, they will have success in adoption, because once they will understand - they will start competing in mobile decentralization market against such services as Storj &amp; other decentralized projects.
Bitcoin believers repeatedly compare Bitcoin to the beginning of the Internet, and there is so much Apple devices, that any decision made by this company sets new industry standards. And I can imagine how this could be the beginning of the future.

Because Bitcoin is perfect. I love everything about it. Mostly I love that this is the permanent public locker to keep your funds in. I love that only 1 blockchain copy must survive to restore my funds. I love the fact that I can put my Bitcoin address on my web-site and be sure that in next 10000 years this address still won't be shutdown by service maintenance, or anything else.
And because every fiat currency failed. There's no world's successful example. Dollar collapse is very close, and nothing can prevent this. Soon people will demand Bitcoin themselves and they won't be asking such questions, it will be the matter of survival. Next day they will start losing their ground, they'll be searching for new lands, and Google/Collective Intelligence will be ready to serve their requests once they're grow up.
Its the rule of demand: you doesn't offer things people don't need for the price they can't handle (most people think that "learning curve" isn't affordable for them). But next time they will feel that deficit, they will ask for "learning curve" themselves.
This kind of reasons.

Let's say the current block is 
And let's say, that I'm a huge ISP, which owns network of 50,000 customers. And I know that 1 of those 50,000 customers haven't updated his blockchain yet (maybe because his computer was turned off for the last day). So I know that his computer is missing last 144 blocks, let's say I'm guessing that he is somewhere at the beginning of  blocks. And my next question are, if I'm ISP and going to isolate the whole network, can I achieve following results by providing fake blockchain from MY NODES by blocking my customers from the worldwide nodes:
Can I include my OWN transactions (generated by me) into the blocks      etc if I have watched what is the global network's hash?
Let's say I know that Alice's computer is in ISP network owned by me, and I know that she haven't turned on her computer with her Bitcoin client since yesterday's morning until today's evening. Can I pretend that I've sent her some funds like 1 BTC by including this 1 BTC into the next block by knowing the hash which was produced by the Internet's miners, while Alice?
If I can't do so, then could you please explain why?
And also its interesting to me is there any data which can be manipulated if you're knowing the results of the next blocks which user's computers from my ISP network don't know?

Not necessarily. We have the other choice. We can choice the path of re-engineering the 2 blockchains in such a disastrous moments. Why?
Because the situation is too complicated, and during the disaster nobody will refuse from using mainstream Bitcoin anyways - Europe users will keep using their Bitcoin wallets the same way as U.S. will do.
Then we have the weeks of waiting. There's no Internet connection, but economy doesn't sleeps - transactions must be done. So Europe will be apologetic about their blockchain acceptance, and U.S. will be apologetic about their blockchain - it is endless debate over who's more mighty, who has more rich people, who has more merchants, who has more hashing power.
Moreover you might be talking about 2014 where nobody cares about such events as Internet segmentation for a week, while I mean full-size 2020 Bitcoin Economy, where 2 huge world continents are totally depends from Bitcoin, and the whole infrastructure built through usage of the Bitcoin.
Of course first task is not allowing this thing to happen, but when it comes for emergency - sometimes nobody's prepared even in such a huge world. If it happens, then we will end-up with our nightmare - having 42 million coins instead of 21, and that is possible reality.
Blockchain reengineering will mean pruning 2 blockchains. Pruning process is finding out the balances of each openkey (each wallet), then you combine. E.g. if Alice has balance 5 BTC in one blockchain, then in the other blockchain she transacted the 5 BTC to Bob, then it means that we gonna rely on that. But if Alice has been transacted her 5 BTC to Bob in one blockchain, then she transacted her 5 BTC to Mary in the other blockchain, then in the new blockchain both Bob &amp; Mary should get their transactions by increasing the quantity of coins in the protocol. It is convenient - because on the one hand Mary's &amp; Bob's transactions won't be invalidated, on the other hand economy won't find out about it - the same thing is gonna happen, which happens every day with FED.

I'm not sure if that even possible to achieve through satellites - the satellites just won't be able to handle such huge amount of data as a few terrabytes of blockchain, plus every 10 minutes you somehow need some way to transfer around 250 kilobytes which consists all of the unconfirmed transactions for the last 10 minutes.
Of course if the whole network will agree to prune the blockchain, once it happened. But we need to do it fast in case if it happens. Pruning will be very useful, because it doesn't destroys the whole decentralized structure of the network, and reduces the amount of data to be transferred at least for the moment of fixing the communication channels.

I will calculate my password length according with how long our current best CPU's are able to bruteforce for 365 days. Any help with that would be appreciated.
Actually I'm not sure yet if scrypt is such an algorhythm that will ever have GPU support, do you have any better idea than scrypt? (I need some more common way of encryption which will have GPU support in future for sure - that's as a worst-case scenario protection for myself)

according to  from 2024 we will have supply era 4: which brings miners only 3 BTC reward since then. So that's very small number - almost nothing, and look at how much Bitcoins is already mined at 2024 -&gt; 19687500.00 - that's very close to 20 million.
So this is very popular misconception - they are keep saying you that we will hit 21m coins only in 2140, while in fact, we will be out of coins already in 2024 and miners will mostly survive just from commissions based economy from 2024.
All I was trying to say - that right now we have 60 thousands transactions per month. At 2020 the reward will be already just 6 BTC, I was worried if we won't manage to pay miners at 2020 (what if the deals will be bad). On the other hand I don't believe that at 2020 we will remain on the level bellow $10,000 per btc.
Its just no way Bitcoin will remain something less than $10,000 per btc in 2020.

Oh really? You don't know how many nerds out there on the earth, so 3 million users may even not be correct number. Even if so - do the math 10 million dollars / divide on 3 milion users, and you will get some $3333 per each user wallet. 
Cool! That means that once we will bring 300 million users - the Bitcoin economy will be expanded exactly 100 times and will cost $40,000 at the point it will reach 300 million users.
Haven't happed yet, but 3 million users is very good number anyway.

If you're selling it too cheap, you'll be left without Bitcoins too fast :) And that's what most people do now: Sell, Sell, Sell. That's how economy works))
Those who sell cheap, they're also sell fast. This is also the economic basics. Its like selling your own goods, the only difference between those of you who sold cheap &amp; those of you who sold it at the best price - is patience &amp; hardwork ;)
C'mon, many people here purchased Bitcoins &amp; already won't sell it for less than $100,000. Its just the matter of time when everybody will do the same.
Keep calm, and hoard Bitcoin - if everyone would follow this rule &amp; wouldn't spend and instead would save, then our $100,000 rule would work. And if $100,000 is not limit, then $1,000,000 is not limit either. What is the difference between $100,000 &amp; $1,000,000? It is that who's earlier gonna do - you or me, or that guy? All I know, its not definitely the guy who said "other people will happily sell them a bitcoin for much, much less (like $370)" because he compare himself with the others :) Using your funds in a free market is about competing.

Don't know the whole situation but +1.
Yeah maybe its easier to say such things when I'm not 65 (just 25), but I would hold Bitcoins.
Yes I got more time to compensate that, but I'm not making any money in my life. I'm not having any properties &amp; can't even afford buying 1 BTC that's what's bothering me - at least you've got opportunity to hold that amounts of Bitcoin 85BTC is a lot!!!
Maybe the right material decision would be just saving the house, but the right spiritual decision is hodling that 85 BTC &amp; even at the cost of greater losses.
I know many people here in Russia, who've got 10 BTC debts to get hold of 3 BTC (&amp; they are still keep loosing amounts like 1 BTC every quarter due to their poor decisions, but they still HODL! This was so expensive due to their broke financial circumstances) - with all their losses they are at least holding such a great promise! Its a future!

Let's imagine that ATM network created 100 billion of private keys, encrypted with master key. Randomly, with documented open source program. But it's not enough - there is need in generating 2nd master key, which is stored only inside of plastic card chips and this key must be STRICTLY unknown to ATM network, without which you can't reveal private key (1 key derived from ATM network, 2nd key from the chip).
But the problem is that I can't figure out how to stop ATM owner from emptying card? Of course central office may control this through the affiliated network of local representatives, but is there a software way of making sure that card is really destroyed after revealing 1st and 2nd key?

Bitcoin is easy to start using
Cold storage is the most reliable &amp; easy way to protect Bitcoins. Yes, cold storage is easy.
Every single person on earth (even 5 years old) can accept payments on their web-site in an automated way easier than traditional credit card / payment processing gateways
Bitcoin IS already used by many different people. I see everyday how fast people are at learning it when they dedicate their time for it.
Bitcoin is eternal. There's no such force on the earth (at least in next 100,000 years, yep putting too much belief in piece &amp; but even in apocalyptic scenario - people are most likely to die than computer hardware /communication - turning off the grid won't delete infos from HDD &amp; EMP can't reach the many underground datacenter fascilities) that can stop propagating the information over the internet, therefore **only one copy of the blockchain has to survive to restart Bitcoin.﻿﻿﻿**

For example I've found out that European Union produced around 70 risks which their experts are using to identify the problems with Bitcoin. And every ignorant person uses this list as a quote that they conducted research against Bitcoin, while it is not against Bitcoin, because it is mostly against all cryptocurrencies (i.e. forks). And because 90% of their writings here  is not applied to Bitcoin (applied only to cryptocurrencies in general).
Also one of the risk tells that the problem is that user must sacrifice its computer resources for mining to use the currency. Shame for EU.

not exactly its technically achievable too, through using GreenAddress.it multisignatures (based on 3-n-2 multisig, instant confirmation) &amp; green addresses from block.io service (this one based on 2-n-2 multisig) - this gives enough platform for exchanging Bitcoins in the matters of seconds, but drawback is that user's funds must be on one of GreenAddress.it/Block.IO green wallets (no trust intended - both of these services hodl only PART of their cryptographic multisig ecdsa keys)

no, I'm referencing to the immediate payments solution, if GreenAddress can be sure that at current moment you hold only 1 part of private key - then GreenAddress can assure third-party app/web-service that transaction is valid before waiting the confirmation.

Bitcoin opens the horizons for more competitors, it makes possible for smaller players to compete.
Can I ask question: why don't you open your own VPN-service? You think its hard? Nope! Its very easy! For 5 minutes I can write you a script, where your web-site will automatically provide access to your customers without waiting a confirmation (&amp; if confirmation doesn't arrives their access will be immediately restricted, but that's 0,001% of cases).
Bitcoin makes any student being able to open its own service, before Bitcoin it wasn't so easy at all. More competition - better service &amp; better price.
Your exchange method sucks. I live in the deep Russia far away from civilization, and my government banned Bitcoin, and we still have convenient way to use Bitcoins (QIWI atms is everywhere, its easy to fool our main national bank Sberbank by not specifying payment destinations for escrow based immediate Bitcoin exchanges).
Today for 15 minutes I've got my Bitcoins here:  - and I received exactly $47,0242 (converted my local Rubles to U.S. dollars to represent the price I got for 0.13330976 BTC the transaction. You know what was my exchange fee? 2%. My funds was transferred directly to my banking card. Using easy online banking interface on Sberbank I was able to see that my funds arrived. Next second I released my Bitcoins on LocalBitcoins escrow.
There's a lots of more easier ways to purchase Bitcoins. Sign up on localbitcoins.com, find online systems which will serve your payments immediately (Yeah takes time to research, but once you've done it you're becoming a power user)
I'm planning to open my own network of VPN-servers, so I believe 1 day my service will be way better &amp; secure than any other commercial service which making Bitcoin payment hard for you. On all my web-site I've built using Bitcoin I've made sure it is easy to pay (in fact all you do - is copy address where you have to pay, send payment, and then refresh web-browser to see the payment to arrive in seconds, most of the times even without network confirmation, because I trust customers and especially virtual services doesn't needs to be shipped so no trust intended)

I know, you might be tired of reading stuff like this and telling everyone "blockchain size doesn't matter" or "it won't be a problem".
But I really see a problem in the blockchain's growing size. And the worst thing about Blockchain - that its growth totally depends from the transactions volume added to blockchain everyday.
In this research (available after following this reddit link), I found out that even 1 billion 739 thousands transactions per month, gives you 1 TB of information added to blockchain each month. (I've found it out by multiplying the average size of each transaction which is equal to 575 bytes according to my another research: 
Currently in average bitcoin has 60k transactions per day or 1,800 millions of transactions per month. 
This quantity of transactions correlate with the quantity of blockchain.info users:  which shows you that right now Bitcoin has around 1,800 millions of users - it means that on each user we have 1 transaction per day.
Of course if you count that we will have the same tendency always - 1 transaction per user, then probably its okay, because we still have to live too long until we will have 1 billion of users.
But I believe once Bitcoin's userbase will be expanded, more transactions will occur per each user - so the transaction numbers will increase as well!

I don't think that Bitcoin needs investors - Bitcoin is not a company, and mostly investors misunderstand the value of technology, I wish them stop losing their funds, withdraw their money from Bitcoin and invest it into Bitcoin's infrastructure instead by opening their Bitcoin companies.
When big investor purchase speculative big stock of Bitcoins and locks them, he doesn't believes into technology, he believes that the other losers will pour in their money and he will get their money easily by withdrawing his funds (but doesn't matter whether investor's money will go up or down in value - the fate of his Bitcoins is always leaving the Bitcoin economy - that's where the circle is broken).
At least when a userbase grows, there is more low-value investments from users, and user has more value because it 1) More transacts; (by testing bitcoin services) 2) Keeps money in a long-run; 3) talks more about Bitcoin; 4) learns new stuff about bitcoin himself. And a good thing about a Bitcoin user is that there's a lots of Bitcoin users unless greedy investors who expect from Bitcoin unreal things and who is not patient enough to receive the value from the real Bitcoin economy growth and who aren't contributing anything.
I would rather wish Bitcoin economy 1 billion users each of them having 1 cent in Bitcoin, rather than having 1 crazy man who's investing his $10,000,000 then withdrawing everything and losing all faith.

If Internets are separate, how does they will find out who has less hashpower... Europe's blockchain won't know about existence of U.S. blockchain, and U.S. blockchain won't know about existence  of Europe's blockchain. It's just how Internet works.
So Europe will be building its own blockchain, and U.S. will keep adding blocks to U.S. blockchain. Let's say last block will be a block  so in U.S. in the next 10 minutes after block  the next block will be a  and in Europe at the same time the block number will be  but if you gonna look up which transactions are contained in the block  for U.S. you will find out different transactions, than the ones which contained in the same block ( in Europe.

Nice but youre counting 10% GDP my friend. 10% GDP is not 10% acceptance by the public. I think the mastercard and visa's volumes generated by less than 10% of people in the world, those people are the ones who know how to use credit cards in e-commerce, but the other %s are the people who hold their visas for reciving salary but only use it to convert to papercash.
So my friend, even Visa and Mastercard with its convenient methods of payment (which is not so convenient in comparison to Bitcoin, since the PayID program which removes necessity to enter your credit card details was created recently)
So dont forget that main enemy is not MasterCard / Visa. Main enemy is a paper money which people can[t stop using.

Again, I'm against any services who stores private keys for me.
I'm asking exact thing on my post. Read my lips. "Remove" "the" "email" "on" "sign-up"!!!
Most people will understand that since they entered only passwords (&amp; no email mentioned), they will finally realize that service can't send them password, just because it doesn't knows their email!
How useful email could be for blockchain with its backups - if a user doesn't remembers any password anymore? This backups are irrelevant!
Even as experienced PC user, I made a mistake in the past which costed me some money. After that incident I remember myself as being stupid, but now I understand why it happened.
There's nothing difficult in my request. In fact it follows simple logic: If user haven't specified his email during signup, and if user doesn't wants to specify his backup email otherwise, then it means that user doesn't needs backup! When there's some option for specifying email, users think that it is mandatory, and even "(optional)" field doesn't tells me &amp; user anything! I found out that emails are optional on blockchain.info only right now! And that is including that I have technical background, I'm 3 years with Bitcoin, I know the blockchain's API and even write an apps for that, but this was a BIG surprise for me that I can skip that email field.
User can enter his email somewhere in the deep settings, but in this case this shouldn't be called like "main email" or something. And even in deep settings it should be called as "where do we send your files backup" (with huge "we can't send your password sign")

And as far as I know after 100mb block size there will be problem with bandwidth, since for 100mb is hard to reach all users on Internet within reasonable time. Approximate size of 1 transaction = 250 bytes if you divide it on 100mb = you get 400,000 transactions which may occur during 10 minutes. 400k tx * 144 blocks per day = 57,6 millions of transactions per day. Or 57,6 * 30 = 1,7 billion transactions per month averagely before we will ever think about bandwidth limit.
Today we usually get not bigger than 70,000 transactions = not bigger than 2 million transactions per month.
Correct me if I'm wrong.

But I saw in my Bitcoin client some very easy function which lets me sign the transactions. Next time I login to blockchain.info I could add watch wallet, then press "Send money to ...", then system could ask me something like "Confirm your transaction with your signature" without storing even encrypted keys.
I get nervous everytime I enter my password on a blockchain.info (since I know how web works, I know it can be possible to log my password on a server-side), but I like the fact that I don't need to install any software to make a payment.
I know generating signature would be complicated for average users, but I myself wouldn't mind having such a functionality.

This is interesting, but do you remember that in order to really process her transaction which she may try to spend, attacker might need to mine another block (which will take another 14 days, right?). I don't think that attacker can wait so much, since 14 days to send, and 14 days to wait for faking her spending is not reasonable.
Perhaps by talking about including the transaction in the malicious fork you mean some of actions attacker may perform by dealing with victims transactions on the side of miners, right? But doesn't that will mean that attacker's miners (his botnet) will put victim's transaction into the list of unconfirmed transactions anyway therefore accepting transaction anyway.
I mean 1) my question is - when does the transaction is accepted into the malicious fork, who decides - I suppose miners decide it automatically, right? I mean in case with controlled IP ranges by malicious ISP it possible to make victims think that their transaction is went through just by keeping botnet miners online right?
And 2) another question is - can victim send multiple transactions and still expect all of them to be confirmed after malicious miners put them into "the cloud of unconfirmed transactions"?
So perhaps all of those people connected to ISP will be waiting 14 days without access to Bitcoin's main blockchain, some of them will try to do some transactions, and that may mean that botnet miners should be active all of those 14 days and should be ready to accept unconfirmed transactions to be included into malicious fork, and that will mean that customers during these 14 days may still think that their Bitcoin client is functional if they won't try to check where their spent funds go (maybe 90% of times people will check anyway whether the recipient got funds, but on the other hands the percent maybe lower when it comes to 1 or 2 transactions only during those 14 days waiting period)

Seems like not everybody can become expert / comment-er.
2. Right now there's 115 responses not even single response in favor of law. I don't really know why this expert opinions are created, I don't understand politics.
3. The whole attitude of government towards such things as virtual money is ignorance - they usually don't care how much people use it, they don't care what the other countries think about it. They don't care about anything - they just do what they do.
4. Government defines Bitcoin &amp; cryptocurrencies as "surrogates of money" &amp; CBR (Central Bank of Russia) in the beginning published in its documents by reminding citizens that they should stay away from surrogates. Publishing such things shows how much this institution feel about their monopoly on printing money for economy of the country. Many politics in our country say that CBR doesn't have exclusive rights for money, many people understand it because of the case with MMM
5. In the case with MMM - its a known fact that government closed this organization not for "fraud", but for Taxes. There was a lots of witnesses that 17 trucks with money haven't even left the Moscow city because these money was distributed between government officials who were responsible for this operation.
Everybody knows that MMM wasn't a fraud, that it was the government, who closed this company &amp; it was the government who was suing its creator Sergey Mavrody for tax infringement (not for fraud) - at the same time they showed everything on National TV like MMM was fooling people around while it was the government who destroyed MMM.

Now I understand why Bitcoin is so secure, because even if you're ISP it takes too much efforts, but also it is very easy attack if you are the ISP that controlling 90% of users in the city - because most ISPs has dynamic IP addresses, but billing system always knows which users are logged and using the Internet - so the whole billing system can be corrupted in case if management or local sysadmins are willing to do that attack.
And actually in this case, attacker may choose many victims, but processing each 1 victim will always take up almost all of the expensive mining equipment purchased. If someone will want to purchase more hashing power to allow mining for 5 or 10 victims, it will take significant amount of investment, but still reasonable investment if someone will want to play big.

For me this explanation doesn't says anything. Because it misses the most important aspect of Bitcoin: the fact that it has only restricted amount of Bitcoins. The same way as Dollar has Cents, Bitcoin has Satoshi, but instead of 100 Cents in 1 Dollar, there's a 100 million Satoshi in 1 Bitcoin.
So if Bitcoin costs (approximately) $400, it means that for $200 you can purchase 50 million Satoshi. For $20 you can purchase 5 million Satoshi. And for $4 you can purchase 1 million Satoshi:
$400 = 100,000,000
$4 = 1,000,000
Awesome, isn't it?
Why so much Satoshi? Because Bitcoin is divisible = you can divide it up to 0,00000001 = 1 Satoshi (Currently it is artificial limit, but once 0,00000001 will become $1 worth, this limit can be easily removed without affecting the other network rules)
I believe that one day 1 Bitcoin will be worth $1,000,000. So we will be purchasing 100 Satoshi for 1 Dollar which means 1 satoshi for 1 cent.

And I don't understand why you're using such small amounts of roubles to demonstrate their fees - you say things like 2 RUB - who the damn heck cares about 2RUB?! Why don't you say 200 RUB at least as an example? Yes I know about the micropayments importance, and I like opportunity to put 2 RUB to my balance and QIWI doesn't apply any fees to such amounts either!
Okay I don't talk about AKADO. AKADO itself is an expensive ISP, why don't you choose other kind of ISP?! I know in Moscow there's not often such choice, but if I had a choice I wouldn't use AKADO, because their technologies are outdated (still using different kind of outdated routers and modems).

The fact is that Callback URL should have to be a Callback URL.

Bitcoin should be neutral. And your expression itself isn't neutral.
If someone wants to make a web-site about religion using HTTP-server (the TCP/IP technology), why you would stop him?
If someone wants to use math to create technology that helps religion? This is about freedom of religion. Why would you try to stop it too?
So that's why I will assume that this kind of "don't do this, don't do that" standpoint is religious. That's proves over &amp; over again that atheism itself is a religion by itself &amp; has nothing rational in itself (in plain words has nothing to do with math)
Stop doing that. Bitcoin is about justice. And there is justice in Muslim religion. There is a justice in Christian religion. There is a justice in Jewish religion. And now there's a justice in the world.

If current speed of network needed to overcome all of the miners is 125 petahashes (125,000,000,000,000,000).
Then that means that I can start solving the next block with my 10GHash miner, and if I'll divide 125ph on 10GH, I will find out how much seconds I need to generate 125ph powered hash. 125,000,000,000,000,000 / 10,000,000,000 = 12,500,000 seconds needed to solve 125 petahashes which is enough to insert the next block. 12,500,000 seconds is 3472 hours, which means just 144 days :) But if you'll take something like 100GH, it will mean 1,250,000s or 14 days only! It means that I only need to purchase ten of 10GH miners in order to accomplish the next blocks for 14 days, which is not very expensive for many attackers.


No it is not exactly an hour. You may watch until the customer is online, then if he's offline, you're assuming that his wallet is off the Internet (that was his last block he's downloaded). Of course you can start mining for finding the next block for your victim, but it may not work if he will appear earlier on the Internet (but even if he appears, if you are controlling the ISP's network, you may use firewall to close his connection from accessing any irregular ports - to block his Bitcoin client from receiving fresh blockchain data), once your block is ready 14 days later after mining, you're allowing to download the next block prepared by you right from your botnet with your transaction included to his pubkey.

It takes only 30 minutes of making wrong decisions to ruin the months or maybe years of hardwork. I can't guarantee that such 30 minutes won't appear in my life, especially when I know that there's too much emotional things on which I spare my attention. I can't cut myself from having those creative intentions. And at the same time Bitcoin is too important to get overwhelmed by any of those creativity.

That's not necessarily true.
With transaction volume growth 
The numbers will be higher.
If the transactions will reach 1 TB by its 10th anniversary, it will mean that we gonna have at 10th anniversary Qty of total transactions: 2212389380,5309734513274336283186
And that is your vision for the Bitcoin's popularity ;P
Only 2,2 billion transactions? If we will have only 2,2 billion transactions made overall at 10th anniversary, then that will mean that currency was not performing so good during the 2014-2019.
Because 2,2 bln transactions for 5 years from now would mean:
- Only 440 millions transactions per year
- 36 millions transactions per month
- current quantity of transactions per day is 60000 and in next 5 years it should become only 1.2 millions per day - that will make 60000 thousands to be only 5% from its potential (just 95% growth)

Would you guarantee that you will be checking your blocks everytime you're receiving transaction? (if you wouldn't read this thread?) Even Bitcoin experts sometimes don't remember which block was last, because everybody think that it just works and they are too busy checking other things.


She won't, because she doesn't knows why she should do it today. Even though I know this solutions for a decades, I'm not using them on everyday basis.
Its easy to find out which block the customer is on: you can use script which can PING customer's computer, and when you know the time, when customer turns his computer off, you're already almost knowing what is the block he/she will be missing when tomorrow or next week his/her computer is back ;)
By the way - this thing could be achieved not only by controlling an ISP network, but by virus writing too - in case if your virus can have privileges to access the firewall settings. 
So its relatively simple to fool a Bitcoin user for advanced attacker, I thought it is impossible :)
But again this as far as I know will make possible only to perform double-spend, right? Because even without global network support cut by attacker Alice's computer will be able to figure out whether sent money to her is spent or not. Also the problem is - if she will want to spend her Bitcoins, she won't be able to do it from the same wallet. And also if she has the same wallet on her Android/iOS device, then it will show 0 BTC received.

Credit cards can't compete with Bitcoin until all of the transactions won't become irreversible.
Chargeback mechanism is a very complicated machine, not fair, irrational, stupid and old-century. Think about this: chargebacks are made for stupid people who's leaving their credit card details everywhere in inappropriate places. 21st century is about irreversible payments and smart consumers.
Bitcoin won't compete with credit cards, Bitcoin will eat it.

I believe Bitcoin is not only reducing shopping costs. It also creates the unique category of services, which wouldn't exist without Bitcoin. And I'm not talking about criminal ones. I'm talking about such categories where traditional companies taken over the whole market.
People doesn't need 3% change. People need 80% change in price. The Bitcoin Users are capable on reducing costs for average business by removing the wrong types of businesses out of their ecosystem. And by doing so they will provide 80% challenge to traditional business.
Its not 3% cheaper to use Bitcoin. It is 80% cheaper.

With credit cards you also can provide fake identity / mailing address - what the sense of verifying it when it can be faked?
I'd be better looking for monetary incentives for making authenticity of a user.

(2) Another alt-chain solution is coming (I saw somewhere on 1, 2nd reddit page new introductory for blockchain passports).
Of course (1) and (2) both of them are futuristic stuff &amp; not practical right now, I'm just saying/mentioning it how it could be done smart way.
(3) The practical solution for right now in a few days will be OpenBazaar with its smart contracts.

From the beginning of our conversation I meant that Apple can create exactly copy of Bitcoin i.e. fork. And there is reason to do so:
1. Branding purposes. McDonald's didn't invented hamburgers, but if you ask most of the people who was the first to start selling burgers - they will probably say McDonald's, because they was first company to provide this type of product to such amount of masses. That's how business works - and at Apple they're especially love playing this game - 1st computer, 1st smartphone ( inventor of multitouch), 1st inventor of mouse, 1st inventor of retina display - you can argue that Apple isn't first, but everybody still speaks about this like they are first, so cryptocurrencies is just another technology which they can claim like they invented it first. They have a lots of engineers who can make user experience with Crypto way easier. If they will start promoting their own iCoin - and if they will do it soon, they have chance overcoming Bitcoin's capitalization market - because users of Apple will be forced to use this currency, if this type of currency will be implemented into their smartphones &amp; other products.
2. Pre-mining. Apple can benefit by issuing such cryptocurrency where they pre-mined 50% of their cryptocurrency's funds. They have potential for forming the market with cryptocurrency marketcap equal to trillions

1. Price is already too volatile &amp; useless as a store of value
2. Price is already down
3. There's already too much negative prapaganda, too much Bitcoin companies bankruptcies. I believe that Bitcoin companies right now very close &amp; similar to the stage of that dot-com bubble, when too much companies died because they put too much hopes &amp; money into Internet companies. The most lazy ones at that times told that "Oh, those dot-com bubbles - you better stay away from this market if you don't want to lose your funds". But truth is that they afraid to invest, because they're cowards. They don't want to put their destiny into unknown and they're too weak to understand inevitable truth.
4. Its already forked 2000 times and in future year we're expect this number to be 100 times bigger.
And I'm still here. I'm not purchasing and not selling Bitcoins. I'm developing apps. I'm doing tools, web-services, gadgets. And I'm planning to do this for the next 30 years.
You can't destroy Bitcoin. Because its backed by me, and my friends. And we are not going away in a next 30 years and won't exchange developing for Bitcoin for any other job. I'll eat you, and excrete you and absorb your fucking powers. 
You non-believers can change your mind 1000 times if you will. But I'm settling here forever. I'm building my future upon it. Am I fool? I believe there's no such tool in the world which can give more stability than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a containerization of all world's finances - new money standard, the protocol which will swallow all the other economies - it is the only permanent currency. As developer I can't rely on any payment API, just because they're not permanent, before Bitcoin I had to always change my payment gateways, just because everytime something new comes or some payment gateways are getting closed, or API is changed again, new security measures. C'mon. This is ridiculous. I can't rely on such tools anymore. It is 21st century, damit. I own Russian based IT company and since 2014 my company doesn't even accepts any fiat currencies &amp; credit cards, because most of our customers are abroad and there's too much hassles &amp; cost in handling old monetary systems.
And price doesn't matters. If price will suddenly go down to at least $50, I'm selling my house and purchasing as much as possible amount of Bitcoins. Few of my friends already considering huge investments due to its current low price (just $370 dollars for the whole 100 million satoshi!)))
But the lower price, the faster we will get to the point, when it is higher. Why? Because its like purchasing the arts of dead artist - but this is the arts of a dead programmer - dead because this programmer is never will be able to touch the people's funds, this will be forever the property of the human race.
I believe once in few years we will have unbeatable price like $100,000. Once we will pass that mark, every price movement we will see - it is slight increase each month (like oh my God! Bitcoin now costs $103,000 compare this to 3 years ago its cost was $100,001!!! For the last 3 years we've experienced the greatest Bitcoin's growth in its history for this decade! 3%!!!)  - that will set new stability standard (Bitcoin standard instead of obscure Gold standard), and that will be the time when everybody will talk about gold, traditional fiat currencies as the most unstable means of exchange. And everybody will call dollar volatile.
With traditional currencies your stability is artificial, its created by enormous lies like fed printing 16 trillions for bail out (for saving their bankster friends). They taking away that money for financing wars too.

I agree that measures against hashing monopolies is important, and agree that transactions shouldn't be double-spent.
But even if double-spending will occur in the system, the only privileges attacker will have is:
1) Ability to reverse transaction
Double-spending or 50% network attack doesn't mean  that you have to worry as a big company owner, because your personal assets won't be touched by such malfunctioning act as double-spending.
The key is that attacker can't steal somebody's funds by double-spending - attacker only will be able to reverse some transactions, nothing more. Reversing transaction is profitable for double-spender, just because some assets could be given upfront (like massive amounts of physical gold, or massive amounts of fiat money which was given after waiting 6 confirmations legitimately).
Sure as a thing for a reputation is not really good, but at the end of the day that's NOT my problem, because I'm pretty sure that my OWN funds won't be double-spent for sure. And I'm pretty sure that my funds is in pretty reliable place.
Even if such a problem exist - just imagine how much problems you have with fiat money: 1. ability of the other's to steal that money or reverse by attacking you physically; 2. ability of the government to make a 50% attack not to double-spend, but to 500000% profit by stealing 50% of holdings of the others (just by printing twice more money for themselves); 3. ability to suspend or close any money account that's opened electronically

I find the whole email technology outdated. By the way Blockchain is using emails only for backups! And that's it.

By autonomous I mean the ability of the program to maintain everything inside the system itself: the system works almost by itself since 2009 , of course right now its in active development, but still transactions doesn't requires humans help - it just takes computers to do all the job, there's no decision makers when it comes to Bitcoin transactions.


A.I. will also have precise algorithm. The adapting algorithm itself may not be a property of narrow A.I., since narrow A.I. solves only part of the tasks, not reasoning.
Bitcoin adapts its difficulty rate according to current network performance.


Are you sure? Maybe it doesn't directly solves your tasks. But it will do for humanity very important thing - it will remove any intermediary between you and your money. If you would choose other ways of money transferring/accepting, then you would need an intermediary, Bitcoin replaces intermediary and that it means Bitcoin can do this job better and that is a very intelligent service, yes since Bitcoin has precise algorithm you may say that its not a Weak Artificial Intelligence, its just a math, but I think you're oversimplifying the role of Bitcoin and difficulty of the protocol itself.
If you would oversimplify things this way, then the strongest artificial intelligence itself can't be counted as an Artificial Intelligence, because it is precise algorithm, yes real A.I. can make decisions about fixing its own algorithm, but the whole thing is a rational process and precise instructions too.

Of course, how come I didn't figured it out myself - so 600 or 10 minutes is what does it takes for the world to create 12 million difficulty block at the rate of around 125 petahash.
Well, for calculations I used latest miner I've observed few months ago and it was ASIC Miner or Block Erupter Blade (overclock) which I've considered to purchase some time ago. If you'll watch at  miners comparison chart, you will see that Block Erupter Blade is very outdated &amp; not has the best price, its $21 per Gigahash.
Now if I'll choose something newer and will choose to spend some affordable investment, then maybe such attack can even be possible.
I think those who's gonna exploit this kind of attack will have enough money for purchasing some top-miner equipment, and I can try to count how much it will cost:
The best price to gigahash ratio is provided by the companies like Spondoolies-tech, Black Arrow, Visionman, Bitmine, Cointerra. Usually it is from $2 to $4 per gigahash (compare it with mentioned above $21 per gigahash)
I'm never read feedbacks about miners, but I can presume that "Prospero X-3 (batch 1)" would meet attacker's needs, and it provides $2,4 per gigahash for investment. Price is $4,899 (almost $5k), speed is 2000 gigahashes. How about that, JohnWasser? :) 
But even though $2,4 per gigahash is still pretty attractive price, the power of 2000 gigahash isn't enough for powering such an attack. Potential attacker should have around 30 of such machines in order to attack the network efficiently. But you must remember, if attacker are rich enough, he might have some friends which could also be rich enough to have one or few of them to help him with sparing investment. To give you clue how much it costs 30 * $5,000 = $150,000 needed to correspond the needs of the attacker.
I think its not really big number for a big investing company who's looking for big profits, but spending such amount of money for mining hardware equipment is still not one of the easiest choices.
So now we're fully equipped, let's see how much it corresponds to reality - 125,000,000,000,000,000 * 600 = 75,000,000,000,000,000,000 petahash needs to be produced to create new block which meets hard-coded checkpoint restrictions.
After attacker spent $150,000 or almost 250 BTC on purchasing 30 miners and each of them having power of 2,000gigahash and with a total power of 60,000gigahashes, he tries to break code with a difficulty of 75,000PH / 60000GH = finally he has his 1,250,000 seconds or 14 days to perform an attack.

It may seems too simple from technical perspective (not for n00b users with non-technical background though), but the whole economy behind Bitcoin isn't simple at all - miners are economically interconnected with users, the users are economically connected to the demand, cryptography and network effects.
Weak A.I. is a very common term. If you'll read the articles all around the web, you'll find out such as this ones  where they keep adding things to the list of weak A.I. At least I'm not doing so. I just think - if someone makes my life paper free, it is pretty much smart capability to store my assets in the cloud, and since people are participating in moving those assets and defining prices according to this tool, I'm thinking it is close to weak A.I., because it has all of the patterns of Collective Artificial Intelligence (CAI) which simulates human intelligence from data contributed by many humans, mined for inter-related patterns... 


I presume that Bitcoin act as if it was intelligent bank or payment system, while its just all about public ledger. The same thing goes on with speech recognition, it is considered to be a weak A.I., even if the program is low quality and was written by some student on a spare time. Bitcoin in the opposite was written by God itself using A.I. and UFO powers.

This would work on App Store, because there's no chargebacks.
Also there is an option in Apple ID of buying App as a gift for a friend: So let's say you want some Bitcoins, right? I will lock my Bitcoins, in exchange you can buy me "that app" as a gift:
- I am happy because I've got app for Bitcoins
- You're happy, because you've got your easy Bitcoins.
But this is perfectly speaking. In a reality you would need some escrow-service like LocalBitcoins which will freeze my Bitcoins as an enforcement asset

Bitcoin is not a product, that's why you can't call talking about it marketing. Its not marketing its just talking about it.
Many people in Bitcoin community would leave comment on every YouTube video about Bitcoin if they would be sure that content creators would see it.
YouTube's comment rating system was created to show public endorsement (not **user endorsement** as you said). Or in other words "false representation of user endorsement" just doesn't exists - there's only people who are organized &amp; who's not organized as a community.
As a YouTube user I'm always searching in comments already existing comments which mentions Bitcoin somehow (to upvote it). Will you also call this guerilla marketing too?!
I don't know the person who've posted the comment - and very often its not only about Bitcoin, sometimes I'm searching in comments some different types of topics to upvote them. Does this should be also classified as a guerilla marketing? (Like if I want to upvote all comments mentioning the word "cat" - does this means that I'm marketing any particular cat or cat species?)
So upvotebtc is not about guerilla marketing at all. Its about helping Bitcoin community members to find each other on YouTube pages.

Price doesn't directly correlates with transaction volume. The transaction volume is representing a popularity of the Bitcoin network. But it doesn't sets the price.
The price of Bitcoin totally depends from how much corporations will start accepting it as a payment. More corporations accept Bitcoin - more transactions, more capitalization.
Before we get through the most important steps like total mining decentralization that's also requires users/community to take an action (read about p2pool &amp; purchase your own ASIC to join it ASAP), solving scalabillity issues and of course building the whole infrastructure for payments everywhere.
A lots of jobs to do yet and a lots of time to invest.

2. DNA is all about information. Cloning pretty much explains how DNA stores the information. I understand that I'm oversimplifying the analogies: but DNA is formed before child gets into womb, later DNA is a key information for the person's individual characteristics.
Yeah I just realized that forks are not the best to be described at all, since I always disliked the other forks except for Bitcoin.
3. My comparison about viruses inspired by story by HG Wells, "War of the Worlds": Viruses are our defenders in case of an alien attack.

There's no company, only me who's devoting some of my spare time to develop this service. I have a PHP-programming skills (my knowledge is not perfect yet had to learn many things).
But I plan on improving this service overtime, since there's 20,000 users on the web-page already waiting for something new and better. Totally the first week of using I've gathered only 5 donations.
I would love to hear any advice on improving the service, because I read every comment very attentively and almost 100% of things I hear, most of things which I can do, I do implement them immediately. If you have some basic php/MySQL knowledge, perhaps your advice would be great.
But also I would appreciate the advice among the other groups:
* Advices from someone who knows how to do proper marketing &amp; monetizing for such kind of projects
* Advices from someone who knows what is the next best thing to do about the whole design concept on the web-site (I know there's almost no designing efforts at all, but I'm talking about the changes which could be easily done by me, since I have the right skills)
* Long-run advices on priorities which I should have while running such kind of service.

It all depends from market cap - the more people store value in Bitcoins, less lawaflow. It depends from how efficient Bitcoin right now is at bringing new users &amp; mostly investors who really use BTC as a storage
@_date: 2014-09-15 19:16:10
Best ROI is x1000 from now until the moment BTC will become $1,000,000 per BTC. You can jump on such wagon before BTC can become $1,000 per BTC.
A year ago I am personally conducted research for myself using all I know about world economy, I did very simple math &amp; found out that we will definitely have such price. Yes, exactly $1,000,000 &amp; that's even gonna be a minimum starting point. But the main question is when?
Exactly at the time when the Bitcoin's market cap will look like something like current U.S. Debt (17 trillions).
So put your 8 grand into Bitcoin, today you can get around 17 bitcoins for $8000. The unique opportunity is not all about whether Bitcoin will become or won't become mainstream, the unique opportunity is all about how early you can invest.
And I believe there's no earlier than $470. And I will remain optimistic about saving in Bitcoin even when Bitcoin will cost after $100,000.
Bitcoin is a digital gold. Nothing's coming close to replace Bitcoin's savings capacities.
After PayPal will start accepting Bitcoin payments, you will see raise until $2,000 - with such price you will be able to purchase only 4 bitcoins. I think you are agree that having 17 bitcoins for your $8000 grand is way better than having 4 bitcoins for the same $8000 grand.
RemindMe! 180 days "I promised a guy a that price of Bitcoin will be over $2000 in March of 2015"

(1st MAIN transaction) You can actually follow the status of each transaction you signed, right? You're just searching the signature of your transaction in the next block mined.
(2nd Additional transaction) You can actually create CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY transaction without mentioning amount. Instead of amount, you're specifying the signature of your MAIN transaction. Now in second CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY signature Bob has to sign with his private key next strings: SendFrom, SendTo, GetAmountFromTxSignature
GetAmountFromTxSignature is a reference link showing that this is a insurance transaction.
Now miners can check whether transaction with GetAmountFromTxSignature and they can verify if MAIN transaction has at least 1 confirmation. If there's at least 1 confirmation, then GAFTS transaction is invalidated.
If Bob network will see two different GAFTS transactions, all of his transactions are invalidated
EDIT: Unfortunately GAFTS thing won't work. That was just a modeling.
The whole idea can work only within central environment. But Bitcoin is kept decentralized just because insurance company has access only to insurance funds, and as long as insurance company exists, it will have the first vote for chosen merchant. If insurance company is corrupt, then it can send double spent transactions.
No BIP needed, because unconfirmed transactions are already supported to immediately receive any payment. If callback comes from insurance company, then it means that insurance company recommends your servers to ship product to your customer immediately.

When it comes to money, there's always someone who's ready to make it a likely scenario for themselves. I think that the hardest thing in this kind of attack is not time, but the investment of course. But this investment won't be lost anyway, since $1 million dollars spent on mining equipment most of the time will be used for MINING.
And since the hardest thing is finding investment, there could be even co-investors like miners who would want to cooperate for getting a share (Miners who purchased their $5,000 hardware will be just offered 2 or 3 times better profit for their mining). Still think it is unlikely? To make it likely if you can find those 300 miners who own $5,000 equipment, itwill bring you with 600,000 GHs. Why am I mentioning 600,000 GHs? (in the article I spoke about 60,000 GHs with 30 miners) Because with 600,000 GHs you can generate block each 1,5 days.
It means that for 14 days of sleeping customer (not having his computer/Bitcoin client turned on) you can manage to generate over 10 blocks!
Once you have such hashing power to generate 10 blocks, the group of people who's performing such attacks will be able to massively collect gains. See, even if you have bunch of co-investors, it won't be hard for them to get ROI, because imagine that during a week or few months such attackers will be able to gather more income than you could ever imagine by bringing huge damage to the currency itself.
If you think that Bitcoin Foundation will react quickly for the problem, I think that's what's not likely, because those criminals who will work on these kind of stuff, can work around the world and complains all around the world and will be next to impossible to investigate - because there's no evidence - the whole currency is virtual, once attacker disappears, there's no funds, no network restrictions anymore, even the fake blockchain is being wiped out - because its gonna be replaced by mainstream blockchian. And the whole world will think that this is just some vulnerability. So this is a very likely thing to happen.
I don't really know how to improve Bitcoin-QT client to make it ISP attack resistant, but if somehow Bitcoin-QT could notify user that this blockchain is most likely is fake (in case if there's only few blocks processed during the time, or even if there's 10 confirmations, the alarm system within Bitcoin-QT could tell customer that there's too small volume of transactions included into next blocks), then that would be enough for attack to not happen.

But I don't really like the reselling plans, yeah I know that prices maybe reasonable, but $20 is too much in my humble opinion - because most resellers start their career with no customers at all &amp; MochaHost offers in this case better plans - they provide prices from $14.
&amp; The most annoying thing for me is that you're putting Bitcoin as the latest currency in the list with the wrong punctuation... That's killing me... "Credit Cards , Debit Cards ,Paypal ,Perfectmoney ,Webmoney ,Skrill ,Bitcoin ,Payza ,more..." - you better put Bitcoin as first or remove these credit cards at all!
But that's not the only 1 problem, another problem is that you're posting your hosting to Bitcoin reddit &amp; expecting any admiration from Bitcoin users, while not caring about at least hiding all of the other alternative payment methods, because it is big advantage to be a company which accepting only real 1 money = Bitcoin.
Also I hate that there's too much steps before Bitcoin. As a user I don't need to fill form to purchase your service, its so 1995. Forms are not needed!

MultiSig technology is pretty much well-documented right now.
At least you can go ahead and watch the benefits by browsing GreenAddress.it on YouTube videos, also there's a great project called block.io (pretty much different from GreenAddress, because it uses 2-n-2 multisig addresses).
The whole idea for such multisig wallets is based upon the ability of a company to decide which payments can go through, and which payments can't go through. You should give authorization to such company, here comes the question "**how?**" Multisig is the answer:
* Imagine that GreenAddress.it using multisig in a properly-developed manner, and it knows the web-sites which you allowed to make repetative purchases. GreenAddress has only part of your key (1 of 3 multisig addresses). For allowing repetative purchases you just go to settings in GreenAddress.it &amp; add that web-site to trusted zone. 2nd part of private key you should hold in a secret place yourself. Also there's a 3rd part of your private key which goes to RedBox (like in OP's case). Now when RedBox requests payment from GreenAddress, first of all GreenAddress looks in its database for personal user's account - and **if there's such entry saying that user wants this repetative spending** then GreenAddress.it authorizes by signing a transaction which comes from RedBox. Also it gives flexibility - because if you gave to GreenAddress.it limits like (**I don't want to spend more than $2000 on RedBox, I want to do it only 1 time per month, only on Sundays, only if the weather is nice, only if THIS, THIS and MANY THINGS PROGRAMMABLE**), and if RedBox trying to do anything that contradicts with your settings, like spending over $2000, then GreenAddress.it ain't going to authorize this
* Secondly MultiSig wallets are useful, because they are litterally **removes** the 10 minute bitcoin confirmation. It makes every transaction instant, just because GreenAddress.it won't authorize double-spends too, because it knows which funds on the wallets properly arrived &amp; confirmed by Bitcoin network, and it also knows all of your spending attempts &amp; it knows exactly if you're trying to **overspend** from non-existent funds.
So MultiSig is pretty much Bitcoin 2.0 - instant confirmations (like most of the times even faster than in 15 seconds).
Of course right now you may think its far away. But I believe one day Bitcoin Community can and **should** vote towards slowing down confirmation time to 20, then 30, then even 60 minutes for network confirmations. **Because speed of network confirmations are not so important with MultiSig!** 60 minutes confirmations would solve blocks / transactions propagation problem (the problem with bandwidth / problems with expanding limits for block-size) without sacrificing decentralized manner of Bitcoin itself. But before that will happen we should build good MultiSig infrastructure.

Sure, we have a very popular bank called Sberbank which has 0% fee for most services, which is also has irreversible way of transferring funds from user to user with 0% fee. Sberbank is the next alternative if Qiwi will close their internal payments service, but inconvenience of Sberbank is that we don't have it on every corner (you have to drive to closest bank in the city to deposit some money on your account).
Two different payment systems - you can deposit on Qiwi just by walking even without a car; or you can drive to Sberbank if you have a car or a scooter when its summer :)

Why would anyone ever choose to store their biggest possession in the form of house? (especially when its not used for rent)
When you hold your house you don't even own your private keys! Some governmental agency not far away from MtGox is storing your private keys for you! Why no one is learning from Goxxing???! You're lucky if you live in U.S., because you think that Goxxing isn't possible, because government is reliable there. While in small countries like Russia, there's such popular type of mafia which everyone name as "black realtors", this is the type of mafia who's looking for alone owners, to kill them in order to change house ownership permissions. Its a pure form of Goxxing. And the worst part of it - the ones in the government who gotta control it are bribed and you can't even claim your rights back if that was your relative - once your private keys comprimised - you never get any assets back. At the time you'll claim your rights the property will be sold two times.

This cartoon was created by very famous Russian actors (Russians know these actors from the TV series "Interns" - these TV series is the most famous on Russian TV)
The whole story about Mr.Freeman (or mrfreeman0) character is somehow similar to Satoshi Nakamoto.
Because for a VERY long time (like 3-4 years) those famous people who was created this cartoon remained anonymous for a very long time.
Even though Bitcoin video haven't gained more than 600,000 views yet, its still not representing how important this message. Because MrFreeman0 known character by THE WHOLE COUNTRY!

Not everyone will want their address to be changed.
Some people hate hiding. And for some purposes its sometimes it easier to be able to use the same addresses because some people I know are having address books. 
Roger Ver is a proponent of transparency in Bitcoin. Now there's everybody's told that Bitcoin isn't anonymous - and I believe that anonimity isn't the biggest selling feature of Bitcoin. If you want to be anonymous you can be anonymous even with traditional payments (just by using the other people in your schemes). Payment censorship is what must be supreme focus of the Bitcoin &amp; all the other things the other payment systems aren't flexible enough to do.

I wonder how many ignorant people here who mentions problems with LB.
In my opinion LB can easily Gox everyone on a trade side. Because they have those stupid 0.45 BTC limitation for anyone who wish to put classifieds for providing services for exchanging fiat for Bitcoins.
That's main reason why LB will fail. I see public still don't get that it is very wrong when someone holds funds.
LocalBitcoins hold users funds! But on the other hand for customers on LB there's almost no risk - because they can immediately exchange then withdraw their Bitcoins.
I believe that OB will become the easiest and the most reasonable place to trade fiat to Bitcoin instantly, because in many countries there is USER 2 USER payment systems available which is irreversible, that helps to build straight logic in exchange in one area where 2 people use the same irreversible immediate fiat payment system

My friend, I was not asking them to mail me or anyone's passwords in email. But the fact that they put this "email" field is wrong. They're asking to put email and expect that people won't assume that their password is lost when they forget it? Come on, don't be so naive, most sign up systems in the world are easily restoring password for any web-site by sending it on email! That's the way people was taught!
They putting such field even for international customers and even though they know that their web-site is Google Translated on any other language.
I once tried to help them with translation, that was a huge problem, because I had to know how to convert formats and strings on github from multiple programming substances. I have 10 years translation experience, and yet I couldn't manage how to translate their web-site for free! They're on blockchain relying so much on free translators, while they're closing the way for such free translators by consuming their time with a bureaucracy on github, that is disgusting. It is selfish that the most popular wallet on the Internet is so racist. I call it racism because even though technically its the most wonderful wallet, they complicate things for anyone who's living outside of U.S./doesn't knows English - as I understand that they want to give benefit for understanding Bitcoins to U.S. customers so that U.S. could purchase more Bitcoins than the other world's population, and that's the reason I find it disgusting.

You know huge company actually can also have flexibility. In the heart of Bitcoin adoption, part of ingredient is a development. And Apple are good at developing good software &amp; they before doing something they are making things complete. This can increase adoption rate. And since iOS is a closed system, users also will be enforced to use whatever currency they given, because they don't want to lose iPhone experience, and most people don't ready to switch from iPhone to something else, just because of some accent to some technology which is philosophically not liked by many people.
Yes I understand that Bitcoin's userbase is around 5 million people now, and at the time Apple will implement their own fork there could be something like 100 to 500 million users of Bitcoin already (if that happens in future)
And even such adoption rate won't help Apple proclaiming that their fork is better than Bitcoin. Because users will find connections &amp; every end user at the end will know that there Bitcoin is a parent technology, more supreme than Apple's copy - and that will make Apple add additional point into their portfolio of companies who copy the other's works.

The reason is why I want to create such lock and ready to spend my time on it is because I want to stay both overexposed and still want to have an ability to save, but now in a forced mode - it is like paying to your pension fund - which in many cases can accept your deposits, but can't let you withdraw those funds.
This forced powers are way cooler than everybody think - this is the same reason why many people still buy many products with credit, because credit gives them opportunity to delay payment, then use force to make themselves pay by huge price.
As a strong believer in a Bitcoin protocol, I'm gonna believe in two things:
1) nTimeLock
2) Cryptographical estimation of the pwds bruteforce, i.e. Time Capsule.
This is two most important things to save my money.
I believe most people don't get rich in Bitcoins, not because they have a weak will, but because they didn't even brought their intentions to be bold about their investment.
Now from the quality of implementation of this thing will depend how long my investment will last and I'm better on hoping on this solution, than on my mind where I prefer to left some space for some creativity.

what's wrong with Bitcoin central bank as long as you can check the validity of each cash.
I just can imagine Bitcoin paper bills issued by every government of the world, and controlled by the government with all that policy against counterfeiting and now with additional validity check - in order for your paper cash to be valid - it should be unspent. Also as a citizen you will have the ability to spend it by going to bank (bank should destroy it by law after spending it - spending means sending it on a Bitcoin wallet electronically)
Remember, one day cash was backed by gold. Now why we don't back it with Bitcoin? There always will be in the next 2 decades such an old fashioned people who still prefers cash. Why we don't protect those people by creating a central bank. I think the article author is talking exactly about that, and you Bitcoin community is just showing how much you're obsessed by the whole idea of non-cash transfer, without giving a clue that some people hate non-cash transfers because of its complexity for their age.
I even wrote an article about that ;)

Okay, let me share with you my logic:
1) Probably you will agree that right now we have something around of 40 millions of transactions made since Bitcoin creation right?
2) And no doubt that current size of blockchain is around 23gigabytes right
3) So you question was where I got that from? I did it by dividing the quantity of transactions made since Bitcoin creation on the quantity of data generated in blockchain!
Here's my math: 23 gigabytes / divided by 40 millions of transactions = equals to 575 bytes
So here's my mistake - the average for transaction is 575 bytes according to rough dividing of transaction quantity and the size of blockchain. Sorry about that, I'll fix it on my blog

Making sure that ATM software is the only key that can unlock chips, is the best warranty that the card can't be faked - and the software part with master key unknown to anybody should go with closed source. 
Master keys will go with every plastic card to redeem it. The master keys are generated by open source project where everyone knows, how it works.
For redeeming each plastic card there is two keys that must be used:
1) secret key stored inside the chip
2) secret key predefined in database of ATM

you mean that those Bitcoin funds which were acquired 4 years ago will have the lower priority rather than those which I have purchased yesterday? But what if the funds which I purchase right now is the ones which were sold by those who mined it 4 years ago or which was mined today?

you mean that within 10 minutes each node are able to check something like 655.21 kilobytes (752 transactions was included in block 326445) - so you mean let's say 752 transactions isn't confirmed yet, so the task of node is to make sure that other nodes has all of that 752 too, right?
As far as Blockchain is pretty huge (over 20 gigabytes), its hard to comprehend for me - how this type of task is done so quickly?
I'm just really curious how much seconds it takes to check for the most slowest machines (like Pentium 1) that 752 transactions belong to blockchain.
I mean what are minimal CPU requirements for a full node to be efficient at handling let's say 10000 unconfirmed transactions? (or more? when CPU power won't be enough to check transactions before propagating them into the network (exactly CPU, not bandwidth)). Also does every nodes check **every** transaction by this logic? I mean is there any chance that on a regular node even 1 transaction can pass without checking its belonging to blockchain?
Also wait a second - do you mean that node can't propagate the transaction to the next nodes if it doesn't have latest block downloaded?
Let's say in future 1 block will have size of 2 megabytes, and if I have a computer connected to 56k dialup - probably it will mean that for 56k dialup it will take around ~4 minutes to download the next block right (if full blockchain is already loaded). But during that 4 minutes of expectation - there will be a lots of unconfirmed transactions coming, right? So what the node gonna do with that unconfirmed transactions during that 4 minutes while last block being downloaded?

Nope, because Bitcoin is unlimited in its divisibility. &amp; Because we don't need any credit supply. Everybody is equal to earn Bitcoins. Bitcoin is scarce digital asset. It doesn't matter who got the most amount of Bitcoin. The only thing that matters, that nobody supplies credit line (**FOR A SPECIAL PURPOSE**) by issuing more Bitcoins for its benefits.
Issuing coins means deciding what people would wish to do with the purchasing power of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Standard shouldn't be compromised for any benevolent intentions - this destroys the wealth of generations &amp; doesn't makes any sense.
I'm not moving an inch from this point.
Bitcoin is the freedom to decide **the purpose** of your hard earned coins.
Issuing more Bitcoins is lazy. Want to issue some coins? Go ahead and offer your goods &amp; services for existing ones.

That is very silly option, because Western Union takes some fee for transferring money, while all of the internal money transfers within Bitcoin is free.
And in context, the person choose the wire transfer as the cheapest way to transfer money, of course if Western Union would be free, then maybe everybody would forget the banks forever, but wire transfer &amp; western union coexists together - both have their disadvantages - first is fast but expensive, the second slow &amp; inconvenient, but cheaper.
Combine positive sides of these two and you'll get the other solution: Bitcoin - fast, convenient and inexpensive.

Actually by Private Key I meant anything which could be used as a key to my wallet.
 
But I plan not to encrypt the Private Key, but I will encrypt the password from my wallet.dat. That will mean that I'll also have some hash like 0x8348918757f28b8238c21898742df898327ab8 which will mean "09348573821983473" password, which will take to guess only 365 days - and once you'll find out that the hash 0x8348918757f28b8238c21898742df898327ab8 matches "09348573821983473" password, you'll finally find out the way to open my wallet.dat.
But you won't be able to open my wallet.dat, because you know only my hash for my password, and you may not have an access to my wallet.dat - so I'll keep my wallet.dats secure.

I think the best way to go with this is build first centralized service, adopt it, use it for 5 years, then build a DAC if necessary. If unconfirmed spending will become such a great deal that community will notice it, then someone with DAC solution will be found.
Every DAC solution needs a genius. But I think genius would have less job for creating DAC (because he would already saw the parts which works, and the parts which doesn't) if he could see ready centralized implementation, and if the whole thing works at all.

In case if you're pruning 2 created blockchains due to usage of both, you're having a problem with trust of those members of community, who's already 2 times spent their coins (e.g. brothers Winklevosses might fly to Europe at such time in order to spend their 100000 BTC, and Satoshi could fly to America to spend his 1 million BTC even though I believe he wouldn't do that, because he's a God).
We can of course validate both double-spent transaction even though it is unfair, but this thing can happen only once. Let's say Satoshi transfered 1 million of his Bitcoins to his other wallet on the 2nd blockchain, and on the 1st blockchain he put his 1 million to the other wallet - then he got richer on 1 million, but he can't do it twice, because of such hierarchy of 2 blockchains. So during such pruning everyone who had significant amount of Bitcoins already gonna win.
Its a good thing just the private individuals wins, but the problem is that this might be easily done by a corporation, who's planned such event, and who's invaded the Bitcoin Foundation and other huge Bitcoin clients too. Such combination would be deadly to Bitcoin and will enrich those corporations, but the key here is that it will be done only once.
In the news we will see it this way: "During the 3rd world Internet segmentation, the Bitcoin Economy suffered the most due to its architecture - we had 1 month of isolation of two continents, and after restoring the world after those disastrous effects done by the authorities of both unions, we've came to conclusion that we have to prune both blockchains. After premature analysis of both blockchain after all those events we've found out double-spent transactions on the amount of 12,000,000 bitcoins. We can't just simply cut of this amount of transactions, they're already done, coins are already in circulation in both jurisdictions, we've done all measures which we could by isolating targeted users from sending transactions internationally on the 2nd blockchain before pruning, but there was too many rich people who knew and was prepared to benefit on a disasters occurred. So Bitcoin Foundation come up with the proposal of including those 12,000,000 double-spent bitcoins into main blockchain, by increasing already set limit for 21,000,000 thus setting new limit of 33,000,000 bitcoins. New pruned fork is available for downloading since today, on bitcoin.org, MultiBit.org and the other major bitcoin client web-sites"

I don't like bits denomination (I always liked Satoshi), but I started using ChangeTip not because I didn't knew anything about it - I've seen ChangeTip all the time on YouTube, Reddit &amp; in many places where I see a lots of comments. 
I knew that ChangeTip is awesome, but never bothered to setup ChangeTip myself, because I thought it doesn't change anything &amp; only spends my last funds. Personally I discovered that I can be tipping everyone with one cent, after there was a series of upvoted reddit posts, which encouraged everyone to start using ChangeTip, then my desire was finally strengthened by David Seaman's video where I tried my first several unsuccessful attempts to do tip someone. (My YouTube/G+ profile name is Earl Fox you can see my comments at David Seaman's ChangeTip video) Since Seaman's video I'm using ChangeTip everywhere especially under videos with content creators who don't know about Bitcoin (btw that's not the only way to raise attention of content creator - there's the whole reddit  dedicated for raising attention for Bitcoin at videos with a lots of comments)
Following this logic, I believe the real power of Bitcoin is in its ability to handle cheap amounts - last time I've seen a guy who's tried to revolutionize the YouTube by not watching ads, but by paying cents per each video  - that's the approach I suppose will make users start spending their dimes towards their convenience at the Internet services.
Maybe that's another revolution towards advertising-free Internet, where you can pay few cents at each log-in to keep the web-sites free. (Its like reading cheap magazine/having cheap readership) - The fact that I bought something (even for 1 cent) make me feel more satisfied than watching useless, annoying ads, but for free.

Also there's such a thing called upvotebtc subreddit - each video posted in upvotebtc must be named after the comment which asks YT-channel owner to pay attention to Bitcoin.
Most popular YouTube channel owners mostly has 10,000 comments under each video, and there's only 1 comment about asking video channel owner to pay attention Bitcoin. If it has no likes, then probably owner will never find out that such comment exists. But with upvotebtc everyone can help by pressing "thumbs up" on that comment - that's what upvotebtc is all about - its about bringing comments upvoted on youtube.
Usually it takes from 30 to 150 thumbs up for comment to be upvoted for the YouTube video creator.
At the same time, how much minutes for you it takes to upvote 20 comments on 20 videos? Not more than 10 minutes. Now imagine what will happen if 150 people will spend their 10 minutes too? This will make Bitcoin comments to be stand out of the crowd at least in 20 videos!

It is convenient to click &amp; enter the quantity of satoshi to find out how much dollars it is, but you can see in previous comments, one person stalked me that I can't say how much $170 is in satoshi quickly enough, so it would be awesome if your web-site could also could have functionality for converting the dollars into satoshi's fast enough (just add another string if its possible) Like both ways *Click the Dollars/Satoshi value to display the rate

Wake up, it says "Anonymous" transfer. If you're authorized user, then you  can transfer 60 thousand roubles and all you need to authorize yourself - is fill the form with your name, and that's it.
If you're passed identification (which is also not hard to do), then you can use the limits over 100,000 RUR per month.
If you're going to talk gibberish about stuff like "oh, you have to reveal your name", I'll tell you two things: 1) why you want to use Bitcoin for illegal activity - use it legally and everything will be okay; 2) why don't you want to pay 1000 RUR for somebody to go and do this identification procedure for you.

this is my whole point: why do we need so many denominations, if we can use just the minimal amount and that's it?

I don't have precise numbers - I was stupid to withdraw all of those funds right after mining. One thing is for sure - it was payments of something around 0.2 to 0.5 BTC each which I've exchanged for $10, $25 and $50. My total capacity with those 700 computers was something around ~500 MHs - that was a stupid waste of time, because to install ufasoft miners I had to deploy script which will install automatically those ufasoft miners on 700 computers - too much time consumption for nothing.

* P2P payments for the services USERS PAY FOR SERVICES
* P2P Internet Shop Processing API: LONG-TERM MERCHANTS ACCEPT TRADITIONAL PAYMENTS, SEND BTC TO SELLER BY MANUALLY APPROVING RECEIVING TRADITIONAL MONEY.
* Hedging
* EVEN MOAR!
All of these mentioned directions are multi-million industries! And the greatest point is that its easy to build such projects with basic web-devleopment skills! (Its not expensive at all to get started thanks to Bitcoin's openness)

You don't really need exactly Bitcoin Foundation to do that. Anyone can check passports. The WebMoney in Russia works exactly this way for already 10 years, and also WebMoney accepts WMX (bits or bitcoins) and automatically converts it to wmz (usd) or wmr (roubles) when I want to purchase something. They did it at WebMoney a year ago. 
Also WebMoney provides certificates called "Personal Certificate", "Merchant Certificate" - they check passports through notary institution + they let the other people be representatives of the WebMoney - those who want to be a representative should pay trust fee (around $1,000 refundable), also those who want to get verified pay around $20 per certificate (not really big money for certification services even for an average person).
The problem with bad actors solved by banning such certified bad actors permanently without returning their insurance fee ($1,000).
Also WebMoney has internal Debt system - those who have certification, they can get a debt from another certified participant. It is a great experiment which is not experiment anymore - a lots of people using it now in Russia. Those things made possible only because WebMoney is a huge company who already supports such system which makes their virtual money accepted throughout the country and even though WebMoney is virtual money, during 10 years government of Russia didn't issued any law which makes it illegal.
WebMoney has a lots of things in common with Bitcoin - 1) WebMoney is irreversible; 2) you can accept WebMoney anywhere in the world and send money only with 0,8% fee; 3) I don't know any cases when they frozen anybody's accounts (unlike PayPal).
And WebMoney also has the cheapest way to exchange Bitcoins to U.S. dollars and U.S. dollars to Bitcoins, since WebMoney itself has internal exchange web-site with no trust involved (you only trust to webmoney system).

Maybe you won't need central insurance company. It can be done using ECDSA for signing another transaction with a link to public locker where CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY protects by time. This is can be another type of signature, accepted to the list of unconfirmed transactions.
In 2nd transaction Bob signs that he needs system to verify is there funds in his locker. If merchant found funds in a public locker, then merchant signs both transactions with his signature &amp; sends to the network. Miners should include such transactions to the unconfirmed transactions. But I've found out that maybe its impossible for merchant to know if Bob haven't sent his insurance public locker to the other merchants. Error.

Hi, concerning Russian payments you can always ask me, I know almost every Russian payment methods.
LocalBitcoins.com is awesome for online transfers - personal transfer systems in Russia is developed widely, and many people use QIWI for transfers within a country. This means that you can easily use LocalBitcoins escrow for handling transfers into QIWI. Receiving side better have few SIM-cards for receiving large amounts of money. E.g. if receiving side has 150 sim cards, then you can receive 150 * $500 = $75,000.
So for small amounts of money LocalBitcoins.com is awesome, but for huge amounts you better have someone in Russia, who's having WebMoney account, because for certified users there is less hassle they can send more than $500 (e.g. $10,000) within a country.

1. Satoshi is a good Standard, hard to confuse with anything
2. Imagine the price of Bitcoin went up to $30,000. And now you're telling everybody "You should have $30,000 to purchase 1 Bitcoin" and they like "Oh, I'll never afford that", and you're like "Yeah, you're miserable". And they like "I'll never afford to purchase any Bitcoins in my life."
2.1 Now imagine that price of Bitcoin went up to $30,000 and everybody is measuring Bitcoins in Satoshi. No need to explain to people extra times that Bitcoin is divisible. They ask you - how much Bitcoin cost, and you're telling them that $1 is 3333 satoshi (that is the price of $1 in Satoshi if 1 Bitcoin costs $30,000)
Those who always use BTC as a measure will always need extra time to educate people about the fact that Bitcoin is divisible. If you're using Satoshis, they already know it without explaining.

Yes it sounds like Ponzi scheme, but true nature of service is a highly narrowed down to its place -  interest social network.
It is the social network main purpose of which is letting their users to share their love to Bitcoin by keeping commitment of holding $10 or 0.01BTC in Bitcoin for the system stability.

I'll describe my thinking process to prove you that it was easy (I did it immediately for 5 seconds:
1. To be honest I didn't remembered how much satoshis is $1 the moment you hit me with this question. But immediately without spending a second I've looked at the topic name which is under every comment and which is saying "Recently I found out that it is easier to use Satoshi to measure Bitcoin, e.g. $1 can buy 194359 satoshi today."
2. Now I know that I have to multiply 170 only 2 times (because 200000 satoshi begins with a number 2). 170x2 is 340.
3. 340 + 5 zeroes (because after 2 there is 00000 in initial $1's price). That's it. 340 00000 which immediately means 34 millions satoshis or 0.34 BTC
If everybody would accept satoshi, then people will see everywhere that $1 is 200000 satoshi, and everybody will remember this digit for calculations. The other member posted this web-site  which I didn't knew, it is already displayin that info

No joke! Do you think I didn't tried all the possible ways to deposit Bitcoins before proclaiming QIWI &amp; LocalBitcoins as the best mean of Bitcoin exchange in Russia?
Even though I can like LocalBitcoins because there's no alternatives for Russia right now, but I hate them for their policy for exchange providing users: LocalBitcoins force those who want to exchange to keep 0.4 BTC in their wallets, I don't understand this requirement necessity at all. :'(
That what stops me e.g. to act as LocalBitcoins exchange provider...
I wish somebody here in Russia would create some service for exchanging Bitcoins to Qiwi without such restrictions.
Also I afraid that LocalBitcoins can run away with those 0.4 BTC in a MtGox fashion

Policy makers can easily manipulate LocalBitcoins by making obligatory rule for Sberbank Online/Qiwi/TCS Bank/WebMoney/Yandex.Money systems to support chargebacks (let's say 3 days for finalize payment will kill any initiative to transfer funds online from strangers even with using escrow) - so P2P isn't so perfect in terms of critical sustainability.
It means that if I want to make some evil for Bitcoin community in Russia, its a right time to send this info to policy-makers. But I won't do it. Or maybe I should do it (because I'm tired of government being so careless for its own future - maybe tighter rules will finally kick all the programmers out of this country &amp; maybe this is a good thing). This will stop any P2P-attempts in Russia for the next decade. Preparing email to write about this to head bitcoin law maker.

Arrested for what? I am not doing anything illegal, I can show my Bitcoin transaction history to anyone, who will request - all of my wallets are public, and I marked every transaction I used for last 2 years - I am not using Bitcoin for those companies with untrusted reputations with companies who's not paying taxes. (At least my public addresses aren't associated with such kind of stuff) What kind of government regulated payment system can show the same level of transparency? None of them.
The law against Bitcoin is corrupt, and I already published on their government web-site my opinion &amp; along with my attempt to publish it they successfully ignored all of those 150 opinions from experts &amp; what was their response? "Ok, ok - we will give you discount on those fines we will apply against your Bitcoin"
Even if they will catch someone with Bitcoin - their law isn't categorized to "criminal justice", all those amendments to law are "administrative offences"
Even though this won't justify me in case if they will find me, here's a thing: Ministry of Finances goes against the initiatives of the president by publishing their law - the president's goal right now is to gain international independence - independence from United States, Europe &amp; other manipulative countries with their payment systems, with all those closed-source Windows devices / iPhones / U.S. web-services like facebook &amp; google. President encourages everybody to create the internal Internet services. I don't see possibilities for creating such systems without payment systems.
If only Putin could have reliable people who could mathematically explain to him what Bitcoin is, he definitely would made it clear for everyone that Bitcoin is a vital tool for Russian idependence, and he even would pass the bill for moratory against passing any regulating laws about Bitcoin. Also I believe that Putin would put in prision that person who's responsible for signing anti-Bitcoin law in Ministry of Finances.

Both services &amp; products must go cheaper. If all the economy products are cheaper, the customers can afford purchasing more. When you're dumping the prices, you're dominating the market. Some of your competitors will want to cut your head for lowering prices.
Don't be greedy. Most remote workers are ready to have some stable payments even if that will mean doing some cheaper jobs, or some stable online jobs, but this stability rarely provided in any free-lance market. If you give everyone a stability in free-lance market, probably then there will be more people who's willing to work for cheaper rates at your freelance marketplace. Everybody sets fixed prices at the freelance markets - nobody among workers want to make a discount, because they know there's not a lots of jobs available &amp; half of their time will be spent to search free-lance jobs, and part of that time/money will be spent to inefficient means of money transferring for their job + freelance board commission. If you would remove all of such obstacles, then there wouldn't be such problems. And that's about freelancing.
Now let's talk about products.
Yeah this sounds very abstract. But Bitcoin is all about costs. 1) Cheaper costs of running Bitcoin network; 2) Cost of producing goods (doesn't matter real or virtual); 3) Replacing the whole systems &amp; logistics with Bitcoin oriented economical optimizing
Many businesses in the world are employing the business model 1 to 10% expenditures for raw material, 80% for management - that gives you that price tags like $100, $1000 and such product prices. There's so many things in such categories which could cost cheaper, but due to market sizes/high management costs they can't be make cheaper, even though customers wouldn't mind pay cheaper!
I mean that all operational expenses could be cut. Entrepreneurship is being keen/flexible enough to provide competitive prices. E.g. before Internet servers wasn't popular everybody thought that normal shared web-hosting will cost at least $10 per month or bigger, but once we found out that quality of computers are growing, we don't feel like to pay for shared web-hosting at all. We can get the same quality of prices for $1.
The same revolution is have to be made about everything: current herbalife protein power costs around $40, original viagra costs $20. I have some strong belief that I should be able to order both of those things in the form of generic stuff, and I think this is a wonderful thing. Imagine yourself ordering some generic Indian herbalife for $3 (delivery included). Without Bitcoin &amp; without OpenBazaar such things seemed impossible. With Bitcoin - it is obvious.
There's nothing wrong with decreasing the prices. All of those who's saying that you have to make your time cost more money, and that's correct thought. But that doesn't mean that you're always have to increase your prices. Make product massive, dominate on low-price markets!
If at Bitcoin shops we provide cheaper prices but only for Bitcoin customers that could be decisive factor for Bitcoin adoption speed.
So don't be greedy, and start making customers loyal to your business, offer them discounts, but only if they're transacting in Bitcoin. In my opinion world can become better place if we follow this patterns. I think its time to fight monopolies. Patent monopolies, Product monopolies, Marketing/Management monopolies, Logistics monopolies - they are everywhere! And its time to take over the world. Bitcoin to the moon!

Micro Bitcoins? Imagine that you didn't knew about this conversation, now I'm telling you that I've got 100,000 micro bitcoins. You'll ask me to clarify what did I meant.
On the one hand I can tell you 100,000 satoshi everybody can google it to tell you how much it is.
On the other hand you if have 16bit (meaning your amount of Bitcoins) and it is easily confused with what people heard at their computer science lessons (stuff like 1 byte = 8 bits), if you'll tell them something like 1 uBTC, they will think that uBTC is some kind of scientific measure, like grams, kilograms or whatever else people could mean (maybe you mean an ounce of gold?)
When people hear Satoshi - they understand that they don't know something, since it is a Japanese name which they never heard of and that could be good incentive to Google it.
If you'll keep confusing people with btc mbtc ubtc sbtc fbtc x-btc rbtc wbtc Micro Macro Fackro Duckro motherYakro stuckrow sfxz jkfwoei nviowjion ievon v they'll just quit using those units, and everybody still will know what 1 satoshi means.
When economy will grow big enough to update the protocol, the satoshi unit will be added additional 7 zeroes (0.00000001 now, 0.000000000000001 later), and we will call it "new satoshi" and "the old satoshi" e.g. I've got 200000 0000000 new satoshis which means that I can buy 200000 0000000 ice creams in 2050. That's a lots of ice creams, but back in 2014 I've purchased all of my satoshis just for $1.
In 2025 even a child will tell you that 1 satoshi is one of 100 millions.

How useful email could be for blockchain with its backups - if a user doesn't remembers any password anymore? Email backups are irrelevant!
As a power Bitcoin &amp; Software user, I made this mistake in the past which costed me some money. After that incident I remember myself as being stupid, but now I understand why it happened.
There's nothing difficult in my request. In fact it follows simple logic: If user haven't specified his email during signup, and if user doesn't wants to specify his backup email otherwise, then it means that user doesn't needs backup! When there's some option for specifying email, users think that it is mandatory, and even "(optional)" field doesn't tells me  anything! No body even reading it! I found out that emails are optional on blockchain.info only right now! And that is including that I have technical background, I'm 3 years with Bitcoin, I know the blockchain's API and even write an apps for that, but this was a BIG surprise for me that I can skip that email field.

Last time I already shared some info about multisig's importance in Bitcoin's development. E.g. servies like GreenAddress.it offer green wallets which helps businesses get immediate transactions for GreenAddress.it users (because GreenAddress is multisig wallet &amp; it checks each transactions for doublespending before sending)
Also I would recommend studying the business cases where small businesses now again can return their power to start accepting money for their goods internationally. Don't forget about microtransactions which helps to use Bitcoin for any occasion - even for such small events as your teapot amortization ;) like whoever wants to use my teapot - should pay 0.0001 BTC per each usage (electical locks). This is the talk about Bitcoin creating innovation for such things where it wouldn't be possible without Bitcoin - Bitcoin opens the whole market category
I would talk about cultural understanding of Bitcoin - the way how few billions struggle can't be seen unless you haven't demonstrated it with persuasive pictures. But I'm not sure if you'll have enough time to talk about all of those struggles they're facing concerning their leaders taking away any publicly earned money (local mafia), about dirt in which African citizens living right now, about all of those unfair things going on in the world, just because of monopolies, absense of money in their regions.
I would talk a lot about network effect. Finally network effect is what will make businesses competative on the market. I would talk a lots about hyperinflation &amp; about how much current dollar system is worthless. (You can watch Mike Maloney episodes for having some clue about this)

But I guess, that there's nothing that stops people from transacting.
When Internet gets segmented, the blockchains gets separated, and now we have the problem of 2 blockchains, and if both continents has the same hashpower, then it will be even hard to choose which of those 2 blockchains created due to unexpected event are valid - imagine that this blockchains exist even 24 hours or a week. In case if we will use the 2 separated blockchains for too long, e.g. during the week, and if we will decide that both blockchains are valid, then there's for sure doublespents will occur due to network separation if you're looking to reengineer those 2 blockchain back together into 1 as a consequence of fixing the network after a week of disaster.
I'm not even sure how the heck do you combine 2 blockchains into 1. I think something like pruning must be done by the Bitcoin Foundation in that case (both blockchains get pruned with the account balances - the double-spent transactions gets automatically destroyed and we're starting new blockchain from scratch but with the same Bitcoin balances)

It is absolutely has nothing in common with current form of casascus physical coins - because in this case only ATM knows how to read the chip, and how to check the redeem code - each time you insert such card into ATM - the ATM should be able to say only two thing - the plastic is fake or not, funds are spent or not.
Once funds are spent destruction is required to make sure card isn't used in offline payments. Because each card will represent a banknote of modern form.

Boss will unlikely ever find out about this, since its hard to find correlation between blocked ports / traffic for some users and attack itself. Plus bosses usually don't know anything about routing, and they are very unlikely to find out how and who managed the billing in a wrong way, because it will take too much money just to find out what exactly happened on his network. And if malicious actions were performed from a remote location, by using an access which were temporarily sold/stolen from ISP sysadms, then its almost impossible. Yes it takes enormous amount of time to arrange those things, but believe me, it is not the hardest thing to do when you're over 10 years in telecommunications (and there's too many such people).

Sorry I won't agree with reply for (1): Side chains didn't meant to solve the speed of transactions, sidechains might potentially the scalability problem (I said potentially, because there's even might be no such a problem - because bandwidth &amp; storage might overgrow the requirements for scalability according to Moors law).
I don't really think that Bitcoin will ever need a sidechain.
Also about deeper technical side of 1st question - everybody said only that transactions are instant, but they didn't told why they are instant. I'll explain how unconfirmed transactions is gathered before miners will check them. Computer CPU's speed is enough for checking validity over 100s of BILLIONS unconfirmed transactions within seconds - because when you have open key (which is your wallet address at the same time) you can check whether transaction is valid. It is very simple cryptographical function which checks if the wallet ALICEie34fjegUrk3UKVNei7347ciuefi8 (openkey) corresponds to next parameters: amount, sender, recipient (which must correspond against the signature - if at least 1 digit will be changed in transaction message - as a result you will get completely different signature). Transaction message is Amount, Sender &amp; Recipient and these are the most important fields which must be signed with a private key (private key is something which you can keep hidden).
Now imagine that your computer got a broken network card, usb-sticks, com-ports are also broken everything is broken except for the ability to see the text from the screen and ability to sign transactions. You can write message like: sendto:Bob38jfmci3FN3ijfi838Jmci3jf3, sendfrom:ALICEie34fjegUrk3UKVNei7347ciuefi8, amount:25000BTC (yeah, $15 million dollars :)), then you put sign which looks like aea22632dcbd3536ce49f1a6e420da55075048312339e1ff2d6f35987028d9bb - remember that you can broadcast this sign publicly without revealing your privatekey (privatekey is something which you keep in secret, and without your privatekey you can't sign anything)
When you create your personal Wallet Address, your bitcoin client saves only two basic main information: (1) privatekey (has nothing in common with your password used to encrypt your privatekey to store it in file wallet.dat protected[encrypted] from other any eyes) (2) openkey (=Wallet Address).
(2) Now Bitcoin has something like planned economy because only 3600 bitcoins are created daily (as emission/reward) and there's only 10 bitcoins approximately comming as a commission daily, so miners usually don't get more than 3610 BTC daily (which is approx.:$2 million dollars divided on every miner on earth daily). This is how it works simplified. 2 or 3 years from now reward will be halved to 1800 BTC, 4 years later there will be 900 BTC daily fixed reward (fixed, because bitcoin system designed to give fixed payment to the address which found the block generated). In 2025 approximate fixed reward amount will be equal to only 225 BTC per day... 225 BTC per day = 82125 BTC per year. 82K is very small amount of BTC per year. But if at that time 1 BTC will be more than $8888, then it will mean that daily miners will get the same 2 million dollars (but at that time there could be even more miners than it is now). That's why mining crisis won't happen earlier than 2025 (in 2033 we will have reward equal to ~56 BTC which will mean that 1 BTC should be $35714 to meet 2 million dollars goal). Multiply $35714 on the mining competition which could be multiplied on 100 from now (this is very likely to happen you will see it as 1,000 petahash will be enough to cause huge mining reward deficit).
Once there will be lack of rewards everybody will start paying a little bit more of commission (not more than $1 according to my own math done personally). Why I believe that we will never need to pay more than $1 in commission? Because transaction volumes grow exponentially - we already have 2 million transactions monthly - this number will increase overtime. Imagine how much money it is for miners if each of 2 million transactions today would set in their clients commission for $1? (which yeah, I agree is huge price for a transaction) that will equal additional $2 million dollars for miners to existing $2 million dollars paid by internal emission.

Economically speaking 0.00000001 is a spam (1 satoshi).
Anything that brings for spammer significant amount of mass-spamming - isn't consider as a spam. 
The bigger the Bitcoin's currency cost - the lower will be the spamming indicator.
Right now if I would develop straight logic for developing any apps - I would mark as spam everything bellow 5 cents or something around 0.0005 in Bitcoin. By the way it is a default commission for miners in Blockchain.info.
Even though you should have your own head, I believe until blockchain.info has a reasonable policy about their mining fees per transaction, you can use that as a starting point to use as a marking variable for a spam.
I believe Blockchain.info choosen this amount (0.0005) because this helps preventing unsolicited usage of blockchain.info for a spammers.

I wrote this article, right after finding out about how easy blockchain's API is. And right after publishing I got a feeling, hmm, maybe I'm replicating something which already exist... (SMS notification from blockchain itself).
Yes this is replication, but I think its good to have such a flexible alternative as own php-script &amp; own sms web-service of choice - because in this case:
1) You are choosing convenient details you will see in SMS message;
2) I think using regional (local SMS web-service) will be more reliable (&amp; more reasonable than international SMS-service from blockchain - they written about unreliability of their sms service themselves)
3) The system of few wallets still haven't been implemented (Blockchain SMS upon receiving your funds is giving only this information: +12135168791 "You have received a bitcoin payment of value 0.0004 BTC (Approx: $ 0.24)" - which displays fiat money as you said (even if in dollars, not in the national currency). And which doesn't say anything about wallet from which money came. But maybe having several wallets is going to only complicate the whole process, on the other side, its not very difficult to check which of QR code number is used according to SMS text which was scripted by yourself.

Emission for creating a debt doesn't works for Bitcoin. There's no incentives to get debt in Bitcoin the same way there's no incentives for anyone else give you a debt in GOLD.
Why it is so? Because it is easy to give as debt something that doesn't exists, but extremely hard to give as a debt some hard assets.
Debt is just a game everyone agree to play because they recognize each other's IOUs. When it comes to your currency - risks for unpaid debts falls on the currency - the more debt unpaid - the more money will be printed in future for bailouts. Those governments who has better guns for enforcing debts are also great at enforcing the quality of their currencies. All of the other fiat currencies (with a weak guns) around the world suffering from high inflation rates.
Debt based on emission is a pyramid. Debt based on emission is a ponzi-scheme.
Everyone creating such ponzi-scheme knows how hard it is to run it unnoticable for masses. Giving debt is the act of saying to other person "My money is more valuable than yours, so let me give it to you, but you must return it with an INTEREST". In Bitcoin fans usually most likely have only one way of debit the people:
- We're going to make new economy, where there's no necessity for debt, because everything going to be so cheap, that you won't need to take a debt.
- We're going to develop services like  
- Decentralized DEBT based altcoin.

I don't know if that will fit into your list, I think it will be worth mentioning that Bitcoin also:
* permanent - When I publish Bitcoin address on my web-site/profile page, I know it won't be changed (only in case if ECDSA protocol will be breached which is very unlikely in next 1000 years). What payment system company can give guarantee that my account number will exist for 1000 years? Yes, I know there's the other factors like: Bitcoin core version incompatibility (in case if vulnerability will be found), if you're using third-party API like Blockchain.info to process payments - then you also depend on the company, but on the other hand all of this problems are easily fixable, while in real world those payment are not stable enough because there's too much things can happen: fees can change, security model can change, URL can change, company management can change, payment API can change, company can went bankrupt, etc/etc.
* global/international/universal - accessible in every corner of the world, and the same even on the moon.
* apocalypse-resistant - only one copy of blockchain has to survive to restore the whole network functionality, and with every person's balances restored &amp; untouched.

yes, its not allowed officially to exchange Bitcoin with QIWI because QIWI afraids punishment from government, but QIWI don't afraids to send funds among users anonymously, without questions asked about the purpose of payment, and by encouraging such transactions with 0% fee. That what I was talking about - the Russian citizen or anyone in the world who has Russian SIM-card can use the Qiwi to send funds among Qiwi users. That mechanisms could be used on LocalBitcoins.com to exchange funds using internal escrow safely, because Qiwi payments are irreversible.
I'm personally using only this way of exchanging Bitcoins (I find the dealer on LocalBitcoins.com, request to put Bitcoins in escrow for me, send him Qiwi payment, then he releases my Bitcoins). The best thing about this is 0% fee part, because on LocalBitcoins they don't really set really high prices for exchanging the funds.

Shorter version: This is just an internal experiment inside one company, but ultimate goal is creating more secure scripts &amp; UI for the companies who wouldn't mind adopting our solution for using Bitcoins at least as a coupon system (even if they don't like the idea of accepting BTC directly).
Main idea behind this is using 0.000342 meaning 242 rubles (this is our national currency, minus 100 rubles miners fee pre-calculated which doesn't means anything). Its almost like imagining that 1 cent = 1 dollar, but it works for the virtual units like coupons.

no-no-no. You're messing up the stuff. I know that Bitcoin Foundation write that on their web-site to not gain too much governments &amp; others attention (its a game) because they're kinda tired from that.
Btw here's a secret: paper money is the most dangerous form of money, because of its paper properties (it can be spoiled, stolen, rotten, lost, double-spended [inflated], infectionated, and it can sometimes even have some unpleasant smell). And here's another secret: Bitcoin is anti-inflationary - it is like an anti-matter with a deflation. &amp; nobody can take it away, because nobody can repeat the mathematical patterns your computer generates through special private key which you hold in secret.

You gave me idea, what if callback url doesn't requires HTTPS or are you talking about this?
Then this is really great news for me, because I'm already depressed for the whole day long, dunno what to do, such a small thing turning really into a big trouble. (I got a lots of other headaches &amp; big plans on starting the next big web-service)
So you mean probably my web-site doesn't needs SSL? What I usually do with PHP is described here: 
Basically I'm sending JSON request using this string described in API 
$my_callback_url = '
$parameters = 'method=create&amp;address=' . $my_address .'&amp;callback='. urlencode($my_callback_url);
So $my_callback_url consists that secret callback URL which should be called back. I'm just wondering if server will be able to call my web-site if its not encrypted.

Satoshi Nakamoto when he was alive on forums introduced the unit called Satoshi. 1 Satoshi means = 100,000,000 Satoshi.
Moreover 1 satoshi is a smallest possible unit right now in Bitcoin.
But most people went wrong when they started inventing stuff like bits, etc. This is not really good thing. There's nothing wrong with saying "I've purchased 600 thousands satoshi" or saying "I've purchased 50 millions satoshi" which represents right now 0.5 BTC or $200.
Plus people will most likely buy 50 millions satoshi than half of bitcoin.
Why people bother switching so many times between units, when bitcoin anyway will come into the state where 1 satoshi is the most convenient way to represent the smallest units of the Bitcoin.

In short words: Russian currency and all other fiat currencies are ponzi schemes. One moment they will fall (these moments are different and unpredictable). The major loses will be for citizens, because they invested their Bitcoins money to buy fiat money. So this is a problem for many countries. Russia, China, India... The best strategy in ponzi - is not to deal with ponzi.
&amp; **apxu**, you seem like you don't get how much miners can get in profits. Miners **can't get unlimited money** with mining - in fact there's a tiny **%** which Bitcoin ecosystem gives **ALL MINERS** &amp; they have to share this **%** among each other. Mining is built for supporting those who wanna transact, not transactions built for supporting miners.
Also you don't get that **Bitcoin** is the first electronic currency known for **being proven to be not a ponzi (by mathematical rules)**, and fiat money is a currency that **proven to be a ponzi (by historical events/evidence/unshakable facts)**
Also you don't get that Bitcoin has limited amount of money: **21 million** of Bitcoins. And even if you'll invest $1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 to break down this limit, it won't work - it won't work just because even such amount of money doesn't guarantees that you'll be able to hack/crack or take down the mathematical rules standing behind the Bitcoin. **21 million** is warranty &amp; this warranty fights against endless supply - wrong/unfair emission controls. Many of you who write such comments don't even get how economies work.
If you will want to invest mentioned above huge amount of money to buy the whole Bitcoin supply I'll still **HODL** (hold) my own **1 BTC** and I know many people who has their own **1 BTC**, even if our small society will have only 2 BTC sold for worldwide circulation, then this amount of Bitcoins will be enough to fix necessary supply, because **Bitcoins are divisible**.

Yeah, I've seen them: they are keep purchasing an apps from App Store - you can't reverse your payments on App Store.
Our country's payment gateways don't want to deal with credit card chargebacks and the whole economy built upon SMS confirmation + Credit Card = two technologies together to compensate ugliness of the chargeback concept (You can't chargeback anyway if you're using to pay with your credit card such gateway which requires SMS identification). The whole credit cards are ugly: CC fraud is immersive - they steal money everywhere and people are ready to accept it...
Also remember the eBay &amp; PayPal - they also won't let you issue a chargeback against them.
When fraudsters want to take away the money from stupid consumer - there's nothing to stop them, because a consumer doesn't questions himself and trusts to words too much.
Also it is mostly not about ugly consumers who don't want to get smart - I'm think I can call myself smart since I'm always studying the info on the Internet before purchasing something - but there's still too narrow list web-sites which helps me to choose the companies which won't rip me off, it is about building greater tools like: reputation online resources which can't lie, the business owners also should provide more certification to the public, so that people knew that they can't be ripped of in case if they choose a business.
The problems exists not only within Bitcoin - we still haven't solved many problems with credit cards too - even though credit cards are with us for a very long time we still treat it as a relatively new thing. But personally I believe that credit cards aren't innovating anymore, because startup costs are too big.
I am myself wanted to setup many online businesses 10 years ago - and I went through many difficulties when it come to choose my credit card merchant provider. Setup costs mostly was from $150 and that what stopped me from even the idea of having my own shop. Plus I was very frustrated that I had to depend on the merchant provider's wish - too much problems to simply start accepting a credit cards! With Bitcoin I think many small businesses will love the ease of the business.

Those private keys are sold as coupons. 
Customers want to buy this private keys, because business owners are ready to give discounts if user purchases 10x amount of business services offered to user. But customers don't know about Bitcoins &amp; doesn't interested in Bitcoins.
E.g. 1 customer purchased 10 pre funded private keys. Usually customers don't know that they can redeem them in Bitcoins by transferring those funds from those private keys to their own wallet (But even if they'll do transfer funds out of coupon economy, that's fair - customer by doing this just withdraws his funds from the coupons which gives those coupons liquidity guarantee)
Business owner wins, because he just sold 10x amount of services (with discount) instead of providing just 1 service at a time.
Customer is happy because he just acquired needed service in large quantity with a discount.
Bitcoin is growing because of handling this types of transactions, but customers doesn't even know what Bitcoins is - customer never asks silly questions like "how do I spend my Bitcoins" - next time customer comes with his 1 of 10 private keys to the company, the company provides needed service to the customers &amp; transfers back from the pre funded private key coupon.

I believe there will be at least 1 billion of Bitcoin users, so: do the math:
21000000 / 1,000,000,000 = 0.021 BTC per each person in case of fair distribution of 21 million Bitcoin without losing any of them.
But you know that people can't live without losing stuff/info. So 0.021 * $320 (current bitcoin rate) = $6.72.
Do you think that $6.72 is enough amount to purchase stuff on the Internet? (this number represent how much in average people will need to HODL for shopping &amp; saving &amp; a lots of other stuff).
I believe people need some virtual space having at least the worth represented in current $1000 value. But this is only minimal average requirements, because most people will need more than that.

I'll explain (TL;DR): idea is using Bitcoin private keys to create &amp; improve system of scripts which provide entrepreneurs opportunity to handle coupon system in their business.
I know many entrepreneurs in my local area &amp; in other cities I've been. If you would ask most entrepreneurs in our country directly if they are going to consider accepting Bitcoin, 90% of them will have difficulty with understanding why.
But many of those entrepreneurs have real urgent demand in some kind of CRM / Accounting software which would perform for them something like coupon-system. And Bitcoin can do this.
In this case we don't use Bitcoin as a store of value. We're really using it for its transaction / ledger values. I am performing transactions of coupons on the Bitcoin's blockchain, here's how it works:
1) I've modified the script of brainwallet.org and replaced the words "Passphrase" with "Coupon Code" and explained my boss how to use it. I've removed all the complicated hash-codes (as you can see on imgur I've posted as a subject of this topic)
2) Business owner for whom I'm making this coupon system are having 150 employees around the city who are directly serving the customers (in therapeutic, healthcare &amp; other services). Yes I could use SQL and Web to create easier database of coupons, but that would presume for this company creating from scratch the coupon balances system, the system of salaries accounting, the system of salaries, the coupon uniquenes check &amp; databases, user accounts system - this is kinda very easy task for experienced programmers, but still a lots of days of development, because its the whole CRM. Why bother, when you can do all of this easier and in much more secure manner with Bitcoin APIs? I found doing the same tasks with Bitcoin even easier than I did this previously for other customers from scratch (we don't have really good products ready to use box systems in our country), because Bitcoin has its all.
3) The business owner now pre-fills arbitrary coupon codes which he wants to sell to its customers (He has a discount if someone purchase 10 coupons - so basically customer purchases 10 Bitcoin private keys with fiat). Next time customer comes with the code "238741" for receiving 1 unit of service, non-technical stuff uses mentioned above brainwallet-based form to generate private-key from passphrase (we've changed the algorithm for internal uses, and basically keep it securely hidden on our servers, so don't worry about such easy passphrases, they are only seem easy to bruteforce, in fact we use strong master-passwords combined with friendly to customers coupon numbers)
4) When coupon codes for the service are redeemed, our script automatically logs that change &amp; fills our employees with their salaries (fixed fees per service performed)
Disadvantages of such system:
1) Customers &amp; stuff never aware that they are using Bitcoin.
2) But they are using it with coupons &amp; coupons usually represent very small values of BTC transferred from 1 BTC-address to another (Basically we use ledger of Bitcoin for accounting purposes for the business)
3) We have to keep in secret our master-passwords, Bitcoin addresses, and this whole thing's health is totally destroyed if someone finds out the Bitcoin addresses of our employees :) But we can keep our employees Bitcoin addresses in secret even from employees (by keeping coupon generation process server-side), because this can cause unauthorized transactions from the smart employees who'll find out how to use Bitcoin (but that's part of my goal that someone will try to find out how to use Bitcoin this way :)) Basically what happens when employee tries to trick system by sending transaction on his work-address from his anonymous address, we are instantly seeing that his BTC address is comprimised whether by him or somebody else &amp; the whole history is pruned &amp; moved to new secret BTC address for accounting purposes.

This is getting out of hand. Stop talking local when it comes to different exchanges.
I live in Russia and LocalBitcoins is the only way to exchange Bitcoins here. I will never use btc-e because it accepts only Yandex.Money. All the other exchanges requires too much documents &amp; not user friendly. 
Yes I know that LocalBitcoins keeps your Bitcoins during exchange but you can pretty much withdraw them immediately after exchanging. On btc-e sometimes it takes for days to withdraw your funds, their web-site is very inconvenient - no variety of payments systems offered and you're always facing some sorts of limits, document checks. Screw that.
LocalBitcoins.com never had any problem transfering my funds from one payment system to another.

Bitcoin covers many properties &amp; even much more reliable than any of the paper money. I don't think that you would expect free "Euro" or free "Dollar", that's why there's no such thing as free Bitcoin - because currently we have only those Bitcoin holded by real people. Most of those real people purchased their Bitcoins for real money.
In my opinion Bitcoin is not worse than gold by its reliability for the same reason: because no one can get free gold (mining gold is a very difficult process, nobody can fool this process) and Bitcoin is great because you can't even mine Bitcoins anymore - and mathamatical software rules is protecting that (No one can hack this, because of cryptography)
So that's why its pretty much like real gold - you won't expect anyone giving you away any free gold. But you can work for gold.
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:49:03
currently there is 2 types of wallets exists in Bitcoin ecosystem:
- 1) Single Address Keys Storage Wallets
- 2) Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets
Hierarchical Deterministic mobile/web/computer wallet program will ask you to memorize 12 words, which will be the root security method of accessing your funds from any device without any limitations.
Another way to find out that wallet is Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) is when each time you are pressing "Receive funds" in the program UI, hd-wallets are usually use multiple addresses to receive funds (usually each time new address per transaction). Since you're concerned about privacy, HD is a good choice, and in this case your main password is that 12 words (you can save them on paper).
On the PC &amp; in blockchain.info there is single keys used. This is my personal choice (because I don't care about privacy &amp; I need more transparency/simplicity). In this case I store my private keys in a safe place (not only on blockchain.info, even though I use their web wallet).
Even though UX is personal preferrence, I think blockchain.info has pretty good web wallet - but of course as an additional security measure - go to import section &amp; see your private keys to write them down on paper or to save them on your encrypted disk (this advice for expert users only).
Also reliable way to generate your private keys - is using offline (not connected to internet computer). The easiest way to generate your open/private key pair on offline computer is downloading zip file from bitaddress.org (online open source javascript code which lets you generate addresses in a secure manner).
But bitaddress.org could be dangerous when you generate paper wallets based on passphrase (brain wallet or smart wallet) if you don't see difference between  good passphrase or poor passphrase. SHA-256 is the easy algorithm to bruteforce so your brain wallet passphrase must be very secure &amp; very unpredictible (upper/lower case, all special characters used, not less than 15 chars, not using any words existing in vocabulary)

Yes, I already wrote before on Reddit (I am not the first time opening thread about LocalBitcoins here) that in the mother Russia transaction reverses you! I mean no chargebacks allowed even for Visa/MasterCard, because when they try to introduce this to Russian customer - Russian customer always having a free meals &amp; other freebies because Russians love neglecting chargeback systems to their benefit. (I think economically this phenomenon even has its name forgot how to say that word ... I think its called "excessive rates of fraud", here's the usage of this term on PayPal's official web-site "PayPal has limited its services to exclude countries and regions that are known to have excessively high rates of credit card fraud.")

If the value of dollars rise 50% in a week, then I should first buy a dollar (at 2x price!! why would I purchase such a useless currency so expensive?!), then with a purchased dollar I should buy a chocolate bar, now I'm getting my chocolate bar at a double price. And that makes a dollar volatile, not Bitcoin. Do you understand what a non-sense you're saying?!
If some fool want to get double price for their dollar, what am I to do ett, stoopid?

Man your platform is really huge &amp; awesome. I believe you should
- start accepting Bitcoin donations
- insert changetip button for every author so that your subtitles-makers could receive donations over changetip **by default** without even knowing about Bitcoin.
- use Bitcoin's micropayments to introduce your users ability to crowdfund subtitles / to pay for subtitles with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has very easy API &amp; very helpful community when it comes to integration. Bitcoin is a first global money, so you can enjoy Bitcoin's userbase who are by the way the biggest developers community &amp; probably the best way to find traget audience for this project.
- All Bitcoin members are interested in bringing Bitcoin videos translations into all languages! Your project would let people translate more videos &amp; store them in a very convenient way (the way YouTube doesn't work)
- Create your own topic on once you achieved something in Bitcoin integration, and receive love(a lots of new users from huge community)!

I searched for such platform. I will definitely try your solution &amp; will try to provide fullest review here if I will find your platform convenient to share videos with people.
Currently without any deep knowledge about  I could find it useful at least for providing backup &amp; reliable place to hold the subtitles for video.
I have a question: do you support Bitcoin in any form? (do u know anything about Bitcoin? do u accept Bitcoin donations? do u plan introducing some Bitcoin features to your web-site e.g. premium subtitles paid for with Bitcoin? do u have any bitcoin related projects?)

Yes, its a good idea to add English subtitles, but for translation of subtitles you don't need to have any basis like English subtitles, because YouTube has convenient option for auto-translating. So I download auto-translated srt file and import it into Russian section, after that I'm using YouTube's online Creator Studio to arrange it.

@_date: 2015-07-24 10:24:37


No I used online interface of YouTube. Before watching this  - I thought that YouTube don't have convenient tools for subtitles. But I was wrong. YouTube **has everything**!


Would be a good thing if authors could respond appropriately, but I afraid its a double job to get done. If there wouldn't be any other solution, then perhaps this could be the only way to go. Right now this sounds as an odd bureaucracy. What is the best way to contact authors?
It would be way more better if instead authors would contacted me to remove videos. I think I've got a strategy now: I will hope that strikes won't hit me. But in case if authors will contact me, I'll remove for only that videos for which authors don't want to spread the word about Bitcoin, other videos will remain on a channel. If the whole channel will be shutdown, we will find another place, if that place will be shut down we will find the another place.


Basically user have to press [CC] for subtitles to appear on the screen. If the official channel won't put any annotation, regularly a user won't know that there's a subtitles. So there's two sides of user experience: 1) you don't want to put any annotations into official videos; 2) its not obvious that user will notice Russian language. So concerning this one: perhaps creating some central list of videos on some fancy web-site might help. But I don't have plan on developing any fancy web-sites, so I would put it somewhere e.g. in Russian subreddit @_date: 2015-07-12 20:00:12

I've created this topic on reddit with 2 purposes:
1) to emphasize, show everyone that creating subtitles is very easy, so that you could do it for your own country &amp; your own language.
Usually it takes from 30 to 90 minutes to translate 1 video, but it makes a great deal for everyone who needs more information about Bitcoin, not just some text available in your language. I believe qualitative content in every language is what each subject lacks, including Bitcoin. Watching YouTube videos is fun way to learn about new things. I believe videos to be the best way to provide all necessary information for the person to get involved in a Bitcoin community
2) I have question for anyone who had experience running the same projects: how big probability is that my channel would be totally shutdown for a copyright violation? I've heard YouTube has so-called 3 copyright alerts before they shutdown your channel completely without giving you access to uploaded videos and hence subtitles too.
My question is should I make backups for the subtitles somewhere else for the case if they going to shutdown my channel.
And the other question - is there any alternative ways to improve subtitles without "reuploading"?

There is few ways.
1) I have subreddit called  - it is dedicated for submitting, proposing and ranking new videos for translation, so if you have some ideas for which next videos should be translated, you could suggest me what I could do.
My ultimate goal is getting done 3-4 videos each day! But reality is that some videos are too good, but too long (like that one with Wences Caesars which lasts 14 minutes - it took 4 hours of my time to get this video done, which almost my daily limit of free time).
2) The routine process of translating YouTube video begins with downloading automatic English subtitles and deleting too short subtitles. If this job could be done by someone else or automated, this could increase my productivity.
Also at the end of translation is done there's 2 actions needed to be done:
- Subtitles timing has to be adjusted again, it can be done without language knowledge, just some optimizations according to each subtitle length. Everything is done through YouTube's online editor.
- The authors of the original video should receive a comment with subtitles uploaded to file-sharing service, so that they also could have a chance to include subtitles file into their original video.
3) Start your own channel in any other language by watching this tutorial: 
4) Help to improve our main Russian subreddit:  (subscribe!) it has status of international subreddit, so you can even comment in English for any content, create your topics/publish your links there in English and can participate in voting. This actions will make a good visibility for other participants, that this place is alive. Because subreddit is not very active and most Russian users still using old outdated technologies like Bitcoins-forum to share and find Bitcoin news, while they totally reject reddit, because they think that reddit isn't designed for Russia (but Reddit do have Russian interface!) I believe Reddit to be the same shocking innovation like Bitcoin, but it is better than forums, because it has tree-structure of discussion and voting mechanism. 
Several power Bitcoin users in Russia already supporting &amp; investing amounts of money to bring new users this subreddit from other Bitcoin-resources, but its still looks empty. 2 days ago luke-jr created some topic there ;)

Found you again accidentally while surfing reddit. When I open a youtube video over Telegram, with AdBlock in Safari on my iPhone, its somewhat better than native YouTube client. Current Telegram API offers rich capabilities e.g. to build bots for Bitcoin, which could be used to build tools for monetizing videos. Maybe the future of video monetization is not desktop and not mobile, but future is cross-platformed service as app: Telegram?
Also may I ask what do you think about bringing donations to offline videos? In a poor countries people still pay a lot for the Internet. We can't wait a payments from such poor people, but even poorest family could afford paying $0.10 for 100 videos.

We burn Bitcoins everyday we don't create new Bitcoins. When mining rewards halves it reduces the Bitcoin inflation which almost equals to burning Bitcoins, because if community of 10 people need to ship 10 products monthly &amp; their GDP is 1 BTC, when to this virtual GDP you add up some more people, they already using 10 BTC on a monthly basis, which means collaborative (hot potato) hoarding, which means that 9 BTC is burned. Instead of burning 9 BTC you could distribute this wealth among poor.
Basically speaking, burning calories doesn't help burning Bitcoins.

I understand that these changes are making Bitcoin better, and this is part of "network effect" and "path-dependancy".
But doesn't this changes also means that all the other cryptocurrencies would benefit from copying and forking current release and keeping adopting all those changes in order to be fresh on bugs/etc and other fundamental flaws that have to be fixed?
Along with "network effect" I very often hear from Bitcoin proponents that someone who will want to create "better" Bitcoin, will have to repeat all these "bug fixes" which Bitcoin endured during 6 years of "path". But wait, can't this imaginary "better Bitcoin"escape that loop by inheriting the code the way so that all bug fixes would apply to "new cryptocurrency" code too? Better marketed than Bitcoin, have more fair share distribution (e.g. implementing basic income idea or more equal and fair wealth allocation, or being lobbied by some huge corporation or several corporations), and at the same time using &amp; inheriting the same source code base? Does that (keeping the same code structure while following other monetary policy) even possible?

Beginning developers could contribute significant impact to Bitcoin. Do you realize that success of Bitcoin on 95% depend on beginning developers? (because they are the ones who one day can upgrade themselves to the next level of building or investing into advanced businesses for Bitcoin)
Beginning developers in developing countries could be the ones who have guts to stop doing their main job and start focusing on their little Bitcoin project. And these people need your support but your message to them is:


I know you were talking about beginning developers in big companies. But then it doesn't make sense, because big companies usually don't hire beginning developers. Most beginning developers work on individual projects like small games, small exchange platforms, some other services which has less than 100 signed up users. 
If we will keep ignoring small developers long enough, then one day they will quit doing what they love. And that's a big loss for Bitcoin. I saw this happening with many programmers I know from my country.

Correct. I wasn't trying to hide this fact. But it has a some things in common with Bitcoin. I can say at least that QIWI systems are closer to Bitcoin than Visa\MasterCard system.
How QIWI is closer? Because using Visa\MasterCard you can't setup Bitcoin payments.


1% fee is a bitch? Come on. There's more odds that you'll feel volatility in Bitcoin than this tiny 1%. For such a great replacement for Visa/MasterCard. If Bitcoin is alternative currency for fiat. QIWI/WM/Yandex.Money/Sberbank.Online is decent user-to-user alternatives to current dominant Visa/MasterCard payment systems
1% is a great reward to these systems for Bitcoin merchant adoption


Nope, I don't need a contract to do so. Without being a company on a user basis I can send 60,000 RUR (~$1,000) per day to as many merchants as I want. And if I will fully identificate myself, I can send 600,000 RUR (~$10,000) per day to any merchants and I if someone will ask why I send so much money, I can say "I'm shopping". You don't believe that I can spend that much? Give me your money, I'll prove :)
Now imagine what you can do with a network of 10 users cooperating for identification, with 10 cooperating users you can achieve volume of $100,000 per day(!). Isn't that a paradise for Bitcoin? Script as much as you want, I guarantee you.
Just admit that you just can't think out of the box :D

Most important thing is freedom.
Ridiculous argument. Your way of thinking is the reason for all bureaucratic and freedom-limiting systems. Following your logic Google's Gmail should've introduce $10 fee to create 1 email. My family here in Russia can't afford buying 1kg sugar, because then my family will have to cut the budget for something else - and we're not alone - I know many people who live like us, and many other countries where people have such budget (that's why we have rule to buy 50kg sugar and 50kg flour and other wholesale products in wallmart-size wholesale stores). What the heck of $1 or $10 dollars you're talking about?!?!?

I know that PayPal banned payments to many countries due to high fraud rates but with Egypt its cheaper and easier than Bitcoin (because basically right now everybody needs dollars and USD to BTC to USD conversion will take double comission when you're exchanging to and from Bitcoins)

Bitcoin version of Transcript *few words replaced marked by Italic*: "I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your *monetary supply* and I realized that you're not actually using *money*. Every *person* on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you *banksters* do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. *Fiat money* are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and **Bitcoins** are the cure."

Yes it takes miners to confirm transactions, but you don't need to be a miner to verify the history or where does your coin belongs. Bitcoin uses cryptography, and the whole principle is easy to check, but impossible to counterfeit.
Yes it takes miners to confirm transactions, but miners can't change your transaction - metaphorically speaking miners only **have permission** to put a timestamp (assign block) on your transaction - so basically speaking they are telling that transaction "A" belongs to let's say block 301301. And even if you create transaction "B" within the same funds, miners will easily find out which of transactions had timestamp first, and that's the role of the miner - to define whether transaction A valid or transaction B was timestamped faster in the first place in the cases of interference.

When BitQuick.co will become available in Russia?
@_date: 2015-03-25 10:37:30
In Russia very few people heard about Bitcoin, but I see two supreme category of people:
1) Those who **never** heard of life-changing topics, self-help, business opportunities, investment opportunities, multi-level marketing, leadership, technical fields. Of course this is 70% of people who're not thinking about changing their life. You never will be able to explain Bitcoin to this people.
2) The other intelligent people who heard about those subjects and still believe into themselves. This is a narrow active 30% group. More and more people starting to appear all around the different places of Russia, of different ages and they aware of system. This folks care. When I find people for Bitcoin club, I'm trying to find such active people, they are very active on our events, and they are ready to listen and learn. And this is not only young people, very often I see very interested 30 and 40 years old people who willing to learn. And they do amazing things based on Bitcoin. 
**Bitcoin is a legitimate substitute to fiat.**

This book categorized several payment categories, and gave silly name "E-Cash" to distinguish IT payment systems usage for retail purposes. While for U.S., visa and mastercard transactions also should be considered some sort of e-cash, because it involves virtual money to be used as 90% of all transactions happening in the retail sector of U.S.
E-cash is the king offline and online, while they consider e-commerce undeveloped, they miss out that e-commerce itself is part of offline purchases too. Author writes "debit card works like a paper check", while I'm facepalming that statement, because debit card works like central electronic payment system for me. Economics supposed to be precise science like math, but according to given descriptions it sounds like knowledge about economy is irrational experience like psychology.
Can anyone tell me, what's wrong with me or with approaches?

It means that 1% is not a lot for my average amounts of transaction.
$10,000 is a lot, 1% is not a lot. $10 out of $1000 is not a lot.
If you spend $990 every day is it a lot? I think its a lot. If you're paying just $10 for spending $990, I think its ridiculously small amount. Of course if you need to spend $1980 per day, it means that you have to spend $20 for transaction. Well, that's already a lots of spending per day, but still quite normal fee ($20).
I'm defending 1% fees, because 5% is considered good amount of fee for exchanging fiat into Bitcoins in Russia. That's why people in Russia don't aapreciate Bitcoin. Because in Russia we've got smart networks which works on your dumb phone (through SMS) to provide you service which you can use to move your funds from one Russian user to another Russian user for 1% of fee or without fee very often. And that's considered a good service.

yeah I got that point, and I appreciate it, but its still a transaction. Its not okay to wait 24-48 hours, but its still a transaction, and it teaches user than 10 cent transactions with low mining fee are slow. The faster user gonna learn it, the faster he'll acquire the knowledge about how the fees work and why this is happening. Next time he's gonna laugh about 10 cent ChangeTip.
I'm 3 years in Bitcoin and already not using any cash (I pay a lot of money to my suppliers in Russia to accomplish this and use chains of my friends-intermediaries for special purposes), but I never had a chance to figure out slowness of $0.10 transaction :( Because you didn't gave me that chance by sending $5 instead of beloved my $0.10. And I'm not trolling. Understand me. All money is money.

I think Bitcoin is the type of innovation which will create something which will replace "PayPal" &amp; it will make to that boss obvious that yes, it is "PayPal" that is the most convenient/fast stuff.

I even have my own piggy bank method in Bitcoin - I generate random locks like 329093, 679042, 129109, 91063, (using brainwallet passphrase) then I forget those numbers, I do it on purpose, so that I wouldn't even able to spend it randomly. Only when there will be 999999 payments made, it will be relatively easy to spend + at that time Bitcoin rate will be astronomically high.

I'm not saying that my brainwallet passphrases are exactly 6-digits "542892". This is not the first time I'm posting this type of stuff for the public &amp; everybody here saying that its stupid. But in fact, this is my savings advice to you. You should do the same.
Its not stupid. Listen to me. I've written the script where I created my own complicated algorithm that generates VERY SECURE passphrase (which looks like private key) will be used as a base to generate Brain Wallet address. This complicated algorithm I've "invented" allows something like "bicycle locks", but these locks are available only to me, and they are secured from outer world, because the locks contain exactly 999999 combinations &amp; its some sort of virtual obstacle I've created to secure the funds from myself. (I can't find them easily, in order to do this I will have to try all 999999 combinations which sounds for me like very complicated combination)
I know that if I'll need these funds back, all I need to do is bruteforce my own secure phrases from 000000 to 999999. But meanwhile I've made around 100 payments ($10 each), and its not even close to 999999. I'll be close to 10000 payments at the end of the retirement, so its going to be something like $10 * 10000 = $100,000 hidden in depth of my secure brainwallets. I'm hiding these funds for retirement. And I do it **offline** for a very long-secure phrases.
Before using this method I was saving on a single offline Bitcoin address. Its not very secure way to have your own savings. I was spending my savings very often. Because Bitcoins are very easy to spend, and there's just too much places appearing where you can spend your Bitcoins which increases temptation to do so.

@_date: 2016-05-13 21:50:29
The process of unlocking contracts are very important. This might sounds just like some nerdy stuff, but its actually one of the biggest systemic obstacles for making apps in Bitcoin more trustless.
"Mature security systems will be undertaking different behavior for different contracts. To continue with our example, if the automobile contract were a lease, the final payment would switch off leasee access; for purchase on credit, it would switch off creditor access. A security system, by successive redesign, increasingly approaches the logic of the contract which governs the rights and obligations covering the object, information, or computation being secured. Qualitatively different contractual terms, as well as technological differences in the property, give rise to the need for different protocols." Nick Szabo

Such a shame and waste of time. I can't believe that in 2015 we still haven't found the way to prove that you're accepting Bitcoin.
