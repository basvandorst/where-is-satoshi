Part of it is that younger people should be investing riskier, which is definitely Bitcoin.

I would be more worried about having to use the Internet in general on Mars. Bitcoin transactions shouldn't be a problem because if Mars were to be colonized there would be some sort of escrow service set up for transactions on Mars' own Internet that would say broadcast all daily transactions to Earth. I would be more worried about using the Internet in general.

That was a nice speech but I don't think it's exactly what he was going for

Question: excluding any involvement with Bitcoin, is there anything fraudulent or wrong with the service? I never used it for Bitcoin and personally like it because I can send money to friends with no fees instantly.

Ever heard of Margaret Hamilton?

My guess is that he's screwing people over so they use bitcoin to gain financial aid and then sell it to live. For example, people in airports don't have easy access to money while they are stuck there, loved ones can send them bitcoin and then they can sell it/use it in the airport. That's small scale but still...

No, it's a social science. However, computer science is considered a science.

He's not complaining about it. He is pointing out that using one of several payment systems (visa, MasterCard, etc.) In conjunction with banks makes payments a slow process, and he's right.

From my understanding, most other cryptocurrencies are based off of bitcoin.

At least you didnt pay 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza!

There isn't less incentive to spend. This is because we dont know what the price will be. If anything it leads to discounts when paying with bitcoin which I have seen on some websites. Not to mention I would rather have my currency increase in value over time rather than decrease.
