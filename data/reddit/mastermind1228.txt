You do realize NASA and the US government are SpaceX's largest customers?  Jeff Bezos has chosen to use his incredible fortune to build Blue Origin.  Why do you use SpaceX as an example and not Blue Origin.  SpaceX uses Tax dollars while Blue Orgin does not.    
The fundamental issue is UBI provided by a GOVERNMENT and UBI provided by an individual, which you seem to just gloss over with your nonsensical rhetoric.  


In this case, the money from this UBI cause was NOT taken against their will, it was in fact DONATED.  You are criticizing their donation because it does not follow your rigid political view of the world.  
My neighbor needs help to pay his health insurance bill.  I should not help him because I would be giving him a "handout."  
With your logic, it's my money, I should be free to do what I want to do with it- maybe HELP some other people. 


"constitutional conservatives" - you are acting as if the U.S. is the ONLY country in the world.  The fact of the matter is, there are over 190+ OTHER COUNTRIES  who don't have "constitutional conservatism" and have socialized healthcare.  In fact, some of those countries have a very successful "socialized healthcare" program that has not led to "tyranny".

Let's also acknowledge that I live in the U.S. There are homeless people living under bridges down the street from me.  What has a free market done for these individuals?  
So what you are suggesting is that if I see a homeless individual while walking home, I should just ignore him/her because the free market is going to take care of it.  That person may be mentally retarded, mentally ill, or just down on luck.  
I do not understand what makes you so uncomfortable and scared of "UBI."  If you read the article, someone who has made a tremendous amount of money is experimenting with the concept of providing extremely impoverished communities with "Universal Basic Income" 
They will also be using another 100 communities as a control group to see the effect.  
You seem to have a better plan, why don't you use your vast amount of wealth that you have generated from cryptocurrencies and implement a better strategy rather than be dismissive of people who are trying to make a difference in the world.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.GS +2.59% looked deep into its crystal ball and saw space travel, flash crashes and bitcoin’s blockchain.
Those were three of the seven “themes, dreams and flying machines” the bank flagged in a note to clients Wednesday, as the company highlighted some emerging trends that it said need to be on the radar for investors.
The seven topics Goldman explores: how the blockchain could disrupt everything, a new frontier in space, the value of college, the effect of America’s youngest cohort Gen Z, the likelihood of another Flash Crash, lithium as the new gasoline and how the cloud can help cure cancer.
1 Blockchain’s prospects. Goldman writes that there are expectations that the blockchain could revolutionize “everything,” though roadblocks remain. The blockchain, which is the digital public ledger underlying bitcoin, is these days “taking center stage” from the currency it was supposed to support, Goldman wrote. It’s “promising an ushering in of a new set of tools to cut costs and challenge the profit poll of the middle-man with a promise to make centralized institutions obsolete.” In doing so, it has the potential to make interactions quicker, less expensive and safer.
In addition to bitcoin’s blockchain, Goldman said there are growing sets of private and permission-driven shared ledgers gaining traction and worth focusing on. But, like any new technology, the bank added that the hype cycle is building with no real legislative or regulatory framework.
2 Space race heats up. To infinity and beyond? The space race is reigniting and Goldman said it sees investment opportunities. “As the barrier and costs to deploying space technologies are lowered, we believe [aerospace and defense] companies will see accelerated growth in their space business lines, while commercial satellite operators may be disrupted by lower-cost alternatives,” wrote Goldman analyst Noah Poponak.
3 Is college worth it? Amid rising costs and dismal wage growth, the average return on college is falling. Goldman said that, for the typical student, the number of years to break even on the cost of college has grown to nine today from eight in 2010. If current costs and wage growth persist, Goldman said students starting college in 2030 will have to wait 11 years post school to break even.
There’s increasing unmet demand for specialized, or skilled, work. But Goldman said the labor market is moving faster than education, broadly speaking, can respond. Because of that, it sees “clear growth” opportunities in professional training programs via LinkedIn Corp.LNKD +0.86%, Coursera and edX.
4 Tapping in to Gen Z. As the oldest Gen Z’ers enter their mid- to late-teens, Goldman said this cohort will soon surpass Millenials in size and that their influence is already evident. The group is the most diverse to date, digital is at its core and it’s decidedly financially conservative, according to Goldman analyst Christopher Wolf. “While not the first generation of youths with a desire to be heard, Gen-Z is arguably the first with the means,” he added.
5 More flash crashes in store? Goldman said that while investors have become more used to greater volatility, the specter of another flash crash happening is top of mind for people. Recently, on Aug. 24, the stock market didn’t fully open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time as liquidity issues and selling pressure in the futures market spilled over into the stock market. When stocks did open, many securities traded off sharply and the largest number of Limit Up Limit Down trading halts to date were triggered.
6 Lithium’s increasing use. Take a look at Tesla Motors Inc.'sTSLA -1.00% stock over the past few years, and you’ll see a lot of hype around battery-powered electric vehicles. Against this backdrop, Goldman said that the unique properties of lithium position it for portable energy storage applications that “will be a key enabler of the electric car revolution and replace gasoline as the primary source of transportation fuel.”
Lithium is the earth’s lightest solid element with double the energy density of the next closest alternative. It is one of the most abundant elements on earth too.
7 Cancer’s cure: the cloud? The last topic Goldman looks at is how the cloud has the potential to improve cancer treatment over the next decade. “Rapid reductions in cloud storage costs and [better] DNA sequencing technology will soon merge with the proliferation of electronic medical records to enable a new paradigm in cancer treatment,” wrote Goldman analyst Isaac Ro.
Mr. Ro said the combination of lower cloud costs, improved DNA sequencing and the increase in electronic medical records should make it easier for physicians to analyze data and assess individual patient treatment options. For drug companies and scientists, it should cause them to develop drugs faster and cheaper. And for payers, the emergence of electronic medical records should help them better allocate health-care spend for both preventative and ongoing treatment-based applications.

Ok, so when a Billionaire Investor buys into Bitcoin and drives the fiat prices up, early adopters see value increase.  So yes, there is a very large redistribution of wealth.  Called it socialism, or whatever your like.  
Bitcoin is many things.  The focus should always be helping make the world a better place for everyone.   
No it's not. It's always been about modernizing currency, controlling your own money, and a product of such is taking the power from the banks.
I am not disagreeing with this.  After we control our own money, take power from banks, modernize currency what we do with that freedom and power is most important.  
Buying a lambo should not be the dream of every bitcoiner.

Let's say some large investor wants to invest $10 million in Bitcoin.  The problem is, once invested, the price will only rise a small amount.  It will then correct itself back to the price it currently is.  (i.e. the price will go to $350, before falling back down to $320).  The person who has now invested $10 Million, has now taken a substantial loss.  If the investor were to break a certain price limit, it would sky rocket.
Nobody wants to be the first to make that move, due to the risk of loosing much.

Have you ever bought Bitcoin in the past? 
If no, please buy maybe $10 of bitcoin and see how comfortable you are.  If you feel comfortable with it, invest a little more.  Repeat as needed.
If yes and you are comfortable, consider buying a constant amount over an extended period of time.  This will mitigate your risk. 
Whatever you do, do not do anything drastic.  I don't recommend liquidating your IRA, especially of you have never owned a few millibits.

I think Dogecoin is a very good thing for Bitcoin/Crypto.  Dogecoin may initially seem like a scam or a pump and dump due to the fact that there is 100 Billion of them.  Dogecoin is a great thing for bringing new cypto-users on bored.  Buying a few Satoshi's isn't all that easy for new users and Dogecoin is a great stepping stone for Bitcoin.  People are able to buy a couple thousand Dogecoins for a few dollars and watch it with very little risk.  
This way, they are able to easily participate in the growing cryptomarkets.  The hope is to educate them enough to then consider investing in Bitcoin.  It also appeals to the "snapchat" generation (As I like to call them)
I like to think of Dogecoin in the same way that people use "virtual stock portfolios"  You are able to play around with stocks without worrying about loosing money.  When you are comfortable enough, you will buy into the real market.  
Until people understand what a Millibit, Microbit, or Satoshi is, Dogecoin is an easy to understand alternative

Please enlighten me.  Call the credit card company to authorize the transaction?  What are these "well known procedures?" We have dozens of gift card transaction a week.  I bet you anything, no customer would wait until we call the company.  You are still missing the point.  This could have been ANYTHING we sell at our store.  Gift Cards just happened to be what was sold.  The customer could have bought $250 worth of drinks and charged it back.    


Let me rephrase.  It WAS erased.  I knew this, so I didn't even bother.  It was over a month, I know for a fact my camera system wouldn't have the recording.  I also had a signed receipt, I didn't expect the merchant processing company to deny it.     


This has a lot to do with bitcoin. Charge-backs are a very very common problem.  In addition to having to pay a 2% transaction fee, I have to deal with things like this.  90% of my customers pay with credit cards.  People don't realize how horrible credit cards are for merchants.  Hence why there are companies (Sams club, Aldi) who do not accept credit cards.  Ever been somewhere with a sign that says "cash only" - Ever wonder why?

There are so many things wrong with this article, I don't even know where to begin.  
1) Nobody is "trusting" ghash (or any other mining pool).  If they were to "double spend" it would be like shooting themselves in the foot. 
2) Bitcoin can survive with or without ghash approaching 51%.  Right now, early on, it would be better to not have any single mining pool control that much to strengthen the network.  It will ensure competition amongst pools and prevent future monopolistic mining pools (monopolies/oligopolies are something very common in the oil industry, telecoms, etc)

If you take 1% (merchant processing fees) of $500,000- it is $5,000.  If you take 2% of $500,000- it is $10,000.  If nothing else, we can assume Overstock saved on their merchant services by utilizing Bitcoin.  This is on top of whatever increase in sales they may have had.  What did it cost them- a few lines of code in the checkout section of their website?  Someone please point out the downside? (and if you say 'volatility' I mind rip my hair out)

Yes, past price cannot predict the future price, however there is a clear growth trend here.  It appears to be increasing around 10x every 11 months. Now the question is: [when] will it stop?
I also think there is an exact formula Bitcoin is approaching that directly links Hash rate, price (or volume traded), and number of wallets.  If anyone of these goes out of check, it self corrects.  Whoever can figure out this formula will win the Noble Price in Bitcoinomics.

Historically speaking, this has only happened in the middle of a bubble -when buying interest exceeds selling interest.  I guess if more people are buying Bitcoin's than selling, it will hurt the Dollar.
In the long run, putting a hold on Bitcoin buying will help Bitcoin.  Coinbase users are still freely able to sell 50 Bitcoins for Dollars.  Over time, there will be more demand and Bitcoin holders can rest assured that they can receive Dollars for Bitcoins (greater liquidity). 
The one major area of concern is the fact that Coinbase is the only exchange that users can link to their bank accounts (in the U.S.).  Anyone else see this as a problem or do people think that the P2P aspect of Bitcoin will work itself out?

I feel this news is not just important due to the size of DISH (market cap), but because what it could shortly develop to.  Contrary to what people think about DISH Network, they are not just a satellite TV provider, they are also heavily involved with selling content.  
In 2011, DISH network bought the bankrupt Blockbuster chain, put themselves in direct competition with Netflix.  **While we have all been waiting for Netflix to accept Bitcoin, DISH Network and (former) Blockbuster have quietly derived up a strategy to sell content utilizing Micropayments.** 
Sure, DISH Network accepting Bitcoin for paying cable bills is great- They are the largest player to do even that.  Selling content for Satoshis/Bits would be even bigger.

See with stocks and such, people are constantly changing things within the company. (i.e. hiring/firing employees, buying/selling assets)  As a reflection, the prices fluctuate as determined by the market.  
With Bonds, the face value is always the same, the interest rate is what changes.  That determines the price.    
Bitcoin does not change the core protocol (developers just add to it).  Therefore if it was working last year, it will probably work better next year.  That will be the reflection of growth we will see.  I think it is more reasonable to say the price at some point in the future will hit $1000 rather than saying in X months the price will be $1000.  
Therefore yes, past price is not an exact indicator for future growth.  We can tell what *will* [most probably] happen, we just can't say *when* it will happen.

So a simple answer to this would be to look at someone who bought 10,000+ bitcoins a few years ago.  For them spending 1 or 2 bitcoin wouldnt even make a dent in thier holdings.  
It comes down to the fact that money is meant to be spent.  Without spending money, it would be worthless.  How much money is enough for someone is Dependant on the individual.  
10,000 * $900= $9 million dollars.

Hundreds of banks are jumping on the mobile payments bandwagon – via Apple. Our colleague Robin Sidel wrote that debit-card and credit-card companies are getting on board “hoping to keep a tight grip on customers” who might scamper off if they find their cards incompatible with Apple’s system. Meanwhile, Alipay, the payments company that processes many of Alibaba’s transactions and a pretty big company in its own right, signed up its 190 millionth user, its 190 millionth active user. That’s up from 100 million in late 2013.

I feel this news is not just important due to the size of DISH (market cap), but because what it could shortly develop to. Contrary to what people think about DISH Network, they are not just a satellite TV provider, they are also heavily involved with selling content.
In 2011, DISH network bought the bankrupt Blockbuster chain, put themselves in direct competition with Netflix. While we have all been waiting for Netflix to accept Bitcoin, DISH Network and (former) Blockbuster have quietly derived up a strategy to sell content utilizing Micropayments.
Sure, DISH Network accepting Bitcoin for paying cable bills is great- They are the largest player to do even that. Selling content for Satoshis/Bits would be even bigger.

The foundation is involved in digital money but unlike Bitcoin it would not be anonymous digital money. In Kenya M-pesa is being used for almost half of all transactions. Digital money has low transaction costs which is great for the poor because they need to do financial transactions with small amounts of money. Over the next 5 years I think digital money will catch on in India and parts of Africa and help the poorest a lot.

Please, understand what you are getting yourself into.  What you are seeing happening here has happened time and time again.  Be mentally prepared for the price to go below $1000 tomorrow.  If you are looking to make a nice return, be prepared to wait decades.    
The best strategy when buying bitcoin is buy a specific amount over a set time period  For example, rather than buying $10,000 worth of coins, purchase $500/week for 20 weeks.

@_date: 2017-11-16 17:31:16
I have done everyone a favor and converted this twitter barrage into one consolidated source:
1/ The TRUTH behind  child porn tweet, deletion, and subsequent cover up. (
2/ Before, I begin I'd like to state that I don't believe Vitalik realistically supports child porn legalization, he was speaking in hypotheticals. However, I do believe this is a great example pf his immaturity, poor judgement, and political nature.
3/ Traits that manifest themselves in Ethereum's fatally flawed design and completely arbitraty governance culture. Consider this a TRIGGER WARNING for large ETH investors that have been duped by the Vitalik cult of personality.
4/ Oh yeah, DISCLOSURE: I recently entered into a short ETH/BTC position once I realized how fallible Vitalik is and how the false narrative that he's super rational and infallible keeps the  ETH charade going. A project that has raised billions w/o shipping anything that works.
5/ To understand the present, you need to understand the past. Everything in ETHlandia went wrong after the infamous DAO hack. (
6/ The DAO was an economically and technically flawed project that assumed the crowd could pool ETH and vote on projects that would generate cashflow returns and increase the value of the ETH ecosystem. aka "the wisdom of the crowd" aka "socialism".
7/ The boy Genius actually invested in this economicslly incoherent idea revealing how little he knows about real world economics. The economic illiteracy here was only overshadowed by the technical illiteracy.
8/ This was revealed when the DAO "hacker" exploited a vulnerability in the code that allowed her to withdraw millions of dollar in ether invested in the DAO to a child DAO she controlled.
9/ The Ethereum platform was marketed as a platform that creates "unstoppable applications" impervious to censorship because "code is law."
10/ However, when Vitalik and his friends that invested in the DAO's money was on the line as well as they're planned future transition to "proof of stake," they decided to reneg on their marketing promises and censor the hackers transaction by the forking protocol...
11/ and stealing the hackers rightly owned funds (she just executed the code) to return to dumb investors creating a precedent for protocol censorship, bailouts, and moral hazard.
12/ More critically, Vitalik implicated that he was the leader of Ethereum and that it was indeed centralized by single handedly getting exchanges to halt trading to stop the hacker from liquidating. (
13/ Vitalik was able to manipulate the trading of what the SEC later called a security. Also accordingly to the SEC, if ETH was created today, it too would also be considered a security. Lucky for them, unlike the DAO, the SEC can arbitrarily enforce rules. (
14/ Subsequent to that fiasco. It was revealed that Vitalik had been taking meetings with Vladimir Putin and created a joint venture with a state-owned bank called Ethereum Russia. Which shows how painfully naive Vitalik is or that he has underlying geopolitical motives. ( &amp; 
15/ The reason Satoshi remained anoynomous and the Bitcoin community touts decentralization is to discourage central points of failure that can be leveraged to alter the protocol. Vitalik set a dangerous precedent that he had that power to change things with the DAO hack. (
16/ Fast forward to today, I began my crusade to expose the malicious and incompetent actors that were attacking Bitcoin to serve their interests. Namely  investors and employees.
17/ Turns out they and their company were heavily invested in ETH's success which creates an inherent conflict of interest when influencing the internal affairs of the Bitcoin community.  wAE0KHq.jpg &amp; ( &amp;  &amp; 
18/ Mind you during this forking debate, the Ethereum community was having major and maybe fatal setbacks with coming SEC ICO crackdown (eth's killer app) and the Parity Hack that conjured up the centralized bailout moral hazard precedent again. ( &amp;  &amp; 
19/ After succesfully repelling the 2X "attack." The BCash attack ramped up. I tirelessly attempted to inform the public about the illegitimacy of the Bitcoin fork by keying on the unethical and illegal behavior of the Bcash team. ( &amp;  &amp; 
20/ Vitalik, in what I assume was an attempt to divert attention from Ethereum problems and spite Bitcoin, proceeded to "congratulate" the BCH team for pumping their market cap pass ETH's. ( &amp; 
I have no idea why i spent all that time compiling this nonsense together.  This was a regrettable activity.

This is very true.  He is 87 years old and may not fully understand Bitcoin and therefore it would be wrong of him to recommend it.  He looks for explicit intrinsic value, which is not clear to someone like him.  
I think him and Bill Gates are more interested in helping as many people as possible rather than making money and competing with the Market Cap of Bitcoin.  Most people forget that Warren Buffet has also pledged to donate 99% of his net worth to charity.  
Whether his opinion on bitcoin is right or wrong, it is important to respect the 87 year old Billionaire giving away his net worth and life's work to helping other people.

Well, Bitcoin is just one of the tools/resources we can use.  
See, right now more than 40% of the world is unbanked.  There are several things Bitcoin can offer to help extreme poverty and hunger.  
In my limited understand of the world, things that are absolutely critical are: 
1) Clean running water (which can be generated via various filtration methods)  Running water is an essential thing for humans to survive
2) Electricity (which can be generated from the sun) - to power internet access/devices
3) Internet Access (which can be generated via satellites) - to connect internet connected devices   
 
4) Internet Connected devices (This is a challenge)
Now it may seem ridiculous to set extremely impoverish people up with internet connected devices, when they might not even be able to read or write.  The reason this is extremely important is because if they are in trouble, all they have to do is push a button to talk to someone, sort of like 911.  Using internet connected devices, you can triangulate their location. 
Lets say a child is in immediate danger, one simple push of a button and we can help them, send resources, send support, whatever they need.  
Where does Bitcoin fit in?  Well, now we will be able to send them money, free of any government interception.  Right now, much of the aid that is being sent to countries are being eaten by corruption and government officials.  Much of the money is not reaching the people that need it the most.  With bitcoin, we can now directly send it to the people that need it the most.  
A Farmer in Africa needs a microloan, we can do it now.  Somebody in Venezuela needs a stable way to store whatever little money they have, now they can.  Somebody is Indonesia needs money to pay for their sick child's health bill, we can send it to them.  Somebody working in the U.S. wants to send money home to poverty stricken relatives in Bangladesh, they can do that without a huge cut from Western Union.  
Obviously Bitcoin is not the only answer, but it is a major part of the solution.  If a transaction takes an hour to clear and has a higher transaction fee, that's OK, because it is 100x better than the current banking structure and payment methods in "third-world-countries" (not a fan of that term).  
I feel all of us (myself included) at tend to loose focus and take our eye off the ball, which is using bitcoin to help those who need help the most.  That, we can start doing today.   
 
tl;dr: Please read this and use bitcoin to help people

10.  In response to the economic crisis, and the limitations imposed by the government on their ability to make bank withdraws, there have been reports that many Greeks have begun using the digital currency Bitcoin.  Bitcoin also continues to grow in popularity with many Americans.  What, if any new regulations do you think should be imposed on Bitcoin and other digital currencies?  What, if anything, does Bitcoin's raising popularity say about the public's view of the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy? 
The federal banking agencies generally have limited authority over the operation of digital currency systems.  For example, the Federal Reserve's authority over digital currency products is limited to its authority over a supervised entity that issues or exchanges digital currency or clears or settles transactions related to digital currency.  Where a banking organization supervised by the Federal Reserve provides services to a business or individual that is an administrator or exchanger of a digital currency, the Federal Reserve seeks to ensure that the banking organization fully complies with all applicable regulations, such as the Business Software Alliance requirements, and is adequately addressing risks posed by this type of activity.  Other federal and state regulators may have different authority over digital currency products or participants specific to their mandates. 
The costs and benefits of developing new statutes or regulations related to digital currencies should be weighed carefully.  New regulation, such as the creation of special licenses for digital currency providers may work to strengthen the soundness of virtual currency schemes and increase public trust in the products, as some may refrain from investing in or using digital currencies due to a perceived legal uncertainty and/or lack of consumer protection.  On the other hand, new regulation would need to be flexible enough to address effectively the evolving nature of digital currency systems and technology while not stifling innovation. 
It is important to note that bitcoin and other digital currencies are only the latest of many innovations in payment systems.  Any new statute or regulation should consider digital currencies in the context of these other innovations to assess if digital currencies pose significantly different or greater risks that would warrant new statutes or regulations for a specific innovation in the payment system.  We do not interpret bitcoin's popularity as having a relationship with the public's view of the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy.

Then when you move to the right of this, you see cellphone and Internet. If you look at the cellphone curve, it is remarkable how quickly it's gotten to basically 90% penetration, right? So I think this is the speed part of innovation that is missed a lot. Just because stuff happens slower back some time ago, it doesn't mean it's going to continue that way. So this pace is what is really, I think, the thing to keep an eye out on.

*1MB can not support a sufficient number of direct users*
One argument that is made by those favoring small blocks is that Bitcoin doesn't need to be used as a transactional currency to be successful.  Much like gold, users could primarily acquire Bitcoins to use as a store of value (savings) and use other currencies for routine purchases.  If Bitcoin had a very low velocity (like bullion) the smaller transaction capacity could support more users.  There is nothing wrong with this idea in general (and it might even happen with larger block sizes) but those thinking this is a solution to the incredibly small transaction capacity imposed by the 1MB restriction probably fail to realize just how restrictive it is. 
I don't know how exactly how widely adopted Bitcoin will become or how quickly that adoption will occur.  I do know however that a permanent 1MB restriction ensures Bitcoin can not scale even if only used as a store of value (infrequent high value transactions) without using trusted third parties.  If the objective of such a system would be to provide a decentralized, portable, and liquid savings that **users have direct control over** without a third party acting as an intermediary then it is true there is no need for enough transaction capacity to allows dozens of transactions a day per user, but meaningful access would need to be dozens of transactions per year.  The best comparison would be a savings account.  Daily purchases are not paid from savings so the number of transactions involving the savings account is lower than a checking account or credit card but to be useful users will still need to make a number of transactions into and out of savings each year.  **If your savings account or brokerage account restricted you to only one deposit per quarter and one withdrawal per year I would imagine you would look for something better.**  The numbers below are for 2tps, for those who have a more optimistic view on future transaction sizes you could double these numbers but it would still provide a negligible number of supported users.
Maximum supported users based on transaction frequency.
Assumptions: 1MB block, 821 bytes per txn
Throughput:  2.03 tps, 64,000,000 transactions annually
Total # direct users  |    Transactions per user annually | Transaction Frequency
     &lt;8,000             |    8760       |      Once an hour
  178,000                |    365       |     Once a day
500,000                  |     128       |     A few (2.4) times a week
 1,200,000              |      52       |      Once a week
2,600,000               |     24     	|          Twice a month
 5,300,000              |      12	 |           Once a month
16,000,000              |      4 	   |            Once a quarter
 64,000,000               |     1          |     Once a year
 200,000,000              |    0.3        |     Less than once every few years
1,000,000,000           |     0.06       |     Less than once a decade
As you can see even with an average transaction frequency of just once a week or once a month the network can't support more than a token number of users.  **When someone advocates a permanent cap of 1MB what they are saying is I think Bitcoin will be great if it is never used by more than a couple million users making less than one transaction per month.**  Such a system will never flourish as a store of value as it is eclipsed by alternatives which are more inclusive.  To support even 100 million direct users making an average of one transaction every two weeks would require a throughput of 82 tps and an average block size of 20 to 40 Megabytes.
*1MB doesn't can't even keep up with existing non-retail payment networks.*
Going back to that coffee meme, the implied message is that 1MB is fine unless for everything else.  You know substantial stuff like paying your mortgage, business deals, major capital expenditures, or paying a supplier for inventory.  This just isn't the case though.  **Do you know anyone who pays for coffee with a bank wire?** The FedWire service (run by US federal reserve) processes ~150 million bank wires annually.   The FedWire service only operates in the US.  Internationally the largest clearinghouse is SWIFT and it processes more than 5 billion transfers annually.  The US ACH network is even larger with 19 billion transactions annually (excluding converted checks).  There are also about 2 billion international remittances annually (western union, moneygram, and other networks).  A 1MB restricted Bitcoin network couldn't even keep up with these transfer networks even if you forget about retail sales completely.  **The idea keeping the 1MB restriction, only keeps limits the utility of small payments is simply incorrect.**
Bitcoin block size to reach comparable network volume based on average txn size
| Network  |  txn volume  |    Average | transaction | size
| ----------- |--------------|------------|----------------|-----------------
| -   | annually (mil)  |  373 bytes |  560 bytes  | 833 bytes
FedWire   |    150      |         1.1 MB  |    1.7 MB   |   2.3 MB
Remittance |  2,000     |         14.2 MB  |   21.3 MB  |   31.7 MB
SWIFT     |  5,000         |     35.5 MB   |  53.3 MB   |  79.3 MB
ACH     |   19,000     |        134.8 MB  |  202.4 MB  |  301.0 MB
*On a transaction fee basis.*
Currently the cost of the network is roughly $300 million annually. The users of the network are collectively purchasing $300 mil worth of security each year.  If users paid $400 million the network would be more secure and if they paid $200 million it would be less secure. Today the majority of this cost is paid indirectly (or subsidized) through the creation of new coins but it is important to keep in mind the total unsubsidized security cost.  At 2 tps the network the unsubsidized cost per transaction would be about $5. At 100 tps it would be $0.05.  If Bitcoin was widely adopted, more users purchasing more coins should mean a higher exchange rate and thus the value of potential attacks also rises.  The future cost of the network will need to rise to ensure that attacks are not economical and non-economic attacks are prohibitively expense relative to the benefit for the attacker.   It may not rise linearly but it will need to rise.   If someday one Bitcoin is worth $10,000 and we are still only spending $300 million a year on security we probably are going to have a problem.  Now advocates of keeping the limit may argue that the majority of the network cost won't be paid by fees for many years but the reality is that with the limit on potential transactions there are only two other ways to balance the equation and that is much higher fees or much lower security.
The blockchain permanently restricted to 1MB is great if you are a major bank looking to co-opt the network for a next generation limited trust settlement network between major banks, financial service providers, and payment processors.   It is a horrible idea if you even want to keep open the possibility that individuals will be able to participate in that network without using a trusted third party as an intermediary.

I think screwing the lightbulb should be done clockwise over the course of a week.  After extensively testing, we should then implement a counterclockwise rotation turning 1 degree every hour.  This will insure there are no sparks involved.  We should also make sure we turn off the circuit for 2 hours prior to this and broadcast to everyone that the lights will be out for a certain period of time.

*There 7tps transaction capacity does not exist.*
There is a myth that without raising the limit the network could handle 7tps.  It can't.  The limit is 1MB per block the actual transaction capacity depends on the average transaction size and realistically that provides no more than 2 to 4 tps. To achieve 7 tps using one block of 1 MB every 600 seconds means that **the average transaction size must be 240 bytes** (1,000,000 bytes / 600 seconds / 7tps = 240 bytes).  If you have a Bitcoin wallet handy take a look at your last dozen transactions and if you don't have a wallet handy use a website to lookup the transactions in the most recent block.  In either case how many of the transactions were under 240 bytes? Not very many.  I am going to say the majority of your transactions were probably between 300 and 700 bytes.  
Can you form a 240 byte transaction?  Sure as long as you only have only a single input.  A transaction input is requires at least 147 bytes so an average of 240 bytes per transaction is not possible unless the average number of inputs is less than 2.  While some transactions may have one input on average they are going to have more.   The total number of inputs in the blockchain will roughly equal the the total number of outputs.  **As the number of blocks approaches infinity the ratio of inputs to outputs in a well functioning blockchain will approach 1:1.**
Since most outputs will eventually become inputs it makes more sense to look at block capacity using a balanced transactions as a template for transaction size.  A balanced transaction is one where the number of inputs equals the number of outputs.  Single input, single output exceptions are both rare and have limited use.   A 2 input, 2 output transaction using all compressed keys and P2PKH scripts is typical and weighs in at 373 bytes.  **At 373 bytes per transaction and 1MB per block the network will not exceed 4.4 tps..**  This is already 37% less than claimed but it is still unrealistic as it represents the smallest possible balanced transaction.
Most transactions are going to be larger than 373 bytes due to the use of uncompressed keys being used, more complex scripts, and a higher number of inputs being used.  Looking at the last million transactions in the blockchain I found the average txn size was 560 bytes.  **At 560 bytes per transaction and 1MB per block the network will not exceed 3.0 tps.**  This is very likely to decrease over time as transaction sizes creep higher as multisig and other more complex scripts are used more frequently. A good estimate for the network throughput when limited to 1MB blocks would be 2 to 4 tps depending on how optimistic (naive) you want to be.
Here is a direct comparison of the combined script size for some different types of scripts.  The scriptPubKey is encoded in a transaction output and the scriptSig is encoded in the transaction that "spends" that output.  Since outputs eventually become inputs in new transactions the combined size of the scriptPubKey and scriptSig represents the "roundtrip" script cost of a transaction.
      | P2PkH:  | 131 bytes per script round trip | (25 byte scriptPubKey +  106 byte scriptSig)
2-of-3  | P2SH:  | 253 bytes per script round trip | (22 byte scriptPubKey  +   231 byte scriptSig)  
3-of-5  | P2SH:  | 383 bytes per script round trip | (22 byte scriptPubKey  +   361 byte scriptSig) 
15-of-15| P2SH: | 1,481 bytes per script round trip | (22 byte scriptPubKey + 1,459 byte scriptSig) 
How many transactions are possible per megabyte of block capacity?  Below is a the maximum capacity of the network at various average transaction sizes.  Realistically 2 to 4 tps is all that is supported by a 1MB block and the lower end of that range is a far more likely.
Txn Size | Upper Bound  | Example  
373    |   4.4 tps    |   (2in, 2out, P2PkH) 
416    |   4.0 tps    |
520    |   3.3 tps    |   Average of the last 1,000,000 transactions
555    |   3.0 tps    |
616    |   2.7 tps    |  (2in, 2out, 2-of-3 P2SH)
833    |   2.0 tps   |

Permanently keeping the 1MB (anti-spam) restriction is a great idea ... if you are a bank.  Those favoring a permanent 1MB cap saying that Bitcoin can still be a financial backbone of sorts they don't know how right they are.  The problem isn't a limit in general but that 1MB is so low that under any meaningful adoption scenario it will push all individual users off the blockchain to rely on trusted third parties. 1MB is useless for end user direct access but is sufficient for a inter-"bank" settlement network.  If the cap is not raised to some higher limit that allows a larger number of users to maintain direct access, then the individual will be priced out of the blockchain.  If or when that happens Bitcoin becomes yet another network you have no direct (peer) access to, just like FedWire, SWIFT, and other private closed transfer networks. **There is no realistic scenario where a network capped permanently at 1MB can both have meaningful adoption and still maintain direct access to the blockchain by individuals.**  To be clear by direct access I mean an transacting on-chain without relying on an intermediary or trusted third party.


Satoshi Nakamoto - [Bitcoin Whitepaper](
*Can we stop talking about a cup of coffee please?*
You may have heard someone say something like "Every $5 starbucks coffee doesn't need to be on the blockchain so there is no need to raise the limit".   The implied message is that while the cost of permanently keeping the limit is that trivial purchases will be knocked off chain you will still have direct access to the blockchain for everything else.   This however is a strawman argument, the 1MB restriction puts such a chokehold on transaction capacity that even larger more meaningful transactions will eventually be knocked off as well.
Before we get to why a permanent 1MB cap kills any utility for the network I also want to point out that in my opinion having everything on a single blockchain including dust and sub penny transactions is just as extreme and will leads to practical issues with scalability.  Centralization and trusted third parties isn't always bad. &lt;gasp&gt;.  Context matters so try to read the rest before freaking out.  I don't really care if my morning coffee is paid for using a centralized service.  Have you ever given or received a gift card?   Can't get more centralized than that.  The reality is if I put $100 in Bitcoins in a third party managed wallet or in an account linked debit card the risk and scope of that centralization is limited.  Sidechains provide the potential for a trust free alternative but they still require individuals to have some transaction capacity on the primary chain.  The 1MB is insufficient to support any meaningful number of direct users even if transaction capacity requirements are reduced by moving some transactions off the primary chain.
It is critical that individuals retain the ability to use the blockchain directly.  If direct access becomes prohibitive then your options are to rely on a third party or exit the network altogether.  If that happens, then this experiment has been for nothing.  A huge amount of time and energy will have been spent on reinvented a settlement network between trusted peers.  In other words rebuilding an  interbank network.  What does it matter if the resource requirements of running a full node are modest if the economic cost to transact on that network is prohibitive for any individual?
Under any scenario where adoption leads to a significant number of users the transaction demand will greatly exceed the very restricted on chain capacity.  If the difference between user demand and finite block capacity is large the only realistic outcome is one where end user transactions are handled by third parties which are not trustless.  As the portion handled by these third parties (aggregators) grows they will make mutual agreements to facilitate cross entity transactions off chain.  An example of a cross entity transaction would be where the customer of Trusted Entity A wishes to pay the customer of Trusted Entity B.  If A &amp; B trust each other enough to extend a mutual line of credit then transactions between users of A &amp; B can occur off-chain and instantly by just having both entities update their internal ledgers.  This can occur for multiple transactions between A &amp; B but it will leads to an imbalance where one entity owes the other entity the net amount of the sum of all the individual transactions.  The entities would need to "settle up" periodically by transferring the accumulated balance with an on-chain transactions.  The important part is that one settlement between trusted peers can reconcile the results of thousands or even millions of individual end user transactions.  
If you think this scenario is impossible then you haven't considered just how tiny the current transaction capacity is.  It is a token amount which realistically is no more than two to four transactions per second.  WIn a settlement network the upper limit on the number of settlements required grows exponentially with the number of trusted peers.  Just two hundred trusted peers (crypto banks) with unsettled off chain transactions would require twenty thousand transactions to settle.  You no longer have meaningful direct access to the blockchain if it is economically prohibitive to pay for an on-chain transaction.  When you as an individual have been reduced to a position where you must outbid a bank to record in the blockchain then you are going to lose access.  Fees that are hundreds or thousands of times higher would still be a low cost of doing business for third parties.  Remember the third parties can collect fees on all those individual off-chain transactions to pay for the periodic settlements needed to reconcile with their trusted peers.
*Wait I don't get how off blockchain transactions could occur across entities*
Say someday Chase and HSBC both handle Bitcoin payments and thousands of customers of each bank request to make payments to customers of the other bank.  Chase and HSBC can swap information on these transactions and internally update their ledgers.  Thousands of transactions can occur instantly and without any need for individual records on the blockchain.  Both entities collect fees from their customers and it has negligible cost for both entities.  However the net amount of the thousands of transactions will result in one entity having a balanced owed to the other.  This is why settlement networks require some level of trust.   It requires trusted peers to extend mutual lines of credit.  The more they trust each other, the larger the lines of credit the less frequently they need to settle.  It is also why you will never be a peer on this network.  In advance both entities have signed agreements to extend each other a short term credit until the next settlement.  In the traditional banking world it would be no longer than the next business day but using the blockchain the same thing can be done with less capital and less risk by settling automatically every hour.  So if the sum of the amounts paid to HSBC customers by Chase Customers is 100,000 BTC and the sum of the amounts paid to Chase customers by HSBC customers is 30,000 BTC then the net result of these thousands of customer transactions is that Chase has a balanced owed to HSBC for 70,000 BTC.   In this example Chase and HSBC may have extended a line of credit to each other for 200,000 BTC for a period of not more than 4 hours.  Chase would make a single blockchain transaction to HSBC for 30,000 BTC to meet the terms of the agreement.  At this point the balance has been reconciled and the books of both entities are now balanced (BTC held equals BTC owed to customers).  As new transactions occurs a balance is owed one entity by the other and eventually it will be settled.
Now when demand for transactions exceeds what is possible in a block who do you think can pay more in fees?  You and your individual transaction or an third party whose who only needs to settle periodically and has been collecting fees for all the off chain transactions that make up that settlement.  The 1MB limit provides a token amount of capacity that when third parties are generating enough settlement transactions to fill the blocks (every block) and willing to pay whatever fee is necessary to ensure timely settlement you have effectively priced out of the network.

I am not quite sure I agree with everything you say here. (Very respectfully of course).  First, this idea was mainly to generate free publicity and awareness for Bitcoin.  One tweet could be potentially seen buy 100 new Bitcoin users.  We do not need to have every single transaction posted on facebook and twitter.  Developers could spend all the time in the world working on the coding and fixing things that I will probably never understand.  However, it will be getting people to use Bitcoin and initially try it out which will be the hard part.  Keep in mind as much as I would love for this to happen overnight, it probably won't.  
As more people start to use Bitcoin, more developers will come on board to help you guys.  
I did not see this being a very complex thing to program.  I just figured it could be a small code/button/frame that one of you genius programers could come up with.  At the end of a checkout, retailers could add this part on similar to how coinbase has done it.  Just a small "click here to tweet your purchase."

Seasons Greetings Bitcoiners!
Dec 25 2013
What a wild year 2013 has been!
At the time of last year’s holiday message, BTC was $13.30 and on Jan 10th, 2013 I was predicting $14.00. As of Christmas morning, BTC is holding steady around $675.
Now, before all of you say “Bitcoin is not all about the price”, relax. You are correct. This year I’ve been fortunate to have travelled all over the world evangelizing Bitcoin. From Austria to Las Vegas, Panama, California, London, Amsterdam, Morocco, Argentina and more meeting Bitcoin communities and building lifelong friendships. One thing I’ll always remember, said to me by long time friend and Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murk, “Bitcoin is the accumulation of the talent, hard work and dedication of the people who develop and maintain the protocol, build industries around the protocol, the merchants and consumers who use the Bitcoin protocol in their daily lives, and those who promote and protect the protocol. As more people become a part of the Bitcoin community, the value of the system increases.”.
Bitcoin is not simply a currency, or a payment system. Bitcoin is a technology that enables you and I to work together to make the world a better place. Bitcoin not only has the potential for global financial inclusion of the world’s poor, it also provides a stable money supply to people living in some of the world’s most corrupt and irresponsible governments.
We’ve had many ups and downs this year, literally. We saw the end of Silk Road and the dawn of government regulation. Some people thought we even found Satoshi. China emerged as a dominant player in the Bitcoin space. Senate hearings and various worldwide government bodies either embraced or tried to slow it down. I say good luck to that. To shut down Bitcoin you’d have to shut down the world’s electricity and the internet. Lastly, Canada and Australia joined the foundation’s initiative to bring together some of the most energetic Bitcoin communities in the world to fulfill our mission to protect, standardize and promote Bitcoin worldwide. Bitcoin is you, me, and all of our hard work. It’s our community and culture that we’ve all decided to make our own – and we will prevail.
Satoshi built Bitcoin for us so we that can carry the torch and continue to develop it for mainstream adoption. He gave us the land and now its up to us the build the roads, bridges, and tunnels. 2013 was the year of regulation. 2014 is the year of infrastructure so get ready to build! Circle’s $9 million and Coinbase’s $25 million investments are just the tip of the iceberg. An iceberg full of new ideas, talent and capital just waiting to be tapped by the right people to bring Bitcoin to the masses.
Looking forward to an even wilder year!
Happy holidays!

Bitcoin involves a little bit of getting used to.  After setting up a Coinbase account, we will be glad to guide you on how to make purchases on Amazon and Ebay.

 This isn't the answer...but it's something to work off of..
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:17:35
what does this have to do with anything
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:54:57
yeah..that's my problem

Right now the dollar supply by the Fed is determined by 2 seemingly arbitrary ways:  inflation and unemployment.  If you look at how both of these metrics are calculated it makes me wonder if I am crazy.  Inflation is calculated by a "basket of goods" and unemployment is calculated by surveying people.  This is just one of the many examples of currencies released by central banks around the world.  
This is why I think the volatility is coming from fiat.

this has got to be one of the most sexual bitcoin reply's i've ever read.  
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:00:27
anyone have any input..people ask me about this all the time..it makes sense in my head and I wanted to explain it on paper
open to comments/suggestions/changes
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:10:12
Right idea..wrong age (this is probably geared more towards elementary/middle schoolers)..but I think you get what i'm trying to say
We need something like a "Blippy" for bitcoin..where teens can buy things with bitcoins and it shows up as "so and so bought this with Bitcoin"..Like Social Transactions.
High Schoolers/College Kids are most interested in things like friends, independence, sex, we have to find a way that bitcoin can incorporate into one of those aspects.
I have also considered a possibility of targeting them with "make more money than your parents" tagline ..but i'm not too keen on that  
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:44:07
I can't stop staring at it...it looks so pretty
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:01:33
it's a good start.

Is this article what threw bitcoin up $200 today?  You have got to be kidding me.  Talk about overreaction.

At this rate, blockchain will reach 1000 by the end of the year!
(In terms of U.S. ranking that is)

Sorry, I meant to say: it seemed like it was easier to buy a cell phone (or sim card) than it was to buy tooth paste.  Terrible wording on my part.

India is so pathetically corrupt.  Every time I go there it makes me sick how money hungry/greedy politicians can be.  
The only way Bitcoin will work there is P2P.  The (really corrupt) government will see Bitcoin as a severe threat and fight Bitcoin vigorously.

Snapcoin- you send your friends bitcoin for 10 seconds..then it disappears 
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:31:41
yeah, this is legit

This was definately exciting:

it only goes to mid 2010..

yawwwwwwnn....Apple is pathetic

Isn't that something..it sure looks like a bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:49:59
I would also it prefer it be called "digital"..but it is a step in the right direction.  
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:18:18
yes this is true 
  
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:13:06
I was being sarcastic.  If Bitcoin jumped 50% in 2 months, it is automatically classified as a bubble.  Palantir- undervalued.

Where is the too the moon guy?
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:45:25
It is very hard to wrap my head around some of this.  While watching the business news, they didn't call this a "taper" rather, they called it a "tah" because it was such a small amount to them.  
$10 Billion/month is a small amount? That is more than the current USD equivalent market cap of Bitcoin.

The first Bitcouple!

You can sue them.  This is a violation of your privacy. 
For example replace "Coinbase" with "Adult Friend Finder" or something of the sort.  It is none of their damn business- it is personal information. 
Are they snooping through my bank statements too?  
Can we verify the authenticity of this letter?
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:43:00
wow. thanks- i didn't even notice that.  I'm amazed you caught that

apparently its legit

Even the street vendors in India have cell phones. I think people have more access to cellphones than toothpaste.

Oh yeah, he is a finance professor, he must be completely right about this.  He knows exactly what the price of Bitcoin is going to be next year.
Trust me, I'm a doctor.

And I do understand how this technology works.  I don't think you recognize that Isis is basically a rip off of other apps/wallets (without the need of a sim card).  I use and app called Key Chain for my loyalty cards and Google Wallet for my credit cards.  I am not dismissing the technology. I am dismissing the companies behind this stupid "consortium".  
Either way.  Sorry for offending you so much.  
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:54:41
All of your reasoning also ignores the fact that behind all of this is a consortium of Banks and Credit Card companies who have no desire to utilize Bitcoin, rather try to suppress it as much as possible.  Have any of them shown the slightest inclination to embrace it?  
Bitcoin has tons of catching up to do? How long has Bitcoin been around compared to the rest these companies/technologies/commodities?  Why did these companies not implement a better/new technology sooner?  Why do we still use the same credit card technology that we used in the 1980s?  
The underlying concept behind Isis is charging it users huge fees and exploiting them.  It is fundamentally wrong and is against what Bitcoin stands for.  As more and more people begin to adopt Bitcoin, they will begin to see how much they have been manipulated by the large banks (Like Wells Fargon) behind Isis.  This is simply a desperate attempt by these banks to keep up.   
And the part that makes me most mad, is that Apple took the Coinbase App off their Appstore (With no reasoning), but is pushing Isis right through.  
I will continue to mock any monopolistic corporation until they stop exploiting users with bogus fees.  I believe Bitcoin will open the eyes of consumers and show them how badly they have been treated.

Sorry, missed a word.  I meant to say "people ask me about volatility all the time."  
I thought this was the best way to explain to someone that volatility becomes a null issue when volume drastically increases.
