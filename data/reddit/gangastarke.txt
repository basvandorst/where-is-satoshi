Take from his comment the line to get more from this than where to put blame and where to put praise. Perhaps look at your feelings in all this, who is right doesnt matter, its office politics, this is more similar to how monkeys interact than REIT vs bitcoin or who is right and who is wrong.

Youre still thinking of currency as something people use to buy shit, not something that is fundamental to the the employer-employee and employee-government relationship. 
If all you do is buy stuff from other end-users, good for you. But will you buy laptops and smartphone using bitcoins? Do you think corporations would accept bitcoins instead of USD, and pay their employees in bitcoins and pay their taxes in bitcoins? Would the government keep a wallet where the taxes are collected and use that to fund the military? 
Yeah, sure.

Bittorrent the protocol has not been attacked, thepiratebay was attacked and other trackers and whatever, and not by the government.
The gov tries to ban drugs, but in a way encourages it through CIA, Cocain Importing Agency.
Bitcoin wont change anything in society, except enrich those few who are behind it all, and possibly the government when they find interest in it.

Why is that surprising? Bitcoin founder was left-wing in his early writings and certanly the idea is within anarchist tradition - non-govermental currency.

So that was my question, does anybody seriously believe corporations would pay their employees in bitcoins?
That the government would allow such a thing to happen? Because you know, its a direct hit on the structure of society, of the state as we know it. You too realize they will always require taxes and wish to keep their control and power that they have now. Bitcoin is a real threat to that.
Dont you think they will stop it? Errode the trust in the currency, outlaw it, huge fine for any company or person found using it, software attacks and whatever else they can come up with?

Ive met many left-wing anarchists (wait, really right-wing anarchists? is that even possible?) who love bitcoin, they are just not on this reddit.

So whats the difference with bitcoin compared to USD/the current currencies everywhere now again?

Im laughing at you for working at such a shitty place. And am sad as well.
Get out of there, you have more brains and skill than those fuckers, dont let yourself take such shit behavior. Where the fuck are your balls? This is not about bitcoin, this is about your damn life. Do you have a father in your life? Would he be proud of this story?
There are financial firms in the world that arent run by assholes you know. Firms who would appreciate your input and laugh at lotto ticket-guy. Guys who would tell you with reasoning when you are wrong, guys who would inquire more when they dont know instead of laughing at you. 
For fucks sake, man, get out of that shit firm right now. No "real" money in the world would buy a man to accept that kind of behaviour. Arent you worth more than that? Of decent behaviour, of respect as a damn human?
