If you felt 0 concern or interest, you wouldn't be posting at all.  I'd argue that someone who takes several photos, posts them publicly, and writes 60+ messages in response has attached quite extreme importance on the subject.

Actually you can't defend yourself and claim you don't give a fuck.  Simply posting the picture means you care what people think.
People who truly don't give a fuck don't need to go around telling people they don't give a fuck.  They don't care about people knowing they're an edgy badass like you.
You: " Internet strangers, look at my awesome tattoo"
Internet: "That's stupid"
You: "I don't care at all what people think, that's why I posted it on a public forum where people can comment on it."
Then you proceed to post over 60 comments in your own thread to further show us how little you care.

He said in open court that he doesn't believe what he says, that he's an entertainer playing a character.  He won't say under oath that he believes what he says, but will say outrageous bullshit to make money selling sham supplements.
Before someone says he was lying in court to keep his kids, remember that he claims he's cracking the world's biggest conspiracies.  He's willing to throw other kids under the bus to support his "crisis actor" bullshit, but won't tell the court what he claims to beleive on a daily basis is true, because his kids might get taken away(if you believed what you were saying wasn't batshit insane, why not admit you believe it?.  If there's some world conspiracy against him, why would him saying he believes what he says make a difference when it's in a courtroom?

I don't think a gun wouldn't have helped here.  The OP deleted the post, but the comments make it sound like the thieves got to the cash while they were distracted.
Even if he saw them fleeing and at fired his weapon at them,  he's gonna have a bad time.  He'll likely catch a manslaughter charge, and the police will suspect the worst, since he was carrying $30k in cash that he was likely laundering.  Why pay LBC rates if that money is legit?  Just deposit it and buy your coins on a market.

Transaction malealbility bug?
This is arguable, as all known malicious uses of this bug occurred after bitcoin core alerted people, and any reasonable exchange or service that used those txid's should have had a workaround, but they didn't.
The MT gox hack was almost certainly not entirely due to this bug, despite what Mark Karpeles says.  
Nonetheless there is evidence that coins were lost due to a bug in bitcoin.

It's a default feature of the cross platform JavaScript framework they used.  The framework has pointed out this possible vulnerability since 2016, so coinomi should have known.

You could say that about the S&amp;P 500, Treasury bonds, and practically every asset class, like real estate.
What stock hasn't recovered from lows?  Even Sears has a history of going up and down, and it is in an obvious death spiral.  You could say Sears stock has never had a drop in price that they didn't recover from in the long run, and be just as accurate as saying that about btc.  Maybe Sears is just in a down cycle like btc.(kidding, but it does illustrate my point)
The fact that something has gone down in price and recovered, means nothing without context.

Capital gains tax applies whether you intended to make investment gains or not.  The IRS has repeatedly stated crypto is considered property for tax purposes.
If you make a capital gain that the tax code applies to, your intent when purchasing the property doesn't make a difference.  If I buy antique furniture and I use it, and then sell it for more than I bought it for, that's a capital gain.
If you use foreign currency to make transactions in the US, the same tax treatment applies.  It doesn't matter if you didn't obtain Euros for investment purposes, if you trade them for something here, you have to pay tax on the difference if the exchange rate becomes more favorable than when you obtained the Euros.  If you could just claim, "I'm using it as a currency", every forex trader would do that, too.
Bottom line is that if sell/trade something for more than you bought/traded it for, you owe capital gains tax(with many exemptions and exceptions)
I believe the OP is more upset about the reporting requirements, where every transaction needs to be recorded with a basis and price at time of transaction.  To be tax compliant and use Bitcoin for all your purchases, you need to keep records for every single transaction, even just a cup of coffee.  That's a whole different discussion, but I wouldn't expect the government to change it's stance on this.

Here's probably an owner operator, based on the fact that he is going to install an expensive power inverter.  I assume fleet drivers need permission to add equipment to a rig, and who would want to pay for an inverter to be installed in someone else's truck?
Owner operators pay for their own fuel.  He's basically just running a miner off an inefficient diesel generator, and driving it around.  He'll also probably be using air conditioning to offset the heat generated by the miner, unless it's cold out(and heat is free in a liquid cooled vehicle, so he's not saving any fuel there).

You'd have to file a gift return, itemize the assets gifted, and the recipient inherits the basis, fair market value and length of time held.  So the recipient will eventually pay the same tax(or more) when they realize the gain.  Also it adds layers of additional reporting to the IRS.
I guess you could keep gifting coins around, but it'll be pretty transparent for anything of real value.  You obviously can't legally gift someone something and get anything in exchange.

I can't see any possible scenario short of armed revolution where non-governmental cryptocurrencies would supplant government issued money in any significant way.
Even if someone invents a cryptocurrency that can scale to a global size, that is fungible, decentralized and has reasonable fees, regulation will take over far before an entirely separate economic infrastructure will be built around it.
As soon as tax avoidance becomes a real issue, the government will regulate and squeeze all possible ways to trade crypto for fiat.  Of course they cannot physically ban all crypto trading, but once they close down all legal offramps, few legitimate businesses will accept or pay in cryptos, and there will be no path to a crypto economy without destroying essentially all world governments.
You can imagine any magic technology you want, but I think most people agree the cryptos that will resist government interference best are the coins focused on privacy and fungibility.  If private coins begin to supplant even a small portion of your home country's currency use(not as investments but used as currency), they'll be regulated to death, under the guise of money laundering/tax avoidance.  Other cryptos might survive under regulations, but those regulations will restrict them to uses the government can trace and tax. 
I always get slammed for this opinion, labeled as a nocoiner.  I think blockchain tech is cool, and I see there are some potentially important innovations being made. 
But to think that a crypto currency will supplant a governments own currency(without a massive civil war) is crazier than thinking the US would switch to using the Chinese Yuan by choice.
If we go the way of armed revolutions over cryptocurrencies(we won't), you won't have to worry about crypto home loans for a long time.  With a fractured government with one side using crypto and the other using fiat there will be enough economic warfare that both economies will suffer for years.

Sweden is war torn and third world (which isn't really a useful term as it relates to cold war spheres of influence, not the development of a Nation)?  If you mean third world as in underdeveloped, Sweden could possibly one of the worst examples.
The Human Development Index is a useful way to approximate the development of a country based on quality of life factors.  Google it to see the methodology.  Sweden consistently ranks in the top ten.
If Sweden is becoming a third world country, I'd like to see some evidence of that, as all hard data I see says it is one of the best places in the world to live.  But I'm not racist, maybe that's the difference.

So I need an anonymous PO Box, which requires ID.  So now I need a fake ID.  I need to drive to a distant public WIFI, and maintain a separate email address.  And if something goes wrong and Overstock screws my order up, I have no dispute resolution method.

If Overstock got their BTC payment data hacked they'd get a big list of BTC holders, with corresponding address, email , IP address, and BTC address.  This info could be leaked and used for spear phishing attacks, direct attacks on vulnerable user systems, physical attacks (let's say they find a customer address that corresponds to a big BTC wallet), etc.  If you lose money this way, you have no recourse.
Anyone who lost money through any of the various data breaches at Target, TJX, etc, got their money back.  It's a hassle, but at least they had the protection of law.

How do you compare units of gold to dollars?  Gold is infinitely divisible and measured by weight, so it's rarity can't be compared to dollars.  If I say one unit of gold is a microgram, it's not rare at all compared to dollars.  
Apples and oranges comparison.  One is measured in specific units and the other is measured in weight.

What does multisig protect you from, besides shared balances, like stopping an employee from stealing a businesses coins, or the specific instance where a third party arbitrator is going to exit scam?  
If Alice wants to sell Bob something, using a third party for dispute resolution, they both need to trust the third party not to collude with one of them.  
If Alice and Bob both trust Charlie, Charlie can just hold the funds in escrow, no multisig needed.  Multisig will keep Charlie from running away with the funds himself, but that's all it protects Alice and Bob against.  They still need to trust that he has a dispute resolution policy they both agree to, and that he'll implement that properly. Charlie can establish a reputation for being a reliable arbitrator, but dispute resolution isn't easy, so he's not going to do it for free.
Charlie could die or be arrested, so the transaction will need a time lock, else Bob could receive his goods and forget to sign, or maliciously refuse to sign.  
Now where do the funds go after the time lock?  If Charlie dies, gets arrested, has a heart attack, etc, the funds could end up with Alice, who never sent the goods to Bob, or they could go back to Bob after he's received his goods.
So I guess Charlie could hire some employees to help him make sure disputes still get resolved if he gets sick or needs a vacation.  
He should probably have a management structure to make sure that these employees don't act maliciously or resolve disputes incorrectly, which would damage Charlie's reputation.  Charlie's reputation is why people are willing to pay him to resolve disputes.
Also Charlie will have to register as a Money Services Business, since he's handling the transfer of value.  He'll need a lawyer and an accountant.  He'll probably want to keep some funds in reserve because if he arbitrates enough disputes, someone is going to sue him eventually.
Now Charlie is well known as a escrow agent, resolving disputes the best he can with imperfect information, well enough to keep him in business, but he'll never satisfy everyone.  He now has quite a bit of overhead, so he'll need to charge a more than nominal fee.
Congratulations, Charlie is now PayPal.
