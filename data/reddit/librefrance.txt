I agree. 
However, I have only 2,500€ invested in bitcoin anyway (i  bought at 7.400) so i'm not gonna be rich with bitcoin anyway. Even if it goes to 100K I 'll get like 20K.
So I think the big question next year will be about holding or immediate profit. If the bitcoin goes to 15K for ex it would be : do I sell it for roughly 2500€ profit or do I hold, knowing that the price always goes down at some point. 
Ppl who bought at 7500 then sold at 12K and then bought again are the boss.

Well, guess you never posted on r/France.

99% of the people here (my self included) seriously don't give a fuck about buying a car in bitcoins or to buy anything in bitcoins in 2025.
They just want to convert it in dollars and retire early. Because let's face it : the dollars will never go down. Sure there might be a crisis like in 1929 but honestly, i'm pretty convinced that in my lifetime i'll always use that green paper. 
But anyway  you should totally invest as of today. Period. It is a good price. Plus, you're not going to invest 10K i guess so you know, putting 1K on the table with a bitcoin variation of 300$ won't do much at the end of the day
BUT PLEASE, don't forget that the bitcoin is very risky and could go off tomorrow. So only invest what you can afford to lose. This is the most important advice. Don't put yourself or family in danger.

You'll never be millionaire with that, no.
I bought for 1000 euros yesterday and it is clearly net enough. I might transfer 1K more or to buy other coins. 
I think you need to put at least 5K nowadays, but it's risky since bitcoin is higly volatile. For example, at this moment, I have 1 038€ in my wallet so i "won" 38 euros but tomorrow I might be at 900 euros.

I work for banks (yes, traitor) and don't you think individuals that detain companies are not screened for sanction/embargos?

A crash probably. Then it will go up, eventually. But yes if you flood the markets with such an amount of BTC, it won't be good

So, how much you made? I'm talking about real money you got from bitcoin? Because i guess you had the money to buy a couple of BTC when it was $4 each. 
No one on earth can predict how the bitcoin is going to go. Nobody. You can analyse facts but you can't predict.

This is what i'm thinking about. However i just can spend 1000 euros max on this. Even though i don't mind about getting any profit right away, i'm not sure at this low level it's interesting. If the bitcoin goes up to  20K let's say, it's not with 1 000€ invested that i'll make more profit. I'd rather play russian roulette with it.
