Is this an open source project? how are you determining the positivity/negativity? I'm working on something similar.

Event though that's not a nice move but well i wont blame miners. they want more control and they wabt S2X to actually take over. S2X wont change the nature of bitcoin. im not consenered about this fork at all. even with a bit more miners control the coin still has the same value

What about I 5~8xd my BTC by doing these "Lucky plays"? and now I HODL 40%, trade 50% and spend 10%. Plus I guess we bring more value to Bitcoin when we trade/spend not just hodl or am I wrong?

Alts tanked so hard but i think they will rise again after the forks. My personal opinion!  I think there's too much hype right now. I never expected Bitcoin price to go over 6000 with less than 200B market cap. this is a red flag for me. there will be a huge dump in the upcoming three weeks. I have all my money in cheap alts cause when bitcon price drops a bit, I will double my money from alts which means =&gt; more BTC.

They are not small. in fact Coinbase is small comparing to some of them

Meanwhile, 90% of the pools are still signaling NYA

bitflayer is huge but its in Japan so we dont know about it that much. their exchange form about 7~9% of the bitcoin exchange volume

what I meant by this is that i never expected a 58% BTC dominance. people are too hyped and dumping their alts like crazy
