i'm making small purchases every so often. internet services mostly: namecheap, airvpn, vip accounts for a few different usenet indexing sites. i never spend very much, mostly just buying and hodling.

What difference does that make with a infinitely divisible currency where items and income would fractionally decrease as purchasing power increases and money is hoarded? The difference, it seems to me, is that normal individuals stand to benefit instead of the ones issuing the currency and the ones with the power to distribute it. People will spend to satisfy their immediate needs and future wants, nothing more. It seems a myth that we have to keep pumping money into the system to create the illusion of progress and it seems counter productive just to have people working for no reason other that to feed this illusion.

what is the difference between an inflationary economy where zeros are added to the denominations as more paper is printed and a deflationary economy where the where denominations decrease frationally as we find new economic opportunities and new capital are pumped into the system? why would circulation with bitcoin be a problem?

i've lived through hyper inflation, i'd much rather live under a stagnant japanese economy, thanks. and as for loans there will always be investments with a higher return than just leaving cash under the matress, defationary or not. thanks for indulging my curiosity, but i was looking for reasons why and how wealth would inequally be distributed in a deflationary economy, i'm having a hard time trappoing my head around how it could get any worse than our current situation.

i've been using circle since beta but before that i've used [canadianbitcoins.com]( on a few occasions when I first started buying. [Harborly]( is also good. Neither of these are proper exchanges but they will work if you're just looking to buy.
