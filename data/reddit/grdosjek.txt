As transactions are private, and only sender and receiver know about em (transfer nodes do not know original sender and receiver) we will never have statistics for whole network. Only statistics that we will have are what nodes report which is far from complete.

It is not "more efficient" as in, "let's cram more boxes into container of same size". It is just "lets create bigger container, but let's fill it so that important stuff is at front and is same size of older smaller container, and let's put extra data in back. So, larger container, more boxes.
Why is it done this way? When segwit guys look at container, they take in account whole thing, while non segwit guys look at container and take in account only first part. That's why there is no hard fork needed and that's why even those larger blocks are recognized as valid by old Bitcoin software (non segwit software).
Tho, there is "more efficient" way how "boxes" are created, and that is "batching". We do not put every item we send into it's own box. We put more items into same box, which is than put into container.
I hope this helps....

I said Pi just as an exaple that would show how cheap it can be. There are many stronger compact and cheap computers that you can run your own node on which would let you be your own banker and guardian on LN. 
Renting dedi server can be double edged sword...yes it's easy, but you do not have absolute control over it. For those that like to control their own sht, micro computers will always be better solution, for others, rented servers and for most, none, they will just use others nodes.

Miners can have full nodes so they can participate in decision. SPV users do not participate in network (they use others full nodes)  so they can not "vote". If they want, they can run their own full node and vote. Thing is, no one is more important than anyone else. If you want to participate, you run full node and "vote" by running certain version of software. Anyone can do it. There are no "sacred cows". It's as simple as that.

This is reddit. Its definition of gatekeepers. 
And, no, history should not change on a whim, even if its you that participate in creating it. 
No one should have right to change history, just like no one should be able to change history of Bitcoin blockchain. If guy wanted to add something he should have replyed or created new post, not change 6 years of history.
Imagine writers being able to go back and edit or delete books they wrote, change story from positive to negative. Imagine people being able to change what they said in the past like they never said it and influenced people around them....
No, what you write you should stand behind it, an if you change your mind you should not change original message, but add new one that reflects your change.
History should not be tempered with once confirmed, just like Bitcoin transactions...

On serious note, how is it possible that everyone is ok with this. Only because something is possible, we should not support it or accept it. Changing someones posts should not be ok no matter how computers work just like how it is not ok to change history boks. For example imagine history books with Nazies as good guys etc. Its crazy to me that someone can be cool with history tampering and not give a shit and be like : "thats how computers work....".

Ah so. SegWit compatible, but not native.
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:07:50
That's why you start with it, and end with it. You wrap it up so no one will "knock on your door" later on (figuratively). It saves many friendships and relationships, and still got people interested in BTC so that they eventually got in.
Without that last point, you are just "used car seller" and some if not most people will hold you responsible on first large price drop, and if they sell with a loss, they will hold you responsible for that loss too. They will hold you responsible even if they get hacked, or stolen from by exchange. You will be center of their anger.
If you wrap it up in caution (which in crypto is extremely needed), you are still promoting BTC and saving people from doing stupid mistakes.
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:41:12
It's 100% correct, but it represents worst case scenario. Small mesh network with too few connections. In reality you have 3-5 connections per node/person and more people so that when one cup empties and another one gets filled, they can "even out" or refill other way because of others people transactions.  
In addition, it does not show other very relevant changes that were introduced and are being introduced in future that will eventually allow  moving founds from one of your cups (that got filled) to another one (that got emptied).  
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:39:00
You are right, there ARE valid reasons. But as per data, there was no valid reasons in this case. It's clear that they are trying to pump mempool and boost fee's

I'm afraid that you absolutely do not understand what i am talking about. I am not talking about technical ability to change posts. IBM, PC, way how computers work, internet or Reddit have nothing to do with what i am talking about.
I am talking about people willing to look the other way on things just because "those things happen". Would you look the other way on any other serious change in history books? Like South won American Civil war, or person x supporting slavery when in fact they were against it etc.? Do you understand what i am talking about? I am talking about people, not technology, willing to look the other way because "it's just one post" and "it's way computers work" etc.
If mods / admins changed 6 years old post (as other users say, original poster deleted account long time ago), we should be up in arms, doing something against this! Would you like that they edit your post in year or two and make it so that you support something you do not support in reality? Let's say, terrorism? Would it be "just the way computers work" or would you have will to try and fight not technology that allows it, but people that use that technology to do it?
BTW, post is archived...it should not be possible to edit it anyway! We should be asking for answers no matter what. What happened, who edited post and how is it possible it was edited. We should be searching for answers about people involved, not technology.

Circle published it's own stable coin as far as i know, and one exchange said that they will create it's own stablecoin. Problem is, any of those can have same fate as Bitfinex, if banks really refuse to work with em. I am not as sceptical as post author, i think that they will open up new bank account somewhere in the world, but it will take time to transfer USD founds to new bank (we all know how long international transfers can last).

It's not that I need it. I know how to backup and save content i need for the future. That is not the point. Point is that post is part of history, it's quoted and linked too (linked too part is very important) and now it is edited after so much time. 
It doesn't matter if you think it's trash or not, that is your personal opinion that you have right to, but it IS one of more important posts out there, that made people talk about Bitcoin and made bigger service to Bitcoin than author originally planned to. 
Posts like that, that were linked so many times should probably be locked up for editing after certain amount of time.

Your parents are choosing not to participate! They are not discriminated against. Just like you are not discriminated against by system of democracy if you chose not to go out and vote on election day. Your choice makes it not discrimination. That's basic logic. When you are choosing not to participate in decision making you have to shut up and honor your own decision.
You could say that system discriminates against those extremely poor that did not chose to be extremely poor (for example those in Africa etc.), but that is done deal as system was designed with 1MB blocks and because of that requires certain hardware. Only way to include those extremely poor is to wait for them to catch up.

Of course not. I'd never say to anyone to buy BTC.
But if you are vocal about Bitcoin being good, being this and that, if you tell em why YOU bought it, they will think that you are doing it. Doesn't matte if you ever spoke directly of it or not.

You are 100% correct. In peoples minds it does make you accountable! And that is reason why you need to be very careful and put as many safeguards as you can. 
I would say: "I said not to invest and i warned you that even if you do, do not do it with more than you can lose twice". 
Instead of 1 "protection" i use 2...well second one i use twice. And in some cases even that is not enough as i witnessed in 2014. drop and in this last 2018. drop.

Not really. At least nothing that gets under any serious spotlight. It's just (at least for now) too much work for too little gain.
By the time it gets to the point that it will start to happen, it will become obsolete as LN will take over small value transactions (which is happening as we speek). LN = instant (as fast as internet lets you ofc) non reversable, cheap and secure payments.

Blockchain is small part of Bitcoin and it's just database without rest of the system. For storage purpouse, it's not really no1 database, there are many others that are way better at storing and managing data out there and i never heard of anyone saying: "Big players support MySQL" or something like that. Nothing to support. If you need it you use it, as simple as that.

You should never ever put Exchanges and Banks in same basket. This is not Exchange problem, this is Bank problem. Exchange is powerless just like any other Bank user is. Exchange is, in this case, just another user to the Bank. 
If it was Bitstamp locking account until some KYC bullshit than yes, we could talk about exchange problem, but this? Hell no. 
Even in case of KYC bullshit, it's not something they do for themselves, they HAVE to do it because of rules set by governments if they want to stay in business, as if they stopped, governments would shut them down. 
You are barking at the wrong tree. Close your browser and get out on the street and push this shit on governments because they created it, and only they can stop it.

What happens when fee's are 10k? Same as when fees get to $1,000,000 or $100,000,000.
Nothing happens.
Fee can not get to 10k or any other silly amount as BTC would change to get over it. With UASF ecosystem can control itself whether miners want it or not. They lost blocking power last summer.
And to correct myself, maybe fee will be $10k one day. But that will be a day when you wont be able to pay for a drink with $10k ie. dollar loosing value.

EXACTLY! I'm trying to explain this to people for more than 1 year! Dominance is virtual number that has no meaning. It's just last price\*number of coins in circ. Nothing more, nothing less! UPVOTE for you, more ppl need to see this comment!

Pen and paper or printer that you know all about (does it have cache / disks) and can operate in a way that you can with absolute certany be sure that cache is erased when you order it to do so.
First option is just simpler and safer.

There is no "staking". What you can get is fee if some payment goes trough you. OFC you need to be on route and your fee needs to be concurrent with other nodes.
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:22:50
Well if we'r palying "stupid" game, than "stupid" answer would be: Easy! You open up LN wallet and buy BTC from another LN user with no fee at all.
Smart answer would be: There will be no $500 fee as ecosystem will react to it. Noone can block further improvements like miners used because now UASF would just jump over em just like it did with SegWit.

Justo google "printers storing documents" and look at security warnings. This IS real.
While driving around the town my mobile phone picks dozens of wifi's generated by printers. It's security nightmare as most of em are not properly protected or not protected at all.

Good! LN needs to be poked and molested as hard as it gets. That's the only way to make it right long term.

It doesn't matter. Dominance is metric that has no real meaning. It's just "last trade" \* "number of mined coins". Nothing more, nothing less. Easy to manipulate and no real meaning whatsoever. You can spend $10k and rise CAP of some altcoin for like 1m or more and by that lower BTC dominance. It's just useless metric no one should ever look at.
It's as important as any other product of any other useless math equation. For exmaple: "number of day in a month" \* "last price". That "metric" is as useless as "dominance" one or "market cap" one.

" at its peak, RMB/BTC trade accounted for more than 90&amp; of trading volume "
That was because they had 0&amp; fee. Statistics, when taken out of context can be really misleading.

Probably depends on size of transaction. In current state of network, larger transactions do have problems with paths. Multi path payments will help with that a lot as you will be able to combine smaller channels to generate larger payment.

@_date: 2018-04-04 09:34:09
If there were no miners, someone (goverment) would be able to spin up thousands of nodes and change history / balances. Mining makes it so that if you want to change something you need to invest silly ammounts of energy and hardware to be able to do attack like that.
Basically miners = security.

Having 0 fee with boatload of other issues makes it not better alternative. 
It's promising but it still needs a LOT of work and some questions need to be answered and some features built and tested before we can even compare them.
I asked one simple question about Nano on their forum, suberddit and discord and i didn't get clear yes/no answer. Question was: "are historic nodes needed once pruning is implemented".
Thing is, if they are not needed that would make Nano open to attacks and if they ARE needed, than those nodes will be HUGE in term of storage and network bandwidth which will make Nano very very very centralized coin.
You see, there is no free lunch. If you want speed, you need to sacrifice something somewhere. Some coins will sacrifice storage, some bandwidth, some bit of both etc. 
Than, i was in discord when lead dev was asked about mitm attacks, and answer to them was: "node needs to verify data with 50%+1 network nodes". Imagine large network....now imagine how long would it take to do it.....
Anyway...nano is good idea that is far from being close to what it promises. BTC and LN are not.
Oh and, 0.0001$ fee (1 satoshi) and possible 0$ fee (as LN nodes can set 0 msatoshi fee) and 0$ fee all the time is really not that big of a deal when you consider other properties of the coins (network effect).
Still, i do have my eye on other coins, NANO included, but i wouldn't say they are even close to where BTC is. They are still way way behind.

Because we want Bitcoin to evolve and be better than it is now.

Any court. They would sue person behind web page for tricking em to buy wrong thing which in end resulted in financial loss. It has nothing to do with crypto it has to do with lying and theft of identity

Bigger blocks and faster block times are all, as it can be seen on countless other alts, quick and dirty fixes that do not work in long run. They work, but only as short term solutions with drawbacks later on in time.
For example, how many blocks do you have to wait until exchange accepts your payment in some other fast block coins? 10, 20, 50....as i trade alt's i have seen it all. Having to wait 20 mins or more on alt that produces block every minute etc.
Block speed is no magic wand. It has it's own problems (orphan blocks and stuff like that).
Block size, same deal with different set of problems. You can easy remove block limit size and puff, fee's are out of the window, just like that, but in return you get coin that once it starts to be used by masses will be so centralized that you'll be glad there are Banks around as only huge businesses will be able to store all the data.
Let's make an example:
1 MB vanilla blocks support 4 transactions per second
Visa has around 1600 transactions (avarage) per second (googled it up)
To support Visa number of transactions, block size should be 400 MB
Let's see how would blockchain look like as far as storage goes:
400 MB per block
2.4 GB per hour
57.6 GB per day
1.728 TB per month (30 day month)
20.736 TB per year
And that's if we never ever grow past Visa.....
Now, tell me, who would be able to have full node and be "your own bank" with that kind of blockchain?
Do you see the problem? Faster block and larger blocks are easy short term solutions that make your life tougher as time goes on and centralize network.
No....i do not support it and i do not think it's good. I don't think that picking easy way out is good in any situation.
I think that working with multipliers is way we need to scale. You see, SegWit is multiplier. For same block size, you get effective 2.4 MB blocks. Than transaction batching....again, for same block size, more transactions, shnorr signatures....same etc. Than after those small on chain, in protocol multipliers you have huge multiplier in form of LN that bumps it up to the moon (transactions per second, not price).
But, far in the future, when IoT devices will be using crypto, even LN might not be enough.
Than you bump up block size. With simple 2MB block in that far future, you don't get 8 transactions per second (double to vanilla 1mb block), you get 8 * segwit * batching * schnor * LN. for simple 1MB extra per block, you get millions per second, if not more!
That is hard way, but that is right way too.
That is my personal opinion about scaling. 
And BCH....i won't drill into that. Taking easy solutions, being very centralized as far as nodes and mining go, being very centralized as influence goes (Ver etc.), having community that supports takeover of another brand (we are real bitcoin etc.). All that is not something i cant support.
And thanks for your question...you just gave me idea for my next blog post....

I expected 4th one to be long read. Kinda disappointed truth be told. Thanks to Brekken for test. I feel much better about LN after this tests. It shows that LN is strong. It can not be destabilized as easy as many think, that simple BTC dominance can not make you "central hub" of network, that you have to fight with low fee's if you want traffic to go trough you (as expected), that dropping 50% of value from network won't grind it to a halt etc.

Market did not gain 11bil....not even close to it. Market cap i just "last price \* number of coins". It could have happen with 1mil of new capital, or even without any new capital (with dollars that were on exchanges since time when ppl started selling on ATH).
Anyway...forget about market cap...it's false virtual number that has no wight at all.If you want something bit useful (far from perfect) use buy support: [
