Don't wait for the dip to apply for an account, though, or you might miss it. I signed up with Gemini, sent a PDF of my current US passport, and six days later they're still saying they'll review my application "shortly".
Maybe wait to post the ad until you've got the backlog under control?

You've probably used a currency where [3/4 of all bills have traces of cocaine]( on them. Metaphorical blood washes off of gold more easily than it washes off of Bitcoin.

Shouldn't you have linked a [shiba inu puppy]( to really close the deal?

Absolutely. Some companies even let you watch the testing in progress, like  who assembled my desktop a few years ago.  I was glad to wait a week or so for burn-in after they finished assembling it to make sure it wouldn't have crib death when it arrived.  If it had taken months after assembly I'd have been annoyed, of course.

Poor analogy. Nothing disappeared into thin air. It was stolen or embezzled or lost through incompetence, but like stolen money it can still buy stuff for the wrong people. Bitcoins are stolen. Dollars are stolen. If Bitcoins are stolen from an exchange they aren't reimbursed by the taxpayers; if dollars are stolen from a bank they are.  If you don't like the risk, don't play.

Love it.  My grandson said to me when I made a remark about a favorite movie, "That was back in the 1900s, wasn't it Grandpa?"
Umm, yes, yes it was.

Ah, like Marlon Brando's butter-mediated transaction in Last Tango in Paris. Got it.

It's from a message that was apparently sent from an address that the real Satoshi Nakamoto used, and it is subscribed with his name, but it was not cryptographically signed with a known Satoshi key, so it's not considered proven to be the real guy. The tone seems right to me, though.

As someone said last week (or is it a longstanding meme?):
Pro tip: It's a mistake to put all your liquid net worth into bitcoin.
Because then you won't have any capital left to buy the dip.

I care. Many of the Forbes articles seem well-written and well-researched, and usually even timely. I confess that I even stop to read the "quote of the day" most of the time, and find at least half of them thought-provoking. I found this particular article interesting, because it points out that you can't use this app in its current state to transfer the bitcoin you buy out of the app: it's currently just for buy, hold and sell... not sending your bitcoin to your paper wallet.

Several exchanges have folded taking some or all of the deposits with them. Mt Gox was the biggest when it died. Some are hollowed out from inside, and some are hacked from outside. The only way to avoid all of that is to keep control of your private key and the associated bitcoin, and not leave it on account. Andreas Antonopoulos (Mastering Bitcoin) explained it: "The private key must remain secret at all times, because revealing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the bitcoins secured by that key." He also summarized it: "Not your keys? Not your Bitcoin."

Based on recent experience, I predict memes will be posted.

Let's see, the moon is 384k km away, so 500k is well past the moon. Maybe a bit longer than 3 years.

Trying to get my head around these blockchain use cases. For example, you say "people's medical records - with a blockchain those could be instantly accessed everywhere, highly private, and you would not need to convert information from one medical record system to another." Looking at it naively, you seem to be saying that everyone's medical record will be on the blockchain, and someone with appropriate credentials can read the specific one needed. That isn't likely what you mean, though: figuring about 1 billion medical records for the populations of the US and EU (including UK), that's N gigabytes of information, where N is the size of the encrypted medical record. Maybe you just need a hash for each one, with the data itself stored off-chain?  That may be feasible, but that's just for the initialization: I go in for a checkup and they take my blood pressure and other data. I now need an update, but my other record on the blockchain never goes away. I feel like I'm missing a central concept here.
As things currently stand, I understand "store of value" and "international remittances" but I'm fuzzy on how the blockchain will help distribute massive changing databases that require individually private access to the data without growing to the point where full nodes need a centralized disk farm to hold and process the blockchain.

No more a signal than someone posting that they've got 21 BTC and holding because they expect 20,000 rather than 5,000 "soon". Malign providence must be confused about whom to screw over in a transaction with an equal participant on each side of it.

I can't see using BTC being used instead of fiat for everyday purchases before the BTC/fiat ratio starts to level off. A month ago you might have had the choice of paying for your coffee with $1 or with 17 Ksatoshi. This morning you might have had the choice of paying for it with $1 or with 12 Ksatoshi. If your expectation is that it will cost less in satoshi again next month, then it makes sense to unload the fiat and hodl the BTC that will probably (for some value of "probably") buy you more coffee next month. Yes, BTC goes up and down, but lately it's all been up... at least on a quarterly scale.

The current price is up 38% from a month ago and 382% from six months ago. There is an argument that this is normal Bitcoin market behavior, and another argument that day-to-day price isn't a good measure of robustness. Day traders will get ulcers, and hodlers will hodl. Hopefully nobody's gambling with their rent money.

That building (the Elks' Lodge) is designated a Historic Site by the city of Fond du Lac, so the buyer must submit any changes to a historic building board, and must also agree to keep it in good repair according to the requirements of the board. I suggest researching it a bit before plunking down your BTC. Also, the current selling price appears to be $299,990, so you'd be paying a premium if you bought it in BTC... that's about 38.7 BTC at the current exchange rate.

Somebody was wondering whether we were going to see a suitable dip in the near future?
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:52:39
Yup. Worked for me after the submit too. [Here's]( a shorter URL if you had trouble with the one above.
My point was that the media and government just *love* to use pictures that fit their narrative. I'm surprised they haven't found dorkier pictures of Snowden.
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:21:12
No. They'd have used it if they could. Recall the picture they've used of [Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]( ever since he was awakened and arrested.

Wow!  Very grammar.  Dogecoins for hodler!
