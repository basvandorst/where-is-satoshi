You got at ARM on a property you expected to keep the same mortgage on for more than a couple of years?  C'mon man that's a rookie mistake.


You got an INTEREST ONLY mortgage?
C'mon dude recession or not, that was a bad plan.  I get it, you were 22.  We've all been young and dumb. 
The reason why I'm typing this all out is not to bag on you, though.  It's so other readers know that it's not the fact that real estate is a bad investment, it's how you went about it.

Does the user already have to have a bitcoin account to receive a tip?

Thank you.

Oh my God, what an awful article.  Also, what kind of person links to their reddit karma and profile in their "about me" section of their website?
I'd advise whoever runs that site to stick to the CS stuff, they are a pretty decent programmer.  But keep the political stuff to himself.  Sheesh.
