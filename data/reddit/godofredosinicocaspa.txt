Me, the Bitcoin user, promise to uphold the dignity,
honor and prestige of the protocol. I will carry
on as I leave the portals of my Alma Mater the
wisdom and values taught to me in order that I
will turn to be a worthy user of bitcoin.
I will defend the rights and privileges of the
bitcoin community.
So help us GOD.

I don't have a credit card. For me, and the people who live in my country would be great. I can just pay with my phone scanning the QR code the driver gives me. It might add an extra step but it will bring customers without credit cards.

1 day account. 1 post. Absolutly no proof.
Seems legit.
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:14:23
No, this sites theaustralian.com.au, which sites rumours.
There is no official statement. If there is, it should be in the PBOC website, not in The Australian.
FUD until PBOC confirms

How excatly are they going to ban a BTC transaction? 
That's the beauty of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-16 19:01:54
UBER is missing the incredible advantages of the payment network that Bitcoin offers. I bet they are going to catch up soon.

WHY ARE WE TRACKING A PRIVATE BITCOIN WALLET?
WHY DON'T WE JUST LET IT ALONE. IS PROBABLY SOME EARLY ADOPTER TRYING TO MOVE HIS COINS AND IN THIS SUB EVERYONE IS MAKING A FU$%^ PARTY ABOUT IT.
@_date: 2014-04-30 20:47:26
They didn't make fun of them. This guys might be smart but they weren't prepared for a interview like this. I can name a docens of practical uses for bitcoin AND the bitcoin protocol and when they got asked the basic most question about bitcoin (What are the benefits of bitcoin?) they almost panicked out. "You know".
The bloomberg reporters KNOW what the benefits of bitcoin are. They have been hearing about bitcoin for a long time with Matt Miller being our "Bitcoin Guy" in Bloomberg and many other interviews other of important people in the bitcoin industry.
They asked the right questions, and these guys couldn't deliver...at lest not 100%.
**I think.**
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:53:51
You're right! Didn't know that one.

Because the day a 51% attack happens, you'll get fucked with the price crash as well. So good luck with that one.
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:19:41
have you tried Westpac?

I would love a Nexus 6 :)
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:45:08
Good, now instead of changing these bitcoins after transaction, maybe they can start keeping a % in bitcoin, to support the network even more. Like Overstock.
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:30:03
I'm interested in this as well
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:28:02
This guy
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:46:42
not individuals, WALLETS!
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:22:07
Just a QR code? How are the people suppose to know that is a bitcoin QR code?
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:52:35
redditor for 1 hour...sound legit

I don't knowwhy he used a coin/logo with that color but, it's nice to see him interested. Maybe is a hint for his next video :)
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:04:27
This is big, i reckon
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:37:36

it's China, hundreds is not so impresive
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:25:13
ignorant here. I don't get it. Is it good time to invest in bitcoins? I am thinking in buying about $700 dollars but I see different opinions and predictions everywhere :/
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:24:10
I am interested in your predictions. What is your background, if I may ask
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:37:17
Localbitcoins.com is the easiest way. And they have a wallet service too
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:55:19
this fucking post is doing more damage to this sub than good
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:35:12
 no we don't, that will take the democratic side of bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-11-22 03:44:24
The fact that it won't work in Colombia...initially. But i'm just being silly.

yeah, him and his "assistant" have a very particular way of talking about economics. I thought he was a pretentious dick but I have been listening to him for several months and the guy knows what he is talking about. He predicted the 2011 financial crisis and is an avid bitcoin supporter  
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:07:46
Give it time for f*&amp;% sake!!!
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:58:03
no body believes you
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:16:23
This is excellent. It tells us what everyone in here wanted to know, the perception of Bitcoins in China. I would also like to point out that [769]( is a new chinese exchange that started operating TODAY!

He "thinks" apple will create it's own payment system
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:20:17
wow, this is great!
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:24:33
I like it but, How is this different from [SnapCard](
I personally find SnapCard easier, but hey! two methods of payment are better than one!
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:09:43
i would like know more about this. Where can i get started?
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:25:24
Where are you located?
Who are/is the entrepreneur?
What kind of security you provide?
How do we know this is not a scam?
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:26:19
this is a TERRIBLE report. Just TERRIBLE. This journalist is badly misinformed and is doing more damage than good
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:54:35
in NYC? that will be a hit
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:25:24
Buddy, i don't want to be rude but it will be very help full if you provide us with some kind of proof.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:46:01
no, but you can still use methods like BitPay to process the payment. You can't expect to see bitcoin growing with governments around the world just looking at it doing nothing. it could've been worse. But what they basically did, was to green light and approve the work of the exchanges and platforms to process payments with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:26:16
is this available all around the world or only in the US?
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:29:45
hmmmmmmmmm, this is interesting, i don't know how to react to it...so i'm gonna shut up

@_date: 2013-12-13 01:07:20
do you have proof? a link or something? is this widely known and i am uninformed?
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:17:35
keep up with the good work brother
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:16:10
Will you guys cover Colombia?
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:55:46
again, this people are terribly misinformed
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:05:03
good one. Most people is still waiting for a big drop, i don't think is happening.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:07:04
what it says is that "Financial Institutions" can't. This is a completely rational approach. It prevents them from speculating with the price. Everybody can buy bitcoins and trade with them, but is a risk that each individual has to take.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:04:58
