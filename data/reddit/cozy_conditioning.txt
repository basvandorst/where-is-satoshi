That's a good point, but the other part of value stability is supply and demand. In theory, governments can shrink or grow the money supply to maintain a balance. This is fundamentally impossible with bitcoin. Even precious metals are advantageous in this regard (more humans means more demand but ALSO more miners increasing supply). The impact of bitcoin's stagnant supply on its value stability in the future is hard to predict. If it is small we may see it used as a currency. If not, well, bitcoin will still be an awesome payment system, but not a currency.

@_date: 2014-11-18 23:08:55
It is possible that with enough investment bitcoin transactions could become as fast, convenient and reliable as cash. That is yet to be seen.
But as a currency, Bitcoin's problem is not monetary inflation; it's price volatility. When managed well, central banks increase or decrease the monetary supply to limit price volatility. Bitcoin has no such mechanism. I expect bitcoin to be unsuitable for use as a currency, now and forever. Its use as transfer system is likely to increase, however. I don't care if my asset fluctuate in value when I'm only using it for a few minutes/hours to transfer wealth. But currencies need to be stable over the course of years, and bitcoin never will be such a thing.

When currencies collapse other existing currencies are adopted to replace them. In recent history this almost always means adopting the US dollar because the dollar is extremely well managed; since the 1970s there have been no huge swings in the value of the USD.
There is **no way** bitcoin would replace collapsed currencies in the next 10 years. Bitcoin is *far* too volatile and *far* too slow for cash transactions. If the price of bitcoin stabilizes and a clear leader in bitcoin scrip emerges, it just might catch on in some small country following a currency collapse. But such a scenario would be laughable today.

Right. Unless you pass a law stating that you can only use bitcoin and not other cryptocoines, they are substitutional.

I did make money mining until ASICs really caught on, but I didn't let the money ride. I invest, not gamble. Investments have yields.
Fortunately I'm rich regardless... the old fashion way, by buying stocks and bonds, and reinvesting the yield.
But yes, bitcoin will zigzag toward zero just like all the others because there's nothing special about any given blockchain. It's only a matter of which exchanges accept them, and there's nothing stopping exchanges from accepting new coins. Unlimited supply means, in the long run, a value of 0. It is the most fundamental law of economics.
@_date: 2019-11-08 03:44:34
I've been involved since 2011. I can assure you not everyone before you got rich from crypto.
Long term, though, all crypto tokens are substitutional goods, and anyone can create a new token out of thin air at any time, so we have, fundamentally, an infinite supply.
Crypto tokens are here to stay, but any given token will lose value over time.

No major nation would want more than one currency, nor would any such nation want a currency they cannot influence using monetary policy. So bitcoin will never be a legal currency.
You can lobby for tax code exemptions for trading it. Home price appreciation and retirement account appreciation have such exemptions. But those are politically popular because everyone wants a home and a retirement fund.

People who care enough about currency risk to act have already acted. Bitcoin doesn't bring anything novel to the table as an inflation hedge. It is ridiculously easy to buy a fund of international bonds or commodities already. You can do it from your phone using any major bank - for under $10 in commission.

This is such an ignorant post. There is **NO** reason to think the buying power of bitcoin will be stable. Of all of the investment options out there, bitcoin is probably the very least stable of all.
Bitcoin changes nothing when it comes to the value of labor. Labor rates are set by supply and demand, nothing else. Bitcoin doesn't change that.
Inflation-protected savings vehicles have always existed. Bitcoin doesn't change that.
Bitcoin is amazing and novel as a payment system. But it doesn't do anything new for workers and savers.

They give it to banks. Banks either lend it on to businesses (which is good for the economy) or lend it to the Treasury (which is also good for the economy because it reduces taxes).
So it's supply-side economics, but not necessarily clear-cut graft. I would certainly rather see the government's monetary power used to stimulate consumers. Nothing drives private business investment like consumer spending...
@_date: 2015-08-15 04:37:36
Assets with large market caps can still fluctuate wildly, but a larger market cap can't hurt. Looking at history, it's fair to conclude that since nobody is managing the supply of BTC to promote price stability, the best analog for long term volatility would be precious metals. They are less volatile than bitcon today, but nowhere near stable as described by OP. And even precious metals have some supply-stabilizing mechanism (there is more mining and reclamation when prices are high). Bitcoin lacks even this.
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:11:01

I hope you didn't pay much for that crystal ball. There have been many currency collapses and inflationary periods around the world. There will be more. As a prediction, that's like saying "I believe it will rain someday." OK. Obviously. But everybody who cares already owns an umbrella.

The money supply needs to grow with the economy. This is an economic fact - the alternative is crippling deflation and financial catastrophe.
Now, gold mining did increase the money supply, and that was fast enough for some ancient economies, but it simply could not keep up with the industrial revolution. Even when the US claimed to be on the gold standard it was not - more "gold-backed" dollars were being printed every day without corresponding gold being acquired.
Scarce commodities will always be traded and bartered with, but the world is never going back to deflationary currency. This is why bitcoin is really a novel payment system rather than a currency proper.
