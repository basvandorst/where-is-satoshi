I already had MSI Afterburner installed, and I just remembered so I did it through there. Thanks for the suggestion though!

So lets say I have my wallet.dat file on an external and my hdd. If one of them gets hacked what would I do?

Ah ok. So I should go make an account with mtgox?

Ah, right now they're getting 425m/hash between the 2 of them, so they're both at around 215. Took them a while to get warmed up maybe?
Also, I used -v -w 128 for the extra flags like the guide told me to do. Do you know what these actually do though?
I don't really want to tamper with the clock settings because I don't usually do that for any of my gear. Thanks for the advice though!

So I don't have an address right now, where are my BTC stored? 
Also, I live in CA, USA, I heard MtGox is EU only? Is that true?

Got it, thanks!

Thanks for the info! I think i'll stick with MtGox and just save up until I can get enough to deposit into my bank account.

I see, thanks for clearing this up!

I lowered my memory down to 600 (lowest Afterburner will go) and raised my core up to 960. The cards are at around 69/74 load temps. Is that ok?

How do I see the temperatures of my GPUs? 
This is my main computer, I use it for everything else too, like work and gaming and internet, etc. 
Also, how do I lower memory speeds? Can I do it through Catalyst Control Center? I'm kind of a noob at OCing.
