Hey guys, I am from ISG3D and I just wanted to let you know that we did not write the article. We are aware this is not the 1st 3D printing company to accept Bitcoin, but we are very excited to work with other cryptocurrencies as well!

Thanks for the article!
We are a young startup company trying to work its way up!

Very interesting, we are a 3D printing startup in Canada, we have recently made a Skype Hangout with a kindergarten classroom in Boise, Idaho. The teacher of this classroom is a very nice lady, she has a 3D printer in her classroom and I was thinking maybe you guys should talk for future hangouts.
One of the questions we had to answer was: "What is Bitcoin?". The teacher is very interested by both 3d printing and Bitcoin. You can watch the question at the 5:20 mark: 
This is a cool project, keep us updated!

For the moment we have the 3D Printed Phone Case available for Bitcoin, Vericoin, Bitshares, Blackcoin, Dogecoin, Ripple and Peercoin!
More to come at ISG3D.com, and we accept Bitcoin of course.

Thanks! We are a new 3D printing company, ISG3D. We were contacted by the kindergarten teacher on Twitter, she is showing our 3D printing live stream to her students everyday: 
It would be a pleasure to take parts in the hangout. I could also get you in touch with the teacher, Alison Ruoff, she's doing extraordinary work to teach 5-6 years children 3D modeling and 3D printing. 
You can contact me ISG3DPrinting for more info.
