Site looks great! Down with the exploitative banks and payment processors. They make life particularly difficult for those in the adult entertainment industry.

A noble cause indeed!

I'd be curious to hear about those reasons. The biggest concern I've encountered about is volatility which can be greatly mitigated when the transaction time is compressed. 
And, of course, there are many advantages!

It sure would be beneficial for camgirls. And hey, masturbation is healthy, right? ;)

Interact with them tonight!

Camalot is quite small at the moment. That's what keeps us hungry.

Thanks for the shout out!

Streamium had a baby. Its name is Camalot. Broadcasters still keep 100%. 
There is a show tonight 7PM PST with pornstar Starri Knight.

Astute assessment. That may have happened. This Friday there is another one!

I've seen several shows on Streamium. Right now a problem is that there is no central directory for cam models. Although there is a subreddit where you can post streams.
I've also heard that the developers are going to build a directory.
Ashlie  will be putting on a show tonight at 10pm EST.  The link will be on the subreddit above and on her twitter handle.
