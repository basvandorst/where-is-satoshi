An altcoin can have the identical "stock to flow ratio" by being created via fork. An altcoin can even have zero inflation by being an air drop with no new coins being minted ever. And a third possibility is a coin with negative inflation where some coins are destroyed everytime they are used thus creating a higher stock to flow ratio than bitcoin.
