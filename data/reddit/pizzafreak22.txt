Crypto is going to lift many people stuck in impoverished nations up. Its only the beginning.

I block em. Why have friends who hope you crash and burn?

This is ignorant, there are more ways to make money on bitcoin than buying and hodling.

This is simply not true. You can buy fractions of a bitcoin, and they do.

I lived in west Africa for many years, and i know very well the issues the people face. Crpyto will help lift many good people out of poverty. Access to the web has already lifted many up. Somehow the world always seems to sweep the African continent under a rug, but they underestimate the people. Many African nations have seen tremendous change with improved education systems in the last 50 years. I attended a hackers club in Ghana, and was pleased to meet so many brilliant minds. Jobs are scarce, and the people are very hard working. Schools hold students to a very high standard similar to Japan. University acceptance is very competitive, and large African cities are seeing high end shopping malls, concert halls, and skyscrapers rise from the ground. Africa as a whole is highly underestimated, and still has vast untapped resources. We are just beginning to see spreading effects of globalization from the invention of the internet. I think about my African friend who died from an easily preventable disease, and all the other sick people who needlessly suffer. To you, perhaps $100 is pocket change, but to them it could save their life. The whole topic of crypto helping those out of poverty strikes an emotional chord with me. Whether this article is accurate or not it doesn't matter to me. Crypto will help many deserving people, and I'm proud to support it.
