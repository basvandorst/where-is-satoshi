BlueWallet has horrible UX, avoid

Very cool. Will this be soft-forked into the protocol and when can we expect it to happen?
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:31:08
Absolutely. Media will be all over this tomorrow.

If anything it’s going to put *less* faith in the US dollar

Definitely. He’s not stupid, if he’s saying this on TV he’s already loaded up.

This is literally blowing my mind. Imagine if you could show someone this photo in 2014. They would be shocked beyond belief.

Because you used a bogus exchange called CEXBRO...doesn’t matter if it’s part of cex.io or not...it has no reputation and from the sound of your post it had numerous technical issues. Why would you continue to use it if it had so many problems??
Lesson learned: stick to the largest, most reputable exchanges

This needs way more attention. Great work and keep it up!

Been saying it for years, Bitcoin is the ultimate honey badger.

People should just avoid electrum altogether, way too much risk and phishing

This guy is an absolute fool

Yep, essentially the circulating supply decreases very slightly, but this has incremental, long-term effects.

I’d also like to know this

If we break $10,000 the media is going to go insane.
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:41:38
Nah but maybe within a week or two
@_date: 2019-06-08 20:42:53
Great stuff. This is one reason why Bitcoin is king crypto...it’s constantly being tried and tested for utmost security.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:48:32
is suuper salty right now
@_date: 2019-06-08 20:44:51
Not at all, the mind has a natural tendency towards round numbers. Notice how when you ask someone to guess a number from 1-100, they will almost always give you a *whole* number, not one with a decimal
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:04:27
Let’s go baby!
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:50:05
Oh come on. This is conspiracy theory BS right here
