Does blockchain display private addresses? How does it recgonise to take from a certain address 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:49:19
hold until you need to buy something with it - in that case, see if they take bitcoin

So from what I understand there is only so much bitcoin. (21 mil) &amp; currently there is 16.53 mil in circulation. [block chain total]( What happens after all the bitcoin is mined? From my understanding the only reason you can trade is because someone else's computer is doing the check. &amp; they are getting paid in "brand new" bitcoin. If there is no more bitcoin to be mined, what will the miners be paid in?

hm maybe I need to research what blockchain is.

would it be silly to move my bitcoin from bread wallet to a windows pc wallet then? or could I recover my bread wallet on my pc to have a back up?

Can I put a software wallet on a usb drive &amp; make it a "hardware wallet" ? what software wallets do you guys use?

what variables actually influence the price of bitcoin? From my understanding when I 'sell' bitcoin its not like that bitcoin actually goes away. There is an ever increasing amount of bitcoin so shouldn't the price kind of be directly tied to the volume? I am having a hard time in general figuring out why the price would change at all.

how is bitcoin decentralized if all bitcoin is stored at blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:43:11
no id needed if you use a credit card
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:43:03
who pays for blockchain? the ledger has to be stored on some sort of hard drive right?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:11:43
does that mean bitcoin is always online? lets say my phone gets crushed under a car &amp; I loose my breadwallet. That wallet is offline now. how would I be able to recover a wallet if it wasnt partly online?
(thanks for answering stupid hypothetical questions)
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:48:27
nah, sometimes up because the word spreads. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:10:44
so right now the demand is so high and supply is so low that bitcoin is at one ifs highest ever (compared to a year ago) Could an exchange run out of bitcoin to sell ?

You have a public address which can be used over and over (which can only receive money) but you also can generate a public address that requests a specific amount &amp; lasts for a designated amount of time. Both of these address are completely safe (in terms of giving them to people) they can not take money with a public address.

it has already left my wallet - its in the abyss 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:48:46
I have no Idea what it is actually. I saw it was up 60% this morning. Also I think it needs two addresses to send or something
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:42:14
how would they better then a usb drive (other then the screen) - i think nano s ledger is open source and gives me the code on it? - so i could essentially have one on a usb drive right?

when i recovered my wallet on copay it doesnt show any money. But when i go to it in breadwallet it is there. can I not have one wallet in two different spots?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:34:43
There has to be some kind of middle man. I find it very hard to believe that every transaction has an equal but opposite transaction at that same moment. For the most part I can agree there could be a balance (probably most likely when there is no change in price) but the people "cashing out" most likely there bitcoin goes to an exchange wallet. And then when someone buys, then the exchange take bitcoin out  of their wallet &amp; sell you you... is it seriously not like that? Because if not, for some reason if i Wanted to buy a weird number of bitcoin , lets say $12,345.78 &amp; someone right then and there wasn't trying to sell that amount then i wouldn't be able to buy it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:05:17
sorry, not really. in this stage its just easier to think that. there is a limit of 21 mil. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:55:01
that makes sense, thankyou
