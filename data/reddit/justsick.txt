Since the downtrend started I have definitely noticed a decline in my obsession levels. 
I still check here whenever I have a free minute, but a few months ago when the price was going up every day I was just constantly reading anything and everything Bitcoin related. I even stopped gaming because it was taking up too much time (though in the long run that's probably a good thing). 
At that time I also noticed that I was getting a 'high' just from checking the price and seeing it rise. Even at work, I was constantly pulling out my phone to refresh my ticker. Love me some dopamine. 
The next rally might take us past our all time high, but I don't know if I'll truly lose myself like that again. Maybe that depends on how much it goes up. Either way, can't wait to see how this plays out over the next few months!

Maybe blockchain.info?

Nothing to do with practicality? I think Bitcoin does have real world applications, the largest of which might be serving as an alternative to the traditional banking system. If you don't see value in that, then I guess I understand why you'd think Bitcoin is worthless.
You mentioned gold, which is another alternative to traditional banking. Plenty of people hold gold not to gain wealth, but to preserve it.

Looks like 1F3yPwxLJQsNhwvtC8ZFp5aytvZcVh3tNY (second addr) sent to 17SQJL9PAAUFs6trsSUJToCz8Ffo8MvNSw (destination) successfully, while the first and third addresses sent to 12ei4M3H8mc9SGzAtgUDRRkBDL3X25x2Ju and 16BpJWopQmwmpq4fNiDf6TPZm7DAhiK1mZ .
Check blockchain.info to see if you control the last two addresses. All tx have 6 confirmations.

So you do think it has uses, but the price has nothing to do with it being useful? We could at least meet in the middle and say that Bitcoin might be overpriced, but you can't say it has uses yet has no value.




Not sure what you mean here. Why can gold be associated with wealth/value, while bitcoin cannot?

Price is a reflection of supply and demand. Sure, it's nice that the value of my BTC is going up, but it's much more interesting to me to watch the demand for Bitcoin grow.

That's some expensive toilet paper.

If you lose your device and you don't have a backup, you lose your private keys, meaning you lose the ability to transfer your BTC.
The important factor here is control of private keys. If you have a desktop client, you alone should have control over the private keys, meaning that you are the only person who can spend your BTC.
Using a service like Coinbase is like using a bank. You send Bitcoin to an address controlled by Coinbase, and in return they promise to hold your Bitcoin for you. The problem here is that Coinbase controls the private keys, and thus, they control the Bitcoin. While it is extremely unlikely that a company like Coinbase could simply disappear, if they were to go offline for some reason one day you would lose access to your BTC with no chance of recovery, because you don't have any of the private keys. 
Coinbase doesn't have to disappear either, they can simply decide to close your account because they don't like how you are spending your BTC, or lock you out until you verify the sources of your funds.
Sure, it might be more convenient to use Coinbase, but realize you are becoming reliant on them in exchange.
