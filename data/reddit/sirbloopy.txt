Anyone aware if they’ve been known to be sketchy? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:59:40
I think that was my initial problem. However, it never got sorted and I impulsively deleted my account. Now I’m worried I lost my money :/ I emailed them again however 
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:13:03
That's what I thought. I'll keep trying thanks

You’re 100% right about cancelling the account. I was impulsive and got angry. Definitely not the smartest move I could’ve made.  
And true that, I sent another email today and am gonna wait a bit and see what happens. Hopefully they’ll get back to me about it

I deleted the account roughly two weeks after they never got back to me. It seemed sketchy from the start

What would the benefits of those sites be? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:12:47
I see. Thanks for your reply. I’m gonna wait it out and watch carefully

I also heard Electrum is a good wallet for desktop. Do you have any preference between the two?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:41:25
Yeah I just double checked. That’s unfortunate. Not sure about the best option 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:29:19
Exactly. I’m still a baby when it comes to this, so small is key for me. Also, it’s to convince my pops as well 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:59:45
Either way, I’m in no rush to have it immediately. Thanks for the suggestions 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:37:37
Ok cool. I’ll with Blockchain and Electrum to have some options. I appreciate the recommendations 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:43:53
I see. I just checked another place in Tokyo and it was 10%. Strange. Which of those three would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:52:51
Don’t really mind. I’d prefer cheaper and safer than faster. Thanks man. I’m making an account now

So after buying a certain amount of bitcoin, transfer it directly into my wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:47:28
I made a wallet through Blockchain. Have you heard good things about them?

Can I use GDAX while in Japan?
