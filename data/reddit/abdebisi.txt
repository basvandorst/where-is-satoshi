He has a point tho. I will remember 2017 as year when new people got in cryptos and after 3 months they will talk how they know and understand blockchaim and how they are early adopters and so on. Im talking from own experience. Was trying to explain this guy about bitcoin when i got my first asic miner in 2013...he didnt care to listen. His words were "why d fuck would you spend 500$ on this thing". Then few years later, i belive it was 2015 this same guy buys used GPU from some dude and i was there with him. And this dude brags that he have 4 of a kind and he is selling them cheap. And i turn to my friend and trying to explain him not to buy it, he was mining with them and he didnt listen because he didnt understand any of it. Well he had only problems with that graphic card untill i found him original bios for it (dude didnt even reflash original bios before selling it). And now in 2017 he hears about bitcoin all over the media and he buys some and now he brags to our other friends who are not in it yet how he is early adopter. But im not mad at all, people like this help to raise price in 2017 and will continue to do so in 2018.

I like bitcoin because it is effectively ruining roger ver's life.

Also you should know that most if not all traders that work with TA are in this only for the money. They don't care about what they trade, they don't belive in bitcoin or any other coin, they don't care about adoption and so on... they will trade whatever they can.
