1. Bitcoin is only volatile to USD. Many countries have currencies that are more volatile than Bitcoin currently. And many stocks and other assets are more volatile than bitcoin as well. Bitcoin is more of an asset like gold than a currency at the moment. And lastly, as adoption goes up volatility will go down. Bitcoin is a sound store of long term value so as long as you don't need to touch that money for a few years it is worth the volatility to most people. The reason people have been buying it for the past 8 years and will continue to buy it is the same: it increases in value.
2. Again if it makes them 10x profit every 5 years of hodling people will be willing to do the math on  .00002842btc. Not to mention that is really just simple user interface change and you can simply call it "2842 **mbtc**" instead. So that's not really an issue either.
3. it's true that there are tons of other cryptos, bitcoin might not even be around in 10 years, there could be some other crypto that takes over. But there are already hundreds of different national currencies and yet you can still make transfers easily with things like paypal, so this isn't a problem either. Not to mention there are solutions being developed to make it even easier to make payments between cryptos such as the hyperledger system the ripple is making. The hyperledger protocol, decentralized exchanges, or payment service platforms will make it so that you can send me bitcoin but I will receive ethereum as an example. And these solution will actually be cheaper and faster than trying to pay someone in america with euros for example.
