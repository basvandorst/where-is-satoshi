Anyone using their ticker feed for exchange rates is gonna have issues also.
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:06:57
Is there anyway to scan QRs with this? Or is that beyond the realm of a web-wallet?
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:18:13
You can also use noip.com if you want to register and self host on a dynamic IP.  They started accepting bitcoins a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:01:18
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:03:32
that works??

You should buy a share of GM and a share of Tesla also.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:05:10
Then there will just be new drama.

And while your at it, add an ACL to your API keys.  It sucks that one API key can do anything/everything with your account.

Can anyone explain the "reward halving" that is upcoming?
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:53:37
Is it better to participate in a mega pool (like GHash) or stick with a moderate sized one (like bitminter).  And by better I mean lucrative.  I have a small miner setup that does ~200ghs

They could just use the STUN protocol and hit one of the many public maintained machines.  Probably a lot safer than hitting DYNs IP detection service.  Considering DYN has been slowly getting rid of their DDNS services over the past 2 years.
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:51:15
Why not both?

That site is out of date, Overstock is not even on it.  Noip.com is now accepting BTC if you run an at home server.
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:39:27
I saw a post about these and I am considering getting one and storing it in a safe deposit box.  My question is, I mine with bitminter and have automatic payouts enabled.  Can I have the payout sent to the address of this cold storage card?
tl;dr can you mine to a cold storage address?
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:51:59
Noip.com just started accepting it. So that's something. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:20:19
Searched for "DNS" and "dynamic dns" and only got a router back.  Should show these guys. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:18:50
Noip is in a bunch of routers now, not the case a few years ago but I have seen them in netgears, linksys, tp-link etc...
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:28:05
Looks like they listened to you, they are doing single confirmation now instead of the crazy 6.  noip.com/bitcoin

I'm in for 0.1btc.  But is Lauzon fighting in the UFC anytime soon?

Rule of thumb, if they accept Diners Club, they are probably open to taking alternate payment methods.  Never hurts to ask.

I use bread wallet on IOS.  If I were to take the backup phrase (word list) and import that onto a different device also using bredwallet, could these two devices "share" my bitcoin funds?
Basically trying to set up my wifes phone so that we can share the wallet.
Not saying this is a good idea, just wondering if its possible,

I killed my circle account after waiting 2 weeks for support to tell me why they could not verify my account.  Then their answer sucked.  They are seriously making coinbase look awesome at this point.
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:52:08
Latin Americas payment systems are so backwards, nice to see this happening.
And not all merchants are instantly selling their BTC, I read that noip.com is holding theirs right now.  Which I'm sure they are regretting.

Was stuck there for over 2 weeks.  They wanted a copy of a passport, drivers license and for me to use a computer with a camera on it.  I thought they were kidding.
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:59:33
Bunch of people in my area offer bitcoin via a paypal transaction, look on localbitcoins.  I have no idea how that transaction would work or be safe for the seller but go for it.
@_date: 2015-01-10 16:41:04
no pin or secondary pass-code is a big downer.  The IOS app is on github so maybe I am learning objective-c this spring.

Wait, so any full node can be enrolled in the incentive program?
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:39:45
Having a hard time seeing the use in this still, can someone give me a 2nd grade example of a practical use for it?  Like if I bought one today, what would be something cool I could do with it now (not mining)?
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:43:26
Yay tuesday.
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:37:00
Sending bitcoin across a linked (2m/70cm) repeater system...  This is a fantastic idea.
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:12:08
For IOS, Breadwallet or Mycelium.  For Android then Mycelium

If you got onto circle early, you did not have to jump through a lot of these hoops.  Try creating an account today and its a much different experience.  Coinbase is probably no better I would assume.
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:21:31
Great idea in a tech sense, but wont this reflect negatively on bitcoin?
