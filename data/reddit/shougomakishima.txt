I could be totally off here, but I feel like I've found a pattern. Every thing in the image is oriented at one of five angles (roughly 0°, 30°, 60°, 300° and 330° for simplicity). There are also 12 numbers, 1 through 12 aligned at one of these angles. Now, draw lines cutting through these numbers at the same angle the number is aligned with. Then find bip-39 words on/close to the line which are also aligned at the same angle as the line (and naturally, the number our line is passing through).
I've encircled some words with pencil, also used the green line where some confusion arises. 
Arranging these words in order of 1-12. I've managed to find exactly 24 words (sometimes 26, if I included some words slightly away from these lines, like "tree" or "hour"). In any case, it's still in the ballpark and I'm somewhat confident that this approach might not be entirely incorrect. 
Example of a seed I put together like this : 
either way   sign minimum key coin also attack    rely pool casual power use grow add define satisfy later  else save size modify   tail play
Another question arises : what's the order of words which lie on/near the same line ?

Try cleaning PC with Norton Power Eraser tool and Kaspersky root kit removal tool , then always use some kind of an anti keylogger software (they encrypt keystrokes at a low level) that is running real time. Though I doubt you'll get back those 5 BTC in any way... I feel for you, I hope this will at least act as a trigger to get more people wanting to take extra safety measures, hardware wallet + linux is the best that most non technical people could do.
