Wait a little. Your sum isn’t big enough to justify the fees to move it right now.

Firstly, if bitcoin is meant to be 'decentralized' and somewhat anonymous, why do I have to provide so much information about myself, including ID, to random websites, in order to convert it to anything useful (GBP)?

The best bet to to accept that you won't make money off it and die it as a hobby while also investing fiat to buy bitcoin.

iPad because it looks more professional than printing it on a piece of paper.  
Dedicated because if a customer is trying to pay me I don't want it to be occupied for any other reason. Slowing down the transaction and possibly upsetting the customer.

That's completely different from the question you asked in your heading where you asked why it is difficult. 
To answer your second part: most companies are not listing a "real person's name" in a contact area. They usually have multiple stakeholders and it makes no sense to list a single individual's name. 
I don't put my name on my company's website. 
Also phone support is inefficient. Most questions can and are answered via a FAQ section or email support.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:28:25
Because regardless of whether you are holding or not you wan't the entire ecosystem to survive and thrive.  That requires people to be able to move their money when they want to.
I didn't move mine anywhere.  But for the greater good we want to be able to move our BTC around when need/want.
Without the proper hashrates, as we saw the last 24 hours, it won't happen.  There is much more to this than just hold.

Can you please explain this to me?  I've only been involved with bitcoin since about 2013 so I'm still learning.
When I read the white paper I read something saying "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"...I think.  Don't quote me.
If that is the case can you explain your idea of bitcoin being "a storage of value, like gold is"?

@_date: 2017-11-21 14:18:42
Yes. Please do. 
Profitability isn’t huge. But what you’ll be soon for the network and the diversification of the mining resources will be very helpful. 
Please everyone stop telling anyone who wants to mine about how much more profitable it will be to buy and hold. 
All you’re doing is helping bcash and it’s ringleaders continue to control the mining network. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:52:52

@_date: 2017-11-12 19:56:26
A great entry level way to start mining. About $70 a pop + powered USB hub required. 
Can have half a dozen up and running in 10 minutes. Not very profitable but great to learn mining and don’t operate at a loss. Probably even better now considering the situation. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:29:52
No. That’s as much of an answer as a question like this deserves. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:36:50
Yes. For the sake of the network and the stability of the blockchain it’s a great investment. We need more small time, independent miners. No matter how small they are.

Diversified mining.
BTC isn't decentralized if someone or some few control 80% of the computing power behind it that keeps it alive.
It's even WORSE when most of those people controlling the hashrate are also the same people manufacturing the very equipment that produces that hashrate!

Right. But I’m not questioning the giving of BTC. I’m questioning your being surprised that no one has donated when you yourself don’t even feel that it warrants. 
The fact that something like not receiving free money for knitting a logo and public wallet key, is surprising to you, is in fact surprising to me. 
Apparently my standard for what warrants free money needs from strangers to be lowered. Even if only for the sake of being surprised more often. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:56:05
Not for a while.  Re-securing the current hashrate is priority 
After that clearing the backlogged transactions.
Major issue being some blocks are being solved at BIG profits because of the increase in fees caused by the last 24 hours of panic.
After that we worry about the miners jumping ship again - right back to BCH once those nice premiums are gone.

Mostly, yes. To save on fees I would say instead of once or twice a week just wait until you have $100 ready to go. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:17:33
Yes. That way your max exposure is only $20. About 3 pints at your local bar. If you consider that an investment go for it. Totally safe. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:43:03
So you maxed out your cards and you don't even have 2 bitcoins?

I'm sorry to weigh in on this one but...
They are gone. 
Source: me. 
I did this exact same thing myself about a month and a half ago. Contacted everyone I could. Even offered 50% recovery to 2 of the big name recovery guys. They said it was no use. 
Give up and move on. Know you aren't the only one. 
Edit: never mind. I accidentally sent BCC to BTC address. Same general premise tho. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:31:48
No - I ordered from them in the past.
They simply order large quantities of Bitmain products and mark them up when they are sold out.

It is a fair argument he makes.
He doesn't focus on or start bashing bitcoin.  He is simply pointing out the fact that the investors are valuing something worth $830 million at nearly $2 billion now.  Those individual investors could go out and buy their own bitcoin on their own and nearly double their holdings.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:18:24
Well whatever drinking/partying you do - stop for a couple weeks.
Buy $500 nowish of BTC.
Find other places you're wasting money.  Skip a couple morning coffees at DD and make it at home, have a ramen instead of a steak - wherever you can.
Keep that up until you have saved $500 that you originally would have spent.
In theory, your bank account should reflect the same amount of cash after this.  Plus you'll have .0891 BTC that you can just  let sit and see what happens!

Not sure why that is too little so spend. That should be plenty. That should be around $50
In any event - transfer a larger sum. Maybe .1 btc to the same wallet. Then transfer out the entire .109(minus exact fees) out in one transaction. 
Or just hold the .009 for 10 years and see where that gets you.

You seem very risk adverse and can't handle aggressive investment vehicles. 
For someone like you I would say yes. Sell it and don't look back. If you're that conflicted and stressed over an investment it'll be very difficult for you to continue being vested and not drive yourself crazy.

Hopefully with more users and more understanding spending will increase. 
I spend (and replenish) whenever possible.

I'm sorry but I don't think bitcoin is for you. Really?  $28,000 that you just forgot about?  It's great that you've lived without it but a little fiscal responsibility training may be just what you need. 
I have many times that $28,000 in retirement accounts - and I am sure you do too - but to "forget" about that much is a little crazy!

I buy $200 of bitcoin every week through CoinBase with my CC (my current limit) and it is indeed instant.
When I buy my $1000 every other week via bank account ($2500 limit per month now) it emails me a date 5-9 businesses days ahead telling me transaction will settle.
So it is very odd that you don't see those bitcoin funds immediately.  Call for support.
