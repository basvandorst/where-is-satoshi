Honestly these are my thoughts. I had enough to purchase yesterday, but had a problem with the companies checkout. Stupidly I didn't check fees and the fact BTC had dropped in price which has left me short.
I'm disappointed because Coinbase has already charged me £1 to withdraw the £2 to my bank where I tried to purchase a small amount via Coinbase Pro - I could have covered the fees with that money.

Can anyone help me? I need to complete this transaction within the next 2 hours, and I need 0.00028218 BTC.
Can't use Coinbase or Coinbase Pro as the minimum purchase is £10

My thoughts which is why I didn't bother replying. A lot of people here seem to be getting hurt because I'm criticising BTC, but it's people like myself (who invest money into stocks and have done for years) that you want to encourage to use this.
Heres the thing, I'm not going to buy $100 BTC to buy something that costs $42, in my mind that $58 is now gone. I'd rather not have what I'm buying if it's going to set me back $100 as it's not worth that.
I was interested in BTC and have used it prior back in 2012/13, but for this so survive it needs to be usable - the whole point of this is to move money around. If I can't pay for stuff with BTC what's the point?
Let me know if I'm missing something, because this has been wildly complicated. I shouldn't be losing 15% of my money trying to buy something because of charges (which my bank doesn't have). Yeah my spending isn't private...etc, but it works.

After this experience I'm going to stick to non BTC purchases. Too much hassle

Guess I'll have to, useless currency

RIP, minimum deposit is £10, only deposited £2 - looks like this wont work for me

How? I'm trying to buy something that costs $42, so far it's taken me 2 days, uploading my ID, confirming my address, 3 transactions and a post on Reddit begging for $0.8 of BTC and it's still not purchased.
And also I've lost the best part of £7 due to BTC price and Coinbase fees which they kindly tell me about after I make a withdrawal/purchase. With my credit cards and debit cards I have none of these issues at all.

Thanks for the suggestion, going to do this now!

Any better alternative? New to all of this so I don't really know any better

I'm 21, I get how it works but I just want to buy something. I'm actually trying to spend a currency, I want to buy something. It's taken me 3 days.
Would you be keen to use it after my experience? I've only got 35 minutes before I get my BTC back (Which is worth around £7 less now than it was when I bought it).
Would you still be enthusiastic for BTC if you were me? 
Had this company accepted cards, I would have been able to buy something in the time it took me to respond.
