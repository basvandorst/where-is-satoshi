Right. I understand all of that. And once that happens... game out what the next few steps are likely to be. The GFoC can't hold the rest of Bitcoin hostage, all it can do is to create a Chinese fork of Bitcoin. If everything outside of China started orphaning because of their government policy implemented at the GFoC rather than because of a change in block size, the rest of the network would work around it, right?

It's not clear to me that the schism is unnecessary. Jack Welch created divisions within GE with the express purpose of putting other divisions "out of business."
He didn't do that to harm the existing groups (why would he, they were making a lot of money), he did it because he realized that success can be a prison, and leadership of successful organizations with a lot at stake can become overly cautious, which stifles innovation. So to counter that tendency, he created an environment of cooperative competition.
Create a new group with the incentive to try new ideas, figure out which ideas work and which ones don't, and then roll the successful changes back into the main branch.
That was possible because GE's divisions had strong management teams who understood the purpose and the benefits of the exercise. Innovating on a high-value platform is risky, but slowing innovation is risky too. Cooperative competition can provide a solution, but only if the 'cooperation' part works.

I think a useful way of looking at the Core/XT differences is to think about this in terms of two groups who both want to see Bitcoin succeed, who both realize that in order to do so, Bitcoin needs to scale and to protect itself, but the two groups prioritize those needs differently.
Both viewpoints are valid, and since there's no "right" answer for how quickly Bitcoin needs to scale, it's not surprising that it's hard for those groups to find a compromise position that everyone can live with in terms of security, robustness, censorship-resistance and scaling. 
In order for the two viewpoints to work together more effectively, I think that's what's needed - some level of agreement on how quickly Bitcoin can be or needs to be ready to act as a 'lifeboat' for the next Greece, Brazil, or Venezuela - the next major currency crisis.
For a while, I found myself going back and forth - supporting one side or the other in the scaling debate, but I think I'm past that now. I recognize that both sides have valid concerns (and good ideas), and what we are lacking is a good way of balancing those concerns in a way that makes sense to both perspectives.

That's an excellent description. Very clear, thank you. The issuance limit problem had occurred to me, but I hadn't thought about the mixing of inputs and outputs creating unrecognizable transactions. That would be essentially impossible to 'un-weave.'
I think I'm still in favor of seeing development split, but the cost of doing that certainly seems higher to me now.
@_date: 2015-12-02 17:38:44
Core wants to protect against mistakes that might harm the network. That's a good thing. The problem is that people can endlessly debate any issue without achieving the level of consensus Core apparently needs to feel comfortable introducing changes. 
BIP forks could be a way to gain confidence in proposed changes by generating real-world data to inform the decision-making process. But that's only going to happen if the acrimony stops.
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:36:00
No, you don't necessarily end up with an even bigger advantage for them. Mining conditions change - they have for the entire history of Bitcoin - and rapidly at that. If they change so that more bandwidth is required, then more mining will happen in places with suitable bandwidth. Machines can be sold and moved. Miners don't sign a contract with Bitcoin that their advantages are always going to hold - if they did, there might be some GPU miners with a beef.
@_date: 2015-12-10 17:48:35
If they've sold about 3.2 million of them. I think that would be about 200 extra ph/s.
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:13:58
And my point is they can only be sued if they're "doing it wrong." Adopt the distributed model (like Bitcoin) and you'll be fine. Use the Napster or Silk Road or Coinbase centralized model, and you probably won't be so fine.
Embrace that the future is post-corporate and decentralized, and the things you build should be relatively safe from censorship - including from patent trolls. Instead of depending on an income from your innovation, design in a value-token (an alt-coin) that gains in value when the D-app is successful and pre-mine and then continue to mine those tokens - just like everyone else running a node.
@_date: 2015-12-22 15:57:55
Which is exactly what would happen in the scenario we're discussing - consensus rules would change. You think the rest of the network just gives up and packs it in if block size becomes an issue or China's government decides to start playing latency games with the firewall? Bitcoin's not that fragile.

What if Satoshi already gave people the answer in the form of the blockchain? Fork.

@_date: 2015-12-11 18:52:51
No it won't. What I'm advocating is that XT drop the 75% mining adoption requirement, pick a date for activation, and then everyone can move forward with different consensus rules on two sides of a permanent fork.
I can't predict with certainty if emphasizing security over growth or growth over security is the best long-term approach for Bitcoin, and I doubt anyone else can either, so why shouldn't Bitcoin explore more than one evolutionary path? 
It seems like that would maximize its long term chances for success and let developers spend more time developing and less time feeling the need to defend what's ultimately a legitimate philosophical difference of opinion.
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:17:39
TL;DR: There's a mash-up in the crypto-world that is just starting to be understood by people other than those already building the infrastructure and those closely watching them - decentralized apps that exchange either Bitcoin or a domain-specific Alt-coin (like Ether) as 'fuel.' The amount of change these apps could rapidly introduce into the world is truly stunning if you think about some of the possibilities. Described below are a few of the possibilities I see (and the potential benefits).
And what's really exciting is that D-apps are right at that development stage that we always seem to recognize only in retrospect, where two kids working together in a garage can change the world. With D-apps, I think the path between garage ideas and global positive impact may be shorter than with any technology we've ever seen before.
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:01:31
What I'm trying to point out is that this is a lot of worry about something that's unlikely to be a problem. Patents don't mean much in the crypto-world - innovation does. And an easy way to see that is - try suing a D-app for patent infringement.
@_date: 2015-12-14 15:07:02
The problem I have with the 75% threshold is that it's very easy for the XT side to see it as being a measurement of consensus, but it's also very easy for the Core side to see it as both coercion and an existential threat to the viability of a small-chain, high-security approach. It pushes the community towards an all-or-nothing decision point.
I think the Bitcoin community is in a lose-lose scenario if either all-or-nothing approach wins out. We're in less of a lose-lose scenario if a compromise could be reached that keeps developers on the same project, but we're in potentially more of a win-win scenario with a soft fork that you can decide to support or not, with pre-fork coins, at some point in the future after each path has more of a track record.
I agree that waiting for sidechains, LN, treechains, Rootstock, etc. might have been better, but I like that XT exists as running code, because simply by existing it mitigates the risk of the "Crash Landing" scenario Mike Hearn described in a blog post earlier this year, even if it never activates.

You only need as many nodes as there are users if you assume a completely trust-less society. ITRW people *do* trust other people they personally know and interact with on a regular basis, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

If the premise of XT is correct, then it shouldn't need any inducements for adoption other than the benefits of its distinguishing features. And if the premise is wrong, then it should be orphaned. So what's wrong with allowing the free market to decide which version they want to run with no acceptance-level trigger?
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:29:15
I understand wanting to grow things conservatively, but these are silly reasons. 8mb blocks full of bitcoin transactions is a 'worst case scenario?' Not for most people. Most people are waiting to see those kinds of transaction numbers.
Mining migrates to where it's favorable to mine. Currently that means cheap power. If in the future that means finding the best balance of cheap power and high bandwidth, then that's where mining will happen. I think mining 'bandwidth' is more of an invented problem that serves as cover for a conservative development agenda.
Why hide it? There's nothing wrong with being conservative with the development of a multi-billion dollar asset. I'm all for that.

I think splitting Bitcoin development makes sense. The problem we have right now is that there are two philosophical positions - cautious growth and rapid growth. 
Neither of those views is "right" or "wrong" - they are just premised on different beliefs about what future risks might look like. It's hard enough to get people to agree about what happened in the past. Getting people to agree on what's likely to happen in the future is impossible, so there's no 'mending' this rift.
I think the two perspectives could better cooperate and benefit from one another if individuals didn't feel like they had to compete to control the direction of one single Bitcoin 'ship.'
There are places in the world where Bitcoin can grow more rapidly than Core is comfortable with. 
There are places in the world where Bitcoin can't grow at all unless Core keeps it resistant to censorship and attack.
Why restrain both approaches by keeping them chained to one another?
@_date: 2015-12-22 17:25:35


Especially vs. the 'fight over the steering wheel' approach that we have instead. It really seems like that approach would solve the problems 101 proponents are (legitimately, imo) worried about, while not creating a new set of larger ones.

He also said some things about Blockstream's approach to developer support, sidechains, and LN, that I think need a wider audience. Those comments certainly cleared up some information gaps I had.
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:29:13
I agree with that, but I also think that the more engaged we can keep the development community, the stronger all of our options become. And I'm not sure how we do that without letting different paths find their own level of market support. Also, a 'divided' Bitcoin would still have at least 15 million bitcoin that would be valid on all paths, and there's nothing that says that forks couldn't merge to a common set of consensus rules later down the road.
That said, I'm a sidechain fan as well, and would love to see an XT sidechain rather than the current situation with the 75% mining threshold, which I think is a mistake that invites conflict instead of cooperation.

I don't know about that. I agree it would be disruptive, but I'm not sure that having multiple 'paths' of Bitcoin is necessarily a bad idea. 
Putting all hope on a single path for developing a crypto-currency from an idea in someone's head to a world-changing thing seems risky from certain perspectives too. I look at forking as a potential strength that hasn't been duly explored.

No need to appeal to authority, just collect information and make up your own mind. Austin Hill has done a pretty good job of explaining Blockstream's intent, imo: 
If you have evidence that what he's saying is false, that would be interesting to see. Absent evidence, it's hard for me to see the Blockstream concerns as anything other than a conspiracy theory that conveniently 'explains' a situation that some people don't understand - that Core is trying to minimize the chance that they break Bitcoin, by managing changes conservatively.
The debate about what's conservative vs. what's too conservative is a lot easier to have if people don't immediately jump to conspiracy thinking.

luke-jr, are you suggesting that the Bitcoin network should be content enforcing rather than content neutral? Advocating for blacklists like Hearn did?
@_date: 2016-03-01 23:41:54
Well said. I think the solution is to turn these decisions into prediction market bets by creating a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain for each strategy. After a brief dev and miner election, alternative proposals should just create a new hedge fork, and take a copy of everyone's bitcoin along with them. No need for endless conferences and reddit threads if we just settled differences of opinion that way.
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:09:13
I'd like to see both 'visions' of Bitcoin continue because I see value (and risks) with both approaches to growth. So after a lot of thought, I'm fine with 75%, and I hope that if a hard fork to a larger block approach happens, there will still be enough support for Core's approach, even if that's then seen as being a fall-back 'secure' Bitcoin with less attention. The most important thing to me is that developers continue to be able to collaborate on ideas and implement the best ones which are still compatible with their strategy for how Bitcoin should scale.

@_date: 2016-03-01 02:42:28
I think it's okay to have miners choose which alternative they want to have change PoW, and so some sort of miner election makes sense. But since there's no way to avoid people thinking that different interests are trying to influence the outcome, the duration of that election should be brief, imo - just to limit the amount of distraction.
But I absolutely wouldn't want to see them mine a new genesis block. If an alt is intending to be a 'hedge fork' for bitcoin, then I want my bitcoin - or at least a copy of them, to go along for the ride.

It's been a while since I read up on the numbers, but I believe Uber takes ~ 20-25%. A D-app only needs to pay for compute power and network access. No big offices. No payback of VC investment, and most important - no payment of armies of lawyers to lobby local jurisdictions to allow it to operate there.
D-apps don't need legal permission, just the ability to solve a problem people need solved.
So I think it's very possible that instead of costing a driver 20+ percent of their income, the next version might cost them less than 1%.

I'm sure Uber could put up a fight for a while, but it's a losing game for them since they have debt that must eventually be paid back.

So their business model is trivial to copy by anyone willing to take that final step towards creating a decentralized digital ~~business~~ service.

Mining difficulty increases all the time, so the amount of bitcoin available for each mining rig becomes more scarce. If the miners adding all of that hashpower got their equipment for less than you did (likely) and get electricity cheaper than you can (also likely), then over time there's a very good chance that your payback date will keep adjusting outwards so you never break even. You also need to consider that the mining reward is going to be cut in half later this year.

Actually, I think there will be one authority left, but it's a legitimate one - the authority of market regulation. I see Bitcoin continuing to provide a content-neutral store of value and backbone distribution network with lots of content-enforcing D-apps providing services in ways that their efficacy and harm-reduction will be verifiable on their own block chains, due to protocol design, with the market deciding which apps (and thus which approaches to solving problems) survive and which ones don't.
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:33:31
It very well could happen that way, but Bitcoin was not quite as prominent as it is now the first time this happened. With 21.co and BitFury and possibly other manufacturers stepping up, I think his belief is that there might be a more equitable distribution of ASICs this time around.

To me, that sounds like what is happening. Bitcoin is very conservative about growth. That's one way to do crypto. Slow and safe(r) growth. 
Ethereum is following a different trajectory. They want to try to scale faster and run Turing complete scripts, etc. and we'll see what happens. 
If things work out, then one day there could be a closer link between the two.  I like that there are multiple approaches out there, because it means there's less pressure on any one development team to adopt a growth strategy that makes everyone happy - which is impossible.

That makes sense - any barrier to entry whether it's a capital requirement, specialized knowledge, or cooperative regulators would seem to do the trick.
But in terms of capital barriers, as long as the investment required to participate at a competitive level is in generally available equipment with commodity pricing, then the effects should be less severe.
So maybe proof of work isn't dead conceptually - just ASIC friendly proof of work.

I can see benefits to that approach then - once the issues get worked out. My belief is that crypto currency development should be a team sport, and there should be more than one team in the 'league.' 
I think we'll get much more innovation and safety once the market is more easily able to 'govern' crypto development by expressing support for one idea vs. another as circumstances in the environment change.
I'd like to see Classic blaze this trail by changing proof of work (I've actually put up a proposal for doing that on Classic's consider.it), and becoming an alt (that forks the bitcoin blockchain) for now and eventually a sidechain.
If protecting against a "fee event" is important, then I think an alt which has already attracted some hashpower and is up and running, would be a better option to keep the economy flowing than waiting 28 days for a hard fork - if there's a problem. And an alt that branches from the main blockchain would in a very real sense be "backing up" everyone's coin on more than one growth strategy - which I see no downside to.
Essentially, I think if you're operating in an environment where pursuing multiple strategies simultaneously is an option and you choose not to do it, then you're crippling your chances for success.

They probably should have worded the "We are hard forking bitcoin" thing a bit more accurately. They're releasing a new client with different consensus rules; the miners decide if a hard fork happens or not.
It might be an urgent problem - I don't know, nor do I think anyone knows for sure. Adam Back seems to be pretty confident that either blocks won't fill up before SegWit or it won't be a problem, but I think most people would say - can't know for sure, because we haven't been here before.
If Core's position was well researched and thought-out and there's time enough to wait for SegWit to relieve the capacity strain without seeing bad effects from a fee event, then everything should be cool. If not, then things get more interesting.

Hmmm. I guess I'm not following your logic here. Who would produce those ASICs and what incentive would the producer have to offer them for sale to the public rather than using them to monopolize the hash rate?

Just kidding, but actually - has anyone seriously considered the possibility that *any* POW that relies on capital build-out and benefits from data-center efficiency is destined to fall under monopoly control as it scales? 
When capital intensive industries are unregulated, they tend to fall under monopoly and/or cartel control, do they not? And even when they are regulated, they eventually subvert the regulators. At least that's what my reading of our economic history seems to suggest.

In this case... irony.

Join the flock? Thanks, I'm good.

Or it could be that he's just not experienced using the subjunctive mood in English. How's your Bengali? I'm guessing not as good as the OP's English.

It would be interesting to see if similar techniques could be applied to decision making around the future of Bitcoin. At the moment, it seems like we have 21st century money, governed by the same old clique-based and conflict-based political processes that many of us realize have outlived their usefulness for developing consensus.

I'm content to let my choice of words speak for itself, thanks.

But what if it was Seven of Nine?

In the long run, this may actually help Bitcoin in a couple of ways. If the attacks continue, that will tend to drive people towards storing their critical information in encrypted decentralized cloud storage, and those kinds of solutions will be built to run using digital crypto currencies like Bitcoin.
The attacks also serve to transfer value from fiat to Bitcoin directly, which is directly good for Bitcoin. A fresh whale, whether entrepreneur or thief, is going to want to spend some of that fresh coin, and that moves it around the economy, spreading its value.
So while I don't support ripping people off - I'd much rather see value transfer into crypto economies via the voluntary choice of consumers in a free marketplace. I do have to acknowledge that the crypto-locking thieves aren't actually working against crypto, though they may give it a black eye in the short-term.

But that's a warning, not a game-plan, and it's not likely to work unless you have a monopoly. If there were two 'brands' of legal tender in the US - USD-1 and USD-2, and the central bank controlling USD-1 decided to engage in QE, while the bank controlling USD-2 kept the money supply fixed, wouldn't rational actors immediately crater the value of USD-1 by fleeing to USD-2?

"There is always war"
Or at least contentiousness.
