There was a general market fragility in crypto after the massive price increases in December. That fragility wasn't caused by any one government, it was caused by a sense that prices had gone too high too fast and that a big correction was inevitable. The early January bust didn't feel like it was done, which meant lots of people felt they missed the chance to sell and didn't want to get burnt again. 
The South Korea stuff had a market impact because that fragility was already there.

Zerohedge is a Russian disinfo site that reliably takes the Kremlin line on finance, Ukraine, Syria etc while stoking conspiracy theories.

I don't think Zerohedge's links to Russia are particularly secret or hidden.

If you can't do basic multiplication then you are taking a big risk doing your own investing. How can you calculate risk properly or understand your exposure?

I bet most of those wallets have never made a trade. Creating an account is easy. Getting verified is so much of a hassle that most people burn out.

I think you're confusing 'property', i.e. something that can be owned, and 'real property', i.e. land. 
You don't pay an annual 'property tax' on stuff that you own, eg diamond rings or rare stamps or bearer bonds or Monet paintings. And you won't pay it on Bitcoins either under the current treatment.  You'd only be liable at the point that you sell them.

Stolen goods are probably accounted for as exceptional income
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:55:32
Ordinary income is what I think we'd call gross income. 
The big jump in profit is because it's clearly based on ludicrous predictions about the increase in Bitcoin volume in the next couple of years (it'll be big but not that big that quickly) and, most importantly, about Gox keeping anything more than a tiny sliver of a market share of the exchange market. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:05:29
But you _do_ have to pay taxes on profits on your foreign currency holdings already. You don't have to pay it on unrealised assets. 
If you only want to pay tax on your realised profit and not on your unrealised holdings then you are in luck: That's what the current IRS treatment does! 
You seem to be saying that you want the IRS to define it as a currency but to still tax it as an asset?
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:47:24
Stock/inventory held by a business is relevant for tax purposes because you use it to determine profit. You don't usually pay tax on the inventory held itself.

$350? I decided to buy in at $3.50! Downloaded Bitcoin-qt... took several days to get the blockchain due to slow internet connection. Then when it was done I went to an exchange, but they wanted bank account verification... by then the price had gone up to $5 or something so I decided that it wasn't worth the effort
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:21:38
I understand the position is similar in the UK. If Bitcoin was treated as a currency for tax purposes, the 2013 rise would have wiped people out. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:05:44
At this point, the market must have broadly priced in the various risks. 
The only real systematic risk to Bitcoin is if the 750k coins were really stolen _and_ they are all in the control of a small number of people. It's too market-breaking. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 16:15:37
That is absolutely not the case at all. Have a read of the court judgements that actually assessed the evidence. They deal with that claim.

No,  they probably _do_ know the position with MtGox but have collectively decided not to officially confirm it yet for some market reason. Maybe they want the official statement to come from Gox and not from 'rival' exchanges. Hence all of the vagueness and equivocation. Probably also why the "insolvency" line was pulled from the press release. 
They are actually behaving responsibly. Once they start confirming things that Gox told them, then they might be responsible for any actions others take based on that info, which might later turn out to be inaccurate. 
Give the other exchanges a break here. They're doing their best. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 09:59:45
Nonsense. You'd be taxed on _unrealised_ profits if it was a currency, meaning that anyone who bought at $250 would be liable for taxes now, even if they were holding the coins and not selling. 
Treating as a currency would possibly benefit day-traders but would be much worse for the small investor/Bitcoin owner and believer. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:25:25
Surely if they did this, they'd use their own internal ledgers. So I'd have to, say, pay Facebook $10 to get 90 tip-points, each worth 10c or something. What incentive would they have to use a cryptocoin rather than their own internal "facecoins" or whatever? 
@_date: 2014-04-18 11:15:01
You realise Bitcoins aren't tangible assets?

The New York Times was what the New York Times should have been. It was them (and the Guardian) that actually published Manning's leaks. Assange was just a middleman. 
I would note that Times reporters haven't been arrested for publishing the leaks. 
Assange is cooped up because he refuses to return to Sweden to answer rape charges.

What was that I don't even
What a bizarre mix of hippie imagery, bitcoin as an asset/way of making a profit, bitcoin as fun and exciting, and 'trashcash' weirdness. 
It's like this was made by 12-year-olds in a media studies lesson. No clarity of message, no coherence, and it screams 'amateur' so loudly that if I was new, I'd be scared to trust the Mycellium wallet of anyone who uses it.

This would be Henry Ford, author of [The International Jew]( promoter of anti-semitic conspiricy theories, publisher of the virulantly antisemitic [Dearborn Independent]( closed down for racism in 1927? Henry Ford who believed that the world banking system was run by a Jewish conspiricy to cause wars?
Henry Ford who promoted the idea that the First World War was caused by the Jews, an idea that inspired Hitler? Hitler kept a life-size portrait of Ford in his office, and praised him in Mein Kampf. 
Henry Ford blamed the Jews for ruining baseball and chocolate, but mostly he blamed them for banking and the monetary system. 
But [Ford didn't say this!]( 
This quote is a summary of Ford's views by [Russell McGuire in the American Mercury] ( in 1957. The American Mercury was an antisemitic publication at this time. They even employed George Lincoln Rockwell, who went on to found the American Nazi party. 
The article by Russell McGuire which uses this quote, "How Internationalists Gain Power" claims that US liberal movements are secretly funded by sinister international financiers who are control capitalism, socialism and communism and are trying to conquer national governments. Oh, and also they hate Jesus. The Ford reference was included as a dog whistle just in case the reader, somehow, missed the antisemitism.
So... maybe this isn't the best quote to be posting around?

100% correct. I noted this [further down the thread]( It ALSO wasn't said by Ford, but was another famous antisemite summing up Ford. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 11:25:18
Yup, it's [an article]( in the antisemitic American Mercury, by Russell McGuire. Not actually said by Ford.

It could contain the access number to a numbered Swiss account. 
It could contain the private cryptographic key to a Bitcoin wallet.

You usually pay 3% on the spread for a foreign-currency ATM withdrawal. Depending on where you are, sometimes street change places can be as low as 1% on the spread.
