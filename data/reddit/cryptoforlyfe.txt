Just check out the latest transactions for the latest Block. If a transaction has either more than 1 input or more than 2 outputs then it was batched. Most of them are

Use CANWork.io - Upwork but with crypto

Lightning Network: send your Bitcoin across a network of nodes. Each channel interfaces to the Bitcoin Blockchain.
Good for small, quick e-commerce payments. 
Liquid Sidechain: send your Bitcoin to a secondary Blockchain that interfaces to the Main  Blockchain via a single Multi-sig account. 
Good for sending large amounts of Bitcoin between institutions.

Yes I agree. I wouldn't hold my coins on anything apart from a Blockchain cold wallet, but would certainly use the side-chain

Can't wait to see atomic Multi-path payments in action! Will be a game-changer

So when u send your Bitcoin to Binance; do u trust that the "Bitcoin" in your account is exactly equal to Bitcoin? 
Of course you do; so therefore you would trust sending your Bitcoin to an account that requires 2 dozen separate entities to ask agree.
If you still don't, you are most welcome not to use it

Recent analysis has almost 90% of Bitcoin volume to be fake so a sell off would most certainly cause a decline.

Are u talking about Bech32? It was included as part of the SegWit fork but not dependent on SegWit. 
Bech32 has a human readable part (bt) a separator (0) then the address, with the last four as a checksum. Total up to 90 characters. 
The Old address has the human readable part (1) then 33 characters.
I would say based simply on number of combinations to hack if u had a quantum computer go with Bech32

In this case, your buddy sends u another 0.5 BTC on-chain but to *your* LN wallet address. This "fills" the channel back up and requires 2/2 going forward. It is like recharging a channel. 
Also - u won't be opening channels with your friends. You'll be opening channels with highly connected regional hubs, and so will your friends.

That’s the new Segwit bech32 address format

Layer 2 protocols will accelerate the next phase of Bitcoin adoption. Just like the Rooststock RSK MainNet launch

Is this a weighted average score of fungibility, divisibility, transferability and adoption?
@_date: 2018-04-14 09:47:32
You will fairly soon! Give it 3-6 months

Yup. "since activation" shows good and continuing increase in adoption

Even with LN the required blocksize is 133mb but we'll take a while to get there. 
I think of my LN wallet as my new hot wallet. Each time I recharge my hot wallet it is on-chain (no change from how it is today)

$20 per channel
So if we get to 100m channels there will be $2bn effectively taken out of trading circulation. 
I personally think we will see an average much higher than - perhaps around $1000 per channel. 
The material impact this will have on bitcoin price is often overlooked IMO

We had an all time high of shorts on Bitcoin. Even higher than when we were at $20k. Yes it may been manipulated to push it into the shorts, but $150m of liquidation caused the movement. 
There was plenty of manipulation around the $6500 Mark (or support rather) but u cannot deny the change in sentiments.

Haha. PayPal forcing me to hodl fiat. Can't think of anything worse.
