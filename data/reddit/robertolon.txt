Hey mathiasbk, I have just launched a trade history, please let me know what you think.
edit: Only for future orders

If I understand correctly, you can open btc-e and use that information since I get the values from there. I think I wanted to build something that would be obsolete once you get more experience.

Is it okay to ask for donations for these kind of things?
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:22:13
Soon! I have built the simulator to easily add other currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:52:02
thanks for your answer prof7bit
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:01:11
hey thanks!!
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:28:16
Thanks!! :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:25:19
that's what I'm doing! It's already free, I thought this would be an extra. Like most games nowadays, you get them for free, and if you want more fake extra inside-game money, you pay for it.
Just check it out, and tell me what you think!
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:02:53
done! thanks
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:57:35
Enjoy your new credit :)

Not yet, sorry. I have built the system as to support this function, but I have not implemented the actual function yet. This is only a simple prototype, I will be improving it.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:02:30
I'm really sorry. It was a bug, a mistake I made, it charged 2% instead of 0.2% for each transaction. Please tell me your (sudogift.com) username and I'll fix that for you.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:52:46
I chose 0.2% because I use BTC-E values, and that's what they charge I *think*
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:51:06
You mean that I open my own exchange?? Or that I allow to use other exchanges with my user interface?
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:05:05
Yeah, it's a good idea. I may implement something like that in following days/weeks.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:32:18
Would anyone be interested in getting more inside-simulator fake money or BTC to practice, in exchange for 0.001 REAL BTC? :)
(only if this app helps you, I'm not interested in charity)
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:27:10
Done! Please check the new trade history and tell me your feedback!

I wanted the simulator to be an easy layer to remove when you feel comfortable enough to trade for real. The simulator uses btc-e prices, so using btc-e web you can get all your info there, and make the exchange on the simulator.

@_date: 2013-12-02 02:02:55
Yes! This is definitely on my roadmap. I just wanted to release something usable really fast.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:44:51
Honestly, I have not consider it yet. I know that opensourcing a project it's not only making the repo public and I know that it takes time, so I might do it after I finish some features I want to build.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:39:23
that's harsh ser tom. I'm just a dude coding on my spare time after university classes because I like building stuff.
Some people really enjoyed what I've built, you can see my reddit user replying to people.
Server cost money. I live in south america where you've got to pay 35% more of what you pay for it because stupid regulation taxes.
So if people enjoy what I've built, I see no crime in asking for $1 dollar to get more fake money on my simulator. Not only that, but I also give free fake money to try it out, even practice with  that.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:18:42
I believe I'm providing a real service with real value, not just fake money. Or that's what other people have been telling me when I showed them what I've built.
edit: And you actually have to pay to purchase a monopoly, no one will give it for free :)
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:28:33
Thanks for your reply!
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:27:26
You're right, sorry!
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:02:45
It currently uses btce values
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:34:20
Is it okay to copy the QR code at the right  ?
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:27:55
It's just a prototype, I will iterate over it. Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:53:26
puedo pedir yo también?
