LOL who the fuck is buying rn ����
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:26:50
Need I overstate the obvious? I was early. Not 2009 early. But summer 2015 early. Earlyish. Only three years ago. Bought at 605 and 705. Currently sits 11,300. Merely a month ago WE WERE ALL DYING OF JOY THAT 'Will it hit 10k?' fever was coming on. Crash? My asscrack. True noobs should not even be ruffled. This kind of BTC behavior ALWAYS results in 'To the moon, Alice.' Relax and buy this delicious dip. You will thank yourself later. (And be joyous if you did not fall in with Bitconnect.)
Sincerely, Lieutenant Obvious, Corn Battalion

Imagine not listening to me ����
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:25:26
It’s going to keep doing this guys. Drop, drop and then rise a bit (fake recovery) and then drop even lower. Be patient before putting any more in, the ‘dip’ is far from over.

Nope. It is run by a bunch of very smart con-artists who know how to take advantage of a totally unregulated market.

People need to understand that this is a bear market - this is going to keep happening. Be patient, hold what you have, and wait for the mood to change. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:07:33
Two reasons why I think we are in a bear market:
(a) We've just seen probably the biggest bubble in crypto history (that being the explosion in BTC's price over Dec) burst, and a lot of new people who got into crypto over the hype have been burned bad. Whereas before the general mood towards crypto was very positive, now people are licking their wounds and behaving more cautiously. This means, on aggregate, that investors are (i) less likely to invest when they see positive news / movements in the price, and (ii) more likely to sell when things start to dip. Everyone is on edge, and for many these small upswings in price are simply a way for them to recover some of the losses they have incurred. This is not a mood conducive to long term upwards growth (i.e. a bull market). You have to remember that so many new people have got into crypto on the basis that they might 'get rich quick'; they couldn't care less about the technology or its long term success, and are losing interest now that the hype is gone.
(b) There have been a number of recent problems with certain exchanges that are shaking peoples' faith in the security of their investments. BitGrail has just turned out to be a massive scam, Binance has been having issues, and there was an exchange (can't remember the name) just the other day that was hacked. This adds to the general sense of fear (cf. optimism) that, I believe, the market is feeling. 
I think the key point is that many of the new investors who entered the crypto market in Dec, who were largely responsible for the massive increase in BTC's price, have been badly burned by their experiences. Without that influx of new cash the prices of many of these coins are simply unsustainable, and it is going to take time for the market to bottom out.
Hope that is helpful.
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:08:06
I agree with this.

Gonna copy a comment I made yesterday.

Yeah, classic bull trap unfortunately. Patience is key.

Get a fucking grip on reality pal
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:00:15
So, next time the price skyrockets (if it ever does again), and you see people defiantly claiming that "it's not a bubble!!!", tell them to fuck off
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:43:19
HAHAHAHA holy fuck
