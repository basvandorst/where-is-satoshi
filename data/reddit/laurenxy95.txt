More efficient mining machines - Less energy for higher hash rate
A bigger propotion using sustainable energy - More eco-friendly mining
[ 
But the sustainable energy part seems to apply more to big mining farms than to individuals? I guess it depends on where electricity in your area comes from though. But has anyone got solar power panels for your own electricity? :D

Bitcoin at the moment has shown immense potential in value storage ( but not yet in widesperad value transfer/exchanges (actually spending/using). With time it could be both.

Hyperinflation, trade wars, or anything that jeopardizes the value of fiat money or existing monetary system.

Thoughts on the value of Bitcoin: Its value consists of two parts. First, the consensus value of the entire Bitcoin network. Second, the sum of the value of asset exchanges generated under the weak trust environment enabled by the blockchain.
The current price of Bitcoin mostly reflects the first part. But consensus can be very fragile sometimes, and that resulted in the large fluctuations in Bitcoin prices.
However, the value of being able to achieve efficient resource allocation under a weak trust environment is very stable, and the asset exchange volume will become larger and larger. We shall patiently wait for this to take over the value of Bitcoin.

HODL because:
1. The pressure of global currency overshooting is reaching a critical point. The time of negative interest rates has come, and various signals are getting on people’s nerves. In US, FED just inject 53 billion into the market. In China, examples are exchange rates, CPI, and RRR cuts. This is like a balloon that keeps expanding and might just explode all of a sudden.
2. Only two main ways for big capitals to access Bitcoin: minnig and OTC markets. The overall computing power has been getting higher. This recent surge in computing power is an important signal.
3. Bitcoin halving coming in May. The chart has been flat for a while, and there’s not much time left to wait and see.

Sept. 4th, a day to remember:
Two years ago today, seven Chinese central government regulators jointly issued an announcement to ban local exchanges and ICOs from operating.
It set off a drastic drop of Bitcoin price (well, not nearly as drastic as the rise later that year), and led to turbulence in the blockchain scene in China.
Interestingly, today an online course was released, featuring a senior official from China's central bank talking in details about Libra and the upcoming state-issued digital currency/electronic payment.

The course is only available on a Chinese online course mobile app.
Here's the [course syllabus page]( on PC (unclickable).
Here's [an article]( (in Chinese) covering this course. Couldn't find any in English.
