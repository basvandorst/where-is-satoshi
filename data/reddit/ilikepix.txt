So you're saying that it's more likely that there's some conspiracy among bankers, politicians and money-men to fake a public bitcoin extortion racket involving a national presidential candidate in order to discredit a virtual currency most people have never heard of rather than there's some lone jackass who thought i) this might be funny and/or ii) some idiots might send him some free BTC?

For anyone with experience in internet sales, this statement is staggering.
Something as simple as setting up a new account is an absolutely *huge* disincentive to potential customers. *Massive*. Think about how many people won't bother to sign-up for a free account to read an article or test a new webapp, then mix in suspicion at having to trust your financial details with yet another third party, and suddenly you're not talking about a "few people" but vast swathes of your market.

The more BTC are used, the higher the velocity and the greater the effective money supply

Why? The still allow chargebacks, take the money from the recipient and charge a $35 chargeback fee. They also have dispute resolution in which they are the sole and final arbiter. What makes them better than PayPal?

Yeah, I have no idea why no-one is considering the US government secretly buying intel in order to secretly program CPUs in order to prevent bitcoin replacing the US dollar. No idea.
