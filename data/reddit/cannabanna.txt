also one of the main reasons gold can be used as a global currency is because of its relative scarcity. gold is pretty much evenly distributed on the surface of the earth. what changes is how much gold is dug out. so basically no1 can ever have a real monopoly on all the gold, because some country can just say fine well just dig more up and then trade it. relatively even distribution of gold ensures every country can use gold, not just some people. also gold doesn't rust, is malleable and can be used for all the things you mentioned, which makes it the best natural currency out there. diamonds would probably be a good interplanetary currency (ala 'the day the world stood still' from the 50s.) where it is relatively available, yet not too easy to take out or refine, but still has value because it can be used for so many things. bitcoin, is completely fiat. it is practically not different from the dollar. only how it is exchanged and how it is created have been changed. it still becomes completely valueless and useless if it's not used. for example, if the oil industry stopped trading in petrodollars, the dollar would lose majority of its value simply because they will no longer be in demand and not used to trade with. they will not be used in other currency exchanges and they will not be created or bought for the biggest market on the planet.
