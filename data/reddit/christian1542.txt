Well, I am the guy who graduated at the top of the class in EE and went to Con Edison. Of course, not really EE and Con Edison but you get the point. I got screwed so royally for that that I am never going back to that field. Since management got off scot-free, like they always seem to do, I decided to live off investing instead. Then I got acquainted with trading from there. I do well, it is not my passion or anything though. Sure, I could do something useful instead, but I'd rather not. To do that, first I would have to take shit from asshole professors, then I have to take shit from asshole HR, and finally take shit from some asshole boss. 
You seem like a guy with a healthy dislike of the hedge fund industry. How come you don't write a book on what exactly your ex employer did?

Stop orders are not visible to anyone with access to the order book. Certainly not retail traders. This is something someone even remotely familiar with the matter would know. I guess you really didn't work for the hedge fund industry after all and are just making up stuff based on gossip you have read from the web or books.
Now, you could always prove me wrong by providing some source, but I would be surprised if I see a reply.

Thanks for the info. I live in a country (Finland) with a well educated population but here almost nobody is doing any hedge fund stuff or even plain retail trading. What books or other sources do you recommend that explain well what the NYC guys are doing?

Now I am curious, how do they do the stop hunt? The limit orders are of course for everyone to see in the order book, but is there another order book with all the stop orders? The exchanges could make good money from selling that information. Even big brokers could sell that information of their clients, does that happen or is there some confidentiality clause protecting the clients?

how is that possible, why isn't anyone arbitraging that?

I have always wondered, are the nyc trader guys really the kind of arrogant douches that some circles make them out to be?
