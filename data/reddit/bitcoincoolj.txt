Why did you tumble your clean coins 
Also unless they were new bitcoins I'm sure they were already tainted but it's hard to tell 
@_date: 2016-04-12 04:02:11
Better then down $8

Okay, to save money on fees will take a lot of adoption or correct me if I’m wrong, 
Say you own a computer store and I regularly need computer parts so I open a channel with you, and comes the end of the month you need money to buy new product you have to close the channel and cash out to buy new product I’d have to open a channel every month.
But if your supplier accepted bitcoin and lightning network could you keep my channel open and use my money to buy your supplies and the channel will never have to close as long as you can buy everything you need on the lightning network and then close the channel once yearly to finalise all transactions ?
And if it does work this way if your supplier needed to cash out and you used my money to buy from him will you have to close my channel so his channel can close ?
Cheers for the help 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:18:46
But if you look at the LONG term if it only costs $30 for say a shop or an employer and you to open a channel for x amount of time the shop will save $$$ On transactions and fees that private banking and visas charge and this lowers overheads and they can lower prices on products 
My current bank charges me $5 a month just to have an account 
That’s $60 a year so if I only have to pay to open the channel and close the channel once a year I’d be paying the same price and have better control of my money and payments will be super quick 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:21:08
Yeah but the channel should stay open 
So I could open one channel for weeks or months and that’s only one transaction so there will be less on chain transactions with more adoption of the lightning network 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:21:49
Ahh yes this clears somethings up for me mate

First time I bought from btc markets my bank put my account on hold and didn’t call me and I didn’t know untill I went to buy fuel and my card declined and my app said I had money but it wasn’t working and I couldn’t call them because it was after houses so I had to look like a dodgy cunt and say I’ll come back with my mrs bank card.
The next day I called them and they said they thought it was fraud and put my account on hold to protect me 
:/

It was hacked in 2013,
For some reason it’s still online.
Putting in your email address could lead to being hacked so stay away. 
Any updates on this hack since then would be good 
I lost plenty of bitcoin on this site :/

@_date: 2018-01-10 15:18:24

eBay has some for like $8 if you in Aus 
Or cheaper else were I think I saw some on the UK site 
But the accounts should be region free

I don't think much will happen this year 
Good time to buy ?
But not much will happen 
Stay around $500 or less 
And you will get board 
Or scared of it drops to low and cash out 
I think short term investment days are over..
Buy now
Then hold for 10 years 
And come back in 2026 and ask if it's a good year to sell

@_date: 2019-03-23 10:19:31
all they have to do is download an app on a phone and hover your camera over the code for half a second and then they will control to send the btc,
if the staff were already into btc they could just pull their phone out or print a public key and stick it to their name tag or something 
if one only had a debit card how would you tip the staff?
would they need to have their own terminal 
or would it go to the shop then the shop would have to do all the pain in the arse shit on the shops side

He made Aus coin and had around 30 Bitcoin ATMs in Australia 
He had a lambo 
Don't know what exchange he had unless it was just the auscoin to Bitcoin ATMs 
@_date: 2019-03-11 05:40:05
Yeah that's deff what he was arrested for.
Just saw on here last week or the week before about this but couldn't find what exchange was closed 
So just an update to people who were interested about the case.
This guy was in the news in Jan 2019
 saying he was still bullish on Bitcoin and the dip didn't phase him ect 
So either that made police look into why this guy is so rich 
Or they were already on his case 
Don't you hate when you boast about getting rich trading Bitcoin but then get arrested for drug trafficking

This is magnificent 
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:19:22
Yeah and I'm sure they take fees 
But maybe not as much as PayPal 
And we are talking about ebay so it would have to be marked as pay in cash or something because there is no crypto option and that's were the problem is 
If there was a cheap highly trusted site for escrow it would be ideal for this situation
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:38:40
Oh yeah no doubt or maybe adyen could support crypto to make it easier for eBay to consider it... 
Be massive for crypto
@_date: 2018-06-19 00:55:44
Yeah but if he sent you Bitcoin then you could just not send the item. You might get bad eBay feedback but so what free money just open a new account. PayPal atleast give the customer protection somewhat from this. 
Not bashing Bitcoin but people arnt honest enough not to have escrow. 
So for Bitcoin to be useful for eBay selling and buying from strangers we need a Bitcoin escrow service but then the service would need to make money ect 
This is why smart contracts could be very useful 
Or Bitcoin multisig could work ? 
But it's to technical

Yes 
You have to swipe your card 
And then it loads 
Then you have to choose your account 
And then it loads
Then You have to type your pin ( which you can't customise so I have to remember a new pin )
It's about 10 seconds and some extra thinking that I don't want to have to do 
@_date: 2015-07-31 06:25:39

I got scammed years ago already by coinlenders.com

Hello 
Ether went up to around $6 each in a week from $2
Then went slightly down
So I'm guessing a load of people sold for Bitcoin before a crash? 
Or Bitcoin started going up and used there ether to buy btc causing ether to drop slightly

Sounds like your just trying to profit on the daily price increase / decrease  in bitcoin, best bet would be use usd tether on an exchange or sell for a alt coin that doesn't move up or down much. But that's all I can think of. Your. Bank will prob call you asking wtf are you doing if you keep withdrawing and depositing 100k at a time. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:59:22
If someone stole this and somehow got to the cash draw or what ever it uses.. could they just keep giving the machines $100 bills taking bitcoin and then getting the $100 out of the machine and do it over and over again ? 
Seems risky if this could happen as ATMs get stolen all the time... 
If they have to keep the machine  turned on I can see a bad guy doing a scene from Seinfeld where George plays Frogger IRL with a frogger machine

If you run a business that accepts bitcoin instead of fiat you still have to pay tax as that's the law... the government will just have to accept bitcoin as payment for tax  
It's simple.. 
Then I'm sure people will try to hide their income as it's more private then the current system but then the tax department will just have to Develop ways to be able to monitor income via the blockchain.. like stores will have to keep their transaction history for 5 years or what ever and they can be audited at anytime then someone would have to go through the ledger and check all the transactions are accounted for...
Prob be a Pos system developed where they can just store it all to a flash drive then sent off to a crypto accountant 
I donno anything about this stuff but seams easy enough ? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:18:35
No dont compare them to baseball cards dude compare them to having US dollars in cash in Australia you can't just go to the shop and buy some kangaroo meat with the US dollar... and if it's in your bank account You will have to exchange it ( the bank will do it for you and charge You fees ) to use your US ATM card in Australia. 
Also if I want to buy 100 hardrives from my Friend who lives in China I can send him bitcoin... how you gonna send I'm baseball cards via the mail ? No take to long 
Bitcoin is faster and cheaper then any other way ( bank transfer weston union  ect ) to send money internationally...
People just need to learn about it and it will be adopted 
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:00:52
Jeez,  what makes bitcoin hypothetical... fiat is just pieces of worthless paper... which only has value because everyone agrees it does... same with bitcoin 
So it's the same thing dude one is just digital.. 
and then it has a big stack of advantages over physical cash... 
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:42:44
You could make an ico for these shirts dude 
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:02:01
Jeez "...4% and 8% of the transaction value."
Just but from an Australian exchange, btc markets .com.au and CoinJar are 1% and you can hold your btc on there if you want to make payments ( I know you shouldn't but CoinJar has been around for a while...) with the ATM don't you have to pay the 4% and then also a bitcoin transaction fee ? It seems like the most expensive way to buy and sell bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:07:16
Search rise, it's a newish coin. Just had huge 360% gains last week,
Then crashed big time again. Now seems to be pumping again. Will most likely crash again. If you are so good with stocks you should be able to get in and out to make profits. 
Most cheap alt coins do this. Most of the time you will buy at the very top and then panic and sell when it dips. 
Then it will pump again the next day and you will be kicking your self . 
But anything in the top 10 on coin market cap .com have been better in the past year then anything on Wall Street ( probably I don't know anything about stocks )
But if you have 500$ in bitcoin or $500 in ripple and the price goes up by 5% you will be making the same gains... 
So it doesn't matter if bitcoin costs more.. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:55:36

That's how I think it should be with everything in stores should be it should see the transactions being broadcast and that should be enough.
But it would be less secure obviously but if say was a loyal customer they should trust me enough to pay if I trust them enough to buy from them... then it would get rid of the need for bigger blocks..? 
I'm not sure if my transaction with steam was confirmed first because it was pretty quick but it wasn't instant it was around 5 min that I got an email from steam saying thanks for the purchase and I could download it

Or just anytime traders 
Or traders ??!?!!!

I was paper wallets for years
Then I got a ledger 
I feel 100% more secure with the ledger
First... the ink on the paper could fade over time 
A crinkle in the paper could make the qr code unreadable...
Paper could get wet and ink could run 
Someone comes to your house if they know something about bitcoin and they could just take a photo of your wallet and they have the keys 
Or steel your wallet and all the btc
Ledger you need to type in a password to access your account ( and a computer )
And then when withdrawing  btc you need the security card that it came with or the app on your phone what should have its own security anyway 
And then you have back up your ledger with a seed in case you lose it or it gets stolen 
:p

the original is good tho because i like putting the pin in the chrome application rather then the ledger nano s

just wish the original had the same support as the nano s

And when you talk to people about it all you need to say is buy $200 worth of bitcoin

Then when they get it it will just say .1btc and then most likely it will convert it to USD under it or near it so I'm sure they will understand what's going on...

yep, they say "its not real"  then i say just because its digital doesnt mean its not real... no one gets paid in cash anymore ( well some do but most don't (in australia)) so debit credit isnt real... same thing i try to say, if they saw the ledger account with bitcoin it really does look like your own bank so that would convince them, tho the hard bit would be getting them to buy one and put on there ledger nano... and i dont want them to see mine incase of NV

Why would I lie. 
In Australia if you want to be a tradesman you need to do an aprenticeship 
And I started one of them and get $600 a week 
Last job I was getting 4.5 k a month because of overtime 
But it was a shit job so I started this job because in 4 years when I get my trade I will be making big $ just from now to then I need to make some good financial decisions 
:)

It really is a hassle

Got a site ?

You will be better off joining up to a good exchange that is based in your country so you can link your bank account
Then you can deposit the money 
The first time will take longer but times after that should be same day
Then when you want to cash out you can just sell back to the exchange and withdraw your money 
In Australia my local exchanges accept poli 
That is pretty good 
But if your set on credit card see coinbase

Yeah but the blocks are just groups of transactions 
Surely nodes can get a bunch of transactions 
Chuck em in a folder 
Use win zip or something make em a nice small package 
Then send it on to another node to extract all confirm on there ledger and zip it in a folder again but maybe bigger this time as this would be the second confirmation then so on creating confirmations like this 
So all the computer power at nodes would be reading transactions and updating ledger then sending them on to the next one 
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:47:53
Yes this does help 
 But now it makes me think 
why do the miners need to put them in blocks
Why can the nodes and p2p be enough to lock it in to the network ?

iv tried to spread the word with friends but they are all cynical AF,
everytime it has a good pump im telling them see i told you you should have got some BTC but they just reply sell its gonna crash.
i even lost a bet a while ago (when the prices were $400) the bet was it will go up to 500 by the next time i saw him. it went up a little but then down by the the time i saw him and said would you like the winnings in fiat or btc and he said fiat. if he chose btc his winnings would be worth 6x as of today, so that was a good way at getting back at him i saw how was your $50, if you chose btc and held it would be $300 :0
