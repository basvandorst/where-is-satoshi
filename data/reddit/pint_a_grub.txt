.....because so many people with money want to live there. 
All major metropolitan cities have problems. Not unique to Chicago. 
Yes, Rahm was a staunch conservative Neo liberal. We have 40 years of history telling us those economies of division and privatization don’t work in mass.
Too early to criticize light foot. 
Doesn’t change the fact that you chose to socialize with doosh bags.

Sure, and if you’re poor it’s easy to Move state to state. If your invested and diversified it’s not easy to move.


All states you would be ok moving to for lower or similar capital gains taxes. However if your diversified and hold property and business licenses it wouldn’t be worth moving.

That’s not my opinion that’s just facts I put forward. 
The problem with Florida, Wyoming, and even Texas to a degree is the lack of startup opportunity. It’s why those states have to consistently poach established business from blue states.

Yeah, Austin is a great example of having to poach.

Illinois is one of the best states for high income individuals. Only 3-4 states with lower tax rates. 
Illinois Is in the top 5 for highest tax rates on low income individuals. 
If your poor it sucks to live here. If your rich it’s great.

Lol, this is laughably stupid. They non existent. The current underworld in Chicago is controlled by an alliance of the cartel and the outfit.
@_date: 2019-11-05 01:16:25
Not at all. Definitely not a shit hole. Just was rated the best city to live in By leisure magazine. And it’s consistently rated in the top for the last 10 years of places to live. 
Outside of Chicago metro Illinois is very beautiful as well.

Most consensus shows us that lots of people will get back in anything remotely near 3k. 
I can only pray it goes that low.
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:35:53
That will be 1/20th a Bitcoin.

This right here. I dint understand anyone that thinks sell! When it goes down. That just seems batshit insane to me. I get giddy when we have huge drops. Like that’s what I’m waiting for! I got in at $939 out at 6k, 10k and 14k. Then back in at 8k and 4 k. Then out at 10k. I’m ready to get all back in At 5k and 4k.
@_date: 2019-11-22 05:38:01
5k because Ive marked shelf’s at 4800 and 3800

Sounds like you hung out with normal doosh bags that are generic to every major city. It’s a reflection upon yourself if that’s who you chose to experience the city with.

This isn’t relevant at all. Illinois Is in the top 5 lowest tax brackets for reporting large capital gains Taxes. Not sure why you would move.
@_date: 2019-11-05 19:04:59
Because I’m in a Higher tax bracket and have a couple of business here. Moving would result in me paying significantly more in taxes.

No doubt NY state is also a good place for start up business.
