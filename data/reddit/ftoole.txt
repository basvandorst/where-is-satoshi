In the original BTC code thier was no block size cap. It was planned to be removed once their were enough SPV wallets out their. The block size cap was put in to prevent miners from creating huge blocks and making users unable to use their QT wallets. But with all of the SPV's out their this is no longer an issue. It is sad that Satoshi left before the cap could be removed as was originally planned.

I have an C plan with 99 investments with a projected apr of 8.27% per JAM. 48 of the loans are current 13 loans have been repaid 38 loans are late or have been in late status but not repaid. I project a -3.13% return based on (Payments made on current loans+ Payments made on repaid loans + Payments made on Late loan +Future payments on currentloans)/Investment amount -1

Actually I did some math lets say Jam makes 1k btc of loans a week. so 52k BTC a year. they charge a 4% fee on every loan that is only 2080 BTC. Which is about 605k a year this seems like a lot yes. They have 13 staff members according to   They have an office in the bay area which I am sure they pay a premium for also and decent talent in the Bay area costs a decent amount of money. If they evenly split 605k between the 13 employees it would be about 46k each. Do I think the owners of Jam are getting rich no. I think they are living off of venture capital they are trying to find a way to be profitable for them selves and to be Profitable to investors.
In my real job I work with Banks I deal with small and medium banks I have also worked on a few contracts with large banks but I enjoy working with small and medium banks a lot more and try to work with them. I Have spoken with many lenders from different part of the US and even in other countries and the thing they all say is its easy to find people who wish to borrow money the hard thing is to find the ones that will pay it back.

One reason thier are few ways to buy BTC with a CC is that they can easily be charged back to the merchant after the sale has been completed. Also the card processing networks will more often side with the cardholder on digital goods.

So how many investments do you have in your plan?
I have an AB plan with 100 investments with a projected apr of 30.53% per JAM.
68 of the loans are current
16 loans have been repaid
16 loans are late or have been in late status but not repaid.
I project a 9.22% return based on (Payments made on current loans+ Payments made on repaid loans + Payments made on Late loan +Future payments on currentloans)/Investment amount -1

also you gotta stay away from the high interest loans. Also remember most of the people on the leaderboard have less than 1 btc in performing loans. Most large investors have no higher than a 50% NAR. It is difficult but over time you can find the good borrowers to keep from loosing it all. Also if you look at the leader board look at swiss watcher and bitmaster their loans to each other and thier group help keep them on it.
