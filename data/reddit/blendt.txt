And you do know the FBI has certain rules and a jurisdiction they have to follow too right? If anything this would fall under the CIA's jurisdiction, but definitely not the FBI. If anything I'd say the .ac domain was the honeypot as that is not an "anonymous" handle either.

Do you know what ad hominem means? It's a really common expression and I'm kind of embarrassed for you. It's a logical fallacy that you seem to be fond of. You see people use logical fallacies when they don't have anything solid to support their point. Your last comment is a wonderful example 
of ad hominem.

Ad hominem seems to be your defense mechanism. Cute.

Good intellectual comeback. That totally proved your point correct...

I'm not a bitcoin lover. Also ad hominem. I just followed you to discredit the garbage you're spewing.

I really don't know why the first insult you go to is unemployment. I'm a systems admin chilling at work now mate. Projecting much? Do you need a list of logical fallacies? Do you even remember what you were arguing? When you want to actually debate and not just throw around fallacies let me know

Anybody connected to a torrent that you're connected to can see your IP address. On any site. That is fundamentally how P2P torrents work. They can seed any number of torrents to see any number of IP addresses. There are not "better" sites. So by saying the FBI runs it, there's not anything more that they can get besides IP that they couldn't get on literally any torrent.

If you haven't noticed, the alleged "correct site" that "Anonymous" posted went down 2 days after and never came back up again. It's been down 18 days straight and only had an uptime of like 36 hours. If that's not the fishiest shit you've ever heard of.

How self centered do you have to be to believe that. All you do is use ad hominem. Heaven forbid someone else calls you out on your shit. Delusion is a funny thing.
