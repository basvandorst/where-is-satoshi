Hey - if you're starting from scratch and you're serious I would recommend reading a book on Technical Analysis. The classic reference is this one: 
You can learn it all online quite easily though. I can't think of one resource that covers it all, but these subreddits are a good place to get started:

Spam prevention is actually an important part of Bitcoin's heritage. In that HashCash proposed a proof-of-work system to solve this problem and Bitcoin was influenced by HashCash:

True. In the end it all comes down to trust. I hope we can earn it from the community.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:33:28
We're still working on the exact subscription model. Probably a similar ballpark.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:46:02
Thanks for signing up. We'll try to get you an invite out within the next couple of weeks.

Well to begin with there are overheads involved in running the operation. You have to pay someone to sit and answer phone calls, for example.
Then, and I'm not claiming to be an expert here, I would imagine that they use some form of clearing house to settle the payments, and they in turn presumably charge the bank a fee for that service.
Also there's a little risk involved. Some amount of time will pass between the point at which the bank quotes you a rate and the point when you accept the deal and your funds are available to make the transaction. The market exchange rate could move in that time.

It's an interesting idea to us and someone else asked about it earlier - check out the discussion here: 
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:10:20
Yes, that's the plan. Although it will be slightly skewed towards those with previous algo trading experience so we can get valuable feedback early on.
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:02:44
Hey - the plan is to support Mtgox, BTC-e and Bitstamp to begin with. More will be added based on demand.
Please see this thread for more about security:

Hey, James from Tradewave here.
We don't trade, front-run or access our user's strategies (unless specifically asked, e.g. for support purposes) and this is written into our terms and conditions: 
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:03:26
Thanks, drop me an email at hello and mention that you have experience with trading bots. It would be great to get your feedback.
@_date: 2014-04-12 19:18:39
Forex with cryptocurrencies has some of the same costs attached; it's just how markets work. There's cost involved when you want to exchange Bitcoin for Litecoin.
You have to pay a fee at the exchange. Also if you want to complete the transaction immediately you'll need to pay the spread.
@_date: 2014-11-03 11:11:50
I could steal goods from my local store quite easily. It's very tempting to get stuff for free. Who wouldn't?
It's sad how jaded the crypto community has become; although I guess it's understandable given the history of scammy companies in the space.
Yes, at the end of it all, there is a large element of trust. But we've been hosting user strategies without issues since January; I think we've earned it.

That's the Bitcoin Center NYC. It's a stone's throw from the New York Stock Exchange.
This seems to be the official page:

If someone has physically compromised your system then there's plenty more damage they could do too. Luckily I think physical access is probably the easiest thing to secure compared to myriad other ways in which you can be compromised.
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:58:41
Hey - we're using a combination of whitelisting imports and OS-level sandboxing. Sandboxing Python scripts is known to be difficult, but it is possible and secure.
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:49:50
That's correct.
@_date: 2014-01-16 19:56:53
We only plan to support Python at this time.
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:56:12
Our policy is never to view your code unless it is for support (i.e. we have your permission) or maintenance purposes. This will be part of the license agreement when you sign up.
'We' is me (for now), an experienced polyglot programmer from the UK. I've built similar systems before as well as my own personal crypto trading bots from scratch. I get more satisfaction in building products than trading algorithms though, hence this service.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:38:01
That's correct, each bot runs on a separate process. Without wishing to expose the exact details to the world at large, the bot basically persists a temporary token that will let it decrypt your API keys, so it doesn't need to store them in plaintext.
Ideally it would only need to store your keys in memory, but then the server might crash and you can't restart the bot. I think this is a good compromise.
Edit: I should mention that with the token it still needs to fetch your encrypted API keys from a secure database located on another server. So an attacker would have to compromise two systems.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:04:21
We'll provide a set of pre-written scripts for you to play around with, so that should help.
Python is generally considered to be one of the easiest languages to learn.
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:28:12
Hey, thanks for your interest - no, you won't be able to install your own libraries, as that would be a security nightmare, but we will make lots of useful 3rd party modules like Scipy and Numpy available for use in your scripts.
For now your strategy will need to fit into one file. I can see how that might become unwieldy though, so we'll monitor the situation and if enough people ask for it, we'll add the ability to split it up into multiple files.
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:51:17
It's not in our best interests to steal your strategies or trade against you. We're in this for the long haul; I want to create a community around this and a subscription service for hosting your bots is just the beginning.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:04:08
We're planning to support Mtgox, BTC-e and Bitstamp. Possibly others.
@_date: 2014-11-04 10:05:45
I'm not looking down on anybody. I understand the concern and we receive questions to this effect quite frequently.
What upsets and offends me about the original comment is that it's *assumed* that we will steal user's strategies, as if no rational group of individuals tasked with storing privileged information could possibly resist it.
Anyway, I don't wish to start a flame war. I understand if you or anyone else would prefer to host strategies on your own system and that's your prerogative.
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:06:51
No plans for that, but feel free to reach out at a later date once things have settled.
I haven't thought about this enough to decide whether this is something the exchanges should provide, something we should provide or something that a completely separate company/service could deal with.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:02:06
Our policy is never to access user code unless it is for support or maintenance purposes. We'll write this up in a license when you join.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:53:47
That's correct, you store your API keys with us. I'm pasting a similar answer I gave here:
They're encrypted and stored in our database, such that your Tradewave account password is required to decrypt them. We prompt for your password when you try to start a live trading bot so that the bot can access those API keys, but we don't store the plaintext anywhere.
Feel free to PM me if you'd like more details.
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:15:29
This really isn't breaking news. Transferring money internationally does cost the bank something so of course they're not going to do it for free.
They do charge too much, but that's a separate debate.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:39:16
Thanks. We're aiming to start seeding it with users within the next couple of weeks.
@_date: 2015-01-29 20:43:21
Good to see you again! Hope we can tempt you back.
@_date: 2015-01-30 10:09:19
Take a look here for some starting ideas and links to resources: 
There are also quite a few strategy ideas in our forums: 
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:06:05
We've had a lot of requests for Coinbase support, so we'll be working on that over the coming days.
It's still early days but we've had paying customers since last May when we launched live trading.
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:11:16
Don't forget to check out our other thread here: 
@_date: 2015-01-30 09:58:50
Agree completely. At this point it's more of a legal/regulatory challenge than an engineering one.
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:09:10
It should have a stabilising effect long-term as it encourages higher volume.
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:51:42
Hey, founder here. Good question.
It's currently geared towards traders with some previous knowledge of Bitcoin, because you need an exchange account to use our service.
But ideally there would be a way to onboard users who are brand new to the Bitcoin ecosystem by allowing them to purchase  BTC directly through us and start trading that balance. That's something that might come later down the road.
@_date: 2015-02-04 03:17:54
We apologise if it comes across as deceiving and that honestly wasn't the intention.
That being said, I think it's fair to say that placing $500 in your account for a month, such that you're not liable for any loss, counts as 'free credit'. It's a pretty good deal.
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:05:32
Yes this requires one of Tradewave's paid live trading subscriptions. The offer is from Coinsetter.
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:20:55
Fair enough, thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:20:20
For more context, these islands also allow no motorised transport, so the taxis are actually horses and carts. Interesting place.
