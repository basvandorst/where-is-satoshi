Why is "ripping off" the original codebase a bad thing? Forking code happens literally all the time in any open source software. Its not something we should say is bad.

I don't think $30 fees and long transaction times count as working flawlessly.

Same situation for me. I put some BTC on there but now I can't withdraw because they didn't grandfather in old unverified accounts that didn't originally have trade limits.

I sent a 1Sat/b transaction a little under two weeks ago, hope it clears soon.

I've been hearing quite a bit about how segwit drastically decreases fees. Which wallets support segwit?

Regardless of the fact that he called you stupid, mining on paper (or by yourself on your computer) is impractical as big mining pools will pretty much 100% of the time be faster than you are.

AFAIK lightning alone isn't capable of scaling up to VISA levels, but I'm not really sure about how the tech works so I may be wrong, but I don't think your title is fair as it implies that 555MB blocks would only offer the same amount of transactions as SegWit + LN.
